Michael Howard has survived a string of disasters as Home Secretary
but now the clamour for his departure grows daily, Benedict Brogan
reports
HAS Michael Howard's luck run out? Sir John Learmont's devastating
report on the state of the English prison system, and the resultant
sacking of Prison Service director-general Derek Lewis, have brought
down on the Home Secretary's head the sort of public relations disaster
that would have killed off in an instant any other Cabinet minister's
career.
But Howard remains in place, backed against Jack Straw's demands for
his resignation by the Prime Minister at Question Time yesterday. Like
an adventure book hero, with one bound he was free. Or is he? The
prisons fiasco is only the latest in an extraordinary string of
disasters that have dogged his two years at the Home Office. The clamour
for his departure grows daily, and now even Tory stalwarts are beginning
to lose faith.
The Tory-supporting Daily Telegraph declared yesterday: ''He cannot
claim credit for being tough unless he also accepts that the buck stops
not with the director-general but with him''. The Times agreed: ''Mr
Howard is, strictly speaking, cleared of culpability. Few however will
see the Home Secretary as wholly immune from blame.''
Prisons have been the millstone around Howard's neck. Last year five
IRA prisoners escaped from Whitemoor prison, forcing him to set up the
Learmont inquiry. In January three men escaped from Parkhurst prison.
Elsewhere, his Criminal Justice Bill prompted rioting and opposition
from the police and judiciary. His decision to introduce a new
compensation scheme for the victims of crime was declared unlawful by
the House of Lords because he failed to consult Parliament.
In fact the pitfalls awaiting the holder of the third greatest office
of state are legion. Howard can console himself with the knowledge that
every one of his predecessors has, like him, gone to bed dreading the
late-night phone call announcing the unpredictable: a bomb, a prison
break, or a security foul-up for which he is ultimately responsible.
For Tory Home Secretaries the unpredictable is compounded by the
entirely predictable blood lust of the party faithful, who demand from
their man the sort of toughness that makes Attila the Hun look like
Cinderella. Only last week Howard was wowing them in Blackpool with his
promise to put thousands more policemen on the beat and to impose
stiffer sentences on repeat offenders. ''If you worry about doing the
time, don't do the crime,'' he declared, clearly unaware that Sir John
Learmont's inquiry into prison security was about to show that his
prison service poses few worries for criminals at all.
Howard, 54, was born and schooled in Wales before going up to
Cambridge where he became president of the union and fell in with the
group now known as the Cambridge mafia: Norman Lamont, John Gummer, and
Leon Brittan. He trained as a barrister and took silk in 1982.
He entered the Commons in 1983 as MP for Folkestone and Hythe. In 1975
he married the glamorous Sandra Paul, a three-times-married once-famous
60s model who continues to turn heads on the ministerial cocktail
circuit. They have two children and one stepson. Howard is Jewish and
will be familiar with the Tory party's insidious, exquisitely-phrased
anti-Semitism.
Although he has managed to lose his Welshness, his voice retains a
certain whisper-whisper unctuousness to it which, with his unavoidable
barrister's arrogance, makes him sound suspiciously smooth. While his
determination to tackle crime and reorganise the police and prison
service has earned him support from his colleagues, his persistent
opposition to the death penalty and his resistance to calls for a
compulsory identity card suggest beneath the extreme exterior there
hides a dangerous liberal.
The secret of his survival lies in his absolute loyalty to John Major.
Although a renowned Euro-sceptic, who as Employment Secretary pushed for
the Maastricht Treaty opt out on the social chapter, Howard has backed
the Prime Minister against the Euro-rebels both in and out of Cabinet.
In the leadership contest last summer he was one of the first to offer
help in mounting Major's campaign.
This has helped him to cling on. Labour has made a running out of the
reluctance of Tory ministers to take responsibility and resign when
things go wrong on their watch. The last Home Secretary to offer to go
was William Whitelaw after an intruder found his way to the Queen's bed.
In 1983 James Prior refused to resign following the mass escape from the
Maze prison in Northern Ireland.
But Howard's future prospects look grim. He is known to harbour
aspirations for the Foreign Secretary's job, but that reward went to
Malcolm Rifkind in the summer reshuffle. In fact, of his six Tory
predecessors, only two -- Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Clarke -- were
promoted. This latest setback will confirm what has been apparent for
some time: he has risen as far as the unpredictable will allow.

Terezin housed a vast number of artists, most of whom would be wiped
out
Michael Tumelty recalls how a holding camp for Auschwitz became a
seedbed for an extraordinary flowering of creative activity and
describes The Terezin Operas being presented by the MacRobert Arts
Centre
EXACTLY 54 years ago yesterday, on October 17, 1941, two Nazi generals
held a meeting in Prague. One of them was Adolf Eichmann, the monstrous
creature who was to be in charge of the extermination of the Jews.
The subject of the meeting, couched in thinly coded terms in the
minutes, was the logistical issue of processing to their deaths the vast
number of Jews in Czechoslovakia. (This meeting, it might be noted, was
taking place three months before the notorious Wannsee Conference on the
Final Solution of the Jewish Question.)
It was recorded in the notes of the meeting that there were ''problems
with the evacuation of the Jews''. Simply and chillingly put, there were
too many to handle in a necessarily efficient manner. The meeting
proposed the establishment of a holding camp close to a railway. That
railway would lead directly to the death camp at Auschwitz.
''Three trains a day, each carrying a thousand Jews, will be required.
From this transit camp, it will be simple to transport the Jews to the
East,'' said the report.
The site chosen was the garrison town of Terezin -- Theresienstadt --
about an hour outside Prague. Built by Emperor Joseph II, the son of
Maria Theresa, the fortress town was constructed to be impregnable from
without, and -- from the Nazis' point of view -- inescapable from
within. Effectively it would function as a ghetto.
Transports began soon after the generals' meeting, and Jews sent to
the camp remained there a few months before being packed on to trains to
be sent on to the death camp.
By the time the Soviet Army liberated Terezin in 1945, almost 140,000
Jews had passed through the camp. Perhaps by geographical coincidence,
Terezin housed a vast number of artists -- writers, painters, poets,
musicians, conductors, and composers: an entire generation, most of whom
would be wiped out.
They included Jewish musicians from the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonic
Orchestras, and conductors such as the great Czech, Karel Ancerl, who
was sent on to Auschwitz -- which he survived, though his family did
not.
Early on in the days of the camp, a committee of elders had persuaded
the Nazis that, if the interned musicians could be allowed some cultural
activity, it would alleviate the difficulties in running an already
overcrowded camp.
The Germans capitulated, and Terezin became -- amid all the attendant
horrors of the situation -- a seedbed for an extraordinary flowering of
creative activity.
On the music front alone, there were performances of operas -- The
Bartered Bride, Tosca, and Die Fledermaus; Haydn's Creation -- the
ultimate musical irony on the road to extinction -- was performed. At
least 15 performances of Verdi's Requiem were staged. Chamber music,
jazz, cabaret, poetry readings, and art classes took place.
Among the inmates were two composers, Hans Krasa and Viktor Ullman,
who actually created new work in the camp. They went on to Auschwitz and
did not survive. Their work did, and this week The Terezin Operas, as
they are known -- two one-act operas by the composers -- are being
presented by the MacRobert Arts Centre at Stirling University.
The production is by Mecklenburgh Opera, an ambitious young
London-based company which has won a Prudential Award for their
innovative work, and the band in the pit will be Scotland's Paragon
Ensemble, conducted by Mecklenburgh's musical director, Anne Manson.
Of the two operas, Krasa's Brundibar was actually written in 1938.
When he was sent to Terezin, the composer could take only the vocal
score with him, so he reconstructed the opera in the camp, where it
received over 50 performances.
Ullman's The Emperor of Atlantis, the more obviously subversive of the
two, fared less well. It got as far as the final rehearsal when its
message -- ''like Brundibar, it's about Hitler,'' said John Abulafia,
director of Mecklenburgh Opera -- was recognised and the work was
banned.
''Mind you, it wasn't spotted immediately, and they actually got an SS
guard to type out the libretto on the back of death forms,'' said
Abulafia. ''He must have been really thick not to spot it.''
Both operas are subversive, said the director, because they are both
about the defeat of tyranny. ''They are both empowering; they were a way
of giving the inmates hope.''
Stylistically, said Abulafia, Brundibar -- a children's opera which
will feature 40 local schoolchildren -- is out of the Czech operetta
tradition, while The Emperor of Atlantis, in which the music itself is a
message, is out of the Austro-German tradition, from Mahler to Kurt
Weill.
''It's like a cabaret show about despair,'' said the director,
''though as the opera takes wing, it says: even if we die in this
madness, this world has to end; the mad Emperor cannot last.''
Before being herded unceremoniously on to the train that would take
him to Auschwitz, the composer Viktor Ullman recorded his own thoughts
on the Terezin experience. ''It must be emphasised that Theresienstadt
has served to enhance, not impede, my musical activities.
''By no means did we sit weeping on the banks of the waters of
Babylon; our endeavour with respect to art was commensurate with our
will to live.''
* The Terezin Operas, MacRobert Arts Centre, Stirling. Tomorrow until
Saturday, 7.30pm.

Anne Johnstone continues the series with a portrait of Nuremberg -- a
twin
city with a difference
Now nobody wants to go
back to
how it was before
IF YOU think Glasgow still suffers from an image problem, spare a
thought for its twin city of Nuremberg. There are two images associated
with Nuremberg, both supremely unhelpful to a city trying to forge a new
identity to carry it into the twenty-first century.
In the eyes of the world Nuremberg is synonymous with the history of
national socialism. Today the city is coy and confused about its Nazi
past. The tourist information centre offers little information about the
Nuremberg Rallies and Hitler's now dilapidated unfinished Congress Hall,
based on Rome's Colosseum, is used for a stage because no-one can decide
whether to restore or demolish it.
Inside Germany, Nuremberg is viewed as a small provincial city famous
for its gingerbread, sausages and picturesque medieval core. And yet
while the city's rattly old trams complement this quaint image, down the
road AEG and Siemens are producing the most comfortable elegant
futuristic tramcars in the world. Diehl, the Swiss-watch people, make
their satellite-controlled wrist watches here too.
Nuremberg's success in attracting and keeping employment has been
reflected in a rising population (currently 496,000). Of course, people
settle there not just because they can get jobs but because, even by
German standards, it offers an enviable quality of life.
I was surprised when my guide, Georg Escher, political correspondent
of the Nurnberger Nachrichten, opted to entertain me on a rooftop beer
garden at one of Nuremberg's busiest intersections. In a Scottish city,
you would be deafened and choked in such a location.
There, we chatted over our bratwurst and blonde beer, while a constant
stream of cyclists passed along the specially designed track below.
Opposite, tramcars pottered by every couple of minutes, while in the
middle a few cars occasionally drifted up to the lights.
''Here everything runs according to plan,'' boasts a brochure for the
VAG, Nuremberg's public transport company which runs the city's 300
buses, 150 trams and 70 underground trains, which carry 143 million
passengers a year between them.
On the face of it Nuremberg is doing well in the war against
congestion. The proportion of trips made by car is 44%, the same as in
1976. About 37% of journeys are on foot or by bike, a tally Glasgow can
only dream of. The remaining 19% use public transport. Nevertheless,
this is in the context of people making far more journeys so in fact,
the number of cars registered in Nuremberg has risen from 140,000 in
1976 to 220,000 today.
In an attempt to reverse this trend and steer people on to the public
transport system or bikes, VAG has adopted one of the boldest transport
strategies in the world. ''It's based on what we call 'push and pull'.
You say 'stick and carrot','' says Christa Frankenberger of VAG.
The sticks include deliberately exorbitant parking charges, giving
bikes and public transport priority at junctions, extending and
rigorously enforcing a 30km-per-hour speed limit in certain areas and a
raft of traffic calming measures, including cutting some roads
altogether.
''It isn't popular but we have no alternative,'' says Frau
Frankenberger who admits the difficulty of avoiding the Big Brother
image while selling such measures to a sceptical public. But it has
worked before.
The main roads running north to south and east to west through the old
town used to carry 30,000 vehicles a day. Today only buses and
pedestrians are allowed in. ''People said it would be chaotic but it
wasn't. Now nobody wants to go back to how it was before,'' she says.
The secret, she adds, is to introduce incentives at the same time.
These carrots include: extending the underground, building a light
railway, creating new bike, tram and bus lanes and increasing the speed,
comfort, frequency and punctuality of public transport.
If Nuremberg's plan succeeds, car journeys will go down to 30% and
public transport trips rise to the same figure with pedestrians and
cyclists making up the other 40%.
Though the federal government contributes to infrastructure
investments (eg 60% of the planned light railway) German cities don't
have to queue up cap-in-hand for such contributions in the way British
ones do. Here such developments require individual acts of Parliament.
Compared with Glasgow, and indeed Lille and Seville, the other cities
covered in this series, Nuremberg is delightfully litter-free. This
partly reflects German attitudes to such matters (''We find it
extraordinary how little respect people have for the environment in
Britain,'' says Escher).
It also reflects a policy of minimising waste in a city where the
Green Party holds the balance of power. Throwaway packaging, crockery
and cutlery has been banned from public events. The famous Christmas
market which once generated about 700,000 throwaway plastic cups has
gone over entirely to ceramic cups.
Unavoidable waste is recycled. Nuremberg was the first city to force
its households to separate their waste. ''There were many doubts and
complaints,'' recalls environmental planner Dr Susanne Schimmack, but an
intense marketing and public education campaign swung public opinion in
favour.
Now four different-coloured bins stand at each front door and everyone
dutifully separates cardboard, glass, bio-waste and packaging or risks a
fine. McDonald's were whipped into line when the city authorities
threatened to refuse to collect unseparated waste.
Because German local authorities can pass their own bylaws and fix
waste fees, they have much more power than their Scottish counterparts
in dictating waste management policy.
The traditional argument against green waste policies is that they
force up manufacturing costs. ''But there's another side,'' says
Schimmack. ''We're forced to invent new techniques and machines which
other countries will have to buy.'' Indeed, environmental technology is
a major growth area in the world economy and Nuremberg already boasts
350 companies working in this field. How many do we have?
In housing too, Nuremberg has gone for a bold strategy which seems to
have worked, though some would ask at what price. A gaudy mural in the
local underground station declares: ''Gostenhof is alive'' and it's
true. Today that area brims with Turkish pavement cafes and kebab
houses, leafy children's play areas and bright gable end murals. Ten
years ago Gostenhof was the worst slum in Bavaria, known locally as ''an
area of shattered glass''. The transformation didn't come cheap. More
than #20m has been spent on around 3000 households.
The houses were upgraded, windows replaced and inside toilets
installed but turning Gostenhof around depended just as much on the wide
range of general environmental improvements. In one instance #700,000
was spent on purchasing and demolishing an old refrigeration plant
covering less than one acre, removing and replacing heavily polluted
soil and transforming the area into a new kickabout space.
Eleven urban renewal areas in this city received the same intensive
therapy and in 16 more the municipality placed controls on upgrading by
private landlords in order to stabilise the area.
''It's a balancing act. We want improvements in housing conditions but
if the process goes too far, rents rise too far and the poorer people
have to leave,'' says Hans Joachim Schlobl, Nuremberg's director of
housing and urban renewal.
There are also strict rules about new developments, 30% of which must
go to social housing. ''The objective is to get a mixed housing stock
and population and avoid extreme segregations,'' he said. There are no
''areas of shattered glass'' in Nuremberg today.
The closest thing they have to Easterhouse or Drumchapel is
Langwasser, once the Nazis play area, now a green swathe dotted with
bright, solid, carefree, low-rise flats and served by the Underground
and a network of cycleways. People ask to move there.
When you see just how well Nuremberg seems to work, it's tempting to
think that they have all the answers. Of course, it isn't true.
How boom turned to bust in 18 months
NUREMBERG'S success story first started to look a bit shaky in
mid-1992 when the reunification boom abruptly turned into something like
the reunification bust. In 18 months, 15,000 jobs were lost in
manufacturing. For the first time in years unemployment in Nuremberg hit
9.5%, higher than the national average.
Why has Nuremberg been hit so badly? First, proximity to the former
GDR means there are some excellent EU and German state-funded location
packages on offer which has the effect of diverting inward investment.
Second, Nuremberg is short of greenfield sites and a plan to develop the
so-called ''garlic fields'' to the north is being resisted by the Green
Party.
Also business rates in Nuremberg are high. No wonder when you see the
scope of local government programmes. But this in itself deters inward
investment and drives some firms away. Recently a major pencil
manufacturer employing 1200 people ostentatiously moved out of the city
after using full-page newspaper ads to accuse the city of pricing itself
out of the market.
At the same time Nuremberg is losing jobs to Eastern Europe. The great
mail order firm Quelle have moved their distribution centre to Leipzig
along with 1000 jobs. ABB, the steel casting company, has moved its
plant to the Czech Republic.
Like Glasgow, Nuremberg suffers from what could be called the ''branch
economy syndrome'' and recently this has cost the city dear. For
instance, when Tempo the tissue makers were taken over by Proctor and
Gamble, the American company said the 1000 jobs in Nuremberg would be
saved but changed their minds a few months later. The worst blow was the
decision by Siemens to move their massive traffic and transport division
to Berlin.
Yet despite the recent jobs haemorrhage Nuremberg's population has
been growing as immigrants flood in from former eastern Europe,
particularly the former GDR. Since 1990 there have been 30,000 of them.
Everyone I met seemed philosophical about this, though I couldn't help
wondering how those on the rapidly lengthening council house waiting
list feel about immigrant families taking up new social housing. Around
9000 units have been built in the past three years but there are still
21,000 people waiting. At the same time there has been an unprecedented
squeeze on public spending, forcing the city to turn to foreign-made
low-cost prefabricated buildings.
Schlobl predicts worse to come. Under the German system, private
contractors build social housing for a fee. The municipality then has
the use of it for a set time before it reverts to the developer. That's
why Nuremberg is losing its social housing much faster than it can
replace it. In 1980 there were 60,000 units. By the year 2000 that
figure will have halved. The fear is that, as richer households move out
to better areas, Nuremberg's carefully designed mixed housing policy
will be undermined and ''areas of shattered glass'' re-emerge.
One of Nuremberg's success stories has been her tourist industry.
Between 1984 and 1992 the number of overnight visitors rose by around
75%, around two-thirds of them generated by business or the big
conventions, such as the toy fair, which dominate the calendar. But
since then numbers have fallen, leaving hotels struggling to fill their
rooms.
Nobody is using crisis terminology in Nuremberg but clearly a city
which has seen itself as a model for others is suddenly facing a major
test of strength. Glasgow's City Vision project is partly based on a
similar exercise carried out in Nuremberg two years ago. Officials, the
business community, learning institutions and others co-operated to draw
up a list of employment and development opportunities based on the
region's strengths and weaknesses.
The result is a six-point plan: the promotion of future-oriented
products; the encouragement of a climate of innovation; the development
of the city as a commercial centre and tourist destination; the
development of the city's ''hub'' status; a series of training
initiatives; and a major marketing campaign. Though a useful priorities
list, much of it remains unfunded.
And some believe it is too little, too late. Gerd Lobodda, local head
of the metalworkers union, argues that Nuremberg should have foreseen
the looming crisis and taken avoiding action several years ago. At that
time he was urging companies to form links to cement Nuremberg's
position as the world leader in public transport production. ''If those
responsible for the city hadn't failed so blatantly over the last 10
years, Nuremberg could have become a European centre of competence.
Vision and imagination to manage the present period of industrial change
are inadequate.''
Lobodda believes few beyond a small group of officials have an
understanding of the problems and there is a reluctance to intervene
because of an over reliance on ''the self-healing forces of the
market.''
At least Nuremberg has a choice. Garman federalism means that key
decisions about how the city will develop are made at a city or regional
level. Housing, waste management, public transport, economic development
and many other aspects of life where the big decisions are made by
central government in Britain are resolved locally here. The future is
in their hands.

efficient advice and support service for businesses large and small,
from start-ups to more established operations.
The new organisation, to be based in the new Conference House in

THE worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria has hit
Paterson Zochonis, the cash-rich manufacturer of Cussons soaps and other
products.
Profits dipped 11% to #25.1m in the year to May, but dividends still
go up 8% to 15p after a final of 12.45p, as the group is confident of a
better first half to the current year.
Operating profits were slightly ahead at #15.9m though the
contribution from associates slipped from #4.73m to #2.34m. The first
half of the year was hit by Nigeria's lack of foreign exchange which
affected imports of raw materials.
The situation became easier in the second half and production returned
to more normal levels, though Paterson said consumers were turning to
lower-priced alternatives as their purchasing power declined.
Sales in the current year are being maintained despite a Government
stabilisation programme which is expected to have a dampening effect on
consumer spending. The exchange rate has been steady for six months.
Revaluation of Nigerian assets at the free market exchange rate has led
to a deficit of #12.2m which has been taken through reserves.
The subsidiary in Ghana is trading better and a new factory is to be
built. The group is expanding in South-east Asia with the Cussons and
Imperial Leather brands and initial trading is reportedly going well.
In Europe, additions to the Imperial Leather range were launched in
the UK, while a new factory in Greece is under construction to keep pace
with strong sales growth.
Paterson has a developing business in Poland, where Cussons improved
market share, and an acquisition has taken it into skin care and
toiletries.
Paterson's net cash hoard stood at #112m at the year-end and
contributed net interest of #6.8m against #8m. The shares added 3p at
463p.

IBM, which has its European headquarters in Greenock, is continuing to
grab a large slice of the worldwide computing market according to
third-quarter results announced yesterday.
Last night Dave Horton, personnel and location services manager at the
Greenock plant, welcomed the results and Greenock's contribution towards
them.
He said: ''These results are very positive, underlining IBM's
continuing growth and success in a competitive industry.''
For the three months ended September the company earnings were #826m
before exceptionals, compared with #451m for the same quarter last year.
But the company's bottom line loss for the quarter was #342m after a
#1.114m charge associated with the take over of the Lotus Development
Corp.
Mr. Horton added: ''Recent visits and commcents from the chairman
confirm Greenock's position as a key site to IBM.
''Our contribution to these results has been good, and we are
confident that our continuing focus on the needs of our customers and
dealers will lead to even more significant contributions in trhe coming
months.''
Revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which all come under
the Greenock umbrella were in excess of #3.5m, a 6% increase on the same
period last year.
Announcing the results yesterday Mr. Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief
executive officer of IBM, said hardware sales had been disappointing.
''However'', he added ''it's encouraging, given the breadth of our
product line, we were able to report good results overall''

SCOTTISH companies are decidedly more optimistic about their prospects
for the next year than the rest of their British counterparts. About 41%
are looking for growth compared with 39% three months ago.
That compares with a UK average of just 21% which is down on the 33%
seen in March and 57% in September 1994.
The fourth SBC Warburg Survey ''A View from the Boardroom'', conducted
by Mori in September, was based on questionnaires sent to more than 1000
companies with a market capitalisation of under #320m -- around 35%
replied.
SBC Warburg's Richard Hickinbotham said the figures pointed to the
smaller companies being less confident and that they herald a tighter
climate ahead.
A net one in 10 firms intend to reduce their workforce compared with
one in seven in February which were considering recruiting.
The biggest setback has been among the general industrial companies of
which 25% are in some way linked to housebuilding. They are expecting
more difficult conditions to win orders, with a decline from 36% to 12%
in optimism about one-year growth prospects.
In contrast, the consumer sector is looking a little more sprightly
with 37% expecting growth compared with 22% in February but from a very
low base. Gross margins declined drastically in the quarter to September
after the hot summer. Some recovery is now expected.
In recent times the Scottish situation was never as dire as that in
England and Wales, with 31% expecting to raise their selling prices
compared with 12% nationally and 56% seeking to increase output (42%).
While small company earnings are expected to rise 17.5% in 1995
compared with 10% for the general market, they will not increase by such
amounts in 1996 and possibly 1997.

Detroit, Tuesday -- General Motors Corporation today reported
stronger-than-expected results for the third quarter, with an improved
performance in its US automotive operation boosting overall profits to
$642m for the period.
Wall Street analysts had expected GM to report earnings of $450m to
$500m for the quarter, below the $552m earned in the 1994 period.
The company's key US operation trimmed its loss to $93m from $363m in
last year's third quarter, as it increased its share of the North
American automotive market to 32.2% from 31.5%. Total revenues climbed
to $37.46bn from $34.51bn a year ago.
''Due to the seasonal nature of our business, third-quarter results
are generally lower than the first two quarters, but we're certainly
pleased with our performance in the third quarter . . . because it
demonstrates that we continue to move in the right direction,'' GM chief
executive officer and president John Smith said.
The company's international operations contributed net income of
$111m, against $232m a year ago.
GM's automotive operations in Europe reported a net loss of $98m in
the quarter, compared with a loss of $14m in the same period of 1994.
For the remainder of GM's International Operations, including Latin
American Operations and Asia-Pacific Operations, net income totalled
$209m, down from $246m in the prior-year period.
Mr Smith also cited the strong performance of GM's Delphi Automotive
Systems unit. Delphi's sales outside the North American vehicle sector
accounted for 31.5% of its sales in the quarter.
GM's Electronic Data Systems unit contributed record quarterly
earnings of $246m in the quarter, compared with income of $216m in the
same period last year.
On Monday, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the finance arm of
GM, reported a rise in third-quarter net income to $254m from $245m a
year earlier.
* US CAR giant Ford Motor Company said today it would invest #340m at
its Bridgend engine factory in South Wales, doubling production and
creating 480 jobs there.
As many as 1000 jobs may be created as the ''ripple effect'' generates
further work for component makers and suppliers and the investment takes
Ford's commitment to British operations this year well past the
billion-dollar mark.

BRITAIN'S sole surviving linoleum maker, Forbo-Nairn, yesterday
unveiled a #15m investment programme to boost capacity at its plant in
Kirkcaldy, Fife, where the floor covering has been produced without
interruption for more than a century.
The injection, which will be implemented over a three-year period,
includes #6m to provide a polymerisation facility on the site and will
result in 14 new jobs.
It comes after a decade which has seen a notable re-emergence of
linoleum in the floor covering market worldwide and a 33% rise in
Forbo-Nairn's production in the past year.
Announcing the move, managing director Alan Lawson described it as
Forbo-Nairn's largest-ever investment in its Marmoleum range of
linoleum, the group's main branded product.
''We are alone among British manufacturers to have kept faith in
linoleum's future,'' he said, predicting that the product would remain
successful in the floor coverings market into next century.
''We have no doubts about its strong future in British and overseas
markets,'' he added.
The Kirkcaldy factory, which has a workforce of 450, is part of the
Swiss-based Forbo group, a world leader in floor coverings, including
cushioned vinyls, contact vinyls and carpets. It was acquired from
Unilever about 10 years ago.
Linoleum production for the household market dipped dramatically in
the sixties and seventies because of changing tastes, including the
trend for wall-to-wall carpets, but demand for it has continued to
flourish in the commercial and public sectors.
''Linoleum is a superb concept,'' Mr Lawson said. ''It is produced
from sustainable materials that are not based on oil derivatives. It is
made predominantly from natural raw materials and has a long life,
considerable beauty and comes at an economic market price.''
Forbo is one of Europe's top 500 companies. Employee numbers have
trebled to more than 9000 in various centres throughout the world and
sales have increased over the period from #300m to #1000m a year.

TO cut or not to cut taxes is the key question facing Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke as he prepares for next month's Budget.
The fact that he is a politician first and a Chancellor second
suggests that given the proximity of the General Election and the
continuing lack of a ''feel good'' factor among the general public as a
whole, taxes will be cut.
Direct rather than indirect taxation is likely to be the target for
any reductions. It is seven-and-a-half years since the last reduction in
the basic rate of income tax.
It appears that there is room for such cuts to be made without a
detrimental effect on the economy.
The influential Institute for Fiscal Studies/Goldman Sachs Green
Budget, published recently, suggests that up to #3000m of tax cuts could
be made. These could be funded by a combination of small reductions in
planned real levels of public spending, small increases in other taxes,
and some slight increase in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
(PSBR) -- the difference between state spending and income.
The main choice on income tax is between the basic rate and
allowances. A total of #3000m buys 1.5% off the basic rate taking it
down from 25% to 23.5%, provides an extra #3050 allowance to the 20% tax
band taking it to #6250, or it could increase all tax thresholds by
#450. The extension of the personal allowance provides the greatest
boost to those on the lowest incomes but is less headline grabbing than
a cut in the basic rate.
For #3300m, more dramatic action could be taken in the form of an
increase in the 20% tax band width to #11,255 and a restriction in
personal allowances to 20%. This would enable the Chancellor to declare
that the basic rate is now 20% since the majority of taxpayers would
only pay this rate of tax.
One tax which has rarely been out of the news in recent months is the
windfall tax. This was first proposed by Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown
as a means of clawing back some of what are perceived by many to be the
excessive profits of the privatised utilities.
While such a tax undoubtedly has popular appeal among the general
public and some MPs, the IFS believes that such a tax would be hard to
defend because it could only be levied on current shareholders. In
addition, it is thought unlikely to curb any abuse of monopoly power.
A more attractive option for the Government is felt to be rebates to
consumers. This would have the combined benefits of reducing our bills
and lowering the retail price index. Such a course of action could be
effected through the industry regulators.
Family taxation, the housing market and profit-related pay are also
thought likely to attract the Chancellor's attention. In addition, the
IFS predicts that inheritance tax may be eased and that there will
almost certainly be reform of long-term care.
This last issue has quite rightly been causing a lot of concern
because the high cost of private residential nursing care and
financially challenged local authority social services departments have
meant many elderly people have had to sell their homes to fund their
care.
There are some in the City who are already starting to worry that Mr
Clarke will make unwise tax cuts in next month's Budget. By the end of
this week there should be a clearer picture of the extent to which the
economy is slowing down.
Data on the PSBR, retail sales, unemployment and average earnings
figures, money supply and the latest quarterly survey from the British
Chambers of Commerce will undoubtedly be closely scrutinised in both
Whitehall and the City.
Whatever the hype about tax cuts they are unlikely to be of a scale
sufficient to compensate for more than a fraction of last year's tax
increases. We have all got used to and expect a certain basic level of
service in areas such as the NHS and education, services which are
becoming increasingly costly to provide given the growth in technology
and rising expectations.
These extra funds can only be found from taxation so unless there is
to be significant scaling up of the privatisation programme, the scope
for tax cuts is not that great.

TRADITIONALISTS love it. The way the game should be played, they
insist. Be a jolly good thing if more tournaments were staged along
these lines.
But for the rest of us, we who have tramped along the Burma Road at
Wentworth, mainly while sitting in our armchairs, for the last 34 years,
would it not be more honest to admit that the World Matchplay Golf
Championship has become, dare one say it, a wee bit boring?
Ernie Els and Steve Elkington are lovely lads. They even play their
golf at a decent pace, but the final on Sunday hardly set the pulses
racing.
Maybe young Els is the finest match player in the world, though
without Greg Norman, Nick Faldo or John Daly in the field it is hard to
sustain that contention. And compared to the kind of tension the players
had to endure during the Ryder Cup the Wentworth event is but a stroll
in the woods.
The tournament has always been Mark McCormack's baby. His IMG
organisation -- and you had better believe it -- issues the invitations.
If you are not a client of his company -- or even worse, if you are an
ex-client -- then the gold-embossed card might well be posted
second-class, or not at all.
Mind you, the IMG knockers should reflect that without this
organisation it is doubful whether the tournament would have lasted so
long.
Once upon a time, when Nicklaus, Palmer and Player ruled the world,
and McCormack them, coming to Wentworth was almost like playing in an
extra major. There have indeed been many memorable matches, not least
the epic duel when Player came back from the brink to defeat Tony Lema.
All the participants in the championship were pampered -- bring along
your families and we will put you up in some of Surrey's finest
mansions, maids and all. Nowadays the players own the mansions, employ
the maids full-time. Sam Torrance and Colin Montgomerie can walk home
from the course.
The money is still good. You can collect #30,000 for losing in the
first round. Trouble is, most of the top Americans can earn that sort of
dough for a pro-am or a clinic and they are not keen to experience yet
another dose of jet-lag.
In the US this tournament rates zilch coverage, considerably less than
college football. World reputations are not made or broken on
Wentworth's links.
But the BBC has been an ever-present, the golden tones of Peter and
Alex, the genuine world champions of golf commentary, have perhaps given
the event a status it no longer deserves. For in truth, this is not a
tournament which any satellite station would wish to screen . . . ''Run
this by me again, Walt -- the matches are over 36 holes and they can
finish at the twelfth or thirteenth hole? What the hell do we show after
that?''
Surely, before the championship loses all its prestige and the crowds
drift away -- as they are beginning to -- it is time for a new format.
Maybe even now some bright kid in IMG is going to impress Mr McCormack
by coming up with one.
Allow me a few suggestions. If one can assemble 16 of the world's best
players -- and that does not seem impossible -- we might start by
guaranteeing them at least three days' work.
Four pools of four, each man playing the other over 18 holes on the
kind of strokeplay/matchplay format used in the Dunhill Cup, could
present us with two cracking semi-finals. They should also be over one
round with the final on the same day.
I have another idea to profer. Why not stage two matchplay
championships at the same time? For years I have been hearing what a
pity it is that women's professional golf does not receive the coverage
it deserves.
Fine. Let's put Laura Davies and co. on with the big boys, alternate
matches, everyone on the telly at once. Would that not be a big boost
for the women's game? Why, off their own tees, you could even match the
men's champion against his female counterpart and produce a very
interesting duel.
Steady on, old man, that's going a bit far, be lettin' them in to the
damned clubhouse next. All right, I take the last bit back, but none of
the rest. The Matchplay is a tired tournament in need of a shake-up and
it should be done soon.
Don't bother to slip the cheque into the press tent at St Andrews,
Mark. Dinner at the Old Course Hotel will be fine.

CRICKET
MIKE Allingham completed his remarkable return to the big time last
night when he was named Scottish cricket's Batsman of the Year.
The Heriot's all-rounder defied medical odds when he fought back from
career-threatening knee and back injuries to star in the Goldenacre
side's championship-winning side last season.
Before injury struck two seasons ago, ''Allers'' was a regular in the
Scotland side and tipped as a future national captain. But serious
knee-ligament damage and continual back problems had him on the verge of
quitting the game just 18 months ago.
Amazingly, he averaged 132.5 in Edinburgh's triumphant Quaich side and
managed to force his way back into the international scene to face the
West Indies.
National coach Jim Love said: ''Allers has shown tremendous dedication
in fighting back, and he deserves his reward.''
Strathmore paceman Kevin Thomson scooped the bowling award, with
Uddingston's George Reifer taking the honours for best all-rounder.
As expected, Progress Software Clydesdale walked off with the Famous
Grouse Team of the Year award.
SCOTTISH cricket chiefs are to disappoint the country's Muslim
community by playing next year's glamour friendly against Pakistan in
Edinburgh.
The game had been expected to go to Clydesdale's Titwood ground, which
lies in the heart of Scotland's largest Pakistani community on the South
Side of Glasgow.
But SCU officials will tonight agree to stage the game at the Grange
club in Edinburgh, where the West Indies attracted a capacity crowd last
season.
SCU general manager Alex Ritchie yesterday refused to confirm the
venue but said: ''There are a lot of things to be considered in deciding
where big games should be played. The likely size of crowd is one. But
so is the state of the wicket.''
The Titwood pitch came under fire this season after ground staff had a
series of problems with the wicket.
But a Clydesdale insider argued: ''We've spent #2000 on repairing the
pitch in the last two months. It seems the SCU have jumped the gun
without giving us the chance to put our house in order.''

LAST month's public sector borrowing requirment was more or less in
line with market projections, perhaps a shade lower.
It does not alter the perception in the City that the Treasury's
summer forecast of #23.6bn for the current financial year is likely to
prove well short of the eventual outcome. That figure itself was revised
upward and a further revision by the Treasury seems likely.
The main problem area remains a shortfall in the growth in receipts.
In the year to September, central Government receipts were 7.4% higher
than in the same period last year. The Treasury summer forecast assumed
there would be growth in receipts for the financial year as a whole of
10.8%. The slower growth to date represents almost #8000m in lower
receipts.
Analysts say that there needs to be a significant pick-up in the
growth rate for the PSBR, excluding privatisation proceeds, to show any
improvement from 1994-95. However, some of the shortfall is likely to be
recouped as receipts growth recovers and the direst predictions for the
PSBR could be overdone.
The figures, anyway, have not dented the widespread view that the
Chancellor is lining up tax cuts of up to #3000m in the Budget, though
it is also felt that these should concentrate on business and that any
personal tax reductions must be offset by cuts in public expenditure. An
overtly political Budget could well backfire, not least because of its
impact on financial markets.

THE report by the Singapore authorities on the collapse of Barings
complements the inquiry by the Board of Banking Supervision in London
but does not contain startling new revelations.
However, the authorities were clearly puzzled why alarm bells at the
Bank of England, in its role as supervisor of the banks, did not sound
in time for action to have been taken that might have saved Barings. The
worry all along has been that the controls are not adequate or not
enforced with sufficient rigour and this report only increases this
concern.
The Bank has not been very explicit about the changes it has made
since the collapse though there was a series of detailed recommendations
in the Board of Banking Supervision's report. There must be a suspicion
that complacency has not been rooted out from the Bank's culture.
The rather informal behind-the-scenes way in which the Bank works has
advantages in terms of flexibility and market stability, but it needs to
be constantly on watch to ensure it maintains the necessary rigour,
which does not appear to have been the case for Barings.
There can never be a fool-proof method of supervision, particularly if
traders are determined to conceal what they are doing. However, it is
vital that controls are as tight as possible because of the sheer scale
of potential derivatives disasters and the threat they could pose to
global financial stability.
Labour's City spokesman, Alistair Darling, said the party is examining
whether the Bank's supervisory role should be separated out into a new
body. But this would be no guarantee of greater rigour. A rigid
regulatory separation between a bank's securities operations and its
core banking activities would be more useful. Under this system
unusually large transfers from the core activities to the securities
side would be more visible.

SQUASH
AFTER a relatively disappointing start to the season, Peter Nicol,
Scotland's world No.4, got the boost he wanted before next month's World
Open with victory in the Canadian Open.
The 22-year-old Scottish champion, who was the No.1 seed, cruised
through the opening rounds before beating young Canadian Jonathan Power
by 3-1 in the final in Toronto.
However, he will need to beat defending champion, Jansher Khan, if he
is to improve on last year's performance of a semi-final place in the
World Open in Cyprus in three weeks' time.
Meanwhile, Scotland's weakened side of Alasdair Taylor, Dave Gordon,
Barry Sutherland, and Alan Thomson have been drawn to meet Canada,
Ireland, and Austria in the World Team Championships in Egypt next
month.
With Nicol and Scottish No.2 Martin Heath both unavailable, Scotland
will struggle to stay in the elite top 16, but just one section victory
would be enough.

RUGBY LEAGUE
SCOTLAND'S World Cup hopefuls have been warned to beware of a skinhead
called ''Sergeant Slaughter'' -- giant loose forward Jeff Preston, who
leads the USA attack in tonight's showdown at Northampton.
The Scots got off to a flier in the Emerging Nations tourney on Monday
by beating Russia 35-9 in the Featherstone double-header after the USA
had been dumped 64-6 by Cook Islands.
But ex-Marine Preston, who scored the Americans' only try against the
South Sea magicians, warned: ''We are much better than that result
shows. It was the biggest match in our history, and we all just froze
when it mattered. I can promise that it won't happen again.''
Scotland chiefs will delay their selection until this morning, when a
few bumps and bruises should have cleared up.
Winger Ally Blee was frustrated, despite being named man-of-the-match
for his two-try haul. He claimed: ''Obviously it was great to win and
get on the scoresheet, but I should have had four.'' He had two
touchdowns disallowed.

DUNHILL CUP
YET another star will today join the St Andrews firmament. In the
pro-am competition preceding the Alfred Dunhill Cup, which begins
tomorrow, and starting at 12.40pm Ernie Els, trailing clouds of glory
from Wentworth, partners his father Neels, Scotland's former rugby
captain, Gavin Hastings -- and Rocky himself, aka Sylvester Stallone.
Stallone, who is taking a break from filming in Rome, has been playing
golf for three years but already claims a handicap of 12 at his home
club, Lakeside, in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank. But this was not
his first experience of the Old Course, for he played it only a
fortnight after having taken up the game.
''I embarrassed myself then,'' he said after completing a practice
round yesterday with Els, Johann Rupert, chairman of the sponsor's
holding company, and David Frost, whose brother Sam has been coaching
Stallone. This will be the actor's first pro-am, but despite winds
gusting to 40mph he evidently played well. ''I won Dunhill, the whole
company,'' Stallone claimed.
Meanwhile, a date earlier than mid-October is being sought not only by
the sponsors but by the players, whose opinions also have been
canvassed. A complicating factor of this occasion is that clocks will be
put back an hour this weekend, sooner than is usual.
Peter German, the tournament administrator, said: ''We are aware of
potential weather problems at this time of year. We would prefer to hold
the event earlier in October or the end of September, and the players
wouldn't mind competing not having to wear woollen hats and thermal
underwear.''
Discussions will take place this week and a decision is expected by
Sunday on whether the tournament, whose three-year contract now expires,
will continue. German said: ''There is every indication it will go on
and at St Andrews, which is so much a part of the event, itself suited
to the course.''
Andrew Coltart, who with Sam Torrance and Colin Montgomerie forms
Scotland's team, echoed that opinion. Inspired by the atmosphere, he
said lyrically: ''Golf oozes from the very stones of the buildings.''

THE Wee Rovers from Fife slid down the Easter Road slope to reality as
the German league leaders clinically destroyed the dreams that, maybe
foolishly but understandably, had been nurtured by fans starved of the
chance to see their favourites at the top table.
More accurately, it was the undiminished hunger of Jurgen Klinsmann,
who scored both Bayern goals, to put the ball in the net that proved
just too much for a Raith side that did not let anyone down.
In fact, the Fifers pushed and hurried and worried the Germans with
great verve for most of the evening, backed by most of the 12,818
enthusiastic supporters, but did not quite have the savvy to translate
their good build-up and energetic running into goals.
Many a lesser team would have conceded defeat after having lost a
goal, well taken by Klinsmann, but also the consequence of a lapse of
defensive concentration, before six minutes had gone. The Rovers were
not for quitting, however, and time and again caused unseemly panic in
the German defence, although only occasionally creating serious chances.
The great adventure will be completed in the Olympic Stadium in two
weeks. No joy of the Rovers this time, but they did give it their very
best shot.
Manager Jimmy Nicholl said that his men would have a go in the second
leg but confessed that a 1-1 scoreline was what he had hoped would be
the outcome, even after having gone a goal down. ''I enjoyed the game
and that usually means our lads played well. We could get caught by
three or four over there, but we still have a slight chance.''
Klinsmann, as ever, made the proper comments to go with his two-goal
performance. ''I thought Raith Rovers gave everything they could. We
expected a tough game and we got that. Our keeper had an incredible save
and that may have changed the game.''
To their credit, the Fife fans were in great form all night, from
their spirited rendition of ''We'll Take The High Road'' onwards, but
Nicholl's plan, which was, indeed, to take the high road into the Bayern
penalty area had not even had a chance to get going before these
dastardly Germans had punctured the first ambition -- not to lose a
goal.
The bookies had been offering 7-2 against the man himself scoring the
opening goal and maybe we will not get a better bet this year.
Inevitably, the Klinsmann foot was the one that mattered.
There seemed nothing much on when Scholl gave the ball to Herzog on
the left but when he chipped it into space between Dennis and Thomson,
Klinsmann anticipated the pass and nipped around the defender to touch
it over the keeper and into the net. Simple, of course, when you know
how.
That goal doused the fire in Raith hearts for a while but they
gradually regained their will to succeed and went at the Germans with a
great deal of energy and determination. Even so, the breakaway thrusts
of Bayern were inclined to cause greater problems.
The best chance for the Fifers came a minute before the break when a
cross from the right by Dennis reached Graham but his header went
straight to the keeper.
The lurking danger from the quick break was ever present, however, and
one gave Scholl a chance to make it 2-0, but Sinclair cleared his shot
off the line and Thomson dived to pip Klinsmann to the rebound.
Rovers were undeterred as they went into full-attack mode, encouraged
by tremendous noise from their fans.
However, just when the Rovers troops were reaching fever pitch, that
man with the devastating finish, Klinsmann, did it again. This time it
was Sforza who did well on the right before laying the ball back into
his stride and the next moment the ball was tucked safely in the net.
Raith put on two substitutes, Crawford for Dair, and Rougier for
McInally, as they tried to retrieve something to give the travellers to
Germany in a fortnight some hope.
However, it was another sub, Jean Pierre Papin, who drew admiration
with a ferocious shot that hit the bar, and Thomson pulled of a super
save to prevent Klinsmann securing his hat trick.
RAITH ROVERS -- Thomson, Kirkwood , Broddle, Coyle, Dennis, Sinclair,
McInally, Cameron, Graham, Lennon, Dair. Substitutes -- Crawford,
Taylor, Rougier, Fridge, Raeside.
BAYERN MUNICH -- Kahn, Hamann, Liege, Kreuzer, Helmer, Strunz, Scholl,
Herzog, Klinsmann, Sforza, Zickler. Substitutes -- Probut, Frey,
Nerlinger, Witeczek, Papin.
Referee -- R Harrel (France).

ARBROATH chalked up their fourth draw in a row when a late goal denied
them victory.
An Ian Porteous shot struck the junction of bar and post early on but
home pressure was rewarded in 21 minutes when Alan Kennedy headed in

A Steve McCormick goal just after the interval was disallowed for

Auxerre 0, Nottingham Forest 1
STEVE Stone's third goal in three games and a vintage display of
defensive grit had Forest drunk on European power in the heart of
Burgundy country as they put one foot firmly into the third round of the
UEFA Cup.
Stone, England's newest recruit in Oslo last week, took full advantage
of a slip on the greasy surface by Nigerian marker Taribo West to burst
on to a pass by Alf Inge Haaland, a surprise selection in place of
Dutchman Bryan Roy, after 23 minutes to lob stranded keeper Fabien Cool.
It was almost as cheeky as Stone's winner against Tottenham in the
Premiership on Saturday.
But in the end Forest's performance, full of fire and fight against a
determined Auxerre blitz, was almost a carbon copy of Arsenal's in the
same stadium last March in the quarter-finals of the European
Cup-winners' Cup.
As Forest rode their luck, it was winger Ian Woan who became the
unlikely defensive hero, clearing off the line on no fewer than three
occasions, although furious Auxerre players claimed his first rescue
act, from Algerian midfielder Moussa Saiv's fierce cross-shot, came
after the ball had crossed the line.
Twice within seconds during the last five minutes defender Frank
Silvestre banged in goal-bound efforts after moving up front following
the exit of sweeper Laurent Blanc. But Woan first kicked away and then
headed behind for a corner at full stretch to start a party among the
1300 Forest fans.
Forest's night was tarnished by reports of trouble in a bar on the way
to the ground where drunken fans caused damage and clashed with police.

IN the last five working days, about 35 million shares in the Royal
Bank of Scotland have changed hands, equivalent to 4% of the total. Last
night, they closed 9p up on the day at 534p after hitting an all-time
inter-day high of 550p.
Some people think they know something about a possible merger although
the bank puts the market activity down to media speculation and shortage
of stock against the background of the excitement generated by the
proposed Lloyds acquisition of TSB.
One suggestion that the Royal could merge with the Bank of Scotland
would take some believing. Apart from the enormous rationalisation costs
from closing around 300 branches in Scotland, the possibilty of a
monopoly inquiry, and customer and political opposition from almost all
sides, there is the question of the clash of cultures between the two
Edinburgh banks. The half-mile distance between the two head offices is
in some respects the nearest thing they have in common.
The most obvious bidder is HSBC. Its Selkirk-born chairman Sir William
Purves could make a re-run of the takeover bid in the early 1980s when
it was in competition with Standard Chartered.
At first sight, the logic is strong with a good geographic fit in the
branch network although there would be an over-exposure in the Midlands
and Liverpool area with its Midland bank subsidiary.
There is talk of synergy between Midland's First Direct telephone
banking and Royal's Direct Line insurance while Royal's Citizens
Financial Group subsidiary in New England is an asset for which every
other British bank would give its eye teeth.
Sir William has blown hot and cold on further UK expansion but the
Royal could always behave like a regional electricity company and offer
Direct Line to shareholders in exchange for their loyalty.
A slightly more remote possibility is National Westminster, which
seems to lack a decisive policy at present and is perhaps the least
innovative of the High Street banks but should be kept on any list of
contenders. The Royal would satisfy most of its needs.

Leeds 3, PSV Eindhoven 5
TWO late goals from Belgian internationalist Luc Nilis killed off
Leeds' stirring fightback, leaving them with a near-impossible task in
their UEFA Cup second-round return leg against PSV Eindhoven.
Nilis struck twice in the final seven minutes after Howard Wilkinson's
side had fought back from 3-1 down to draw level with a determined
second-half display.
Gary Speed, who was to limp off after 26 minutes, had given Howard
Wilkinson's side just the start they wanted with a glancing header past
keeper Ronald Waterreus from Gary McAllister's free kick in six minutes.
But it took PSV only five minutes to draw level. Nilis, who was left
unmarked on the halfway line for Waterreus' goal kick, controlled the
high ball and ran on into the penalty area. David Wetherall partially
blocked his shot but the ball fell to Rene Eijkelkamp to side-foot home
from five yards.
PSV then grabbed two goals in four minutes, beginning with a touch of
luck, with Dutch internationalist Jonk's wayward shot from the edge of
the box deflecting off Marciano Vink before flying past John Lukic. But
No.3 was stamped with class, this time Nilis flicked the ball in the air
from a free kick and Wim Jonk launched a spectacular volley past Lukic.
But Leeds launched a stirring fightback in the second half. After only
three minutes Tony Yeboah brilliantly picked out Carlton Palmer on the
edge of the box and his drive beat Waterreus.
McAllister brought Leeds level after 72 minutes, calmly lobbing the
ball into an empty net from 35 yards after the Dutch keeper punched away
under pressure.
But the fightback was wrecked by two flashes of brilliance by Nilis in
the final seven minutes. He volleyed superbly past Lukic and, with just
two minutes remaining, he played a one-two with Phillip Cocu on the edge
of the box before sidestepping the advancing Lukic and rolling the ball
into the net.
* LEEDS manager Howard Wilkinson yesterday rejected the chance to
become the English FA's technical director. Wilkinson was widely
reported to have been a strong candidate for the newly created post,
which offers a key role in restructuring the English game over the next
10 years.

Brondby 0, Liverpool 0
GOALKEEPER David James produced the heroics in Copenhagen last night
to keep Liverpool on course for the last 16 of the UEFA Cup.
James made two spectacular second-half saves as Brondby threatened to
snatch the initiative in their second round, first leg clash at the
Parken Stadium.
Liverpool were also indebted to the perfectly-timed tackles of England
defender Mark Wright. Enjoying his best spell for two years after a
succession of injuries had reduced him to a shadow role, Wright superbly
marshalled his side's rearguard action in the absence of the
inspirational Neil Ruddock.
Ruddock was ruled out by suspension after being booked in both first
round matches against Vladikavkaz and his second leg availability,
coupled with home advantage, augers well for the Merseysiders.
Manager Roy Evans decided against the solo striker system he had
successfully employed against the Russians -- and he gave Ian Rush the
second strike role alongside Robbie Fowler. Rush, preferred to #8.5m
British record buy Stan Collymore, who was relegated to the bench, came
close on one occasion while Fowler almost forced a breakthrough after 69
minutes.
But Liverpool, who had been happy to play a containing game, will
recognise the part that James played. He produced a spectacular save on
the hour and then flew to the rescue two minutes from time as Brondby
finished with a flourish.
Later, Liverpool manager Evans admitted he was satisfied with the
goalless draw, but he warned: ''There is no way the tie is over. Brondby
played really well. We had to work very hard to contain them.''
Clearly he did not regard it as a vintage performance by his side,
saying: ''When we had the ball we didn't pass it too well, so we had to
battle hard. But at least the lads were prepared to do that and I will
settle for no-score.''
Brondby coach Ebbe Skovdahl said: ''Liverpool looked satisfied with
the goalless draw, but we know it will be different in the second leg.''
He added: ''It will be like a hurricane and, if we don't get a quick
goal, we know we could be blown away.''

TENNIS
STEFFI Graf, who has lost a sponsorship deal worth more than #675,000
a year after a tax scandal, is not in immediate danger of being dropped
by other backers.
Three of the German star's main sponsors said they had no plans to cut
their ties with the Wimbledon champion, who yesterday lost one of the
biggest deals in German sport, with car firm Adam Opel.
''We advertise with her as a tennis player and nothing has changed
with that,'' said a spokesman for German-based sportswear firm Adidas,
which has worked with Graf since 1984.
Her racket supplier, Wilson, also spoke out in support of Graf, whose
father Peter was jailed in August to stop him fleeing or concealing
evidence that might support allegations that he and his daughter dodged
millions of marks in taxes.
''There are no plans to split with her. In 1994 we decided to work
with Steffi Graf not only as a tennis player but also as a human
being,'' a Wilson official said.
Opel decided not to renew their contract after 10 years because of
concern about the way the 26-year-old multi-millionairess' money was
managed.
The tennis idol, who is currently in England for the Brighton
International tournament, insists she entrusted most of her financial
affairs to her father and advisers from an early stage of her career,
and is unaware of all the details of her huge wealth.
Opel official Hans Wilhelm Gaeb stressed that the firm believed in
Graf's innocence in the affair. ''The decision was very hard. . . Steffi
has concentrated completely on her sporting achievements and, as a
result, she simply does not have the information she needs about her
business,'' Gaeb said.
Elida Gibbs, the company for which Graf does deodorant commercials,
said it also regarded Graf as a victim rather than a culprit in the tax
scandal until her guilt was proved.

'If Juventus play at their normal level -- and with their normal
spirit -- then they have no need to fear any side in Europe'
MARCELLO LIPPI
MARCELLO Lippi dallied over his lunch in one of Turin's more
fashionable restaurants, exuding the appearance of a man absolutely
content with his lot.
The disappointment of defeat against AC Milan three days ago had ebbed
as if a gentle wave of confidence had washed over the Juventus manager,
purging anger and regret at the loss of ground in Serie A.
It was as though Lippi was already convinced his players would redeem
themselves this evening, when they play Rangers in the Champions'
League. Three more points and Juventus would virtually be guaranteed a
place in the quarter-finals, and even though Gianluca Vialli will not
play because of injury, the manager oozed confidence.
After having finished his food he did his best to tell the media that
his respect for Rangers was powerful, but even his very garb suggested
calmness and a total lack of fear.
Dressed in club blazer, a tartan tie and a pair of jeans, Lippi said:
''If Juventus have any problems against Rangers then we will create them
ourselves. I don't wish to be seen to be dismissing Rangers, but I have
to look at this game from our point of view, and also look at the
strengths of my team.
''If Juventus play at their normal level -- and with their normal
spirit -- then they have no need to fear any side in Europe.''
The absence of Vialli, who is considered one of the most influential
players in Italian football, you would imagine would cause some concern,
but Lippi is in the fortunate position of having two more outstanding
strikers in Fabrizio Ravanelli and Alessandro Del Piero. Ravanelli also
was injured last Sunday, but he is expected to play, although his
fitness will be checked this morning.
''I fully expect him to play,'' said Lippi, ''and I'm sure everyone
knows how effective he can be.''
As for Del Piero, his reputation is spreading around Planet Football
at the speed of one of his shots, and Rangers manager Walter Smith
yesterday described the 20-year-old as ''currently the best player in
Europe.''
Del Piero's own manager, however, was reluctant to be as lavish in
praise of the player promoted to the first team when Roberto Baggio was
sold to AC Milan at the end of last season. ''Del Piero is still making
progress and although he is young, he has already scored some
magnificent goals,'' he said. ''He has still to mature and he will
become a much better player yet.''
The Juventus manager said that domestic football commitments prevented
him from watching Rangers personally, but he stressed that he has
watched four videos of them in action. ''I watched their two Champions'
League games against Steaua Bucharest and Borussia Dortmund and I also
watched them play against Celtic and Partick Thistle.
''Perhaps it would have been better had I been able to see them first
hand, but then I didn't watch Steaua or Borussia before we played them
either and we won both of those matches.''
Although unwittingly, Lippi was making it clear that such is the
confidence he has in his own players he feels little need to dwell too
long over the abilities of their opponents. He added that Rangers would
present some difficulties because of the physical nature of their play
and he said he was extremely impressed with their play in the second
half of the game against Borussia a few weeks ago.
''I was especially interested in the way they pressed forward in that
second half, but I think they will be without some of the class and
creativity because of the players they have missing,'' he said.
He was referring, of course, to the absence of Brian Laudrup, Paul
Gascoigne, and Charlie Miller, and it was perhaps significant that Lippi
identified Rangers captain Richard Gough as the player who might cause
Juventus a problem or two. ''He is very dangerous when he goes forward
for free kicks and corner kicks,'' he pointed out.
Having watched Rangers' weekend game against Partick Thistle on video,
Lippi added that ''the speed and determination'' of Durie was
impressive, but he doesn't expect his own defenders to allow Rangers too
much space and time.
Although Ally McCoist did not rate a mention from Lippi the Rangers
striker is relishing the prospect of playing against Juventus. ''I'm
desperate to be on the same field as players like Ravanelli, Deschamps,
and Del Piero,'' said McCoist.
''I know they can cause us a lot of damage, but they are such great
players I am looking forward to the experience. I also know few people
give us any chance and I suppose it's a bit like Raith Rovers and Bayern
Munich.
''However, the feeling in the dressing room is that we can do
something here in Turin, and against Borussia Dortmund we showed we can
battle and play for one another, but we simply cannot afford another
experience like the one we had in Bucharest. We have got to be seen as
an attacking force, because if we sit back we will lose.''
Naturally, McCoist would love to score against an Italian defence and
he pointed out that even though Juventus's defensive system is
impressive they don't have anyone like Borussia's Jurgen Kohler. ''He
has to be the best man-marker in the game right now,'' McCoist said.
Smith may play with three players up front -- McCoist, Durie, who may
be required to shuttle up and down the wide areas, and Oleg Salenko. The
Russian was able to train in the Stadio Delle Alpi last night, although
he will have to be checked again this morning.
A crowd of 45,000 -- 3800 of them Rangers supporters -- is expected in
the stadium which seats 64,000, and most of them will be expecting the
Italians to win.
''I suppose most people are thinking that way, but we will still have
to play our best,'' said Lippi, ''because Rangers will be trying to take
at least a point here and then win when we play in Glasgow.''

THE storm over the unrestrained sale of match tickets to Celtic
supporters in Paris grew last night.
In the city, just off the Champs Elysees, I bought a #40 ticket for an
area which is not far removed from the fans who cause the most trouble
to Paris St Germain.
The ticket was purchased in the FNAC record shop, a major outlet for
the sale of briefs for the match across Paris.
The salesman knew I was British but gave me a choice of seat, a choice
of price, and a choice of area in the Parc des Princes.
Celtic have been told by their French opponents in this potentially
explosive European Cup-winners' Cup tie that they have been monitoring
sales, but that is not true, as I found out.
To add to Celtic's worries, I also learned that fans without tickets
will fly into the French capital today and tomorrow from England and
from the Channel Islands as well as Scotland, all looking to buy tickets
when they arrive.
I believe that Celtic, who have tried hard to control the sale of the
3400 tickets they were allotted, may hand evidence over to UEFA in the
event of trouble.
The French side, whose hooligan element is notorious throughout the
country, are readying themselves for major incidents and 2000 riot
police will be on duty around the stadium.
There is still no indication as to where Celtic fans who have bought
tickets for areas of the ground not allocated to the Glasgow club will
be housed, or even if they will be allowed into the game.
One PSG insider warned: ''There are a lot of crazy people who stand in
one section of our stadium. Anyone who goes there wearing green, or even
speaking English, will be targeted.
''Cars with British number plates are liable to be wrecked if they are
parked anywhere near stadium. It is not a situation where fans should
mix together.''
Unhappily, of course, because of the selling arrangements made by the
French club that is what is liable to happen.
Celtic accepted an allocation of 3400 tickets but estimates among the
fans themselves, and at Parkhead, fear that the number could be in
excess of 5000.
All the club can do is warn their fans not to buy tickets -- and that
is likely to fall on deaf ears.
Alternatively, they can stress to UEFA that the Paris club have sold
tickets indiscriminately. That would seem to be the most potent action
they can take in a situation which is fraught with danger.
Adding to the problems is the mood of the lunatic fringe of PSG
supporters. Their team have not won for three games and they rioted in
Lyon on Saturday night.
Their coach Louis Fernandez said yesterday: ''We need the support of
our fans. The public in Paris must get behind us.
''That is the only way that we can get out of this current slump.
''A convincing victory against Celtic would give us a lift.
''My assistant, Joel Bats, has seen Celtic and told me that they're
not a team who play in a typically British manner.
''They are more controlled, and like to play a passing game instead of
chasing the long ball. It will be a tough game for us.''
His troubled player Patrice Loko, who has suffered mental
disturbances, will start the game against Celtic but defender Bruno
N'Gotty, signed from Lyon in the summer, will not face the Scots.
Yesterday, the reason given was that the defender had been injured at
the weekend. But he was barracked by the PSG fans in the 0-0 draw
against his former side.
Celtic, of course, have their own injury problems but they seem to be
clearing.
Phil O'Donnell looks certain to play after having turned out for the
reserves in midweek, and while Tosh McKinlay and Simon Donnelly have
knocks, both are likely to be on duty, although Jamie McQuilken, who has
done well in recent first-team outings, could play if McKinlay fails to
make it.
''Phil has every chance of playing because this is a game where I feel
his style could be to our advantage.
''The Scottish people are aggressive by nature and like their football
of the raw meat variety but too often in the past we have been found out
in Europe.
''I am trying to get my players to see the game in terms of the full
pitch and to get a better understanding of the game.
''They are beginning to play the way I want and as time goes on will
get better at it while we are working at getting a cutting edge.
''We are keeping good possession of the ball and I don't think we will
change from that too much because that is a quality which is vital in
Europe where teams can break quickly if you lose possession.
''We are under no illusions that PSG will be a good side because they
have a lot of quality players although I believe they are not perfect
and can make mistakes.
''We will go there trying to score a goal because it's very important
in Europe that you take something from the away tie.''
''I won't worry too much if I have to throw in some of my young
players. I have been doing that this season and they have come through
the tests.
''I played in Europe when I was just 20 and I have no worries about
any of the players in my squad and their ability to handle the job.''

PGA QUALIFYING
ALAN Saddington posted a six-under-par 66 at the Peralada European
Tour Pre-qualifying school in Spain yesterday, heading the field by a
shot.
The Germany-based Scot was not far ahead of former Scottish
professional champion Ian Young of Braid Hills, who carded a 69 to share
third spot, with only 11 places up for grabs.
East Kilbride's Craig Ronald, Kings Links assistant Scott Henderson,
and David James all featured close to the top at Peralada with rounds of
70.
Former Walker Cup player and a regular on the Challenge Tour last
year, Longniddry's Raymond Russell, featured at the Emporda school with
a three-under-par 68. Sharing fourth place, he fared better than another
Walker Cup star Stephen Gallacher of Bathgate, who posted a 72 alongside
fellow amateur and Scottish internationalist Craig Hislop to sit well
down the first-round leaderboard. Leading scores:

THE director responsible for the Burger King chain, which was recently
criticised for paying some of its Glasgow staff as little as #1 an hour,
is to receive a payoff totalling nearly #1m, the Grand Metropolitan
parent group announced yesterday.
It said David Nash would receive a #790,000 compensation payment,
which would include his salary and pension benefits, in accordance with
his two-year contract.
On top of that, he would also be paid his normal annual bonus for the
year to the end of September, which would probably be in excess of
#100,000, although the exact figure had not yet been set. A spokesman
said the bonus would be ''based on his excellent performance for the
year''.
Labour employment spokesman Ian McCartney immediately drew attention
to the company's ''double standards'' with ''peasant wages for staff and
mega payments at the top''.
''A company that said it could not afford to pay a living wage to
thousands of young workers was now falling over itself to create a
millionaire redundancy for a director,'' said Mr McCartney, adding that
#900,000 could have created 1000 jobs.
The payoff showed the difference between the boardroom and the burger
bar where staff would need to work for 147 years to match Mr Nash's
windfall, he said.
Mr Nash, who joined GrandMet in 1989 as finance director and became
chairman and chief executive of its food sector in 1993, resigned
following a major restructuring of the company's food business. Although
no longer a director, he will stay on until the end of January to help
with the changes.

FOOD AND DRINK
GEORGE Bull has emerged from the power battle at food and drink giant
Grand Metropolitan as chairman elect to succeed Lord Sheppard on March 1
next year.
While that comes as no great surprise, John McGrath who heads the
all-important IDV spirits division becomes chief executive with David
Nash, the vanquished contender, resigning with immediate effect from the
board and as chairman of the foods division, which includes the high
profile Haagen-Dazs ice-cream.
Mr Bull is credited with building IDV into the world's largest spirits
company. In 1993-94 it brought in #520m of the group's #1068m operating
profits. He in turn is being succeeded by Paul Walsh, currently in
charge of the Pillsbury foods business.
Mr Nash, who was finance director of Cadbury Schweppes before joining
GrandMet in that role in 1989, will receive a payoff of almost #1m. That
comprises #790,000 compensation for his two-year contract and a bonus
reflecting his performance in the foods division. That amounted to
#109,200 in 1994 and is expected to be somewhat larger for the year that
ended in September.
It is suggested that Mr McGrath's more hands-on style of management
was an influential factor in the choice, as Mr Nash is very much a
believer in the pyramid style -- eight jobs in the food sector structure
are being eliminated.
Mr Bull outfought Dundee-born Ian Martin for the position of chief
executive in late 1993 -- Mr Martin then resigned to set-up Glenisla
with financial backing from KKR, the Wall Street leveraged buy-out
specialist.
There have been persistent rumours in recent weeks that Mr Martin may
try to launch a takeover bid to break-up GrandMet into its constituent
parts, which would appear from the outside to be a comparatively simple
task and lead to higher shareholder value.
A source close to GrandMet said the Bull appointment was the right one
and that he would prove a better chairman than chief executive. His
''old-fashioned'' approach is thought to make him better suited to the
role than to a position in the frontline.
In time the Sheppard departure will be well received by the City as
there has been a long-term concern that he was seen as a churner of
assets. That led to speculation over the past year or so that the Burger
King fast-food subsidiary could be sold, although that has been denied.
GrandMet shares eased 6p to 451p.

BRYAN Robson is banking on Brazilian midfielder Juninho to make as big
an impact on the English game as Eric Cantona.
The ambitious Middlesbrough player-manager paraded his #4.75m signing
from Sao Paulo in front of an ecstatic audience at the Riverside Stadium
yesterday and said: ''Eric Cantona has taken Manchester United to a
different level. I hope Juninho will do the same for us.''
It was carnival time on Teesside as more than 4000 'Boro fans packed
into the stadium to greet the 22-year-old Brazilian internationalist. A
50-piece samba band was assembled by the Cleveland College of Performing
Arts, but the weather was distinctly English -- cold and damp.
Juninho, who was accompanied by his father Oswaldo and mother Lucia,
was given a rousing cheer when he finally emerged from the players'
tunnel with Robson.
Speaking through an interpreter, Juninho told a media gathering of
more than 100 that he was overwhelmed by the response of the crowd. He
said: ''The reception was magnificent. I wasn't expecting anything like
this.
''Juninho is not really the only person in Middlesbrough football
club. It's to do with the whole team.''
Robson was clearly moved by the occasion. He said: ''When I look
around this room, I can see what charisma Juninho brings to the game.
''People talk about him settling in, but he is a tough character and
wants to be the best in the world. As far as I'm concerned, those are
the types I want at this football club.
''My players relish him coming and he believes the Premier League
could be the strongest in the world, with players like Gullit and
Bergkamp already here.
''I believe we can compete with the Italians on the commercial side.
The best players in the world want to come to this country. Juninho also
feels that the way my team play will suit his game.''
Robson believes that Juninho will be able to withstand the physical
demands of the Premiership, despite his slight stature. ''When I saw Sao
Paulo play, a beast of a man was marking him and getting away with
murder. He is a tough competitor,'' he said.
''He is still young and still learning. I wouldn't have paid that sort
of money if I didn't believe he could become one of the best players in
the world.''
Juninho will fly back to Brazil today with his family to wait for his
work permit to come through. The formalities are expected to be tidied
up next week and he could make his debut on Saturday week against
Cantona and Manchester United.
But 'Boro fans may have to be content to listening to radio reports of
his debut -- as away fans are locked out of Old Trafford because of
rebuilding work.
Meanwhile, the FA yesterday cleared Middlesbrough of any alleged
irregularities in the transfer of Juninho. The FA had contacted the club
requesting ''clarification'' over the deal, following allegations that
an unlicensed agent was involved.
The query centred around the role of Gianni Paladini, who accompanied
Robson on his journey to Brazil, where the deal was struck with
Juninho's former club, Sao Paulo.
However, FA spokesman Steve Double said yesterday: ''The club have now
come back to us, explaining that Bryan Robson does not speak Portuguese
and Mr Paladini acted purely as an interpreter. We have accepted their
explanation and the matter is now closed.''

WALK-OUT defenceman Paul Hand last night looked set to sign for
Paisley Pirates.
The Scottish internationalit has also been offered terms by first
division pace-setters Dumfries Vikings after Fife Flyers refused to meet
his demand for a #150 a week wage rise.
Pirates coach Martin Shields said: ''Paul watched our win over Telford
Tigers on Sunday and liked what he saw. He's also been talking to
Dumfries Vikings, but is worried about the travelling and we're
confident of getting our man.''
Shields added: ''We need a tough defenceman to really mount a
challenge for the title and Paul is certainly in that category.''
If Flyers agree to release Hand then he should make his debut for
Pirates, who are currently second in the first division, at Bracknell
Bees on Saturday.

THE Scottish arm of Sheffield-based Henry Boot, which yesterday
announced pre-tax profits of #2.7m for the half-year, is continuing to
win contracts north of the Border despite the depressed state of the
construction industry, writes LACHIE KENNEDY.
Already this year it has picked up several multi-million pound
contracts spreading the work for its 600-strong Scots workforce from
Ayrshire in the west to Fife in the east.
The group is buying land for future use, possibly for housing, when
the recession finally comes to an end.
Last weekend it opened a 63-house estate at Livingston in West Lothian
where it will build two and three-bedroomed semi-detached and three and
four-bedroomed detached homes. The first residents are expected to move
in early next year.
The company is also engaged in a #1.8m housing development at
Croftfoot to build three and four-bedroomed homes for Glasgow District
Council and recently started work on a #8m refurbishment of Crosshouse
Hospital, Kilmarnock, which will take almost three years to complete.
Other contracts include a #20.5m water treatment plant at Carron
Valley, near Falkirk, and a #6m distribution centre for an English dog
food group at Cambuslang. It is also working on the #8.5m renovation of
an office block in George Square, Glasgow, a #2.7m refurbishment of
high-rise flats in Pollok, and a #1.5m drainage system at Anstruther in
Fife.
Yesterday's six-month figures, to June this year, show profit rose to
#2.71m from #2.57m for the same period last year on higher turnover of
#86.7m, up #14.6m. That is a 20% increase from last year's #72.07m.
After-tax profit is expected to be #1.86m compared with #1.77m -- an
increase in earnings per share of 3%.
But despite the improvements in the company's fortunes it can be as
much as #1m short each month because of delayed payments from clients,
some of them in Scotland.
Group managing director Jamie Boot said: ''Late payment is a problem
we have to live with and is something that can affect the company.
''At any given time we can be around #1m down because of this. This is
a nationwide problem and some of our Scots clients are included in our
global figure.''

SNOOKER
WORLD champion Stephen Hendry needed only 69 minutes to whitewash
Middlesbrough professional Jon Birch 5-0 as he powered past the local
favourite in the first round of the #330,000 Skoda Grand Prix at
Sunderland yesterday.
''I just can't compete with that. Stephen never missed a ball,'' said
shell-shocked Birch.
Hendry opened the floodgates with a break of 103 in the opening frame
and never looked back. The Scot, whose first major tournament success
came at the 1987 Grand Prix, said: ''This will always be a special event
for me.''
Mike Hallett blasted his opponent and senior referee John Williams
after losing 5-4 to Neal Foulds.
The Grimsby man, unhappy about the award of a free ball in the
deciding frame, said: ''I've put in a complaint about John, and Neal has
totally lost my respect as a professional.''
An incensed Hallett continued: ''Neal knows exactly what he's done.
He's tried it on and got the result he wanted.''
Foulds countered: ''I gave Mike plenty of chances to look at the
situation but all he wanted to do was sit in his chair shaking his head
and sulking.''
Foulds, trailing 27-0, laid a snooker off the free ball, Hallett's
escape let Foulds in, and he put together a 31 break, later sealing
victory with a 35.
World No.28 Foulds now meets defending champion John Higgins tomorrow.
Peter Ebdon, who won the title in 1993, rallied after an early scare
to beat fellow Londoner Steve Ventham 5-2. Steve Davis shrugged off
jet-lag and a lack of practice to beat Oxford's Lee Richardson 5-2.  But
Terry Griffiths joined John Parrott and Dave Harold as top-16 casualties
when he lost 5-1 to fellow Welshman Steve Newbury.

Ross Finlay takes a car which is losing something of its split
personality out on the road
WHILE the new Proton Persona Compact officially went on sale last
Wednesday, there was some doubt, at a test session and press conference
in Callander, whether all the dealers would actually have a demonstrator
in stock before this week. That openness is typical of Proton Cars (UK),
which was originally an independent British company, is now a wholly
owned subsidiary of Proton in Malaysia, and has been frank in its
official statements right from day one.
Proton is an intriguing operation, a joint venture set up in 1983
between Mitsubishi of Japan and what amounted to the government of
Malaysia. A factory was built near Kuala Lumpur, and component suppliers
were encouraged to establish themselves nearby. While the Mpi saloons
which are still on sale here were a first crack at car design,
international business is booming as more modern cars come on stream.
The British company admits that it needs to sort out its image
problems, and also reshape its dealer network to give each of the
retailers more territorial elbow room. Something like 80,000 Protons
have been sold in the UK so far, but the ambition is to reach a figure
around 35,000 per year by the end of the decade, when Proton's range
will have extended to the point of having a model in every major sector.
Proton depended a lot on Mitsubishi in the past, but now runs its own
research and development department. It has other supplier partnerships
in mind, notably with Rover and Citroen. We will soon be seeing European
engines under Proton bonnets.
Shorter and a little lower than the other Personas, the Compact has a
similarly styled interior. Passenger space is rather more supermini
sized than Proton likes to admit, but the rear headroom will let a
six-footer sit there with no stooping.
Proton offers the Compact in three versions, all with different engine
sizes, trim and equipment levels. The 1.3 GLi costs #7799, the 1.5 GLSi
comes at #8799, and the 1.6 SEi has a showroom tag of #10,499.
As with all Proton's Mitsubishi-sourced engines, the 1.3 looks the
best buy, from the point of view of performance compared with price,
although the other models are certainly better equipped.
On the road, this version seemed lively and responsive, although in
their efforts to provide light steering the Malaysians have created the
same impression as the Japanese did before them. There is little
''feel'', almost to the extent of making the driver wonder if connection
between the steering wheel and the front tyres is by mechanical means at
all.
That apart, the 1.3 was pleasant to drive, with fair handling but, on
Perthshire roads, noticeable tyre noise. However, the test Compacts were
mostly on brands of tyre which will not be on the showroom cars; so that
criticism may disappear.
For whatever reason, this car had a much more supple ride than the
first Persona saloon I drove. The early ones jiggled their way over any
but the smoothest surfaces.
You can expect the 74bhp 1.3 to hit 60mph in something like 13.5
seconds and go on to a test track maximum at about 102mph, all this with
a likely average fuel consumption of around 37mpg. Comparable figures
for the 1.5 are 12.1 seconds, 107mph and 35mpg. There is very little in
it.
The top of the range 1.6 SEi has a sportier look, a 111bhp engine, the
ability to reach 60mph in fewer than 11 seconds, a test track maximum of
116mph, and overall fuel consumption around 34mpg. The smooth automatic
transmission example I tried seemed under-geared and mechanically rather
noisy, until my driving partner noticed it had an overdrive button we
had not investigated.
With the overdrive in action, and the 24mph per 1000rpm cruising speed
established, there was naturally a great improvement. But I still feel
that the entry level 1.3 may be the natural Compact buy.

THE Great Britain women's hockey squad continues its build-up for the
Olympic qualifying tournament next month in South Africa by setting up
camp in Spain so that the players can train in the sunshine.
The squad will be based in Madrid and, during their stay in the
Spanish capital, they will play their hosts, the gold medallists in
Barcelona three years ago, in three Tests, starting this evening.
They arrived in Madrid last Sunday minus assistant coach Mike Gilbert,
who had to withdraw because of work commitments. Gilbert, a manager with
GEC Marconi in Edinburgh, said: ''I am naturally very disappointed at
having to pull out, but these are very exciting times with five Scots in
a squad which possesses such great potential.''
Gilbert's unavailability could also have far reaching effects on
Scottish hockey generally. He is one of the country's most involved
coaches and is very much the favourite to succeed Neil Menzies as
national coach to the senior women's squad.
Scotland's next major international egagement will be the World Cup
preliminary round in Trinidad and Tobago next October. Brent Deans, the
Scottish director, will be hoping to have a new coach in place before
the turn of the year so that he can monitor the squad's preparation
immediately after the indoor season finishes in early March.
Should Gilbert be unavailable then Deans would have a serious problem
on his hands. Few of the other candidates possess Gilbert's experience
and Deans might be forced to look abroad for a suitable replacement.
Meanwhile, the Scottish contingent in the GB squad, Pauline Robertson,
Diane Renilson, Susan Fraser, Rhona Simpson and Susan MacDonald, could
now find themselves vulnerable without someone to fight their corner.
The players will clearly have to be even more committed and professional
in their attitude than ever before if they are to overcome the obstacles
that could now be placed in their path by the English management in the
absence of Gilbert.

BADMINTON's Fiona McEwan and wrestling's Sandy McNeil have been voted
on to the Scottish Commonwealth Games Council -- after a marathon vote.
It took four ballots to find the successful pair from a list of seven
candidates.
Among the non-starters is well-known athletics starter Barry
Craighead, the others being boxing's Frank Hendry, bowling's John
Darling, shooting's Bob Aitken and swimming's Ian Mason.
McEwan and McNeil are both highly experienced officials and were team
managers for their respective sports at the last Commonwealth Games, in
Victoria, Canada. McEwan's election brings to three the number of
badminton representatives on the council, Stewart Coghill being the
treasurer and Ian Brown having been elected vice-president at the agm
last April.
The vacancies were caused by the death of the Scottish Weightlifting
Association secretary, Ian Thomson, and the decision of athletics not to
endorse the nomination of veteran official Isobel Robertson.

NORTH and Midlands are aiming for another big McDiarmid Park pay-day
when they play Western Samoa in a floodlit game at St Johnstone's ground
on November 14. Despite initial fears that the concept of taking
top-grade rugby to football grounds might not fit the bill, the practice
is becoming an accepted part of the marketing exercise and the Perth
venue may even be one of the grounds used for the pool which Scotland
will host during the 1999 Rugby World Cup.
McDiarmid Park was the venue for the Scotland A v Italy game in
January and yesterday North and Midlands SRU representative John
McCaffer revealed that the game had made a profit of nearly #30,000.
''That game, which attracted a crowd of over 6600, was an outstanding
success,'' said McCaffer. ''Once all the costs had been met St Johnstone
were able to send a cheque for #27,000 to the SRU, plus another
#2000-plus from programme sales.
''That game made the A fixture a financially viable commodity,
certainly the biggest rugby money-spinner outside of internationals and,
hopefully, we can repeat the exercise when North and Midlands play the
Western Samoans.''
The game, which kicks off at 7.30pm and is being promoted in
conjunction with Perth and Kinross District Council, is as yet
unsponsored but, said McCaffer, negotiations were continuing with a well
known company.
He added that the McDiarmid Park facility has capacity for more than
10,500 spectators and part of its appeal was its central localtion.
''The ground is within 90 minutes of 90 per cent of the Scottish
population. They have fantastic floodlights and, because it is being
played on a Tuesday, the decision was taken to make it a night game so
that more people have the opportunity to come along,'' he said. ''Before
we have even started to market it properly, more than #2000-worth of
tickets have been sold.
''Prior to the Scotland A game, which was played here in January,
there were a lot of people in important places who were a bit worried
about playing in a football stadium, but after the success of that game
these doubts have largely disappeared.''
The district council, which is keen to promote Perth and Kinross as
''Scotland's centre for sport,'' is heavily involved in planning for the
match and on the same day a New Image Rugby Festival for youngsters will
be held in the Bells Sports Centre.
Additionally, as curtain-raisers to the main event at McDiarmid Park,
there are to be matches involving two local under-16 sides, and former
Scotland internationalist Sean Lineen is recruiting a Scottish Classics
XV to to take on a Perth and Kinross Select.
The North and Midlands outing against the tourists is sandwiched
between the game against Scotland A at Mansfield Park on the Sunday and
the Murrayfield Test the following Saturday. On the basis that there may
well be conflicts of personnel and the North and Midlands probably will
not choose their side until the Scotland A XV has been picked on
November 1.
However, it will be left up to individual players to determine whether
they felt able to face the tourists twice within the space of three
days.
Certainly, at yesterday's press conference in Perth, North and
Midlands captain David McIvor said that he would have no problem coping
with a double dose of the Samoans. But whether he meant the Sunday
outing with Scotland A or the full Test at Murrayfield six days later he
wasn't saying!
Scotland flanker and captaincy favourite Rob Wainwright had been due
at yesterday's press conference, but broke down en route from Catterick
military camp, where he is an Army doctor.
''We should stress it is the car which has broken down, not Rob,''
said Lineen. However, as a certainty for the Scotland side, Wainwright
would not have been on parade with his district colleagues in any case.
Wainwright is due to return to club rugby in Scotland from West
Hartlepool in December and will, according to McCaffer, continue to play
his district rugby for North and Midlands.
However, it was also announced yesterday that former North and
Midlands stalwarts Andy Nicol (now with Bath) and Martin Scott (Orrell)
would not be able to re-enlist with North and Midlands because of
competing interests.

McGREGOR The Third can confirm himself an exciting newcomer to chasing
with victory in today's Bedale Novices' Chase at Newcastle. The former
top eventer took to his new job like a natural at Carlisle a fortnight
ago, jumping extremely well and scoring hard held by a distance.
Unlike many recruits from the eventing arena, McGregor The Third looks
to possess plenty of speed and will not be put out of court by the fast
surface. Although his opponents were not up to much, the gelding could
not have been more impressive at Carlisle and should follow up under a
penalty.
Clares Own is a confident choice for an uncompetitive Durham Handicap
Chase. Rivals Sword Beach, Bad Trade and Laurie-O are all very much on
the downgrade nowadays and have each looked temperamental to boot.
Elsdon could prove the best bet on the day's other jumping card at
Exeter.
The gelding has yet to reproduce over hurdles the fair form he
displayed on the Flat last year. But he is almost certainly capable of a
good deal better than he showed when fourth at Uttoxeter, where he was
given a notably easy time once lack of fitness began to tell two flights
from home.
Elsdon figures on an attractive mark in the Kitsons Selling Handicap
Hurdle and he can repay a large part of the 2000 guineas he cost.
On the Flat at Yarmouth, Stately can make light of 7st 11lb in the
Billockby Nursery Handicap over a mile.
The filly landed some hefty bets when she took a seven-furlong event
at Catterick last month and was again well-supported when third at
Warwick last time.

<HEADLINE>Scientists need to be wild, seminar told. Market forces a threat to research</HEADLINE>

SCIENTISTS are in danger of becoming too tame due to the pressure of
market forces, said a leading agricultural economist yesterday.
Squeezing out ''blue skies'' research in the pursuit of self-funding
arrangements could be counter-productive, according to Professor John
Marsh, director of the centre for agricultural strategy at Reading.
''Scientists have to be wild; the wilder the better,'' he said.
''There is a danger that scientists are going to get channelled down a
rather discrete set of perceptions of what is valuable or what is
socially convenient, whereas truly exciting things in science happen
when somebody sees something unexpected which most of his colleagues
recognise as being unimportant but suddenly, to him, there is a vision
there.''
Professor Marsh, who was speaking at a Society of Chemical Industry
seminar on plant-derived oils in London, said market forces could lead
to the loss of such visionaries. There had to be a mix of both basic or
fundamental research and that driven by market demands.
He said he was not in disagreement with Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF)
policy. ''It seems to be very right that a Ministry of Agriculture
should be focusing on the interests of agriculture and food and the
policy problems that relate to them.
''What is dangerous is if that leads, for example, to the funds
provided by the Department of Education and Science being floated off
away from blue skies issues into competing for and contracting for the
little bit of money that comes out of MAFF research.''
This applied to what seemed to be increasingly obscure elements of
biotechnical research in the developed world, where the resulting
products could supplant cheaper natural products from Third World
countries. Genetic engineering of oil seed plants to produce oils with a
wide variety of uses was one example.
Also speaking at the seminar, Dr Kieran Elborough of Durham University
revealed how a Zeneca Bioproducts funded project on oil seeds was
leading to a greener environment.
After three years, it is close to providing an engineered oil seed
that can store the base material to produce a biodegradable plastic for
packaging.
Up to now this plastic has been produced on a vast factory scale at
Ammingham, Humberside, through the fermentation of a micro-organism. But
the new process is thought to be cheaper and cleaner.
Healthfood shops play a key role in this development with the
scientists buying in wheatgerm to provide the key genetic material that
allows rapid multiplication of the enzymes required.

THE best Highland cattle found no difficulty in attracting the
attention of buyers in Oban yesterday, but there were far too many more
ordinary examples of a breed which is most definitely missing the
overseas demand which took it to the height of fashion pre-BSE, writes
DAN BUGLASS.
The top price was 3700gns paid twice. The first bid at this mark came
for the three-year-old in-calf heifer, Baravalla Uasail 21st of
Dreachacha from CK Stewart, East Bridgelands, Selkirk, selling to Ewan
Cameron, Glen Nevis, Fort William.
At the same bid Tom McLatchie, Millerston, Ayr, sold his April 1994
in-calf Aillsa 3rd of Millerston to Dick Bleazard, Glenjaam, Moniaive.
At 3400gns Captain Farquharson's Trust, Invercauld, Braemar, sold an
in-calf heifer to A&amp;A Mackenzie, Seaview, Scourie, Sutherland, while at
2700gns A &amp; E Lund, Spindlewood, Doncaster, purchased one from Glasgow
City Council and another at the 1900gns from the same vendors.
Dick Bleazard bought another at 2500gns from Her Majesty the Queen's
fold at Balmoral. George Bannerman from Yorkshire paid 2500gns for an
in-calf heifer from Mrs Judy Nelson, Achnacloich, Oban, while the Durham
School of Agriculture went to 2200gns to secure one from Mrs Janet
Nelson, Glengorm, Tobermory, Mull.
Andrew and Elizabeth Tosh, Tullochard, Perth, paid 2200gns buying the
best of the yearling heifers from A&amp;A Mackenzie. An April-born heifer
calf from David Fellowes Cladich, Dalmally, sold at 2200gns to Steven
Strang, Dunblane, while a five-year-old cow with heifer calf at foot
from the executors of the late J Smith, Newton Mearns, sold for 3100gns
to Redcastle Farms, Arbroath.
Bulls were a very mixed show selling to a top of 1500gns for one from
Argyll Estates to Tom Muirhead Estates, Corriemucklock, Kinross. The
bottom price for bulls was a mere 70gns.

THE Hill Farming Committee of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland
met at Ingliston yesterday to finalise the union's case for the 1995
Hill Farming Review.
Following a meeting, convener John Scott said the most recent
assessment showed that farmers in the north and north-west would be
particularly hard hit this season.
''Producers in these areas are particularly in need of additional
help. However, higher HLCAs are needed, not only for these producers but
for all hill farmers and crofters in Scotland,'' he said.
The union is seeking support from MPs to gain improvements in the Hill
Livestock Compensatory Amounts which would alleviate problems. Mr Scott
said: ''The union has already circulated a briefing leaflet to all
Scottish MPs and Members of the House of Lords on the importance of hill
farming to Scotland's rural life, and on the importance of HLCAs to hill
farming.''
A further meeting to examine the extent of the problem will be held
today.

THE threatened closure of Castlemilk Money Advice Centre featured
heavily in the local press but probably went unnoticed by most
Glaswegians. The project's Urban Aid funding recently came to an end,
and although Glasgow City Council is prepared to continue to part fund
it, it claims that it cannot finance the full running costs.
Castlemilk used to be a rent-arrears blackspot, but the money advice
centre changed this through debt counselling and other services. None of
the project's clients has ever been evicted and countless people have
escaped the clutches of unscrupulous back-street money-lenders.
Through its work the centre has injected more than #1m annually into
an ailing local economy -- and all this for an annual cost of around
#120,000. No other project has ever achieved this.
The consequences of the closure of this project will be far-reaching.
Debt and financial problems can lead to marital breakdown, domestic
violence, and other crimes.
Some of Castlemilk's housing has been improved, but the majority of
people are still living in homes which are difficult to heat. Many
people face the hard choice of whether to put food on the table or turn
on the heating. The centre helped people deal with these dilemmas.
It offers not just practical advice; it offers hope when people most
need it. Poverty is not simply about lack of money -- it is also about
lack of hope.
The council has an anti-poverty strategy, but in practice it seems
bent on increasing poverty rather than combating it. Elected members
have publicly voiced their support for the continuation of the project,
but mere talk will not prevent the social scourge of debt.
The project staff are continuing to man their desks even though the
advice centre officially wound up on September 29. They are doing this
in the hope that another source of funding will be found.
It is outrageous that Glasgow City Council, the Castlemilk
Partnership, and the Scottish Office can so readily permit this
essential social and economic resource to be lost to our community and
thereby seriously undermine the regeneration of Castlemilk.

ALAN Grant in his letter about The Scandinavian example (October 16)
asks why Norway and Denmark, with roughly the same populations as
Scotland, have flourishing economies while Scotland's continues to
flounder. He asks how they do it. Quite simply because their native
language is not English.
Scotland, like Ireland, is cursed (or blessed?) with the combination
of a good(ish) educational system, the English language, and, most
important a worldwide range of wealthy countries all speaking English
and all eager to capture our best and brightest for their own economies.
So in Scotland, it's graduate and emigrate, whether it be to Canberra,
California, or Croydon.
An educated Norwegian or Dane, while probably having a working
knowledge of English, cannot possibly compete with an educated native
English speaker anywhere in the world where the working language is
English.
So he stays put, makes the best of it and channels all his
intelligence and energy into being a success in his own land -- which a
cynic might say is all that he can do given that there are not many
other countries in the world where Norwegian or Danish is the first
language.
This is a process which has been going on so long that it is virtually
irreversible and should Scottish independence be achieved will no doubt
continue or even accelerate as long as the rewards overseas are so high.
We have the recent (in historical terms) example of the Irish
Republic, independent from the United Kingdom for over 70 years and with
a population less than before the Second World War. And when we consider
that Ireland was neutral in the war, the scope of emigration of people
seeking a more satisfying life outside Ireland is staggering.
Short of a wall, from Solway to Tyne (as Berlin) or forbidding
emigration from Scotland under pain of severe punishment (as Cuba), we
will in human resource terms continue to export the gold and keep the
dross.

FURTHER to the letter regarding the closure of Merchiston Hospital
(October 14), I am writing in support of its residents and to express my
opposition to any plans for closure.
As a volunteer worker in the tea bar I have come to realise that, in
the residents' opinion, this is neither a hospital nor an institution.
This is home, where they feel safe and secure.
They are among friends and their abilities are encouraged. If they
have physical or emotional problems, support is at hand immediately to
help.
We would not like to hear that our home is to be shut because someone
else thinks they know what is in our best interests. Those with severe
learning disabilities deserve equal consideration.
The anxiety caused to the residents and to their families is shocking;
it may undo many years of gradual training and the building-up of
confidence of the disabled person.
This does not appear to be a case of the individual gaining in life
skills and expressing a desire to try a more independent form of living
when they feel ready, but rather this appears to be a case of economy,
closure by a set date and hopefully someone will pick up the pieces.
Is it a coincidence that this site is very handy for commuting to
Glasgow and therefore may be of considerable commercial value?

THE end of the Conservative Party Conference at Blackpool came as an
immense relief to me as the political silliness of the week finally
stopped. The only notable feature of this conference, maybe gaining a
footnote in history, was that never in the field of political rhetoric
has so much dangerous, sadistic, vicious, and dogmatic claptrap been
orated by so few.
It will surprise no-one that law and order was the big feature among
the Tories' increasingly geriatric faithful. It did not escape my
attention that as they worked themselves into hysterics about punishing
the poor and semi-literate, who mainly populate our prisons, their
leaders failed to address the increasing problem of the white-collar
criminal.
Your readers might recall the cases of Terry Ramsden, who pleaded
guilty to a #90m fraud, receiving a two-year suspended sentence, or of
Roger Levitt who incurred the draconian punishment of 180 hours'
community service for a mere #9m scam. I wonder whom these two vote for?
Illicit drugs are now considered a major problem and as there is no
longer a Soviet threat the Tories have to find jobs for the boys of MI6
on the government payroll and surprise, surprise, these ''spies'' are to
be used in the fight against the Moriartys of organised crime in the
illicit drugs business.
This nonsense makes one hold one's sides with laughter because the
truth of the matter is that the police are only as good as their best
informers and in this murky business of drug-dealing most drug-dealers
are police informants anyway.
The numbers involved in this business who are informants might even be
as high as 90% and certainly no less than 50%. The reality is the police
know who the drug-dealers are but for their own reasons allow them to
remain on the street.
In a nutshell the introduction of MI6 into the so-called war against
drugs will make little difference, if any, even with the assistance from
GCHQ with all their sophisticated listening techniques.
One would have though that even this Tory administration recognises
these golden rules of economics of supply on demand, and the consumer
being king.
Further, on the theme of law and order, honest John Major announces
there are going to be another 10,000 surveillance cameras put up
purportedly to combat crime.
It is too easy to draw comparisons with George Orwell's warnings in
his writings. However, the British people had better start waking up to
what is taking place in this country instead of behaving like
''sheeple'' who can easily be frightened by bogymen and fettered and
herded into an unthinking herd just as was the fate of the animals in
Animal Farm.

LORD McCluskey claims that being tough on crime yields no dividends
(October 14). But the stark fact is that in America, as in Britain, the
Governments are tougher on senior citizens than they are on criminals.
The poor in both countries are significantly worse-off than most
criminals, who are well-housed, well-fed, and supplied with colour TVs
and pool tables.
But there are places where they are really tough on crime. In certain
Islamic countries where the loss of a hand is often the price demanded
of criminals the rate of offending is substantially lower than in
Western democracies.
Perhaps if the political parties listened less to the hysterics of
over-liberal penal reformers and more to the voices of their
constituents the criminal elements would be treated in a fashion that
makes less of a mockery of justice and they would be made to suffer
something more akin to that suffered by their victims.

IRVINE WATSON'S emotions are understandable, but can he really be
suggesting that the 80% of criminals who re-offend should not be
entitled to a court hearing (October 17)? Had a close relative of his
been accused of a crime and automatically imprisoned because they had a
previous conviction, perhaps he would be demanding a different sort of
justice.

MICHAEL Forsyth's package of 500 extra police is anything but handsome
(October 14). The reality is that if the 500 were allocated to
Strathclyde Police alone it would not provide one extra officer on duty
in each given area at any given time.
Only this year was Leslie Sharp allowed to bring the actual strength
of his force up to the authorised establishment which had existed since
1975 but this had to be achieved by sacrificing much of his overtime
budget. A beggar's bargain.
The effect of this is that most overtime worked is now compensated by
time off with the result that the number of officers on duty at any time
has probably decreased rather than increased. Morale has plummeted.
It would make much more sense if the money to finance 500 more
officers was allocated to police budgets so that existing establishment
of constables and sergeants could be paid for all hours worked.
The overheads of employing extra officers absorb much money which
would be far better managed by employing existing officers on overtime
only when required.
This Government has so eroded the conditions of service of the police
it will not readily be trusted in future. The sops now being offered
will be looked upon as too little, too late.

THE Welsh propensity for hyperbole does not excuseGriff Rhys Jones's
preposterous claim that ''we'' (presumably the British) ''are truly a
nation of poetry lovers''. One in every 5000 (0.02%) of the population
took part in the poll.
It may have been ''a victory for the poems we learned at school'' but
that ''victory'' has the effect of stilling any poetic impulse,
receptive or creative, in the vast majority.
The average modestly talented born poet may take decades to recover
and to move from ''mute inglorious Milton'' to ''glib notorious
McGonagall'' status and then only with massive and intense support from
writers' groups and poetry workshops.
Competitions, polls, and suchlike are for those, the vast majority, in
our society who loathe poetry because they can neither understand it nor
do it but sense obscurely, and correctly, that it is what life is really
all about.
Academics, critics, and profoundly uncreative people such as local
councillors, public relations persons, and accountants need to establish
criteria of poetic ''excellence'' so that they will know what poems and
poets they may safely read, claim to prefer, quote, and inflict on the
young.
Kipling would, I am sure, be delighted that his ironic masterpiece has
acquired the status of No 1 True Brit Poem in these days of evaporated
empire. In post-imperial Britain ''Mr If'' might do as a model male for
a very young Evangelical virgin but he wouldn't be good company on a
Setterday nicht in the Sarry Heid or even in the Clutha or Edinburgh's
West End Hotel where living, breathing, probably insignificant poets
like me perform for fun.
Understood as rhyming, rhythmic public rhetoric (the way in which the
polled interpret it) If is mere bardic bombast for moralistic
mediocrities and Kipling stands accused of prosodic posing.
Seen from the inside it is the subtle revenge of a sensitive genius

WHAT a jaw-dropping phrase appears in your editorial, Forsyth out of
tune (October 12). You refer to the Scottish Secretary's special adviser
as ''the radical Mr Warner''.
Now, to anyone familiar with Gerald Warner's views this is akin to
describing a bird of paradise as a sort of raven or the Patriarch of
Constantinople as like the Moderator of the Free Presbyterian Synod.
Mr Warner's politics are so highly complex, exotic, and polychromatic
that it is difficult briefly to convey their gist. In vulgar shorthand
we may say that his main political colours are those of the deepest
blue, right-wing reactionary, tinged with primrose, Disraelian ''one
nation'' stripes, and sporting the white cockade of romantic Jacobitism.
Be absolutely certain, however, that any radical hues in Mr Forsyth's
speech are entirely his own.
Where you are on firmer ground is in seeking the authorial hand of Mr
Warner in the text of the speech. I could not trace any allusion to
Kipling in your page 8 report but I did find an utterly conclusive
vindication of your opinion.
Earlier this year Mr Warner, then a journalist, became very excited at
something I said in conversation with an English historian: that
Scotland had mounted a spectacularly successful takeover bid in 1603
when James VI, King of Scots, inherited the English throne. Within weeks
this argument appeared, almost verbatim, in Mr Warner's Sunday Times
column.
Now, on October 12, Robbie Dinwoodie reports Mr Forsyth: ''In 1603 at
the Union of the Crowns, Scotland executed one of the most spectacular
takeovers in history when our monarchy inherited the English throne.''
My intellectual property rights have been infringed not once but
twice. I would sue for plagiarism but, alas, who will be the defendant:
the Secretary of State for Scotland or his special adviser?

JOHN Linklater's article on the arrival of Perudo in Glasgow -- the
game that encourages players to lie in their teeth -- interests me
greatly (October 16).
At the end of the Second World War we were stationed in camps outside
Ranchi in Bihar where to while away an hour of an evening five or six of
us would repair to the Indian (Naafi) canteen to play Liar's Dice. A
game which John Linklater states correctly was ''a lot of fun'' but in
our case, without sounding self-righteous, there was no drunken loutish
behaviour.
The bluffing was accompanied by a few Carew's gins or Bullfight
brandies followed by a fixed menu supper of six fried eggs, chips, bread
and butter, and tea.
On one occasion we broke the monotony of the menu by ordering a dozen
eggs each. The sight of six large plates each with 12 fried eggs and a
mound of chips is still a vivid memory. It goes without saying that on
our next visit we reverted to the standard half-dozen.

TIE Rack has created a long-term growth strategy which seems as if it
will be unstoppable, unless chairman Roy Bishko does something utterly
out of character.
The emphasis is on innovation such as Disney characters, Asterix and
Winnie the Pooh for the fun ties, and waistcoats and socks. However, the
core business remains the spots and stripes, although some of the more
exotic runs are as short as just 500 units to give an air of
exclusivity.
The company opened 38 new outlets in the first 28 weeks to raise the
total to 360 in 24 countries including 16 in Scotland, with another 20
or so planned for the remainder of the year.
Among them will be a branch in Tokyo railway station, within a few
yards of the Emperor's waiting rooms. This will make it the first
foreign company to open in the station.
It will also increase the number of airports served to 44 in 17
countries. These are probably the jewels in the crown as they have very
steady, high spending traffic without much seasonal variation. All this
is off a cash rich balance sheet as there is great reluctance to borrow
to fund expansion.
Interim turnover increased 14% to #41.6m while pre-tax profits were
29% ahead at #490,000. The outlook is such that Tie Rack is making its
first half-time dividend payment since 1989 at 0.5p.
Mr Bishko argues that the number of alternative retail outlets for
ties is diminishing which will combat the swing towards more informal
tie-less dressing.
With nearly 60% of sales to come in the remainder of the year and
higher operational gearing, pre-tax profits seem set to rise perhaps #1m
to #8.5m, leaving the shares at 154p trading at 14 times earnings with a
possible 2.4% yield -- the products seem more fun than the shares.

End of a dubious practice
SUDDENLY Europe is not all bad for the British Conservative Party. In
the space of a few hours yesterday the European Court of Justice
produced two important rulings which should play well with the UK
Government, and the European Commission issued a glossy pamphlet
exposing anti-Brussels misrepresentation in the British (mainly London)
press. By far the most important is the ruling by the ECJ that so-called
''positive discrimination'' in favour of women has gone too far in a
test case in Germany. The implications could be huge for all of the
European Union's 15 member states unless, of course, the European
Commission -- greatly miffed by the judges' decision -- simply succeeds
in moving the goalposts by amending a suspect law.
To do so, however, would require unanimity in the Council of Ministers
and a battle in the European Parliament where there is much sympathy for
the commission's view, especially among socialist and women Euro-MPs,
but not necessarily a political majority. Most objective people will
welcome the judgment if only on the grounds that there is something
naturally suspect about a law which routinely discriminates in favour of
one sex when contenders for a job are of equal merit. While fairness and
balance between the sexes are desirable in employment there can be no
doubt that picking a woman over an equally qualified man in all cases,
bar none, where there is a numerical imbalance favouring men is a
dubious practice. This is the nub of the court's finding which states
that national rules guaranteeing women absolute and unconditional
priority for appointment or promotion go beyond promoting equal
opportunities and overstep the limits of EU law.  The commission has
done its best to help women. But its critics should remember that
European Union directives do not become law without the agreement of the
member states, including ours. For the same states now to dilute the law
would require a change of the collective mind which seems unlikely.
The commission is now left wondering what to do for the best and has
admitted that the implications for women in work could be significant.
That could be an understatement. As for Labour's much-criticised policy
of having women-only short lists in winnable parliamentary seats, there
is room for some doubt about its legality. Labour might not be an
employer of prospective MPs but selection committees undeniably do
decide their employment prospects on the basis of unequal treatment.
This political aspect of the ruling could run and run.

THERE was a time when the ''Bank that likes to say Yes'' reached the
parts that other banks didn't reach. At the end of the last war the
various Trustees Savings Banks had more customers than any other UK
banking institution.
The Trustees movement was born in the South-west of Scotland and, even
after the amalgamations which grouped the local banks together, TSB
Scotland was still a separate bank. Ten years ago it was still very much
the jewel in the TSB crown commanding a huge proportion of the group's
total deposit taking.
It maintained its formidable reach into working-class communities
while its no-nonsense style of banking was particularly popular in many
rural areas.
Given the origins of the Trustees movement managers tended to be
cautious and paternalistic. A former colleague used to retail the story
of how, on retirement, she was determined to blow a substantial part of
her life savings on a round-the-world cruise.
So devastated was her TSB manager by this reckless venture that he
pursued her out of the bank and up the High Street cautioning her to
think again and leave the money in her savings account!
That sort of bank managing has gone out of style although it can be
preferable to today's more flexible friend with instructions to push
credit at any price and charge an arrangement fee on top.
As long as the TSB belonged to its depositors it offered a distinctive
presence in the High Streets with a special ethos and traditional roots
among working men and women and a particular mission to encourage saving
among the young.
My Edinburgh Savings Bank coin collector was a more impressive part of
my childhood than any piggy bank could ever be. Apart from anything else
once a coin disappeared into its maw it could be opened only by a visit
to the savings bank itself.
When in 1984 the TSB Group proposed to float itself and become just
another bank, the SNP and many others fought a strong campaign to keep
the bank Scottish and under the control of its depositors.
Before the TSB could be taken from its depositors an Act of Parliament
was required to make the theft legal. The campaign of opposition
climaxed in a successful amendment tabled in the Lords by Lord Taylor of
Gryfe excluding TSB Scotland from the Act.
Although the Government bulldozed their way through in the end the
campaign was successful in extricating a number of Government-backed
assurances from the TSB Group which were crystallised in parliamentary
assurances.
They involved a commitment that the TSB would continue to have a head
office in Scotland and that the registered office of the TSB Group would
be based here. There was also provision to support the TSB charitable
foundation in Scotland.
But in the light of the current proposals for what is euphemistically
being styled as a ''merger'' of the TSB with Lloyds, the crucial
undertaking for Scotland is that which obliges the directors to take
account not only of the interests of the shareholder but also of the
interests of the customer, the staff, and the wider concern of Scotland.
What the TSB's employees, customers, and the wider Scottish public are
now entitled to know is exactly how Lloyds and the TSB propose to
enshrine these undertakings in their proposed merged structure and how
that will be reflected in the private legislation that will be necessary
to make their merger a reality.
The privatised TSB has hardly been a great success story. The group
had its fingers badly burnt in the ill-starred venture into merchant
banking when it bought Hill Samuel in 1987.
Many customers on the receiving end of the branch-closure programme
might think that the profits would have been better deployed in
sustaining the TSB branch network rather than squandered in the City of
London. The TSB has become just another bank and now it is to be
effectively taken over by just another High Street bank.
Although many of the fears of the campaigners of a decade ago have
come true at least the assurances have offered some protection to
Scotland. There are some 500 jobs in the Edinburgh head office of the
TSB and in the Glasgow-based home loans business. In part these
head-office operations are here today as a result of the Scottish card
played then.
The question is where do we stand in the new merged structure. The key
undertaking of 10 years ago was the responsibility of the directors to
the interests of the TSB's staff and to the wider interests of Scotland.
The two Knights engaged in the financial carve-up -- Pitman of Lloyds
and Goodison of the TSB -- had better start coming up with exact details
on how they propose to honour these obligations in their new merged
bank.
This particularly applies to Brian Pitman who has made his reputation
with the City by forecasting more and faster redundancies in the
financial sector than any other leading banker.
If clear and satisfactory answers are not forthcoming then he might
recall the lesson from the experience of the TSB top brass a decade ago.
With private legislation required to consummate his proposed merger even
the best-laid financial wheezes can hit a rock of determined opposition.

AFTER a gestation period of six years, the Scottish Constitutional
Convention has at last delivered its final version of how a Scottish
parliament should be set up, financed, and operated. Gone is the ideal
of guaranteeing through legislation that 50% of the MPs would be women.
Complicated suggestions of assigning all VAT receipts and income tax
from Scotland to the parliament are also removed, replaced instead with
a continuation of the present block grant from Westminster based on the
Barnett formula. So perhaps it is not so revolutionary in concept as at
first proposed; but instead it is more workmanlike and therefore more
likely to become a reality if Labour wins the next General Election and
delivers its election promise of a devolved Scottish parliament.
Certainly the controversial ability to raise -- or lower -- income tax
by 3p in the pound still exists, but is now couched in cautious terms
which suggest that a Scottish parliament would think long and hard
before imposing what the Conservatives decry as a ''Tartan Tax''. It is
a power, the final document states, which is ''unlikely to be used
without a great deal of caution and prudence''. Given the current
thinking of Tony Blair, caution and prudence would be forcefully
inculcated into Labour's representatives on a Scottish parliament.
There are concerns that a Scottish parliament would be another layer
of bureaucracy. In a sense the bureaucracy is already there in the shape
of the Scottish Office. Instead the parliament could be regarded as
simply bringing democracy to that layer. At present the Secretary of
State for Scotland wields enormous power, yet his party has little
support from the Scottish electorate. A Scottish parliament would at
least remove what many people regard as a democratic deficit and should
be welcomed for that change alone.
There are also soothing words for the Scottish business community,
which is still, in the main, suspicious of any change which could add
costs to their operations. The final document is explicit. There would
be no powers to vary corporate tax. It would be ''inconceivable'' that
the parliament would do anything other than encourage innovation and
industry. It would be foolish to assume that all difficulties have been
removed even after six years of deliberation. The West Lothian Question
of whether Scots should still have a say over English legislation at
Westminster when English MPs have no say over legislation in Scotland
will remain contentious. A future Conservative Government, while not
necessarily risking the dangers of dismantling a Scottish parliament
once set up, may nevertheless legislate for fewer Scots MPs at
Westminster. The block grant may also become an annual battleground,
despite what the convention says. English MPs may be less willing to
accept higher Government spending in Scotland, no matter how worthy, if
they have no say on how it is distributed.
The largest unanswered question is what would be the future role of
the Secretary of State for Scotland. His powers would be removed and
given to the parliament, leaving him as a ''political eunuch'' as a
Conservative politician once put it. There is nothing in the document to
suggest he has been given back his manhood. Would a Westminster
Government tolerate having a Scottish Secretary in Cabinet who had no
say in Scotland? And, if not, would the Scottish people accept that a
Scottish parliament was a good trade-off for leaving the country
voiceless in the Cabinet? It is wrong for the convention to say that
this is a matter for Westminster. We should be told now what the
political price is that has to be paid.
In the main this is a scheme which can deliver a parliament which
countless opinion polls have shown the majority of Scots want. It will
be a different kind of parliament, though. It will not have the unsocial
hours of Westminster, it will have more woman MPs, and the additional
member system, while being attacked as undemocratic, will ensure that
Labour will not have automatic absolute power. That in itself should
lead to more consensus politics, and less of the adversarial
Westminster-style politics which have disappointed so many people in
recent years and have taken our politicians to a new low in public
opinion. A Scottish parliament allows for a new start in Scotland. ''The
true test of the parliament will be in its performance in reinvigorating
Scottish life and the Scottish economy,'' says the final document.
Absolutely. The voters deserve this at least: that if the parliament is
finally delivered, the arid point-scoring of Westminster should be left
behind, and the politicians should work together to do just that, to
reinvigorate Scottish life. They will not be forgiven lightly if they
forget these apposite words.

ENTERPRISE
RICHARD Emanuel had just turned 23 when he decided to leave his job
with a communications company and start his own business with his #1500
savings, a #3000 overdraft and one employee.
Now almost five years on, his Glasgow-based company boasts an
estimated #10m turnover, employs 115 staff in 14 branches across
Scotland and has helped put businesses in touch with their travelling
staff through its mobile phones.
Now Mr Emanuel, managing director of DX Communications, is being
heralded as a young entrepreneur in the same mould as Fife's world
famous Andrew Carnegie.
Yesterday he met the benevolent Fifer, in the shape of budding actor
Archie Colquhoun, a third-year mature English student at Stirling
University, who was dressed in 19th-century costume as part of the
Scottish Enterprise backed Year of the Entrepreneur promotion, which is
touring Fife.
It was certainly a case of the old meeting the new as Mr Emanuel
sported his latest pocket-sized phone and Mr Carnegie carried his much
older model.
On Friday Mr Emanuel will travel to Glenrothes to speak at a
conference entitled In the Spirit of Carnegie, alongside Jack Black of
Mindstore, as part of Fife Enterprise's contribution to encouraging
people to set up their own business.
Fife is already helping show the way for business-minded Scots.
Between October 1993 and September 1994 182 new businesses started in
the region, and the figure jumped to 382 between October 1994 and
September this year. Over the last year only 8% of new starts failed
compared with 14% the previous year.
Yesterday Mr Emanuel admitted his role model was Tom Farmer, of
Kwik-Fit fame, who had given him a great deal of advice. He said: ''I
wrote to Tom Farmer asking if I he could find time to talk to and advise
me. He was fantastic and helped me considerably. At that stage I was not
trying to sell him mobile phones but we have since been involved in a
few deals. He is someone I greatly admire and was probably my
inspiration in making me determined to do well.
''But business is all about teamwork. One of the key factors in DX's
growth has been the strength, commitment and experience of the company's
management team.''
Fife businessman Jeff Carter, chairman of Mid Fife Business Trust, who
will chair the Carnegie conference, said: ''Richard's success story is
one of a real high flyer who saw an opportunity and had the resolve and
determination to go for it.
''His experience is not exactly typical of the average business start
up, but he is a great role model for potential entrepreneurs to follow.
We need more of his type in Scotland.''

Nicholas Powell reports on the implications of the French bombings
YESTERDAY'S bomb blast in the Paris underground, the ninth attack in
France and seventh in the capital since the assassination on July 11 of
the Algerian imam, Sahraoui, was a grisly reminder that the civil war in
Algeria has crossed the Mediterranean with a vengeance. The explosion in
a tunnel near to the Orsay Museum station, which left 28 people injured,
five critically, had an unprecedented political dimension. It came only
10 days after the publication of a communique, allegedly by the Algerian
Islamic fundamentalist group, the GIA, claiming responsibility for
bombings earlier this summer and declaring an out and out holy war with
France.
It also occurred less than a week before President Jacques Chirac is
due to meet 54-year-old Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, the
Islamists' main enemy, in Washington.
President Chirac returned to Paris from a trip to the provinces
yesterday morning to monitor the situation and Prime Minister Alain
Juppe, who visited the underground station with Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre shortly after the explosion, told the National Assembly
that the Government would lead the fight against terrorism ''with
determination and tenacity''.
But unanimous political condemnation of the outrage was not able to
drown out criticism from two police unions that the special security
measures introduced over the summer by the Government are simply not
working and that the state is ''lacking in authority'' in the fight
against terrorism.
The shock caused by yesterday's bomb was all the greater as it
followed a lull: a major suspect, Khaled Kelcal, shot dead by gendarmes
on September 29, had even been named by Minister of the Interior Debre
as responsible for most of the summertime attacks. Yesterday's blast,
however, caused by 6kgs of explosive packed into a gas canister and
surrounded with iron bolts, used the same technique as that which
exploded in the Saint Michel underground station, a few hundred yards
away, on July 25.
The gruesomeness of yesterday's blast also appalled public opinion.
Although 200 firemen and nine ambulances were on the spot within minutes
of the explosion shortly after 7am, the difficulty of access to the
tunnel meant that critically injured people waited nearly four hours
before being taken to hospital.
The alleged GIA communique published on October 7 announced that a
holy war would be waged in the cities of France so long as Paris
supported the military junta in power in Algiers and demanded that
President Chirac converts to Islam. Anouar Haddam, leader in exile of
the outlawed FIS (Islamic Salvation Front), the political branch of the
GIA, promptly denied responsibility and accused the Algerian Government
itself of manipulation.
Condemning the bomb attack, the chairman of the National Federation of
French Muslims, Mohamed Bechari, called on President Chirac to cancel
his meeting with President Zeroual, planned in Washington on Sunday or
Monday. That informal summit should take place shortly before the
Algerian presidential election on November 16, which all the country's
opposition parties have denounced as a sham, demanding an end to the
three-year-old state of emergency as a prelude to any democratic
procedure.
Despite French Government reassurances that they intend no
interference in Algerian affairs, the FIS has demanded they change their
Algerian policy, criticising the planned meeting with President Zeroual
as condoning the military junta.
For all the official protests of neutrality, the French Government
long ago sided with the Algerian dictatorship, in the opinion of
Algerian opposition parties. When the Algiers regime in January 1992
suspended General Elections which the FIS had been set to win, before
outlawing the Islamic organisation, Paris could barely disguise its
relief.
Since then, Socialist and Gaullist governments have lobbied in favour
of EU loans for Algeria, which also receives nearly #1000m annual aid,
officially to meet ''economic, social and cultural needs'' direct from
Paris.
The hounding of Islamic militants in France over recent years has
greatly angered the FIS. Islamic militancy, meanwhile, has been winning
increasing support among the most disenchanted of the two million or so
Algerian immigrants who live in France.
Hopes that the Algerian presidential election on November 16 could, at
last, end the fighting which has caused some 40,000 deaths over the past
four years, have all but faded. Over the same period, despite massive
French and international aid, unemployment has risen officially from 19%
to 25% and the gross national product has fallen from $2500 to $1500 per
head. The Algerian dinar has lost half of its value over the past 18
months. Close to economic collapse, the country could also be
approaching political implosion and escalation of its murderous civil
war.

The man behind the legend: Burns biographer Ian McIntyre talks to
William Russell about how the facts do not tally with the popular
perception of the poet
FROM Reith to Rabbie is quite a journey to make. The connection may
not be an obvious one, and they do make strange bedfellows, but Ian
McIntyre has gone from writing the life of one to writing the life of
the other.
Having published a highly praised biography of one great Scot, Lord
Reith of the BBC, he has followed it with one of the ploughman poet,
Robert Burns.
What they have in common is that they have nothing in common -- beyond
being singular Scotsmen about whom McIntyre felt he had something fresh
to say. He does not see Burns as an unlettered tiller of the land, and
neither is he persuaded that the famous portrait of the poet, all
melting, dark, come-hither eyes and immaculately styled hair, which has
decorated countless souvenirs, shows the real man.
The cover of his book, Dirt and Deity, a Life of Robert Burns, carries
the miniature painted on ivory by Alexander Reid in the National
Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. It shows a dark-haired man with a podgy,
Ayrshire face, handsome enough in its way, but not glamorous. It is
stolid rather than sexy, a face still seen up and down the Firth of
Clyde coast on men who pursue bonny lassies. Burns thought it the best
likeness of him. McIntyre agrees.
A man o' pairts, Ian McIntyre, is a former controller of Radio 4, from
1976-78 and Radio 3, from 1978-87. He was founder of many of the current
affairs programmes still broadcast, including Analysis, which he also
presented.
He has been a journalist -- was an associate editor on The Times from
1989-90 when Charlie Wilson was editor -- and was a Conservative Party
apparatchik in charge of the publicity machine in Scotland. Indeed, he
created the Scottish Tory information machine as director of information
from 1962-65. Among his tasks was dealing with the press during Perth
and Kinross by-election for Sir Alec Douglas Home.
He said he had one regret. He did not keep a diary of what were
stirring and entertaining times during the by-election because Sir Alec,
a fine man, but not the most organised of candidates, was inclined to
say whatever came into his head rather than read the carefully scripted
speeches he had been given.
He was also the man the Scots Tories sent to the Borders in 1966 to
try to oust the upstart Liberal, David Steel, who had seized Roxburgh,
Selkirk and Peebles from them the previous year.
Although he failed, he did reduce Steel's majority substantially, so
it was no disgrace. His subsequent experience as candidate-in-residence,
trying to earn a living while keeping the locals happy as to his
attendance record, cured him of any wish to go into politics.
Why did he turn to Burns? There is the bicentenary next year, so the
book is timely. But in truth the two went in tandem. He had signed up
with HarperCollins to write both after leaving The Times five years ago.
The Burns book is out earlier than originally planned; the publishers,
aware of other books being written for next year's celebrations, and
knowing he was well ahead with his work, have brought it out now. As a
result he leads the field.
''I had been struck over the years by a kind of mismatch between the
picture I had in my mind of the man from reading the poems and the
picture which emerged from all the standard biographies,'' he said.
''They did not tally. I thought I saw a much more interesting man than
the one who tends to emerge at Burns suppers, and once I began to look
more thoroughly at his life it seemed an unsatisfactory picture of him.
I also thought it hugely unsatisfactory that the best biography of
Burns, written by an American, Franklin Bliss Snyder, and never
published here, should be almost 60 years old.
''As I read more I found views of him from outside the Scottish
tradition and I began to see a man who tallied more closely with the
person I envisaged him as being. I decided there had to be something new
to say.
''The technique I adopted was to look at what could be absolutely
established and to forget phrases like 'One can well imagine' of which
there are an awful lot in established Burns writing. I wanted to strip
off the accretions, to get past the surrounding legend, to see what lay
underneath. In the book I quote the line from John Ford's The Man Who
Shot Liberty Valance -- 'When the legend conflicts with the facts, print
the legend.' I tried to print only the facts.''
His choice of the miniature portrait was to counter that Valance
attitude because part of any legend is to make the people involved look
more splendid than they really were. His approach may upset some in
Scotland where the Valance approach to the truth, always fashionable, is
at the moment rampant, but Ian McIntyre is not worried about whether he
upsets people.
It would depend on how much they knew about the man, he said. He did
not doubt that some of the more romantically minded members of Burns
clubs would be a bit startled to read some of what he had to say, but he
did not think well-informed Burnsians would be upset.
''One of the things that comes out most strongly from the letters, but
there is also evidence from what people said, is that he must have been
a most tremendous conversationalist, very sharp, bright, and amusing,
but quick to pounce,'' he said.
''The evidence from people he met in Edinburgh all points in this
direction. Here was a mind of great quality. It undermines all that talk
about the unlettered ploughman poet. Burns was no such thing.
''His father had quite old-fashioned ideas about how his children
should be educated, and while it was not a very connected education, he
had a lot of it and he read widely and voraciously. He was certainly a
ploughman, but he was not an unlettered one. Nor was he a particularly
good farmer. He was a better exciseman.''
The Burns he has discovered was a very emotional man -- a part of the
legend not in dispute -- of strong animal passions. He was also
Scotland's first class-conscious poet, a man with a fair-sized chip on
his shoulder whose early life had been hard, who had seen his father
hauled up by the bailiffs and driven into an early grave, an experience
which stayed with him.
Born in Banchory in 1931, but brought up largely in England, Ian
McIntyre now lives in Radlett with his wife, Leik, and a rather
querulous dog -- a plan to live in Cambridge, which they kept returning
to over the years, somehow never materialised -- and they visit Scotland
regularly ''to breath some good clean air''.
He read French and Russian at St John's College, Cambridge, and was
president of the union in 1953. After a year at the College of Europe in
Bruges he went off to do National Service in the Intelligence Corps, got
married, and, in 1957, joined the BBC as a talks producer. His career in
broadcasting, both for the BBC and ITV, as administrator and performer,
was launched. In the course of it he seems to have met or interviewed
pretty well everybody who is still somebody, or was somebody at the
time.
More biographies are planned -- probably something historical. As to
who it would be, he was not saying, but it had to be somebody he was
interested in, who was also commercial. The problem was whenever one
thought of a subject, 99 times out of 100, somebody else was halfway
through a book or had written one five years ago.
''It is not easy finding a good niche,'' he said. But with Rabbie,
even if there is a flood of books to come, he has found such a subject.
Although there have been many books about Burns in the past, he believes
his is different.

Washington, Tuesday -- US industrial production weakened in September
for the first time in five months, the Federal Reserve said today,
adding to signs of a slow-growing economy.
The Fed said total output by the nation's factories, mines and
utilities fell 0.2% -- the first monthly decline since a 0.6% drop in
April -- in large part because of less demand for electricity after an
extremely hot summer.
Industry was operating at 83.8% of total capacity last month, down
from 84.2% in August. That put less pressure on prices and further
restrains inflation.

GOVERNMENT borrowing in September was, at #3700m, slightly less than
the City had been projecting and so had little impact on financial
markets. Its main effect was to help Government securities to firm
initially on relief that it was not still expanding, having fallen from
August's unexpectedly high #4600m. Gilts lost these gains later,
influenced by overseas markets.
The September figure still means, though, that the public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR) -- the gap between state spending and
revenue from taxation -- is most unlikely to reach the Government's
target of #23.6bn for the 1995-96 financial year.
After the September outcome it is already running at #20.7bn in just
six months and, although the main corporation tax paying months are yet
to come. City forecasts for the year now range from #27bn to as high as
#30bn.
A Treasury spokeman commented: ''The outturn for the year may not be
as hoped but the PSBR is clearly on a downward trend.''
Although some City analysts were taking the view that the September
figure had little implication for the Budget, in that the Chancellor
would still be able to cut taxes by up to #3000m, business leaders were
not so confident, or at any rate were more disapproving.
Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said the figures underlined the need for deep public spending
cuts before the Chancellor could consider tax cuts. ''Borrowing the
equivalent of #640 for every man, woman and child in September is just
too much,'' he commented.
Both the CBI and Institute of Directors in their respective Budget
submissions have stressed that it should primarily be aimed at helping
small businesses. The CBI said cuts in personal taxation should only be
made if they were matched by public expenditure reductions.
The Treasury's talk of a downward trend in the PSBR was also greeted
with some cynicism. ''There are no signs of a clear downward trend
becoming established. Barring spectacular growth in corporation tax
receipts in October and January, we are still looking for a substantial
overshoot of the Treasury's #23.6bn summer target,'' was the reaction of
one analyst, who also did not think it would significantly alter the
Budget arithmetic.
The Bank of England, meanwhile, announced that it was to auction
#3000m of 8% gilts dated 2015 on October 25. The proposed issue, which
left the gilt market unmoved, came as no surprise.
In fact, given the PSBR, some dealers felt there would have to be an
extra auction next year to ''balance the books''.

<HEADLINE>Singapore puts most blame on Barings' managers as Labour calls for Commons debate. Report criticises Bank of England</HEADLINE>

THE Bank of England's failure to react strongly to Barings' massive
exposure to Asian stock markets was yesterday highlighted in the
Singapore Government's report on the subsequent collapse of the merchant
bank.
The report prompted Alistair Darling, the Labour Party's spokesman on
City affairs, to call for a House of Commons debate on Barings'
downfall.
He said it was essential to examine the way in which the Bank of
England supervised the UK banking system, as well as the relationship
between Britain's supervisory system and those of its international
counterparts.
However, Singapore laid most of the blame for the Barings debacle at
the door of the then-management of the merchant bank, for failing to
control the dealings of Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson.
The report said Barings' large Asian margin deposits late last year,
which partly reflected the extent of Mr Leeson's huge positions, ''did
not evoke a strong reaction'' from the Bank of England.
A large exposures report submitted by Barings to the Bank of England
for the quarter to end-December, although inaccurate as a result of
false reporting by Mr Leeson, showed that the merchant bank's maximum
exposure had exceeded the UK central bank's 25% large exposures limit,
the report added.
It said the Bank of England and Barings' senior management had been
uncertain for about two years whether margins deposited with the Asian
exchanges were subject to the large exposures limit.
The report added: ''It had not been possible to inquire further into
why the Bank of England had not previously objected to exposures which
exceeded the large exposures limit because the Board of Banking
Supervision of the Bank of England declined to respond to a number of
queries that we raised, citing legal obstacles.''
However, the Bank of England said yesterday that there was nothing in
the Singapore report which invalidated the conclusions of its Board of
Banking Supervision, which published its report in July.
It added that it would be studying the Singapore document carefully.
The report, carried out for the Singapore Government by accountancy
major Price Waterhouse, said Barings chief executive officer Peter
Norris had tried to conceal unauthorised dealing by Mr Leeson and played
down its significance.
It alleged he was helped by James Bax, managing director of Barings
Futures Singapore, and group treasurer Anthony Hawes.
''In concealing the problem, Mr Norris was assisted by Mr Bax, who
tried to divert investigations by the external auditors, and Mr Hawes,''
the report added.
The team of government-appointed inspectors found severe shortcomings
in Baring's organisational and reporting structure, which allegedly
allowed Leeson to run up losses of $1320m (#839m) and led to the
merchant bank's collapse in February.
A Singapore Finance Ministry statement, which accompanied the report,
said inspectors found the fall of Barings Futures Singapore had been
caused by institutional incompetence, a lack of understanding of futures
business among senior executives, and a total failure of internal
controls.
At one point in their report, the inspectors referred to certain
claims by Barings executives as giving ''rise to a strong inference that
key individuals of the Barings Group's management were grossly
negligent, or wilfully blind and reckless to the truth''.
The Finance Ministry statement said Singapore's Commercial Affairs
Department had been instructed to study possible criminal acts by people
in Singapore and whether there were grounds to prosecute them.
The inspectors' report also said the Singapore International Monetary
Exchange was possibly too liberal in raising Barings' position limits.
After stepping down as chief executive officer, Mr Norris subsequently
resigned as an adviser to Barings on May 1 when Dutch-based banking
group ING, which acquired the remains of the 232-year-old Barings Bank,
fired 20 executives.
Mr Norris was also criticised by the Bank of England report on the
Barings debacle. It said he must bear ''ultimate responsibility.''
The Singapore Government has asked its Commercial Affairs Department,
the fraud squad, to study the Price Waterhouse findings. The department
is trying to get British-born Mr Leeson, 28, extradited from a jail near
Frankfurt in Germany.
A German court has ruled he can be extradited but Mr Leeson plans to
appeal against the decision.
He faces three charges of forgery and eight of fraud -- two against
Baring Futures (Singapore) and six against the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange. He could be imprisoned for up to 14 years.

GLASGOW-based Stakis is beating its major quoted competitors when it
comes to ''phenomenal'' growth in its hotel room rates, but a poor
showing by the group's casinos grabbed the City's attention.
Shares in Stakis yesterday lost 3p to 78p, after the company issued a
trading update for its fourth quarter to October 1.
The average room rate at Stakis's 41 hotels was up 8.3% on the same
quarter of the previous financial year at #45.06. This increase is more
than twice the current rate of inflation.
The fourth-quarter room occupancy rate also rose, from 78% to 79.6%.
However, on a like-for-like basis, the amount of cash exchanged for
betting chips in Stakis casinos was down #2.2m on the same three months
of the previous year. Comparing the 12 months to October 1 with the
previous reporting period, the like-for-like cash drop was down #4.3m.
With the win percentage for the 12 months at 18.2%, this shortfall in
the cash drop means Stakis's profits will be nearly #800,000 lower than
they would have been if the like-for-like drop had been maintained.
Although total casino attendances during the fourth quarter were up on
the same period of last year, partly reflecting three acquisitions in
the last year or so, the average spend per head fell from #134 to #128.
The fourth-quarter win percentage was only 17%.
However, referring to the fall in Stakis's share price, Simon Johnson,
leisure analyst at broker BZW Securities in London, said: ''One of the
things that was being passed over was just how phenomenally the hotels
were performing.''
With Stakis now having released trading details for the full year, Mr
Johnson is forecasting pre-tax profits of around #27m, an increase of
34% on the previous year's #20.2m.
Stakis will announce its full-year financials on December 12.
Chief executive David Michels was ''delighted that Stakis is
maintaining excellent progress on the hotel front''.
He added: ''I am obviously a bit disappointed with the casino cash
drop figure but one must keep it in perspective. I am more than
satisfied I can do something about pulling it back again.''
During the year to October 1, the average room rate was 5.5% higher
than in the previous 12 months at #43.94. An occupancy rate of 72.1%
compares favourably with one of 69.7% last time round, and the average
number of rooms increased from 3965 to 4630.
Casino attendances during the 12 months totalled 1.95 million, down
from 2.03 million the previous year. The total cash drop was #259.6m.
Stakis remains on the lookout for more hotels, either through
acquisitions or new-build projects. The 93-bedroom Glasgow City Hotel,
just off Buchanan Street, is a recent addition to the portfolio.
However, it is understood that Stakis is not currently considering the
acquisition of any other hotel group.
About two weeks ago, it scrapped the #2.50 admission charge for guests
of casino members, which was introduced only about 12 months ago.
This may have hit food and beverage takings, with guests who would
otherwise have gone to the casino for meals unwilling to pay this
additional charge.
The National Lottery has been cited by a wide variety of companies as
the reason for their particular trading setbacks.
However, a Stakis official yesterday resisted the temptation to lay
all of the blame for the disappointing casino performance at the door of
Camelot, believing it unreasonable to do so because of the impossibility
of measuring the Lottery's impact.
Meanwhile, Stakis will be looking for signs of moves towards a ''level
playing field'' in a Government green paper on the deregulation of
casinos which is expected this month.

PICTURE the scene: a seemingly tranquil area of Newfoundland coastline
menaced, on the left, by a creeping development of new housing and, on
the right, by a massive oil holding tank. Smack in the middle is a large
sign which reads ''Our coastline is natural and scenic. Why spoil the
look? Thank you for not littering.''
Obviously a case of closing the stable door after the horses have
bolted. The modern world has already encroached on that hitherto
untouched stretch of beautiful beach and all the local authority can do
about it is put up an ugly notice asking visitors to take their rubbish
home with them.
Ironic, yes; but in more ways than you may have guessed. Inquiring
environmental artist/photographer Marlene Creates dug deeper and
discovered that while that stretch of Newfoundland beach was undoubtedly
scenic, its rocky texture was anything but natural.
In days gone by the whole shoreline had been used, not for leisurely
strolls but for the business of fish drying and the women -- the wives
and widows of fishermen -- who carried out the work had, over the years,
hauled thousands upon thousands of rocks out of the water and covered
the sand with them to create a suitable drying surface.
On the beach, the artist fell into conversation with an elderly man
who no longer lived in the area but had returned for a brief holiday.
His own mother, it transpired, had once worked there, supervising the
fish drying. ''She was boss of the beaches,'' he told Creates.
A picture may be worth a thousand words -- but it doesn't always tell
the whole story. This artist urges all of us to look under the surface,
ask questions, see beyond the obvious.
In her exhibition, ''Language and Land Use, Newfoundland 1994'' at the
Collins Gallery of Strathclyde University in Richmond Street (until
Saturday), Marlene Creates uses simple displays of black and white
photographs, written observations, and objects taken from the scene (a
small pile of those very rocks, touched by fisherwomen in long black
dresses and sun bonnets; red carnations, like drops of blood, left by
protesters against a road building scheme) to tell the stories of the
public spaces she has visited and the people she met.

GRINDLEY Court Centre is a day centre for adults who have learning
disabilities, and it undertakes a number of projects throughout the
year, usually displayed in its gallery. Its most recent project, a
collaboration between two professional photographers, Margaret Mitchell
and Lucy Hicks, and eight individuals from the centre, uses experimental
types of photography to allow these individuals to explore parts of
their identities and personal desires.
The result is an exciting, professional, and humorous show, frank and
emotional. Restricted not only by Government rulings but also by public
prejudice these people have more problems than most of us but their
desires and dreams are just the same. Aileen Fender produces a record
cover and feature page to illustrate her desire for a singing career.
Dorothy McLeod has a witty montage of her imagined life -- home,
children, hobbies, and husband (ideally a policeman, looking like Jean
Luc Picard of Star Trek!), and three cyanotypes symbolically
representing her three wishes -- working in the police force, a normal
sex life, and children.
Humour is an obvious relief -- Ian Lyon's witty computer-manipulated
images shout his frustrations, but in a quirky, amusing manner. Ewan
Wright uses image transfers to create nine images of romance and
relationships, his own private hope.
All the work is powerful but perhaps Moira McLeod's is the best. A
self-portrait made up of overlapping frames, she has written her
feelings, likes, dislikes, and desires around her body, creating what is
almost a political statement.

THE Labour president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities
yesterday denied that a Scottish parliament as envisaged in the
convention's report would absorb powers from councils.
Mrs Rosemary McKenna acknowledged, however, that there would be
''tensions'' between the two layers of government.
Last week, local government expert Professor Arthur Midwinter, of
Strathclyde University, in his new book -- Local Government in Scotland:
Reform or Decline? -- warned that a Scottish Parliament would find it
difficult not to take over the major services of education, police, and
perhaps water, soon to be run by three quangos.
Conservative Ministers and some councillors have also warned that
local government would have to be on its guard against any interference
by an Edinburgh-based parliament.
However, speaking in Glasgow, Mrs McKenna commented: ''I am very
confident we will have a completely new relationship with the Scottish
parliament.
''There will be tensions. There always will be but at least we will be
involved in the debate.''
She claimed there would never again be a situation where something was
imposed, such as the current removal of water services from council
control, despite the opposition of the vast majority of Scots.
STUC general secretary Campbell Christie said Professor Midwinter was
talking ''with the full lack of knowledge which we expect on some
occasions from people talking about these issues''.
He insisted that local government would be strengthened as a result of
the importance attached by the proposals to the subsidiarity principle.
The Constitutional Convention report stresses it will be vital that
the relationship between the parliament and local authorities is
positive and co-operative.
It also makes it clear the new parliament will decide on any future
restructuring of local government.

What powers it will have
THE Scottish parliament's powers will include all areas of policy
currently within the remit of the Scottish Office. Matters of defence,
foreign affairs, immigration, nationality, social security policy, and
central economic and fiscal responsibilities will remain to be decided
by the Westminster Parliament.
The Act setting up the Scottish parliament will embody the principle
of subsidiarity which, as stated at the start of the Maastricht Treaty,
requires that decisions be taken as closely as possible to the citizens
affected by those decisions.
Where a function is shared between the Scottish parliament and
Westminster, the Act will provide that the respective responsibilities
will be decided in accordance with the subsidiarity principle and by
agreement between the two parliaments.
The Scottish parliament, for example, will have responsibility for the
distinctive Scottish education system. It will also oversee and
legislate for the separate Scottish legal system, courts, and police.
According to the report, it will be able to judge and reflect
Scotland's priorities with regard to improving health or housing or
community care.
It will have powers to generate industrial development, to promote
investment in Scotland, and to develop industries such as agriculture,
fisheries, forestry, and tourism.
On a topical note, the parliament's responsibilities will cover the
distribution of National Lottery proceeds through appropriate agencies
or the prospects for enhancing the Scottish film industry.
Subject to EU regulations and international agreements, the parliament
will also have powers to control pollution, to protect the environment,
to conserve the countryside, and to look after historic buildings.
The parliament will be represented in British ministerial delegations
to the EU Council of Ministers, where appropriate, and Scottish
Ministers will lead these delegations when the areas under discussion
are of specific relevance to Scotland. It is essential the parliament
sets up a representative office in Brussels.
Where funding will come from
THE Scottish parliament will receive a block of funding from
Westminster which will continue to be based on the Barnett Formula for
assessing Scottish needs. This means the parliament will be guarantedd
its income on a long-term, stable basis which will not require annual
negotiation, says the report.
The financial settlement will be based on a continuation of the
principle of equalisation of expenditure within Britain.
Scotland's parliament will also have the power to increase or cut the
basic rate of income tax for Scottish taxpayers by a maximum of 3p in
the pound.
The report stresses that any tax cuts will have to be financed from
within its assigned budget. So if Scotland wanted to have tax cuts, it
would have to pay for them. Similarly, if the parliament wanted to raise
taxes in Scotland, it would be able to keep the revenues for itself.
The report adds: ''That such a power will exist does not mean that it
will necessarily be used. If the parliament uses the power to vary the
rate of income tax, it will be held to account for its decision by the
electorate.
''It is therefore a power which is unlikely to be used without a great
deal of caution and prudence.''
The parliament will have autonomy over how it spends its budget and
will be able to determine its priorities for public expenditure. The
report states: ''Decisions about government spending in Scotland will no
longer be directed by Scottish Office Ministers who lack popular
support.''
According to the convention, ''the cost of Scottish democracy will
certainly be no more than the current cost of government in Scotland''.
At yesterday's launch of the report, however, no-one was prepared to
put an actual price on the running costs of the new parliament.
The report stresses that the parliament will have the power to set
about replacing many of the quangos which ''blight'' Scottish political
life, placing their functions under the control of elected
representatives.
How the elections will work
THE Scottish parliament will have 129 members.
In the report, there is a commitment to a parliament ''whose
membership reflects the regional diversity of its communities, one in
which men and women are fairly represented in numbers broadly
proportionate to their shares of the population''.
Each elector will be entitled to cast two votes -- the first for a
constituency member of the Scottish parliament. There will be 73
constituency MSPs elected from constituencies corresponding to the
existing constituencies of the Westminster Parliament. The exception is
that Orkney and Shetland will become two separate constituencies. These
MSPs will be elected on the present ''first past the post system''.
The second vote will be for a local party or group list of additional
members. There will be 56 additional members in all -- seven from each
of eight constituencies which will correspond with the present eight
European parliamentary constituencies.
To counter criticisms of this list system, the report says the name of
the individual representatives on the party/group list will be detailed
on the ballot paper and published before the election.
The votes cast for each party or group will be counted within the
eight constituencies and the seven seats from each will be allocated so
that the total representation from each area, including MSPs returned
for individual constituencies, will correspond as closely as possible
with the share of the vote cast for each party in the area.
Regular reviews should be held to establish the success of the system
in fulfilling the objectives of the convention.
Equal representation of men and women
ONE of the key principles of the Constitutional Convention's vision is
that there should be equal representation of men and women in the
Scottish parliament.
The report states: ''We believe that a new Scottish parliament is a
great opportunity to radically improve the representation of women in
Scottish politics. Locally and nationally, women have been persistantly
under-represented in Scotland but the new parliament should represent
the whole community and reflect more sympathetically the priorities of
the people of Scotland.''
In order to achieve this, the convention endorses the cross-party
agreement between Labour and the Liberal Democrats which accepts the
principle that there should be an equal number of men and women as
members of the first Scottish parliament.
It commits the parties to take into account both the constituency and
additional member list candidates to select and field an equal number of
male and female candidates for election and to ensure that these
candidates are fairly distributed with a view to the ''winability'' of
seats.
The convention calls on the other parties, notably the Tories and the
SNP, to follow suit and implement the principles of this agreement. No
legal enforcement, however, is planned and the report accepts that a
parliament with an equal representation of men and women may not be
achieved.
The planned process of review and amendment of the electoral system
should then come into play to address the situation.
Business hours
IT is planned that the Scottish parliament will go about its business
in a way which is very different from the Westminster model.
Although it is proposed the four-year-term parliament should be based
in Edinburgh, the new body will vary the location of its meetings and
work to normal business hours.
Membership of the Scottish parliament will be considered a full-time
appointment, according to the report. It will, therefore, not be
possible for its members also to serve at Westminster or in the European
Parliament, except in the initial transitional period.
The administration will be headed by a Chief Minister who will
normally, but not necessarily, be the leader of the largest party in the
parliament. He or she will have to be confirmed in the post by a simple
majority of the full parliament.
Cabinet membership will be drawn from the party or parties which can
form a working majority in the parliament.
The report says the Constitutional Convention is committed to
delivering a parliament of a new type and expects methods of operation
which ensure ''openness, responsiveness, accessibility, and
accountability''.
For example, it want electors to be able to petition the parliament
directly.
Parliament would also operate through a system of powerful committees
which could initiate legislation as well as scrutinise and amend
Government proposals and which would have wide-ranging investigative
functions.
The future
THE Scottish Constitutional Commission concluded that, in theory under
Britain's unwritten constitution, the Act establishing the Scottish
parliament could be repealed or amended by the Westminster Parliament.
However, the Constitutional Convention believes that, in fact, this
would not happen. The report states it is firmly of the view that
''through widespread recognition of the parliament's legitimate
authority both within Scotland and internationally, such a course of
action is both practically and politically impossible''.
It goes on to stress, however, that some form of entrenchment should
be attempted and suggests the Westminster Parliament should give a clear
commitment through a declaration that the Act founding the Scottish
parliament should not be repealed or amended in such a way as to
threaten its existence without the consent of the Scottish parliament
and the Scottish people sought through an election or a referendum.
Provision should be made for disputes about the relative powers of the
Westminster and Scottish parliaments to be resolved by a House of Lords
committee or the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

A SCOTTISH parliament would ''kill separatism stone dead'', the shadow
Scottish Secretary said yesterday.
Mr George Robertson hailed the convention plans as ''a unique design''
which would strengthen the Union.
Mr James Wallace, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said: ''No doubt
we will face scaremongering, mis-representation, and downright lies,''
but the proposals offered ammunition to rebut the critics.
However, the plans were attacked by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
who claimed such a parliament would wreck the Scottish economy and
destabilise the constitution.
Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, was also quick to step forward.
The SNP had no doubt the assembly would be a puppet ''dancing on the
end of a Westminster string'' as Mrs Margaret Ewing, Parliamentary
leader, put it.
Westminster would be able to water down its powers or scrap it
altogether, said Mr Salmond. He also claimed the convention had
retreated on its earlier financial proposals of 1990.
Instead of asking for the Scottish income tax and VAT take to be
allocated to Edinburgh, it had settled for basically the current block
grant arrangement on which the Scottish Office operates.
Mr Robertson said the popularity of the Scottish parliament would
protect it against weakening or abolition. He added that a Labour
Government would seek from Parliament a declaration that the Scottish
parliament could not be repealed or weakened without the consent of both
itself and Scottish voters in a referendum or General Election.
He said: ''A Scottish parliament will make a huge difference to the
lives of millions of ordinary Scots. With powers over health, housing,
local government, education, and every other key area of domestic
activity, it will bring democracy back to Scotland.
''A Scottish Office run by four Ministers and a party that can only
manage 12% of the vote in this year's elections, 5000 quango
appointments, employing over 15,000 civil servants and spending
#14,000m, will now come under democratic control.''
He assured several sceptical journalists the financial arrangements
would not mean an annual negotiation of the money Scotland received from
the Westminster Treasury, arguing that what is known as the Barnett
Formula would remain in place.
Mr Robertson said the power to vary income tax up or down was exactly
that, a ''power''.
''There is no tartan tax,'' he said. It would be for each political
party to declare in its election manifesto if it planned to raise extra
revenue or cut tax.
''The Scottish people will pay no extra tax unless they vote to do
so,'' he added.
He denied there would be any interference by Westminster in the
parliament's work, although disputes about jurisidiction would have to
be determined on a judicial not political bias by a body such as the
Apellate Committee of the House of Lords or the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council.
Mr Wallace said the Parliament would be fairly elected ''so that no
single party or region will be able to dominate -- it will be a
parliament for all Scotland''.
He said it was hoped to achieve gender balance in the first parliament
and called on non-convention parties like the Conservatives and the SNP
to co-operate in achieving this.
Detailed drafting of a Bill to be presented by a Labour Government
cannot get under way until civil servants are able to offer advice and
help to the main opposition party from January 1.
In the Commons, the Prime Minister said ''there is no doubt whatsoever
that those policies, if carried out as at present intended, would have a
very damaging effect on the United Kingdom''.

THE inhabitants of the more remote areas of Scotland have always been
less enthusiastic about an Edinburgh parliament than their counterparts
in the central belt.
Many perceive little to choose between rule by a Labour-dominated
assembly in the capital, which they fear will be cast in the image of
Strathclyde Regional Council, and rule by a Conservative Government in
Westminster.
Neither body, in the view of many rural dwellers, truly cares or
legislates for their needs. As yet, the Constitutional Convention's
electoral proposals and their implications have filtered through to very
few prospective voters.
Nevertheless, the proposals are significant, introducing for the first
time an element of proportional representation to our electoral system.
Orkney and Shetland have been lobbying for separate representation and
have, therefore, welcomed the proposals which give them each a
representative in parliament.
However, Scotland's other islands authority, the Western Isles Islands
Council, has also called for a second representative. The council's
convener, Mr Donald Mackay, said the gut reaction to a Scottish
parliament was still fear of central belt domination.
Nevertheless, he was ''reasonably encouraged'' by recent reforms by
the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to give greater prominence
to the needs of more rural or remote councils.
''We want to safeguard the islands' dimension because we have
different problems. If it is a matter of substituting something in the
central belt for something in London, we will be no better off,'' he
said.
Orkney Islands Council will meet today to discuss its strategy for
seeking greater autonomy under a Scottish parliament -- aims it may well
pursue with the two other islands councils.
It will also seek to re-establish principles first laid down by the
famous Liberal MP for Orkney and Shetland, Mr Jo Grimmond, that
machinery be set up to ensure that legislation is responsive to the
needs of island communities.
The Shetland Islands Council's representative on the convention,
Councillor Tavish Scott, a Liberal-Democrat, believes the package is
sufficient to overcome concerns of central belt domination.
''The country has changed and Shetland has changed, so I suspect that
these are arguments are not as relevant now as they were.
Proportionality and the extra member, I believe, will assuage these
fears,'' he said.
In Grampian, the Provost of Gordon District Council and depute
convener of the new Aberdeen Council, Mr Raymond Bisset, said he had yet
to be convinced by the reforms by Cosla to give more rural
representation and, therefore, also that a Scottish parliament would
break the tradition of central belt domination.
Mr Peter Peacock, the vice-convener of Highland Regional Council,
warned it was inevitable any system of proportional representation would
work against independent politicians, who for so long have been a
mainstay of rural politics.
''If independents wish to remain in politics, they will have to align
themselves or form some alternative party,'' he said.
His colleague, Councillor David Green, an independent who represents
Achiltibuie and will be vice-convener of the new Highland Council, said
representation should not be decided on a population basis because of
the special needs of rural areas.
Lord Minto, convener of Borders Regional Council, said he had
encountered both ignorance and apathy over the issue. However, he did
not rule out the possibility that the central belt might dominate a
Scottish parliament to the detriment of the Borders.

FAMOUS as much for learning dancing from Margaret Morris, being the
wife of J D Fergusson and for her associations with Robert Colquhoun and
Robert MacBryde, Pat Douthwaite's life is enthralling. Her work,
unencumbered by conventional training, portrays all emotional levels,
with layers of meaning and stories hidden inside each painting.
A recent visit to Peru has renewed an interest in skeletons and death:
Death Bed has a threatening death head looming over the stricken figure,
harshly outlined in thick black. Certain images recur -- in Crucifixion,
Green Hold-Ups, and even In a Gwenjohn Hat, the head is covered or
cropped away completely, with brutal intent.
The dominating reds in her series Two Men speak of anger and mistrust,
while her preoccupation with eyes, large and intensely coloured,
suggests the old analogy of eyes as windows to the soul. Described as a
gentler show, her works are still powerful and disturbing, the
distortions and exaggerations in her figures intense and unnerving.
The gallery also has an impressive display of salt-glazed ceramics by
some of the best practitioners of this exciting medium. An unpredictable
process, salt is thrown at the pot while firing and this challenge
attracts both the impulsive and the manipulative potter.
Michael Casson is an acknowledged master whose use of sponge, comb,
and finger wiping produces unique, robust stonewear, while Stuart
Whatley's pieces reflect the colours and light of Skye, where he is
based. Walter Keeler's black and cobalt jugs with set-back tops and
overlapping handles are uniquely artistic and functional.

Theatre
IT'S heartening to see there are still people who are daft enough to
go it alone for the love of their craft. Prime Productions' Chekhov
anthology is the first in a series of shows being programmed in a back
room in the city-centre Cafe Royal from now until early in the New Year
and perhaps beyond.
It's barely more than a few rows of chairs lined up before a raised
platform, but the same spirit has kept the Fringe going for 50 years, so
there's no reason it shouldn't work here.
I wish I could raise the same amount of enthusiasm for Splinters, a
collection of Chekhov's satirical stories from the Russian magazine of
the same name, put together and reworked for the stage by actor John
Shedden.
Performed by Shedden and Finlay McLean, it's a series of cameo pieces
about ordinary people, teachers, bank clerks, small-time lawyers, who
are gently sent up for their foibles, hypocrisy or weakness for a drink.
Striving to be a celebration of the quirks of human life, its level of
humour is rarely more than clumsy and does little to dispel the myth
that Chekhov was just another morose Russian artist. Certainly it
doesn't justify the enthusiasm of the linking passages in which the
actors sing the author's praises as a lively man-about-town.
This will always be the material of warm amusement rather than
out-and-out comedy, but while there is nothing particularly to fault in
Shedden and McLean's rounded actorly performances, the whole thing would
benefit from a more robust character-acting style that perhaps paid less
attention to the period setting and more to giving Chekhov's
observations an air of fresh insight.

AND so the divine Ms G got unplugged and let her roots show. This tour
is distinctive for two reasons: first, it is billed as an ''acoustic
retrospective''; secondly the artist does not have a new album to
promote.
Last night's show was all about enjoyment for Nanci Griffith. Music
for the sheer hell of it. Her choice from a sumptuous back catalogue,
lapped up by an adoring audience.
She was liberated from the pressure to punt, and we were treated to a
seamless blend of old, new, and borrowed.
Early classics like It's A Hard Life, Once In A Very Blue Moon, and
Gulf Coast Highway; a healthy swatch from her most recent studio album
Flyer, along with an impressive new song, Two for the Road; and covers
of Dylan and John Pine favourites.
The blue element would normally have been provided by her backing
band, but on this occasion the Blue Moon Orchestra was pared down to
Half Moon status.
This allowed Griffith's swooping, soaring, Texan vocal chords to
dominate proceedings and the Usher Hall acoustics did her proud.
The highlights were a bilingual version of From a Distance (due to
feature in the opening ceremony of next year's Olympics at Atlanta) and
her final number, an unaccompanied rendition of The Road to Aberdeen.
It was beautiful and it was factual. Griffith appears at the city's
alternative festival tomorrow night. Do anything legal to get a ticket.

Bert McCann describes a Scots influence in Ulster's reconciliation
WHEN the history of the Northern Ireland peace negotiations comes to
be written it is to be hoped that the many people and organisations who
laid the foundations on which the present ceasefire has been built will
be accorded proper recognition.
Over the past 10 years a number of initiatives have taken place away
from the glare of the television lights and the probing of the world's
press which have led the way out of the impasse and on to the threshold
of a lasting, peaceful settlement.
One such peace pioneer has a strong Scottish connection. Quintin
Oliver is the director of the Belfast-based Northern Ireland Council for
Voluntary Action, itself a close cousin of our own Scottish Council for
Voluntary Organisations.
Oliver, originally from East Belfast and the son of liberal
middle-class parents, left his native shores in the mid-1970s and like
many who went before him never expected to return.
After graduating from St Andrews University in 1977 where he was a
contemporary of Michael Forsyth and Alex Salmond he went on to become
the driver/adviser on Strathclyde Region's first Welfare Benefits Bus
which advised claimants from Fort William to Ferniegair. This and other
bold ideas released millions of pounds of unpaid and underclaimed
welfare benefits.
After leading Strathclyde's welfare rights team for a spell, Quintin
Oliver returned to his roots, becoming director of NICVA in 1985. The
organisation was originally set up in 1938 as a response to mass
unemployment and in practice served as a device for defusing discontent
and sapping the will of the people.
By the 1970s it had lost its way, having detached itself from local
communities, been marginalised by the troubles, and was generally
perceived as being liberal Unionist in political tone.
Quintin Oliver's return to Northern Ireland in 1985 marked an
important confluence of ideas, as around that time community groups felt
in need of an organisational resource and had decided to combine and
revive the NICVA network.
This was a notion which accorded with the new director's thinking.
Oliver had an important advantage in that having been away ''over over
water'' for several years he had no political baggage and was presented
with a clean sheet on which to write.
He recalls: ''It was obvious that NICVA had to change in every
respect. We moved the office, from the leafy glades of South Belfast
into the inner city, and injected a dose of community development
practice. This included consultation with local groups and returning to
the people an organisation which should have been theirs in the first
place.''
Once that policy was established the discussion moved in 1987 to
considering how to shift Northern Ireland society from a sectarian to a
non-sectarian polity. Huge changes in attitude were required within
NICVA and in the communities with which it was involved.
In time the voluntary sector started to fill a political vacuum and
had become an intellectual powerhouse drawing together the positive
voices from the trade unions, the arts, local goverment, and the
churches.
In the Nationalist communities political debate had been going on for
some time leading to the emergence of such figures as Sinn Fein's
Mitchel McLaughlin as an influential political leader. Meanwhile, on the
Loyalist side around 1991 ex-prisoners Billy Hutchison and David Irvine
emerged as community activists.
The forums which NICVA had set up were a ready-made arena in which the
antagonists could talk about their differences and identify issues which
the opposing communities had in common such as poor housing,
unemployment and benefit cuts. It could be argued that the present peace
is to an extent the culmination of this process.

James Freeman highlights prison service unease at a barrage of
'vote-catching' interference.
WHEN Michael Forsyth arrived back off the London shuttle he inherited
a prison system which was enjoying a rare period of stability and
visible progress.
A cautious feeling had arisen that at last some of the hard rethinking
which took place in the immediate aftermath of the riots and hostage
takings of the late 80s and early years of this decade was beginning to
be translated into action in the form of coherent programmes aimed at
helping jailed criminals come to grips with their offending.
The big idea was that propounded by the document, ''Opportunity and
Responsibility'' -- we will give you the opportunities inside prison to
tackle your problems provided you take responsibility for your actions.
The importance of families as an essential part of the equation, the
idea of resocialising men who had been out of society -- quite rightly
-- often for very lengthy periods, had been recognised.
Open prison, designed so that criminals reaching the end of very long
sentences could be tested outside before returning fully to the
community, was given a new emphasis. The lack of such open facilities
for women in Scotland was pinpointed and is now being addressed.
Areas of offending previously regarded as unfruitful or as unlikely to
yield any meaningful results in terms of preventing or reducing
reoffending, notably sexual offending, have been tackled with a will.
The commitment and the investment of their own lives and personalities
by the staff involved in such programmes as those at Peterhead and
Shotts prisons in working with this dangerous and damaged group of
offenders should never be underestimated by the public.
At the front end of the system the brand-new Shotts Induction Unit,
dubbed irreverently in the prison service as the arrival lounge, has
been designed to take in men who have just received long sentences from
the High Courts and who face the next decade at least behind bars. They
are being helped to come to terms with that prospect, the aim being to
prevent them becoming the embittered and intractable troublemakers of
the future.
The legacy of the Barlinnie Special Unit is being worked through at a
number of small, specialised units where dangerous or volatile men can
be dealt with away from the mainstream in which they have in the past
proved to be the ringleaders in the violent disturbances.
But all these initiatives, and many others like them, require careful,
structured approaches. They are the result of experience, often bitter
experience, being applied thoughtfully. While in the past, even the
recent past, the Scottish prisons were run on old-fashioned,
militaristic lines which had changed little since the war and which
entailed a judicious measure of brutality and fear, once the dinosaurs
were swept away by the riots and the management modernised the major
constraint on progress was lack of investment.
The arrival of Forsyth appears to have signalled an end to lack of
resources as an abiding problem. Practically his first act was
significantly to speed up the plan for Scotland's first private prison,
which, although it is to be built, run, and maintained under the private
finance initiative, will have significant cost implications for the
Scottish Prison Service and hence the taxpayer.
The SPS will need it and need it fast because Forsyth then signalled
that he intended to scrap the existing early-release programmes, whereby
a prisoner could earn time off his sentence for good behaviour, and
bring in a new deal greatly reducing the available remission. The
current system, the result of a careful, well-structured report by Lord
Kincraig, one of our most notable High Court judges, has therefore
lasted only two years.
Once again the idea was to inhibit reoffending, prisoners serving up
to four years being released at half sentence but serving the other half
under supervision in the community. For longer-term prisoners remission
for good behaviour remained the same at two-thirds. The Kincraig rules
have plainly never been given the chance to show their worth or lack of
it.
One of the recent successes of the Scottish prison system has been the
HIV-testing programmes which have formed the basis of the current range
of drug rehabilitation efforts in the jails, but here again Mr Forsyth's
weighty hand is being felt. In at least two major prisons there are
waiting-lists of men seeking help. But the HIV testing went further.
Carried out on a voluntary, anonymous basis, the questionnaires
completed by very high percentages of Scottish prisoners when they
provided saliva tests presented researchers -- and Scottish society --
with a clearer picture of injecting behaviour and HIV in communities
across Scotland. The spread of HIV through the prison ''bridge'' was,
and is, recognised as a major problem, so knowledge was invaluable.
All these initiatives appear to be in jeopardy to a greater or lesser
degree, however, and the source of the danger is Forsyth himself. His
predecessor, Ian Lang, interfered very little with the operational
aspects of prisons, wisely leaving that to the professionals. There
seemed little doubt that agency status concentrated the minds of those
professionals and in the past year -- prior to Forsyth's arrival --
every one of the performance targets was met.
In direct contrast to England, escapes were minimal, assaults from all
sides were down, costs were contained, and for the first time in a
decade there were no riot or hostage-taking incidents in our jails.
The first victim of Forsyth could be prison costs, and consequently
our pockets. Should he hack back on remission, both short and long-term
prisoners will remain inside for years more, each day costing between
#70 and #80, each year in excess of #26,000 per head. The new hard line
arrives precisely at the point the Treasury is warning of the
toughest-ever round of public spending bargaining, so it will be
interesting to see what is cut back to bolster Forsyth's
tough-on-law-and-order credentials.
Where are the millions to come from? By signalling the move to random
mandatory drug testing, Forsyth was simply following in the footsteps of
Mr Howard in England. Previous research has shown that drug-taking in
Scottish jails is not nearly as prevalent as tabloid journalists would
have us believe, but it was plain from the outset that Forsyth's number
one priority was to satisfy some of the tabloids, his two mouthpieces in
Scotland, and to get the others off his back.
There has been considerable reaction inside the jails to the
announcement, a groundswell of unease. It is never wise to overemphasise
these matters since they can be self-fulfilling, yet it is equally wrong
to ignore what has happened as a consequence of Forsyth's direct
interference. While the first victim of that initiative was the
voluntary HIV-testing programme, the researchers telling The Herald it
was a waste of public money to carry on, there could yet be other
consequences.
It is this need to respond to the tabloids which is the most
regrettable manifestation of Forsyth's concentration on the prisons
since his return. It was the only field open to him where he could
really demonstrate how tough he was, the police, the courts, and the
justiciary being out of bounds. The recent senior management conference
of the SPS at Peebles was abuzz with stories of prison headquarters
suffering each morning under the Forsyth lash; what does this headline
mean, is that tabloid story true and if so how could that happen?
Even the most outrageous tabloid excesses, including the absurd and
irresponsible story in Forsyth's Scottish mouthpiece that 50 weapons,
including axes and knives, had been found in Glenochil Prison prior to
the cancelled visit of the Princess Royal, have had to be explained. The
newspaper had not even checked its ''facts'' with the prison service
before publishing.
When another tabloid brayed that the actor Eric Cullen, who admitted
child indecency charges, was receiving preferential treatment in
Barlinnie, the story goes that Forsyth was on the phone first thing
demanding an explanation. In fact the prison management were guilty only
of taking very necessary and correct precautions to safeguard a
vulnerable individual at risk of suicide or assault by other prisoners.
Senior management at the SPS have closed ranks and are keeping a
dignified silence about the barrage of interference. The only departure
from this was the sweeping attack on the press at the prisons
conference, friend and foe alike suffering, by Edward Frizzell, the SPS
chief executive, and which, sadly, was justified in most cases.
The feeling is around the criminal justice system that there is much
to be gained if prisons management here keeps its collective nerve.
Mandatory drug testing may, for example, prove to be a non-event.
Tabloid attempts to damage rehabilitation efforts or
training-for-freedom programmes in a desperate bid for newspaper sales
at any cost may yet peter out.
Damage by naked political interference in a blatant attempt to catch
votes, inflicting a dose of nasty medicine which may be necessary in
England but is of doubtful value here, may be longer-term and harder to
rectify.

Dance
THERE are moments during Siobhan Davies' newest work, The Art of
Touch, when neither the ear nor the eye can quite believe the sheer,
exuberant speed of things -- the rapid, flickering fingering in the
Scarlatti sonatas, the rapid, flickering footwork, gestures, intricate
patterning of the dance.
As ever, there are all kinds of interconnecting thread within the
piece that make you long to run it over -- maybe even in slow motion --
just to savour the cleverness of the mosaic and the everyday, human
relevance of the individual skeins of movement.
For just as the crisp flurries of the Scarlatti test and exercise the
flexibility and sensitivity of the musician's touch, so Davies'
choreography explores, and exercises, how we touch others, how we
connect with other people, and with the space around us.
There are electric moments when the dancers' bodies flex and shift
through what seems like the entire spectrum of physical articulation, as
if they were learning what will give -- moving, too, as if invisible
strings connected them to the fierce, fast ripplings on the keyboard.
And at the same time, there is a voyage of reaching out, sequences of
doublework where courtly mannerisms -- an airy one-two shake of the hand
-- precede hands-on contact that ranges from a hand clasp to a fully
supportive lift at, for instance, the hip.
A couple will suddenly waltz -- or shimmy into a bright jive that fits
brilliantly with the music. At other times the full ensemble of seven
will pause, as if assimilating body language before linking arms like a
row of black sylphs -- the almost ballerina-esque gauze skirts of the
women wittily picking up on Davies' rare use, these days, of a classical
composer (albeit with contemporary extensions by Matteo Fargion).
And though the prevailing hues are black and grey, there are
occasional shafts of brilliant light, and a bronzing glow across the set
that seem to echo the human warmth that can suffuse our bleakest days
when meaningful touch occurs.
This is an extraordinarily rich, complex piece that radiates utterly
captivating energy -- danced, as one has come to expect, with unaffected
brio.
Wild Translations made this a perfect double bill, a second sighting
simply reinforcing its finer points.
How I wish the company were still in Edinburgh so as those who missed
it could catch up on an evening of unalloyed creative mastery.

LARNACA: One of three British soldiers accused of kidnapping and
killing a young Danish woman in Cyprus told a court yesterday that he
was punched and kicked by police. Private Justin Fowler, 27, was
testifying for the first time in an argument over the admissibility of
prosecution evidence.
Defence lawyers say the defendants' arrest by Cypriot police was
unlawful, making incriminating evidence found in their car inadmissible.
Fowler and fellow defendants Pte Alan Ford, 27, and Pte Jeff Parnell,
24, deny charges of manslaughter, kidnapping, and conspiracy to rape
Miss Jensen in September last year.

Rome
ITALY'S Interior Minister said today that police were taking seriously
concern that the Mafia might launch a missile attack on a Palermo
courthouse where former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti is on trial.
Minister Giovanni Coronas said in a written reply to an MP that fears
that the Sicilian mob planned an act of violence during the trial were
''not without foundation''.
Andreotti's trial began on September 26.
''In recent years, weapons and munition of every type and notable
quantities of explosives have been found in the possession of members of
organised crime groups,'' Coronas said.
He said investigators had also discovered that Mafia boss Leoluca
Bagarella had assembled a large quantity of lethal weapons just before
his arrest last June.
Italian media reported in July that a Mafia turncoat had testified
that Bagarella had ordered the killing of Palermo's top anti-Mafia judge
Giancarlo Caselli.
One report said the bomb was going to be smuggled into the heavily
fortified courthouse on board an ambulance.
''For these reasons, on September 27, given the start of the trial,
the Department of Public Safety notified Palermo's prefect and public
prosecutor and the commanders of the Carabinieri (police force) and
finance police of the danger of potential Mafia attacks,'' Coronas said.
He said security was increased at the white marble courthouse in the
centre of Palermo where most anti-Mafia prosecutors work.
Andreotti, 76, seven times Italy's Prime Minister, is on trial on
charges he was the Mafia's protector in Rome's corridors of power. He
denies the charges.--Reuter.

CREDIT where it's due. The Law Diary often has an unkind word for
judges whose contact with the real world is somewhat tenuous, but that
accusation certainly couldn't be levelled at Lord McCluskey.
In producing his considered opinion in the case involving a book about
Wet Wet Wet, his lordship revealed that not only had he heard of the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones -- no bonus points there even for a
member of the judiciary -- but also Marti Pellow and his musical mates,
which is a bit more impressive.
But the Dead Kennedys? How many judges could have come up with the
name of an early US punk-rock group?
Sore point?
OUT of mouths of babes and Court of Session Macers? A case was called
over the Parliament House tannoy the other day, apparently involving Her
Majesty's Secretary of State for Trade and Injury.
Making his mark
AN interesting review of Lord Stott's latest literary effort ''Judge's
Diary'' appeared in a recent edition of the Scots Law Times. The
reviewer, W J Stewart, took the volume on holiday with him and found it
entertaining.
He says: ''On my return, it occurred to me that it could have been
reviewed by the reviewer of the first volume, Lord Advocate's Diary''
(who was in fact regular law page contributor, Sheriff Andrew Lothian).
''But by this time the book had collected so much sand and was so
marked by gin and tonic stains,'' continues Mr Stewart, ''that I knew it
would look out of place in Sheriff Lothian's library.''
Bastions of the
law (No 77)
THE nagging thorn in the Government's side during the passage of the
Children's Scotland Act had an earlier career in Inverness . . . inside
Porterfield Prison.
An inmate once asked prison social worker Jamie Erskine if he was a
Lord: ''I said yes, and the next question was what are you doing in this
dump?''
In April last year he succeeded to the title of the Earl of Mar and
Kellie, as premier viscount in Scotland and hereditary keeper of
Stirling Castle.
Erskine, now 46, is the only member of the House of Lords with
hands-on experience at the ermine-free end of life as a dogsbody social
worker, apart from the redoubtable Tory octogenarian, Baroness Lucy
Faithfull.
He couldn't have arrived at a more opportune time with the passage of
important legislation on Scottish local government, mental health, and
children's welfare.
Erskine, a Liberal Democrat, watched its progress carefully with
Labour colleagues Donald Macaulay and Neil Carmichael. They had been
well briefed by 80 child care agencies. He tried unsuccessfully to
include annual HMI inspections of public schools on the grounds that the
poor devils forced to endure them were entitled to just as much
protection as any other child.
That and 49 amendments were withdrawn, but only after pledges that
matters raised would be incorporated in guidance when the Act was
enforced.
''I think we got what wanted, if not in statute, then through
guidance. Overall, I was quite satisfied whith the assurances we got out
of the Government,'' he said.
For independent schools there is now at least clear understanding of
the role of HMIs to review and investigate complaints, although he still
has concern about the vulnerability of overseas children in the system.
It was at Eton that he decided on social work as career, which
included training at Moray House and varied posts in York, Craigmillar,
Sheffield, Grampian and Inverness.
''Most social work is totally bound up in statute, and it has been
interesting. I must spend more time talking about social work in the
House of Lords than I ever got the chance to when I was doing it.''
The Children's Act went through in the wake of the Civil Evidence
(Family Mediation) Scotland Act, a private member's bill sponsored by
Baroness Carnegy of Lour, which renders anything said in mediation
sessions for divorced and separating parents inadmissible as evidence in
later civil proceedings.
At a time of severe disquiet over how Westminster deals with Scottish
legislation, it is heartening to know that the Lords is not entirely
populated by genetically challenged old duffers. And maybe they can get
our Acts together in the context of the real world outside.

Olongapo
A ROMAN Catholic priest said today he helped gather evidence against a
Briton accused of promoting child sex tours in the Philippines because
he was offended by the way Filipina girls were being portrayed.
The Rev Shay Cullen, testifying against Michael Clarke, a travel agent
from Eastbourne, Sussex, told the court he took a picture of a poster,
showing pornographic scenes, in a house where the Briton was staying.
The photograph was among evidence presented on the second day of the
trial in Olongapo City, 50 miles west of Manila, where Clarke was
arrested June 5.
Also produced was a brochure allegedly distributed by Clark in London
to promote a tour package that included a drive to ''Sin City'' and the
''OK Corral'', where ''dozens of headstrong young fillies are tethered''
and presented to clients, who are told to ''choose your mount''.
The brochure identifies 57-year-old Clarke as managing director of
Paradise Express, based in Eastbourne.
''I was quite disgusted and shocked that the Filipino women were
described as animals tied in a corral where customers were brought and
would mount them,'' Father Cullen said.
Father Cullen, a campaigner against prostitution in Olongapo, heads
the Preda Foundation, a child-care centre, and is a member of a Justice
Department task force monitoring child abuse.
Another brochure offered help to foreigners ''with good character and
regular employment (age unimportant)'' to find a Filipina wife.
The hearing continues.

Allan Masson warns of the serious financial implications for employers
who dispose of staff without considering the key factors of fairness and
planning.
'THESE are the last of the letters, Mr McDonald, and your wife rang
again. Will there be anything else tonight?'' ''No thank you Agnes --
oh, by the way . . . I'm afraid that I've not been very pleased with the
standard of your work recently and so I've arranged for a new girl to
start on Monday. So I'll not be needing you again after tomorrow.''
''But Mr McDonald, you've never said anything to me about my work and
nor did Mr Scott when I worked for him, and I've been with the company
for almost three years now!''
''Well, yes, Agnes. That's as may be but times are hard. I'm afraid
that my mind is made up on that.''
If you are an employer or a manager with responsibility for staff, you
may recognise this scenario -- or worse, you may even think that it is
quite acceptable. If so, think again!
Mr McDonald, or his employer, is now heading at high speed for an
industrial tribunal and somewhere soon a lawyer, or other adviser, is
going to be telling Agnes that she has a good case and that he feels
confident that she can win.
If Agnes is unable to find alternative employment quickly (and there
is no guarantee that she will) Mr McDonald might be looking at the thick
end of #2000 or more by way of compensation for unfair dismissal.
The foregoing scenario is, unfortunately, not just a piece of fiction
but one which is played out all too often in companies throughout the
UK. From the employers' point of view, the most unfortunate thing about
it is, that if Agnes is as bad as all that, with some foresight and
planning Mr McDonald could have dismissed her with little financial risk
to the company.
Instead, a small fortune may now be spent in both compensation and
legal fees, not to mention management time, in defending the industrial
tribunal application.
The key to avoiding such unnecessary expense is fairness coupled with
planning. Usually dismissals occur for reasons which have either been
apparent for some time or arise because of sudden behaviour on the part
of the employee, constituting a breach of the contractual
employer/employee relationship.
In the former category are to be found such problems as persistent
absenteeism, poor timekeeping, poor or inadequate work, and continuing
ill-health.
In each of these situations it is possible, with foresight and good
planning -- coupled with fairness to the employee, to either seek to
improve matters or bring them to the point where the employee parts
company with the employer with minimum financial risk to the latter.
The thing to avoid is allowing the situation to continue until the
employer reaches boiling point, overreacts and dismisses the employee.
At that point the damage is done and can rarely be undone. It should be
remembered that there are fair dismissals and the end game for the
employer is to ensure that this is what is achieved.
Where there is a sudden need to take action regarding an employee,
perhaps resulting from some action on his or her part, the overriding
guideline for the employer must be to act fairly. That means
investigating the matter without pre-judging the issues or letting bias
dictate the outcome, giving the employee notice of what he or she is
alleged to have done, the opportunity to explain their position, offer
evidence and question any witnesses.
For their own sake and in the interest of fairness, because they may
be upset or at a disadvantage, they should have the right to be
accompanied at any disciplinary hearing by a fellow employee of their
choice or a trade union representative.
It should always be borne in mind that disciplinary hearings are not a
successor to the Spanish Inquisition. They are, in effect, the lowest
''court'' in a long chain, which can stretch all the way to the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg, via the industrial tribunal, the
employment appeal tribunal, the Court of Session and the House of Lords.
Surprisingly, a significant number of cases tread that path from
beginning to end and a few ex-employees have even been there twice!
Think of the financial consequences for the employer.
The prudent employer will lessen the risk by adopting fair procedures.
To be truly fair, these procedures should be known to all and it is a
good idea to introduce disciplinary and grievance procedures which
enable all parties to know exactly where they stand.
This is an obligation imposed by law on all employers with more than
20 employees but is well worth adopting by smaller employers as well.
Ideally, in any dispute, each party should be clear as to their
respective rights and duties, and to that end every employer should, at
the very least, have issued each member of staff with a statement of
their terms and conditions of employment.
There is a requirement in law to issue such a statement within two
months of a new employee's start date. Surprisingly, a considerable
number of employers fail to achieve this, perhaps believing that in
doing so they are, in some manner, empowering the employee and that the
absence of such a statement is to the employer's advantage. That is not
the case.
Indeed, a disgruntled employee can remedy the situation by bringing a
complaint before an industrial tribunal, who will then determine the
particulars which ought to be included in such a statement.
Furthermore, if things to wrong, the employer is at a distinct
disadvantage when seeking to defend an industrial tribunal application,
in a situation where he has neither issued a statement of terms and
conditions nor has an established disciplinary procedure to guide him
through the morass towards a fair dismissal.
Apart from solicitors, there are a number of agencies available to
assist and represent the unfairly dismissed employee, often without
charge. Other than the facilities offered by some trade associations,
there is no-one to help the employer unless he is prepared to pay for
it. Getting it right from the start is the key to minimising that cost.

Johannesburg, Tuesday
WINNIE MANDELA'S lawyers told a court today that she opposed a divorce
action brought by her estranged husband, South African President Nelson
Mandela, saying the 37-year marriage could be saved.
However in papers filed in the Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg, Mrs
Mandela said that if the divorce was granted, she wanted half of her
estranged husband's assets.
Mrs Mandela, 60, said her husband had not followed African cultural
traditions in seeking reconciliation, forgiveness, and family cohesion
and had not recognised her role in ''immortalising his global profile''.
In the event of a divorce, ''it would be just and equitable that the
court makes an order that the plaintiff transfer to the defendant one
half of the plaintiff's assets'', her lawyers said.
Mandela, 77, who is said by friends to be planning a third marriage,
claimed in a summons pinned to Mrs Mandela's door recently that their
marriage had irretrievably broken down.
Mr Mandela sought court permission to pin the summons to her front
door after she had allegedly dodged officials trying to serve the papers
on her.
The papers presented today said the president, in bringing the divorce
action, had also failed to recognise adequately her role in bringing up
their two daughters and her protection of them under apartheid.
Mandela divorced his first wife, Evelyn, in 1958 to marry Winnie. He
was arrested by the apartheid government four years later and was jailed
until February 1990.
The couple separated formally in April 1992 after Mrs Mandela was
convicted of complicity in the kidnapping and assault of black children
in Soweto. Her driver and bodyguard was later convicted of murdering one
of the children.--Reuter.

Washington
NICOLE SIMPSON'S diaries have been published and reveal a horrifying
story of a woman abused, beaten, and terrified by her husband.
Nine days before she was murdered, O J Simpson told her: ''You hang up
on me last nite, you're gonna pay for this bitch, you've got it
coming.''
The diaries could not be used in the trial of O J Simpson because they
were considered hearsay: there was nothing to prove any of the
allegations, and Nicole could not be cross-examined. Yet she had kept
the diaries, and photographs showing her black eyes and battered face,
for just the eventuality that she might be killed.
The extracts from these frightful documents are published in the
National Enquirer, a supermarket tabloid that maintains a bizarre
tradition of running a feature on alien abductions.
However, there can be no doubt of the Nicole diaries' authenticity,
which are published with her spelling and the magazine's ellipses.
She drafted a letter to her husband while they were still married, as
a record for herself.
She laments that he abused her for putting on weight when she was
pregnant and wrote: ''There was also that time before Justin and a few
months after Sydney. I felt really good about how I got back into shape
+ we went out. You beat the holy hell out of me + we lied at the x-ray
lab + said I fell off a bike . . . Remember? And since Justin's birth is
the mad New Year's Eve beat-up.''
That incident is also quoted, from the diary: ''Chasing me through the
house, into office, into backyard into Michelle housekeeper's rm. Beat
me on bed. Kept hitting me until police came.''
The extracts include a passage relating to her second pregnancy: ''He
never let up. You're a fat pig. You're disgusting (I'm two months
pregnant). You're a slob. I want you out of my f... house . . . I want
you to have an abortion with the baby . . . '' So I packed a few things
together. He locked the door again. I buzzed.
'Do I really have to go tonight? Sydney's sleeping. It's late.'
'Let me tell you how serious I am . . . I have a gun in my hand right
now -- Get the f... out of here.''
The Enquirer proposes to publish further excerpts. Nicole's sister,
who may have given, or sold, the diaries to the paper, quoted a passage
after O J was acquitted: ''Nicole said 'He's going to kill me -- and get
away with it'.''
A rival tabloid, the Star, carries photographs sold by O J Simpson,
showing his return home after his acquittal.
It also carries an interview in which he insists on his complete
innocence and his love for his children.

Sometimes reform of the law is pre-empted by public consensus.
Andrew Lothian reflects on the uncertainties of an engine of
change that runs ahead of legislation.
LAW reform has two faces. Sometimes things hitherto permitted become
crimes. At the moment this is happening in the case of the unauthorised
possession of temazepam.
Whether criminalisation will make any difference to the situation
remains to be seen: it has been so long a time coming, in the face of
the clearest indications that something would have to be done, that the
problem may now be beyond control.
On the other hand, sometimes things once illegal come to be permitted,
though this does not happen quite so often.
At the moment, much head-scratching has been caused to those
interested in rugby by a rule change to the effect that it will no
longer be illegal for players to be paid for their efforts on the field.
This curious piece of law reform may have lessons of more general
application.
As one understands it, the reason that players may now be paid is that
many of them were already being paid, and very handsomely too. Humbug
and hypocrisy have been abolished by the laws which govern payments to
players. Theory is being brought into line with fact.
The trouble is that there is no agreed agenda for such changes and
there is a potential for confusion and unforeseen consequences. What's
more, it will never be possible to judge whether the change in the rules
has been a success, since there is no consensus as to what is being
sought.
I mention this because there is always a danger that something similar
will happen when the laws of the land are changed to sanction what is
happening already and being accepted. Such is the slow speed of
legislative change that decriminalisation always lags a long way behind
public opinion: by and large things do not cease, officially, to be
crimes until a stage has been reached when so many people are breaking
the law that it has become inoperable.
In an address by the Lord Advocate, George Thomson, to the inaugural
meeting, in 1947, of the Thomas Muir Society, he drew attention to the
fact that for many years prior to 1939 it had been unusual for a jury in
Scotland to bring in a verdict of murder, which at that time would
result in a mandatory death penalty.
All sorts of reasons, most of them pretty thin loopholes indeed, were
found for making it culpable homicide. One result of this was that
people began to say that the death penalty no longer operated in
Scotland.
At this stage it might have been thought that the logical thing to do
was to abolish the death penalty altogether. However, with the onset of
the war, for some reason or other juries once again began to convict of
murder; the public conscience was not, it seemed, ready to dispense with
the death penalty.
The Lord Advocate went on to ask what lessons might be drawn from all
this. His conclusion was: ''We are able at the expense of logic to
modify our law in practice while maintaining its older rigour. If
necessity arises, we still have the older rigour to fall back on. At the
same time we are experimenting with future amendment in an empirical
way. We combine the rigid and the flexible. Most of our laws are amended
long before the amendment reaches the statute book.''
Does this happen at all at the moment? Certainly there is one area in
which I am inclined to think that it is and this is in relation to the
question of the possession of cannabis for personal use.
This differs from the murder/culpable homicide situation in that
members of the public are not involved, by way of jury service, in
making their view known. However, the anecdotal evidence is to the
effect that the police are no longer so keen as they once were, in terms
of priority, to detect the offence.
In addition, the prosecuting authorities are willing to consider that
minor reported offending may be dealt with in some cases at least by way
of a formal warning and, if the matter does come to court, sentences are
being imposed which are comparable with those thought appropriate for
careless driving (which many people think should not be a crime anyway).
If this be the case, then something interesting would appear to be
happening. Rather than going for the sort of public ad hoc
decriminalisation which has brought manifold problems in Holland -- and
rather than going for the sort of elaborate legalisation which would
involve fully worked-out details about licences to sell, restrictions on
advertising and so on which we have with cigarettes and alcohol -- we
might be said, in George Thomson's words, to be experimenting with
amendment in an empirical way. And of course if things are seen to be
going wrong, back can come the full rigour.
I noticed the other day that one disgruntled person, having been
convicted of some crime or other complained that the judge who heard his
case had not been elected by anyone. That this should be so, most of us
regard as fundamental to our civil liberties.
Not only do courts ignore what the party in power, as opposed to
Parliament, may have to say, but without an independent judiciary the
sort of experiment of which the Lord Advocate spoke with approval could
not take place. Respect for the law gives us the stability necessary for
tentative relaxation by the courts of the full rigour.

Washington
BLACK leaders said that yesterday's ''Million Man March'' had raised
the stature of its organiser Louis Farrakhan in the eyes of their
community, but it was too early to say if the event marked a new dawn
for black self-reliance.
Even former critics applauded the controversial Nation of Islam leader
for pulling off a huge rally of black men in Washington, estimated by
police at 400,000 people.
Jewish leaders, however, turned down Farrakhan's call for a meeting to
iron out frictions resulting from his anti-Semitic statements.
The number of people who attended the demonstration called by
Farrakhan to promote black unity and self-reliance was still in dispute.
The US Park Service, the Washington Metropolitan Police, and the US
Capitol Police agreed that about 400,000 people attended, but organisers
said that was far too low.
Benjamin Chavis, former head of the National Association for the
Advancement for Coloured People, and others said more than one million
people attended.
Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia refused to attend because
of Farrakhan's past anti-Semitic and race-baiting remarks, but gave him
credit for organising the rally.
Jewish leaders, however, refused to talk with Farrakhan.
Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said:
''There will be no meeting until Farrakhan renounces anti-Semitism, not
just denounces it.''--Reuter.

Washington
THE Clinton administration sought to allay fears in Congress over
sending troops to Bosnia, saying that the while mission was risky, the
force would be ''the biggest, toughest, and meanest dog in town''.
President Clinton's top security advisers told the Senate Armed
Services Committee there could be no peace in Bosnia without US ground
troops helping to enforce an accord and the heavily-armed forces would
reply decisively to any attack.
Laying out the administration's case for the largest US overseas
deployment since the 1991 Gulf War, the officials said the operation
would involve 20,000 very well-prepared American troops, cost $1.5bn,
require the call-up of as many as 3000 reservists and be limited to one
year.
''If we are attacked by anyone it will bring a large hammer down on
them immediately . . .(The US contingent) will be the biggest, toughest,
and meanest dog in town,'' said Defence Secretary William Perry.
One senator, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, said he
would oppose American involvement.
However US Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned: ''There will
not be a peace settlement in Bosnia unless Nato and the United States in
particular take the lead in its implementation.''
In Bosnia, negotiators from the Big Powers were due to meet Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic tonight to brief him on a meeting in Moscow
of the five-nation contact group preparing for peace talks on October
31.--Reuter.

Paris
A BOMB tore through an underground commuter train as it sped through
central Paris this morning, cutting down 29 rush-hour travellers in what
appeared to be the latest in a wave of attacks by Algerian Islamic
extremists.
Five of the 29 wounded were seriously hurt and included two who had a
foot or leg blown off and suffered severe burns and lung damage.
One victim's leg was amputated in the gloomy rail tunnel by emergency
workers.
Others were treated at makeshift hospitals set up on the train
platform and the nearby Orsay Museum, whose Impressionist paintings are
among Paris's biggest tourist draws.
The bomb went off at 7.05am in the second carriage of a train
travelling at 35mph in a tunnel between the Orsay Museum and
Saint-Michel stations on the RER regional express network.
The investigators found bits of metal from a camping gas canister and
bolts among the debris from the blast, which they said suggested the
canister had been placed under a seat.
Emergency workers and passengers said some riders panicked as choking
smoke swept through the train.
''There was smoke all around, there were cries,'' said one trembling
passenger. ''Then we could hear one of the wounded on the rails calling
for help.
''In the carriage, which was completely ripped open, we could see at
least four or five wounded people.''
After the blast, dazed and dishevelled passengers, blinking in the
sunlight, staggered on to the street at the Orsay station after picking
their way for two-thirds of a mile through the tunnel in near darkness.
Flying shrapnel from the bomb severed the feet of several passengers,
according to one doctor at the scene.
Investigators said the bombing bore the hallmarks of a series of seven
earlier attacks that have struck France since July 25, when a bomb went
off in an RER underground express train at the Saint-Michel station,
killing seven people.
All the earlier attacks, which have killed seven and wounded more than
140, have relied on gas canisters or, in one instance, a pressure
cooker, packed with explosives, nails, and bolts.
Premier Alain Juppe, Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, and Mayor
Jean Tiberi joined officials at the scene.
The blast came just a week before President Jacques Chirac is to meet
Algerian President General Liamine Zeroual at the headquarters of the
United Nations in New York.
Juppe today said that Chirac would go ahead with the talks, despite
criticism that it may seem that Chirac is backing Zeroual in Algeria's
November 16 presidential vote.
''France intends to continue its dialogue with Algeria. No attack,
however cowardly or blind, will silence its voice,'' he told the
National Assembly, vowing Paris would not ''capitulate to barbarism''.
The president, cutting short a trip to Tours in central France,
expressed his indignation at the latest attack and he said he was
determined ''to do everything to prevent and repress this fanatic
violence''.
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said that France would further
tighten a security crackdown known as Vigipirate which he said had
mobilised an extra 12,000 police and 2500 troops since September. He
said they had checked 1.85 million people.
''Yes, I'm going to increase the controls, yes, we will reinforce
Vigipirate by requesting more troops from the army,'' he said on
television.
The shadowy Algerian Islamic Armed Group (GIA), which has claimed
responsibility for the wave of bombings, has demanded that France end
its annual F6m (#8000m) aid to Algeria's military rulers.
The pro-GIA al-Ansar newsletter made fresh threats against Paris at
the weekend.
The newsletter, published by Algerian exiles in London and Stockholm,
showed a drawing of the Eiffel Tower being blown up and said French
cities were targets.
In a chilling coincidence, the blast came on the anniversary of a
''Paris massacre'' on October 17, 1961, in which human rights activists
say police killed about 200 Algerians demonstrating against French
colonial rule. France has never budged from an official police toll of
three dead and 54 hurt.
French opposition Socialist leader Lionel Jospin said he would not
meet Zeroual if he were president. In a newspaper interview he called
the meeting ''inopportune''.
Service on the RER line was restored eight hours after the bombing.
As Chirac visited some of the wounded in a Paris hospital after the
blast, no suspect was in custody, although witnesses told police they
saw a man of North African appearance leave the train in a great hurry
just before it left the Orsay station.
The head of the Muslim Institute at the Paris Mosque, Dalil Boubakeur,
said he and his colleagues ''once again condemn and deplore the blind
violence''.
More than 30,000 people have died in a Muslim fundamentalist
insurgency in Algeria since the government cancelled elections the
Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.--Reuter/AP.

THIS column is being written from a liberal campus in New England.
Life scarcely comes sweeter than from such a place, where the abundance
of the New World sustains a fair approximation to the culture of the Old
World, and where any slight shortcomings in this respect are amply
compensated by the generosity of the hosts.
It may be ungracious of me to detect that the broad smiles from rows
of perfect teeth are a little more forced than on previous occasions, or
that the hyperbolic compliments ring hollower. But I know from
experience that, in this neurotic nation, the sweet life is racked by
guilt.
Here the guilt expresses itself through embarrassed concealment of the
fact that this is a university for spoiled brats to sit at the feet of
godlike professors whose privileges make British aristocrats look like
dowdy country cousins.
The publicity material boasts that more than one-fifth of the student
body is made up of minority groups. What it does not say is that the
minority groups are most often Chinese, with parents wealthy enough to
pay the huge fees, from Singapore and Hong Kong -- in the latter case,
this may be a cheap price for a toehold in the United States after they
are abandoned by Britain in 1997.
The publicity material does not specify because to any casual browser
the normal implication would be that the minority groups are black.
The university imperfectly salves its conscience, however, for it
knows very well that it contains few blacks. Most are in fact foreign: a
Haitian professor of French, some West Indian literary critics and,
among the more junior ranks of the research fellows, a bevy of charming
and beautiful Brazilian girls, the colour of coffee with too much milk.
''At home we are white!'' they laughingly protest, but here they are at
once promoted honorary blacks, to be feted accordingly.
Coming from a truly multiracial society and not racked by guilt, they
are too carefree to bother. Real American blacks are very thin on the
ground, though extremely welcome if they can pay the fees. Consciousness
of the many reasons why they cannot pay is doubtless what at present
makes this university's heart bleed even more than usual.
One night I went to a seminar given by a highly distinguished
professor in which he set out to persuade his audience that African
slaves had brought with them to the New World certain moral standards
which they succeeded in maintaining and transmitting to their
descendants through the many generations of oppression they all
suffered.
When I asked what these moral standards were, he mentioned something
to do with umbilical cords, ritual libations, and certain funeral
practices. These, I protested, were customs rather than moral standards.
He looked at me pityingly. If I did not see that the dominant morality
was merely an alternative set of customs, then I had certainly not
understood anthropology as it is currently conceived and communicated in
the modern United States. Thank heaven for that, I said to an evidently
disapproving company.
The existence of these types -- the professor was, needless to say, a
white man -- is making the modern United States into a country worthy of
anthropological field study itself. Why does it produce professors
talking rubbish? When the Africans arrived they were put under a brutal
regime of servitude which robbed them of nearly everything they had
brought with them, their names, their families, their language, their
religion.
As a result, today's black Americans have, apart from their colour,
absolutely nothing to do with Africa. They possess no culture except
American culture, and this culture subordinates them. Altogether, the
history they have endured is deplorable, but it is also undeniable. Does
it dignify them to do away with their history, and substitute another
that they have not endured?
Luckily, however, we may be looking at the final follies of American
liberalism in this guise, that is to say, in the guise existing since
the 1960s.
It would be idle to dispute that the reforms of those years did do
away with a sordid apparatus of formal discrimination, and to that
extent brought about genuine improvements in the condition of blacks.
But it did less to quell the racialism of a society which has been
racialist since it began. Instead the state used the law to try to
change the people's prejudices.
Long before the trial of O J Simpson it had become obvious that this
was not working. But the trial brought the fact graphically into the
open. To be an American is primarily to partake of certain abstract
rights, one of which is to live under a system of equal justice.
If most blacks cannot believe that they do live under a system of
equal justice, and that members of their own race ought to be acquitted
of crimes in recompense for that, then Americanism has in one sense
broken down.
That would seem to lead towards the ideology of Malcolm X, represented
today in yet more extreme form by Louis Farrakhan, that blacks have to
separate themselves from a nation where they cannot gain justice. The
American dream which has worked and still works for so many millions
from other races, will never work for them.
In fact few blacks, being nevertheless imbued with American culture,
would follow the extremists so far. What can the future offer the rest,
then, except an endless cycle of deprivation and conflict?
Perhaps Farrakhan does have something important to say to them, even
if many of his particular opinions are obnoxious. He tells the blacks to
stand on their own feet. Where his following has grown, it imposes order
and discipline, banishes violence, crime, and drugs.
It scorns help from the whites, and more especially help from the
American state. In order to effect this utter change of attitude away
from the traditional black culture of dependence, it may misrepresent
the motives of liberals. But that seems to me a small price to pay if
the blacks do build their self-respect. Only with self-respect, at any
rate, can they ever hope to win respect from all the whites who refuse
it to them now, and start to bring an end to racialism.

EACH year the ritual is the same. Summertime draws to its bedraggled
end, the clocks go back, and a debate begins. Call it the struggle
between the forces of light and the powers of darkness.
Thus someone, probably in England, will this weekend advocate that
Britain should adopt Central European Time and grant itself an extra
hour of evening daylight. Someone else -- in all likelihood an irate
Scot -- will threaten civil disobedience if the idea looks like becoming
anything more than wishful thinking. If evidence were needed that
Scotland is a separate country, the war of the clocks alone would
provide it.
The argument for CET seems clear enough. Studies suggest that the
number of road accidents would fall, energy would be saved, and crime
would be cut. It is even claimed that Scotland would benefit
disproportionately from the reduction in accidents.
None of this is to be sneered at yet Scots remain opposed to any
change. Why? Psychology has something to do with it. Given the choice
between dark mornings and dark evenings, Scots would rather come home in
the gloom than go to work in the murk. Somehow a hard day in the salt
mines of gainful employment ought to begin brightly and end, knackered,
as night falls. It feels more natural, and no amount of
pseudo-scientific proof to the contrary persuades us otherwise.
Equally, the gains available, if gains they are, seem slight in a
country against which climate and geography conspire. Winter in Scotland
is generally colder, darker, and more miserable than winter elsewhere.
It is part of the price we pay for living at the latitude of Labrador.
Why make it even seem worse, not least when the ''extra'' evening hour
would probably be as dark as most winter evening hours already are in
Scotland?
To say the least of it, many people in England find this attitude a
little irritating, all but claiming that they are being persecuted
simply because the Scots are too thick to know what's good for them. Why
can't we introduce flexible working, they demand, or even an entirely
different time zone? Other countries manage -- why can't we? Horological
independence has a certain appeal, whatever the practical difficulties.
The idea of travellers being invited to adjust their watches when
crossing the Border implies a certain amount of chaotic fun.
A staggered start, as it were, to Hogmanay is a proposition with much
to be said for it. More importantly, the proof that Scotland and England
are different, even if only separated by a solitary hour, is worth
having.
But there is a serious core to the argument that makes it symbolic,
albeit inadvertently, of much that troubles this Britain of ours. One of
the claims made for CET, after all, is that it would bring us into line
with Europe. Scotland, on this account, is holding England back because
it refuses to synchronise watches with our European partners. English
patriots may despise everything else to do with the continent, but on
this they chime together. More importantly, they grow irritated when
Scots insist on the right to be different.
Very often they are the same people who complain about the Treasury
formula for Scottish Office spending, or the so-called West Lothian
Question, or Scotland's ''failure'' to harmonise her legal and
educational systems with those of England. The scale of the topic hardly
matters. Their patriotism relies on uniformity, not diversity, and even
the relatively trivial matter of clocks sets them off.
But why should British life be even superficially uniform? Is it
perhaps an effort to maintain the pretence that the kingdom is or ever
was truly united? Is it a way of keeping Scotland within the fold? If
our clocks changed would the times somehow change magically with them?
Sometimes it is plausible to think so.
British summertime isn't really ''British'' at all. Its annual ending
affects Scotland and England in very different ways precisely because
they are different places.
So let's have independence for our alarms and devolution for our
digital watches. Why not? Better that than the myth that Scotland can or
should be ''brought into line'' with its neighbour simply because our
neighbour would find that more convenient.
After all, convenience rather than conspiracy has been the mark of the
Union. Matters large and small have been arranged over and again to suit
England. No-one should blame her for that; self-interest comes naturally
to all sovereign states. But when the time comes to call a halt, it
won't be a minute too soon.

THERE isn't a set of napkin rings to be had in Apartment Villiers.
Chow chez moi tends to be a haphazard and extremely basic affair. I can
happily organise large-scale bring-a-bottle bashes, where my culinary
offerings extend to opening bags of crisps, buttering up some sarnies,
and chucking sacks of party-sized sausage rolls into the oven and hoping
for the best -- and subsequently serving up the least worst.
I can even occasionally rise to laid-back pizza feasts for select
groups when I delude myself that the addition of extra, if not always
complementary, or artistically arranged, garnish such as capers, olives,
and misshapen hunks of cheese -- one day I will buy a grater -- on a
Safeway's ready made 12in number allows me to declare that I made the
pizzas myself.
However, more formal dinner parties are beyond me. One should know
one's failings and I'm happy to confess to serious deficiencies in the
finesse department. I'm simply not up to the degree of organisation
necessary to co-ordinate four or five different courses for half a dozen
people. I've tried to pull it off and failed miserably and, for medical
reasons -- my nerves, their stomachs -- I won't be trying it again.
Recipe books give me a nervous twitch. My sense of timing is too awry;
my blood usually starts boiling by the time the water for the potatoes
finally does and the general agitation the whole escapade engenders
turns this cook totally kookie.
I once chucked the first course down the stairs at a group of guests
who had dared to turn up 10 minutes late. They were strangely forgiving
about having the food thrown in their face; I suspect they simply felt
grateful that they didn't have to eat it.
I tend to be archly contemptuous of anything I'm crap at -- chess is
bloody boring, hang gliding's for people with hang ups, exercise is so
eighties -- but I have nothing but admiration for people who can throw
good dinner parties.
Well, as long as they don't show off too much and stick edible flowers
on everything. This is because there can be few pleasures to beat the
joy of eating a meal which someone else has made and which you don't
have to pay for. And, even better, you don't have to wash the dishes up
afterwards -- unless you get all noble about it, which usually means
you're sozzled at the time. Which means that your hosts will just have
to wash them again, properly, the following morning. So why bother?
When Karin and Bernadette announced they were hosting a murder mystery
dinner party I was almost speechless at their courage. A combination of
Keith Floyd and Agatha Christie -- were they inspired or insane? The
preparations involved were immense.
Invitations to ''The Last Train from Paris'', a sort of real-life
variation on Cluedo by American games manufacturers Decipher Inc had to
be sent out, guests had to be cast, maps had to be stuck up on the
fireplace, and lots of lovely nosh had to be prepared.
We were invited by the mysterious Fiona Fae Thalle, a woman who
clearly was not long for this world. We had to assemble in ''A private
Pullman lounge'', ie the girls' flat at 7.30pm for cocktails. This was
considered an essential part of the evening. We reckoned we would need
to gulp some spirits to get us in the high spirits necessary to shed our
inhibitions and thesp it up.
In the event, this proved totally unnecessary. Our hosts had
unwittingly unleashed some demon personality. Unbeknown to them we were
already getting into character en route to the flat. ''Hey, hang on at
this here speakeasy,'' said Mal Conntint, a shady American black
marketeer, getting the taxi to stop outside Oddbins. ''I best get me
some European beer.''
''Pourquoi?'' I demanded huskily. I was Barbra Z Enhussie, ''the rich,
spoiled, beautiful daughter of a Parisian perfume manufacturer''.
''Can't get American beer ma'am -- prohibition.'' ''Vot are you talking
about you fool,'' I hissed, flicking my feather boa in his face.
''Prohibition, eet ees finis years ago.''
The others looked at me blankly. RAF group captain Wey Awfcourse
diplomatically pointed out that we were in the middle of the Second
World War. ''Eh, what?'' I asked, fishing out my invitation. ''Didn't
you check your notes?'' sniffed the mysterious British industrialist
Khoever, which was a bit of a cheek from a man described as ''always
impeccably dressed'' but who was in fact looking like a Happy Mondays
ned in his stripey T-shirt and black 501s.
By the time the first course arrived we were all so deep in character
that the din around the table was making the crystal glasses tremor. The
game instructions were soon abandoned in favour of free-for-all
accusations. ''Why are you always carrying le scissors'', I shrieked at
the sinister dressmaker Belinda Screete. ''Vy can't you account for your
actions at the time of the murder'', the incisive duke interrogated
Khoever. ''It was her. No her, no him'', said Khoever who was intent on
solving The Last Train from Paris case with Miss Marples-like alacrity
so he could catch the last train back to Edinburgh.
We got so involved in the fractious discussion that we completely
forgot about dinner, which was finally served up after 11 o'clock and
most delicious it was too. The vital clues stayed sealed in their
envelopes, we gradually drifted out of character and into personal
gossip. As a murder mystery it was a failure, if great fun; we never did
find out whodunnit. But as a dinner party it was a great success.
I didn't volunteer to do the dishes but I have a creeping suspicion I
volunteered to host the next murder mystery. Let's just hope that the
only blood spilled will be of the fictional variety. Now, can anybody
lend me some napkin rings?

JOHN Reid, principal of Bell College of Technology in Hamilton, hit
the front page last week with news that his salary this year would be
#92,000 compared to #50,000 last year.
A mole writes: ''The only surprise was that Mr Reid, or JR, had not
come to your notice earlier. In the days when Bell was part of
Strathclyde region he was affectionately referred to by staff in
regional headquarters as the Rab C Nesbitt of education.''
One of the many stories about JR refers to his time as head of
engineering at Bell College. He summoned a staff meeting for 4pm on a
Friday, a time when many staff would have been safely ensconced in the
pub, and proceeded to deliver a homily.
''It was a curiously anthropomorphic view of how he saw his
department,'' our mole continues. The lecturers, he said, were worms.
''You worm away fertilising the earth and minds of the students.''
The senior lecturers were cows, or perhaps even coos, who ''graze
around keeping the grass short and free of weeds''. JR characterised
himself personally as the ''Big Eagle'' who soared above them all
keeping an eye on the big picture.
Between JR, Rab C, and the Big Eagle, the folk at Bell College are not
short of nicknames for their leader.

Deserving a medal
OUR Man at the Mod in Golspie reports some unseemly media goings-on
with the winners of the boys and girls silver medals for singing. The
newspaper chaps were anxious to get the winners, 15-year-old Mairi
Finlayson from Stornoway and 13-year-old Magnus Graham from Portree,
together for a photograph and interview before they were spirited away
by the BBC to record lengthy spots for their television coverage.
The representatives of the printed medium managed to find Mairi but
the word was that the BBC had young Magnus already in their studio.
Resorting to tactics normally found outside the High Court after heavy
murder trials, Mairi was bundled into the back of a fast car and driven
to a safe location.
A message was passed on to the BBC that an exchange of hostages could
be arranged but only after the snappers had got their picture of both
bewildered medal-winners.
* The choir from Dornoch Academy took the easy route by not turning up
to participate in the Mod. When the adjudicator called out their name,
there they weren't. Which led to an onlooker calling out, in English:
''They've opted out.''
* Given the recent financial problems surrounding the Mod, the An

Repeat after me
BEING somewhat arithmetically challenged, we can only admire from a
distance the formula which Scottish Gas offers under the heading How We
Work Out Your Bill:
* Take away the previous meter reading from the present reading.
* Multiply this by 2.83. This gives you the number of cubic metres of
gas supplied to you. (Note: you don't have to do this if you have a
metric meter. If this is the case, the word ''metric'' will be shown in
the column headed ''100's of cubic feet''.
* Multiply this number by the calorific value shown on the front of
the bill in MJ/m3.
* Divide the result by 3.6. This will give you the number of kilowatt
hours you have used. Multiply this amount by the price per kilowatt hour
to give the gas charge in pence.
There you have it. Simple. It is the same formula they use to work out
the British Gas chairman's salary.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth announced yesterday that he will
develop a scheme to reduce the burden of rates on shops in remote rural
areas which provide a vital service.
The scheme is likely to need new legislation before it can be set up,
but the aim is to help shops selling food and other essential items. The
Government clearly is concerned that the rates burden on such small
businesses is too high.
Mr Forsyth's initiative coincided with publication of a White Paper on
rural policy in England, which Environment Secretary John Gummer said
was a ''landmark'' package of policy proposals.
There will be a revision of rural planning guidance to encourage
re-use of buildings for business rather than residential purposes, a
greater emphasis on defence of the green belt and a restraint on
out-of-town shopping developments which are thought to have caused
damage to rural areas.
In Scotland, work is being carried out on an environmental White Paper
which will be published before the end of the year and which will set
out, as a spokesman put it yesterday ''our own route to meet specific
Scottish needs.''
Mr Forsyth said yesterday: ''In many rural communities, the village
shop is the hub around which community life revolves. The Scottish Rural
White Paper, due out soon, will set out our distinctive approach to the
rural communities of Scotland, based on working in partnership for
lively and prosperous rural communities.
''This new scheme will help keep in place one of the building blocks
of rural life.''
In the Commons, Mr Gummer said the Government White Paper embodied its
determination not to allow the countryside to be turned into a museum
piece.
He said: ''It sets out how the countryside can continue its economic
success and remain a living, working place.
''It marks a new phase in environmental protection. All our
aspirations for rural areas depend on a secure and diverse economic
base. The Government's root economic policies -- more competition, less
regulation, sensible planning -- have brought huge benefits to the rural
economy as elsewhere.''
For Labour, Shadow Agriculture Minister Gavin Strang said the
Government had failed Britain's rural communities.
He told the House: ''Under the Conservatives, unemployment and crime
have increased faster in our rural areas than elsewhere. Rural
homelessness has more than doubled and low pay is more prevalent than in
our towns.''
Mr Strang, MP for Edinburgh East, said village schools had closed and
essential local services had been lost. Accusing the Government of being
out of touch with rural communities, he said Labour had fought
successfully against plans to privatise the Post Office and the Forestry
Commission, and to abolish agricultural wages boards.
''While the Government has failed our rural communities, it is the
Labour Party that is addressing the real needs of people in the
countryside,'' he said.

AYRSHIRE Labour MPs today will appeal to British Gas chairman Cedric
Brown to order the suspension of the company's drilling work on the
seabed between Scotland's west coast and Northern Ireland until the
environmental hazard of hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of buried
explosive devices can be dealt with.
After a meeting yesterday with Defence Secretary Michael Portillo,
they said they accepted that the department was not responsible for
dumping the devices.
Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) and Mr Brian
Donohoe (Cunninghame South) appealed to anyone who knew how the
''mysterious'' dumping was carried out, and when, to come forward.
Possibilities are foreign vessels or industrial dumping.
The MPs said it was astounded that the MOD was unable to identify the
devices -- made of phosphorus and petrol -- or where they had come from,
or even for what purpose they were designed, but they said they had been
impressed by Mr Portillo's concern and his desire to be helpful.
The MPs said they were convinced that the devices had been disturbed
by British Gas drilling as it sought to create a trough on the seabed
for a pipeline. They understood that no fewer that 1894 metal contacts
had been made.
They also believe that British Gas has been drilling outside the
designated Beaufort Dyke safe area. Mr Donohoe said he also was
concerned about deep fishing activity, as methods now used could
dislodge further devices.
He said he had found the Department of Trade and Industry
''complacent,'' and thought that the Scottish Office probably was the
best body to co-ordinate the Government effort to deal with what could
be a considerable environmental and health risk.

WHILE the Opposition was seeking to bring Mr Michael Howard to justice
yesterday, a terrible thought had struck Mr Tony Marlow, the robust
right-wing Tory MP for Northampton North.
Had Mr Major realised, he trumpeted, that, with this Scottish
parliament thing the Opposition parties were seeking to foist on the
constitution, it would be possible for a party without a majority in
England to rule England.
It was not for a Prime Minister to put right one of his back benchers
in the very face of the enemy, even one who has told him to resign. So
Mr Major simply agreed that the Constitutional Convention proposals
would be ''very damaging'' to the United Kingdom.
If Mr Blair had not already used up his three questions attempting to
have Mr Howard sentenced to a period on the back benches or if almost
any Scottish non-Tory MP had caught the Speaker's eye, they could have
reminded Mr Marlow that for the past 16 years a party without a majority
in Scotland has been governing Scotland.
They might have added that what is sauce for the goose should do for
the gander, although Mr Tommy Graham and a few others might have found
pithier ways of making the same point.
And although this nightmare vision of England under the heel of a
Scots-Welsh oligarchy had just assailed Mr Marlow's consciousness, it is
more than just a terrible possibility. It has actually happened a few
times before.
In February 1974, for example, with only 237 English MPs to the
Tories' 268, Labour formed a Government. England thus survived this
ordeal already, although it has had nothing like the practice of
Scotland at making the best of Governments doing things to you that you
didn't vote for.
As Tory MPs, aware that the boot is likely to be on the Scottish foot
more frequently, have not been slow to point out to us, it's the price
you have to be prepared to pay for the benefits of being in the United
Kingdom.
Mr Blair, at the moment, seems on course to collect an English
majority anyway so Mr Marlow may at least have the satisfaction of
knowing that he is not under alien rule even although a Labour Cabinet
might appear rather Doric-dominated to one from the East Midlands.
Although Mr Major is all set to defend the Union again after saving it
from the horrors of devolution in 1992, his more immediate task was to
save his Home Secretary.
Mr Howard the previous day had been at pains to emphasise that while
he was responsible for policy he was not responsible for the execution
-- or perhaps non-execution would be more accurate in the case of the
prison service -- of day-to-day security.
However, Mr Blair pointed out that the aggrieved Mr Derek Lewis, now
ex-director general of the service, had claimed that Mr Howard had
interfered in just such matters as prison visits, discipline and so on.
Therefore, though this was understood rather than stated, Mr Howard
should be dismissed to the punishment benches where non-Ministers serve
their time.
One got the impression that Mr Major was not quite sure exactly what
the charges against Mr Howard amounted to. He therefore made his loyal
defence of his colleague in firm but general terms.
It looked as though Mr Howard probably had suggested this or that
should be done, which it is very hard to think a Home Secretary should
not be able to do without being accused of taking over the running of
the service.
With the Learmont Report's complaint that prison administrators were
submerged in a sea of paperwork from the Home Office it is easier to
sympathise. His officials, having built a paper mountain higher than Ben
Nevis, Mr Howard's first reform should clearly be to demand that next
year paper must not rise higher than the 117-ft top of Cleland House,
the prison service headquarters.
Officials found to have contributed to exceeding this limit should be
sentenced to climb or at any rate run round Ben Nevis.

<HEADLINE>Row over #1m  of public money given to help troubled NHS trust</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975831300</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A POLITICAL row has broken out over the allocation of #1m of public
money to help prop up a NHS trust.
Labour's Scottish health spokesman John McAllion said the cash award,
to the beleaguered Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust, smacked of a
Government ''slush fund''.
''What they are actually doing here is rewarding failure. Money is
being used to deal with emergencies for which the Government has no
other answer,'' he said.
The trust, which is facing an operating deficit of at least #2m,
received the money from its main funding body, Grampian Health Board.
The board yesterday said the money had come from the Scottish Office
as a reimbursement of a general health board underspend throughout
Scotland.
Board chairman Mr Frank Hartnett admitted the decision to give cash to
the trust meant services which would normally have a higher priority,
such as nurses, physiotherapy and health promotions, would lose out.
He said: ''The use of money in the health service is always about a
matter of judgment.
''Sometimes there is a conflict and we feel that, at this time, the
trust needs the additional support perhaps more than other priorities in
the scheme of things.''
Mr Hartnett said the board had been told it would receive #1.5m from
the Scottish Office, #1m of which would go to help out the ailing Trust.
''We want to ensure that services to patients are not adversely
affected while the trust finalises its recovery plan for Scottish Office
approval.
A Scottish Office spokesman confirmed that the underspend money is to
be reimbursed to boards and it had indicated in advance to Grampian and
Highland Health Boards how much their share was likely to be.
He said it was recognised that these areas had NHS Trusts in financial
difficulty, although he stressed that the decision to give the money to
the trusts was made by the individual boards.
Aberdeen North MP Bob Hughes said he had written to Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth urging him to ''come clean'' over the cash allocation.
''It is just not acceptable that #1m can be suddenly found to bail out
a trust in financial difficulties when I am constantly told that needy
developments cannot be funded because there is no money.
''The whole trust system is a quagmire of a financial mess and Mr
Forsyth is going to have to come clean.
''I have asked him for full public accountability about what has
happened to the Aberdeen trust. There were suggestions even last week
that the health board was going to come to its rescue.
''It is not acceptable that there is this wall of secrecy and the
handing out of money as though they were handing out a lollipop to keep
the kid quiet. It is no way to run a health service,'' said Mr Hughes.
Mr McAllion said the main problem with the allocation was that, if
there was a surplus left over, then that should be distributed in line
with health service needs and priorities.
''What the priority seems to be in this case is propping up the market
where it has broken down and that is not satisfactory,'' he said.
''The Scottish Office is using this money to cover up what is going
on. It is Government panic measures.''

AS ONE Cabinet Minister was out of trouble last night, another one
faces a grilling in the Commons tomorrow. The Prime Minister is standing
by both of them.
Home Secretary Michael Howard is accused by Labour of misleading the
Commons last January when he said that he did not interfere in the
day-to-day decisions of running the prison service south of the Border.
However, Labour leader Tony Blair insists that he did when he tried to
influence a decision on whether the governor of Parkhurst prison on the
Isle of Wight should be sacked after dangerous criminals had escaped.
Last night, Labour decided to force a debate on prisons tomorrow
instead of using its parliamentary time scheduled for the issue of the
national lottery.
If Mr Howard can be proved to have misled the House of Commons last
January, he may have to resign. However, there is little fear of this,
because the Prime Minister and Tory back benchers are supporting him in
his decision taken on Monday to sack Mr Derek Lewis, the
director-general of the Prison Service.
This is an ongoing embarrassment for the Prime Minister, but at least
the Tory furore over the party conference speech last week of his
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo is abating.
Last night, Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind calmed a special meeting
of 30 pro-European Tory back benchers who vociferously protested about
the ''jingoistic'' Defence Secretary's speech last week in Blackpool.
Mr Rifkind told them: ''Lessons have been learned,'' indicating that
Mr Portillo will not be permitted by his Cabinet colleagues to repeat
sentiments geared to winning back the favour of the Tory right-wing.
Afterwards, the pro-Europe Tories said that they now consider that
''this unfortunate incident'' is closed. They have cancelled their plan
to demand a meeting with the Prime Minister.
However, if that affair is closed, as far as the Tories are concerned,
now Mr Howard will be obliged to give a detailed report on his conduct
on the prison service tomorrow. Both these embarrassments are ones that
the Prime Minister could have done without.
Labour's aim in tomorrow's debate is to clarify the distinction Mr
Howard repeatedly has drawn between policy and operational matters --
and in particular to investigate whether he had anything to do with the
''operational'' decision to oust Parkhurst governor John Marriott.
The Home Office issued a statement which appeared to constitute a
denial that the Home Secretary precipitated Mr Marriott's removal.
After Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Lewis spoke about the
extent to which the distinction between policy and operational matters
had broken down.
He told reporters that in such a complex service, some blurring of the
distinction was inevitable -- but it was ''far more blurred than it
needs to be''.
He suggested strongly that ministerial appetites for information were
so insatiable that he was left with too little time to manage the
service effectively.
He said: ''Just look at the figures -- a thousand documents going from
the Prison Service to the Home Office in 83 working days. These tended
to spawn discussions, meetings and so on.''
Earlier yesterday, the Chief Inspector of Prisons Judge Stephen Tumim
insisted the Home Secretary was responsible in law for prisons.
He contradicted Mr Howard's argument that he was not responsible for
operational matters. ''If you are dividing policy and operations it
means the Home Secretary is not responsible for anything at all,'' the
judge told BBC Radio.

AROUND 2000 blue-collar workers at chemical giant Zeneca's UK plants,
including 350 at Grangemouth, yesterday began an industrial action
ballot over pay which could lead to a series of selective stoppages.
Zeneca, which comprises the pharmaceutical, speciality chemicals, and
agrochemical businesses demerged from ICI three years ago, has had its
final offer of a 3.75% pay increase overwhelmingly rejected by members
of the manual unions.
Transport and General Workers' Union national secretary Fred Higgs
said yesterday it was regrettable there should be a need for such
action.
''However, it is totally unreasonable for the company to expect our
members to accept a pay offer below both the rate of inflation and the
rate of settlement across the industry.''
He said this was symptomatic of the deteriorating industrial relations
within Zeneca since its creation. The company could clearly afford more,
having recorded profits up by 37% last year, for which chairman Sir
Denys Henderson had even praised the employees' extraordinary efforts.
Those being balloted at Grangemouth work on the manufacture of
speciality chemicals and bio-science products. The result should be
known early next month.

Paris unmatched: in the great spring collections jamboree, John
Davidson finds scanty minimalists jostling with high-octane surrealists
and others who are making merry with more and more detail
PARIS fashion is a truly international affair. The city positively
basks in its continuing pre-eminence as the undisputed capital of the
fashion world. No other city can match the vast number or infinite
variety of this week's runway presentations here in Paris for
spring/summer 1996.
Legions of Japanese (led by established stars, Miyake, Yamamoto and
Comme des Garcons), Belgians (Demeulemeester, Margiela, and Van Noten),
Brits (Galliano, Westwood, Ozbek, a token Austrian Helmut Lang, and for
the very first time a Glaswegian Scot, David Purvis) -- all are showing
here in the belief that no city matches the heady cocktail of glamour
and exposure guaranteed in Paris for nine days.
The continuing threat (and reality) of terrorist activity has made bag
searches, body scans, and ID checks an added obstacle in the scrum-like
struggle to enter every hot-ticket show. But it is dynamic colour rather
than Semtex which has blasted the fashion coterie out of their
Milan-induced dwam.
The first big explosion was detonated by Comme des Garcons on Saturday
evening at the Musee National des Arts d'Afrique. Designer Rei Kawacubo
splashed bold blocks, stripes, and splodges of fairground-bright hues
across jersey dresses, floppy pants and skinny tunic tops.
Models wore mismatched patent lacing shoes and surreal fantasy wigs --
each a massive meringue-like confection of multi-coloured circus clown
hair. Surreal too was the juxtaposition of all this head-to-toe
high-octane colour with the all-black-clad uniformity of the assembled
fashion faithful.
Yohji Yamamoto's colour was more subtle. Shades of pale green and blue
were printed in delicate marble effects like end-papers from a precious
old book. But even all-black tailoring was softened-up with sheer
veilings or tiny white spots.
The show seriously over-ran the audience's attention span. Shame,
really. For, in striking contrast to the cacophony of colour at Comme,
this fine collection was positively lyrical.
Issey Miyake's presentation was shorter, if not perhaps so sweet. For
memories of the subtle beauty and fragile textures of recent collections
were swept aside by a full-scale offensive of brash colour with a
hard-edged metallic sheen. At his most creative, Miyake can push a
garment into that border territory between fashion craft and pure art.
But ingenuity lapsed into tedious gimmickry, the closing passage of
clingy beachwear decorated with inflatable plastic patches.
Belgian designer, Dries van Noten chose the big blue of an empty
swimming pool as the setting for his show. The collection was an
indifferently contoured but finely coloured fashion essay mixing shades
of tomato red, apple green and periwinkle blue with white.
Dublin-based John Rocha showed a fresh modern collection of simple
separates and dresses in springlike shades of hyacinth, crocus yellow,
pale willow green, and pure brilliant white. Fabric choices came
gloss-edged, sometimes crumpled and over-glazed, other times embroidered
with a cobweb-like tracery of tiny flowers.
Tiny was the word on everyone's lips at Ozbek. For his collection
featured clothes more mini than minuscule -- cut far too bare to be
really sexy. When a skirt is abbreviated to something little wider than
a belt, and a top plunges to the point of near-total exposure, the only
question left is ''why bother?''
Christian Lacroix's show teetered along a precipice from which it
threatened to topple off its perilous high heels at any moment into an
abyss of utter vulgarity. For in total contrast to Ozbek's barely-there
view of future fashion, Lacroix renewed his appetite for more, more,
more. More detailing, more decoration, more ostentation -- a sumptuous
breakfast of brocades, lace, floral print, and heavy jewels all served
up at 9.30 on Sunday morning.
An indigestible feast? There was most certainly nothing petit about
Lacroix's idea of dejeuner. But there remains something completely
charming about his work -- perhaps because every last detail of each
complex outfit appears so very carefully considered.
In this fashion moment when so many designers are scurrying every
which way in pursuit of the next hip thing, there is something noble,
almost heroic, about a designer prepared to persevere with such an
individual vision of taste.

A SENIOR Labour MP last night described Edinburgh Sick Children's
Hospital as insensitive for handing over the corpse of a four-month-old
baby wrapped in a shawl to the parents.
Mr John McAllion, Labour's health spokesman in Scotland, made his
attack as more details emerged of the case of Christopher Holden.
Two days ago, the grandmother of Christopher, who died after a heart
operation, said his father Mr Eddie Holden, 41, had cradled his son's in
his arms during a 60-mile journey home from Edinburgh to Arbroath in
March of this year.
While grandmother Mrs Evelyn Adam, 63, drove, Mr Holden and his wife
Helda were accompanied in the car by the couple's three other children,
including Christopher's twin Craig.
However, last night it emerged that the family had since contacted the
hospital making it clear they had not been forced to drive the baby home
and the decision had been theirs alone.
Despite that, Mr McAllion said proper arrangements should have been
made.
Mr McAllion, MP for Dundee East, said: ''If the parents want to take
the baby home, the hospital should make proper arrangements and not just
hand the baby over wrapped in a shawl. That's just unacceptable.
''I think parents in such a situation are in an emotional and
stressful state. It is just so insensitive to give them the baby dressed
in a shawl.
''I wasn't aware of this sort of policy at all. I will be writing to
Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton asking him to
clarify procedures.''
A spokesman for Edinburgh Sick Children's NHS Trust said last night
that it had to respect Mr Holden's wishes to take his child from the
hospital.
The spokesman said: ''Regarding what Mr McAllion has said, we have to
respect the parents wishes in such cases.''
Mrs Evelyn Adam said she had since spoken to her son Eddie.
Mrs Adam said: ''He told me he would not have left the hospital
without Christopher. I believe now the hospital did offer another
alternative to bring Christopher home.''

THE final chapter in the saga of alleged ritual sex abuse in Ayrshire
was written yesterday, more than five years after eight children from
three families were taken into care.
Three judges at the Court of Session decided that there was no longer
any need for formal court involvement to safeguard the children's
welfare.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and
Mayfield, was told that the last of the children to be returned home --
a 10-year-old boy -- has now resettled satisfactorily with his family.
In May this year the judges were told that, although the boy's two
younger brothers had been successfully reunited with their parents, the
10-year-old had expressed some reluctance about going home.
Lord Hope said that in these circumstances it was not appropriate for
the court to order the boy's return, and left the reunion arrangements
in the hands of a child psychiatrist. He ordered the case to be referred
back to the Court of Session yesterday.
The allegations that the children had been ritually abused led to two
major inquiries, spanning 169 days and costing several million pounds.
In August, 1990, Sheriff Neil Gow at Ayr ruled that the abuse claims
had been established but, after the Court of Session ordered a
rehearing, Sheriff Colin Miller decided that the Reporter to the
Children's Panel had failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities,
that abuse had occurred.
Sheriff Miller expressed his frustration by saying: ''I cannot with
any certainty come to a view as to the truth of this whole complex,
complicated and disturbing case.''
His finding that the removal of the children from their families was
not justified was later upheld by the Court of Session, where Lord Hope
described the case as ''a tragedy of immense proportions''.
In February this year, the Court of Session judges allowed one
15-year-old girl home immediately. On the advice of child care
specialists, they decided on a gradual return for the other children,
aged between five and 15.
The family of the 10-year-old boy was out of the country when
yesterday's announcement was made.

A RISE in oil and gas production and improved job prospects have
created a wave of optimism among North Sea operators, according to a new
survey.
More than 70% of operators responding to the Aberdeen Chamber of
Commerce survey reported an increase in business confidence compared
with the same time last year.
Nearly half the companies surveyed said their exploration work had
increased in the third quarter of this year, up from 33% last year, and
most expected the increase to continue for the next six months.
The job market also improved, with 57% of companies reporting an
increase in employment in the third quarter and more than half expecting
to take on additional staff during the next six months.
Chief executive of the chamber of commerce, Mr Derek Marnoch, said:
''The increase in employment and recruitment activity is surprising but
welcome.''
Experts believe the benefits of recent cost-cutting exercises, which
are beginning to filter through the industry, are largely responsible
for creating the positive mood.
Professor Alex Kemp, specialist in petroleum economics at Aberdeen
University, said the results of the survey were encouraging for the
local economy.
He added: ''The survey is interesting because over the last few months
there have been mixed signals -- positive signals such as the high
levels of production and field developments, but negative ones from the
gas side.''

THE Scott inquiry report into the arms-to-Iraq affair could be
published by the end of the year.
It was originally expected in spring 1994, but recently there was
speculation that its publication could be delayed well into 1996.
However last night, in a Commons written reply, President of the Board
of Trade Ian Lang said: ''I am informed that the inquiry's own present
expectation is that the final text will be completed in early December.
The report will then be printed and published as as soon as practicable
thereafter.''
A spokesman for the Scott inquiry said last night: ''The timing is
entirely down to Sir Richard Scott. If we get his text by early
December, we could have it published by the end of the year as we have
been told by the printers that it will take two to three weeks for a
print run from receipt of the text.''
The inquiry report, which has looked at the operation of export rules
and the prosecution of firms that allegedly broke the ban on sending
weapons to Iraq, is expected to run to 2000 pages.
Mr Lang said: ''I understand Sir Richard has virtually finished the
section of his report dealing with prosecutions arising from exports to
Iraq in the period 1984-90.
''He is currently completing the writing of his Recommendations
Chapter.''
Mr Lang added: ''I understand that the inquiry is engaged in seeking
comments on criticisms of individuals made by Sir Richard Scott in the
prosecutions section of the report.
''When Sir Richard has received those comments, he will consider them
and, as appropriate, revise the report.''

HIGHLAND Regional Council said yesterday it was actively monitoring
the Fort William Sleeper to ensure that sufficient carriages were
maintained on the service.
To back up this pressure, a special meeting between the council and
the Scotrail director for Scotland, Mr John Ellis, will be held on
October 25 at the Kingsmill Hotel, Inverness.
Campaigners have stated that current Scotrail plans to operate a
modified service throughout the winter are in contravention of the court
ruling which saved the sleeper.
Furthermore, they claim demand for the sleeper has doubled.
At times midweek, Scotrail will run only one sleeper carriage on the
line.If its computerised reservations booking service showed a rise in
demand then more carriages would be run.
Earlier this year, the council successfully gained an interdict
stopping British Rail from closing down the sleeper.
However, council chief executive Ronald Stevenson said: ''Whilst we
are actively pressuring for sufficient carriages to be run, the sleeper
has been preserved and therefore we do not consider it relevant to
return to the court.''
Mr Stevenson added that his authority would also continue to press for
the sleeper service to be properly marketed. Campaigners claim potential
customers have found it difficult to make sleeper bookings.
Local council member, Councillor Iain Macdonald, confirmed the October
25 meeting and emphasised that Highland region and Scotrail intended to
work in partnership to ensure a proper sleeper service.

<RECORDNO>975831320</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WOMAN broke down in the witness box yesterday, claiming that
Rosemary and Frederick West had nightly put their children to sleep in
the basement of 25 Cromwell Street knowing full well that bodies were
buried there.
Ms Kathryn Halliday, 38, was describing three-in-a-bed violent sex
sessions involving bondage when she burst into tears.
She told Winchester Crown Court at the trial of Rosemary West, now in
its third week, that she had often met the West children, who had shown
her paintings, and she had put them to bed in the basement. ''They put
little children to sleep above the bodies that were found at Cromwell
Street,'' she declared. ''I find that absolutely . . .
''They knew that they were there and they let children sleep on top of
them.''
The witness recovered her composure after being told by Mr Brian
Leveson, QC, prosecuting, to confine her remarks to what she had seen.
Ms Halliday told the jury of eight men and four women of sex sessions
with Rosemary and Frederick West during 1988 and 1989 which became more
and more violent.
They ended when she realised that matters were getting out of hand and
dangerous, Ms Halliday, a lesbian, told the court.
On one occasion, she was taken into a bedroom at 25 Cromwell Street
which contained a four-poster bed with two hooks on a pelmet. She was
shown rubberised masks that covered the head and face, some with no
holes to enable breathing. She was also shown whips.
''I was very, very vulnerable,'' she said. ''The scenario was very
much like a moth to a flame.
''You kept going back until you burned yourself . . . I kept going
back until I could take no more.''
Earlier another witness, Mr Arthur Dobbs, described how he met
Rosemary West at 25 Cromwell Street after answering an advertisement in
a contact magazine. She had given her name as Mandy.
He was taken into a small bedroom by Mrs West with her husband
following. He did not object to what was going on.
''Was Mrs West friendly?''
''Very friendly,'' the witness replied.
He paid frequent visits to 25 Cromwell Street -- roughly three times a
week. Initially, he paid #10 on each visit but there was no charge later
as he carried out repairs on Mr West's van.
Once, over a cup of tea, Mrs West made a speech during which she said
that her husband had been having sex with the children. The witness said
he thought that was odd. Something had slipped out which was not meant
to.
He was an inquisitive sort of person and kept it in his mind, thinking
one day it would be ''a little armour of mine''. Some time later, he
informed the social services about the revelation.
In the morning session, the court was told of prolonged screams in the
night at 25 Cromwell Street and female cries of ''stop it daddy'' and
''no . . . no . . . please''.
On one occasion, Rosemary West explained them away by saying her
daughter Heather was having one of her regular nightmares.
The court has heard that Heather was last seen alive in June, 1987.
Her mutilated remains were recovered last year from the garden at 25
Cromwell Street. Yesterday, would have been her 25th birthday.
Mrs West denies murdering Heather and nine other young girls and
women.
Mrs Jane Hamer told the jury how she and her boyfriend went to live at
Cromwell Street in 1976 after her 16th birthday.
She described how one evening she heard children's screams and
shouting and a cry of ''stop it daddy''. The screams were coming from
the cellar area of the house. It was a female voice.
It could only have been Heather or her sister Mae. The witness said
she heard several screams.
The witness said Rosemary West seemed to be the dominant character in
the family. She told everyone what to do and when to do it.
Another witness, Mr Erwin Marshall, described how he stayed at the
house one evening in 1980. ''I couldn't sleep, being in a strange
place,'' he said. ''I heard some noises and thought I heard a scream and
someone shout. It went on for about 10 to 20 minutes -- something like
that.''
The screaming seemed quite long, then there was a break and it began
again. He heard cries of ''No, no, please''.
He had seen Heather earlier that night. She seemed to be a shy girl.
Mrs West said she was a bit backward and didn't talk very much.
The following morning, Mrs West explained the screams by saying
Heather was having one of her regular nightmares.
In 1988, he was told by Mrs West that Heather had run away from home.
He asked if she had called the police and she said she had.
The witness said Mrs West claimed Heather had been uncontrollable.
There was nothing much she could do about Heather having run away.
At the time, Mr West was laying foundations for a patio in the garden.
Heather's remains were found under the patio, the court has been told.
The witness said he never saw Heather again.
Mrs Margaretta Dix, who lived across from 25 Cromwell Street, said
Rosemary West was the boss in her house.
Told that Heather had left home, she asked Mrs West if she had made
inquiries.
''No,'' Mrs West is alleged to have responded. ''I am not bothered if
she is dead or alive. She has made her bed and she must lie on it.''
The witness said: ''Had it been one of mine, I'd have been worried
sick. Rose didn't seem to care at all.''
Another witness, Mrs Linda Tonks, described a conversation with the
Wests during which Mr West had said that Anne Marie, who lived at 25
Cromwell Street, had a sister Charmaine whose mother, Rena, was
Scottish.
The jury has been told that Rena West's body was recovered from a
field near Gloucester. It is alleged Charmaine's remains were found at a
flat at 25 Midland Road in the town.
Mrs West is not accused of Rena West's murder.
The witness told the court that Mr West said Charmaine had been sent
to live with her mother in Scotland because Rose had her little ones and
could not cope with them all.
She said Mr West had described how Anne Marie had run away from home.
Mr West had brought her back -- he had punched her on the face and
carried her into his van quite easily.
On another occasion, in a discussion about videos, Mrs West told her
that they had videos at home and said it was ''the real McCoy''.
Tomorrow, the judge, the jury, counsel, and court officials will visit
25 Cromwell Street.
At the start of yesterday's proceedings, Mr Richard Ferguson QC, asked
that Mrs West be excused from attending the visit.
''I don't wish to go into detail at this stage,'' he said. ''Suffice
to say this was for many years the family home and it would be unduly
distressing.''
Mr Justice Mantell said: ''Her absence is excused.''
The trial continues today, when Ms Halliday will be cross-examined.

PROTESTERS opposed to the toll charges on the newly opened Skye bridge
yesterday threatened to step up their campaign of civil disobedience.
Their pledge follows charges against up to 30 people following a
blockade of the bridge on the first day of tolls yesterday.
Campaigners in around 25 cars and led by the Isle of Skye Pipe Band
blocked barriers at the bridge for several hours. Eventually police
stepped in after one barrier was raised and around 10 cars drove
through.
Highland police said a number of people had been charged with offences
relating to the Roads and Streetworks Acts 1991. Reports will now be
sent to the procurator-fiscal.
But activists said they would not be deterred by the police action.
The organisers of yesterday's protest said a plan of action would be
drawn up following public meetings of Skye and Kyle Against The Tolls
(Skat) in Kyleakin and Portree later this week.
Direct tactics to be considered include:
* Further mass non-payment demonstrations, dubbed ''freedom convoys''
by participants;
* Individual non-payment;
* Driving on to the bridge from the Skye end, where there are no
barriers, but turning back before passing through the toll barriers on
the mainland to disrupt traffic;
* And paying tolls in small denomination coinage.
Skat will also examine legal technicalities and loopholes and leaflet
the public.
Skye Councillor Andrew Millar, a leading protester, said legal advice
would be taken and the campaign could become a test case for the courts.
Well-known activist Robbie the Pict was also among yesterday's
demonstrators.
He said: ''We will be debriefed with other Skat members and discuss
what has happened so far. There will be careful deliberations to make
sure we are on the right track and not doing anything silly.
''At some time there will certainly be another freedom convoy and we
will keep the kettle boiling in other ways.
''What happened before was just a trickle -- a gesture to show we
would respond within the first hour of tolls being started. It will get
much larger.''
Bridge manager Mr Russell Thomson stressed there had never been any
fears that yesterday's action would get out of hand.
Mr Thomson said: ''It would appear that the stance of protesters was
not against the bridge and not that they had any gripe against the
developers, but a complaint against the Scottish Office and the toll
border system.
''There was no indication from the events of last night that toll
staff or administration staff are going to be the ones caught in the
middle.''
He said he would be continually reviewing the situation with his
superiors and would consider ways of improving the system for dealing
with non-payment.
Mr Thomson also quelled fears that blockades could prevent access
through barriers to emergency vehicles and other travellers. He said
extra barriers at the widened toll end would always be kept clear. He
said protesters had accepted that fact.
Mr Thomson added: ''Everything is running fine now. With daylight, has
come positive feedback from the public.''
He said traffic levels on the first day were nearing 1700, a normal
level for the former ferry at this time of year.

TORY divisions over the ban on homosexuals serving in the armed forces
surfaced in the Commons last night as the Government rebuffed an
Opposition attack on its defence policy.
Former whip Michael Brown, who has openly said he is homosexual, told
the House that ''in this day and age'' the ban was ''morally wrong'' and
warned that millions of pounds would be paid out in compensation if it
was not lifted.
Mr Brown, MP for Brigg and Cleethorpes, said: ''This ban will end and
I don't want it ended under duress by the European Court. I want it
ended because the Army is well capable of coping with change.
''There are hundreds of homosexuals serving today in the Army. Some
are hunted and discovered, some are not. If they are gay, they keep it
quiet and serve their country with distinction.''
He added: ''I find it a perversity that somebody like myself can serve
in Her Majesty's Government, but not in the Her Majesty's armed
forces.''
However, another Tory, former Coldstream Guards officer Andrew
Robathan (Blaby) said letting homosexuals into the Army ''stands
commonsense on its head in a desire to be politically correct''.
He said: ''They (soldiers) don't want to share a shower, or a lavatory
or a trench, or a bed with someone who might be interested in them.''
Winding up the two-day annual debate on the defence estimates, Defence
Procurement Minister James Arbuthnot said Ministry of Defence policy
remained against having homosexuals in the armed forces.
However, he added that the Commons committee which would look into the
forthcoming Armed Forces Bill would discuss the issue.
He said: ''Homosexuality is incompatible with achieving the aims of
the armed forces as it can undermine the good order and discipline which
are necessary for military effectiveness.''
The split came as Labour's amendment accusing Ministers of causing
instability in the armed forces by failing to carry out a strategic
defence review was rejected by 301 to 262, a Government majority of 39.
It was the first Commons vote since the Tories' overall majority in
the House was cut to seven in the recess by the defection to Labour of
former Minister Alan Howarth.
The debate was overshadowed by vitriolic attacks from the Opposition
benches on Defence Secretary Michael Portillo's Tory conference speech
last week, criticising the EU.
Renewing the assault yesterday for Labour, Derek Fatchett dubbed Mr
Portillo's comments ''crude appeals to nationalism and jingoism in order
to improve his own personal political standing in the Conservative
Party''.
* During the debate, the legendary Gurkha troops in the British Army
were branded ''mercenaries'' by Mr Robathan, amid Opposition anger.
Mr Robathan expressed his disapproval at a proposal, disclosed last
week, to use the Gurkhas to fill up the shortfall of recruits in other
British regiments.
The MP, who rejoined the Army for the Gulf campaign, said the Gurkhas
were ''excellent soldiers'' but they were not British.
He said: ''It's not a happy state of affairs to have non-British
soldiers, indeed mercenaries . . . '' at this point he was drowned out
by protests from the Labour benches.
When he resumed, he said: ''I don't think it is in any way denigrating
the Gurkhas to say that they are paid troops to fight for us, they are
excellent troops . . . however they are not as flexible as British
troops.''

FIVE year-old Graham Harvey yesterday was the first person to use the
bridge, left, over the River Leven at Glenrothes, Fife. The unique,
cable-stay structure forms part of the final phase of a road project
which cost #8m and was financed by the Scottish Office. The bridge
provides spectacular views of the surrounding parkland and countryside
from its treetop-level carriageways. The local boy enjoyed the honour of
being the first official user when he cycled across it yesterday after
the road project was formally opened by former Glenrothes Development
Corporation chairman Sir George Sharp.
The 2.75-kilometre single-carriage highway and bridge, which link the
Southfield and Leslie roundabouts, will take traffic from congested
roads in the town centre. They were designed by the town corporation's
staff and consultants from the Babtie Group. Glenrothes Development
Corporation chairman Professor Kit Blake said: ''This vital missing link
will solve existing traffic problems and prevent even worse difficulties
predicted for the future due to the continuing build-up of vehicles.

AROUND 800,000 children play truant from school each year, more than
70,000 of them in Scotland, according to Britain's largest trade union,
which accuses the Government of seeking to play down the ''shocking''
situation.
Unison maintains that on any given day more than 80,000 children, 7000
in Scotland, are not at school when they should be.
Unison is calling for a major injection of resources into the
education welfare service which it says is stretched to breaking point.
National officer John Findlay stressed that Government figures grossly
underestimate the true level of truancy and schools were condoning
truancy by reporting absences as ''authorised'' to avoid bad publicity
in league tables.

A 24-YEAR-OLD woman was refused a divorce yesterday after a sheriff
ruled her relationship with her husband was a marriage of convenience.
Ms Tahira Sattar, an honours graduate in chemistry from Glasgow
Caledonian University, claimed she had been deserted by her husband, Mr
Rana Ahmed, when he went home to Pakistan and failed to return a month
after their wedding in 1991.
She said she had lived with her husband at her parents' home at
Springhill Gardens, Shawlands, before he left the country.
In a written judgment, Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell said: ''They have not
had sexual relations together or cohabited.
The sheriff said he did not find Ms Sattar ''credible or convincing''
as a witness and he did not believe she had lived with her husband after
the wedding.
He added that she had refused to support Mr Ahmed's application for a
visa to return to the UK.
Sheriff Mitchell said he had considered making a report to the
procurator fiscal but that as the divorce application was being
dismissed he would not pursue the matter.

LABOUR last night clashed with Tories in the Commons over a claim in a
biography of Defence Secretary Michael Portillo that he once refused to
join the Army cadets.
Defence Procurement Minister James Arbuthnot responded to Opposition
taunts on the issue by insisting Mr Portillo had denied the allegation.
The row came after Labour Defence spokesman Dr John Reid quoted the
book, Michael Portillo: the future of the Right, as saying the Defence
Secetary ''may well be the first conscientious objector to be placed in
charge of the nation's defences by a Tory Government''.
To laughter from Labour benches, Dr Reid told the House: ''This is the
man who refused to join the Army cadets -- an ascetic grounds, if you
please.''
Winding up a two-day debate on defence estimates, he recalled that Mr
Portillo had told the Tory Party conference last week: ''Anyone, they
say, is entitled to change his mind -- not about the defence of Britain
you're not.''
Dr Reid said he did not challenge Mr Portillo's ''sincerely-held
beliefs on pacifism''.
''What I challenge is his right to demand that others do not change
their mind, to decry others as wimps and cowards when this man held the
very same views as them.''
With Tories challenging him on Mr Portillo's age at the time, Dr Reid
insisted: ''The age doesn't matter. He held those views long after he
left the cadets until he went to Peterhouse.
''The point is this -- people are sick and tired of a Tory Cabinet
that tells them, 'Do as I say, don't do as I do'.''
Intervening, Mr Arbuthnot demanded if Dr Reid had asked Mr Portillo if
the claim in the book was true, ''because he has has assured me that it
is not''.

TWO grandfathers who fended off armed attackers in separate post
office robbery attempts were among 23 people to receive bravery awards
yesterday.
Mr Robert Paterson, 65, of Dunoon, was confronted last December by a
man wearing a Hallowe'en mask and carrying a butcher's cleaver.
Out of ''mortal fear'' Mr Paterson picked up a cudgel and brought it
down heavily on the counter top.
It was a challenge that worked and Mr Paterson chased the attacker
from the Strone post office.
Mr Hugh Ryan, 58, of Helensburgh, managed to fend off his
shotgun-wielding attacker with a crowbar at Ladyton post office.
''I am still angry at the cheek of the man,'' Mr Ryan said.
Off-duty policeman Mr David Hamilton, 29, and his brother James, 27,
helped three Summerston sub-post office staff to capture three men, one
armed with a shotgun.
Other award recipients included sub-postmaster James Keane and
assistant Lorna Rodgers, both of Muirhouse post office, Motherwell;
Millerston sub-postmaster Robert McKillop; and Royal Mail Cashco
postmen/drivers Iain Thomson and John Fairlie.
There have been 27 post office raids in Scotland during the past year,
compared with 81 the previous year.

THE surrealism of the devolution debate could not have been more
obvious yesterday than when Mr Campbell Christie, of the STUC, and Canon
Kenyon Wright published a blueprint to give we Scots more democracy.
Their altruism cannot be faulted; the fact neither has been
democratically elected and their vehicle for constitutional change has
been a self-appointed, self-indulgent, self-important Scottish
Constitutional Convention, can.
The convention has all the democratic credentials of Saddam Hussein's
referendum committee. It is, in fact, a Labour party think-in joined by
the Liberals, those political wall-flowers who will attend any party to
which they can get an invitation.
Of course, there were others: the churches who, daily, have fewer
recruits than the Scottish Tories, and those representatives of that
bastion of democracy, the councils, many of whom were swept to power by
an avalanche of one third of electors.
From these seeds has flourished proposals for a Scottish assembly.
While we may be implored, Saddam-like, to believe 99.46% of all Scots
are in favour of this body, the truth is somewhat different. With the
Nationalists and the Tories taking no part, it can be conservatively
estimated that around half of Scots have no truck with this Committee
For The Election Of The Labour Party (Scottish Branch).
This has not stopped the Canon proclaiming we are now in possession of
a ''historic document'' which will become ''morally entrenched''.
It will lead to us being better educated, with better health
facilities, and will provide our economy with a ''psychological
stimulus''.
There has not been such a cure-all panacea since quacks in waggons
roamed the Wild West with an elixir which could not only cure baldness
but restore amputated limbs.
Like these medicines, we can all have them for a knock-down price.
There may be a provision to raise income tax by three pence in the
pound, making Scotland the most highly taxed part of the UK, but,
according to the Canon's gospel, it would not necessarily be used.
Those old enough to remember the last Labour Government who cheerfully
took up to 83p in the pound in income tax and 98p in the pound in other
income, will chortle gently.
How, other than raising taxes, will these fundamental changes to
Scotland take place?
Will they plunder the #14,000m allocated to Scotland by Westminster
each year by transferring cash from, say, education to build more roads?
Will they cut social work funding to build houses? If the services
currently being provided are not adequate then how will improved ones be
financed?
The block grant from Westminster will, apparently, be so arranged that
the ''equalisation'' principal will apply -- therefore cancelling the
need for annual negotiations.
The cash will flow north on the basis of assessed need. But what if
Westminster assesses that the need for primary education requires a
certain sum and finds that cash has been siphoned off to create a new
centre for peace studies. Might there not be a reassessment of that
particular need?
What undoubtedly would happen is that the assembly would be reluctant
to raise taxes. It would then fall back on that old war cry of
''under-funding'' by a parsimonious Westminster.
Only by giving a Scottish parliament the right to raise all its taxes
and therefore be publicly accountable to the electorate can this be
avoided. Otherwise, it is a con.
With the assembly men seen as the good guys, willing to spend other
peoples' money, and Westminster depicted as tight-fisted misers crushing
us under heel, we have the recipe for constant friction.
There can be only one beneficiary -- the separatists who will be
handed on a plate justification for breaking up the union. The assembly
will lull us into the belief we are getting a raw deal, masking the
subsidy of around #6000m a year. Alex Salmond, rejoice!
And how disingenuous to suggest that disputes about the power of the
assembly will be resolved in the House of Lords or the Privy Council.
Who in the assembly will accept limitations imposed by English lords
or an English-stacked Privy Council?

HOPES of a Scottish parliament almost died with the 1979 referendum.
Too few Scots voted in favour to satisfy Westminster and many supporters
lost heart.
In its wake, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was formed to keep
alive the case for Scottish self-government.
There was little impetus to put it back at the top of the political
agenda, however, until the 1987 General Election, when a third
Conservative win encouraged the CSA to invite a committee of prominent
Scots to draw up a report on the state of the government of Scotland.
Its report in 1988, A Claim of Right for Scotland, recommended a
convention be established to draw up a scheme for a Scottish assembly or
parliament.
In 1989, a cross-party meeting was held to consider proposals for a
convention but the Scottish National Party expressed reservations and
later withdrew. The Tory Party had already made it clear it would take
no part.
The first convention meeting in March 1989 was held at the Church of
Scotland Assembly Hall on the Mound in Edinburgh, where there was an
impressive gathering of MPs, local government representatives, trade
unions, church groups, and community organisations.
It agreed that an executive be formed, chaired by Canon Kenyon Wright,
to draw up detailed plans for a parliament.
The convention itself held seven meetings, culminating in the
publication of its detailed proposals, entitled Towards Scotland's
Parliament, on St Andrew's Day 1990.
Since then, working groups set up by the convention have worked on
sorting out the anomalies and clearing up the areas left out in the
document, which has now ended with its final report produced yesterday.
Labour has said the report would form the basis of its legislation for
a Scottish parliament if it was returned to power at the next General
Election.
With time for parliamentary approval, working out the mechanics, and
holding the elections, it is the hope of the convention that a Scottish
parliament will be up and running before the end of the decade.

THE formal death of the unpopular ''days at sea'' policy which
restricted the work of the British fishing fleet was announced in
Brussels yesterday by the Government, writes MURRAY RITCHIE.
Mr Raymond Robertson, Scottish Fisheries Minister, and his English
counterpart, Mr Tony Baldry, gave the news after a meeting with the
European Commission to discuss how to monitor fishing efforts when the
Spanish and Portuguese sail into British and Irish waters next year for
the first time as full members of the EU's common fisheries policy.
Their visit coincided with a ruling against British fishermen in the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg on the ''days at sea'' issue.
The days at sea policy divided the British fishing communities, with
some Scottish skippers -- mainly in the Highlands and Islands --
breaking with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation because of its refusal
to mount a legal challenge to Government efforts to limit the fishing
effort by keeping boats temporarily tied up.
Eventually, the Scottish breakaway group joined an effort mounted by
the English-dominated National Fishermen's Federation in the Save
Britain's Fish campaign. The campaign took the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food to the courts in England and had its claim that the
days at sea policy was illegal referred to Luxembourg.
In their ruling yesterday, the European judges said the UK was enabled
to limit the number of days at sea that certain vessels could fish.
Mr Baldry said later: ''We will need to study the judgment, which is
subject to confirmation in the UK High Court, in detail.''
He said new developments in EU policy, included limits on fishing
effort and enforcement procedures, were under discussion in the Council
of Ministers.
''Against this background, I do not intend to re-activate the days at
sea policy which was planned in 1993,'' Mr Baldry said.

Brussels
EUROPEAN Commissioners are considering amending the law favouring
women in the workplace, after judges ruled yesterday that the Germans
had gone too far in discriminating against men.
In a European Court of Justice judgment which will be welcomed by the
British Government -- a frequent critic of European law -- the judges
ruled that the Germans in Bremen had gone too far in what Europe calls
''positive action'' in favour of women.
The ruling threw the Commission into disarray. Mr Padraig Flynn,
social affairs minister and supporter of giving women an automatic
advantage where male and female job-seekers are equally qualified and
women are under-represented, announced he was ''clearly disappointed''.
''The court has now made it clear that it does not share the
Commission's view of this matter,'' Mr Flynn said. ''In the light of
today's judgment, therefore, I am actively examining the situation to
see what possibilities are open to us.''
Mr Flynn's spokeswomen said later that one of these possibilities was
an amendment to the directive which seeks to allow employers to favour
women in recruitment and promotion in areas where women are
under-represented.
Mr Flynn complained that the judges had ''damaged positive action for
women''. The Commission, which refuses to describe its ''positive
action'' as ''discrimination'' in favour of women, had argued that the
Bremen case conformed with European law.
The judges disagreed and said the Bremen case, in which a landscape
gardener was passed over for promotion in favour of an equally-qualified
woman, went beyond European law.
The German judges had ruled that their state law required public
agencies to give preference to female candidates with the same
qualifications as male applicants for posts where women were
under-represented. Under-representation was defined as women failing to
make up half of the staff in comparable pay and job levels.
The European Court said the Germans had violated the 1976 EU directive
barring discrimination on the grounds of sex ''either directly or
indirectly''. They decided: ''National rules which guarantee women
absolute and unconditional priority for appointment or promotion go
beyond promoting equal opportunities and overstep the limits of EU
law.''
Women's rights advocates condemned the ruling as a step backwards and
said they would fight to amend the EU treaty. Mrs Pauline Green,
socialist group leader in the European Parliament, accused the ECJ
judges of being ''out of touch with reality for working women in
Europe''.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union will vote
today on whether to have job quotas for women within the party.
In Britain, the Labour Party said it would have no effect on Mr Tony
Blair's policy of having only women considered for winnable
parliamentary seats.
Ms Clare Short, Shadow Minister for Women, said: ''The ruling has no
consequence for Britain. Our sex discrimination law permits positive
action by employers only to train under-represented groups. It requires
that the best candidate is recruited or promoted to any job vacancy.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
THE Constitutional Convention is the most broadly representative
organisation in Scotland today.
It includes not only 80% of our elected MPs and Euro-MPs but the great
majority of our local authorities and our ''civil society'' ranging from
the STUC through the churches to the ethnic minorities.
On Friday, the convention will debate and, I am confident, adopt the
most comprehensive, detailed, and responsible set of proposals for a
Scottish parliament in living memory.
When, on St Andrew's Day, it is presented in its complete form to the
people of Scotland, it will be a moment of historic significance for
Scotland.
To a nation weary of distant and deaf government, resentful of the
imposition of laws and changes manifestly against their will, sick of
the divisions in our society, and deeply disillusioned with the politics
and politicians, the convention's scheme will come as a breath of hope
-- a hope based not just on the details but on the fundamental moral
principle which underlies all our work and which is deep in the
corporate psyche of Scotland.
In today's language: ''It's democracy, stupid.''
Those who attack our work seem strangely incapable of understanding
that basic fact. The convention began with a Claim of Right for
Scotland, signed by all our members, which affirmed a single simple
truth -- that we recognised ''the sovereign right of the Scottish people
to determine the form of government best suited to their needs''.
Nobody who recognises that Scotland is a nation can logically dispute
the Claim of Right. Least of all politicians who seem ready to admit
that right to a province in Northern Ireland but deny it to our ancient
nation.
The parliament we propose will not be perfect but it will be both
different from, and better than, Westminster. It will doubtless make
mistakes but they will be our mistakes and it will be answerable for
them to the people of Scotland. That is the first and best reason for
change.
Will it make life better for our people? It will have real power in
economic development, health, housing, local government, education --
all areas that concern every one of us. In the key areas of the economy
such as transport, energy, and utilities, the parliament will able to
develop relevant policies.
Its powers will include planning and land use, training and
retraining, and the promotion of investment, research, and development,
and the nurture of industries such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry,
and tourism.
One of the great triumphs in the convention has been our success in
reaching agreement on an electoral system which will be fairer, which
will produce a result more proportional to the votes people cast, and
which will, from the start, encourage equality of representation of men
and women, and fair representation of minorities, and of all parts of
the nation.
The greatest myth that has been peddled about the convention's work is
the falsehood that it will result in Scotland being more highly taxed.
What is the truth? Scotland's parliament will receive as of right our
fair share of UK resources, calculated by well-tried formulae which
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is sworn to defend.
Scotland's parliament will have a limited power to vary income tax
alone, up or down, by a maximum of 3p. Westminster has unlimited power
to vary all taxes.
Our opponents deliberately confuse powers and policies. Scotland's
parliament could use its powers only if the Scottish people voted
democratically for a party that set out a specific policy either to cut
or to increase tax for specific purposes.
All change has risks but to remain unchanged in a changing world is
ultimately to die. My faith in Scotland's coming parliament springs from
my belief in justice, in democracy, and in truth.

IT was inevitable that a disparaging politician would once refer to
him as the ''Loose Canon''.
For the past six years, Canon Kenyon Wright, an Episcopalian minister,
has been the independent figurehead and patient ringmaster while the
politicians on the Constitutional Convention snarled over how a Scottish
parliament should work.
Some politicians were dismissive of a man who showed political naivety
on occasion. Most now realise his inordinate patience and ability never
to lose sight of the ultimate goal made him the ideal person for the
job.
Born in Paisley, Canon Wright was educated at Paisley Grammar and
Glasgow University, followed by theological training at Cambridge
University.
Married in 1955, he and his wife, Betty, went to India as Methodist
missionaries, where they helped build up the Christian congregation in
Durgapur, West Bengal.
He returned to Britain and Coventry Cathedral, where he became an
Anglican minister, incidentally without ceasing to be a Methodist
minister.
His present charge is rector at All Saints Episcopalian Church at
Glencarse, Perthshire, where he works two days a week, while continuing
with his convention work and with the ecumenical agency for improving
the environment, Kairos.
Describing the last six years, he said yesterday: ''I've sometimes
called it six years' hard labour. Would I do it again if I knew then
what I know now? I don't know.
''I have some very deep satisfaction with what has been achieved
though. Remember, at most meetings we were never able to take a vote as
we were wishing to achieve this conclusion by consensus, which takes a
lot more time. But although lengthy, it can be a very creative and
satisfactory process.''
As for the politicians, he said: ''I have a great respect for many of
them. There were times when people played political games. I have very
little respect for the pettiness of the arguments brought up by our
opponents.
''But in the convention itself, I had very great respect for the
politicians who were working for consensus and were willing to give way.
Some would say it was a minor miracle, for example, that Labour gave way
on proportional representation which reduces their chances of absolute
power.''

THE creation of a Scottish parliament for the Scottish people is the
obvious emphasis in the published proposals of the Scottish
Constitutional Convention.
But does the blueprint live up to the expectations of the Claim of
Right signed by so many of our leading figures eight years ago?
That Claim of Right declared the ''sovereign right of the Scottish
people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs''.
If that is the determining factor, then the Scottish Constitutional
Convention has come up with, at best, an incomplete sketch of a future
devolved assembly within the UK and, at worst, a flawed plan that
contains contradictions and unanswered questions which arecrucial to the
future of government in Scotland.
Overall, the blueprint looks remarkably similar to the other major
twentieth-century experiment with devolution in the UK, the Northern
Ireland Parliament at Stormont created by the 1920 Government of Ireland
Act and eventually prorogued in 1972.
With defined powers at the Scottish level, all residual powers will
rest at Westminster, creating, in theory, a constitutional balance which
still retains the crucial centralising force of UK-level government.
However, there will be no easy division of responsibilities, as in a
federal system such as Germany or the USA. The proposals indicate some
functions would be shared between a Scottish parliament and Westminster,
yet there is no firm proposal on how such sharing would operate.
In legal terms, there are a multitude of unanswered questions. For
example, there is the proposal for the Scottish parliament to adopt, but
not legislate for, a Charter of Rights. However, there is no mention
about the conflict between this aim and the many pieces of UK
legislation about which the Scottish parliament will be able to do
nothing.
Instances are the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Public Order Act
1986, and the various incarnations of the Prevention of Terrorism Act
which are all applicable in Scotland but could not be altered under
these proposals. Can we really develop control over Scottish Law,
courts, and police while this is the case?
There is additionally no firm proposal, other than a ''Westminster
declaration'', on how to secure a Scottish parliament for the future.
There is an assumption the support of the Scottish people will be
enough.
What of those who do not support the parliament, either because they
think it goes too far or not far enough? What if the parliament fails in
its objectives and loses support? In these cases, there may be cause
enough for a Westminster Government to tamper with the way in which the
Scottish parliament works.
In fact, the convention is initially suggesting that disputes are
settled by one of two UK-level bodies, connected to the House of Lords
and the Privy Council. If the convention is so concerned with delivering
an effective democratic body in Scotland, why no proposal for an
independent constitutional court, separate from both Scottish and UK
interests?
With the UK Parliament still having primacy and with no establishment
of an independent constitutional court, it is ingenuous to base the
future of a governmental institution on ''moral rooting'' alone.
Although the convention can claim to have achieved an ''unprecedented
consensus'', the Conservatives and the SNP have been absent. This is
quite obvious in the total lack of consideration of what might happen
with a SNP majority in a Scottish parliament.
It is assumed this parliament, and this parliament alone, is what the
Scottish people want. That is seriously to misrepresent the diversity of
Scottish opinion.
In the area of representation, there are clear commitments to the
principles of gender equality and more proportionality. These are no
more than commitments to principle. Even the electoral system, some
would argue, does not go far enough in achieving proportional
representation. As for gender equality, it is up to the political
parties and, unfortunately, not the Scottish people, to decide.
There is no doubt that the planned workings of the parliament are
progressive and important. Fixed terms of office, rotation of locations
of sitting, and sensible hours of business are all major steps forward
on the current practice.
Surprisingly, however, there is no direct mention of the future of the
Secretary of State for Scotland, the Scottish Office, and Scottish
Office Ministers. There is an implication they will still exist. There
must be clear answers here. It is sowing the seeds of conflict if there
remains the possibility of a Tory leading the Scottish Office, and a
Scottish Labour administration.
In financing the Scottish Parliament, the principle of equalisation
within the UK is to be retained. This is good news for Scots but for
other parts of the UK that do not have powerful legislatures it will
mean Scotland becomes even more ''first among equals'' than its current
status.
The convention is at pains to point out the possibility of the income
tax variation not happening at all but it will not convince many in the
business community who can only see this power being used to increase
tax rather than reduce it.
The question of a parliament for Scotland does not end with this or
that set of proposals. It is clear more detail is required if the
convention scheme is to succeed.
There are still the questions of the Union and independence to be
considered in the equation. Far for being a certain uniting factor in
Scottish political life, a Scottish parliament could be a destabilising
factor for Scottish society.
Much responsibility lies in the hands of the SNP and Conservatives if
this proposal comes to be implemented. Will they back it, at least in
terms of working within it? Or will they choose to follow wrecking
tactics?
It is clear that a division on whether to back a Scottish Parliament
exists in both the SNP and the Conservatives. It is also clear the state
of the Union is going to play a crucial role in the next General
Election.
With both of these parties commanding a total of around 40% of the
Scottish electorate in the latest System Three poll, it is certain Mr
Alex Salmond and Mr Michael Forsyth will not experience a conversion to
embrace these proposals.
Both the SNP and the Conservatives are likely to mobilise opinion
against the plans before, during, and after the next General Election.
If a Scottish parliament along the convention lines is to succeed, its
backers must make a case for Tories and SNP supporters to support it.
The battle of ideas and solutions will not stop at this particular set
of proposals. What is crucial is that questions about the future
relationship between Scotland and the rest of the UK remain unanswered.
In order to avoid a deeper crisis in Scottish politics in the near
future it is essential these questions are answered, and soon.

FOUR Scottish towns were celebrating last night after discovering that
they are likely to host the Royal National Mod every seven years.
For other centres hoping to host the multi-million pound annual
festival of Gaelic arts and culture, however, there was disappointment.
Mr Donald John MacSween, chief executive of Mod organisers An Comunn
Gaidhealach, announced a proposed seven-year cycle of venues for the
event and said that local authorities and enterprise companies would be
expected to contribute far more cash to host the Mod.
There will be four core venues where the festival will be staged every
seven years, Inverness, Oban, Fort William, and possibly Dingwall, with
Dunoon, Sutherland, Lewis, Skye, Perth, and Stirling playing host every
14 years.
There will also be scope for other towns and cities to be considered
for an occasional ''wild card'' place.
There was surprise yesterday that there was no mention of place for
the biggest concentration of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. Glasgow's
65,000 Gaels will have to hope for a wild card place to host the
competition and its growing fringe.
In Golspie, Mairi Finlayson made it five in a row yesterday when she
won the big prize of the day at the Royal National Mod. The 15-year-old
Stornoway girl has hit a five-year winning streak at the festival..
Yesterday, she picked up the An Comunn Gaidhealach Silver Medal for
solo singing to add to her collection at home.

<HEADLINE>Lottery handout fails to silence critics. #17m payout for charities in Scotland</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH charities will be given their first cash from the National
Lottery on Monday, when more than #17.5m will be distributed to about
200 organisations.
The handout will come as welcome relief to the Government, which is
coming under increasing criticism for the way lottery money is
distributed, with Labour MPs claiming that too much is going to the arts
in London.
Despite Monday's announcement, however, Scottish charities say the
money is still not sufficient compensation for what they are losing as
people shun the collecting tin and head for the lottery machine with
their spare change.
Monday's grants will range from #500 for small organisations, to at
least two projects which will be awarded more than #500,000 each. The
successful projects are also spread geographically from the North of
Scotland to the Borders to avoid claims of Central Belt dominance.
Nor will there be any charge of elitism. All the projects will in some
way help in areas of deprivation.
Mr John Rafferty, director for Scotland of the National Lottery
Charities Board, said: ''I think people in Scotland are going to be
delighted. The schemes cover a whole range of projects, including
helping the homeless, the young, and even medical research.
''Eventually, I would expect about #30m a year being distributed to
Scottish charities, so the message to those who were unsuccessful this
time is to reapply.''
The distribution of the first tranche has been achieved rapidly,
considering the Scottish board was set up only in August. A team of 52
assessors throughout Scotland, mainly former local government and
voluntary sector workers, has evaluated the 1200 applications, checking
on competence, management, and the benefits of the project.
The definition of a charity has also been loosely applied. An
organisation does not have to be a charity in the sense of being
registered as a charity with the Inland Revenue. It allows small
community groups such as lunch-clubs to be eligible.
Projects tackling poverty and youth issues are likely to benefit from
the next tranche of awards.
The Scottish board believes it has done well in distributing so much
so quickly to so many worthwhile causes. However, it does not claim to
be a complete answer to charities which say they have seen a downturn in
donations.
For every #1 spent on the lottery, 28p goes to good causes, which is
split into five, with a fifth -- 5.6p -- going to charities.
Mr Rafferty said: ''I would say to people, if they want to give to
charity, they should give to charity. If, however, they are going to buy
lottery tickets, they should do so in the certain knowledge that 5.6p
will be very well spent to the benefit of the people of Scotland.''
Ms Lucy Pratt, policy analyst with the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, said it was very pleased with the money being given out
but its monitoring of charitable donations suggested that the voluntary
sector throughout Britain would still lose #41m a year, even when the
grants were taken into account.
''What should not be forgotten,'' she said, ''is that the Treasury is
still raking in an enormous tax windfall, with its 12p from every #1
spent at a time when charities are losing money.
''If the Government really wanted to help, one example it should
consider is refunding the #350m it takes from charities in VAT
receipts.''
* Labour is to ask the Government if money from the lottery is being
used to replace public spending.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith will ask Ministers to explain
allegations that the Welsh Tourist Board withdrew an offer of funding to
the Brecon Jazz Festival after discovering that the event was receiving
lottery cash. Such a move would be in direct breach of ministerial
promises made last week.

<RECORDNO>975831337</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN elderly father who issued an emotional radio appeal this month to
locate his missing son was told yesterday that his son had been murdered
at the weekend.
Mr Kenneth Batten, 75, had not seen his son, Andrew, for nine years
when his appeal for a reunion was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 earlier this
month.
A colleague of Mr Andrew Batten heard the appeal but did not get the
chance to pass on the message to the 42-year-old postal worker before he
was killed.
Mr Batten died on Sunday, a day after he was found suffering from
severe head injuries at a Leeds taxi rank.
Police believe Mr Batten, who at 6ft and 17st was described by friends
as a ''gentle giant'', died in an unprovoked attack.
He had been out drinking after work and was still wearing his Post
Office uniform when he was found on the pavement by an ambulance crew
summoned by an anonymous caller.
Police want to interview a man with a skinhead haircut and a woman who
were seen talking to Mr Batten in the taxi queue.
Mr Batten lost touch with his father when he was sent to live with his
grandmother after his mother committed suicide.
Originally from Dundee, he was 15 at the time and could not live with
his father because he travelled abroad frequently.
Detective Superintendent Brian Steele said: ''Any murder obviously has
tragic circumstances, but this is especially so for the Batten family
who have had difficulties in the past.
''Andrew's father had a letter read out on radio trying to get in
touch with his son but, before he became aware his father was trying to
contact him, he died in this assault.''
Mr Batten's father travelled from Scotland yesterday to speak to
police about the tragedy.

A BUTLIN'S chambermaid thought she had won only enough money to buy a
washing machine before her partner told her they had scooped the
National Lottery jackpot.
Mrs Linda Hill, 47, and her partner Mr Alan Baker, 54, celebrated with
champagne as they received their cheque for #1,891,543 at London's
Waldorf Hotel yesterday.
The couple live in a council flat in Margate, Kent, where Mrs Hill
works as a chambermaid at a Butlin's holiday camp. Mrs Hill said she
would be continuing to work but Mr Baker gave up his job as a senior
manager for a chain of betting shops on Monday.
Mrs Hill said: ''Alan was doing the numbers on Saturday night and he
said he thought we'd won the jackpot.
''I just said don't be silly. It looked as if we'd got five and we
were hoping to be able to get a washing machine. I am only young and I
plan to continue working. I am me and that is it so I will keep going.''
The couple have already started compiling a shopping list which
includes a bungalow, a car, and a holiday which Mr Baker said ''is just
for starters''.
Mrs Hill picked the winning line using family birthdays and her own
age.
Their celebrations will continue for some time. Between them, the
couple, who have both been married before and are now divorced, have
five children and five grandchildren.

POLICE have issued a warning to parents after a three-year-old girl
was injured when an industrial nail-gun cartridge exploded in her face.
Joanne Dowd, of Delta Drive, Musselburgh, East Lothian, underwent
plastic surgery on the wounds to her mouth at Edinburgh's Sick
Children's Hospital on Sunday.
It is believed another child with whom Joanne was playing had struck a
nail-gun cartridge with a rock or stone.
The cartridge is believed to be one of several hundred Hilti
cartridges stolen in a break-in at a building site in nearby MacBeth
Moir Road on the weekend.
Police said yesterday that, although a large number of the missing
cartridges had been recovered, several could still be lying around in
the Delta Drive area.
A spokesman stressed: ''These cartridges are highly dangerous and are
not toys or fireworks. Anyone finding them should hand them in at their
nearest police station.''
The red, plastic cartridges, which look like small bullets, come in
strips of 10.
''The nails inside are under a centimetre long, but the force of one
shooting out when detonated is strong enough to take a finger off,'' the
police spokesman said.
He added: ''A nine-year-old boy has been charged with the break-in and
a report will be submitted to the Children's Reporter.''
The injured toddler had several stitches inserted in her wound but was
not detained in hospital.
''The doctors are hopeful she won't be left with much of a scar,'' her
mother, Ms Veronica Goorvan, said as she comforted Joanne yesterday.
''She ran screaming into the house with blood pouring from her mouth.
It could easily have been one of her eyes that got it or she could even
have been killed.
''I hope something is done to keep these things more secure.''

CHAMPIONSHIP and cup medals belonging to some of Scotland's
footballing legends will be auctioned at the annual Christie's sale of
soccer memorabilia in Glasgow on November 8.
Former Celtic star Jimmy Johnstone is selling the Scottish cup medal
he won in season 1971-72 when Celtic beat Hibs 6-1 in the final. It is
expected to fetch between #800 and #1200.
Other lots will include a championship and league cup medal won by
former Rangers player Graham Roberts.
He will sell his Scottish Premier division championship medal which he
won with Rangers in season 1986-87, valued at between #700 and #900.
Also on offer is his Scottish league cup winners medal won when he
captained Rangers to victory over Aberdeen in 1987-88. It is valued at
between #400 and #600.
Highest auction price is expected to be paid for Roberts' UEFA cup
medal which he won in 1984 with Tottenham Hotspur and which is expected
to go for between #1500 and #2000.
A league championship medal won by Jimmy Paterson in the 1919-20
season and a Scottish cup winners medal awarded to John Gray when the
cup was won for the first time, by Rangers in season 1893-94, are also
among the lots.
Five medals won by Hearts favourite Ian Crawford when he played in the
famous Tynecastle side of the 1950s are together valued at #2500.
They include his Scottish cup winner's medal from 1955-56 when Hearts
defeat Celtic 3-1 before 133,399 spectators with Crawford scoring two
goals. It is expected to go for between #700 and #900.
The auction is expected to raise #100,000.

<HEADLINE>New evidence in Guinness appeal</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975831341</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
INFORMATION which the Serious Fraud Office failed to disclose went to
the heart of Guinness defendant Anthony Parnes' belief that his
behaviour constituted acceptable practice in the City, the Court of
Appeal heard yesterday.
Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, for stockbroker Parnes, told Lord Chief
Justice Lord Taylor that material relating to licensed dealer TWH
Management was relevant to Mr Parnes' claim that share indemnities were
an accepted part of the takeover process at the time.
''If this material had been made available to the defence, not only
would it have been a relevant part of the defence but it would have
affected the way in which the trial judge summed up the case,'' and
would also have perhaps have affected Mr Parnes's decision whether to
give evidence,'' he said.
He was speaking on the second day of the renewed appeal by Parnes,
former Guinness chairman Ernest Saunders, property tycoon Gerald Ronson,
and management consultant Jack Lyons against their convictions in 1990
on charges relating to an alleged illegal share support operation in
Guinness's #2.8bn takeover of its rival Distillers.
The findings of a Licensed Dealers Tribunal -- operated under the
auspices of the DTI -- that there was nothing intrinsically improper in
similar indemnity share operations carried out by TWH, did not come to
light until the end of 1991 during the second Guinness trial.
Mr Purnell said: ''The central issue as far as Mr Parnes was concerned
was whether it was his belief that indemnities were an acceptable
practice. It was an important part of his defence that he honestly dealt
with his part in the matter with DTI inspectors.''
The hearing continues.

A SERIOUSLY ill Bosnian girl is due to arrive in Glasgow tomorrow for
urgent hospital treatment after being evacuated from Sarajevo.
Jadranka Zelinovic, 15, will be admitted to the Royal Hospital for
Sick Children at Yorkhill, where she will be treated for severe
intestinal infection and bleeding.
Her condition, chronic colitis, requires specialist medicine and
hospital resources not readily available in Bosnia.
Jadranka, accompanied by her mother Slavica and brother Maiden, will
be assessed by specialists who will decide whether she requires surgery.
She is the third evacuee to be treated at the Glasgow hospital since the
start of the conflict.
A hospital spokesman said: ''Normally her condition could have been
treated in Bosnia, but the war has caused a shortage of appropriate
drugs and medical supplies.
''A decision as to how long she will stay will be taken when she
arrives.''
Evacuated on the same flight, due to arrive at RAF Brize Norton in
Oxfordshire today, is a Bosnian boy who was severely injured by a
grenade in August.
Eldin Esovic, 13, lost both eyes and hands when the bomb exploded as
he bent down to pick it up. Eldin, whose mother was killed during the
conflict two years ago, will be transferred to the Radcliffe Infirmary,
Oxford, accompanied by his father Esad.
A further 18 sick Bosnian children are expected in Britain over the
next few months.

<HEADLINE>Maxwell's pension decisions 'seen as normal'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975831343</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ROBERT Maxwell was ''an investment manager of one'', buying and
selling shares and moving assets between his public and private
companies and pension funds without reference to anyone else, the Old
Bailey heard yesterday.
But fellow directors, trustees and auditors did not object to this
because he was so successful in pulling off profitable deals which were
of financial benefit to the funds and other companies, it was claimed.
One pension fund trustee indicated to an auditor that trustees were
aware the publisher was using fund assets for his own businesses, but
added: ''If a horse is winning, you don't break its leg.''
The tycoon's youngest son Kevin, in his second day in the witness box,
said that his father's practice of taking decisions on his own was
''seen as normal''.
Kevin Maxwell told the jury his father took particular interest in the
pension fund meetings, preparing with care and making sure he was fully
briefed.
''He was genuinely aware of the importance of pension funds to
workers.''
He said his father also understood the importance of pension funds
''in terms of industrial relations, and how an increase in benefits was
extremely positive in terms of the people working in the business''.
Questioned by his counsel, Mr Alun Jones, QC, on what role he played
in BIM (Bishopsgate Investment Management, which administered the
pension funds), Kevin, who was a director, said it was very subordinate.
''I would say in the vast majority of cases the investment decisions
were taken by my father alone,'' he said.
Kevin revealed in court that former Tory Cabinet minister Peter Walker
-- now Lord Walker -- was earmarked to take over from his father as
chairman of MCC (Maxwell Communications Corporation).
But at the last minute Robert Maxwell had a change of heart and sacked
Lord Walker.
Kevin Maxwell said: ''My father called me to his office and said he
quite simply had changed his mind and was not going to continue with the
appointment of Peter Walker.
''He said he was damned if he handed over the stewardship of the
company to an outsider who had not contributed to its growth and had no
publishing background.''
Kevin described other non-executive directors of MCC, Peter Laister,
formerly of Thorn-EMI, and Lord Rippon, former Cabinet minister Sir
Geoffrey Rippon, as simply ''rubber-stamping'' his father's decisions at
the few board meetings they attended.
Neither ever disagreed with one of Robert Maxwell's decisions or voted
against him at any MCC meeting.
Kevin Maxwell later told the court that he had no idea how many
companies he personally was a director of, but he was certain it ran
into hundreds.
The trial continues.

FAMILY doctors yesterday refuted claims that patients had been struck
off their lists without explanation by issuing the results of a survey
which showed that in many cases patients had behaved violently or had
moved.
Organisations representing patients later criticised the survey,
saying it had not consulted patients and gave only the doctors' views.
A survey by Lothian local medical committee, published in Edinburgh,
showed 175 patients in 115 incidents were removed between April and June
this year. Lothian had 531 GPs caring for 803,908 patients in the same
period.
In any three-month period, there were about 408,750 consultations, and
69% of surveyed GPs warned patients before removal.
The 89 family doctors involved in removing patients said there had
been difficulties caused by anti-social behaviour through drug misuse,
prescription fraud, unreasonable demands for prescription medicines, and
unreasonable requests to be seen.
Dr Brian Keighley, chairman of the BMA Scottish GP committee, said
removal was often a traumatic thing for the doctor and a last resort.
Nevertheless, if irretrievable breakdown had been reached in the
relationship, it could be in the patient's interests to find a new
doctor, he said.
The BMA recommended that doctors explain the reasons for removal in a
letter to the patient as it was a matter of courtesy and would remove
doubt.
Among the 115 incidents, 26 patients were removed for being violent
and 32 because they had left the area.
Good Practice, an Edinburgh-based health pressure group, later
condemned the report as biased.
Ms Moi Ali, campaign manager, said it was misleading to claim only
trouble-makers were removed.
''Increasingly, doctors are striking off patients as a first resort,
not a last one. We would like to see a situation where patients choose
their doctors, not doctors their patients,'' Ms Ali said.
Good Practice was campaigning to change the law so that doctors could
remove patients only in clearly defined circumstances. Patients should
always be given a reason and an independent appeal system should be
introduced, Ms Ali said.
Lothian Health Council welcomed the survey as a first step towards
greater openness but said it gave only half the picture because it
concentrated on doctors' perceptions.

'Better to die in the ring and not be found with a needle in his arm'.
THE distraught father of boxer James Murray, who died after being
knocked out in the twelfth round of last Friday's British bantamweight
title fight in Glasgow, has rejected calls for a ban on boxing. He added
that Drew Docherty would be welcome in the Murray family home anytime.
Speaking for the first time since his 25-year-old son's death, Mr Ken
Murray said his family was devastated but did not regret that Jim Murray
had been a boxer. He said it was better that his son had died in the
ring and was not found with a needle in his arm up a close.
Mr Murray died of a brain injury following the title fight in the
city's Hospitality Inn against Dunbartonshire's Drew Docherty. Police
are still investigating fighting which broke out among spectators as the
boxer lay stricken on the canvass.
Flanked by his sons Roddy, 22, and David, 26, at an impromptu press
conference near the family home in Newmains, Lanarkshire, Mr Murray said
anyone who called for a ban on the sport did not know boxing. He also
rejected calls for a drinking ban at fights.
''Jim Murray knew about the dangers. He was a shrewd wee man, he knew
about everything, how to live your life to the full. He knew when to
drink, when to train. He was 18 before he started. He trained to keep
himself off the streets, to give him something to do.''
The dead fighter's brother Roddy described how the atmosphere in the
house before the fight had been ''high''. He said the family had no real
recollection of crowd fighting which broke out after his brother fell in
the ring.
Mr Murray also said he had sent a personal message to Drew Docherty
through his manager, Tommy Gilmour.
''I told him to tell Drew Docherty that the Murray family will never
blame anyone for Jim's death. Drew Docherty is welcome in my house. I
feel sorry for Drew Docherty and Jim Murray would have felt sorry for
him.''
Mr Murry's funeral will be held at Coltness Memorial Church on
Thursday.
Drew Docherty's grandmother last night offered a big ''thank you'' to
the parents of James Murray. Mrs Rita Wilson said that Ken and Margaret
Murray's refusal to blame Drew for their son's death came as a hugh
relief.
She said the Murrays' offer to have Drew in their home anytime was a
wonderful gesture after days of anguish.
Mrs Wilson said: ''That's a really nice thing to say. It will mean
such a lot to Drew. He is certainly down just now, but this should help
get him back to his normal way of life.''
Mrs Wilson told how James Murray's death had rekindled a family
tragedy of their own.
Speaking at her home at Rannoch Court in Condorrat, she said Drew had
a little sister, Janet, who died when she was five years old after being
hit by a car. Drew's parents, Archie and Maureen, had spent a 10-day
vigil at their daughter's bedside before she died.
''That was about 15 years ago and she was about eight or nine years
younger than Drew. They are reliving the death of this child through
James Murray because they understand what the parents of James are going
through,'' said Mrs Wilson.
Asked if she thought her grandson should give up boxing, Mrs Wilson
said: ''The decision is up to him. I have got nothing to do with that.
But I would tell him to pack it in -- I don't want him to get it.''
Bill Magee writes: Senior Strathclyde police officers who flew south
to collect key video footage of Friday's boxing match returned to
Glasgow late last night with a bonus in the form of several witness
accounts from people who live in the London area but who attended the
tragic event.
Meanwhile, Chief Inspector Lennie Harper, who is leading the inquiry,
reported his team were receiving calls from the public ''with each hour
that passes''.
There was no rigid timescale to the investigation into an incident
which had touched a nerve, he said.
''People are stirred by this incident especially when it involved
morons throwing bottles whilst a boxer lay dying in the ring.''
Chief Inspector Harper said that several people who lived in England
but attended the boxing match had come forward to help. ''My officers
were therefore able to interview them whilst picking up the video
footage from Sky TV.''
The footage would be compared with press pictures together with
amateur photographs as several boxing fans who carried cameras on the
night of the fight had also come forward.
''We are delighted by the response and are greatly assured that we
shall collate sufficient evidence leading to charges,'' he added.
Point of contact is Police 'A' Division Stewart Street divisional
headquarters special incident room, Tel: 0141 332 1113.

<HEADLINE>Six years' jail for 'stinging' Sting. 'Crummy' financial adviser guilty on eight theft counts</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>975831346</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SHOWBIZ accountant Keith Moore was jailed for six years yesterday for
stealing #6m from trusting rock superstar Sting.
The 51-year-old financial adviser, whose clients also included Queen
and Scottish pop group Big Country, lost most of it in a series of
high-risk ventures around the world and used the rest to twice stave off
bankruptcy.
Disgraced and now penniless, Moore's only reaction to eight unanimous
guilty verdicts from the jury was an occasional shake of the head.
He stood ramrod straight in the dock at Southwark Crown Court as Judge
Gerald Butler QC told the man who was described even by his own
barrister as a ''crummy accountant'' that he had deceived those who had
faith in him.
''You have been convicted of a series of offences of theft, carried
out in gross breach of trust, of large sums of money which you used to
pay your debts and finance a number of highly speculative ventures of
your own and which came to grief,'' he said.
''I bear in mind your previous good character and that you are now a
ruined man who will never again practise as an accountant.''
The judge, referring to Sting by his real name of Gordon Matthew
Sumner, added: ''It is also right that I should mention that Mr Sumner
has recovered much the greater part of his losses but that is no thanks
to you.''
A custodial sentence was ''of course inevitable'' and the appropriate
punishment was one of concurrent terms of six years' jail on each count.
Moore then picked up a bag containing personal belongings and was led
from the dock by two security officials.
As he went, he mouthed the word ''goodbye'' and blew a kiss to his
distraught girlfriend, Miss Santosh Banger, who stood with lips
trembling in the public gallery at the back of the court.
As he disappeared from her view, what little composure she had finally
crumbled and she collapsed sobbing uncontrollably into the arms of
friends.
The eight sample charges they convicted him of covered withdrawals of
huge sums of money from Sting's personal and business accounts at Coutts
and Company -- the Queen's personal bankers -- and Lloyds between
August, 1988, and July, 1992.
Sting, 44, who on Monday paid a surprise visit to the court with his
pregnant wife Trudie to hear the judge's summing up, was not in court
yesterday.
In a statement issued through his solicitors, Burley &amp; Company, after
the guilty verdict, he said: ''I am pleased it is all over.''
Then, referring to the fact that his bankers, Coutts &amp; Company, had
wrongly allowed #4.8m of his cash to be transferred by Moore, he went
on: ''In the light of statements made during the trial, I wish to say
that Coutts &amp; Company have been my bankers for 15 years and remain my
bankers.
''I am confident in their ability to conduct my banking affairs well.
I have no intention of changing any of my bankers.''
Moore will probably be footnoted in legal legend as the man who was
able to steal #6m because its rock superstar owner was too wealthy to
notice.
He had represented a number of big names in the music industry but
Sting did not know that groups such as Queen and Big Country had lodged
complaints against Moore with the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
In November, 1979, he was struck off after being found guilty by the
institute's disciplinary committee of professional misconduct.
Restored to the register, he was censured three years later for
incompetence and fined #200 with #350 costs over a second accusation of
misconduct in relation to a bounced cheque.
In 1986, Moore was again struck off, this time for incompetence
bringing discredit on the profession. The sentence was substituted for a
reprimand and a fine on appeal.
Moore had refused to hand over Big Country's records and accounts
after the band had challenged his fees, despite a High Court order.
Mr Ian Grant, the group's manager, said: ''It became a complete
nightmare. He tried to take a lot of the financial control out of my
jurisdiction and set up a complicated tax structure with a web of
companies, all of which generated huge fees for himself.
''It got to the point where he wanted to deal with the band and
exclude me. He charged thousands of pounds but we found he was up to
things like billing the band for flights to New York.''
Moore's lottery-sized dishonesty was recounted to the court amid tales
of state-benefits-to-riches, Alice-in-Wonderland investments, and tax
bills so frighteningly large they do not even figure in nightmares.
The hockey-mad financial adviser had spent years secretly siphoning
off vast sums from some of Sting's 100-plus bank accounts. Most of it
was then squandered in a series of risky ventures around the globe.
More than #200,000 went on a plush home in Earl's Court, London,
initially earmarked for Moore's girlfriend. A further #1.3m was
swallowed up in twice saving the accountant from bankruptcy. Sting never
suspected a thing.
Millions more would have probably disappeared but for the timely
arrival of an anonymous tip-off.
The unsigned letter -- which a ''deeply shocked'' and white-faced
Sting read with trembling hands at his luxury home in Malibu, California
-- catalogued the huge thefts from his accounts.
At first, he tried to convince himself it was all a hoax. However, the
revelations, penned, it was later learned, by one of Moore's office
workers and somebody who worked for an insurance company, turned out to
be all too real.
They resulted in a series of confrontations, with Sting, his managers,
and lawyer on one side and Moore on the other. The accountant admitted
everything, making clear he was deeply ashamed.
At some stage during his detailed apologies, he appeared to hint he
had been blackmailed. No details were given and when asked to sign a
confession he refused.
The six-man, six-woman jury heard Moore's blatant breach of trust
succeeded partly because the former Police musician had no option but to
rely heavily on professional advisers to manage an international
business empire of ''mushrooming complexity''.
He said he had no choice but to trust Moore totally.
Never happy with high finance, Sting reduced the court to fits of
laughter as he explained that his incompetence with large figures proved
the death knell of a short-lived career as a taxman.
Crown counsel Neill Stewart said the main reason Moore was able to
deceive for so long was because the actor and singer, who earns millions
every year, was simply too wealthy to notice.
So ignorant was he of how much he was worth that Sting, who went
virtually overnight from anonymous #16-a-week state benefits to fame and
fortune, at first thought he had been ruined.
Until, that is, someone kindly pointed out he still had #14m left at
the time.
Nevertheless Sting -- now thought to be Britain's 251st richest person
with a fortune estimated by Business Age at #70m -- was more than happy
when Coutts paid him back #4.8m of his stolen wealth.
The court heard the blue-blooded bankers wrongly sanctioned a total of
30 transfers from Sting's personal and business accounts, on Moore's
orders, even though he had no mandate to do so.
The jury was told the money was ''shunted'' into a Bank of Scotland
account over which Sting had no control. From there, it quickly found
its way into a company called Gramelda Investment Ltd, which belonged to
the accountant.
In evidence, Moore claimed Sting sanctioned the ''general principles''
behind the investments but never asked for details.
The star, he said, had insisted on anonymity and told him to draw on
millions the accountant had saved him in tax.
The performer said that was nonsense. He had never given his
permission for anything of the sort, preferring to plough his money
instead into his homes -- a #2m mansion in Great Dunford, Wiltshire, a
#1m townhouse in Highgate, north London, bought from Sir Yehudi Menuhin,
an apartment in New York, and the Malibu retreat, once Barbra
Streisand's.
As far as Sting believed, he had been approving funds for his own
revenue demand.
Not only was he ''not so generous'' as to bankroll his accountant's
financial difficulties, news of the man's impending bankruptcy would
have set ''alarm bells ringing very loudly''.
After all, asked the star, if Moore could not manage his own financial
affairs, how could he look after his?
According to the jury -- dishonestly.

A MORAYSHIRE chippy who dropped the dripping in favour of tropical
palm oil has been voted Scotland's Fish and Chip Shop of the Year.
Smiffy's, at Grantown-on-Spey, abandoned traditional frying methods to
produce the best fish supper north of the Border, according to judges
from the Sea Fish Industry Authority.
Next month, the shop 25 miles from the sea, will contest the British
title.
Owner Alan Smith, 26, singled out the palm-oil ingredient and
Icelandic haddock as being peculiar to Smiffy's.
While the rest of the shop's fish is caught by Scottish fishermen, the
haddock is frozen on board an Icelandic trawler within 24 hours of it
being caught.
Mr Smith said yesterday: ''Haddock is the most popular choice but with
us being so far inland we found some difficulties in getting consistent
quality from the North Sea . . . and we think our customers deserve the
best.''
The shop serves its fish dishes with Morayshire-grown Maris Piper
tatties.
Mr Smith's father, also Alan, won the Scottish title in 1991 with the
original Smiffy's in Aviemore.
Last year's Scottish winner, the West End Cafe in Rothesay, Isle of
Bute, went on to net the title of Britain's best fish and chip shop.

THE Rev John McIndoe, minister at St Columba's Church, Pont Street,
London, since 1988, was yesterday nominated as the next Moderator of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which will meet in Edinburgh
in May.
Mr McIndoe, 61, was convener of the Kirk's church and nation
committtee from 1980-84 and was vice-convener of the business committee
of the General Assembly from 1988-90.
He will be the second successive Moderator to come from the Presbytery
of England, following the Right Rev James Harkness, who was
Chaplain-General to the Forces.
He is the third minister of St Columba's, one of the Kirk's two
churches in London, to be put forward as Moderator, following the Very
Rev Dr J Fraser McLuskey in 1983 and the Very Rev Dr R F V Scott in
1956.
Mr McIndoe is also minister of St Andrew's, Newcastle, which is linked
to Pont Street. He was minister of St Nicholas Parish Church, Lanark,
from 1972-88 before going to London.
The Moderator-Designate was born in Sunderland of Scottish parents in
1934 and lived in Kilcreggan, Dunbartonshire, from 1944 when his father
took up an appointment with the Inland Revenue.
He was educated at Greenock Academy and Glasgow University, where he
obtained his Bachelor of Divinity and Master of Arts degrees. He also
studied at Hartford in the United States.
He was ordained by Paisley Presbytery in 1960 and was assistant at
Paisley Abbey from 1960-63. He was minister of Dundee Park Church from
1963-72. He was an assessor in the Kirk's selection school in education
for the ministry (1970-86) and a delegate to the World Council of
Churches Assembly in Vancouver in 1983. He is a former moderator of both
Lanark and England presbyteries.
Mr McIndoe is involved with Borderline, the Kirk's agency which helps
homeless young people in London. He married Evelyn Johnstone in 1960 and
the couple have three grown-up daughters.
He said last night he felt both honoured and challenged. ''Ministering
in London, I am aware the Kirk has quite a hinterland of people who are
part of the Scottish dispersion, plus people of other nationalities who
attach themselves to the Kirk out of choice.''
The church's task, he said, was to keep steady and provide a point of
solidity and friendliness in broken communities and broken
relationships.

A MAJOR drugs dealer who was said to have conducted a reign of terror
after arming himself with an arsenal of weapons was ordered yesterday to
hand over #55,000 profits from his illegal trade.
Ronald Cormack, a 38-year-old father of three, was jailed for 17 years
at the High Court at Aberdeen in May this year for a series of offences.
His arrest in December last year was the culmination of the biggest
drugs operation yet by Grampian police when more than 100 police
officers raided a number of different addresses in Aberdeen.
A police interview with Cormack also sparked off a corruption inquiry
into the activities of former drugs squad staff in the North-east. The
inquiry, carried out by Scottish Crime Squad officers from Strathclyde,
resulted in the suspension of four Grampian policemen, three of whom are
now facing charges.
A jury convicted Cormack, of The Square, Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire, of
being concerned in the supply of ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, and cannabis
between April 1993 and December last year.
He was also found guilty of assaulting builder Dharamjit Sahota by
placing a pistol against his head, forcing a bullet into his mouth, and
threatening to kill him.
Cormack was further convicted of the illegal possession of three
sawn-off shotguns, a pump-action shotgun, and 148 rounds of ammunition.
The jury's majority verdict came at the end of a four-week trial
during which Mr Sahota told how, following a dispute over money, Cormack
made him chew a bullet after putting a gun in his mouth.
Lord Marnoch told Cormack that he had been found guilty of ''bullying,
assaulting, and terrorising'' people with firearms.
The judge added: ''The sawn-off shotguns and in particular the
sawn-off pump action shotgun had no possible future use by anyone other
than for serious criminal activity.''
At the end of the trial, the Crown moved for an investigation into the
profits Cormack had made from his drugs activities and yesterday, at the
High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Marnoch was told that an agreement had
been reached between the Crown and the defence.
Mr Neil Murray QC, defence counsel, informed the judge it had been
accepted that the confiscation figure would be #55,000.
The significant items to be confiscated were a house and the interest
on a business lease.
The judge gave Cormack 12 months to pay.

A SHOPKEEPER helped catch two men later accused of murder by tracking
them in his car while talking to police on his mobile telephone, a court
heard yesterday.
Mr Graham Stephen, 40, said he had seen the men kicking what he
thought was a bag of rubbish before running off. When he realised it was
a person they had been kicking, he decided to follow.
He told the High Court at Stonehaven yesterday that he kept police
informed on his mobile phone -- telling a patrol car where to find the
men.
Mr Gary Foy, 23, and Mr James Gordon, 22, deny murdering offshore
worker Mr Paul McQueen, from Gourock, Renfrewshire, by repeatedly
kicking him on the head and body and stamping on his head in Exchange
Street, Aberdeen, in June this year.
Mr Foy also denies assaulting another man, Mr Lance Stevenson, by
threatening him with a broken can, and assaulting oil-rig pipefitter
Hugh Dunn, 37, by punching him on the face and striking him on the neck
with a broken can.
Mr Stephen told Advocate-depute Colin Boyd, QC, he had been driving
down Exchange Street when he had seen, ''two people who appeared to be
kicking a bag of refuse.
''As I was getting closer, I realised it was not a refuse sack but it
was the body of a person.''
Mr Stephen said all the kicks had been aimed at the head. The body was
not moving.
Mr Hugh Dunn told the court he was summoned to the scene by his friend
Mr Lance Stevenson.
He said he had been out with Mr McQueen, a fellow North Sea worker,
earlier that night but had left him in a pub. When he got to Exchange
Street, he saw two men, one tall, the other small, standing against a
wall away from the group surrounding Mr McQueen.
Mr Dunn admitted punching the taller one on the face but said he
backed off when the other man cracked open a soft-drink can.
The trial, before Lord Johnston, continues.

A HIT-AND-RUN driver who caused the death of a Polish war veteran was
jailed for two years yesterday.
Michael Jhoomun, 27, was travelling at excessive speed in Edinburgh's
Broughton Street and failed to keep a proper look-out when the car he
was driving hit 86-year-old Mr Anthony Watt-Parker.
One witness told the city's sheriff court that, after the collision
last October, Jhoomun got out of the car and looked at the victim lying
in the road before driving off. Mr Watt-Parker died a week later in the
Western General Hospital, after suffering severe head injuries.
Jhoomun, of Upper Craigour, Edinburgh, was found guilty by a jury of
causing the death of Mr Watt-Parker by dangerous driving.
Sheriff Iain Macphail, QC, imposed a six-year driving ban on Jhoomun
as well as jailing him.
The court heard that at the time of the incident Jhoomun had been
working in a pub and took a Volvo belonging to a colleague to get more
drink when supplies ran low.
As he was travelling up Broughton Street he overtook another vehicle
on the inside, before hitting Mr Watt-Parker, who lived in Drummond
Place.
Shortly afterwards Jhoomun ran into the back of a Porsche Carrera in
Calton Road.
Jhoomun claimed that, after the accident involving Mr Watt-Parker, he
panicked because he did not have documentation for the car he was
driving.
He said that the victim was crossing the road but back-tracked towards
the pavement, making a collision ''unavoidable''.
But Sheriff Macphail said witnesses had said that Jhoomun was going
too fast in the prevailing circumstances.
Jhoomun was also found guilty of taking and driving away the Volvo,
failing to stop and to report the accident, careless driving over the
collision with the Porsche and driving without a licence or insurance.

ARMED raiders last night terrorised a 93-year-old woman and her
62-year-old son in their home in Helensburgh.
Two masked men, believed to be carrying guns, forced their way into
the house and overpowered the frightened pair.
Early today detectives in Dumbarton were hunting two men who subjected
the elderly mother and son to a terrifying ordeal and fled with a
quantity of jewellery.
The victims, who have not been named, are understood to have been tied
up but the son managed to wriggle free to raise the alarm. Both mother
and son were uninjured.
The raiders are thought to have escaped in a red car.

SEVERAL English football fans and a policeman were injured during a
drunken brawl before Nottingham Forest's UEFA Cup tie in France last
night.
Trouble flared in a bar outside Auxerre's ground before the first leg
of the second round game when fans crashed through a bar window.
The injuries were not thought to be serious and there were no reports
of arrests.
Police in the city in central France used CS gas to quell the trouble,
police said.
Nottingham Forest secretary Paul White blamed a hard-core minority for
the trouble.
''There were 1000 fans here who bought tickets from Forest through
official channels,'' he said. ''But we estimate there as many who came
under their own steam.''

A POLICEMAN yesterday became the first British officer to be charged
with murder after an unarmed suspect was shot dead during a routine
patrol.
Constable Patrick Hodgson, 48, was charged with the murder of Mr David
Ewin, 38, a chauffeur. He died after the shooting in south-west London
earlier this year.
It is the first time an officer has been charged with murder following
an investigation by the Police Complaints Authority and the only case of
its kind in living memory.
Mr Hodgson, who was based at London's Old Street police station, was
bailed to appear before Bow Street Magistrates on November 28.
The decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to bring charges follows
an investigation by Scotland Yard's complaints investigation bureau, led
by Detective Superintendent Aidan Thorne and supervised by the PCA. A
report was submitted to the CPS in early July.
Mr Ewin was shot twice in the chest after he was seen acting
suspiciously in a stolen Toyota with another man outside an off-licence
in Barnes, south-west London, on February 28. Mr Hodgson was one of
three officers in an armed response unit vehicle on routine patrol which
was involved in the incident.
Mr Ewin, of Roehampton, south-west London, died at the Royal London
Hospital 16 days later. A former celebrity chauffeur, his clients had
included pop stars including Annie Lennox and Michael Hutchence.
The PCA has records of four officers who have faced manslaughter
charges in the past decade. Three officers were cleared of the
manslaughter of illegal immigrant Joy Gardner in Hornsey, north London,
earlier this year.
A West Midlands police officer was found not guilty of manslaughter in
1985 after five-year-old John Shorthouse was accidentally killed while
hiding under bedclothes as police searched for his father.
As is usual for an officer facing charges, the Police Federation will
provide Mr Hodgson with legal assistance.

<HEADLINE>Result 'widely welcomed' says Forsyth. Rosyth bid brings hope of 5000 jobs</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish-based consortium, Rosyth 2000, has won the auction to buy
Rosyth Naval Base in Fife with the possibility of up to 5000 jobs coming
to an area hit by an unemployment rate of almost 20%, it was announced
yesterday.
The consortium, comprising Babcock International, ScottishPower, Forth
Ports Authority, and the Bank of Scotland, was always the front-runner.
Yesterday, however, Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch denied
that for political reasons a revised bid by the consortium had been
accepted, despite a higher bid from elsewhere.
He declined to say how much money was involved in the deal -- thought
to be in the region of #20m -- adding that this was a matter between the
consortium and the Ministry of Defence.
Later, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said: ''The announcement
that Rosyth 2000 Ltd has won preferred bidder status for the sale of
Rosyth Naval Base will be widely welcomed both in Fife and in Scotland
as a whole.
''While decisions on the disposal of the base are matters for the
Ministry of Defence, I was consulted about the Ministry's proposed
decision to select Rosyth 2000 Ltd as the preferred bidder and endorsed
that decision.
''It is clear from the discussions which the Ministry of Defence has
had with prospective bidders that Rosyth 2000 Ltd has the most specific,
detailed, and credible plans for the economic regeneration of the area
of the naval base.
''It is also clear that, as a consortium of substantial and respected
Scottish companies, Rosyth 2000 Ltd has the expertise, the financial
muscle, and the local commitment to ensure that the plans for economic
regeneration are fully realised.
''Rosyth 2000 Ltd has also secured the active support and
participation of Fife Regional Council which, together with its
successor, the new Fife Council, will play its part in the economic
regeneration of Rosyth. Fife Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise also
stand ready to offer support where necessary. Where appropriate,
investment projects may be eligible for regional selective assistance
from The Scottish Office.''
The winners had faced competing offers from Clydeport, the West of
Scotland ports operator, British Ports, and a Saudi conglomerate, and Mr
Kynoch stressed the decision announced by the Ministry of Defence had
gone in favour of control by the Scottish companies, because of their
local expertise.
''With their expertise and financial muscle, this is clearly good news
for Fife and Scotland,'' Mr Kynoch said.
While the new owners faced an arduous task in developing the complex,
it had the capability of making a massive contribution to the Scottish
economy, with the possibility of thousands of jobs created, he added.
Significantly, the adjoining Rosyth Dockyard, Scotland's biggest
single industrial site, is the target of a massive development by
Babcock Defence Rosyth Ltd. Its chairman Mr Allan Smith welcomed the
announcement, stating that it was hoped a high-quality industrial
development could be achieved.
''We expect that 3000 to 5000 jobs could be created. Much requires to
be done and we are looking forward to it,'' he said.
''The selection of Rosyth 2000, with its local knowledge and
commitment to regeneration, is good for Rosyth, good for Fife, and good
for Scotland.''
He projected that #50m to #100m could be injected from various sources
to back developments over the next 10 years.
The naval base, scheduled for closure in a recent decision by the MoD,
is scheduled to be handed over at the end of March next year.
Alongside Mr Kynoch at a news conference in Rosyth was the leader of
Fife's Labour administration, Councillor John MacDougall, who also
welcomed the announcement.
''I hope it will bring about the long-term economic regeneration of
Rosyth,'' he said.
Councillor MacDougall said he welcomed the fact the Government had
opted for Rosyth 2000, which meant that the public and private sectors
would have the opportunity to work in partnership in guiding the complex
business of redeveloping the base site to create the maximum number of
job opportunities.
This, he said, was critical to the regeneration of south Fife.
Mr Hugh Thompson, chief executive of Forth Ports Authority, added that
the potential for bringing cruise liners, and setting up roll-on
roll-off ferry facilities was a matter which would be discussed when the
management team addresses the future of Rosyth.
He said: ''I do not see this as any threat to plans for redevelopment
at Leith, or through business at Grangemouth. It would be additional
business.
''We have always had cruise ships coming into the river but some
cannot enter Leith. Rosyth is an answer.''
Later, defence spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr
Menzies Campbell, MP, also welcomed the announcement.
Andtwo of Britain's biggest trade unions commendedthe Government's
decision to sell thebase to the consortium.

ERSKINE Hospital, which has cared for ex-service men and women for 80
years, is to be modernised through a phased rebuilding programme, it was
announced yesterday.
The work is expected to cost more than #14m, and the revamped hospital
will be on a green field site 400 yards from its present location by the
Clyde at Bishopton.
The project is planned for completion by the year 2000, and will be
funded largely by public appeal, although some of the hospital's own
reserves will be spent.
Chairman Lieutenant-General Sir John MacMillan said the rebuilt
hospital would better meet the health care needs of the 21st century.
Important to the project is the decision to build at least two mini
Erskine nursing homes in different parts of Scotland.
''The idea behind these homes is to take care into the community where
people live, so that they can stay where their lifelong friends and
families are.''
The Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Disabled Ex-Service Men and
Women, to give it its full title, was opened in October, 1916, to cater
for the flood of First World War casualties. Since then it has looked
after more than 60,000 patients and currently cares for about 350.
Hospital commandant Colonel Martin Gibson said the new hospital and
satellite homes would continue to care for ex-service men and women.
''The original hospital was built for that specific purpose and we
intend to pursue this policy, until the time comes when there are not
sufficient ex-service personnel needing our services.
''However, we do not expect we will face that situation for a long
time yet. Especially when one considers that, since the end of the
Second World War, there have been 60 military engagements in which
British service personnel have been involved.''

SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams was given another incentive by Northern
Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday to break the log-jam in
the peace process. An American-led independent body on the
decommissioning of weapons might find another solution, he said.
This concept was supported by Mr Anthony Lake, national security
adviser to President Clinton, after long discussions in London.
Washington welcomes the twin-track approach separating initially the
hand-over of IRA weapons from making a start to getting all the Ulster
parties to talk about a constitutional settlement.
''We continue to believe that is a good way forward,'' said Mr Lake.
The key shift came yesterday from Sir Patrick after talks with the
Irish Foreign Minister, Mr Dick Spring, in Belfast.
Sir Patrick said: ''So far as we are concerned there does have to be a
start made (in decommissioning) because only by that means can we see
the necessary confidence.
''It is theoretically possible that the independent commission might
find some other means by which the necessary confidence can be
guaranteed. If that was the case, and we can't see it at the moment, we
would want to look at it very closely.''
This puts additional pressure on Mr Gerry Adams from London, Dublin,
and Washington to reconsider his party's recent conference decision to
reject the proposed independent commission to look into an IRA hand-over
of weapons which has stalled a London-Dublin summit.
The British Government, backed by Dublin and Washington, is now
suggesting to Mr Adams that, if he agrees to a commission which would be
led by a nominee of President Clinton, a way could be found to overcome
the impasse in the peace process.
Sir Patrick said yesterday that the British Government's insistence
that the IRA make a significant gesture towards handing over its
offensive weapons, like Semtex explosives, had created the impasse.
Both London and Dublin agree that they should explore ''through the
medium of an independent, international commission of highly respected
people, some light may be thrown on this which may enable the process to
go forward. We don't see it at the moment but that is not to say it
could not happen.''
In a separate news conference in Belfast, Mr Spring said there was a
determination on the part of both governments to make progress in
building up confidence. Talks should get under way ''sooner rather than
later''.
The co-operation between London, Dublin, and Washington sends a severe
message to Sinn Fein and the IRA that, despite what was said last month
in Dublin, the British and Irish Governments cannot be divided on the
issue of an IRA hand-over of weapons.

SPECIALIST builders of timber frame houses are now firmly recognised
in this country as providers of top quality homes which meet with the
criteria demanded of homes built in the traditional way. Misgivings
about the method of construction and doubts over durability can be
discounted.
Indeed, following an exhaustive study which lasted 10 years, the
Independent Research Establishment gave timber frame homes a seal of
approval. In the UK timber frame construction complies with all
requisite building regulations and the National House Building Council
confirms that timber frame has had an almost complaint-free record in
recent times.
Timber frame construction is extremely popular. Long established as a
method of building in Scandinavia and North America, it copes with
weather conditions more severe than those in this country.
In Scotland almost 50% of new-build houses and 90% of self-build homes
are constructed employing timber frames.
But people and housebuilders have empathy with timber frame
construction for other reasons. A timber frame house can be wind and
watertight within three days allowing internal work to proceed inside
the timber frame shell regardless of weather. And after six to eight
weeks of careful planning and work scheduling the house should be
completed and ready to occupy.
Builders who specialise in this field of construction offer a full
service to the buyer from the early stages of planning through to the
final coat of paint. Throughout the country the flexibility of design
and layout of timber frame construction is evident and bungalows,
mansions, multi-storey flats and high-volume quality developer housing
are all projects that are regularly and successfully completed.
Despite the fact that timber frame houses may be completed and
occupied within two months they are by no means lightweight or weak
structures. The timber frame is a means of structural support which is
stiffened by sheathing material. The frame is capable of supporting
lateral loads and multi-storey and wide-span structures.
Moisture and vapour barriers are incorporated and the outer leaf of
the wall can be clad in any standard finish -- brick, stone, pebbledash
or wood.
Every timber frame project is certificated by a qualified industrial/
structural engineer and all timber frame structures which meet the
Scottish Consortium of Timber Frame Industries (Scotfi) standards are
marked with the Scotfi quality scheme symbol.
The aims of Scotfi include promoting the benefits of timber frame
construction to the public and to the construction industry. Scotfi also
cares about the quality of the product and service offered by its
members, who include most of the major timber frame makers and suppliers
in Scotland. All Scotfi manufacturing members are required to comply
with the organisation's quality scheme or British Standard 5750.
The energy efficiency and environmental friendliness of timber frame
is well documented. With the efficient use of domestic fuel, standard
insulation incorporated within the timber frame ensures excellent
thermal performance. While this energy efficiency of timber frames makes
it essentially a ''greener'' method of construction, the materials used
also contribute to a green profile such as renewable softwoods and
CFC-free insulation.
Perhaps one of the main benefits of timber frame is that it is an
accurate, factory manufactured product that is easy to erect, reducing
the need for special on-site skills.
For more information on all aspects of timber frame construction, call
Scotfi on 01786 445075 or write to Scotfi, John Player Building,
Springbank Road, Stirling, FK7 7RS.

DRUMCHAPEL's housing regeneration will be the talk of Venice today --
when Scotland's success in reviving run-down urban areas tops the agenda
at a social housing seminar there.
The event will be chaired by Scot David Orr, director of the Scottish
Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA), and will feature Drumchapel
as one of three international case studies.
Delegates from 25 European countries will attend the seminar which is
part of the General Assembly of CECODHAS, the European Liaison Committee
for Social Housing. They represent housing providers who collectively
house 100 million people, or 25% of Europe's population. Urban
regeneration has been one of the key themes and the subject of one of
six Europe-wide working parties looking at various housing issues.
David Orr says: ''We in Scotland have pioneered community control in
rebuilding communities. This seminar will allow us to take that message
to our colleagues throughout Europe, and to learn from their
experience.''
The Drumchapel programme will be represented by Jean McKinnon,
director of Cernach Housing Co-operative. She will stress the advantages
of tenant control. ''Community ownership in housing goes beyond
community consultation to community empowerment. Today, the
professionals are on tap, not on top. The tenants prioritise the way the
investment is spent. This tenant involvement will ensure lasting rather
than transitory benefits.''
The seminar will also consider examples from Holland and France and
will examine views of the European Commission and the Committee of the
Regions.

FINDING a suitable place to rent can be difficult, and out in the
islands it can become a real problem. Imagine then the delight of the
150 people who live on Berneray when their first-ever housing
association project was formally completed.
Not surprisingly, Scottish Homes chief executive Peter McKinlay left
Edinburgh to be on hand to mark the occasion. For the agency put up
almost #450,000 in grant aid, with #50,000 coming from private finance.
The end-product was eight new houses for rent, together with a new
Health Board treatment and waiting room.
The islanders had decided it was a good idea to get together and form
their own community-based Berneray Housing Association. They secured the
funding and saw the development completed within a two-year timescale.
''In many ways, this is a major event in Scottish housing,'' said
Peter McKinlay. ''We must congratulate all those who have helped to make
it happen.''
That included Tighean Innse Gall, the Western Isles Islands Council,
the Bank of Scotland, contractor D A Macfarlane, and the Western Isles
Health Board.
The new houses, he pointed out, were of good quality, good value, and
designed specifically to deal with the high exposure and particular
weather conditions experienced by Bernerary.
Housing association chair Fred Macleod added: ''The community of
Berneray is delighted that more affordable rented housing is now
available on the island.
''In order to retain the small but enthusiastic community, this
development was necessary. Completing the project has not been without
some struggle. But handing the keys to our first tenants has made it
worthwhile.''
The houses are, in fact, designed to what is termed barrier-free
standards. In simpler terms, it means they should be suitable for a
lifetime. No tiers of high stairs to deal with: no problems over access.
In short, no unnecessary barriers.
The houses are semi-detached, with two bedrooms, kitchen, living room,
bathroom. Weekly rent is on the #30 level, and the opportunity has been
taken in the overall design to include community aspects. These include
new treatment and waiting rooms and accommodation for the relief
district nurse.
The simple aim is to get new or improved housing, while making sure
that the quality of housing options and varieties available are
substantially improved.
''We seek to promote a more diverse housing sector, and make an
effective contribution to removing homelessness,'' says Mary Mowat, the
agency's communications manager.
''This was an important project, because it was local people deciding
they wanted to do something to improve the local situation. Everyone
here is delighted with the result. The keyword, of course, was
partnership.''

JUNIOR Home Office Minister Nicholas Baker has resigned his post on
medical advice, it was announced yesterday. He will be replaced by Mr
Tim Kirkhope.
However, Government sources said Mr Baker, the MP for Dorset North who
had a majority of 10,080 at the last election, was not expected to
resign his seat in the Commons.
No details were given about the nature of Mr Baker's illness, and
Downing Street said it was a ''private matter''.
Mr Baker has been an MP since 1979. He was only made a junior Minister
in 1994, after serving as a Government Whip since 1989.
Government sources said: ''Mr Baker has been told by his doctor that
he has to lighten his workload and should go to the back benches.''
In a statement, Mr Baker said he had been ''advised by doctors that an
extended period of rest from ministerial duties is required''.
Mr Baker, who said he would continue as an MP, added: ''On my return
to health, I hope once again to be of service to the Government.''
Mr Baker, 56, later declined to disclose what his medical problem was.
''I don't propose to say. It isn't that serious.
''I have been advised by doctors, if I want to get it right, to take
an extended period of rest from ministerial duties,'' he said. ''I'm
obeying doctors' orders reluctantly but sensibly I think.''
Asked whether he wanted to return to Government in future, he said:
''I hope to. That's in other people's hands whether I do or not.''
He would not be putting his feet up but continuing to carry out his
constituency work.''I've got a full programme,'' he said.
Mr Baker's replacement, Mr Kirkhope, 50, has been MP for Leeds North
East since 1987.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said he was ''very saddened'' at Mr
Baker's resignation.
Mr Baker was the Minister responsible for dealing with applications by
Mohamed al Fayed, the chairman of Harrods, and his brother Ali for
British citizenship. He rejected both men's applications in February.
Mr Baker also was in the process of framing new legislation designed
to stop racketeers who make millions of pounds out of arranging bogus
marriages for immigrants.

THE final proposals for a Scottish parliament
were set out yesterday in simultaneous announcements in Glasgow and
Westminster.
The parliament, as proposed by the Scottish Constitutional Convention,
would have 129 MPs who would effectively take over the powers of the
Secretary of State for Scotland. Seventy-three of the MPs would be
directly elected as at present, with 56 additonal MPs from party lists
to reflect the proportional vote for each party.
The scheme has been six years in the making by the Scottish
Constitutional Convention, which has the support of the Labour Party,
the Liberal Democrats, church and community groups, and the Scottish
TUC.
Labour has promised to use the plans as the basis of its legislatation
for a Scottish Parliament, if it is returned at the next election. The
Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also promised to use the party
lists to balance as far as possible the number of male and female MPs.
Although some original proposals have been watered down, the
convention has managed to produce a final document without its main
supporters falling out with each other, as had been widely predicted.
Finance would come from the present block grant from Westminster, with
the additional opportunity to vary income tax by 3p in the pound.
Canon Kenyon Wright, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
Constitutional Convention, said the proposed parliament would not be
perfect, but it would be both different from, and better than,
Westminster.
''It will doubtless make mistakes but they will be our mistakes and it
will be answerable for them to the people of Scotland. That is the first
and best reason for change,'' he said.
The proposals were immediately attacked by Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth who claimed such a parliament would wreck the Scottish economy
and destabilise the constitution.
His fierce response suggested the Conservatives would make Scotland's
constitutional future a leading issue of the next General Election
campaign.
Although the convention suggested that it is unlikely its tax-raising
power would be used without a great deal of caution and prudence, Mr
Forsyth seized upon it as his main thrust of attack, claiming the
''Tartan Tax'' would fuel wage demands, cost jobs, and drive away inward
investment.
The proposals would also marginalise the role of the Scottish
Secretary, and this too was attacked by Mr Forsyth, who claimed it would
leave Scotland with minimal representation and influence at Westminster.
He said: ''The Scottish Constitutional Convention has sold Scotland's
real interests down the river. Constant confrontation between the
Scottish parliament and Westminster would be inevitable.''
He added: ''It would have just enough power to wreck the Scottish
economy and destabilise the constitution. If malcontents in its ranks
exploit artificial grievances, it will lead Scotland down the path of
separatism to economic and social catastrophe.''
The Scottish Nationalists were equally scathing, with parliamentary
leader Margaret Ewing claiming it would be a ''puppet assembly, dancing
on the end of a Westminster string''.
Labour's Shadow Scots Secretary George Robertson argued the opposite,
claiming that a Scottish parliament would kill separatism stone dead and
strengthen the Union.
He argued that, with powers over health, housing, local government and
education, it would make a ''huge difference'' to the lives of millions
of ordinary Scots.
Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Jim Wallace said it was a historic
achievement, promising it would bring a new-style of politics to
Scotland.
The convention's report says such a parliament will improve the
Scottish economy, leading to more jobs and better wages.
However, a spokesman for leading Scottish company Scottish and
Newcastle said it would have to study the document before commenting
further, but in principle it would be concerned at the possibility of
tax rates and employments costs being higher in Scotland, which could
have an adverse effect on investment decisions.
The main points
* It will take over the powers of the Scottish Office including
education, law, health, local government, training, transport, planning,
the environment, and industry.
* Westminster will be left with defence, foreign affairs, immigration,
social security policy, and central economic policies.
* It will be financed by an assigned budget along the present lines
from Westminster along with the ability to vary income tax up or down by
3p in the pound.
* There will be 129 MPs, 73 elected from constituencies and the other
56 from party lists to ensure as far as possible equal numbers of men
and women, and parties having the same percentage of MPs as they have in
the overall vote.
* Parliament will meet in Edinburgh but with committees meeting
throughout Scotland so that the public can see it in action.
* It will have a fixed term of four years with full-time MPs meeting
during normal office hours to avoid the anti-social all-night sittings
of Westminster.

THE Government's decision to ban prescription of the widely abused
sleeping drug Temazepam in its gel-filled capsule form was greeted with
mixed feelings by MPs, drug workers and experts last night.
Announcing the move, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said the ban
was part of a crackdown on the availability of the drug among
non-legitimate users. GPs will not be able to prescribe the capsules
from January under the NHS.
The widely predicted step comes only a month after Temazepam,
Britain's most popular sleeping pill, was rescheduled as a class B drug,
making unlawful possession an offence.
Mr Forsyth said yesterday's UK-wide decision came after lengthy
consultations with the pharmaceutical industry, GPs and health
authorities. He said the decision should spell out to drug dealers that
the Government intended to get tougher on drug pushing.
''Although Temazepam brings relief to legitimate users, there is no
doubt that in Scotland the gel-filled capsules have created massive
profits for drug dealers and have been at the root of an appalling crime
wave,'' Mr Forsyth said.
''There is also evidence that the gel-filled capsules have been
responsible for devastating medical complications and addiction in
injecting drug misusers.
''All this has created misery and despair in our towns and cities, as
well as considerable difficulties for the police, and cannot be allowed
to continue.''
However, some drug experts warned that addicts, who melt down the
so-called jellies and inject the liquefied drug, would replace Temazepam
with an alternative.
There was also a call from Kilmarnock and Loudon MP Mr Willie McKelvey
for a complete ban on the drug in its hard tablet form.
Mr McKelvey said GPs in Scotland had exercised a voluntary ban on the
capsules during the past year but that addicts were inventive people
likely to turn to the tablet form.
0 The Scottish Drugs Forum in Glasgow also backed the call for a total
ban. The organisation's Mr David Liddell said the Government had to
focus its attention on the demand for drugs rather than their supply.
He said reducing the availability of one drug had little impact on
overall drug use. ''This was clearly illustrated in the past when
reducing the availability of heroin and temgesic did not lead to a
significant decline in the level of drug use.''
He said addicts would need help in coping with withdrawal as the drug
became harder to come by on the streets.
Edinburgh University's Professor Martin Plant, a World Health
Organisation drug researcher, said drug deaths were usually the result
of addicts taking a cocktail of substances.
The British Medical Association also greeted the ban in lukewarm
fashion, saying that Temazepam was a valuable drug for many sufferers.
The move was given a more enthusiastic welcome by Strathclyde police.
Superintendent Alastair McNaughton, of the force's anti-drugs campaign
unit, Operation Eagle, said stricter measures should dramatically reduce
the number of deaths.

SCOTTISH Nuclear's former director of safety is to give evidence to
MPs alleging that the privatisation programme for the nuclear
electricity generating industry is fraught with danger.
Captain Richard Killick is to go before a Commons committee to say he
fears low morale, overworked operators, and the rush to reduce costs
before privatisation pose a threat of a ''significant reduction in
safety''.
Labour's industry spokesman Brian Wilson last night described Capt
Killick's statement as ''utterly devastating'' and demanded that the
privatisation programme be halted.
Capt Killick, who spent 25 years in the Royal Navy's nuclear programme
before joining the company, claims that staff levels have been cut to a
minimum, forcing remaining employees to work ''in a state of overload''.
In a damaging criticism, he will warn that current pressure on
Scottish Nuclear's operators to achieve output targets are similar to
those that last month prompted a judge to impose a #250,000 fine on
Nuclear Electric for waiting nine hours before shutting down its Wylfa
station, after an accident.
In an interview with The Herald yesterday, he said: ''The effect of
privatisation on safety is going to mean that the energies of the senior
directors of the company, and the energies of the brightest staff within
the company, are invariably going to lie elsewhere other than the core
nuclear business. And this I think is going to undermine nuclear
safety.''
His concerns prompted him to approach Labour industry spokesman Brian
Wilson, who persuaded him to take his views to the powerful Commons
Select Committee on Trade and Industry, which is investigating nuclear
privatisation. He could be called to give evidence as early as next
week.
Last night, Mr Wilson called for nuclear privatisation to be
abandoned. He added: ''Robert Killick has no politicial axe to grind. He
is simply someone who has seen the whole show develop from the inside
and is thoroughly alarmed about what is going on. The whole country
should join him in that view.''
Capt Killick, who left Scottish Nuclear last month, said: ''Staff see
nothing is sacred. They see people going very fast. They've seen their
director of safety vanishing in a week. Under private ownership,
pressure to downsize and reduce costs will increase.
''We are approaching the stage at the moment where numbers are
somewhere near the minimum level. There is plenty of evidence around
that the existing people are in a near state of overload. The company
has not been successful in holding to its internal programmes and we are
in a state of potential overload.''
He added: ''Scottish Nuclear operators are fully aware of the
pressures to increase output. There are outputs to be met. They are
realisable but they do put pressures on people. It was in the back of
their minds two years ago at Wylfa and is in the back of the minds of
those at Scottish Nuclear. Those pressures haven't reduced over these
two years.''
Last May, the Government announced it would privatise both Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear under one name, British Energy. It hopes
to raise #3,500m from the sale, far less than the assets cost to build.
Capt Killick left Scottish Nuclear last month at the request of chief
executive Dr Robin Jeffrey. His post is being merged with another and he
was asked to accept redundancy with immediate effect. Yesterday, he
stressed he had no complaints over his treatment or the financial
settlement.
He added that safety was a difficult thing to quantify and was
concerned to avoid alarmist language. But he is convinced privatisation
will erode the safety culture.
He will present three concerns to the Trade and Industry Committee:
* That British Energy's interests are bound to lie elsewhere than in
nuclear. ''They are thinking about gas, they are thinking of overseas
developments and other diversifications. All those things are new and
exciting and my concern is that the nuclear side of it will become dull
and worthy, just churning out money to make everything possible,'' he
said.
''The board's interests will be on how to develop the company, which
does not include developing nuclear. The brightest staff will be put
into thinking up these new, exciting areas.''
In the longer term, he said, the lower levels of management will
realise that management is not interested in the nuclear business and
this will affect safety.
* That combining the role of chairman and chief executive is against
all current management practices, which decree that the roles should be
kept separate to maintain an essential degree of accountability.
''We have reversed that and combined all powers into one pair of hands
in a company where safety is paramount. This is dangerous. One of the
fundamental principles of nuclear safety is, if you've got key
decisions, don't allow a single person to make decisions on his own,
unchecked.''
* Who will the new owner be? Hundreds of thousands of small
shareholders would reduce oversight; a small number of institutional
shareholders would be intent on ''extracting maximum profit''; and a
single, possibly foreign owner, might have a radically different concept
of nuclear safety from the one that currently exists.
Capt Killick, 59, who is English, has spent half his life in Scotland.
His 25-year career in the Royal Navy was devoted almost entirely to the
nuclear submarine programme. He has held most of the top nuclear safety
jobs in Scotland. He was in at the start of the Royal Navy's nuclear
programme and was at the heart of the safety debates over Polaris.
He was director of Nuclear and Radiological Safety at Rosyth dockyards
before privatisation and was captain of the Clyde submarine base and the
senior officer in charge of nuclear safety there. Latterly, he was chief
staff officer to Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland.
In 1991, he joined Scottish Nuclear and, in 1992, became its director
of safety.
Meanwhile, the Government has decided to pay the costs of insuring
British Energy against claims for serious accidents or commercial
failures worth more than #140m.
Insurance companies have made it clear they are unwilling to take on
unlimited liability for insuring nuclear facilities. The decision could
face opposition from Brussels because it would leave a sold-off British
Energy as the only one of the privatised utilities still receiving state
subsidy.

SITTING above the town on its craggy precipice, it's hard to imagine
Stirling Castle ever having changed. Scotland's finest example of
renaissance architecture, the very epicentre of Scotland's history for
over four centuries seems quite timeless.
Yet change has been a constant experience at the castle, not least in
the nineteenth century when alterations were made to some of the fine
historic apartments to accommodate the local ''Stirling Militia'', which
in time was to become the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Tunes of
glory were played out on the field of battle, but the castle was
subjected to a distinctly inglorious treatment of mezzanine floors,
replacement roofs, and internal partitions.
Since the army moved out in 1964, tourism has become our major
national industry and Stirling Castle, with its famous architecture,
superb views and its central role in Scottish history, has been bursting
with potential. The opportunity has been grasped by the Scottish
Office-led Stirling Initiative. Never since it was built has the castle
undergone so much change as now, under the Initiative. In a #21m
programme of restoration, conservation and new development, Historic
Scotland has already transformed Stirling Castle from a state of
museum-like lifelessness into one of the UK's most exciting and
evocative visitor attractions.
Despite the ongoing works, the visitor experience at the castle has
never been better. Where previously there were barren-vaulted chambers,
now there are attractive visual displays and video presentations,
bringing life to the castle's past as a royal palace and a defended
garrison. The castle kitchens have been re-created in their original
location, and they once again bustle with servants, cooks, game-birds,
oil lamps and even some rather interesting cooking smells of the period.
Features such as these are expected of an international-level visitor
attraction nowadays, but what will make Stirling Castle really unique in
the longer term is the painstaking and expensive restoration of the
historic apartments.
The Great Hall, constructed by James IV in the early 1500s, was
adapted for use by the Army and suffered the insertion of mezzanine
floors, internal staircases and the construction of a new roof six feet
higher than the original. Photographs from earlier this century show
rows of army bunks in what must have been a draughty dormitory, albeit
with fine views.
Restoration is now well advanced, and the Great Hall's impressive
volume is being appreciated for the first time since the end of the
eighteenth century. Stonework around the huge fireplaces and the great
west window have been restored, and Scottish oak has been cut from the
forest of Strathyre to furnish a new hammerbeam timber roof in the style
of the original.
And of course, as we must all be aware, the Great Hall was the
atmospheric venue for the party which followed the evening premiere of
Braveheart. For the first time in centuries the ancient walls
reverberated to music and dancing as they were originally intended to
do. When the restoration is complete in 1999 Stirling will have a unique
asset in the Great Hall, and bookings are already being taken by
Historic Scotland for functions well into the future.
Meanwhile, work has started on the restoration of the Chapel Royal,
built by James VI in 1594 for the baptism of his son Henry. The
nineteenth-century roof is being replaced with one of more authentic
design, and the sixteenth-century interior painted decoration is being
restored to recreate the original atmosphere of the chapel. Opening to
the public is planned for March next year.
Anyone who hasn't visited Stirling Castle for a few years should
consider taking another look. A new 100-seat cafe-restaurant is priced
just right for the family day out, and is a big improvement on the
original castle tea-room. And one of the best things about the castle
now is what lies outside it -- attractive new streetscapes of granite,
whin and Caithness stone, and an ''Old Town'' which is acquiring a
steady stream of coffee-shops, restaurants, galleries and other
specialist shops. All at once, it seems, the Stirling Initiative is
breathing new life into the castle and Old Town.

FROM the Initiative's earliest days it was clear that local residents
would have an important part to play in the process of change.
Partnership projects in other parts of Britain have emphasised
''informing'' the local community, leaving them to influence events
through the normal planning process. Not so in Stirling, where the
partners in the Stirling Initiative set out to ensure active involvement
by residents and local businesses in project discussions, allowing them
the opportunity to influence the decision process before projects
reached the planning stage.
Local residents are represented on the Initiative's working groups
through a specially created community forum. Local businesses are
represented by Stirling's town centre manager Tom Moore, who has close
links with the town centre traders who are, of course, profoundly
affected by the Initiative.
The community forum's chairman, John Docherty, has been closely
involved since the birth of the initiative and now sits on Stirling
Initiative's main management group.
''We've found that a democratic structure works best in this
situation. The community councils are kept informed through the members
they send along to our meetings and the Initiative's working groups.''

IN recent years the supply of housing in Stirling has been unable to
keep pace with a steadily growing demand, from local people and from
incomers. The Stirling Initiative is addressing this shortfall through
its housing development programme which is being delivered under a
strategic agreement between Scottish Homes and Stirling District
Council.
By April 1995, 214 new homes had been built in the six housing
development projects so far completed in the initiative. Of these, 125
were completed during 1994/95. The housing programme is constantly
evolving, however. Projects put in the pipeline in April this year are
expected to create some 526 new homes in Stirling during the
initiative's first five years from 1993 to 1998.
Stirling District Council also continued its programme of refurbishing
tenement properties in the town centre. Thirteen buildings have now been
refurbished under the initiative, of which seven were completed during
the year. A total of 103 homes have now been upgraded with roof
renewals, rot eradication, re-wiring, re-plumbing, and improved common
stairs and landings. A further 10 buildings have been identified for
improvement, and the list is likely to be further extended in the coming
year.
Scottish Homes' district manager Jack Hunter emphasises the role that
new housing has to play in the revitalisation of Stirling's economy:
''The Stirling Initiative is well known for its achievements in tourist
and retail development, but the partnership is equally committed to
improving the quality of life for local people.
''Scottish Homes is working closely with its partners to increase the
supply of housing for local needs, and at the same time filling in some
unattractive gap sites around the town.''
Projects on which work was carried out during the year included:
* Annfield Gardens. The development by Cala Homes of 91 middle to
upper range houses was substantially completed.
* Riverside (cooperage site). Site acquisition by Forth Valley
Enterprise and Stirling District Council was substantially completed and
site investigations were commissioned. Proposals will be finalised and
construction is expected to begin in the coming year.
* Irvine Place. In January construction started on a new development
of 10 flats for Forth Housing Association, with Scottish Homes as the
main funder. Completion is expected in September 1995.
* Lawsons building/Baker Street car park. Proposals were developed for
the construction of 25 to 30 flats with two retail units in a prominent
gap site in the Old Town. Construction is expected to begin in 1995/96.
* Whinwell Road. Twenty four serviced and part-furnished two-bedroom
flats were completed for Link Housing Association in a project jointly
funded by Scottish Homes, Forth Valley Enterprise and the National
Westminster Bank.
* Burghmuir Road (dairy site). The site was acquired and cleared for
development by Quality Street. Construction of 20 flats for market rent
is expected to begin in 1995/96.

STIRLING lies, famously, between a rock and a wet place -- the Castle
Rock and the River Forth. Constrained by its geography, and by its
ancient street pattern, it's hardly surprising that today one of the
town's biggest problems is a shortage of good land for development close
to the town centre.
Strange, therefore, that even today, 15 acres of good level land
between the railway station and the riverbank should be virtually unused
and largely derelict.
Of course, site development in town centres is no straightforward
business. The 15 acres in question was in multiple ownership, which
means a headache for any organisation trying to put together a large
project. Worse still, there is no road access to the site, the kiss of
death to practically any project you could name.
But such a large area, immediately adjacent to the town centre, was
just too tempting to ignore for a partnership which urgently wants to
increase the employment and income-generating potential of the town.
The development of Forthside, as the site is known, is the Stirling
Initiative's flagship project in the lower part of the town. Of all the
initiative's projects, this is the one which has most potential to bring
a significant change in the town's economic fortunes and to its
employment and business profiles.
Forth Valley Enterprise has now, with the backing of its partners,
started the process of acquiring land and preparing proposals for
development.
Investment in the area is likely to reflect needs which are already
well recognised -- a hotel seems possible, and probably some housing.
Crucially, the new development will mean that for the first time in many
generations, local people will have access to and the riverbank which
will be attractively landscaped with foot and cycle paths giving
pedestrian access.
However, Forthside can only achieve its full potential if good road
access is provided.Central Regional Council has now let the contract for
a new #4m eastern access road -- a project made possible by special
additional borrowing consent from the Scottish Office -- and it is due
to be completed in 1998.
As well as providing commercial access to the site, the new road which
will do much to relieve the growing problems of traffic congestion at
the main access points to Stirling's town centre.
It will also create access to more than 60 acres of land currently
owned by the Ministry of Defence, much of which is expected to be
released as surplus to their requirements. As such, the job-creating
potential of the new road is very substantial in the short and long
term.
The road is not yet completed, and development is not yet started on
the site. However, it is quite clear that Over the next few years
Forthside will contribute hugely to the growing appeal and prosperity of
Stirling. It is also, one suspects, a useful case study of successful
co-operation between a local enterprise company and local government
working together to deliver a project which, for any one agency working
alone, would scarcely have been achievable.
FVE's chief executive, Bill Morton said: ''The 15 acres of Forthside
holds immense potential for attracting new jobs to Stirling. The site is
hugely attractive, overlooking the river and having views up to the
castle. We will be working with our partners in the Initiative to
attract the best possible investment to Forthside for Stirling.''

ARRIVE in Stirling by train and you'll see a problem right away. You
walk out of the attractive grade one listed building into an unwelcoming
urban scene of motor cars, steel barrier fences and traffic lights.
Directly opposite is a mix of low unappealing properties, inter-war
and post-war creations, piecemeal developments attracted by proximity to
the station. Beyond them, closer to the skyline, the backs of tenements
on Barnton Street do little to relieve the unpleasantness of the
foreground. The traveller by train faces a challenge to find his way
into Stirling's town centre.
Small wonder that the Stirling Initiative is tackling this one
head-on, with a holistic approach aimed at putting right the effects of
unco-ordinated planning and development in the first half of this
century.
The partners, led by Forth Valley Enterprise, are hoping to create a
pedestrianised area in front of the station and to redevelop the
adjacent sites to create a new Station Square.
The station has, over the years, become cut off from the rest of the
town by traffic flows. The new project will re-attach the station to the
town, easing pedestrian access between the two by developing physical
linkages, and effectively increasing the size of the town centre.
It sounds simple enough, but the complexities of delivering a project
of this scale in a town centre such as Stirling are enormous. Only close
co-operation between region, district and Forth Valley Enterprise, in
this case through the working groups of Stirling Initiative, have made
it achievable. The first demolition contracts are expected to be awarded
before the end of this year.
Bill Morton, Forth Valley Enterprise's chief executive said: ''Our
partnership aim is to turn a number of outdated properties and a busy
main road into an urban square free of traffic and with an attractive
continental-style ambience. In doing so, we will improve the quality of
environment for residents and visitors in Stirling.''

ENVIRONMENTAL improvement is high on the Stirling Initiative's agenda
for improving the town's appeal to visitors. Of course this is also true
in many other towns, but it takes on a special meaning when much of the
environment in question dates from the 17th and 18th centuries.
The partners' aim is to bring about a sea-change in the character and
mood of Stirling's Old Town, turning an area of mostly council housing
and long-term on-street parking into one of opportunity for tourism
businesses and special appeal for visitors. The task has had to be
tackled with sensitivity, taking into account the needs of local tenants
and the strong loyalty which is felt to the Rock on which the Old Town
is built.
The first projects are already completed. Anyone visiting the Castle
in recent years will have been struck by the ''unfortunate'' state of
the approach road. Decaying, cracked pavements and tarmacadam road
surfaces lined with lampposts of varying vintages and angles to the
vertical, all set off by an unsightly concrete public toilet block. But
no more.
How things have changed in the past 12 months. The pavements are of
finest Caithness stone, the road surface is of traditional granite
cobbles, and that toilet block has gone. Now, somehow, the visitor feels
that up this hill may indeed be one of Scotland's finest historic
monuments.
This approach is being adopted throughout the Old Town, replacing the
old inter-war streetscapes with natural materials more in keeping with
the character of Scotland's ancient capital.
Stirling's famous Church of the Holy Rude, subject of a major
restoration project by Historic Scotland in recent years, now has a
comprehensively relandscaped forecourt with period railings, a Caithness
stone driveway, and new floodlighting.
But the biggest and most ambitious of the environmental improvements
is the #1m programme of works which started in January in the heart of
the Old Town. Broad Street is to be the starting point for a
comprehensive revamp of streetscapes in this old quarter over the next
year.
The initiative's plan is to focus the early commercial tourism
developed in Broad Street itself with a growing customer base among
people exploring the Old Town, the Castle and visitor centre. With
commendable vision the district council, which owns most of the
properties, has been redeveloping ground floor flats for retail use as
and when they become available.
The streets in this part of the town are already taking on a wholly
new appearance. The style and materials used in the approaches to the
Castle will be extended throughout the area, introducing attractive
cobbles, stone, iron work and street furniture more appropriate to the
setting.
Trees, grass and other soft landscaping will be complemented by the
town's Civic Pride scheme which provides floral arrangements and window
boxes for residents' use.
The project is being led by Forth Valley Enterprise, with major
contributions from Stirling District Council and the European Regional
Development Fund. The designs for the scheme were drawn up by Ian Whyte
Associates, a Stirling firm with a growing international reputation for
landscape architecture in sensitive historic areas.
Forth Valley Enterprise chief executive Bill Morton is clear about the
future of the Old Town: ''Stirling's Old Town is blessed with superb
traditional architecture and individual period attractions which are the
envy of most historic towns. It was vital to improve the general
environment of the streets themselves to make sure the appeal to
visitors and tourists is strong.
''Stirling's prospects have never been better than at present and
there is growing interest from businesses interested in locating in the
area.''
Fundamental to the Stirling Initiative is the desire to see benefits
going to local people as soon as possible. An Adult Training Scheme for
Stirling's Old Town, funded jointly by Stirling District Council and
Forth Valley Enterprise, is aimed at doing exactly that. The scheme has
now been operating for a year and is giving 12 local unemployed people
the chance to learn practical skills (such as metalworking,
stone-masonry and landscaping) whilst carrying out a number of local
environmental improvements.

Last year 600 cars an hour were passing through Stirling town centre
bringing chaos, noise and pollution, however, the pedestrian has now
become king of the road following the introduction of a scheme that
keeps cars out of the core shopping areas until after 5pm
THE rate of increase in private car ownership has been an ongoing
problem for roads and traffic managers in cities all over the world.
Somehow, in the big cities, we've come to expect and live with traffic
congestion.
In the smaller historic towns and burghs there has never been such an
easy acceptance of fate. Because of their limited capacity for wheeled
traffic, such towns have been in the forefront of the painful conflict
between cars and the urban environment.
Until July this year, Stirling was a victim of the motor car. Its
street system was originally designed to accommodate horse-drawn
traffic, but last year those same streets were funnelling up to 600
vehicles an hour through the centre of town, creating noise and air
pollution and intimidating shoppers who had to dodge parked and moving
cars just to cross the street.
The commercial core was suffering an advanced form of urban
arteriosclerosis. The generally rundown appearance of the town, together
with mobility hazards for pedestrians, was restricting trading
potential, and ultimately the town's ability to attract investment.
To the consumer, Stirling's appeal, which had been so strong in the
seventies and eighties, was fading as attractive new shopping centres
sprang up elsewhere in the catchment area. Most worrying of all,
Stirling's traders were losing the local custom on which they depended
for survival.
These are the problems which the Stirling Initiative partnership is
now tackling through a wide-ranging programme of projects in the town
centre.
''Pedestrian priority'' has, from July this year, been introduced to
the main shopping streets of King Street and Murray Place, effectively
keeping private cars out of the core shopping area until after 5pm.
Round-the-clock access is still allowed for buses, and special
provisions are in place for disabled red badge holders. The net effect
is a much safer, quieter and more pedestrian-friendly environment in
downtown Stirling.
Equally striking, Central Regional Council has just completed a
comprehensive renewal of the streetscapes in the centre of town. The
ageing unsightly tarmacadam and paving slabs have been replaced with
attractive new materials and street furniture. The original cobbles have
been lifted, scarified (to reduce slippiness when wet), and relaid in a
scheme which is modern and attractive yet succeeds in retaining the feel
of a historic town.
Security for shoppers and traders has also been stepped up with the
introduction of closed-circuit television, controlled from Stirling's
main police station at Randolphfield. The 39 security cameras which
extend throughout the town centre have already brought about a marked
reduction in crime in the area.
The result is that visitors are now rediscovering the joys of shopping
in an attractive and peaceful historic town. The response from traders
has been encouraging -- major new investment from Marks &amp; Spencer and
the opening of a new BhS store and, according to initiative director
James Maxwell, interest from other retailers is building up rapidly.
As the physical form of Stirling's town centre changes, the Initiative
partnership is now focused on providing business support for its
community of small, locally owned businesses who will no doubt be facing
a more competitive environment in the future. Stirling has a wealth of
such businesses adding colour, variety, and charm to the historic
streets, and the Initiative's aim is to encourage their survival and
growth through a period of rapid change.
The first priority is to ensure properties are structurally sound,
vital if traders are to take the long-term view. Stirling District
Council has embarked on a major programme of property improvement in the
town centre, comprehensively upgrading the treasure trove of tenements,
refurbishing residential flats on upper floors and ensuring the
ground-floor shops are brought up to standard. The result is a steadily
growing supply of quality retail premises in attractive locations.
Predictably, interest is rising from retailers not yet represented in
Stirling.
The Initiative's approach is to help businesses to help themselves.
The tenement refurbishments are based on a proportion being paid by the
owners. A major programme of tenement face-lifting led by Forth Valley
Enterprise is run on the same basis. And now a new scheme to renew and
repair the shop fronts in the town centre is offering grants from 50% to
70% to traders who want to improve the look of their premises. The aim
is to re-introduce the traditional style of frontage, and at the same
time encourage the individuality which is so attractive in historic
towns.
The package of assistance for traders is likely to increase further in
the near future as the Initiative partners are working with the town
centre manager, Tom Moore, towards providing help with business strategy
and marketing. Mr Moore said: ''Stirling town centre is changing
dramatically. The best historic aspects are being retained to ensure the
town remains unique, whilst other improvements are bringing us up to the
highest standards of town centre shopping. There's never been a better
time for retail and leisure businesses to invest here.''
LIKE many historic towns, Stirling finds it difficult to accommodate
the growing number of private cars on the road. One of Central Regional
Council's most important contributions to the Stirling Initiative has
been a thorough review of traffic flows and parking which have long been
problematic in the town.
The plan which is now being implemented recognises that people drive
cars for a variety of reasons, and are therefore best served by a range
of parking options.
For the foreseeable future there will be demand for parking in or very
close to the main shopping and business area. In Stirling such parking
has been at a premium for many years, and has tended to overflow into
the mainly residential Old Town area.
The opening earlier this year of the new 550-space NCP car park in
Wellgreen Road, close to the Thistle Centre, has done much to improve
parking convenience for shoppers. Developments such as this have cleared
the way for improved parking controls in the Old Town, including
dedicated parking for residents there.
However, as in towns everywhere, the scope for town centre parking is
limited and falls short of projected demand, particularly given the
growing number of tourists visiting Stirling. Some travellers are
expected to switch to public transport, but for many people the answer
in the longer term is likely to be Park-and-Ride. This operates very
successfully south of the Border where, as in York, a fast, efficient
and cost-effective bus service links peripheral car parks with the
centre of town.
A similar system is expected to be introduced in Stirling from next
year when the first of two peripheral car parks will be opened at
Milhall, on the road into town from Edinburgh. The evidence from most
other towns is that Park-and-Ride is well used by a wide range of
drivers, including commuters and those visiting the town for shopping
and leisure reasons.
The targeted reduction in private car traffic in the town centre is
being balanced by improvements to the public transport network. A
16-stance bus station is planned for construction soon. Close to the
heart of the town, the bus station will have a modern reception area and
cafe, replacing the antiquated and cramped facility which served
Stirling for many years.
Corrie McChord, leader of Central Regional Council and the incoming
Stirling Council, said: ''Stirling has similar problems to other
historic towns in that it cannot go on indefinitely absorbing the
increases in road traffic. The changes we're making to the local road
system, to the parking regime and to the physical environment, have
already made Stirling a more pedestrian-friendly town and that's
something we'll continue to work on.''

HOUSEPROUD James Harkins has put the final seal on his award-winning
ways. For the Adam Homes site manager has built on his outstanding NHBC
Pride in the Job quality award of this summer by beating off competition
from all over Scotland to win a Seal of Excellence in the regional
finals.
To industry insiders that achievement means he excels at overseeing
every aspect of new-house construction and man-management at the
company's Bearsden site in Glasgow; more important, to the housebuyer it
means Adam homes not only look good but are built to the highest
technical standards.
His success at both levels of the Pride in the Job awards, established
to foster quality construction and reward commitment to quality
workmanship, underlines what owners and potential buyers have been
saying all year about Adam Homes' prestigious #6.5m development of
luxury flats and houses at Henderland Gate.
''I'm obviously delighted,'' said James, 37, a family man from
Bishopbriggs who has been in the trade for 21 years, the last eight as a
site manager. ''Quality is vital at the top end of the market. You
really have to earn a reputation, and Adam Homes has done just that, its
success being based on word-of-mouth recommendations.''
Managing director David Nelson was overjoyed for his site manager:
''The previous award was a quality award, the winners of which went
through to the Scottish stage of the Pride in the Job competition. James
was one of only 15 out of 1500 in Scotland to be awarded a Seal of
Excellence at a ceremony held in Edinburgh's Sheraton Grand Hotel
recently.''
The Seal of Excellence was presented to James Harkins by Tony Allen,
chief executive of the NHBC, who said: ''Pride in the Job is now
established as the premier quality awards scheme in the UK new
house-building industry. The key objective is to improve the quality of
construction in new homes by encouraging and supporting those at the
sharp end of the industry in their pursuit of excellence.
''With the backing and whole-hearted support of house builders,
dedicated site teams and the NHBC, Pride in the Job award winners
consistently demonstrate skills which go beyond the call of normal duty.
Their commitment to quality workmanship brings great credit not only to
themselves but to our industry as a whole.''
As Tony Allen pointed out, the award also reflects the company's
commitment to quality. David Nelson said: ''We think we have a winning
package at Henderland Gate. The site has been complimented by visitors
and potential buyers all summer, and the NHBC awards are a real bonus.
Considering the number of quality house builders in Milngavie and
Bearsden, we are delighted to be the only company in the area to figure
in either of this year's awards.''
Henderland Gate -- set in tranquil surroundings just off the
Switchback, with splendid views over the surrounding area to the Erskine
Bridge and Clyde estuary -- comprises a range of two and three-bedroom
flats (28 in all) and 15 four and five-bedroom detached homes. The site
is close to shopping and transport facilities as well as being within
easy reach of the city centre. Prices are from #98,000 for a two-bedroom
flat and from #198,000 for the Braemar four-bedroom detached villa.
All properties offer exceptionally spacious accommodation. In the
villas the rooms are generally much larger than usual, and the double
doors into the lounge, the patio doors in the dining room, the generous
hallways on both ground and upper level, the large en-suites, and the
extensive landscaped gardens all serve to give a feeling of space.
The high level of specification includes a choice of stylish bathrooms
and fully equipped quality kitchens -- designed to maximise on space and
storage; and living flame fires. The developers also offer a carpets and
curtains package.
The first phase of flats is now complete and occupied and the second
and final phase has just been released. Half of the apartments have
already been reserved and will be available for entry next spring.
All flats have a balcony leading off the lounge, most with a stunning
view; satellite television is standard and there is an aerial point in
every room; the kitchens are designed to accommodate a table for dining.
''The flats have been selling so quickly that we haven't had time to
have a showflat, but we do have a completed flat which people can look
round,'' said David Nelson.
In fact the success of the site in general has created a minor
accommodation crisis for Adam Homes, and site sales manager Julie Martin
in particular. For not only has the showhome-cum-sales-office -- a
five-bedroom Carnoustie detached villa with interior design by Decorum
of Sauchiehall Street -- been sold, but its replacement, a four-bedroom
Anstruther villa, has also been snapped up.
''We were nearly finished preparing the second showhome when it too
was reserved. It means we don't have a fully furnished showhouse at the
moment but luckily there is a completed property available for
viewing.''
Temporary accommodation has been found for ''homeless'' Julie --
''unfortunately it's back in the sales cabin she occupied when we first
started work on the site,'' said David Nelson. ''But it is only
temporary, until we can get another house prepared as a showhome.''
And provided no-one buys that house too.

Stirling's Old Town is full of surprises -- the Initiative aims to
make it an important part of the town's future
HIDDEN away among the winding streets of Stirling's Old Town are some
of Scotland's finest architectural treasures which, one by one, are
being opened for the public to enjoy through the Stirling Initiative.
Over the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Old Town
of Stirling grew up close to the castle, housing the professionals,
merchants, and others who made Stirling the commercial and
administrative focus of the surrounding area.
The buildings of that time reflected the status and wealth of the
people who lived in them, and of the town as a whole. The Royal Burgh of
Stirling, with its fine architecture and bustling market, rivalled
Edinburgh in importance.
In the nineteenth century the town's centre of gravity shifted away
from the narrow ''top of the town'' streets towards more level land
where the railway station was giving rise to new business opportunities.
This change marked the start of a long period of decline in the Old Town
which is only now being reversed by the Stirling Initiative.
Today some of Scotland's finest historic buildings are being brought
back into use, giving visitors the chance to see life as it was lived in
seventeenth-century Scotland.
The life of the monarchy will be on view in the #20m restoration and
refurbishment of Stirling Castle, including a reconstruction of the
original royal apartments (royalty here referring to the Stuarts of
course), the Great Hall, the chapel royal and even the great kitchens
which provided for the royal household.
In the Old Town itself, restoration and development works have focused
on a number of fine historic buildings:
Close to the esplanade, overlooking the town, is Argyll's Lodging. A
magnificent seventeenth-century courtyard house, modestly nestling
behind attractive iron gates, it was in use until 1991 as Stirling's
youth hostel. With its distinctive pink rendering and renaissance
decoration the ''ludgings'', as it was known locally, is the finest
remaining example in Scotland of a seventeenth-century nobleman's house.
The house dates from 1632 when it was built as a residence for Sir
William Alexander of Menstrie, the Secretary of State for Scotland and
soon to be the first Earl of Stirling. In 1666, it passed into the hands
of the Campbell family, and served as the headquarters of the second
Duke of Argyll before the Battle of Sherrifmuir in 1715.
Argyll's Lodging is now in the possession of Historic Scotland, which
is working closely with the other initiative partners to breathe life
back into its old walls. The central apartments are soon to be renovated
to accommodate a reconstruction of the main living quarters as they
would have appeared in the middle of the seventeenth century.
Parts of the building will, from next year, be home to Stirling
University's new Institute for International Scottish Studies. Under the
direction of Dr Rory Watson, the institute will provide a focus for the
study of Scottish culture at home and abroad.
Funding for the Argyll's Lodging project is coming from the initiative
partners, Historic Scotland, Forth Valley Enterprise, Stirling District
and Central Region, from the European Regional Development Fund, and
from a major appeal fund being set up by the University of Stirling to
support the institute.
Stirling's Old Town jail, another long-neglected ruin in the oldest
part of town, is being brought back to life in a #2.5m investment by
Stirling District Council, Forth Valley Enterprise, and the European
Regional Development Fund.
Built originally in 1847 as a model town prison to replace the
notorious tolbooth jail, the building was commandeered in 1888 by the
Ministry of War for use as a military prison.
In 1935 its life as a prison ended, and during the Second World War it
was used as the town's civil defence headquarters before finally seeing
service as a sweet factory.
Having stood empty and deteriorating for over 30 years, it was bought
in 1986 by Stirling District Council with a view to developing it as a
tourist attraction. The advent of the Stirling Initiative partnership
has allowed the development to proceed, with the aim of creating an
attraction to catch the imagination of the most discerning visitors.
The upper floors are being converted into a managed business centre,
with centralised office facilities and individual office units in what
were the prison cells. The location in Stirling's historic Old Town is
already attracting interest from a range of business types, and it is
expected that the offices will be mostly let when the development is
completed.

BUYERS flitting into a Laing Homes scheme won't have to worry about
packing the old goods and chattels.
Two-bedroom flats at the firm's Quayside Crescent development in Yoker
(left) come with a wall-to-wall furnishing package. Buyers can choose
from three different house styles and prices start at #45,500.
And Tilbury Douglas is offering furniture and carpets to anyone buying
one of its remaining homes in the Heathfield Estate development at Ayr.
Each buyer will get a voucher for #4000 from Reid Furniture.
Tilbury's marketing director, Jan Jeram, says: ''Many new customers
are keen to buy new furniture for their new homes. With this offer, they
can really splash out.''
Heathfield Estate has 74 two- and three-bedroom semi-detached villas
and three and four bedroom detached villas (prices from #55,495).

* A PAIR OF BEAUTIES: Keeping Up with the Joneses should not be too
difficult in this classic stone terrace in Glasgow's West End -- where
two impressive conversions are for sale at similar prices right next

A LEADING Scottish builder is pouring cold water on statistics which
claim Scotland is outperforming the rest of the country. His views are
backed by a former chairman of the Conservative Party who is calling on
the Chancellor to take urgent action in the November Budget to help the
enfeebled property market.
The latest figures from the National House-Building Council indicate
that private house-building dropped by an average of 18% throughout
Britain in the third quarter of this year, compared with the same period
in 1994.
The report says that only Scotland saw an increase in activity, with
4% more new-house registrations (4,400) than in the third quarter of
1994 (4,230). Builders have to register houses with the NHBC some 21
days before the start of construction.
But the president of the Scottish House Builders' Association, Sid
Fowler of L&amp;C Homes, says the NHBC statistics present a rosy picture
which is not matched by the experience of his members on the ground --
''I've challenged these Scottish figures. They fly in the eye of what my
colleagues north of the Border are telling me. I'm not the only one who
is sceptical about this apparent healthy situation.''
He speculates that that the Scottish figures have been artificially
boosted through builders increasing their registrations to meet
end-of-season targets, but that many of these houses might not get built
for some time. He would prefer to see statistics on house completions or
actual sales, rather than registrations which might only indicate a
potential for construction.
''The truth is that there has never been a better time to buy,'' he
says. ''Prices are low and mortgage rates are low, but these arguments
are not holding water with the public. I wish I could find some way of
talking this market up, but people want to sell before they buy and that
is creating a major log-jam in the market.''
Fowler says that, after a flying start to the year, the Scottish new
homes market was evaporating by May. ''Look at the annual reports from
the big builders. Only Barratt is reporting strong profits while many
others are making losses, or are only slightly in the black. Builders
are saying 'Oh my God, things seem to be getting worse!' ''
But he is optimistic about the future. ''Things are not good, but
we've got to go forward. People still want to own their own homes but
they have been given too many kicks in the teeth recently.
''The state of the economy has dulled people's entrepreneurial or
risk-taking edge. But most builders are not pulling the plug and saying
'Sod it, we're off out of this'. We've got a living to make and property
has a future.''
Defending the statistics, Eric Purves, the NHBC's Scottish director,
says that registrations are an important indicator of the building
industry's plans.
''Builders have to pay to register a house with us, so we take
registration as an intent to build -- otherwise, why would they pay a
registration fee?''
But he concedes that the latest upbeat Scottish figures might not be
an accurate pointer as to where the market is going. ''Our statistics
reflect the past, right up until the latest quarter. The latest results
are good news for Scotland -- but they don't necessarily reflect the
future.
''It's fair to say that builders have a much better idea of the future
than we do. If people like Sid Fowler are gloomy about what's going on,
it's because they fear things are going to get worse.''
Commenting on the UK figures, NHBC chairman Sir Norman Fowler MP said:
''These figures show the housing market to be on the verge of crisis.
For the second month running new housing starts by UK house builders are
down by 20%. Most builders are now experiencing a very difficult market.
Some have cut their losses and pulled out of house building altogether.
''The bleak fact is that over the last 12 months the housing market
has deteriorated.''
Calling on the Chancellor to take action in next month's Budget to
avert the threatening crisis, Sir Norman said: ''The obvious step is a
scheme to help the first-time buyer. One which increased the rate of
mortgage relief to 25% and increased MIRAS to, say, #40,000 would help
not only the first-time buyer but would also have a knock-on effect
throughout the market.''
Ironically, the lack of activity in the first-time buyers sector comes
at a time when the entry costs at the bottom end of the market are
exceptionally low.
The NHBC's First Time Buyers' Ability to Buy Index currently stands at
121, its highest level since it was introduced 20 years ago. The higher
the figure the easier, in theory, it is for first-timers to enter the
market. The Index takes a clutch of factors into account including
deposits, average income, and mortgage repayments.

We have tremendous assets in the architecture and character of the
town
THANKS to the initiative partnership, Stirling, with its glorious
castle, strong historical associations and magnificent architecture is
on the brink of joining the most attractive historic towns in Europe.
James Fraser, area tourist board director, said: ''It's all about
creating reasons to attract visitors to the town and encourage them to
linger longer and spend more. We have tremendous architectural and
historic assets and an attractive mix of shops and tourist accommodation
which gives us a solid base on which to build a successful tourist
industry.
''Our task in recent years has been to make the most of these assets
by sensitively developing new visitor attractions and facilities, and
encouraging tourism businesses to locate and expand in the town. Above
all we are striving to encourage more visitors to come to Stirling
outside the peak season, and to stay longer in the town.''
Of course Stirling is already an important tourist centre and has been
for many years. Stirling Castle is this year expected to attract more
than 300,000 visitors for the first time ever.
The creation of new visitor attractions and facilities on a large
scale and at the highest quality is about to revolutionise the standing
of Scotland's ancient capital in the world of tourism and leisure.
In the castle itself, Historic Scotland is spending over #21m on new
visitor facilities and the restoration of the important historic
apartments and buildings.
One of the most visionary projects has been the #300,000
transformation of the White House on the Castle Esplanade into a
state-of-the-art visitor centre. At no charge, visitors walking down
from the esplanade now have the chance to acquaint themselves in advance
with the treasures of Stirling by watching a 10-minute video
presentation in a choice of five languages.
The new centre, jointly funded by the district and regional councils
with European support, is already playing a vital role in encouraging
visitors at the castle to explore other parts of the town.
For those who prefer to do less walking, the Castle Shuttle provides a
cheap and convenient way to tackle the gradients during the summer
season. Between May and September a specially adapted coach covers the
route between the castle and the railway station. A special discount
ticket has been introduced to encourage visitors to explore a wide range
of attractions including the tourist bus services which run during the
summer.
Marketing will be a vital element in developing the tourism scene in
Stirling, and proposals are now being drawn up for a range of activities
including historically-themed events to take place over the next three
years.
Stirling District Provost Pat Greenhill said: ''With the opening of
the Old Town Jail and Argyll's Lodging in time for next season, Stirling
will be a great day out for local people, a 'must see' for those on
holiday, and is bristling with new opportunities for businesses involved
with retailing or the tourism industry.''

ENGLISH families are bombarding a leading Scottish housebuilder with
sales enquiries after two Hollywood blockbuster films left them dreaming
of a home in the Highlands.
Since they hit the screens, the movies -- Rob Roy, starring Liam
Neeson, and Braveheart, with action hero Mel Gibson -- have captured the
imagination of cinema-goers across the globe. And nowhere more so than
south of the Border.
Taywood Homes' Scottish sales and marketing manager Moira Gillespie
reports that the company's show homes have been busier than ever since
the films opened.
''Both have shown the beauty of the hills,'' she says, ''and we have
been stunned by the number of people who, having seen the films, now
want to live in such an environment.
''Because Inverness combines the tranquil beauty and romance of the
Highlands with the convenience of a refined city, more families from
south of the border are seeing the area as the ideal place to settle.''
She adds with a smile: ''I think more than a few of the ladies are
secretly hoping that most Scotsmen are as handsome as Liam Neeson and
Mel Gibson!''
Taywood Homes has three developments in Inverness, and buyers can --
almost literally -- stake their own claim to a slice of Scottish history
at its Hillside site, where three- and four-bedroom houses are only two
miles away from Culloden battlefield.
The company's fine collection of homes have all been snapped up at its
Ferryfield development, North Kessock, where owners enjoy magnificent
views over the picturesque Beauly Firth. But work has just begun on the
second phase of Stratherrick Gardens -- a charming collection of stylish
three- and four-bedroom homes in the idyllic residential area of
Lochardil.
Prices at Hillside range from #82,450 for the Lomond -- a
three-bedroom detached bungalow -- to #103,450 for the four-bedroom
detached Kelburn villa.
At Stratherrick Gardens, prices start at #95,950 for the Abbotsford
four-bedroom detached villa with single garage, and go up to #101,950

''If our experience is anything to go by,'' says Moira Gillespie,
''the Highlands are flourishing on the back of Rob Roy and Braveheart.
Inverness offers all that's good about life in the Highlands and we are
delighted to see so many more people taking it to their hearts.''

The Initiative's first two years have provided evidence of a
partnership which is working for the benefit of all
Michael Forsyth
James Maxwell, director of Stirling Initiative, outlines the case for
the historic town's regeneration and what it will mean to people who
live there and the tourists the Initiative hopes to attract
EVEN those who know Stirling well could scarcely have expected the
transformation that is happening in the town. Nothing has prepared them
for the pace of change, the scale of investment and the revolutionary
zeal with which a partnership of public agencies, led by the Scottish
Office, have tackled the comprehensive revival of Scotland's ancient
capital.
The post-war years had not been kind to Stirling, particularly
compared with Glasgow and Edinburgh where public spending on environment
and the roads system paved the way for a flow of business investment and
general economic growth. Stirling, despite its unique appeal and
enormous potential for tourism, somehow missed out.
Now the nettle has been well and truly grasped by the Stirling
Initiative, a partnership of seven public agencies, led by the Scottish
Office, including Forth Valley Enterprise (the local LEC), both tiers of
local government, Historic Scotland, national and local area tourist
boards and Scottish Homes. The Stirling Initiative's aim is to attract
#100m of capital expenditure to Stirling by the year 2003, nearly half
of which will come through ''pump-priming'' investment by the initiative
partners and the Scottish Office directly.
After only two years in existence, the Initiative has secured more
than #49m in new investment for Stirling and has been warmly praised by
the Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Forsyth, who is also the MP
for Stirling.
It all began in 1991 when the Scottish Office appointed two task
groups, chaired by Forth Valley Enterprise and the Scottish Tourist
Board, to consider how the town's economy could be stimulated and
prepared to meet the challenges of the next century. The big
opportunities were quickly recognised -- the castle as a top-level
visitor attraction, the Old Town as a new focus for tourism, the
redevelopment of underused sites near the station, the rejuvenation of
Stirling's town centre to create a competitive, modern business and
shopping environment.
A 10-year strategy was set out to revitalise Stirling as a place to
live, work and do business. The programme of projects would be driven by
a partnership of seven key public agencies, chaired by the Scottish
Office, and known as the Stirling Initiative.
In July 1993, the seven partners joined with the Scottish Office,
committing themselves to a development programme in which each would
play its part. Not, of course, that every project involves all the
partners -- many involve only one or two. The vital element was mutual
support, with partners agreeing to assist each other where possible in
achieving shared objectives for the town.
These shared objectives are formalised in the initiative's strategic
and operating plans, which also provide the basis for the measurement of
progress against targets.
Managing the partnership process is project director James Maxwell,
himself a product of Stirling University. He co-ordinates the flow of
communication within the partnership, and has the unenviable task of
preparing a single operating plan which also fits with the plans of the
individual partners.
Asked about progress, he said: ''Visitors coming to the town are
always impressed by how much things have changed and how
visitor-friendly Stirling has become.
''Some of the Initiative's biggest projects -- particularly the
environmental improvements -- have been completed and major new visitor
attractions will be open for next season. ''
Stirling is changing before our eyes, and by next summer the town will
be a very different place to look at. But will it have lost any of the
charm which makes it such a popular day out for many Scots?
James Maxwell said: ''Before all the recent improvements Stirling's
visitor appeal was disappearing in a haze of exhaust fumes. The town
centre had really gone into decline and everyone was suffering --
visitors, residents and traders.''
''Now we are reclaiming the town for pedestrians and, as we know from
other towns, that means good news for businesses in the area. There's no
doubt that the town has become a far more attractive place to visit, as
well as to live and work.''

<HEADLINE>Six years' jail for 'stinging' Sting. 'Crummy' financial adviser guilty on eight theft counts</HEADLINE>

SHOWBIZ accountant Keith Moore was jailed for six years yesterday for
stealing #6m from trusting rock superstar Sting.
The 51-year-old financial adviser, whose clients also included Queen
and Scottish pop group Big Country, lost most of it in a series of
high-risk ventures around the world and used the rest to twice stave off
bankruptcy.
Disgraced and now penniless, Moore's only reaction to eight unanimous
guilty verdicts from the jury was an occasional shake of the head.
He stood ramrod straight in the dock at Southwark Crown Court as Judge
Gerald Butler QC told the man who was described even by his own
barrister as a ''crummy accountant'' that he had deceived those who had
faith in him.
''You have been convicted of a series of offences of theft, carried
out in gross breach of trust, of large sums of money which you used to
pay your debts and finance a number of highly speculative ventures of
your own and which came to grief,'' he said.
''I bear in mind your previous good character and that you are now a
ruined man who will never again practise as an accountant.''
The judge, referring to Sting by his real name of Gordon Matthew
Sumner, added: ''It is also right that I should mention that Mr Sumner
has recovered much the greater part of his losses but that is no thanks
to you.''
A custodial sentence was ''of course inevitable'' and the appropriate
punishment was one of concurrent terms of six years' jail on each count.
Moore then picked up a bag containing personal belongings and was led
from the dock by two security officials.
As he went, he mouthed the word ''goodbye'' and blew a kiss to his
distraught girlfriend, Miss Santosh Banger, who stood with lips
trembling in the public gallery at the back of the court.
As he disappeared from her view, what little composure she had finally
crumbled and she collapsed sobbing uncontrollably into the arms of
friends.
The eight sample charges they convicted him of covered withdrawals of
huge sums of money from Sting's personal and business accounts at Coutts
and Company -- the Queen's personal bankers -- and Lloyds between
August, 1988, and July, 1992.
Sting, 44, who on Monday paid a surprise visit to the court with his
pregnant wife Trudie to hear the judge's summing up, was not in court
yesterday.
In a statement issued through his solicitors, Burley &amp; Company, after
the guilty verdict, he said: ''I am pleased it is all over.''
Then, referring to the fact that his bankers, Coutts &amp; Company, had
wrongly allowed #4.8m of his cash to be transferred by Moore, he went
on: ''In the light of statements made during the trial, I wish to say
that Coutts &amp; Company have been my bankers for 15 years and remain my
bankers.
''I am confident in their ability to conduct my banking affairs well.
I have no intention of changing any of my bankers.''
Moore will probably be footnoted in legal legend as the man who was
able to steal #6m because its rock superstar owner was too wealthy to
notice.
He had represented a number of big names in the music industry but
Sting did not know that groups such as Queen and Big Country had lodged
complaints against Moore with the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
In November, 1979, he was struck off after being found guilty by the
institute's disciplinary committee of professional misconduct.
Restored to the register, he was censured three years later for
incompetence and fined #200 with #350 costs over a second accusation of
misconduct in relation to a bounced cheque.
In 1986, Moore was again struck off, this time for incompetence
bringing discredit on the profession. The sentence was substituted for a
reprimand and a fine on appeal.
Moore had refused to hand over Big Country's records and accounts
after the band had challenged his fees, despite a High Court order.
Mr Ian Grant, the group's manager, said: ''It became a complete
nightmare. He tried to take a lot of the financial control out of my
jurisdiction and set up a complicated tax structure with a web of
companies, all of which generated huge fees for himself.
''It got to the point where he wanted to deal with the band and
exclude me. He charged thousands of pounds but we found he was up to
things like billing the band for flights to New York.''
Moore's lottery-sized dishonesty was recounted to the court amid tales
of state-benefits-to-riches, Alice-in-Wonderland investments, and tax
bills so frighteningly large they do not even figure in nightmares.
The hockey-mad financial adviser had spent years secretly siphoning
off vast sums from some of Sting's 100-plus bank accounts. Most of it
was then squandered in a series of risky ventures around the globe.
More than #200,000 went on a plush home in Earl's Court, London,
initially earmarked for Moore's girlfriend. A further #1.3m was
swallowed up in twice saving the accountant from bankruptcy. Sting never
suspected a thing.
Millions more would have probably disappeared but for the timely
arrival of an anonymous tip-off.
The unsigned letter -- which a ''deeply shocked'' and white-faced
Sting read with trembling hands at his luxury home in Malibu, California
-- catalogued the huge thefts from his accounts.
At first, he tried to convince himself it was all a hoax. However, the
revelations, penned, it was later learned, by one of Moore's office
workers and somebody who worked for an insurance company, turned out to
be all too real.
They resulted in a series of confrontations, with Sting, his managers,
and lawyer on one side and Moore on the other. The accountant admitted
everything, making clear he was deeply ashamed.
At some stage during his detailed apologies, he appeared to hint he
had been blackmailed. No details were given and when asked to sign a
confession he refused.
The six-man, six-woman jury heard Moore's blatant breach of trust
succeeded partly because the former Police musician had no option but to
rely heavily on professional advisers to manage an international
business empire of ''mushrooming complexity''.
He said he had no choice but to trust Moore totally.
Never happy with high finance, Sting reduced the court to fits of
laughter as he explained that his incompetence with large figures proved
the death knell of a short-lived career as a taxman.
Crown counsel Neill Stewart said the main reason Moore was able to
deceive for so long was because the actor and singer, who earns millions
every year, was simply too wealthy to notice.
So ignorant was he of how much he was worth that Sting, who went
virtually overnight from anonymous #16-a-week state benefits to fame and
fortune, at first thought he had been ruined.
Until, that is, someone kindly pointed out he still had #14m left at
the time.
Nevertheless Sting -- now thought to be Britain's 251st richest person
with a fortune estimated by Business Age at #70m -- was more than happy
when Coutts paid him back #4.8m of his stolen wealth.
The court heard the blue-blooded bankers wrongly sanctioned a total of
30 transfers from Sting's personal and business accounts, on Moore's
orders, even though he had no mandate to do so.
The jury was told the money was ''shunted'' into a Bank of Scotland
account over which Sting had no control. From there, it quickly found
its way into a company called Gramelda Investment Ltd, which belonged to
the accountant.
In evidence, Moore claimed Sting sanctioned the ''general principles''
behind the investments but never asked for details.
The star, he said, had insisted on anonymity and told him to draw on
millions the accountant had saved him in tax.
The performer said that was nonsense. He had never given his
permission for anything of the sort, preferring to plough his money
instead into his homes -- a #2m mansion in Great Dunford, Wiltshire, a
#1m townhouse in Highgate, north London, bought from Sir Yehudi Menuhin,
an apartment in New York, and the Malibu retreat, once Barbra
Streisand's.
As far as Sting believed, he had been approving funds for his own
revenue demand.
Not only was he ''not so generous'' as to bankroll his accountant's
financial difficulties, news of the man's impending bankruptcy would
have set ''alarm bells ringing very loudly''.
After all, asked the star, if Moore could not manage his own financial
affairs, how could he look after his?
According to the jury -- dishonestly.
