PAUL McPhillips squeezed into the Benson and Hedges championship final
-- but only just -- after a day of close encounters at Edinburgh's JP
Leisure Centre.
McPhillips, from Thornliebank, faces Welshman Matthew Stevens over the
best of 17 frames after both won their semi-finals by 6-5 margins.
While Stevens staged a remarkable recovery against Matthew Couch,
McPhillips had to head off a battling, rear-guard action from outsider
Robert Milkins.
Leading 5-2, it seemed a formality that McPhillips would become the
fourth Scot in six years to reach the final of a tournament that
provides one of two wild cards to the next year's B &amp; H Masters at
Wembley.
At this point, Milkins decided to go for his shots and succeeded in
rattling the world No.64 with breaks of 52, 66, and 49.
That forced a last-frame decider that eventually went McPhillips' way
after 13, agonising minutes for his supporters.
Stevens will start favourite after his big rise up the provisional
rankings this season so far, from 236th to No.57.
He also has beaten McPhillips twice in the last 18 months though the
Scots insists: ''If I play as well as I did in the early part of the
match I should be okay.''

PRODUCER price figures for October encouraged hopes that inflationary
pressures, arising from sterling's fall from grace earlier in the year
and the upsurge in commodity prices, were moderating.
However, the figures were read as a further sign that the authorities
might soon have scope to cut interest rates. This had an adverse effect
on the pound, already under a cloud as the dollar fell again in response
to the mounting political crisis over the US Federal debt ceiling.
Sterling's trade-weighted index lost 0.5 points to 83.3 after dropping
to 83.2 at lunchtime as the pound gave up ground to both the dollar and
the Deutschmark.
The vulnerability of sterling to domestic and international concerns
places a constraint on the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke,
in planning his Budget at the end of the month.
If the pound's latest bout of weakness is not reversed, a second round
of imported inflation could rear its ugly head just when the first seems
to be abating.
Factory gate prices rose by 0.2% last month taking the annual rate of
increase up from 4.5% in September to 4.6%, its highest level since
April 1991.
But the rest of the news from the producer price data was much more
encouraging. In particular, the core measure of factory gate price
inflation, which excludes the food, drink, tobacco and petroleum
industries, has begun to fall.
This measure rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, and the annual rate
dropped from 5% in September to 4.8%. It was the first decline since
June last year, when the rate hit its cyclical low of 2%.
The three-month annualised seasonally adjusted rate is widely
acknowledged as a good guide to the trend in factory gate price
inflation. This rate, which read 5.7% in March, fell from 4.8% in
September to 4% and points to further falls in factory gate inflation.
Input prices, which measure manufacturers' fuel and materials costs,
fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in October after a revised increase
of 0.9% (1.1%) in September. As a result, the annual rate dropped from a
revised 9.2% (9.5%) to 7.8%.
The favourable trend last month largely reflected falls in the prices
of crude oil and imported metals and chemicals. Input price inflation
peaked at 12.1% in January.
Pulp and paper prices, which show one of the strongest year-on-year
rises, increased again in October. Higher prices for home produced food
manufacturing goods added 0.1% to the input price index in October.
Goldman Sachs's David Walton said: ''These numbers point to a clear
easing in inflationary pressure in the manufacturing sector.''
Business surveys indicated a further fall in input and output price
inflation in coming months, he added.
''These trends should help lead to a drop in underlying retail price
inflation from the middle of next year, taking inflation back to the
Government's target of 2.5% in mid-1997.''
James Capel's Adam Cole said he believed the peak in headline annual
output price inflation was not too far away.
''And, while it is not fully clear how much more, if any, of the
previous pick up in pipeline price pressures has yet to come through at
the retail level, the conditions for an easing in monetary policy are
falling into place. One of the last pieces of the jigsaw should be
provided by a relatively tight Budget on November 28.''

THE single-tier Highland Council has agreed a draft scheme on
decentralisation, which will be launched on Saturday at a conference of
the Highland Association of Community Councils.
The scheme, which will then go out for wider consultation, is based on
eight area committees, covering everything from licensing to education.
The eight area structures are based on the Highland District Council
areas: Inverness; Nairn; Badenoch and Strathspey; Ross and Cromarty;
Caithness; Sutherland; Skye and Lochalsh; and Lochaber. They will look
to the Highland Council for overall policy and funding.
Convener Peter Peacock pledged yesterday that the council would have a
full system of decentralisation in place when it opens for business next
April.

KEITH BRUCE watches as a classic is brought up to date
WHEN the run of a new show is extended by a week on the day after it
opens, you can be pretty sure that The Citizens' -- never a house to be
financially rash -- is confident it has a hit on its hands.
But when that play is John Osborne's kitchen-sink classic Look Back In
Anger, and the production is by a first-time director, it is still
reasonable to express a note of surprise. Look Back may be held by
students of drama to be the piece that began a renaissance in British
theatre in 1956, but it is also seen as very much of its time, and its
author -- whose character was roundly assassinated in obituaries
following his death last Christmas -- is generally out of fashion.
There are two obvious reasons why such immediate expectations have
been confounded. Prosaically, the presence of the text on the school
syllabus will obviously have helped. More importantly, this first-time
director is a man of considerable theatrical experience, much of it at
Glasgow's Citz.
Kenny Miller learned his craft as Prowse's protege in the Gorbals and
has been associated with the Citizens' for more than ten years. The move
to directing seems to have been a natural progression, and one that grew
out of self-criticism.
''For a while a lot of my design work was very self-indulgent -- I was
dressing people to cause outrage.''
He's wary of preconceptions ''because it's so fashionable for
designers to be directors'', but is also conscious of the years of being
freelance and working with directors ''with no visual sense''.
''I was always being told by directors: do something Citzy. I came
back to the Citz because everywhere else wanted 'the Citz style',
whatever that is.
''You end up looking a prat because there is no communication from the
directors. The only place that doesn't happen is the Citz. Anywhere else
I would have had to set up my own company to do this.''
What Miller has done is to update Osborne's 50's classic, purged
period references from the text, and used contemporary soundtrack and
costumes. There are anachronistic touches, but the 50s props are kitsch
and fashionable at the moment. He has even (shock, horror) dispensed
with Alison's iconic ironing board.
''It is a good play, full of interesting things, about five people
going through intense and disturbing emotions. Part of the institution
of kitchen-sink drama is that it covered radical issues and they are
still there. It is about non-communication between people and taking
each other for granted. And the class thing is still there -- it stands
up to a modern treatment.''
Most theatregoers remember the film, or may have seen Giles Havergals'
production years ago, or even the 1958 Citizens' staging with Fulton
Mackay as Jimmy Porter, but Miller set out with the aim of making a
production that connected with young adults.
''I wanted them to think: that happened to me, or that happened to my
friend. The preview audience was full of 16 to 18 year olds and they
were riveted by it -- not bouncing about as I thought they would.''
That was only one concern among a whole new set of first night nerves.
''As a designer I was always nervous whether people would break a
heel, or lose an earring, or come on in the wrong cardigan. Now I get
whether they turn the television on and off in the right place, or use
the right ashtray as well.''
Miller had a developed concept of what he wanted when he went into
rehearsals for Look Back and ''on the whole it has turned out that
way''.
''I love working with actors and as a designer you don't get to,
except at fittings. The big surprise was seeing them make the
characterisation. To see the progression of a character being born is
fantastic.''
For Miller, his transition reflects a trend in theatre in general
towards concentration on actors, text, and character instead of
''unnecessary flamboyance''. In his own work he has appreciated the
discipline of being part of a new movement in design that is about
simplicity, shape, and colour.
That change makes demands of writers and he has yet to find anything
among the new plays he has read or seen that have the depth of
characterisation in Look Back. His current -- and persisting -- dream is
to be granted the rights to stage Patrick Suskind's classic novel
Perfume.
More immediately, his concern is Collodi's Pinocchio, and particularly
the problem of making the lad's nose grow every night from November 28
to January 13. The man who has rejected outrage and flamboyance has been
predictably dismissive of the option of a condom and an air-pump.
* Kenny Miller's production of Look Back in Anger runs at the
Citizens' to December 9.

KVAERNER Govan, Britain's largest commercial shipbuilder, has been
marking time in recent months, but improvements in productivity and new
orders are expected to come through soon.
Kvaerner said the the performance of the Clyde shipyard during the
first nine months of 1995 had been ''on a par with the same period last
year''.
But the Norwegian shipping and engineering group said it expected to
see productivity gains by its 1200 employees at Govan during the fourth
quarter and further gains next year.
Kvaerner, meanwhile, reported continuing difficulties in breaking into
the UK offshore engineering sector, where it still operates at a loss.
It owns three offshore engineering companies in Aberdeen and another
in London. These have been trying for two years to carve a niche for
themselves in the UK sector of the North Sea.
But senior vice-president for finance Jan Magne Heggelund said: ''We
have not been able to make money in the UK. It is extremely difficult to
actually work ourselves into the market. We haven't been able to get the
workload that we want so we are not working at full capacity.''
Mr Heggelund said the Govan shipyard, which Kvaerner took over in
1988, was running at breakeven and should make a small profit during
1995 as a whole. But he said Kvaerner's overall UK activities would
remain in the red.
The group has annual turnover of about #270m in the UK, of which Govan
accounts for roughly a third.
New orders for the Glasgow shipyard have been slow to materialise, but
Mr Heggelund said this was mainly due to international constraints on
the world shipbuilding industry.
''People have been anxious to see what will happen with the OECD
agreement to take away direct subsidies from shipyards, although we now
know there are not going to be any changes just now,'' he explained.
He said the weakness of the dollar against European currencies had
also dampened the placing of new orders since most shipbuilding
contracts are in dollars.
He declined to say which contracts Kvaerner was chasing for Govan, but
he revealed most were for specialist ships such as chemicals carriers.
Kvaerner announced in August that Govan had won a #60m order to build
a special transporter ship to carry Russian-built rockets to a floating
launch pad in the Pacific Ocean, but it is still awaiting the green
light on this project.
Mr Heggelund said Govan was performing well by comparison with most
other European shipyards, but a desired improvement in productivity had
not yet materialised.
Kvaerner yesterday contrasted the standstill performance at Govan and
its Rostock yard in east Germany with improved profitability at its
Norwegian and Finnish shipyards during the first nine months of this
year.
Kvaerner's profits from shipbuilding during the period rose from
#93.4m to #100.1m and a good result is expected for the year as a whole.
The group's overall pre-tax profit rose 65% to #195.2m, mainly as a
result of a #57.4m gain from the disposal of its gas carrier fleet.
The oil and gas division moved back into profit, despite a
disappointing performance from its UK operations. But its mechanical
engineering division barely managed to break even, and it took a #20.1m
loss on its pulp and paper operations.

VETERAN hurdler Yacht Clubshould represent excellent value in the Ken
Hodgson Birthday Conditional Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle at Wetherby today.
Les Eyre certainly could not have predicted such an unusual career
pattern for his 13-year-old when he shelled out 15,000 guineas for him
in 1989 on the basis of a couple of Irish point-to-point wins.
The gelding got his act together to score twice in 1991 but he then
entered a period in the wilderness. But he has bounced right back to
form this term.
Yacht Club has twice galloped his rivals into submission in selling
handicaps, the latest being an 11-length defeat of Palace River at
Hexham.
But he also lost no caste in defeat in a non-seller at Carlisle in
September when four lengths second to Master Hyde, the pair 20 lengths
clear.
Raised only 4lb since Hexham, Yacht Club remains nicely treated. And
with jockey Chris Elliott able to claim a full 10lb, he'll have a racing
weight of only 9st 5lb.
It's worth taking Snitton Lane's fitness on trust in the Sebel House
Group Handicap Chase, as he's the class act of the three runners.
Although he lost his way a little towards the end of last season, it's
worth recalling earlier efforts, notably over course and distance in the
Grade Two Castleford Chase last December.
A 25-1 shot that day, Snitton Lane had no answer to easy winner Viking
Flagship but still had Sybillin and Uncle Ernie behind.
The Minister gets the vote in the Knaresborough Novices' Handicap
Chase. Trainer Bob Champion is enjoying a decent run and The Minster
contributed to it with a bloodless success at Huntingdon last month when
beating Sensitive King 20 lengths.

The current state of children's theatre in Britain is no small wonder
to Mark Fisher.
THE low status we give young people's theatre creates problems that
are not just to do with the odd children's company wishing it got more
coverage in the papers. It goes deeper than that.
The more that artistic provision for young people is thought of as a
marginal activity, the less it is likely to attract interest from anyone
working in the mainstream. Whether that person be a playwright, a
director, an actor or a technician, the lure of high-profile,
culturally-credible work will always be more tempting than the obscure.
If, as a result, the most talented people stay away, children's theatre
can only lose out.
And as long as young people's theatre is kept at a distance from the
mainstream, its image of being obscure and second-rate is reinforced.
It's peripheral because it's peripheral because it's peripheral.
The situation in Scotland is looking ever more healthy. As the
pantomime season approaches, it's good to see that Stuart Paterson's
intelligent Christmas shows are out again in force (catch them in
Stirling, Dundee and Edinburgh), proving that it is possible to invest
young people's theatre with the same high standards of writing and
staging that adults take for granted. Communicado will prove the same
with the revival of its excellent Tall Tales for Cold Dark Nights at the
Tron Theatre.
Meanwhile the springtime Edinburgh International Children's Festival
is playing an important role not only in showcasing the small base of
Scottish children's theatre companies but also in demonstrating wider
possibilities through the work of foreign artists.
But the reason those foreign artists can achieve work of greater
stature is not to do with fluke or mysterious genetic advantage. It's
simply to do with more value being placed in young people's work in the
first place. If you value something, you invest in it; if it's invested
in, it acquires a status of its own.
Sometimes you have to kick-start that process. That's certainly what
John Retallack, artistic director of Oxford Stage Company feels. His
company, which he joined in 1989, has three strands to its work:
adaptations taken from unusual sources; Shakespeare and the major
classics; and work for young people. The three elements feed off each
other, both in terms of widening audiences' expectations and in terms of
production values. And if one arm seems to be lagging behind, they
notice.
What Retallack discovered on visiting the Netherlands and Sweden a few
years ago under an arts council bursary, was how advanced playwriting
for young people was compared to what was going on in England. ''I got
familiar with a lot of work that was some of the most exciting theatre
I'd seen,'' he says. ''I wasn't entirely prepared for what I saw, which
was theatre as far removed from folk story as it is possible to get. The
writing was of a very high standard. And the only way we could give
people an idea of what we'd seen was to present something of a
smorgasbord of what was there.''
That smorgasbord consists of three plays, all of which can be seen
this week at the MacRobert Arts Centre at the University of Stirling.
Mirad, a Boy from Bosnia, is a two-parter by Holland's Ad de Bont,
perhaps the first play to examine the personal cost of the war in former
Yugoslavia; Hitler's Childhood is a controversial piece by Sweden's
Niklas Radstrom about the critical choices we make as we grow up; and
Grace by Belgium's Ignace Cornelissen is a comedy of a fairy tale gone
wrong.
''We shouldn't get defensive about what's happened in Europe,'' says
Retallack, who has already started to commission British playwrights in
the hope that they will be inspired by these three plays. ''In Holland
and Sweden, which I'd say are the leaders, there has been an
infrastructure for young people since the war and there are a number of
very accomplished artists who have concentrated on that area of work for
their whole career. It's a movement that is both matured and full of
energy.''
What should be encouraging to British audiences is that the situation
hasn't always been so rosy in the Netherlands, Belgium or Sweden. Before
this century the Netherlands had no children's theatre to speak of and
very little puppetry. There was a move towards professionalism in the
1920s and further advances immediately after the war, but it wasn't
until the 1980s that other theatre practitioners began to see its
potential, and it was as recently as 1991 that plays for children began
to be published.
In Sweden it took a political debate about the rights of children in
the 1960s to give an all-important lift to young people's theatre.
Likewise, in Belgium, it has been a post-war phenomenon, flourishing
particularly in the 1970s.
''I think this project has made a start,'' says Retallack, pointing
out that the next London International Festival of Theatre is planning
to bring over some more examples from Europe. ''I stand by the work.
We've had a great response from audiences even to the degree of teachers
objecting then the class drowning them out. The feel in the camp is very
much that we must do it again.''
* Making the Future, three new European plays, is running all week at
the MacRobert Arts Centre, Stirling.

AS any accountant will tell you, customers are the source of all
positive cash flow. Hardly suprising, then, that one of the management
mantras of the nineties has been the chant customer orientation.
The American writer Paul Levesque puts this in perspective. ''Most
workers are task focused, most managers are profit focused; who's left
to be customer focused?''
How many organisations have built the supply chain capabilities to
make this incantation meaningful . . . how
many have achieved the necessary commitment levels from their
employees to make the objective of customer focus a reality?
Customers are now so sophisticated that merely meeting their
expectations is not sufficient since that's what the competition do. One
of the late Sam Walton's basic rules used to build the Wal-Mart empire
was ''exceed your customer expectations''.
Today's reviewer works at the cutting edge of Scotland's export drive
dealing with customers worldwide. Chris Packard (pictured above) is
director of customer services at John Brown Engineering.
A BRIEF history of Scottish resourcefulness can be found on a
best-selling tourist souvenir. The Irish linen tea towel tells us of
famous historical inventions from Mackintosh's raincoat to James Watt's
steam engine and John Logie Baird's television to name just three.
Scots gave those innovations to the world. Are we still competing on a
global basis? Scotland's current export performance offers some
interesting insights. There has been a dramatic increase in export
achievement with computers well out in front and approaching 25% of our
total exports.
Whether this is through inventiveness or a result of an excellent
business perspective matters little. Today we are doing better than we
are given credit for.
But what about tomorrow? With a market place that changes with
increasing rapidity, how much effort are we putting in today to ensure
tomorrow's success?
In his book Managing for the Future*, Alf Chattel details the
essential concepts of tomorrow's successful organisation. He moves many
of yesterday's paradigms to those of tomorrow, for combative to
collaborative, rigid to dymanic, hierarchal to empowered, and crucially
from service as an adjunct to service is the business.
All of these clearly focus on ''The Customer'' whom the author sees
occupying centre stage in the thinking of organisations of the future
and it matters not whether your business is making television sets,
computers or, as in the case of my own company, building multimillion
pound power stations.
Tomorrow's sales people will not be emphasising the product since it
will either meet the quality standard or it won't. The issues will be
very different, concentrating on through-life support, comprehending and
responding to customers' requirements, and even more importantly, having
the organisational structure and ethos that can react to their needs. As
Alf Chattell puts it, each company will have to reshape itself in order
to deliver distinctive responses to individual needs.
In my experience however, customer needs can be difficult to define.
Many businesses make the mistake of trying to tell their customers what
they want. Success is founded on the ability to listen. When we carried
out a worldwide customer survey, we were surprised at the answers.
As a result of the survey findings we changed our service organisation
at John Brown Engineering in a most radical way. At the front of the
organisation are now six business units who are collectively empowered
with total responsibility for all our customers at all times across the
world. (We do not have a sales department anymore, everyone is a
customer-focused person). These business units are supported by
specialist teams who see them as their customers. The next customer
survey will no doubt tell us how well it works but what we have done so
far appears to coincide with the views set out by the author.
Having struck such an accord so early in the book, I looked forward to
finding a route map or even a few clues as to the next steps we should
be taking in our continuous improvement programme. I was less than happy
with the author's view of how he sees the business world being shaped.
I am left wondering if the author has worked with real people. In
today's world, employees already suffer lack of security, are
apprehensive about the unknown and are sceptical about management
intentions. They need the comfort and security that our short-term
outlook junked many years ago before we can even remotely ask them to
join in moving towards this vision of even greater uncertainty.
Moreover, Chattell's faith in information technology as a means of
getting close to the customer is naive. Reading about instantaneous
feedback, redesign and continuous streams of open information that
enable immediate responses to meet customer requirements, would
encourage one to believe that this is a reality just around the corner.
Indeed, the IT hype market has told us this for some time. While the
pace of change is amazing, this IT world exists today largely in the
minds of the advertiser, the gullible and the dreamer.
I am left wondering whether the author sees himself as the Aldous
Huxley of the Brave New Business World where highly-structured
electronic intelligences require compatible human minds trained in
disciplined channels of thought. Woe betide us if the Customer/Supplier
relationship should be dehumanised to such a level.
Any book which asserts the primacy of the customer is worth reading.
But from an author with 15 years' experience in blue-chip consultancy
who will have seen his fair share of successes and failures I wanted
more. Like Mark Twain's river boat pilot I expected him to know where
the rocks are so that we can navigate the future.

TWO elderly men with links to the Kray and Richardson gangs were
jailed yesterday for 18 and 15 years respectively.
The Old Bailey heard that Anthony Keegan, 61, had deliberately shot
Security Express guard, Mr Andrew Wallis, 44, in the leg during a
#10,000 robbery at Iceland food store in Bermondsey, east London.
Keegan was captured by Special Branch officers who rammed a getaway
car driven by Christopher Bulbrook, 60.
Mr Wallis, who still suffers pain from the injury, had offered no
resistance.
When he was shot, eyewitness Mrs Alice Whitlock, 78, was so disgusted
with Keegan's actions that she hit him with her handbag, Mr John Kelsey
Fry, prosecuting, told the court.
Recorder of London Sir Lawrence Verney said the pair would be starting
long prison sentences at an age when most people would be retiring.

David Greig considers why Scotland, with its rich literary tradition,
should seem intent on making life hard for its talented playwrights
AS a playwright working in Scotland it's hard to avoid the impression
that real Scottish writers don't write plays. The talented writers, the
writers with big ideas, are novelists, or poets. Of all the new
theatrical productions over the past two years, more than 30 were
adaptations from novels.
TAG's adaptation of Lanark, the Citizens' Trainspotting, and The
Tron's production of The Trick Is To Keep Breathing have been critical
and commercial successes. Scottish novels, and Scottish novelists, are
big business in the box office. Recently, in this newspaper, Mark Fisher
asked whether Scottish playwrights were not, perhaps, partly to blame
for their increasing marginalisation. Is it possible that playwrights
simply don't have the same imaginative depth and breadth of their prose
counterparts?
It wouldn't be surprising if contemporary Scottish playwriting was
second-rate. In the league tables of writing, Scottish playwrights have
tended to be stuck in the Ayrshire Juniors while the English and the
Irish battled it out in Serie A. Traditionally, we are not a
theatre-producing nation, and certainly we have very little tradition of
playwriting. The question is why?
In 1756, John Hume premiered his play Douglas at the Theatre Royal in
Edinburgh and it played to packed houses. A member of the opening-night
audience is said to have stood at the end of the performance and shouted
''Whaur's yer Wullie Shakespeare noo?'' John Hume was a minister at the
time and his dabbling in theatre cost him his job because the Kirk
didn't approve. His experience was not untypical. In fact, just as
Virginia Woolf once wondered what would have happened if Shakespeare had
had a sister, Judith, it's interesting to ponder what would have
happened if he had also had a talented Scottish cousin, Oor Wullie, if
you like.
If Oor Wullie had been writing drama at any time between the
Reformation and the late eighteenth century, the likelihood is that the
church would have come down hard on him. If he'd turned his hand to
prose or poetry, however, he'd probably have been left alone. Of course,
he'd probably have wanted to see his work on stage. This would also have
been difficult. Since the court had moved to London (where James
Sixth/First was one of Shakespeare's patrons) there was no centre for
patronage in Scotland. Without patronage it's extremely difficult for
theatre to exist and so the growth of a theatre infrastructure in
Scotland was severely stunted.
By the time the influence of the church had waned, a vicious circle
had developed whereby Scotland had no real theatre tradition but a very
strong tradition in prose and poetry. If Oor Wullie was anything like
most writers he would have imagined himself heir to the great names of
the past, which in his case would be Scott or Burns. There would have
been very little theatre for him to see and what was available would
most likely be poor imitations of the London West End.
Oor Wullie would have stood a slightly better chance in the early
twentieth century. By now, there were a number of producing companies
working north of the Border. But even in the 1920s Hugh McDiarmid was
complaining about the lack of a ''Scottish theatre craft''.
It was said that ''the Scot thinks a lot but says little'', which
hardly bodes well for Oor Wullie's attempts at writing dialogue.
His writing would also have had other pressures brought to bear upon
it. The more nationalist theatre companies would have required him to
use his playwriting as a vehicle for Scots language. The nascent
left-wing ''peoples'' companies would have wanted him to write to a
revolutionary agenda. At a time when all over Europe writers were
discovering Dada, or surrealism, Oor Wullie would have been caught up in
his own narrow, provincial, semi-professional theatre of the absurd.
In fact, it's not until the founding of the Arts Council and the
establishment of the BBC in Queen Margaret Drive that a healthy theatre
infrastructure begins to form in Scotland. Professional actors are able
to find work, the work is initiated and staged in the new theatres --
The Traverse, The Tron, The Citz, The Lyceum, and last, but perhaps most
important, Oor Wullie gets paid for his work.
Bearing this history in mind, it might not be surprising if
contemporary Scottish playwriting was second-rate but it would also not
be true. Despite the difficulties, the past two decades or so have seen
a flowering of Scottish plays that rivals in scale and quality anything
else in the so-called Scottish Renaissance.
As well as Oor Wullie we now have, among others, Tom McGrath, Ian
Heggie, Chris Hannan, John Clifford, Liz Lochhead, Sue Glover, John
Byrne, and Rona Munro who built up a body of Scottish work that
constitutes almost the invention of a tradition. The problem is that
nobody else seems to have noticed.
For example, the Scottish Arts Council still makes an irrational
distinction between ''writers'' and ''dramatists''. While ''writers''
are eligible for bursaries, writers-in-residence positions and subsidies
to visit schools, prisons, and community centres, ''dramatists'' are
not. Dramatists are not listed in the SAC's register of ''Writers In
Schools''; this is despite the fact that the new Higher curriculum
allows pupils to write drama as part of their course.
However, the worst example of Scotland's ignorance of the range and
talent of its playwrights comes from the world of theatre itself. The
trend for adaptations is merely one among a number of symptoms of a
deeper disease. The Scottish theatre doesn't trust its playwrights.
A few years ago the National Theatre commissioned David Hare to write
his ''state of the nation'' trilogy. An epic series of plays covering
the judiciary, the Labour Party, and the clergy. Which Scottish theatre,
national or otherwise, has shown similar boldness with regard to our own
senior writers? How often does a successful Scottish play receive a
second production? What's happened to all the great plays of the
eighties? While The Royal Court revives its successes in a season in the
West End, Scottish revivals are sporadic at best. Where Tom Stoppard is
produced on the West End, we reserve our commercial theatre for The
Rangers Story and, well, Tom Stoppard.
It's not the adaptations themselves that are the problem. Adaptations
are a valid and exciting theatrical form. What's irksome is the sense
that while adaptations get casts of 16 and the main stage, the new plays
are kept for the studio. Offer Chris Hannan a main stage and a cast in
double figures and see if he doesn't demonstrate a breadth of
imagination worthy of any of the major recent novels.
The worry is that unless there is a shift back towards the playwright,
more and more of our senior writers will find their imaginations given
space in film and television from where it is often difficult to return
to a small, subsidised space.
Theatre has always been marginal within Scottish high culture.
However, the eighties and nineties have seen an incredible,
outward-looking and vibrant body of work produced: not just by
playwrights but by directors, devisers, producing houses and touring
companies. There is no need for Scottish theatre to see itself merely as
a receiving house for its big brother literary forms. The great national
debates can and do take place on the stage. New plays are seen as risky
drains on resources but Bondagers, Dumbstruck, and The Salt Wound have
recently shown that the new can be a banker as well.
The only way to create hits, to discover classics, and to build on a
nascent tradition is for Scottish theatre to be bold enough to trust its
own resources. Otherwise it will remain a marginal form and Oor Wullie
will go back to writing something else instead.
A vicious circle had developed whereby Scotland had no real theatre
tradition

DAVID Sole faces a charge of bringing the game into disrepute after
his weekend comments when he criticised referee Colin Henderson for his
handling of Edinburgh Academicals' game against Melrose.
Sole, who coaches the forwards at Raeburn Place, was upset after nine
penalties were awarded against Accies, leading to a winning try by the
Borderers. The defeat places Academicals in severe relegation danger.
Sole was reporting as saying: ''I am absolutely livid. It was
tantamount to cheating. If I were still playing I would have hung up my
boots after that. It was the worst refereeing performance I have ever
seen.''
Yesterday, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said that he had written to
Edinburgh Academicals seeking an explanation for Sole's remarks.
''His reported comments are totally unacceptable,'' said Hogg.
''Unfortunately, it is not the first time that comments have been made
about a referee but, if reported correctly, they are unacceptable.''
Hogg said that once the matter had been investigated then it would be
a matter for the SRU committee to decide what action to take. ''Any
action that may be taken would come under the heading of bringing the
game into disrepute,'' he added.
''You say things like that in the heat of battle,'' said Sole
yesterday. ''Having had time to reflect, and looking at things
logically, I still feel that we were cheated of victory. If the SRU want
to call me in to discuss the matter I'd be happy to do so.''

PAUL Gascoigne's conduct in the match against Aberdeen on Saturday is
likely to be highlighted in a supervisor's report, which could arrive at
Park Gardens today, and the midfield player, who is currently on the
other side of the Border preparing for England's friendly match against
Switzerland at Wembley tomorrow night, should budget for the worst.
The SFA have had enough of angry, snarling footballers who continually
trample the laws of the game into the turf. More significantly they have
grown weary of attempting to defend their sport to the Procurator
Fiscal.
The law obviously believes football to be incapable of policing
itself, and again the police are looking at the behaviour of one or more
footballers.
If it transpires the fiscal is particularly concerned about Gascoigne,
then it would make a mockery of any claim that Scottish referees are
among the best in the world.
He was not cautioned for anything he did on Saturday and neither was
Duncan Ferguson when he head-butted John McStay during a match. Yet,
Ferguson was called to account by the law.
If anything, it is becoming apparent some referees are not doing their
jobs. In fact, they are opting out.
There is a belief that if referees punished behaviour which was
obviously over the top, then fiscals and police would remain on the
outside. However, some fiscals clearly feel they have an obligation to
step in when it seems someone who might have a case to answer is being
allowed to walk away, and that opens up other arguments.
For instance, is it right that footballers stand to be investigated
depending on which town they were in when they committed an alleged
violent act?
It is the case that one city's fiscal will want to take action while
the fiscal in another part of the country wouldn't bother, and that
inconsistency can have more serious consequences than the different
applications of referees.
Also, it is the very inconsistency of referees which make it necessary
for some fiscals to act, while within their own realms, they themselves
are not uniform in the application of their jobs.
The failures of John Rowbotham during last Saturday's match at Ibrox
also re-opened the argument that television evidence be accepted by the
SFA. However, they continue to take their members' view -- the members
are the clubs themselves, so it is they who don't want video evidence --
that television film should not be used on the basis that all sorts of
video tapes from amateur film makers might flood in, and also because it
is not every match which is televised.
It would be easy to lose sight of the crucial truth in all of this
which is that the reason footballers are called to account is because
they cannot, or will not, stop using violent methods.
SFA chief executive Jim Farry said yesterday that everyone, including
club chairmen, will have to take positive action. If they don't, the SFA
will.
''What are the players' union or the managers and coaches association
saying about what is being witnessed on football pitches?'' Farry asks.
''Nothing. The SFA has been the only consistent voice and we are saying
to players, managers, and chairmen their time has come.''
Farry was scathing about some referees, and made it clear the
officials who opt out of taking appropriate action will be called to
account swiftly and punished severely.
Rowbotham, one of the country's best referees, allowed Gascoigne's
fits of temper to pass without so much as a yellow card being shown
when, on at least one occasion, the player should have been dismissed.
Rowbotham also missed a couple of incidents involving other players
and the official will be hearing some harsh words from above.
There may be a tendency among referees, who, to be fair to them, have
been bombarded with changes in recent times, to feel the presence of a
supervisor in the stand offers them an out,believing the supervisor will
deal with a problem in his report.
Footballers must all be treated the same when it comes to punishment
handed down either by the SFA or the Crown. The status or wealth of an
individual must never be considered and in this respect referees must be
bolder.
''I think there is a danger the elasticity of what constitutes decent
behaviour is being stretched by players on the field of play and it
would appear their actions are being condoned partly by the independent
aribiters appointed by the governing bodies,'' Farry said.
''This will necessitate a rethink on the part of referees and
players,'' Farry added. ''We entrust a great part of the ethos of the
game to the men in the middle.
Referees must get it right otherwise they will find themselves off the
list.''
There is no doubt the SFA are concerned that control of the game may
be slipping away from football people and Farry is anxious that everyone
inside the game plays a full part in making sure there are no incidents
which would prompt legal involvement.
''I sometimes wonder if all chairmen are aware of their
responsibilities in this respect,'' he said. ''They bleat about
responsibilities to others, but they have responsibilities to make sure
their players behave with dignity.
''When trouble flares they can go off and hide in corners for a while,
but they have to become more enlightened.''

TERRY Venables has sprung to the defence of Paul Gascoigne. The
calamity-prone World Cup star -- now doubtful for tomorrow's friendly
against Switzerland after a training accident -- does not deny that he
''gave it out'' at Ibrox. But the 28-year-old insists he was provoked by
being spat at and punched.
However, he already has apologised to England coach Venables for the
latest unsavoury publicity. ''He explained what happened. He's prepared
to apologise for it and try to put it behind him,'' said Venables.
''He's a target wherever he is, people stoke him up a bit, and he's got
to handle it.''
Venables believes the former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio player is
a victim of a basic misunderstanding about his style. ''He's always
played with his elbows out, it's part of his screening, and lots of
players do that very well,'' he said.
But this larger-than-life character seems to go over the top in almost
everything he does, and even Gascoigne admits that he is so desperate to
regain his peak after two career-threatening injuries that he is in
danger of burning himself out.''I am overdoing it. I was shattered on
Saturday. I'm trying to do too much, trying to prove something to myself
at the moment that I cannot do. At the moment I'm not using my head.''

SCOTLAND skipper Gary McAllister, set to lead his country into the
European Championship finals, took time off from preparing for the
meaningless clash with San Marino at Hampden tomorrow evening to look
towards next summer, and the challenges which he and the other players
will be asked to face there.
McAllister was adamant that the one nation he wanted to face in the
finals was the host country, England.
''I have always felt a sense of loss that the annual game against the
English has gone,'' he said. ''I have never had the opportunity of
playing against England and would like that.
''I don't care at what stage we meet them, all I know is that I would
like the chance to take them on and the chance can be there for us in
the finals. I know that the matches were stopped because of crowd
trouble, but I don't believe that there will be any bother now. There is
always a heavy police presence at any major game in England, and the
crowd problems have not been as serious in recent years.
''We have been able to do well in the group games and if you look at
the two results against Russia then you can guage just how we have been
progressing.''
McAllister is not ready to claim that the present Scottish side is
able to win a major tournament, such as the one they will compete for in
the summer, but he has a genuine, deep-seated belief that the Scottish
squad can affect the eventual outcome of the next summer's finals.
''We will worry some of the sides who are fancied,'' he says. ''But,
most of all, as well as playing against England, I would love to be the
Scottish captain who can take the team into the second phase of one of
these major tournaments.
''It has never happened and I would like to see it happen next summer.
And it can.''
McAllister also feels that, while the squad has been grinding out
results which matter and attracting negative criticism as they have done
so, there still may not be a case for more entertaining football when
they arrive in England.
''We would like to give the fans a special ''thank you'' at Hampden
this week for the backing we have had throughout the campaign,'' he
said.
''That would be good, but in England we may have to grind out results
just as we have done all the way through since we started this
qualification more than a year ago.''
McAllister still believes that Scotland can still hand the world a new
star if Duncan Ferguson can rehabilitate himself in time for the finals.
''You always have big stars thrown up from a competition such as this,
and you can expect someone from Italy or Croatia to appear from these
finals next summer.
''But I do think that if big Duncan can get back playing for Everton
and get back into this Scotland team, we will have a star to unleash on
the world stage. I believe he is that good.''
Another who could be ''that good'' is Nottingham Forest's Scot
Gemmill, who will win his fourth international ''cap'' tomorrow night.
Scotland manager Craig Brown realises that some of his current
midfield players are approaching the veteran stage and that, soon, he
must address the problem of replacements.
Gemmill tops the list. ''He has the same steely determination as his
father, Archie, and he is a player, a young player, who has always had
the respect of the senior pros in the squad,'' said Brown.
''We know that we will soon have to look at the area of the team which
has been our strongest, but I hope that the players we have at present
will be around for a couple of years.
''It's then that we will look for someone like Scot coming through. He
has impressed us and he will have the chance to do it again in this
game.
''He had a dip in form last season but now he has come back to the
standards which brought him into the squad when he was still a
youngster. Remember, we took him to the last European Championship
finals and to the tour of the USA and Canada prior to that to allow him
the chance to feel a part of the squad.
''I think he has benefitted from that and we have no fears about
bringing him into the team.''
As for the player himself, he admits: ''I have had the benefit of
being along with the top players before but I have never had the honour
of playing alongside Gary McAllister or John Collins, and they are
superb players.
''On a personal level I would like to score a hat trick and for
Scotland to win 6-0, and then the manager would see what I was all
about.''
Rangers' Stuart McCall will drop out of the midfield reckoning after
having failed to reach the standard of fitness Brown requires for this
game, but Gemmill is there and Blackburn Rovers' latest signing from
Scotland, Billy McKinlay, and the Scots' manager is in the mood to throw
everything into attack.
''We may start off in our usual formation,'' said Brown, ''but it's
likely that we will just throw people forward. We want to give the
supporters some entertainment. And we can do that. Remember, the
pressure is now off for the players.''
Striker John McGinlay still waits to hear from his club, Bolton,
whether they will listen to a transfer bid from Celtic. While Bolton
joint manager Roy McFarland said yesterday that Celtic had approached
his club, I understand that the Parkhead side spoke to Bolton at the
weekend.
They want McGinlay. McGinlay wants to go to Celtic. It is all left
with Bolton.

BASKETBALL
BOROUGHMUIR have appealed against the result of the match against
Bruins at the Clydebank Playdrome last Saturday on the grounds that they
were not properly informed of a change of tip-off time.
The start of the game was brought forward an hour and only part of the
Edinburgh team had arrived at the new time of 6.20pm. But the match
officials and the Scottish Basketball Association were aware of the
change which made the situation all the more embarrassing for
Boroughmuir secretary Bill McInnes, who is also SBA president.
The game went ahead and Bruins recorded their first league victory of
the season 69-61, a result which was perhaps put in perspective the
following day when they were knocked out of the Scottish Cup 80-59 by
Dunfermline who do not compete in the senior national league.
The Fife team comprised the Dunfermline under-23 side, who currently
lead the East section of that national league with an unbeaten record,
plus player-coach Neil Thomson.
Dunfermline were one of the clubs who favoured reintroducing a
national senior second division this season to encourage development in
centres such as their own, Troon, and Inverness.

THE race for the Superbowl was thrown wide open at the weekend as the
San Franciso 49ers pulled off a 38-20 upset win over Dallas Cowboys at
Texas Stadium.
The 49ers, without injured quarterback Steve Young, raced to a
24-point lead in the opening 16 minutes, posting Cowboys a reminder of
last season's NFC Championship game which the Texans lost after a
similar first-quarter barrage.
Top receiver Jerry Rice had the last laugh on former 49er cornerback
Deion Sanders, who switched to Dallas in an $35m deal at the start of
the NFL season. Rice caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from replacement
quarterback Elvis Grbac on the second play of the game.
Sanders said: ''I'll put it straight -- they kicked our butts and
proved they don't have to have Steve Young to beat us. My hat's off to
Jerry Rice. He proved why he is probably the best receiver to ever play
the game.''
The victory served as a turnabout in the 49ers' fortunes. They had
suffered two home defeats in the last two weeks.
The St Louis Rams moved into their $185m Trans World Dome and
christened it in fine style with a 28-17 win over NFC West adversaries
Carolina Panthers.

KATHERINE Morrison, who, along with London's Frank Warren, promoted
the ill-fated British bantamweight title fight between Drew Docherty and
Jim Murray at Glasgow's Hospitality Inn last month, is to carry on in
boxing, writes Jim Reynolds.
Morrison said yesterday she will go ahead with a promotion at the Moat
House Hotel in Glasgow on December 17. Proceeds will go towards buying
Christmas gifts for needy children in the city's east end. She and
Warren are also to promote a benefit show for Murray, who died two days
after the fight, early in the new year.
Morrison said: ''After what has been a very difficult time, we have
decided to carry on.''
Future shows will be strictly wine and dine. There will be no tickets
for boxing only.
There will be no return to the Hospitality Inn. Morrison said: ''I
don't think I could handle going back there and I don't know how the
customers would react. It's a pity, because we had some great nights at
that venue.''
Jim Murray's father, Kenny, has said he will be attending the show on
December 17.

HE WILL not thank me for highlighting the difference between his
record in the past year and that of England manager Terry Venables
because, like all football folk, Craig Brown does not encourage tempting
fate as another game approaches.
However, the fact is that, if and when his team beat San Marino this
week, Brown will have fulfilled a prophecy which few of his peers would
have dared utter, even in guarded terms, and at the same time have
completed 12 months that have unquestionably emphasised his right to
lead the national side.
By Wednesday night, Brown will have taken Scotland through five
successive victories in their European Championship qualifying section,
a run that he suggested would be possible and, indeed, would be done to
take Scotland into the finals in England next year. It is a rare
achievement for any national team to string together five wins in a row,
but to do it in a competitive situation is especially laudable.
In contrast, England, who are fancied by many to win the European
title in their own land next summer, have been anything but impressive
since Venables took over. In fact, they have managed only one success in
the last 12 months, and that was against Japan, which compares poorly
with Brown's peformance in that period.
In all matches, friendlies included, since November 16, 1994, when
they drew with Russia, the Scots have won five, drawn three and lost
two, but only one defeat, against Greece, was in serious competition.
For a team that has been regarded by most observers and supporters as of
dubious quality, that is not too bad a show and compares favourably with
many attempts over the years to convince the world that Scotland has to
be treated seriously.
England can argue, of course, that all of their exercises have been
designed to get them ready for the real thing and that results do not
matter en route to the main event. But when you recall the kind of
criticism that his predecessors endured, Venables' performance has been
given a relatively patient ride.
That may be a clear illustration of the esteem with which he is held
by his peers and it is also the case that his real worth will not be
decided until the finals next June. At the same time, it is difficult to
believe that Brown would have survived such a year north of the Border
where, despite the protestations of the establishment, the criticisms of
those in the seats of authority are not generally as excessive or
vitriolic as in the south.
In fact, it seems likely that, if Brown had failed to take the team
into the finals, he would not have been able to soldier on under the
weight of anger which would have been hurled at his door in Park
Gardens.
It is, therefore, only right that he should be pleased with himself
after a year during which his own job was unquestionably on the line.
Oddly enough, Brown is so well adjusted that he probably would have
accepted his fate with equanimity, made his point, and got on with the
next phase in his career.
Like all managers, he knows he will have to go sometime. For now he
deserves congratulations. That is an even rarer event than five wins in
a row.
* THIS has been on of the best years of all time for Scottish golf,
due mainly to the brilliance of our two top players, Colin Montgomerie
and Sam Torrance, but also to some fine stuff from Andrew Coltart, not
to mention the genial big amateur, Gordon Sherry, and his cohort,
Stephen Gallacher. Monty's achievement in pipping Sam to become the No.1
in Europe for the third successive time is immense but so, too, was the
performance of Torrance after 25 years on the Tour. Coltart, Sherry and
Gallacher offer exciting potential for the future, but for all of these
players it might be a good idea to have a long idle idyll over the
winter.
In the top two men's case, for a start, there seems to me a serious
danger of overplaying themselves and suffering the consequences next
year, and the anmateurs will have to be careful not to risk burn-out
before they have made their way into the professional mainstream.
A rest, as they say, is as good as a birdie in hand. Or something
along those lines.

GARY Newbon, the boxing coordinator for ITV, yesterday insisted that
neither Glasgow, nor its fight fans, will be on trial when Irvine's Paul
Weir defends his WBO light-flyweight title against South Africa's Baby
Jake Matlala at the Kelvin Hall on Saturday night.
ITV will beam to millions the world title fight -- the first major
promotion in Glasgow since the tragic events of last month when fans
rioted at a city venue after a British bantamweight championship fight
between Drew Docherty and Jim Murray, who died two days later in
hospital.
Newbon, who is highly regarded in boxing circles, said: ''It is
nonsense to suggest Glasgow is on trial. What happened last month was
tragic for many reasons and, personally, I think the trouble was caused
by alcohol. It was an isolated incident.
''There was no hesitation in ITV minds about being involved with this
promotion. We like coming to Glasgow and have been involved lots of
times with promoter Tommy Gilmour, featuring boxers such as Nigel Benn
and Chris Eubank. The crowds here are knowledgeable and passionate. We
have never experienced any problems.''
Gilmour is also confident the promotion will go smoothly. ''With less
than 300 tickets left, it looks like being a sellout,'' he said.
There were smiles all round when Weir and Matlala came face-to-face in
the magnificent Scotstoun Leisure Centre yesterday. There was no stupid
hype, nor was there animosity. Weir, the only Scot to have won world
titles at different weights, looked calm and confident, while Matlala,
the smallest professional fighter in the world and former flyweight
champion, wore a huge grin.
The South African, who won the flyweight crown by stopping Croy's Pat
Clinton in Glasgow only to lose it to Alberto Jimine, of Mexico, last
October, said: ''I have seen Paul in action a few times. He is a good
boy, a fine boxer, but I am even better.''
Weir said: ''This is a voluntary defence for me. If I didn't think I
could beat Jake I would have taken an easier route.''
The two main supporting bouts feature Tranent's Willie Quinn and
Glasgow's Gary Jacobs. Quinn defends his WBO Continental middleweight
title against Peter Waudby, of Hull, who has just won the Central Area
championship. Jacobs, who recently lost in a world welterweight
championship battle against America's Pernell Whitaker, meets Benji
Marque, of Denver, over 10 rounds. Like Jacobs, Marquez has also lost on
points to Whitaker. Rest of the undercard:
Cruiserweight -- Colin Brown (Glasgow) v David Flowers (Canning Town).
Welter -- Joe Townsley (Cleland) v Kevin Toomey (Hull). Light welter --
Mark Breslin (Barrhead) v Scott Walker (Shaw). Super feather -- Hugh
Collins (Stirling) v JT Kelly (West Hartlepool). Feather -- Lehlohonolo
Ledwaba (South Africa) v Peter Buckley (Birmingham).
* FRANK Bruno's March 16 WBC heavyweight title date against Mike Tyson
was confirmed yesterday for the MGM Grand in Las Vegas -- and Bruno's
promoter predicted he will beat iron Mike.
After fending off the legal blows from Lennox Lewis and his handlers,
Bruno is now free for his mega-money return against Tyson, which was
sanctioned last week by the World Boxing Council.
Warren said: ''Everyone talks about who is the best heavyweight. There
is Lennox Lewis, Riddick Bowe and, of course, Tyson. But one thing they
have all got in common is they have all been on the floor, knocked down
or knocked out.
''One thing for sure is that Frank Bruno is probably the hardest
puncher of all of them, no doubt about it. I honestly believe he will
beat Tyson.''
The roles will be reversed with Bruno champion and Tyson challenger.
In February, 1989, Tyson, as undisputed title-holder, stopped Bruno in
five rounds in Las Vegas.

IF THERE have been few silver linings on the foreign front this
season, at least the next generation of Scottish players have declared
their potential by sailing through their section of the Under-21
European Championship in impressive style. Apart from a defeat in their
opening match against Finland, it has been an exciting time for the
young team who are virtually certain to qualify for the quarter-finals
in the spring.
Perhaps more important, as they go for a new Under-21 record against
San Marino at Firhill tonight, chasing their seventh successive victory,
is the fact that the way they have been playing has encouraged their own
little fan club to gather members.
The quality of play from this side has improved with each outing as
they get more accustomed to each other, despite the fact that their
coach, Tommy Craig, has not fielded the same 11 twice. The chances are
that, if you turn up in Maryhill tonight, you will enjoy what you see,
although the onus will be on the Scots to make it a game. Craig
acknowledges that, but still believes his team will be able to provide
the quality and the result that will please the supporters who have been
growing in number as the section progressed.
San Marino, perhaps understandably, work on the basis that a draw is
time for a lap of honour, even at home. As Scotland's captain, Stephen
Pressley, recalled, the team from the country that occupies a wee bit of
Italy carried on with their ultra-defensive style even after he had put
the Scots in front in the away match. ''They didn't change a bit,'' said
the Dundee United man, ''and there is no chance they will be any
different tomorrow. We will have to be patient but we are confident we
can get the record and go quite far in this competition.''
Pressley earns his twenty-fourth cap at this level which would be a
record itself but for the collection of his Tannadice colleague,
Christian Dailly, who chalks up No.30. They provide a solid, experienced
foundation at the heart of the defence but may not be tested too
severely tonight. Instead, their height may be useful at set-pieces
against a packed defence.
That is one reason why Craig has selected Jim Hamilton of Dundee, to
add his 6ft to the front line. ''We will still play the style we have
become known for, the passing game, but against a tight defence it can
be an advantage to throw in the odd high ball and that is where
Hamilton's height could be an asset.''
Craig has been forced to make some changes over the months but has
also stuck by his own plan to choose the right team for the right
occasion. This time he introduces another new cap in defender Paul
Sheerin, the former Alloa player who is now with Southampton, but
otherwise the side has a relatively experienced look about it.
The Scots could qualify for the last eight before they kick off -- if
Russia have beaten Finland in the afternoon -- but Craig insists they
will not be paying any attention to that scenario. ''Whatever happens,
we will still go out to give it our best, trying to entertain the
customers as this side has done all along. We have not lost a goal in
our last three games and we would like to make this the fourth, as well
as score ourselves. ''
All being well, they will be waiting enthusiastically on Thursday to
hear their opponents in the quarter-finals. Scottish team:
Stillie (Aberdeen), Sheerin (Southampton), Murray (Rangers), Pressley
(Dundee United), Handyside (Grimsby), Donnelly (Celtic), Hamilton
(Dundee), Liddell (Barnsley), Dailly (Dunde United), McCann (Dundee).
* THE SFA last night absolved highland clubs of any blame for crowd
violence which marred Saturday's Qualifying Cup final. One Highland club
official, who did not wish to be named, claimed embarrassed SFA
officials had been forced to admit their own security recommendations
had failed.
Rival supporters battled on the terraces at Christie Park during
Fraserburgh's 4-3 extra-time win against Keith.
Seven arrests and 12 ejections from the ground came during disgraceful
scenes which began in 11 minutes and continued well into the second
half.

SCOTLAND caps Stewart Campbell and John Manson have pulled out of the
North and Midlands side which takes on Western Samoa at McDiarmid Park,
Perth, tonight.
Both men have been named as replacements for the international at
Murrayfield on Saturday, so they have had to relinquish their places in
the combined districts team.
The decision is a blow to Manson who, unless he comes on as a
replacement, will miss the chance to play against the Samoans. Moreover,
given that Manson has just returned to rugby after injury, an outing for
him tonight against stiff opposition would have provided the selectors
with information of his readiness to take his place on the bench at
Murrayfield.
The removal of the two players was ''anticipated' by Ian Rankin, the
districts coach. ''The possibility had been known to us for some time,''
he said. Willie Anderson is promoted from the bench for Manson, while
Campbell's place at lock goes to Watsonians' utility forward Stuart
Grimes.
Rankin, having watched the Samoans in action at Inverleith and
Mansfield Park, knows what kind of rugby they will throw at his side.
''They are very good at playing continuity rugby and on the ball they
support from deep, run into spaces, and angle their lines of attack,''
he said.
North and Midlands -- S Burns (Edinburgh Acads); N Renton (Kirkcaldy),
P Rouse (Dundee HS FP), A Carruthers (Kirkcaldy), J Kerr (Watsonians); M
McKenzie, K Harper (both Stirling County); T Smith (Watsonians), R
Cairney (Stirling County), W Anderson (Kirkcaldy), S Grimes
(Watsonians), S Hamilton (Stirling County), D McIvor (Edinburgh Acads,
captain), M Waite (Edinburgh Acads), G Flockhart (Stirling County).
Replacements -- J Mitchell (Kirkcaldy), B Easson (Boroughmuir), R
Dewar (Kirkcaldy), B Ireland (Stirling County), D Herrington, S Brown
(both Kirkcaldy).
Western Samoa -- A Autagavaia; T Faaiuaso, K Tuigamala, S Leaega, F
Fereti; C Burnes, M Vaea; B Reidy, T Leota, G Latu, M Birtwhistle, S
Lemamea, L Taala, S Smith, M Iupeli (captain).

THE Scottish international squad face a six-day Test match media ban
under the terms of the contract which the Scottish Rugby Union wants
them to sign by tomorrow. The contract, which is now worth #25,000 if
the Scots win Saturday's Murrayfield game against the Western Samoans,
as well as their four games in the Five Nations tournament, is with the
players' lawyer.
There is growing doubt over whether the deal will be sealed in time
for the Samoan game.
The ban on speaking to the media, which also includes newspaper
columns, comes into force 72 hours before a game, and expires 72 hours
afterwards.
Currently three players write regular columns, the captain Rob
Wainwright, stand-off Craig Chalmers and winger Kenny Logan, who has
occupied a regular Saturday slot in The Herald since the beginning of
the season.
Yesterday, SRU marketing manager Laura Dick declared: ''The contracts
might not yet have been signed, but the players know what our
expectations are of them. The situation is that a player may not speak
to the media, without our permission, during the 72 hours before and
after a game.
''What we are saying is that you might be able to speak to the media
or write your columns, but you can't do it without speaking to us first.
So far as any problems that might arise with players who write newspaper
columns is concerned, the only person who can resolve that is the player
himself.
''It is up to him to speak to the union and receive permission to
write a column. If consent is given then there is no problem,'' she
said.
''What we are doing is trying to ensure that there are no negative
vibes coming out of the game. We don't want players criticising
teammates, or the union or, after a game, the referee. The SRU is not
alone in this. This is the kind of contract that all Unions are putting
in place.''
Logan said yesterday: ''Obviously, I am placed in a difficult
position. I have a contract with The Herald and I'm faced with signing a
contract with the union which means that I have to contravene the terms
of the other one.
''I think we have to keep the thing in perspective. I would hope that
my columns have been entertaining and enjoyable but they have not, to my
knowledge, been overly controversial. There has been no criticism of
teammates or the rugby authorities. I will just have to speak to the SRU
to find out what the situation is going to be,'' he said.
Chalmers, who along with Wainwright is a team representative on the
International Players' Trust through which contract cash will be
channelled, said yesterday: ''Our lawyer is looking at the contract. The
union has been drawing it up for weeks and we are being asked to sign it
within a matter of days.
''Personally, I don't think it would create a major problem if it was
not signed before the Samoan game, which at this late stage is what we
should be focusing on absolutely.
''We certainly don't want to be signing something that we are not
entirely happy with, and nobody will be putting pen to paper until we
are all happy. The media ban is, obviously, an area which causes us some
concern,'' he said.
The players' agent, the former Scotland captain Ian McLauchlan, said
last night: ''The media ban doesn't make much sense to me. The rugby
public is desperate to hear from the players. The columns, in
particular, give a player's insight into what is happening in the game
and so far as I'm concerned they are very positive and what people want
to read.''
* ENGLISH rugby officials believe that the imminent threat of legal
action from Newcastle owner Sir John Hall has been shelved -- despite
Twickenham refusing to yield to the second division club on the
registration and relegation issues.
Tony Hallett, Rugby Football Union secretary, met Sir John at
Twickenham yesterday, and told him that the 120-day registration rule
must stay in place and that bottom club Newcastle remain relegation
candidates, despite the expansion of division two from 10 to 14 clubs
this season.
Sir John has alluded to taking legal action against the RFU because
the star players that have arrived in the North East -- Rob Andrew, Dean
Ryan and Nick Popplewell -- are still barred from playing until the New
Year.

Glasgow 14, North 18.
* NORTH came from behind four times to beat Glasgow at New Anniesland
yesterday, and score their first victory in the Bank of Scotland Schools
District Rugby Championship. A last-minute try by hooker Ronald Oliveira
snatched North's historic win.
A drop goal by Craig Hodgkinson for Glasgow and a penalty equaliser by
Jon Montgomerie were the only scores of a dour first half-hour. Glasgow
however edged ahead just before the interval when Jackson scored in the
right corner.
North replied when Andy Frost dived over from a close-range lineout,
but two penalty goals by Hodgkinson, bracketing one by Montgomerie,
seemed enough to have given Glasgow victory. With time almost run out,
however, Oliveira dived over from a short penalty. Montgomerie added the
conversion.
It was a different story in the Under-16 match, however, with Glasgow
defeating the North by 77-0.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
IT took him a while, but Derek McInnes finally realised his ambition
yesterday when he signed for Rangers from Morton in a #300,000 deal,
writes Ian Paul. The Greenock midfield player insisted, however, that
the prolonged negotiations did not prevent him giving of his best in his
series of farewell performances for the first division club.
''It was difficult at times otherwise,'' he said, ''because I was high
at one time and then down at another, depending on how it was going. It
is a big relief to have made the move I have always wanted. Obviously, I
would like to be part of the first team on a regular basis, but I know
that will be difficult. I feel I am capable of it, but it is up to me to
prove it.''
It is unlikely that his first experience of a Rangers shirt will be in
the Old Firm game on Sunday, but manager Walter Smith did not rule it
out. ''I would have no hesitation in involving him in that game, if we
had to,'' said the manager, who added that he had been impressed by
McInnes every time he had seen him.''
* GRAHAM Taylor yesterday bowed to public pressure and resigned as
manager of English first division strugglers Wolves.
Failure to beat a Charlton side reduced to 10 men for more than half
the match at Molineux on Sunday -- and a demonstration by angry fans
afterwards -- finally persuaded the 51-year-old former England manager
that he could no longer carry on.
After a meeting lasting several hours with chairman Jonathan Hayward,
club secretary Tom Finn announced that Taylor's 21-month reign was over.
Now speculation concerns who will take over with Chris Waddle, whose
England career ironically was ended by Taylor, and Manchester United
captain Steve Bruce among the names being linked with the job.
Taylor made a brief appearance before a packed news conference to say
in a prepared statement: ''It is with much regret that I have tendered
my resignation. I am sad because this has as much to do with matters off
the pitch as those on it. Obviously, the team has not been playing well.
But, only 13 weeks into the season, we are still in all competitions.''
As well as Waddle and Bruce, charismatic Coventry boss Ron Atkinson,
Millwall's Mick McCarthy and Danny Wilson of Barnsley are other possible
candidates for the post.
* ABERDEEN manager Roy Aitken yesterday revealed his main priority is
now to keep his born-again stars at Pittodrie. Seven first team players
are out of contract at the end of the season and he will use part of the
#2m available from their share issue and Coca-Cola Cup run to provide
new deals.
Eoin Jess, whose career has been resurrected by a masterstroke by
Aitken, will be first to be offered a record-breaking contract. Captain
Stewart McKimmie, sweeper Gary Smith, winger Joe Miller, defender Brian
Grant and keepers Theo Snelders and Michael Watt also feature in his
future plans.
Aitken said: ''I know excatly what is money is available to me, and
the directors will back any move I make to strengthen the team. But the
way the team has performed this season I do not see any real necessity
to bring in new players.''
* HIGH-tech communications equipment will supplement the referee's
traditional flag and whistle in an experiment at next year's Olympic
tournament to tighten match standards. FIFA said yesterday that linesmen
and women will wear electronic transmitters and referees will carry
receivers during the competition.
Linesmen will be able to send signals to alert referees to fouls. The
system will just be one-way. Referees will not be able to send signals
to the linesmen.
If successful, the experiment may be extended to other FIFA
competitions. The Olympic tournament takes place from July 20 to August
3.

YESTERDAY'S producer prices for October provided the strongest
indications yet that factory gate price inflation, the harbinger of
price increases in the shops, was close to its cyclical peak.
The seasonally adjusted core measure of factory gate prices held
steady at 5% in the three months to September, while the three-month
annualised rate has been dropping back from a peak of 5.7% in March.
Last month the core measure declined to 4.8% and the three-month
annualised rate fell from 4.8% to 4%, indicating further moderation in
the annual rate.
The fact that the broad measure of factory gate price inflation, which
is not seasonally adjusted, crept up from 4.5% to 4.6% tells us more
about past trends than the outlook.
The more encouraging output price numbers were accompanied by a sharp
drop in input price inflation to 7.8% against January's peak of 12.1%.
The pressures from the weak pound and the upsurge in commodity prices
are clearly abating.
However, it would be jumping the gun to conclude that the progress so
far merits a cut in interest rates. Underlying inflation, which excludes
mortgage interest payments, is not expected to reach its peak until
mid-summer, when it could be 1% above the Government's 2.5% target.
Undoubtedly though the producer price figures encouraged hopes of a
near-term cut in rates. The City is keen to see lower rates as soon as
possible rather than tax cuts in the Budget.
Meanwhile, the foreign exchange markets are all too well aware of
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's predicament. The fear is that he will err on
the side of generosity in fiscal or monetary policy or both.
Sterling is always exposed when the dollar is under pressure, on this
occasion from the tug-of-war between a Republican Congress and a
Democrat President over public borrowing.
But yesterday it lost ground to both the dollar and the mark and its
trade weighted index declined from 83.8 to 83.3 in response to the rate
speculation. Only last Thursday it stood at 84.5.
Whatever the Chancellor has up his sleeve for November 28, he should
be aware that continued weakness in sterling could quickly re-ignite the
inflationary pressures that now seem to be moderating.

* JEAN SCOTT, 54, FROM BISHOPBRIGGS, WON #796,183 IN FEBRUARY. THE
FAMILY HAD A WEEKLY RITUAL OF PICKING TWO SETS OF NUMBERS, ONE RANDOM,
ONE FIXED. ON SATURDAY FEBRUARY 4, JEAN OPTED FOR A THIRD ROW OF NUMBERS
ON IMPULSE.
''I WAS just sitting watching it on TV, counting out the numbers one
by one. Then I realised I had five plus the bonus number. It was just me
there, but one of my three daughters was in her room so I asked her to
come down and check them with me, and I realised I was right.
''The first thing I did was to phone my husband, Bill, down at the
local club. I told him, don't say anything to anybody because we don't
know how much we've won yet, but as soon as I walked in the door down
there, people were asking: 'Is that right Jean? Is that right?'.
''That night we put on Teletext and it said there had been four
winners and the amount of money was about #800,000, I didn't know that
was each, so I thought we had won #200,000. It wasn't until a lady from
Camelot phoned me the next morning. I felt sorry for her, she got out
the 'seven hundred thou' and that's when the phone went up in the air. I
couldn't believe it!
''The first thing we did was go down to Camelot on the Monday and get
the cheque, then we went back to Bishopbriggs, put the cheque in the
bank and went to the pub to have a drink, and we sat and thought about
it.
''We didn't go over the top, we didn't rush out and buy anything. But
we've done a lot since. In the past eight months in the house we've put
in all new windows, we've re-roofed, we've re-tiled the bathroom,
re-done the hall, the living-room. We put a big patio out the back and
every now and again we say, let's do this room. The money's there now
and we can.
''We also had a cruise in May to the Mediterranean, we went on the
Oriana, my husband, me, and my mother-in-law.
''Everybody has been great, we've not had any bad reactions at all.
It's not as if people stop talking to you. People still treat me the
same. They do joke, though, if we're on a night out, it's 'OK Jean,
you're on the bell then', that sort of thing, but that's just people
being funny.
''People have asked me if I can remember the numbers that won but I
just couldn't tell you what they were. They weren't special numbers at
all. That week we had added an extra line of random numbers and it was
those that won.
''We're still playing it, and we had four numbers in a row a month
after we won. We got #46 that time. We play it because we enjoy it, it's
just a bit of fun and we wouldn't go overboard on it.
''It's changed things a bit, I've stopped working, but it hasn't
changed us personally. It's allowed us to do the things we have always
wanted to do.''

INVESTORS in Sidlaw have been sorely battered in the last couple of
years, particularly in the pocket which must have felt as if there was a
hole in the lining. Having subscribed to a 275p-a-share rights issue in
1993 and a 180p call last year, yesterday's 8p rise in the share price
to 156p must seem the first light on the horizon after a year which saw
pre-exceptional profits halving to #7.27m and the pre-tax total running
into a #112,000 loss after allowing for exceptional costs largely
relating to the now sold-off textiles business.
This is the time for new investors to take an interest.
Sidlaw is something of a hybrid. On one side there is the relatively
stable oil services division, where the increasing amount of long-term
contract work does provide insulation against the worst of the vagaries
of the oil price and fluctuating demand from the oil companies. The
other side is much more cyclical -- and shareholders will have taken
that on board. Packaging has a definite cycle and is prey to the erratic
pricing of film.
But what is important about yesterday's figures is the feeling that
Sidlaw has got its house in order and is gaining market share in both
the UK and continental Europe with excellent long-term business with
both Associated British Foods and KP Foods as well as consolidating its
position with almost all its multi-national food manufacturing clients.
With about 5% to 6% of both markets and also probably sitting at
number four, it is in a very exposed position where it can only
safeguard itself through thinking faster and taking market share away
from the dozier majors and, as is more likely, from less well-financed
smaller competitors.
However, the crucial investment point is that the dividend total has
been marginally increased to 11p to put Sidlaw on a very attractive 8.8%
yield and that does seem safe even if the payout will not be covered by
earnings until the year after next.

SCOTLAND'S bowlers suffered further frustration in the European Indoor
Team Championship in Jersey yesterday, winning all three of their
triples matches but losing in the pairs to drop eight points behind
leaders, Wales, in the overall standings.
That leaves the Scots in joint third place with Ireland, just behind
England who are four points ahead.
Two of yesterday's triples successes came from Scotland's women, Kate
Adams, Jeanette Conlan, and Joyce Lindors, with the other coming from
Willie Galloway, Graham Robertson, and Angus Blair.
Lindores put the first points on the board for the Scots when two
successive 4s on the second and third last ends helped her side to a
21-8 win over Dessa Baird's Irish side. Later, they battled to a 16-14
win over home side Karina Horman, Sheila Syvret, and Jean Lowery.
Blair's side picked up their first points of the event, and with some
style. They beat Frank Hambly's Jersey trio 25-8 after having opened a
24-0 advantage before the luckless channel islanders opened their
account with a thirteenth end double.
Former world indoor singles champions Sarah Gourlay and Jan Woodley
tumbled to double defeat. They took a 5-0 lead against Ireland's Muriel
Wilkinson and Margaret Johnston, but then saw the Irish recover to win
26-17. And last night they were in all sorts of bother against Welsh
pair Cynthia Morgan and Julie Davies. With 14 ends played the Scots
trailed 3-24 and finally lost 11-31.
David Gourlay and Hugh Duff lost their only match yesterday, going
down 17-22 to Welsh pair Stephen Rees and Robert Weale. Results:
Women. Pairs -- Ireland 26, Scotland 17; England 20, Guernsey 18;
Wales 21, Jersey 13; England 22, Jersey 14; Wales 31, Scotland 11;
Ireland 18, Guernsey 15. Triples -- Scotland 21, Ireland 8; Wales 17,
Jersey 16; Guernsey 19, England 17; Scotland 16, Jersey 14; Wales 19,
Guernsey 10; England 17, Ireland 10.
Men. Pairs -- England 25, Jersey 10; Guernsey 21, Ireland 19; Wales
22, Scotland 17. Triples -- Scotland 25, Jersey 8; Wales 30, Guernsey 7;
England 21, Ireland 11.

THOSE earning more than #26,000 a year would be asked to pay ''just
that bit more'' by an SNP government in return for a costed package on
jobs, education and social justice to protect the social cohesion of
Scottish society, the party said yesterday.
Party leader Alex Salmond, setting out the party's budget, said he
believed Scottish voters would reward its courage for laying out in full
a budget which set out what could be done, what it would cost, and how
it would be paid for.
In addition to long-standing commitments such as restoring benefits to
16 and 17-year-olds, full nursery education provision, the cutting of
VAT on domestic fuel, and help for the elderly, the budget sprang some
surprises.
One idea was that instead of ''windfall tax'' clawbacks on public
utilities, the power and telephone companies should be made to scrap
standing charges for the elderly.
Built in to its costings over a four-year period were #75m to bring
back into full public ownership Railtrack's assets should these be sold
off, and #15m to buy the Skye Bridge, so that tolls could be reduced to
a comparable figure to that of other such bridges.
There also was a heavy shot across the bows of British Gas to the
effect that if it did not cease what the SNP claimed was discriminatory
pricing policies for landing supplies in Scotland, a future Scottish
government would renationalise the pipe network of its Transco
subsidiary north of the Border.
Mr Salmond said its distinctively Scottish economic proposals would
bring in #3bn by increasing growth by an extra half of one per cent
annually relative to England and Wales, citing the example of similarly
resource-rich Norway which has outstripped the British performance by a
full one per cent.
The projections would enable an independent Scotland to reduce the
jobless figures by 116,500, in turn increasing tax revenues.
The lowest paid would have a new lower rate of 15% of income tax,
while the threshold for going on to the continued existing top rate of
40% would be raised.
This would compensate for the scrapping of the upper limit on
employees' National Insurance contributions, which Mr Salmond conceded
would affect middle and higher income taxpayers.
He said 85% of the population would be better off, while the
remainder, those on #26,000 would pay more -- ''nothing draconian, just
that bit more,'' said Mr Salmond. ''We're not going to duck the point
that we think that higher earners should pay more for services so that
the lower paid can keep more of their money,'' he said.
Mr Salmond produced figures showing that those on incomes between
#7600 and #22,500 would be #3.75 a week better off, and someone on
#25,000 would be #1.67 a week better off. Someone such as an MP on
#33,500 would be #7.04 a week worse off.
''People in that income bracket, like myself, will regard that as a
necessary step to take to protect the cohesion of Scottish society by
providing for jobs, education, and social justice,'' he said.
A series of senior party figures, led by Mr Salmond and Treasury
spokesman John Swinney, warned yesterday that political opponents should
respond with the detail merited by setting out the plans in this way and
not just dismiss them as fantasy.
However, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson immediately dubbed
it ''another pathetic back-of-the-envelope budget'' adding to the
Nationalists' ''ever-growing wish list'' and based on ''the politics of
the never-never.''
For the Scottish Conservatives party vice-chairman Jackson Carlaw said
.the document was ''the latest Alex in Wonderland fantasy figures'' with
huge social spending which contradicted hopes for an economic boost,
calling for defence cuts yet promising jobs.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats' federal president Robert Maclennan
said: ''These proposals are fit for Fairyland but are not good enough
for Scotland. The underlying assumptions are pure guesswork.''
However, the SNP is sufficiently confident that its detailed figures
will withstand scrutiny that it has created a lengthy video documentary
-- along the lines of an extended party-political broadcast -- which now
will be taken round a series of campaign meetings to set off discussion.
A SCOTTISH parliament should be free to voice Scotland's view of world
issues, especially when it conflicts with that of the Westminster
Parliament, according to a new booklet launched yesterday.
Living in the Real World has been launched by Scottish Education and
Action for Development (SEAD). Written by Mr Kevin Dunion, director of
Friends of the Earth Scotland and a former SEAD chairman, it argues the
parliament must have power ''to articulate Scotland's distinctive view
of world events, particularly where that view differs from the stance
being adopted by the UK Government''.

SCOTTISH Housing Minister Raymond Robertson yesterday challenged the
private sector to embrace fully a Glasgow City plan to heat 80,000
council homes by the year 2002 as Labour housing affairs spokesman John
McAllion queried the validity of the Government's new Public Finance
Initiative.
The Glasgow energy initiative represents the first major potential PFI
housing project in Scotland. The council is seeking a European partner
to help fund the #500m installation of central heating systems
throughout the city.
The initiative follows the launch recently of another major Scottish
response to PFI, Canmore Partnership, a consortium which includes
Glasgow construction firm MPM Adams and Noble &amp; Company, Edinburgh-based
corporate finance specialists.
At the city chambers energy seminar, Mr Robertson said: ''The total
annual value of capital spending for which the Secretary of State for
Scotland is responsible is #2bn, and nearly half of that is the
responsibility of local authorities.
''There is therefore a very substantial potential for using
private-sector finance to meet public-sector needs and secure necessary
investment sooner than would otherwise have been possible.''
What was new in both style and structure was PFI, the Minister added,
with a planned systematic use for public capital requirements and
emphasising a transfer of risk and responsibility to the private sector.
He warned that the reality was that, without PFI, authorities would
not be able to afford many of the capital projects they would like to
pursue.
Mr McAllion congratulated Glasgow on its proposed heating development
which, if realised, should produce a highly affordable scheme.
''This is the kind of project we like to hear about, because it is so
specific in both timescale and details,'' he said.
''The Labour Party has been looking at private and public partnerships
for a number of years but we remain both sceptical and critical of PFI,
especially when it involves the National Health Service.
''We are not convinced the Government has the best interests of either
the economy or country at heart,'' he said.
Yet his party remained enthusiastic about public and private
partnerships.
More than 200 delegates attended the half-day seminar.

In the second of a series of pre-Budget articles by leading Scottish
figures from commerce and industry, Sandy Findlay, chairman and chief
executive of the Hewden Stuart Group, offers some advice to the
Chancellor on stimulating the housebuilding and construction industry
THE Chancellor of the Exchequer has the advice of the ''six wise men''
available to him, and the best talent in every department in Whitehall
and every financial institution in the City. If only he could satisfy
them all.
Given the opportunity, I would suggest to him certain measures which
would help stimulate housebuilding and the construction industry, while
reducing the number of unemployed in the country.
HOUSEBUILDING
The decline of the Tory Party's fortunes coincides with the decline of
the housing market and the disillusionment of many house-owners who were
encouraged during the eighties by the Conservative Party to buy their
own homes.
Nevertheless, the basic principle of home ownership is still valid,
providing houses are bought for homes and not for investment, with
proper controls over lending. The family home is recognised as the
single major investment in most peoples' lives and should be encouraged.
Much talked about in recent times has been the Private Finance
Initiative and there is no better example than the private house, since
the alternative is housing provided by the state or local authority and
this is no longer regarded as a desirable option.
Stamp duty applied to house purchase should be abolished and relief on
mortgage interest should be restored instead of reduced. These measures
would rejuvenate the flagging housing market and encourage people to
think longer term, providing they would not be taxed in a different way.
The very wealthy can avoid inheritance tax by employing advisers to
ensure this, but at the current threshold level of #154,000, ordinary
families now find that they are caught in the inheritance tax trap,
principally because the family home represents the bulk of their estate.
I would therefore propose that the family home up to a value of
#250,000 should be exempt from inheritance tax.
By regenerating the housing market, there is the added benefit of
increasing demand for white goods, carpets, etc, with the resultant
benefit to the economy as a whole.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
The temptation to reduce the general level of income tax should be
resisted, since it is far too costly, unlikely to benefit any specific
area of the economy and is more likely to be seen as a pre-election
gambit.
Greater benefit could be achieved by increasing public expenditure.
There is a proven need for investment in roads and bridges, schools and
hospitals and the present policy of withholding money provisionally
allocated for roadbuilding and maintenance can only be damaging to the
infrastructure in the long term.
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI), launched by Norman Lamont as
Chancellor in November 1992, has been high in expectation, but so far
quite low in achievement, and in reality although many public projects
have been associated with PFI relatively few have come to fruition.
The Chancellor should introduce measures to ensure that projects under
#5m in value are able to avoid elaborate bureaucratic procedures in
order to release into the economy essential work which must be
undertaken if the infrastructure is not allowed to deteriorate whereby
even greater investment will be required at a later date.
VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY
The construction industry, and the plant hire industry in particular,
would benefit from a rethink of the measures introduced by the
Chancellor in his November 1994 Budget.
To apply vehicle excise duty for the first time on items of
construction and roadbuilding equipment such as road rollers, when in
fact such equipment never uses the roads once they are built, and to
class such equipment as road-going vehicles is an absolute travesty.
Previously construction equipment was taxed at the same level as
agricultural equipment and should remain so.
When you consider the plant hire industry accounts for approximately
65%-70% of all the construction equipment sold in the United Kingdom,
any cutback in investment as a result of reduced cash flow has a
knock-on effect, not only on the major manufacturers, but on all the
sub-suppliers such as engine and component manufacturers.
It is estimated there are some 40,000 construction equipment items
affected by this latest change in vehicle excise duty and with a minimum
additional levy of #100 per unit, this measure will cost the industry
#40m in one fell swoop.
SHARE OPTIONS
It is hoped that the Chancellor will be able to introduce taxation
measures which will recreate the benefits of share options which were
widely applied in our company to the benefit and motivation of so many
of our staff at all levels.
Fortunately I do not have to balance the books of the Treasury
Department, but the measures proposed would certain assist our
particular industry.

FINANCIAL SERVICES
MICHAEL Munro is leaving Quayle Munro, the small Edinburgh-based
investment and financial services company, which he co-founded 12 years
ago, but the reasons for his departure are unclear.
Quayle Munro said yesterday that Mr Munro, 51, would step down as an
executive director on November 30, leaving the company's other
co-founder, chief executive Ian Quayle Jones, in sole charge.
Asked about the reasons for Mr Munro's departure, Mr Jones said: ''It
was by mutual agreement, I don't want to say more than that.''
Quayle Munro, which employs only eight people, functions as a
financial adviser and mini-merchant bank. It was floated on the stock
market two years ago, but Mr Munro retains an 8.5% stake.
Mr Jones said the company was looking for new staff to fill the gap
left by Mr Munro and cope with expanding business. He expects to
announce new appointments within two or three months.
Quayle Munro's recent work has included acting as an adviser to
British Polythene Industries in its #24m takeover of Parkside
Industries, a company in which Quayle Munro formerly owned shares.
It has also acted as an adviser to the Scottish Office on proposals to
open Highlands and Islands Airports to private investment.
Quayle Munro made a pre-tax profit of #674,000 in the year to June 30.
Its shares closed unchanged at 180p.

THIS year's Hogmanay celebrations in Edinburgh will embrace a
child-friendly policy for the first time.
The extended five-day programme includes a series of events catering
for children.
From December 29 until January 2, theatre, puppet shows, and pony and
trap rides on High Street are planned. There will also be ice skating on
top of the city's Waverley Market.
The initiative is backed by Edinburgh District Council, Lothian
Regional Council, and Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited, along
with organisers Unique Events.
While the torchlight procession, Hogmanay carnival, and concert in
Princes Street Gardens have provided family entertainment over the last
three years, the new programme is said to be the first devised for
children.

PROPERTY
VICO, the Glasgow-based property company, has received a further
#500,000 boost from venture capital firm 3i and is also raising #1.5m in
bank loans to finance new projects.
The #2m capital addition was announced as Vico unveiled a 34% increase
in pre-tax profits to more than #800,000.
The new money will be used to help finance the purchase of two small
property portfolios in the Central Belt.
Vico, which has offices in Glasgow, Belfast and Manchester,
specialises in retail developments carried out in partnership with major
High Street chains, predominantly in Scotland.
The company shuns speculative developments and its prudent approach
has enabled it to ride out the recession in the commercial property
market unscathed.
''They are very risk averse and conservative in their attitude to
financial management and that has fed through to the bottom line in
recent years,'' said 3i investment executive Roy McKelvie.
The latest capital injection boosts 3i's equity stake in Vico to 28%
from 19%. 3i made an initial investment of #1m in Vico three years ago.

THE Sidlaw packaging and oil services group was hard hit by sharply
rising film prices last year with it becoming more difficult to recoup
these from customers as the year progressed.
As a result, pre-tax profits slumped 51% to #7.27m and after the
inclusion of exceptional debits largely relating to write-downs on the
now sold-off textile activities, there was a pre-tax loss of #112,000.
However, there has been a slight increase in the dividend total to 11p
with a 6.5p final.
That combined with a reasonably positive outlook from chief executive
Digby Morrow helped push the shares up 8p to 156p where they yield 8.8%.
Polythene and polypropylene prices soared to the extent that they
added #17.5m to group costs. Sidlaw was unable to recover more than
about #7m from customers who had at times to be approached monthly for
higher prices.
However, sales volumes did rise 3%, unit costs were 5% lower --
together worth about #3.4m to profits although there was also some #2.1m
of exceptional reorganisation charges as some 30% of UK film printing
press capacity was consolidated into three sites.
There was the bonus that one major UK competitor has decided to
withdraw from supplying bread bags to Associated British Foods which
left Sidlaw with an excellent opportunity to reinforce its position as
the dominant supplier as is also the case at crisps manufacturer KP.
It has a blue chip portfolio of multi-national clients such as Mars,
Unilever, Nestle, Campbell and so on and in almost all cases it has
raised volume with the top 12 customers.
There have been unspecified delays in the proposed start-ups of new
projects in Europe, one involving new technology, and these seemto be on
the back burner for some time yet. That has left Sidlaw with about #14m
cash arising from the #23.7m rights issue last autumn although gearing
at present at 62% is above the company's own self-imposed limit of 60%.
Short term that will increase slightly partly because of the cash flow
pattern in the oil division.
That saw level pegging in profits at #6.92m with Sidlaw gaining more
customers among the oil majors as well as the initial benefits from
establishing a Supplylink base in Norway. That will give customers
access to Sidlaw services covering the whole of the North sea from the
Dutch gas fields northwards. There are also benefits arising from
technical innovations such as small coiled tubing.
Current year profits should improve to about #8[1/2]m to leave the
shares trading at 17 times possible earnings -- a crucial factor will be
the trend of film pricing but so far it is looking promising.

Christopher Dobson reports that Saudi Arabia has been shaken to its
foundations by the bomb attacks on an American base
THE car bombs which killed five Americans in Riyadh yesterday were
planted with two objectives. They gave force to the Islamicists' demands
that the American ''Unbelievers'' should leave Saudi Arabia and they
demonstrated that the pot of insurrection is boiling over in this
discontented land.
The presence of American servicemen and, especially, women has been
bitterly resented by most Saudis ever since King Fahd had to call in
America and its allies to protect his country from Saddam Hussein in the
Gulf war. Their desert pride was hurt by the realisation that their
golden swords were no good against Saddam's tanks; and the sight of
bare-legged, bareheaded American women soldiers armed with automatic
rifles drove the fervent Islamicists to a frenzy of religious fury.
They had hoped that the end of the war would see the end of the
Western mililtary presence but British, American and French aircraft
remained in their northern bases to police the air exclusion zone of
Southern Iraq and a team of US advisers set up a training mission for
the National Guard in Riyadh.
It was these advisers who were attacked today. At first sight it would
seem to be gross carelessness on the part of the Americans to allow the
car bombers to drive their deadly vehicles into the car park adjacent to
their training headquarters, especially after receiving two public
warnings from the rebel Jihad Liberation Movement to leave Saudi Arabia.
After all, the Americans have had tragic experiences with suicide car
bombers in Beirut where the US Marine Corp headquarters was devastated
by a bomb which killed 241 marines.
But what is not clear yet is just how much control the American
mission had over its own security. It is probable that the Saudi
National Guard, which prides itself on being much more efficient than
the army, would have insisted on retaining operational control over
security.
It is here that the bombings move from being an attack on the
Americans to being part of the unrest in this extraordinary country
where the modern and the medieval are in conflict.
The National Guard is in the personal control of the Royal Family.
They are, literally, household troops, commanded by Prince Abdullah,
brother and probably successor to the ailing King Fahd. Any failure on
the part of the National Guard not only reflects on its efficiency but
causes Abdullah great loss of face and sends shivers down the royal
family's spines.
It has much to be apprehensive about. During the glory days of
petro-dollars when Saudi Arabia was making as much as $100 billion a
year, life was great for the Saudis and especially for the Al-Saud
dynasty which now numbers around 7000 princes and princesses. Schools,
medicines, the telephone and most social services were free. Other
services virtually so. Cars that ran out of petrol really were abandoned
in the desert.
Those days are gone. Gross extravagances, gambling, the slump in oil
prices, millions given to Saddam Hussein to help him fight his war
against Iran, and the Saudi debt on the Gulf war have stopped all that
and there is great discontent in the land.
There is an epidemic of crime. There are now so many public executions
that the number of days on which they can take place has been increased.
Nothing can keep the lid on the religious discontent which is
spreading through the land. The Shia minority who live in the Eastern
Province and actually work in the oilfields and are paid a wage rather
than having money showered on them are displaying the same sort of
discontent that provoked the Shia revolt in the Lebanon, and they have
the same support from the Iranian mullahs who would like nothing better
than to see the Saudi royal family go the same way as the Shah of Iran.
For the moment the Shias are under control. Far more dangerous are the
militants who first gave notice of their discontent by seizing the Grand
Mosque in the holy city of Mecca in 1979. They were wiped out but their
audacity sent shock waves through the kingdom. Now, with the royal
family unable to placate their subjects with money, Islamic fanaticism
is gaining ground, as it is throughout the rest of the Middle East.

<HEADLINE>The tiny island of Unst could house the UK's most violent criminals, says a consultant. Scotland's answer to Alcatraz</HEADLINE>

IT HAS the birdman, though it's short on sharks to make it a real
Devil's Island. This deficiency, however, has not deterred a consultant
from floating the idea that Unst, Scotland's most northerly island,
could become a British Alcatraz.
The high-security prison is just one of a series of proposals put
forward by Shetland consultant Barry Stevens, who was commissioned to
prepare a report on alternative uses for the airport -- the second
biggest employer on the island with 44 jobs -- which faces closure next
year on the tiny, barren island.
Mr Stevens admits that his suggestions are ''weird'' but says they are
''valid'' and claims any one of them could secure the future of the
island and its 1100 population. He has presented his report to the Unst
Development Forum, which is examining his conclusions.
He said the idea of Britain having a super-maximum security prison had
come under the spotlight after HM Prison Service announced last week
that it was considering a site for such a project.
The Alcatraz-style idea arose after Parkhurst, on the Isle of Wight,
one of six high-security prisons used in the UK for the country's most
dangerous and violent criminals, was downgraded following various
incidents including the escape of prisoners, in recent months.
However, Mr Stevens thinks Unst is the answer. ''It is remote,
surrounded by water, and has an airport for transporting prisoners --
and visitors -- on and off the island.
''The workforce needed to construct it would ensure the livelihoods of
local industry for a long time. Direct employment would also stem from
the daily needs of the prison.''
Mr Stevens has suggested an urgent approach to the Home Office about
his idea.
To get it off to a flyer, the island already boasts its own birdman --
known to locals as Albert Ross. Albert, an albatross, has been an annual
visitor to the Herma Ness Nature Reserve for 20 years. Bird experts
believe the large seabird got lost from its southern ocean home and
ended up in the north. It returns to Shetland each summer to find a
mate.
And the bird is exactly what HM Prison Service yesterday gave Mr
Stevens's proposal. A spokesman said: ''Is Unst surrounded by sharks?''
He added that he doubted that Shetland would be considered. ''We are
looking at the feasibility of the prison project, and are at an early
stage, but Shetland does not sound appropriate.
''The super-maximum prison would be a concentrated prison for armed
robbers, serial murderers, dangerous murderers, terrorists, and those
involved in organised crime, such as drugs and guns.''
Mr Stevens's idea also met with a cool response from Shetland Islands'
councillor for Unst, Ms Joan Easten. She said she would be appalled if
dangerous criminals were taken to the tranquil surroundings of Shetland,
and particularly Unst. ''There must be better ways of securing the
future of Unst and its airport.''
Mr Stevens's other proposals include Unst becoming a base for
psuedo-military training, a war-games centre or a heritage village
reflecting life of 100 to 200 years ago.

Geoffrey Parkhouse, Political Editor, reports that, during a critical
fortnight for the Tories, the Government aims to use the Queen's Speech
and the Budget to woo voters away from Labour and keep them in the
Conservative fold until a General Election
IN an ideal Tory world tomorrow's Queen's Speech, setting out
legislation for the next 12 months, and the Budget 13 days later will
both embarrass Tony Blair and restore the affections of disenchanted
voters to John Major. It may be his last chance to do so.
Social reform is to be the theme of the speech. This means a package
of measures seeking to ensure that our legal structures fully reflect
social changes. The adoption of unwanted children is to be simplified,
for example. Counselling prior to a quickie ''no blame'' divorce is on
offer for England from the Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay.
These are intended to give the Government a good, up-to-date image
without splitting the Tories at Westminster. The spine of the social
reform theme will be found in education and law and order Bills. These
are the popular causes that could wrong-foot Mr Blair and maybe even
split the Labour Party.
Home Secretary Michael Howard intends to make it much tougher on
criminals, who were warned by him at the Tory Party conference last
month: ''If you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime.'' Longer
sentences are on their way.
Defence lawyers may find it more difficult to see in advance the full
details of a prosecution case. They may even have to produce more of
their own case in advance of a trial. If Mr Blair opposes Howard's new
Criminal Justice Bill, he might find his ''tough on crime and tough on
the causes of crime'' slogan wrapped round his neck. Ditto with more
rigorous measures on ''political asylum'' and illegal immigration.
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard is pivotal to the Tory theme for
next session. She proposes private finance for schools and an increase
in the number of assisted places in private education. Essex man and
woman may like these ideas, but Labour is bound to oppose them. The
long-awaited voucher scheme for primary education is expected to be
enhanced by the #800m budget increase that Mrs Shephard is alleged to
have achieved.
Ministers think they are on an education winner in the Queen's Speech.
Furthermore, if Peter Lilley can produce another raft of changes in
social security which both save money, cut out fraud and target benefits
to the needy, Tory MPs will be heartened and Labour challenged.
This will be the last full legislative programme for Parliament if Mr
Major goes to the General Election buffers in June/July, 1997. After
this time next year, if the Government survives that long, Ministers
would find themselves in the situation in which they have to negotiate
with the Opposition to place their Bills on the Statute Book.
So tomorrow is pretty well the last chance for Mr Major to put, in
terms of legislation, ''clear blue water'' between himself and Mr Blair.
This is one reason why we can expect him to act now on ideas despised by
old Labour and even by elements of new Labour.
By this means Ministers hope to be seen to be doing things that not
only unite their backbenchers but also attract their erstwhile voters.
The hope is that over the next six months Labour's colossal lead in the
opinion polls will be reduced sufficiently for the Tories to regain the
political initiative. This may be easier to attempt in the Queen's
Speech than in the Budget.
It is left to Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and the Prime Minister to
resolve the central dilemma of Budget Day, November 28: does the
Government conduct it to win, or to play safe? Despite Cabinet meetings
on the legislative programme on the economy and public expenditure, it
is hard to create a collective strategy that links the Queen's Speech
with the Budget as both are handled in isolation.
So, if the two most important items in the Government's strategy are
to be linked it is only Mr Major and Mr Clarke who can do it. Along with
the Chief Secretary, William Waldegrave, only they know the precise
state of public spending and borrowing. We have seen how the Social
Reform theme for the speech might be targeted to Conservative opinion in
the country. Is this what Mr Clarke should be concentrating on in his
Budget?
Whatever he does must be fiscally prudent, otherwise the markets will
shoot him down. Within this confine, colleagues (who won't know the
details until Budget Day morning), believe he has two broad options. If
he wants to play safe he will concentrate on getting people back to work
and family credits, plus reducing costs to employers. He could perhaps
focus on reducing inheritance tax (good for family business) and capital
gains tax (good for the individual investor).
Then there is the ''Go For Broke'' Budget play, what some would call a
Conservative Budget. A reduction in the standard rate on earned income,
plus other targeted tax cuts favourable to the kind of people who used
to support the Tory Party. The trouble with this proposition is that the
political fallout is difficult to quantify. Only yesterday, the CBI
warned that it would rather have Britain's infrastructure,
competitiveness and workforce skills improved than even limited tax
cuts.
Mr Blair could make much of that. Furthermore, if the Chancellor sets
about his task of helping to give his party a chance at the next General
Election too blatantly, Mr Blair will make much of that too. The voters
still recall the pre-election tax-cut promises last time and the extra
seven pence in the pound that they have endured since. I can hear Mr
Blair now, describing the Chancellor's strategy as reckless. If the
financial markets took the same view, the Government would be facing a
crisis in the run up to an election, with nobody to blame but itself.
So I imagine that Mr Clarke will try to adhere to what he calls his
''good government'' policy. In this he might be able to depend on
forecasts on real disposable income increasing faster, plus some
''windfall'' gains for consumers. Still, there must be tax cuts of some
kind to redeem, if only in part, the last Tory election pledge. His
backbenchers, his ministerial colleagues, and his party activists all
say with a loud voice: ''Without some tax cuts, we are gonners.''
Obviously, they all say, cuts should be targeted to the best advantage
of the majority of taxpayers with the middle classes to be borne vividly
in mind. Only in this way would the Government gain a political benefit.
But Mr Clarke has declared often enough that tax cuts must be affordable
and prudent. This is where the settlement on state spending for the next
18 months is vital.
The final negotiations on outstanding departmental budgets were
supposed to have been settled at another full Cabinet meeting, but this
was cancelled to accommodate the Prime Minister's attendance at the
funeral of Yitzhak Rabin in Jerusalem and the Commonwealth Conference in
New Zealand. Deals were done by telephone, by Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth and others, over the preceding weekend.
Perhaps this last-minute urgency helped the Chancellor and his Chief
Secretary, for the first time since 1979, to make genuine and trenchant
inroads into state spending. Perhaps Mr Clarke does have more than #5
billion as a result to redeploy in revenue relief. It might then be
''prudent'', say some of his backbenchers, to go for a healthy cut in
the standard rate.
But others are concerned that in making a dash for reducing public
expenditure down towards a target of below 40% of the gross national
product (GDP), their Government may damage infrastructure, rather than
improve it. For example, the construction industry, big employers, needs
only another major blow to ruin it. There are more kinds of policy
prudence than mere taxation.
There is a definite steer concerning the Chancellor's strategy on
November 28 and this is the thinking of Ministers concerning the actual
timing of the next General Election. I am told that ''everyone'' is
planning on the basis of another Budget and another Queen's Speech this
time next year.
This seems at first a slender prospect, now that the Tory majority, at
least technically speaking, has fallen to between five and seven. But
Ministers believe that they will be supported by David Trimble's Ulster
Unionists, who sit on the Opposition benches, against any attempt to
force a General Election sooner than 1997. The theory is that as long as
the Tories are in power, Mr Trimble (like Mr Molyneaux before him) will
have considerable influence; but this would be gone, come a Labour
Government.
No doubt the outburst from Irish Premier John Bruton over the weekend
trying to push Mr Major into talks before an IRA handover of weapons
will serve to underline the force of this theory. So Mr Major is
calculating on being able to carry on until 1997, despite any attempt by
Mr Blair -- who would wish an election sooner -- to ambush him in the
Commons. Certainly, as the Queen's Speech will demonstrate, Mr Major
will avoid doing anything to provoke a rebellion on his own benches.
If these are to be the circumstances, then it makes sense for the
Chancellor to err on the side of fiscal prudence this time and not fire
all his ammunition in one go. Also, the longer the Government survives,
the longer it has to change the mood of the country. And, as one
commentator observed yesterday: ''Mood matters more than maths.''

Two positive initiatives have made people more aware of dyslexia
recently, writes JOAN McFADDEN. But for eight-year-old Andrew Wilson,
it's still . . .
ANDREW WILSON is like any other eight-year-old boy. He is interested
in all the current trends, enjoys the rough and tumble of family life
with his brother and sister, and likes school. His only complaint is
that he finds he has to work harder than the rest of his classmates to
get the same results, and even then he is very philosophical about the
extra effort he has to make.
Andrew is dyslexic and describes the condition as having ''the wires
crossed in your brain''. He attends the local primary school in Colinton
on the outskirts of Edinburgh and normally does not like to talk about
his dyslexia because it is ''a problem that does not go away and that
upsets me''.
He does the same group work as everyone else and does not want to be
treated any differently. Although determination alone is not enough to
overcome dyslexia, there is help available.
Dyslexia is a much-used term, and is often wrongly applied to other
learning difficulties. The professionals describe it as a specific
information-processing difficulty that is neurological in basis and
tends to run in families. It affects people to varying degrees, and is
more common in boys than girls. Reading, writing, spelling and
handwriting skills can be harder for the dyslexic individual to acquire,
and mathematics and musical notation can also create problems.
The last two weeks have seen two very positive initiatives in
educating both professionals and the public about dyslexia. The Dyslexia
Institute has just completed its annual Awareness Week, with the
prevailing theme being action on literacy.
The body prides itself on highly-specialised teaching of dyslexic
children and adults and claims long-standing success in this area, with
a network of 22 centres and more than 130 teaching and training
outposts. Its aim is to provide the best possible service and support
for everyone who comes to it. It also offers advice, assessment,
teaching and training courses.
And two weeks ago, Tayside region hosted a conference entitled
Dyslexia -- Releasing the Potential. One hundred professional and
parental delegates attended from across Tayside to listen to the guest
speaker, Thomas West, who has made a study of the connections between
creative abilities, visual thinking and academic learning difficulties.
He places great emphasis on the differences in each situation. At its
simplest level, different tools are required for dyslexia, because
different people have different problems. Another speaker, the
successful artist McKenzie Thorpe who also suffers from dyslexia,
perfectly illustrated West's theory.
Delegates were also offered advice on setting up networks as a means
of providing help and information. Tayside believes the conference was
important in relation to its policies on dealing with specific learning
difficulties.
The authority's approach appears to bear out specialist advice that
early intervention offers the best chance to overcome or prevent
literacy failure. The assessment process can start as early as age two,
although in practice it is likely to happen at four, with the majority
actually being five-plus.
Because of the current lack of universal pre-school education in
Scotland, children are most likely to be assessed first in terms of peer
achievement in primary one. There are situations where health
professionals can be involved from a very early age, but that is most
likely to be in relation to conditions where learning difficulties are
innate.
The standard system of assessment is straightforward. If a parent
expresses any concerns about a child's progress this is treated in the
same way as when a teacher identifies the problem. Parents and teachers
work closely together in putting a child forward for assessment, and
there is a period of negotiation where parental input is of the utmost
importance. If a child is considered to be in need of supported
learning, then the region's aim is to identify all needs and make sure
they are met.
This policy is mirrored in Strathclyde and Lothian regions, but
although the majority of parents express some satisfaction with the help
on offer, they also find the whole system frustrating and the
practicalities involved hard work.
One mother says the last year has undermined her confidence in herself
as a parent, and at times left her feeling completely ignorant. Her
young son's learning difficulties were recognised by both his parents
and his school and he was put forward for assessment. Months later, he
is just about to begin supported learning, but the interim period has
been difficult for all the family.
His parents did not know how the system worked, how long it would be
before action would be taken, and what form any support would take.
Meanwhile, despite being bright and articulate, their son felt more and
more isolated within the classroom, which effectively disrupted the rest
of his life.
The problem, as usual, is finance. The nature of this condition means
that while talented people are struggling to express themselves,
insufficient specialist help leads to feelings of failure and lack of
confidence. Support groups such as the Dyslexia Institute are
invaluable, as is the Dyslexia Association, which provides a similar
service.
Andrew Wilson has four half-hour sessions per week of supported
learning provided by Lothian region, while his parents also pay for an
hour's session with Jacqueline Milligan, a tutor from the Dyslexia
Association. ''One third of the support a tutor can give is to keep the
pupil going, and make sure their morale is high,'' she believes.
Andrew's mother, Inez, is in total agreement as she helps him with his
homework and tries not to mind when he has had a particularly
frustrating day. She understands his wish to be treated in the same way
as everyone else, but would like to see more money put into the
provision of supported learning.
Andrew still manages to be optimistic. He would like to be an actor,
and although he recognises that a drama degree would involve great
effort on his part, he is quick to point out the one benefit he sees in
being dyslexic. ''You have to have a very good imagination, which is
really important for an actor.''

THE commencement of high-speed train services through the Channel
Tunnel was expected to impact on air travel and indeed it has. However,
on the evidence so far, airport operator BAA said the effect was not as
bad as it could have been.
Perhaps surprisingly the growth in tunnel custom has come from French
business travellers attracted by the comfortable hassle-free journey
between the two cities. As one who has used the Eurostar service from
London Waterloo, I can quite see why one would never travel by plane to
Paris again.
Fortunately for BAA, its provision of excellent retail and other
passenger facilities coupled with what are seen as increasingly
attractive aircraft charges means the overall business continues to
prosper. World economic growth together with British consumers'
increasing desire for overseas holidays augurs well for future passenger
numbers. UK passenger growth is forecast to continue increasing by 4%
annually until at least 2005.
Investment inside BAA's terminals is paying off. Its retail
performance is ahead of High Street competitors and even in Glasgow,
where passenger numbers were reduced, income grew by 9.5% reflecting the
greatly improved international facilities.
BAA has some ambitions overseas. It has recently taken over the
management of Indianapolis airport in the US and hopes to play a part in
the Australian privatisation process. However, the company is correct to
focus the bulk of its attention and investment on the core UK business
which has produced handsome returns to shareholders and provided
attractive facilities for passengers and airlines alike.
A combination of growing passenger numbers and expanding retail
activities has produced good earnings growth since privatisation in
1987. This has been accompanied by a premium rating and relative share
price out-performance.
While some uncertainties -- such as possible changes to the regulatory
environment following the election of a Labour government and the
abolition of intra-European duty free in December 1999 -- still exist,
there does appear to be a real prospect of BAA continuing to report
above average earnings growth. With this should come further
out-performance by the shares.

NINE years ago, when Burntwood School For Girls was formed by the
amalgamation of two schools, nobody could have predicted its success.
The schools, from which Burntwood in the south London borough of
Wandsworth was born, both had poor results with only about 17% of pupils
getting five or more grades A to C. And with half of the 1500 pupils
coming from economically deprived areas and 40% speaking a first
language that was not English, the odds on improvement did not look
good.
But almost a decade later Burntwood has undoubtedly beaten the odds.
Now 47% of pupils achieve five or more grades A to C above the national
average. The school has managed to develop an identity so strong that
the word Burntwood has become an adjective used by teaching staff,
pupils and the local community alike. Unsurprisingly, the school is now
heavily over-subscribed.
Burntwood is just one of 11 schools to feature in a report published
last week by the independent National Commission for Education. Success
Against the Odds tells how the schools from all four countries of the UK
have managed to overcome social and economic barriers to ''kick the
habit of failure''. Lochgelly North special school in Fife, the only
Scottish school in the report and whose success was featured in The
Herald last week, comes in for some of the highest praise.
The surveys of the 11 schools were carried out by teams of people from
the education and business worlds. These included Howard Davies, now
deputy governor of the Bank of England who was a member of the Burntwood
team; Professor John MacBeath of Strathclyde University's Quality in
Education centre; and Tim Brighouse, chief education officer for
Birmingham.
Success Against the Odds is the first national comparative study of
effective schools, and educationalists have hailed it as an important
step towards understanding the factors that can make schools successful
no matter what their circumstances. David Blunkett, the Shadow Education
Secretary, summed up the air of celebration at the report's launch.
''The schools in this book are an inspiration to all pupils, parents and
teachers,'' he said.
So what lessons can be learned from the report? In the final chapter
Josh Hillman, the commission's research officer at the time, and
Professor Margaret Maden of the University of Keele Centre For
Successful Schools say the schools had been ''stuck in a cycle of low
expectations, lack of direction and external perception of failure; most
had experienced inertia or had neglected to focus on or even recognise
the need to improve on a continuous basis.''
And while the answers are far from simple, the commission points to a
range of common factors at the heart of each school's success. Of these
the role and ability of the head teacher emerge as crucial. ''The right
sort of leadership is the heart of effective schooling and no evidence
of effectiveness in a school with weak leadership has emerged,'' it
says.
''In schools serving disadvantaged areas, an abundance of energy and
commitment is needed just to tread water. From these studies it is
apparent that an unusually high level of human effort is being spent in
a very focused way.''
At Burntwood this is certainly true. Of Brigid Beattie, who has been
principal since the school was established, the inspection team
concludes: ''The determination of a respected leader to push the
achievements of the school to the maximum appears to be a major factor
in the success of the institution.
''A vital characteristic of leadership in our judgment is the way the
principal is able to delegate to and support the various post-holders
with leadership roles within the school. We think this has led to a
willingness to take ownership of developing school policies and is clear
evidence of staff appreciation of this support.''
This does not mean, however, that a good head teacher alone is enough.
''Improvement is achieved by the whole school -- by the teachers but
also by the pupils; by all the staff not only the teachers; and by the
parents and the wider community.''
To achieve this ''whole school approach'' high expectations not just
of pupils and teachers but also of this school on the part of the
community it serves are crucial. The Burntwood inspection team was
''struck forcibly by how frequently we heard high expectations being
expressed of other people in this school''.
These are formally expressed in the Burntwood Agreement signed by
every new student, parent and the principal which lays out the rights
and responsibilities of each of the parties.
Pupil behaviour was also found to be a more important factor than was
previously thought, even though this was translated into very different
systems and policies by each of the schools. ''Good pupil behaviour was
seen to be an important precondition for staff motivation for
improvement and early identification of this was crucial.''
But perhaps the most significant aspect of the report is simply the
positive message it conveys -- that schools can break out of the cycle
of deprivation. ''Every school has the opportunity to succeed against
the odds,'' it says. ''None of the schools studied holds itself out as
exceptional or puts success down to any particularly gifted individual.
Nor does the possibility of success arise as a once-for-all gift-wrapped
opportunity. It is the steady accumulation day on day and week on week
of positive progress which emerges so clearly.''
Consider this good news message against the current backdrop of
English education. In the last month alone the Office for Standards in
Education has announced emergency inspections of all schools in two
London boroughs and Hackney Downs Comprehensive looks certain to shut
after being dubbed ''the worst school in Britain''.
Comments last week by Chris Woodhead, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of
Schools, that around 15,000 teachers are failing the country's children
are just the latest blow. Little wonder then that the report has been
embraced by an education system under constant attack.
The commission is the very antithesis of the approach by OFSTED and
the Government to improving education standards. While Chris Woodhead
and his inspection teams, encouraged by the Government, have opted to
focus on failure rather than improvement, and punishment rather than
support, the report points to the ''irresistible optimism'' that was
found in each of the schools.
And, backed up by the case studies, it demonstrates that improvement
cannot happen overnight. In the wake of the Hackney Downs closure, the
authors warn that ''more recent hurried strategies concerning failing
schools need to be rethought'' because the rate and nature of
improvement is often characterised by ''two steps forwards, one step
back''.
So if anything can be learned from Success Against the Odds it is that
the high-profile problems in education south of the border do not tell
the whole story. Schools, not just the 11 featured in the report but
thousands across the country, are succeeding every day.
Perhaps, as David Blunkett put it, we must ''learn to measure what we
value rather than value what we can measure''.

THE popular image of the war reporter is of someone cold and tough and
dispassionate. A person, usually a man, who has become hardened by his
experiences and by the horrors he has seen; someone who has learned
never to allow his heart to speak or his feelings to spill into his
journalism. But then popular images are often distorted.
Towards the end of his book, Martin Bell explains something of his
approach to the war in Bosnia by describing how he would like to adapt
one of the confessions of St Augustine: ''O Lord make me distant and
indifferent, but not yet.'' That says a great deal about his kind of
journalism.
It is committed journalism. It is something he has arrived at after 30
years on the staff of BBC television news, after assignments in 80
countries and after covering 11 wars, but it is what has happened, and
is happening, in Bosnia that has had a greater effect upon him than even
the accumulations of a lifetime spent in danger.
He puts it like this in a line from the text whih he clearly regards
as sufficiently important to have picked out for the back jacket: ''In
the news business it isn't involvement but indifference that makes for
bad practice. Good journalism is the journalism of attachment.''
He minds very much about Bosnia. It has obviously changed his personal
perspective of war and of his work. It has also provoked him into
writing his first book, which he says will also probably be his only
book. ''Something had happened to me of which I wanted to make some sort
of permanent record,'' he says.
We are talking at the back of a cheerful coffee bar during Martin
Bell's two weeks on the front line -- dare one be so frivolous about
someone who now limps as a result of being caught by a sniper's bullet
three years ago? -- of a publishing promotion. He is briefly back in
Britain from Bosnia, temporarily exchanging the delights of the Holiday
Inn, Sarajevo, for his cottage in Hampstead Garden Suburb where it is
initially hard to get to sleep at night without the customary noises of
sniper fire or mortars.
He is, incidentally, immensely fond of the hotel, the ultimate war
hotel which you do not have to leave to go out to the war, for it comes
in to you. He writes: ''The Holiday Inn does not do wake-up calls,
partly because its telephone service is temperamental and partly because
it doesn't need to. The mortar crews start early on both sides, plus the
machine-gunners, snipers and heavy artillery . . .''
The book was partly an act of what he terms filial piety. His father,
Adrian Bell, was an author, a novelist with 20 books of gentle country
stories published, and his grandfather Robert Bell was a journalist,
news editor of the Observer. Television journalist Martin Bell,
correspondent, as he describes himself, of the new world order, wanted
to put something down in print, partly because he is employed in the
most ephemeral branch of journalism.
He has, of course, no record of his work. ''I don't even write it
down. I don't have any scripts. I have notebooks with notes I can't
decipher.'' Most journalists have the option of stringing together old
stories like beads on a necklace, but for 30 years he had not even been
in the habit of writing grammatical sentences -- good television
reporting is not dependent on sentence construction. The book obliged
him to think a bit harder.
The genesis of the decision to write it, however, was much more the
nature of the war and its implications. He is interested in the extent
to which television reporting and the war and diplomacy overlap in a
grey area, in how much political pressure is exerted by journalism.
He is proud of being a founder member of the ''Something Must Be Done
Club'', something about the war in the Balkans. But his attached
journalism is, he points out, quite different for a television reporter
from the crusading journalism that some can try in print.
He has the curiosity of a 12 year old about what will happen, although
he says this with an awareness of his age. He is 57, was the oldest man
on the field of battle in the Gulf War, and these days is not carrying
the tripod as often as he used to either. ''It is pretty undignified. I
can't run as fast as I used to be able to and I don't want to be a
burden to the crew.'' But he knows, too, that camera crews like working
with old reporters, journalists who have made a reputation already,
people who know what they are doing, lucky people. He compares himself
to an old U-boat captain.
He says he doesn't know how to do anything else. He is a war reporter
because he has to earn a living. There is much more to it than that,
though. There is something of a need in the reporter, as well as his
personal interest and involvement here. It may be the case that the war
reporter -- and especially the BBC employee -- is meant to remain
uninvolved, but that is not good enough for Bell.
''You are sent to be very dispassionate and detached and not involved
but it's not possible to be 'not involved' when you're close to so much
suffering.'' Is he religious? ''I have strong religious feelings which
are a bit unfocused at the moment because of my experiences. I have a
great deal of difficulty in reconciling a belief in a benevolent deity
with what I see around me, the death and misery on an epic scale. All
wise, all good and a touch inattentive . . .''
He does not mean to harp on about it, but his conversation is
understandably full of small references to the ever-present danger, the
terrible things he has seen, ''having gone through so much'' as he says,
casually, in passing.
He values fear; it helps keep him alive. ''I've never been in a war
with so much lead flying through the air, or a war that has gone on for
so long and so much exposes you on an everyday basis to the suffering of
people, or a war in Europe -- being on my continent made a bit of a
difference.''
He talks a great deal about responsibility, personal and moral, and
compares events in Bosnia to a fire in the southern wing of our common
European home. It is the same corner, of course, of the same wing as led
to the 1914 to 1918 war. Should anyone really need a history lesson on
the possible repercussions for us all?
There are the good things that emerge from war: the manifestations of
the indomitable human spirit, bravery, courage, comradeship. Bell is not
ready to give it up yet. He wants to see this one through and, anyway,
he doesn't think he would be much good at retiring. The appeal of an
ordered life, of security, of leaving that life just as you found it, is
limited for him.
He does not reveal much of himself. He is a private man despite our
frank discussion. He is the very opposite of the image of the war
reporter: warm and passionate and concerned and funny; but tough.
As we were talking, someone behind him dropped a large box of
deliveries on the floor with a loud thump. I jumped several inches. He
didn't flinch.

SIR William Fraser, who retired recently as Principal, or chief
executive, of Glasgow University, has been nominated for the post of
Chancellor, or titular head of the institution.
His name has been put forward by Glasgow medical practitioner Dr
Donald McFarlane, and is seconded by Glasgow solicitor Malcolm McIver.
Dr McFarlane said yesterday: ''Sir William has taken the university
forward in a late twentieth century manner. He knows what makes
Government tick, at a time when universities have become much more
Government-dominated.
''The university is a much better place in many ways than it was
before he became Principal.''
Sir William said he had been asked by people inside and outside the
university if he would allow his name to go forward.
''If I am not elected, I shall be neither surprised nor disappointed.
If I were to be elected, it would be an absolutely outstanding honour,''
he said.
The closing date for nominations is November 24. Nominations can be
made by members of the university's General Council, which represents
graduates and staff.
If more than one nomination is received, there will be a postal
election involving council members, with the result being announced in
January.
Sir Alec's successor will be the university's 40th Chancellor. In
1929, Sir Donald MacAlister moved on from being Principal to Chancellor
of the university.

BEETHOVEN composed seven full-length piano trios, all of them
masterpieces, and all being played in Edinburgh by this expert young
London-based ensemble in a cycle of three concerts between now and
February.
Beethoven, too, was young -- even younger -- when he wrote the works
in E flat major, Op 1, No 1, and B flat major, Op 11, that opened
Sunday's programme, but a little of their lightness, charm and shear
mischief seemed missing from the measured, quite serious performances
they received.
Yet there were some lovely moments, the romance of the B flat trios
adagio being caught by the cellist Robert Max with just the right sudden
deepening of emotion the music needed. Rightly to, Beethoven's
emancipation of the cello was treated even in these early works, as one
of his big contributions to the art of the piano trio.
Another was his sense of drama, which swept through the performance of
the Ghost trio, Op 70, No 1. Like a natural force, without any need to
make the slow movement sound more spectral than it actually is.
But though this formed the concert's climax, it did not sweep aside
the gentle little unnumbered trio movement which preceded it in this
concert, and whose flow and innocence were conveyed to admiration. These
are performers, who, until now have been devoting much attention to the
peripheries of the repertoire, but who clearly have something to say
about Beethoven.

A SENIOR social worker at the centre of racial hate allegations has
denied conducting a one-woman campaign against the Asian owners of the
old people's home she helped to close.
An appeal tribunal at Paisley Sheriff Court earlier heard claims that
Strathclyde social worker Mrs Davina Young was ''power crazy'' and waged
a relentless war against Dr Sohail Chaudhry after he had opened his
Caldwell House residential home for the elderly near Lugton, in
Renfrewshire.
As the appeal against Strathclyde Regional Council's cancellation of
registration resumed yesterday, Mrs Young claimed she and her colleagues
had done everything possible to try to assist as the establishment
''lurched from one crisis to another''.
Following the first annual inspection of the premises in April 1992, a
report outlined a list of almost 30 unsatisfactory findings, said Mrs
Young. Yet, throughout that year, there was little effort made to
introduce improvements.
By 1993, it became obvious that the operation was struggling for its
financial survival and she and her staff mounted a concerted effort to
try to help keep the business going.
She said Dr Chaudhry became bitter and at one meeting made allegations
about her personal contribution.
''He implied there had been racism involved and I became a bit
distressed,'' she added.
Just weeks before the decision was made to move for withdrawal of the
registration, staffing levels had fallen, hygiene and health and safety
issues were causing anxiety, the premises were suffering from neglect,
and the general environment was deteriorating to unacceptable levels,
she said.
The tribunal continues.

SCOTLAND is near the top of the table for ''poverty pay'', with some
jobs paying less than #3 an hour, Labour MP Robin Cook claimed
yesterday, writes Alan Hunter.
Commenting on a survey in his Livingston constituency, Mr Cook said
the figures strengthened the case for his party's commitment to a
minimum wage.
He visited a JobCentre in the town to inspect statistics which, he
said, proved that people were being forced to accept financial pressures
as a result of low wage levels.
He quoted examples which showed security officers on #2.20p an hour,
an experienced butcher on #2.85p an hour, and bar stewards on #3.01p an
hour.

And the German lesson is . . . that investment in vocational training
is well worth the money, trouble, and risk
THROUGH its blueprint for the upper secondary school -- ''Higher
Still'' -- the Scottish Office hopes to achieve equal esteem for
academic and vocational awards. The lesson from Germany is that it can
be done.
Hermann Schmidt and Laszlo Alex, of the Federal Institute for
Vocational Training in Germany, explain that vocational qualifications
confer high standing. It is recognised that the country can only succeed
internationally with a competent workforce. Over 80% of employees hold
vocational or professional qualifications. By 2010, the figure will rise
to 90%.
Young people take vocational education till the age of 18. They embark
on upper secondary education at 15, usually through the Gymnasium
(equivalent to an English grammar school), or the Dual System which
prepares them for specific occupations by combining employer training
with part-time education at Berufsschulen (vocational schools).
Youngsters often follow more than one route to improve their
competence. Many trainees in technical, commercial and craft occupations
first obtain the Abitur (equivalent to English A Levels). In the 1960s
the figure was 3%, today it is 15%.
Employers and trade unions agree standards and content of training,
which are then legally codified to ensure uniformity across the country.
The Berufsschulen work with companies to provide three-year programmes
of education and training. Weekly release from the company is legally
fixed at 12 hours. Each Land (region) pays for this FE component, which
comprises general education (languages, politics, sport, religion) plus
understanding of the theoretical basis of the occupation. The cost of
practical training is borne by companies.
Employers and unions place the ability to act independently at the
heart of training programmes. Trainees learn to plan, carry out and
manage their own work tasks. They are also taught to work and
communicate effectively in teams.
Public investment in the Dual System is high. It covers training in
areas of national interest, research, training subsidies and incentive
grants for innovation, with trainees receiving allowances negotiated in
each industrial sector.
Despite the training costs, there is a positive balance to the
employer through the trainee's contribution to the business and savings
from not recruiting an adult worker.
There may be lessons we can learn from this. British training
experience could be harnessed to construct a national system of
vocational education and training, incorporating, perhaps, the new
''modern apprenticeship'' initiative. These elements of the German
approach could be included:
* In the workplace, young people should undertake both learning and
work, with early responsibility acting as a motivator.
* The employer would pay for in-company training, deriving benefit
from the long-term development of qualified employees.
* The Government would provide part-time further education, designed
to offer transferable skills and knowledge in a mobile labour market.
This will only work if British employers are committed to long-term
investment in human capital. Instead, many employers -- especially in
small enterprises -- are concerned that workers whose training they
subsidise may move on.
However, management concepts like ''lean'' working and total quality
cannot be implemented with an unqualified workforce. If we want to
emulate the German example, we must become investors in people.

A WARNING that dairy farmers should be careful not to destroy the milk
co-operative buying system was issued yesterday by John Don, president
of the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society.
Speaking at the society's annual general meeting in Dunblane, he said
the entry of milk into the co-operative sector, in the wake of
deregulation, had helped to push the co-operative sector share of farm
output up to 30%.
Ed Rainey Brown, the SAOS chief executive, supported the president's
call for farmers to remain loyal to the milk co-operatives -- the
largest of which is Scottish Milk.
Private milk buyers who were currently offering a higher price at farm
level were doing so for only one reason, he said -- ''because in the
long term they want to pay less''.
Mr Don said that the absorption of milk into the co-operative sector
had put Scottish co-operative activity into a very respectable position
on the European league table.
However, Scotland still had only 1% of European agricultural
production which meant producers had to combine to meet the demands of
multiple retailers. ''These demands are increasing and we cannot meet
them as individuals,'' he said. ''To produce significant volume we have
to form marketing groups.''
Mr Don said he had personally benefited from being a member of a
vegetable co-op. While the profile of co-ops had been raised
considerably in Scotland there was still a long way to go. SAOS, as the
umbrella organisation, would continue to work for the sector especially
in drawing up business plans.
He welcomed recent moves which had brought the society closer to the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland and created more opportunities to
get the co-operation message over to farmers.
There were people in the NFUS who were now saying the union had to
move on from the political agenda to paying more attention to marketing
opportunities if the membership was going to survive, he said.
Patrick Moore, chief operations officer of the Irish Food Board, said
the process of reduction in European Union supports had forced Ireland's
processors to focus on their level of competitiveness earlier than had
been the case for many other EU members.
There had been considerable consolidation within both the beef and
dairy industries -- the largest components of the Irish food sector, he
said. While output had grown, overall numbers employed in food and
agriculture had continued to fall in the drive for greater efficiency.
''We remain under no illusions -- the next 10 years and more will be
an era of constant change for food companies everywhere,'' he said. ''At
the end of the day those companies who prove themselves to have the
necessary degrees of competitiveness and flexibility will be the ones
that will succeed.''
Anders Haggstrom, director of international development with the
Federation of Swedish Farmers, said in Sweden farmers were well
organised and aware they had to act together to be successful on the
market. The co-operatives and the union were combined in the federation
which acted as an umbrella body.
The average Swedish full-time farmer belonged to about five
co-operatives, and the dairy industry was dominated by co-ops which were
responsible for 99% of milk deliveries, he added.

AT its best this year's RGI show allows us to see all types of work by
local heroes; Dorrian's exquisite fluent pencil drawing hangs beside
Thomson's powerful, coarse and rough iconic head. At its worst, the RGI
can be so predictable that it's impossible to stifle a yawn. One longs
for the many cosy, tasteful artists who paint saleable, easy pictures to
do something -- anything -- that involves a risk.
However this year's prizes give hope. I was glad to see 1994 Aberdeen
graduate Karen McPherson win the Cuthbert Award for a bright abstract
full of gestural joie de vie. Oliver Marsden, who graduated the same
year from Edinburgh, took the Arthur Anderson Prize. Many big, bold,
boring abstracts also won prizes. Did the judges think they were being
adventurous? If so, they are mistaken. Sculpture prizes went to Glasgow
student Elpida Vasileva for her impressive woven wicker bird strangely
titled Mother and her Child; Richard Brown, who shows at Art Exposure,
must be happy with his share of the Macfarlane Award for a gentle linear
figurative sandstone carving, while Anne Bevan's brave concrete pillows
won the Schotz award.
Some awards do go to pretty average work -- but judges can only select
from what's available. More young artists should enter rather that turn
their noses up at the RGI. Surely #1000 comes in handy whatever the
source? If I'd been awarding prizes somewhere in there would be a
selection of the following: Cosgrove's ambitious Measure of Sand;
Butler's divine Sunworshippers, Murray's fabulous pool, its red and pink
flecks in among the watery depths reminiscent of Matisse's Goldfish;
McInnes's Journey; Pattison's Cameos, any of Kynoch's excellent
portaits, and McNicol's Hatrack Building.
The RGI does showcase the big boys -- and girls -- too. Don't miss
Crosbie's yellow nudes, Robertson's smouldering Summer Incident,
Blackadder's wonderful Kimono, Wyllie's straw joke, McArthur's very fine
Red Pears, and Wilson's delicious Pink Portrait. Goudie makes a
considerable impact with his outrageous, extravagant self portrait with
poppies.
A complaint. The sparse hang limits numbers to a mere 300 exhibits.
What about a more rumbustious, raggle taggle, relaxed affair next time?

Will slick propaganda be enough to stem the tide against Shell in
Nigeria? MARGARET VAUGHAN thinks not
SHELL insists it has no intention of pulling out of Nigeria, despite
threats of a consumer boycott and intensive protests on an international
scale.
The oil giant says it has a major commitment to the people of Nigeria
but it cannot become involved in the politics of countries in which it
operates. Odd, then, that it was discussing tactics for countering
protests over the case of Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni people at a
meeting with senior Nigerian officials in London in March.
Documents of the meeting at the Shell Centre in London, which have
been passed to The Herald, disclose that Nigeria's High Commissioner,
Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, asked Shell for help to counter ''false
allegations peddled against Nigeria and Shell over Ogoni and Ken
Saro-Wiwa''.
The notes show that the midday meeting on March 16 was attended by
four senior Shell executives, including the head of regional liaison,
the group public affairs co-ordinator, the regional co-ordinator of the
Western Hemisphere and African regional organisation, and the area
co-ordinator for Nigeria and Angola.
The Nigerian delegation included the High Commissioner; an army
colonel, D P Iketubosin; and a police, or political, counsellor, Mr S A
Ekpa. They record that the High Commissioner expressed dismay at the
apparent ''network of misinformation'' orchestrated by Gordon and Anita
Roddick of the Body Shop against Nigeria over the trial of Ken
Saro-Wiwa. He called on Shell to ''debunk'' the allegations.
Shell's head of regional liaison, Malcolm Williams, is noted as
explaining that Anita Roddick was said to be a very close friend of Ken
Saro-Wiwa. The Shell executives said that groups involved in a protest
campaign savoured publicity, were well co-ordinated, recruiting and
training activists to carry out their campaigns.
''At this point His Excellency the High Commissioner wanted to know
what could be done to counteract the poor media campaign.''
Williams was wary of any approach that ''will play into the hand of
the propagandists'', the notes state: ''He was of the view that a direct
attack on the groups concerned will bring the matter much more into the
public domain, which is what they want.''
Shell planned to embark on a film of its Nigerian operation which
aimed to ''balance facts''. The High Commissioner was ''very delighted''
and promised to assist Shell overcome any ''bureaucractic problems''
they might encounter in producing the film.
It seemed clear yesterday that Shell, involved in almost half of
Nigeria's oil production, is intent on resisting pressure from
protestors for an oil embargo against the military regime which executed
Saro-Wiwa and eight other campaigners for the rights of the
500,000-strong Ogoni minority.
Indeed, a spokesman explained that reports that it had delayed a
decision on signing a #2.5 billion gas deal with a company in which it
has a 24% stake, were wrong.
The Prime Minister had signalled that the Government might apply
pressure for the deal to be dropped, because of concern that the gas
plant would prop up the military regime. But Shell's spokesman said the
question of whether to go ahead with the investment would be on the
agenda of Wednesday's board meeting of Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas
Ltd:
''Anyway we must remember that with a project like this, you're
talking about something that will benefit the long-term future of
Nigeria. There will be no revenues to any of the shareholders, including
the Nigerian Government until the early part of the next century.''
Saro-Wiwa was quoted as saying before his death: ''Nigerian oil is
what sustains the Nigerian military dictators, enabling them to
survive.''
Observers agree that there are only two things that could have an
immediate impact on Nigeria's ruling despots. One would be freezing the
military clique's overseas bank accounts, probably an impossibly complex
option. The second would involve depriving them of the oil revenues that
they steal. John Major's fears that Nigeria's poor would be hurt by oil
sanctions seem misplaced in the light of a Nigerian Government
commission report which revealed that under a previous regime some $12
billion in oil revenues were unaccounted for.
The economy has been in a shambles for a long time with benefits from
oil revenues, which make up 90% of foreign exchange earnings, hardly
reaching beleaguered tribal communities. The loss of oil money would be
most felt in the generals' pockets.
There are, however, a number of simple but profound reasons why Shell
is likely to refuse to bow to international pressure and repugnance at
its dealing with Nigeria's military dictators, and they are all
commercial.
Shell is by far the biggest oil producer operating in Nigeria. Its
production at 900,000 barrels a day dwarves that of its competitors. It
has a 30% stake in the Nigerian state oil company, so its economic
interest is worth roughly 270,000 barrels a day. This amounts to 13.7%
of the oil giant's total worldwide production.
Secondly, despite international calls from protestors for Shell to
pull out, it hasn't been matched by pressure from politicians. The US,
Britain, and other Western European countries may be happy to ban arms
sales but are reluctant to halt oil exports.
Britain has #3.4 billion invested in Nigeria. The US is the biggest
importer of Nigerian oil, taking around half of its daily ouput. It may
be that an oil embargo would be a sanction too far for governments whose
economic interests lie in keeping the oil flowing.
Those amoral arbiters, oil analysts, were taking a sanguine view of
the call for sanctions yesterday. Traders and analysts said oil prices
hadn't reacted to the mounting international pressure for an oil ban.
Oil analyst Geoff Pyne, of the investment bank UBS, said Nigeria is
one of the largest producers in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, and a major supplier of high-quality light sweet crude oil to
the US and Western Europe.
And while John Major was insisting oil sanctions would hurt ordinary
Nigerians, a White House official said Washington was not considering an
oil embargo. A ban by the United Nations similar to the one imposed on
Iraq was not possible, said Pyne since Nigeria's situation did not
''pose a threat to international peace and stability'' as is required by
the UN before it imposes sanctions.
Lastly, Shell is still smarting from the public relations fiasco
surrounding the Brent Spar. Mindful of the political drubbing it took
when consumer boycotts and Greenpeace activists forced it to drop plans
to dump the Brent Spar in the North Sea, it is likely to more chary of
caving in this time.

THE special relationship between Britain and the United States has a
vital role to perform in world affairs, it was claimed last night in
Edinburgh.
Delivering the latest in the series of Lothian European Lectures, Sir
Robin Renwick, the former British Ambassador to the United States, said
it was of the utmost importance that the US should not be left alone to
deal with major crises which affect European interests as much as those
of its own.
He suggested that most people in Britain would continue to regard the
US as its most dependable ally.
Looking to the future, he felt there were ways in which Britain could
continue to provide a service to the transatlantic relationship.
One was by continuing to bind together the US and Europe, something
especially necessary today. ''Unless Britain plays an active role in
Europe, its influence will be diminished in Washington, and vice
versa,'' he said.

Alan MacDermid, Medical Correspondent, examines the party drug taken
to create a sense of euphoria but increasingly with tragic consequences
EXHAUSTION and heatstroke are nature's ways of telling you to sit down
and have a long cool drink. Ecstasy tells you that nature is bunk and
that you can leap up and down all night.
It may work for most people most of the time, but every so often a
tragedy like that of Leah Betts, who has been in a coma since taking the
drug at her 18th birthday party at the weekend, brings us up short.
Surviving ecstasy may depend on how quickly your body can metabolise
the drug and get rid of it from your system, but according to Heather
Ashton, professor of psycho-pharmacology at Newcastle University,
between five and ten per cent of the population are slow metabolisers
and particularly at risk from long-term effects.
This can include blood clotting, possibly related to dehydration --
the result of jumping up and down all night at raves -- which can result
in kidney failure.
Convulsions and hyperthermia, psychotic reactions, hallucinations are
also hazards and Professor Ashton says: ''It can probably cause
permanent brain damage, and there are cases of long-lasting psychotic
reactions.''
Ecstasy, or methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA)is a synthetic drug
based on amphetamine and has effects like amphetamine and LSD.
What exactly does it do to your head? Biochemist Dr Marcus Rattray, in
a report from the UK Medical Research Council, says the evidence points
to its effect on serotonin, or 5HT, one of the key neurotransmitters
which facilitate the passing of messages between brain cells, and which
greatly influences mood.
Drugs like Prozac, prescribed to treat depression, work by hampering
the re-absorption of serotonin once it is produced, but MDMA goes
further -- it stimulates the release of serotonin, inhibits its
synthesis, and then also blocks its re-uptake into the nerve terminals.
However, he says, it is likely that it sets off a chain reaction,
resulting in irreversible nerve terminal damage, which may lead to
long-term neuropsychiatric illnesses.''
Professor Ashton said: ''It affects the chemicals in the brain, and in
particular serotonin, but it has effects all over the body. Because it
is a stimulant it keeps people awake and gives them lots of energy. But
it also speeds up the heart beat, and you can get an abnormal rhythm.
''It stimulates the muscles, and you get an effect similar to that
sometimes suffered by marathon runners, where after a time you start
eating up your own muscles.''
To a teenager at a rave it might seem far-fetched that something
looking like a vitamin tablet could kill them. To start with, it makes
people feel good and well-disposed towards each other (it was,
apparently, used at one time to help couples with marital problems).
There have been reports of former football hooligans, part of the
distribution network, greeting each other like old friends at matches
instead of trying to maim each other.
The history of ecstasy goes back some 80 years -- ''It was used as an
agent for psycho-analysis -- freeing up your brain -- but it was proved
to be of no use and it was banned in America in the 1980s. It has been
proved not be therapeutically useful,'' said Professor Ashton.
Leah Betts's story is only the latest in a series of tragedies
involving the drug. Professor Ashton said: ''There have been a couple of
cases recently reported of two 17-year-old girls who took ecstasy and
went into a coma.''
Add to that the fact that ecstasy tablets are liable to be mixed with
impurities -- other amphetamines, baking soda, or bleach. Anyone with
some reasonable scientific knowledge could make it in their cellar with
some amphetamine and a few other chemicals, and many clearly do -- with
all the care, purity and quality control that you would expect from
bathtub gin.

EXCLUSIVE
THE captain of the vessel which was involved in the death of two
Aberdeen District Council officials during an official visit to the
former Soviet state of Belarus will go on trial next week.
Councillor Margaret Smith, who was on the visit to Aberdeen's twin
city Gomel in June, is to leave this weekend to attend the trial and may
be called to give evidence for either prosecution or defence.
She will be accompanied by the city's international officer, Ms Alison
Cameron, who speaks Russian.
Ms Ann Hughes, the council's deputy chief executive, and Mr Iain
McDonald, the principal environmental health officer, died after being
on a cruise. They were part of the team looking at ways of helping Gomel
with its environmental problems.
The captain has been charged under Belarus's Infringement of Traffic
Regulations.

THE health of babies whose mothers struggled to exist on benefits
during pregnancy is being put at serious risk as a consequence of
poverty and poor diet, it has been claimed.
A report published yesterday by the charities NCH Action for Children
and the Maternity Alliance says it is virtually impossible for young
pregnant women living on income support to eat an adequate diet.
While a national study found that nearly a third of pregnant women on
income support were seriously deficient in vital nutrients, a study
conducted in Scotland revealed that:
* One quarter of underweight babies suffer some sort of disability.
* One third of very underweight babies do not live past five years
old.
* Nearly one fifth suffered from celebral palsy, blindness, or
deafness.
The report says there is a direct link between poverty, diet, and
childrens' health and wants the Department of Social Security to pay a
''pregnancy premium'' when a pregnancy is confirmed.
They also say that, over the past 30 years, the number of underweight
babies has not fallen in spite of a greater awareness of nutrition.
Across the UK, the figure stands at 7% of babies, a higher figure than
in the majority of European countries. Meanwhile, the number of mothers
on means-tested benefits had risen from one-in-five seven years ago to
one-in-three.
NCH Action for Children's Scottish spokeswoman, Ms Liz Watson, said
that for those struggling to juggle food, fuel, and clothing bills, many
found it cheaper to skip meals and opt for sugary, fatty foods rather
than more expensive fruits, fish, fresh meat, and vegetables. On
average, women on income support spent #10 a week on food while the
average is around #20. A healthy diet is estimated to cost around #18 a
week.
The report's findings came as little surprise to single
mother-of-three Jackie Fisher. The 29-year-old lives in Stirling's
Raploch estate on benefits totalling #127 a week.
She said she had been given no advice on diet during any of her
pregnancies and, with a number of other problems to contend with, never
gave the matter a great deal of thought. ''I put in for milk tokens
straight away but it was impossible to eat things like fresh vegetables.
They are just too expensive.''
Ms Fisher said that, in spite of her sometimes inadequate diet, none
of her three children were born underweight but she says her children
are often unwell. Her youngest, aged two, suffers from asthma and her
eldest daughter, aged six, from bouts of croup during the winter.
She said she was concerned about trying to feed her children properly
on income support. Shopping involves scanning supermarket shelves for
cheap own brands and choosing cheaper, bulkier foods over healthier
foods.

There were many stormy scenes in the life of Sir Robert Stephens who
died at the weekend. But there were also many great performances, and
even one with the Prince of Wales, remembers William Russell
WINE, women, song, and some wonderful performances, as well as a few
best forgotten, marked Robert Stephens' see-saw career as an actor and
his life as a man.
More recently, his career had taken a dramatic upswing and before his
death on Sunday, 64-year-old Sir Robert was visited by the Prince of
Wales. The Prince was one of the last visitors to see Sir Robert alive.
The two had struck up a friendship in 1993 due initially to their
shared love of Shakespeare. Sir Robert was executive producer of The
Prince's Choice, a series of new recordings in which the Prince selected
his favourite Shakespearean speeches.
Along with his son Toby and the Prince -- as Prince Hal -- Sir Robert
recorded a scene from Henry IV Part One with Sir Robert as Falstaff. Of
his last work, partly recorded at Highgrove, the Prince's
Gloucestershire home, Sir Robert said: ''I suppose that our greatest
delight has been to persuade Prince Charles to play Hal to my
Falstaff.''
Sir Robert met the Prince after the actor gave a performance as
Falstaff at a Buckingham Palace reception. The Prince later visited Sir
Robert in hospital when he suffered a severe foot infection in May 1993,
when he was appearing as King Lear with the Royal Shakespeare Company in
Stratford, and later watched one of his performances.
Sir Robert was impressive on stage but his personal life was as
dramatic as any part he played. Colourful and unashamedly libidinous,
women found him irresistible. His life was one long succession of broken
hearts, discarded mistresses, one-night stands, and former wives. He
revealed all in his autobiography, Knight Errant, a book so frank about
his sexual conquests some consider it the work of a cad.
Stephens was unrepentant. Women had written so much about their
affairs in kiss-and-tell books it was time men turned the tables, he
said. But in any case, he was never a gentleman in the social sense. He
was an actor, a true vagabond, a man who lived for the moment, whose
passions were extreme.
He could, as some critics suggested, have simply been spicing up the
book to make it sell, but the reality seems that he believed, if he
wanted to share his career as a Casanova with the world, it was his
business. Certainly the book does not detract from the image of a man
blessed with an engaging, entertaining and larger than life personality;
a man unique in being a hell raiser who went to Hell -- and came back.
Robert Stephens was arguably the finest male actor of his generation
for whom at one point all things seemed possible. When he was married to
Maggie Smith they were the golden theatrical couple of the day. The
marriage ended after eight years. By then, his once handsome features
were ravaged by drink, and he was reduced to appearing in supporting
roles in poor films. Then suddenly, four years ago, the roue reformed, a
great star actor was reborn.
His performances in the 1991-92 Stratford season as Falstaff in Henry
IV, Parts One and Two, proved the turning point. He was judged best
actor in the 1992 Olivier Awards, and in 1993 his Lear was equally
memorable. When he was knighted last March it was an accolade deserved.
Just two months earlier he married for the fourth time. His bride was
the actress Patricia Quinn, his companion for 20 tempestuous years. But
his lifestyle had taken its toll. Last October he had a liver and kidney
transplant operation, but even in hospital he remained an unrepentant
hedonist, giving interviews and holding court.
Never conventionally handsome, he undoubtedly had sex appeal. He had
affairs with Margaret Leighton, 11 years his senior, with Lady Antonia
Fraser, while she was still married to Sir Hugh Fraser, with the actress
Judith Stott, former wife of the comedian Dave Allen, and the actress
Tammy Grimes, who was married at the time to Christopher Plummer.
Not that he fell for every woman. He ran a mile when Marlene Dietrich
made clear she fancied him. She told him he was ''a very silly young
man.'' Later he agreed. Nor were his conquests all famous. John
Mortimer, in whose play, The Wrong Side of the Park, Stephens starred,
learned from Knight Errant that the actor had enjoyed a wonderful time
with their dentist's receptionist, one ''Carmen Rollers.''
During the early 1970s he had a steamy affair with a television
make-up girl called Daphne, and while married to Maggie Smith with their
secretary, Sheila Pickles.
Robert Stephens, born in Bristol, son of a labourer and a chocolate
packer, appears to have had a miserable childhood. His mother once
confessed she had tried to abort him with a crochet hook. He discovered
he could act at a local boy's club and left home aged 17 to attend drama
school in Bradford. There he met his first wife, Nora Simmonds. They
married two years later and had a son, Michael Christopher, after which
Nora went home to Londonderry.
Stephens met his second wife, the actress Tarn Basset, in 1953 while
touring in a play called Not A Clue, and they married in April 1956. It
lasted 11 years, during which, after the usual hardships in repertory,
he enjoyed his first success in John Osborne's An Epitaph for George
Dillon at the Royal Court. But that success brought disaster.
The production moved to New York and Stephens, earning 600 dollars a
week, found himself on the loose in a city of pleasures. Even the birth
of their daughter, Lucy, did not end his philandering. Basset, however,
put up with it all until he met Maggie Smith, or ''Madame Schmidt'' as
she named her, when he joined Olivier's newly reformed National Theatre
company.
In 1964 he starred to great acclaim as Atahaulpa the Inca king, in
Peter Shaffer's Royal Hunt of the Sun. Towards the end of 1966 Maggie
Smith became pregnant and Tarn decided enough was enough. He married
Maggie Smith the following year and they had two sons, of whom the
younger, Toby Stephens, is one of the RSC's leading men.
The marriage, fuelled on pills, booze and nervous tension, was
tumultuous, not helped by the fact that Olivier, who had made him an
associated director of the National Theatre, resented his protege.
In 1971 he and Maggie Smith starred in Private Lives in the West End,
hoping in vain working together might save their marriage. Smith, whose
performance was savagely attacked by the critics, took the huff, and
left Britain to work at Stratford, Ontario, taking their sons
Christopher and Toby with her. Stephens took refuge in drink.
In 1975 he met Patricia Quinn. It was a turbulent relationship, but it
endured.
''I have been fortunate and I have been fulfilled,'' he wrote. ''Think
of me as a tree that has nearly been axed through but the sap has found
a way to work its way up. The tree, miraculously, still stands.''
On Sunday that tree, its roots damaged by years of dissipation,
finally fell, but it was a glorious tree.

POLICE yesterday appealed for witnesses to a three-vehicle road
accident on the A77, the main Glasgow to Ayrshire road link, in which
one man died and two other people were injured.
The accident happened on a stretch of the road near Fenwick which has
four lanes but no central reservation.
Previous accidents on the A77 have prompted calls by Ayrshire MPs for
its upgrading to motorway.
Mr Colin McGougan, 31, of Raithburn Avenue, Kilmarnock, was travelling
south at about 7.55am yesterday when he appeared to lose control of his
Ford Capri, crossing the north-bound carriageway before colliding
head-on with a Nissan Primera, which spun round and collided with a
Rover. Mr McGougan died later from his injuries.
The Nissan's driver, Mr Gordon Shank, 25, of Kerse Gardens, Falkirk,
was detained in Crosshouse Hospital with serious injuries. The Rover's
driver, Ms Rosemary Ann Garside, 49, of Forrest Grove, Kilmarnock, was
allowed home after treatment for facial injuries.
Police inquiries are continuing and a report will be submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.
A second accident at the same time involving a lorry which had stopped
on the north-bound carriageway and another vehicle is being investigated
separately. There was no serious injury.
In March, Labour MPs George Foulkes and Brian Donohoe called for an
urgent upgrading of the A77 between Malletsheugh and Fenwick after four
people died in a head-on crash near Newton Mearns.
That accident brought the total killed on the A77 to 43 in the
previous five years. They include some of the most horrific crashes that
emergency services have had to deal with in Scotland.
Three men in a stolen car died in September last year when it collided
head-on with a Jaguar car driven by Lord Weir.
This January, a 50-year-old woman died after she dashed on to the A77
Ayr by-pass to tend her dying 18-year-old son who had been struck by a
car.
Scottish Office figures released in March showed that the annual toll
on the A77 peaked in 1991 when there were 12 deaths.

LABOUR is considering plans to send mothers and fathers of young
offenders to compulsory parenting classes.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said yesterday that proposals to
introduce the Parental Training Order may be in Labour's election
manifesto. The policy is aimed at cracking down on persistent young
offenders.
In extreme cases, the courts would make an order for their parents to
attend classes which would be supervised by the probation service.
Mr Straw said the measure was used in the American state of Virginia
and had met with some success, although it was not a miracle cure.
''What we have to do is break this cycle where bad parenting is
transmitted from generation to generation,'' Mr Straw said.
''I've met plenty of parents who simply don't know what to do next,
who are at their wits' end, who will find themselves being harsh on the
one hand and indulgent on the other. That's where I think they need a
bit of education,'' he said on BBC Radio 4.
''Children, as the rest of us, need to know where the boundaries are,
what the limits are.''
Mr Straw said the classes would be just part of an overall plan to
make parenting a public rather than a private issue.
''We live in a very odd society where, open any newspaper, there is
reams of advice about sexual relations -- that's now a public issue.
''There is virtually none about being a parent and the harder it gets
the less advice there is,'' he said.
Labour also would introduce parenting as a topic in schools' personal
social education lessons.

TEXEL breeders from all over Britain were in Peebles celebrating the
twenty-first anniversary of the breed's first importation from France
and Holland.
Since then the breed has won many championships at shows such as
Smithfield and the Winter Fair. However, breeders were warned that the
show ring was not necessarily the route to commercial success.
Calling on his experience of a trip to New Zealand, Dr Dewi Jones of
the University of Wales claimed that since the first Texels entered that
country in 1991 sheep farmers had concentrated on truly commercial
characters.
Dr Jones said: ''The New Zealand approach is quite different and
geared totally towards commercial returns. It's easy here to buy a
well-fed ram but New Zealand breeders are producing sheep of use to the
commercial farmers. Showing and breed type are of far less importance to
them and the sheep out there are more useful than some in this
country.''
Dr Jones has been working with Texels since 1988 when a flock was
established with selection based solely on growth rate and leanness.
However, he said this had produced a different type of sheep. ''We've
bred a Texel half as big again but in doing this we've let the breed
type slip. This happens if you go after a single trait and we left
confirmation behind.''
A second flock was established with visual appraisal of confirmation
as the criterion. Lambs from the two flocks were slaughtered at the same
weight and it was then discovered that lambs from the high confirmation
flock had a carcase which on average was 0.9kg heavier with 0.5kg more
lean and 14% more eye muscle.
Dr Jones suggested the practical lesson for farmers was that they
should attempt to combine high growth rates with confirmation. He added
that in trials using high index rams, lambs reached slaughter weight 20
days earlier and were 1kg heavier.
Dr Geoff Simm of SAC also stressed that genetics had an important role
to play in producing more profitable sheep. He said: ''Ten years ago the
image of lamb was one of being fat, expensive, inconsistent and
inconvenient. Today we still have many of those problems but the first
two can be tackled through genetics.''
Outlining his work with Suffolks over a nine-year period, Dr Simm said
he had managed to up liveweight by 10%, muscle by 13% and to reduce fat
by 13%.
However, he was less sure about the commercial worth of improved
confirmation. He said: ''There's a huge controversy on this subject and
trials have not shown significant benefits in meat yield and high
confirmation animals are almost inevitably fat ones.''

LESS than 13 months after announcing the creation of a new silicon
wafer facility, officials at Motorola in East Kilbride formally opened
the new #250m plant yesterday.
Among those attending was President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang.
After the ceremony, a six-person team from the plant presented him with
the first silicon wafer produced there.
Mr Lang said the opening was particularly significant because it was
the first time the US-based company had launched a major new venture
outside the US. ''This strengthens the important contribution Motorola
makes not only to the Scottish economy, but to the British economy as a
whole,'' he said.
Mr Lang also announced that Motorola plans to open a #1m research and
design centre for the development of new applications for the
microprocessors found in smart cards. The plant will be located in the
Scottish Enterprise Technology Park in East Kilbride.
''History, I'm glad to say, is about to repeat itself,'' he said.
''(The site) was chosen in preference to other sites in the United
States and Asia. It is one immediate, and very tangible benefit, of the
company's decision to make Scotland its worldwide headquarters for smart
card technology.''
The centre will initially employ 10 electronics engineers with the
potential to create more jobs, Mr Lang added.
Tommy George, president of Motorola's worldwide semiconductor
business, said East Kilbride's location was one of the primary reasons
the Scottish site was selected instead of the US or Asia. ''The use of
smart cards first started here in Europe,'' he said, ''so it made sense
that this was a good place to locate.''
Mr George added that use of the credit-card sized devices, which can
be employed for everything from simple bank transactions to the storage
of medical records, would certainly expand to other regions of the
world.
Because the silicon production plant was built and put into operation
so quickly, the time scale of expendeture on the project has been
compressed from three to two years. George Bennett, corporate
vice-president of Motorola (Scotland), said it would allow the East
Kilbride facility to double its current production of smart cards.

Glasgow 21, Griqualand West 7.
AS usual, the pre-match entertainment was exquisite. ''Muff'' Scobbie
told the assembled throng that Stirling County have now called off their
Sunday game against Heriot's because of Messrs Manson, Jardine, and
Logan's involvement higher up the previous day.
The Griqualand boys countered with the news that Christian Stewart,
Tiaan Strauss, and former Watsonian Andrew Aitken, have all now signed
for Rugby League.
Five hundred Glasgow schoolboys had been invited free of charge, so we
had ''open your eyes ref,'' and ''a fight -- I'll gie haunders'' in
Glasgow technicolour at Hughenden. It was marvellous.
Griqualand West are not one of South Africa's top provinces, no matter
that 10 of their best players elected not to travel. They had lost all
of their games prior to their encounter with Glasgow, and they never
looked like beating the city side on a night far removed from the
rock-hard pitches close to the precipitous of the Kimberley diamond
mine.
Perhaps five games in 16 days had taken their toll. More likely, a
lively Glasgow side were just too hot to handle on a night hardly
designed for glorious rugby.
Torquil Mathewson -- his dad's signature is on the banknotes -- took
this game by the scruff of the neck on the right wing and looked a
dynamic prospect; Calum MacGregor exerted control inside a disappointing
centre partnership; and Craig Sangster, the Stirling youngster, again
appeared sure-footed in the mud.
More damage was done up front, though. The two Gordons, McIlwham and
Bulloch, were rollicking in their attacks, and the Wallace brothers,
Fergus and Murray, still have far too much class for lesser opponents.
It was 11-0 to Glasgow at half-time, the forwards delighting in their
rucking game, and Kevin Greene's back division swooping like vultures on
the scraps that had been laid back. Fraser Stott snaffled one such
crumb, and pierced an open blind side to post Glasgow's first points.
Calum MacGregor gathered the remainder with two well struck penalties,
and considering that Glasgow had lost the ball once over Griqualand's
line, there was plenty for the young followers of rugby to cheer to the
rooftops.
Continuity rugby from the Glasgow eight was good, let down by one ruck
too many and some poor technique when push came to shove and the backs
needed the final piece of the jigsaw.
After the restart, Griqualand scrum-half Leon Oosthuizen was credited
with the score as his pack drove Glasgow's disintegrating eight over the
line for a highly unexpected pushover try. With the conversion sailing
through, the margin was back to four points.
That plainly upset Murray Wallace as first he gratefully accepted
Gordon McIlwham's tap penalty to blast through for his first try.
Minutes later his brother Fergus, who really is coming back to form,
snatched a pass majestically off his bootlaces, ran and fed Craig
Sangster, whose inside feed found Murray Wallace in hot pursuit, and
nothing was going to stop him reaching the line.
''I was delighted at the way we played,'' said captain Fergus. ''Maybe
we were too loose, maybe neither team really mastered the conditions,
but there were a lot of guys out there who tried hard to give us the
win. And that's what's important.''
Too right, Fergus, and it was good to see a game of rugby when both
teams tried to play an open style. Good signs for Glasgow's future, but
more control needed.

WHILE textile giants like Pringle are cutting back in the face of
cheap Far Eastern competition a 12-month-old Borders firm has signed a
prestige deal to supply top-of-the-range suits and coats to one of
Japan's leading menswear distributors.
The young company, Squire of Galashiels, will be selling its label to
Bus Stop Co. Ltd, the retail arm of Japan's market leader Onward
Kashiyama, whose menswear sales alone are worth #760m a year.
Squire's slice of the action is an annual #1m over an initial two-year
period. It will keep the company's Botany Mill in full production into
1997 and is expected to at last double the workforce of 13.
Beyond that Squire sees even more business with Onward, but managing
director Graham Stoddart is not putting all his eggs into one Japanese
basket. This week he is in Ireland examing market potential with a
Scottish Council Development and Industry trade mission. Next month
Squire opens a second retail store just off London's Bond Street to
subsidise its existing London showroom. The company has also agreed to
open a section in the Vivienne Westwood-Paul Smith shop in Liverpool and
is looking at a possible outlet in Glasgow and expansion into the US
market.
But it is the Japanese deal that has put Squire into the fast track.
With close fitting ''English look'' suits at #600 a throw, the company
is aiming at the well-heeled youngish man in the 25 to 40 age bracket.
''The Onward deal came out of the blue,'' says Graham Stoddart, who
has a background in textiles and public relations. ''One of their senior
staff bought a Squire suit and they approached us. They have never
before signed a deal with a designer-manufacturer and they are taking
all we can produce to our own designs.''
A key ingredient in catching the Japanese eye has been the skill of
the second leading member of the management team, 28-year-old London
based designer Carlo Brandelli. ''He is one of the UK's foremost young
fashion designers and successfully specialises in combining an English
look with Italian flair,'' says Graham. Now that international formula
has hit another rich seam . . . in the deep pockets of the affluent
Japanese male.

SIR Freddie Laker is returning to Prestwick Airport after an absence
of 14 years and is vowing that he is back to stay.
The man who tweaked the noses of the aviation establishment through
the 1980s, and was forced to the wall as that establishment closed ranks
against him, is back with Laker Airways Inc which will fly from
Prestwick, Manchester and Gatwick to Florida.
Sir Freddie has teamed up with US oil magnate Oscar S Wyatt to form
the new airline and a couple of associated travel companies which plan
to offer 14-day holidays in Florida from #399 next summer.
He expressed his delight at returning to the Ayrshire airport, which
has enjoyed record passenger traffic this year, almost 14 years after
the collapse of Skytrain which carried passengers at low prices across
the Atlantic from Prestwick.
Sir Freddie added: ''It will be like coming home and I am really
looking forward to it. It was not a difficult decision to make to return
to Prestwick as I have many happy memories of the airport and I was most
impressed by what I heard from the new management team.
''I was not there for long enough last time but this time I am here to
stay because there will be no big airlines waiting in the wings to try
and force me out of business because they don't like my style or my
prices.''

I RECENTLY crossed words with a Mark Murphy fan who finally demanded:
''Don't you want him to succeed then -- just because you don't like the
film?'' Actually, it's not the film I have a problem with: it's the
dance.
While Murphy has steadily refined his skills as a film-maker, he has
stayed put as a choreographer. No, in fact he has lost ground. Partly
because times have moved on from the giddy, whirling Eurocrash hey-days
of the eighties when to trash each other off every surface was a
blistering metaphor for relationship problems.
Partly because the film, with its swift, well-crafted mix of styles --
the domestic documentary has a naive, home-footage feel while the
movement sequences are angled more inventively -- seems to hold all the
creative energy. It doesn't just over-lay the dance, it eclipses it.
Even when Emma Cater, Christine Devaney and James Hewison are
pistoning through yet another sweat-drenched endurance test there's no
emotional shockwave sparked off by their actions. Certainly nothing that
engages human interest like the shots of Skag the cat caught in a
tug-of-love between James and his departing ex!
But perhaps Murphy wanted his piece to look, and feel, like some
laboratory version of Huis Clos where human behaviour is observed as
impersonally as rats in an experimental trap . . . What emerges from
amid the voice-overs, the filmed flashbacks, the super-imposed
projections in the this latest V-TOL presentation, however, is
choreography that in the end says less to an audience about inner angst
and interpersonal conflicts than Murphy's earliest work when there was
just him, a partner and naught else on stage.

EDINBURGH-based Johnston Press, producer of highly profitable
provincial weekly newspapers, yesterday announced its #20m acquisition
of W&amp;J Linney, subject to consent from the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry.
Linney's newspaper division comprises 11 titles in and around the
Mansfield and Worksop areas. Nine are freesheets and the other two are
paid for. They include the Mansfield Chronicle Advertiser and the
Worksop Guardian.
In the year to March 31, Linney generated a pre-tax profit of #1.015m
on turnover of #8.362m. The company had net tangible assets of #904,000.
Johnston Press has 81 titles, 60 of them in England. The bulk are
concentrated in Yorkshire and Derbyshire.
In August, executive chairman Fred Johnston announced it had reached
record interim pre-tax profits. The end-June figures increased 21.8% to
#8.12m, while turnover was up 11.8% to #49.5m.
Johnston's last major acquisition came in 1994 when it purchased
Halifax Courier Holdings for #29.4m.
Earlier this year there was talk of it acquiring at least part of Reed
Regional Newspapers, the biggest freesheet publisher in Britain, but
nothing came of this.
The Linney titles will become part of Johnston Newspapers (Midlands).
The deal will be satisified in cash.

Pulling all the strings together for the first time, the new unitary
council's director of education is glad to find a strong focus on
schools, reports Dick Louden
THE new unitary authority for Dumbarton, Clydebank and the Vale of
Leven may not yet have decided upon a name for itself, but at least it
has held the inaugural meeting of its education committee.
This took place last week and the strong focus which will be directed
on education was reflected by the inclusion on the committee of the
conveners of all the council's other committees, most of them with no
previous experience of running an education service.
In the eyes of the new director of education, Ian McMurdo -- who took
up post in late August -- ''the meeting went extremely well. The elected
members were very enthusiastic and keen to understand the issues. They
showed a strong commitment to taking the service forward.''
He is in an ideal position to judge the political temperature. From
his post as assistant head teacher at Kilwinning Academy, he was
seconded to act as professional assistant to Councillor Malcolm Green,
the then chairman of Strathclyde region's education committee. It was
the perfect opportunity to come to grips with an enormously complex
education service and the workings of the political machinery, and it
led in due course to an appointment as an education officer in Dunbarton
division.
''This first meeting of the new council was an important day for me,''
he recalls. ''I knew my credibility was on the line. I was delighted
that it went so positively. There were lively discussions on topics like
the careers service and devolved school management.''
Though the new authority does not assume statutory duties until next
April, he is already immersed in a hectic schedule. Such are the
physical upheavals caused by reorganisation that he is operating on his
own from an office in the architect's department in Dumbarton ''full of
boxes and with two chairs''.
He hopes, over the next month or so, to acquire three deputes, to be
called ''service managers''. One will have responsibility for quality
assurance and educational development, the second for planning and
resources, the third for community services and continuing education. In
addition, at least two of the three will be given general oversight of
geographical areas.
Below this second-tier level, there has to be a structure of
supporting posts and at present he is committed to handling staff
transfer orders personally. This is the process by which individual
members of Strathclyde's enormous staff are allocated out to the new
authorities. It is a highly complex process which demands minute
attention, but handling it on its own is the only way in which he can
satisfy himself that adequate staffing and a balance of expertise can be
achieved.
The exercise is throwing up some anomalies. ''In one or two services,
the transfer orders are bringing us more staff than we can really
justify,'' he says, ''but I am negotiating this with other new
councils.'' Likewise, he would hope to remedy any deficits in the same
manner.
The ballot on opting-out which is being organised by parents of
Gateside Primary near Beith in Ayr division brings back memories to Ian
McMurdo, since he was one of the officers involved in local consultation
on earlier proposals to close the school.
The Gateside initiative is motivated by uncertainty about the future
intentions of the new North Ayrshire Council, but he does not believe
any of the schools in his new area is harbouring similar apprehension--
''Our priority is to maintain services at such a level that schools will
continue to enjoy a high degree of confidence when we take over.''
School closures are not at the top of the agenda though -- though he
struck the realistic note in his first committee report that ''the
potential will exist for some rationalisation of services''. He cited as
examples a possible integration of the library services currently
operated by both region and district and the use of leisure centres as
access points for advice on careers.
If integration cannot yet be officially taken forward, cooperation
can. He pays tribute to the support being offered by Strathclyde Region
in its last few months of existence, and points to the partnership which
is being developed with neighbouring councils like East Dunbartonshire
and Argyll and Bute to offer joint arrangements in areas such as the
technician and careers services. Nothing is yet finalised, but his
education committee has agreed that ''proposals can be developed in
principle''.
Uncertainty surrounds the first year's budget, still to be announced
by the Scottish Office. This is ''arguably the bleakest financial
climate which has ever faced local government'' and it is far from
certain that councils will be able to build in adequate funding for
their social strategies to combat disadvantage.
In his own case, he has identified a potential under-provision for
footwear and clothing, and still hopes to compensate for that in his
budget proposals.
Quality will be a strategic principle. ''We are too small to operate a
stand-alone quality assurance unit,'' he says, ''so we shall expect
heads to undertake more self-evaluation at local level, with external
monitoring by my department on a sampling basis. We shall also heighten
the public profile of quality assurance through reports to committee --
sometimes on individual schools -- and close working relationships with
Her Majesty's Inspectorate.''
Ian McMurdo is a highly pragmatic individual for whom realism is
unfailingly the keynote. ''At times like these, it is all down to value
for money,'' he says. ''I genuinely believe that the potential for
corporate working is huge, and that we can break down the barriers
between these areas which have always been regarded as the particular
domain of either the region or the district.''
Communities will be consulted. ''We shall look at their needs with
them, and base the shape of the service on that. We shall attempt to be
self-sufficient but, if it is clear that there will be democratic
benefit to the council in working with others, we shall not hesitate to
follow that route.''

IT'S just after seven on Saturday evening. Anytown, UK. The queue at
the off-licence is stretching out the door, maybe 15 people, hands
clutching identical white slips. Across at the garage the man pays for
his petrol with credit then hands over cash for a ticket and a fistful
of scratch cards. Anthea smooths down her designer jacket and looks at
the clock.
On Saturday night we become a nation possessed, tens of millions of
people transfixed by the tumbling of 49 coloured balls, a ritual so
novel, almost gauche, 12 months ago and now a defining image of British
society.
Like it or loathe it, the National Lottery has been a staggering
success. It's the biggest and most successful one of its kind in the
world, played by almost two-thirds of us every week. We've forked out
#3.3 billion on it -- #280m in Scotland -- and #1.1 billion on the
scratch-card games. We're hooked. Well and truly.
But behind the Big Finger and the champagne photocalls and the 127
shiny new millionaires, there are fears of a darker side; a new
generation of gambling addicts, a cash cow for the Government, a tax on
the poor, a drain on charitable donations, a blight on the gaming
industry, a flippant pursuit that brings out the acquisitive, venal
worst in all of us.
Camelot, who have made money hand over fist on their prodigiously
popular baby, insist that one year on it remains a harmless bit of fun
and a good source of revenue for countless worthy projects. ''None of us
could have anticipated the results that we have seen in the first
year,'' said Norman Hawkins, Camelot's director of operations,
yesterday. ''It has clearly become the people's lottery in the UK. More
than 60% of adults are playing it and its popularity is almost
universal. It's as popular in Guildford as it is in Glasgow.''
But that popularity has brought accusations of a nation addicted to
gambling, accusations Camelot dismiss as nonsense.
''There is no evidence to suggest the nation is becoming a nation of
gambling addicts,'' said Camelot's Sara Linney. ''The gambling industry
before the lottery was worth #20 billion, we have possibly added #2
billion. People forget that the gambling industry in the UK is one of
the most advanced in the world.''
What cannot be in doubt, however, is that the Lottery has drawn more
of us to gambling. Today 89% of us take a gamble compared to 74% before
the Lottery was launched last year. By May this year Gambler's Anonymous
was reporting that 20% of its increased flow of calls related to the
Lottery and a GA spokesman said about 90% of the compulsive gamblers
they see are now quoting the Lottery among their concerns.
In July, the influential Joseph Rowntree Foundation claimed that
addictive gambling was increasing and called for the creation of a
Government-run gambling research unit. Other studies suggest that the
poorer members of society are four times more likely to buy tickets than
others. One recent study suggested that 79% of manual workers played the
game but only 60% of the more affluent white-collar sector.
''You can see it at the Post Office where my wife works,'' said
*Garry, a recovering gambler who now helps others with the same problem
in Glasgow. ''The people come in, get their benefit and then go straight
over and spend #10 on scratch cards. If they don't win they spend
another #10. It's a vicious cycle they get into and one they can't
afford to be in.''
Iain Brown, an expert in gambling addiction at Strathclyde University,
however, believes that for around 90% of us the Lottery is largely
harmless fun. ''But unfortunately for an unknown percentage it's not
just harmless fun and it does represent a major diversion of funds for
other things that are essential and very often that is hitting a
population which is least able to afford it.
''There is no addictive personality but there are certain
vulnerabilities to addiction and one of them is to live in an
impoverished environment where they have few outlets and pleasures.''
Camelot, meanwhile, insist there are other studies which show that it
is the middle-income bracket who fork out the most, but the average
remains a prudent #2 a week. They also claim that only 2% of the
population spend #3 or more on scratch cards. ''If anything we are
biased towards the middle-market,'' said Sara Linney. ''But it has such
a wide appeal. There is very little bias across age or sex or social
class.''
Mark Griffiths, a senior lecturer in psychology at Nottingham Trent
University, believes it is important to distinguish between the Lottery
and the Instants scratch-card games.
''The National Lottery is unlikely ever to become addictive as it
stands at the moment because the gap is too long,'' he said. ''You have
one chance a week to do it -- there just aren't enough opportunities to
gamble. Scratch cards, however, I describe as paper fruit machines. You
can get the result instantly and there are repeated opportunities to
gamble again and again and again -- these are potentially addictive.''
Griffiths believed, however, that the lottery had stimulated a demand
for gambling across the UK that was never there before. ''There's a
whole increase in the accessibility of gambling, an increase in the
numbers overall and an increase in the number of problems.
''There's a suggestion Camelot are going to go to a mid-week Lottery
draw. That, I think, sets a dangerous precedent. In Spain there is a
daily draw and people get more and more addicted, the shorter you make
the gap the more likely you are to become addicted. In some US states
they have hourly draws which are potentially very addictive.''
Linney says there are no plans for a midweek draw, yet. ''That's done
in many countries and it is a possibility, but it's a long way off, a
long way away, if it ever happens.''
Gambling addiction aside, much has also been made in recent months of
the impact on charities, with some estimates suggesting that Scotland's
voluntary organisations will have lost #10m this year over and above the
Lottery charity handouts. If you've got the odd #1 to spare, the
charities say, it's going on a scratch card rather than in the
collecting tin.
Lucy Pratt, policy analyst for the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, said one of the key problems is that Scots appear to be
confused about how much goes from each Lottery ticket or scratch card to
charity and many think it's a good way to help deserving causes. The
correct figure is 5.6p, but an SCVO survey conducted over the past year
found that in March most Scots thought it was 26p; in June they thought
it was 23p; and in September they thought it was 19p.
Asked if they thought playing the Lottery was a good way of giving to
charity, 66% of Scots agreed in March, 44% in June, and 37% in
September. The rest of the UK is even more confused. In England and
Wales 68% thought it was good for charities in March, 56% in June, and
54% in September.
''People are led to believe that it's as easy to give to charity by
giving yourself a chance to win #20, but that's not true,'' said Pratt.
She admitted, however, that the lottery had galvanised some sectors of
the charity community into looking at the way they fund-raise. ''It's
put a rocket up behind some charities who have been quite complacent in
the past about always being able to raise money.''
Camelot, meanwhile, said their own study showed that 68% of people
were giving the same amount to charity, with only 11% giving a little
less and 4% giving a lot less. They said a total of 92% claimed the
Lottery had made no difference to their giving to charity.
Long before the launch last November, church leaders were among the
most vociferous in their opposition to the idea of a Lottery, fearing an
unwholesome nationwide obsession with pecuniary gain.
The Rev Bill Wallace of the Church of Scotland's Board of Social
Responsibility now believes their fears were well-founded. ''The
concerns we expressed beforehand we see coming to pass in front of us
and that's not a comfortable thing to watch. It's basically seeking to
encourage and exploit the downside of human nature. That's not a good
thing; greed, acquisitiveness and the attendant problems with that. Here
the poorer people are paying a disproportionate amount to the Lottery
and the Government are taking that in and using that as a form of
indirect taxation.
''I think there are many distressing stories coming out of people who
have thought they have an answer to their problems with the jackpot, but
it's more unmitigated pain for them. There's evidence that what's
happened in other countries is happening here, we're becoming addicted
to it and it tends to lead on to addiction on other forms of gambling.''
But surely the beauty of the Lottery is that there is no compulsion on
anyone to play?
''There's enormous pressure on people,'' said Wallace. ''The
Government has waived all the rules about advertising gambling and
there's a huge amount of pressure on people to take part and there's
great pressure on the poor.''
But despite all the criticisms and the concerns and the astronomically
remote one-in-14-million chance of the finger pointing at you, we are
showing no signs of disenchantment with this new incarnation of Lady
Luck. A Camelot study found that 90% of the British public have played
the game, 89% approve of it, 71% think it's good thing for the country
and 60% think it's just a harmless flutter. By yesterday morning, the
media were descending on the latest winners and by next Saturday night,
the queues will be lengthening at the retail outlets.
''It's a bit of fun,'' said Linney. ''If you go around on Saturday
night there are queues of people standing saying: 'Oh if I win #20m I'll
go off to the Canaries to live, get my yacht,' that kind of thing.
People imagine: it might just be me.''
Well it might just be you, but then again, there are 13,999,999 other
reasons why it might not.

<TEXT>
DEPUTY Prime Minister Michael Heseltine last night denied he was in
secret negotiations with the heads of the privatised utilities aimed at
persuading them to offer bill rebates to customers.
''This story has too familiar a characteristic of much of modern
reporting: it happens to be untrue,'' Mr Heseltine said.
Asked if there had been any contact or meetings with the gas, water
and electricity companies, Mr Heseltine said: ''I have had no contact
with them. It's not my job. I have had no contacts.''
His comments followed a newspaper report which claimed he was planning
to wreck Labour's windfall tax plan on privatised utilities by urging
the company heads to offer a series of rebates to customers before a
1997 general election.
According to the report, Mr Heseltine had asked electricity companies
to give two rebates, one already agreed for the National Grid, to be
followed by a second from the regional electricity companies.
It would cut the average bill by between a third and half over the
year.
British Gas was also being urged to cut bills, it was reported, but an
attempt to persuade British Telecom to give a #50 rebate was said to
have come to grief.
Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, was said to have told Mr Heseltine
that Labour leader Tony Blair's offer of a deal to enter the
entertainment market was worth more to him than fear of a Labour
windfall tax.
;;FETCHED BY REMOTE USER XPARKY ON 13-NOV-95 AT 12:25
Earlier, Labour Consumer Affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths had scribed
the reported plans as ''the worst sort of electioneering'' and called on
Mr Heseltine to ''take action on utility prices now''.
Mr Griffiths said: ''This arm-twisting comes far too late to protect
consumers from gross profiteering.
''This is an admission that Michael Heseltine has known all along that
water, electricity and gas consumers were being grossly over-charged as
world prices have plummeted.''
A Labour Party spokesman added: ''The Government has allowed the
privatised utilities to get away with huge profits and are now
desperately seeking a last-minute way of trying to claw the money
back.''
However, a BT spokesman denied any such meeting had taken place
between Sir Iain and Mr Heseltine.
''Nor was the matter of a rebate discussed at any other time,'' he
said.

A FORMER gym teacher sexually abused two teenage girl pupils 19 years
ago, a court heard yesterday.
The offences came to light in 1993, when the victims met by chance in
a Leith cafe and began to reminisce about their schooldays.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, George Brough, 52, of Cluny Terrace,
Morningside, Edinburgh, admitted indecency offences with the teenage
girls who were pupils at Holyrood High School in Edinburgh at the time.
The offences took place in 1976, when the girls were aged 15, and took
place at the school, in Holyrood Park and, in one case, in the Braid
Hills.
Mr Craig Scott, Advocate-depute, told the court that Brough had
resigned as a teacher in 1981 for a matter unrelated to the present
charges.
He explained that the offences had taken place after both girls had
confided in Brough because they had personal problems.
Neither had reported the incidents after Brough had told them that if
they said anything he would probably lose his job and it could lead to
the break-up of his family. One of the girls had just suffered the
break-up of her own family and did not want to be the cause of a split
in Brough's family.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, said Brough, who is married with six
children, was a ''shamed and ashamed man''.
At the time of the offences, Brough had been under considerable stress
and had difficulties at home. He had sought psychiatric help for his
problems.
The accused had worked with a boys' football team in 1978, was active
in the church, and had undergone a profound spiritual change in his
life.
Lord Johnston told Brough he had breached the trust between teacher
and pupil and was sure he understood how grave that was. However, it
might be one of these rare cases where a non-custodial sentence could be
justified.
The judge deferred sentence until December 4 at the High Court in
Glasgow to obtain background reports.

TO PEE or not to pee, that was the question. Whether t'was nobler to
suffer the slings and arrows of outraged teachers, or just to hold on
until the final curtain. In the end Jane Horrocks, as a reportedly
incontinent Lady Macbeth, opted to hold it all in.
But it would have taken more than a splash of on-stage urination to
rescue this bizarrely misconceived production by Phoebus Cart. Directed
and starring Mark Rylance, it makes the unlikely move to update and
relocate Shakespeare's tragedy to a contemporary Hare Krishna-style
cult, all orange robes and bowing welcomes, with New Age travellers and
rave culture hanging round on the periphery.
There are two questions to ask here: what does Macbeth tell us about
cults and what do cults tell us about Macbeth? To answer the first, I'd
guess Rylance is suggesting that even peace-loving fringe religions are
susceptible to power struggles and vicious politicking. But so mild
mannered is the conflict that even at the end I was still expecting
Macbeth to announce he was about to go into arbitration with Macduff to
talk this bad vibe through.
And what do cults tell us about Macbeth? Well, on the strength of this
showing, that Shakespeare wrote a load of cod eastern-philosophical
guff.
For even without the orange imagery -- gimmick or not -- nearly all
the parts except the two leads are so indifferently acted that it's a
real effort to bother listening, let alone follow the story.
In the second half an illuminated sign reading ''hurly-burly''
appears, ''mumbo-jumbo'' would have been more appropriate. Meditate on
the memory of Michael Boyd's version and levitate past this one.

CRICKET
GRAHAM Thorpe is confident he can blank out his Kimberley nightmare
and resume normal service when the first Test starts on Thursday. Thorpe
managed just four runs in two innings during England's embarrassing
six-wicket defeat by South Africa A and now has only a couple of
practice sessions to prepare for the real thing in Pretoria.
''My form is not much to go on,'' admitted the Surrey left-hander who,
over the course of the last 12 months, has become a key figure in his
country's batting line-up.''
But England seem certain to stand by him when they pick their team for
the first Test. Thorpe was one of the few successes of last winter's
disastrous Ashes tour and, during the summer, he averaged 42 against
West Indies.
Thorpe added: ''When Thursday comes, everyone will start on the same
level. There will be nerves on both sides.''
Results yesterday:
First Test, at Brisbane. Australia 463 (S R Waugh 112 n.o., M A Taylor
69, M E Waugh 59, G S Blewett 57, D C Boon 54); Pakistan 97 (S K Warne
7-23) and 240 (Aamir Sohail 99, Inzamam-ul-Haq 62, S K Warne 4-54, G
McGrath 4-76). Australia beat Pakistan by an innings and 126 runs.
Tour match, at Lahore. Pakistan Cricket Board XI 301 (Saeed Azad 117,
Shadab Kabir 61, Adil Nisar 57, D W Headley 5-68) and 67 for four;
England A 355 (A McGrath 103, N Hussain 83, J E R Gallian 67, Mubashir
Nazeer 4-51).

God made the wicked Grocer
For a mystery and a sign,
That men might shun the awful shops
And go to inns to dine.
VERILY, the ancient rhymer wrote well. Even more now than then does
wisdom lie in eating out. For never to a meek and innocent fellow has
the buying of food been just the job. With every shopping day that
passes, it becomes more of a battle.
While doing the messages has long felt like going five rounds
according to the Queensberry rules, the latest wickedness of grocers has
been to invent their own kind of boxing match. Weeks after everybody
else, I have noticed that points are being awarded for how I score at
the check-out.
They give you a strip of tissue paper with strange writing upon it.
All of your exotic purchases are listed in a child's code -- gran sugar
golden; potatoes new loose; dat (for dates); and bananas ls, signifying
also loose, perhaps.
Every sensible shopper should peruse every line. There are in this
world wise travellers who read and inwardly digest each word on train
tickets. But it takes an especially idle day to feast the eyes on a
grocery list.
I read that I have become a 32-pointer of a shopper.
If that seems good counting, it hardly rates at all in the supermarket
league. One point is awarded (pray, let me get this right) for each 100p
spent. Serious counting doesn't start until a century is scored.
One hundred points qualifies for a box of little chocolate logs. All
free. (Is there a more expensive word in the language than ''free''?)
For 200 points a bigger spender moves into the realm of hair shampoo or
a gratis car wash. Not at the same time, you understand.
At 500 points spendthrifts have bought their way into gracious lives
which have in them chicken fillets and a bottle of tawny port. But it is
only at twice that mountain of credits that high living starts.
Thousand-pointers win tickets on a ferry from Dover to Calais.
At this rate, before I can put Calais on a postcard they will be
selling discount shuttle tickets to Jupiter.
Worse humbling follows. While the check-out operators who add up the
loose bananas get their names on the chit, a paying customer appears as
a number. And it is an 18-digit number at that. Even the armed forces
used to keep their people in their places with only eight numerals.
Eighteen make you feel about as significant as an ant.
Because shops are a branch of showbusiness, new tricks are not to be
expected from them. Any apparent innovation can only be an old idea
wrapped differently. What the supermarkets are up to is a wan version of
the old Co-op dividend.
Such a giant stride brings shopping bang up to date with 1844. At
their shop in Toad Lane in Rochdale, pioneer shopkeepers baited custom
by paying a divi. Soon it was up to 12p in the #1, away head of this
puny point-a-pound award.
The world was simpler then. For its opening the Rochdale Co-op stocked
butter, sugar, flour, and oatmeal. They also had candles but needed them
for themselves to light the shop. Later was added tea and tobacco. After
that the pioneers started to mill their own unadulerated flour.
Though simpler, it was not a more honest world.
One of the hallowed principles of the pioneers was fair dealing. They
meant to trade so purely that customers would not hestitate to sent
their children for the messages.
Previously, to trust grocers had never been wise. Whoever wrote the
little hate poem at the top reflected a widespread distrust. No food
shopping was safe. Milk got watered. Flour had potatoes or beans lumped
into it and sometimes was whitened with alum. Hedge leaves were mixed
with tea leaves. Gin got pepped up with arsenic. Folk tales persist that
to bread were added burned bones.
In a cleaner, more regulated world, supermarkets have other problems.
Already they seem old-fashioned. Self-service groceries go back to 1912
in California with a chain called Humpty Dumpty. Four years later came
the first check-outs in Memphis, Tennessee, at stores which retain the
title of Piggly Wiggly.
Starting with names like those, supermarkets remain hard to take
seriously. Yet reaching gingerly to bring the divi idea out of the back
shop of the past gives hope. Getting back to basics might come to
include grocers who pack their own sugar and sell broken biscuits in
paper pokes. And Moira at the checkout would know more about what she is
selling than its price.
Somebody else, however, had better lead this revolution because I
cannot be trusted to read my own marks rating. This excursion has been
based on a wrong slip. For it appears that after a weekend splash on egg
lasagne and ice cream from Rothienorman my total has soared to 43
points.
Which is only 957 away from Calais. I am beginning to sniff those sea
breezes already.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke was warned yesterday by a Tory MP that he
would be unable to rely on support for the Budget from some Conservative
back benchers unless he proposed a raft of measures to stimulate the
housing market.
MP Nicholas Winterton, chairman of the manufacturing and construction
industries alliance, said he had written to every Cabinet Minister
urging a package of measures to deal with the ''housing malaise''.
Such a boost was ''essential to the Government's electoral
prospects'', Mr Winterton said. He claimed that a number of Tory
backbenchers would have ''great difficulty in justifying support for any
Budget which did not deliver a package of invigorating measures''.

IF courage is overcoming fear, Christopher Coe has it in abundance.
Coe is a human rights activist and Christian pacifist who broke into
British Aerospace offices in Stevenage in January, 1993, daubed his own
blood all over the nose cones and took a hammer to the sleek, silver,
single-seater Hawk fighter. He then waited for arrest . . .
It's a remarkable story -- not least for the fact, when Coe came on
stage at the end, that he certainly does not look like typical ''hero''
material.
Modest, softly-spoken -- sheepish even -- his disgust at the British
arms trade and BAe in particular (he claims their sale of the fighter to
the Indonesian government who have used it in brutal massacres of the
people in East Timor implicates them in human rights abuse) has set Coe
implacably against the law. He's already attracted a suspended prison
sentence and a custodial one -- but he will not stop.
All of this and more we learnt in Calypso's slightly scrambled though
fast-moving production. Hardly the most conducive of venues for the
human voice, it was at least a performance for the Irish-based
Irish/Scottish company who found their recent performances scheduled for
Glasgow and Edinburgh suddenly cancelled when government funds at the
Irish end dried up.
Kenneth Glenaan and Donal O'Kelly's pop-up cartoon-style of
dramatisation certainly combined vigour with compassion, if tending
towards didacticism. But Irish actor Liam Brennan as Coe caught
brilliantly the guile and determination of this very particular
protester -- as well as the apprehension of a man who cannot do other
than follow his conscience even when it pushes him beyond his own
limits.

BRITISH Steel achieved record earnings in the first six months, making
it the most profitable steel company in the world.
In the six months to September, pre-tax profits soared from #159m to
#550m although these include a full six months contribution from the
United Engineering Steels subsidiary after the purchase of the GKN
minority stake.
These figures are widely regarded as marking the peak of the cycle,
with chairman Brian Moffat warning yesterday that in the last three
months there has been an easing in customer demand in Europe due to
de-stocking. Some steel producers are cutting back output rather than
reduce prices.
With an ever greater proportion of the European industry now in the
private sector, profit rather than volume is the driving force. Mr
Moffat underlined this by saying it was better to sacrifice production
than price.
With the lowest cost structure, BS will be able to find alternative
markets more easily in the US and Asia than competitors. Mr Moffat added
that there will be no plant closures and any cutbacks will be through
measures such as reducing the number of shifts. There is a natural
wastage of about 1000 people annually.
Demand from the UK motor industry has trebled in recent years to
900,000 tonnes attributable chiefly to the Japanese car plants and he is
expecting higher sales by both volume and price next year as a result of
the current contract negotiations.
Overall there was a 5% rise in output before the inclusion of UES, now
named British Steel Special Steels, which lifted the total a sixth to
6.9 million tonnes. Sales in the UK were up 14% to 3.6 million tonnes,
while revenue increased by 9% to an average of #360 per tonne.
The cream was found in continental Europe, where high Deutschemark
prices and sterling weakness led to average realisations of #384 per
tonne. However, the rest of the world, at #319, was affected by the
sharp downturn in US hot rolled coil prices which has left European
steel selling at a substantial premium to American equivalents.
Profits in the current half will benefit from BS's acquisition of 1.1%
of the Avesta Sheffield stainless steel producer to give it a 51% stake.
Capital expenditure for the full year will amount to #400m. That will
still leave BS holding large cash balances, giving it the freedom to
trawl the world for acquisitions.
The interim dividend has been raised by half to 3p, pointing to a
full-year total up from 7.5p to at least 10p for a 7.9% yield. While
profits could add #500m to #1050m and then stabilise, the fears of a
downturn do seem exaggerated and the stock, which is selling at 4.7
times likely earnings, does look cheap.

* ADRIAN NOBLE, RSC artistic director: ''A great light has gone out.
When Robert was on form he burned brighter than almost any other actor I
know. He lit up the stage with his extraordinary physical and vocal
energy which belied his weak frame and a body wracked by illness and
abuse. I will remember him as a great raconteur, a great embellisher of
the truth, a dedicated smoker, a fearsome drinker, wonderful company for
lunch, a wicked silver wit, a great actor, a friend and a cat with 10
lives.''
* EDWARD FOX, star of Day of the Jackal, who played Iago to Sir
Robert's Othello for the Regent's Park Company when they were young
actors: ''It is very sad. I owe him a massive amount of gratitude as a
friend and an actor. We got on very well. His technique was marvellous.
He was born an actor, not made.''
* DAME MAGGIE SMITH: ''Robert was a colourful if complicated character
and a very, very fine actor.''
* SIR PETER HALL, who directed the actor at the National Theatre: ''I
truly admired him. Robert Stephens was one of the great actors of his
generation and yet his greatness was almost undeclared until very
recently when he amazed and delighted us with Falstaff and King Lear.
Theatre people will always be reminded that great talent is often a
curse as well as a blessing.''
* MICHAEL THORNTON, producer: ''Robert could rub people up the wrong
way. Elizabeth Taylor had him fired from the film of A Little Night
Music and I recall having dinner with him and Marlene Dietrich in
Brighton when he was outrageously behaved.''
* TARN BASSETT, his second wife: ''I knew about the affairs but we had
many happy years together. I never saw the drinking because he couldn't
afford it. I don't know if I could have coped with that but we still
loved each other and I adore his wife Patty and the boys, and Robert
loved his grandchildren very much.''

MY JOB
The freelance journalist
Beverley Brown's way with words keeps her busy in more ways than one,
finds Eric Kennedy
WORDS are what matter to Beverley Brown. Spoken or written, they come
out in a fluent gush, always worth reading or listening to. Which is
just as well, for that is how she earns her living.
Beverley is a freelance journalist with a wide background not only in
that profession of elegant wordsmiths but also in marketing and PR. She
can rattle off a story, magazine article, general feature, or specialist
item on property or health at the drop of a shorthand notebook. And she
can use the spoken word to some effect, which makes her ideally
qualified for teaching young people the skills necessary to make one's
way in journalism.
She started living by the word, so to speak, when she was asked to
establish what was Scotland's first freesheet newspaper in 1979. That
was after a period of training to be a nurse, and of doing a
high-powered job as Scottish representative for a big drugs company.
The freesheet consisted mainly of advertising but she was also writing
other material, and by now she had the bug. She moved on to various
local papers, working in the advertising departments and having a lot of
material published.
Then she got ''this wonderful idea to challenge the brain cells'' and
took a BA in Communications Studies at Glasgow College of Technology
(now Caledonian University). These three years also challenged her
equanimity -- many of the lecturers were younger than she, and she felt
surrounded by 17-year-old students. ''But they were the best three years
of my life,'' she says.
Her course concentrated on marketing and media with ''some
journalism''. Of equal significance, she says, was the fact that she was
doing writing at night, mainly PR material. But it was still writing.
She also got a lucky break when asked to organise the Modern Homes
Exhibition for its last two years at the Kelvin Hall. It meant two
full-time summer jobs -- from May to October -- during the summer
holidays and her promotional and writing efforts met with no little
success.
After getting her degree in 1985 she became PR manager for a major
estate agency for nearly 10 years, in a period which saw her hone her
writing and presentational skills even more.
Her job involved a great deal of feature material and she was becoming
better known within what is popularly referred to as ''the media
world''. She took the plunge into real, all-out freelance journalism at
the end of 1994 and nowadays writes for various daily and evening
papers, specialist magazines, and journals.
She works from home, too, relishes being her own boss, and ''just
loves'' her home office where her AppleMac, laser printer, modem, fax,
and answering machine sit in readiness for the next commission. ''I
never miss a deadline,'' she says. ''And my husband and children know
better than to interrupt me if I have a rush job on. They send up cups
of coffee to keep me going.''
And although she emphasises that she by no means knows the whole
story, she teaches the PR side of an HND communications course at
Anniesland College in Glasgow, and the journalism part of a similar one
at Cardonald.
There are, she says, many such courses available these days but there
is no substitute for ''hands-on'' experience and for having material
published. ''That is what counts, as much as qualifications,'' she says.
''And a job in a local paper, with qualifications to come later, is the
ideal combination.''

THE Government yesterday played down talk of a rift with Dublin over
the state of the Ulster peace process, only 24 hours after rebuffing
with ''dismay and astonishment'' a call from Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton for immediate all-party talks.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew admitted that he had
been surprised by Mr Bruton's speech on Saturday, but insisted the
problem lay in a difference of emphasis on the arms decommissioning
issue.
Mr Major returned to London yesterday after attending the Commonwealth
summit in New Zealand, but last night there were no plans for any
ministerial meetings or talks on Northern Ireland.
On Sunday, the Prime Minister made clear that he thought Mr Bruton's
suggestion that Britain soften its stance on the need for the IRA to
surrender its weapons was ''not on'', but by yesterday afternoon Downing
Street was playing down any threat to the peace efforts.
Speaking in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick said: ''There is no rift
with the Irish Government, sometimes there is a difference of emphasis
over the principal obstacle to all-party talks and that obstacle is
placed there by Sinn Fein and their associates in the Provisional IRA.''
Mr Bruton said the peace process had become stalled and called for
accelerating progress towards all-party talks, despite Britain's refusal
to involve Sinn Fein in the talks until it has accepted the need for the
IRA to decommission its arms.
Sir Patrick explained: ''I must not destroy the process upon which
everything depends by calling a conference when I know that, by reason
of the refusal to get rid of even a beginning of the arms, that there
will be chairs empty around the table.''
He added: ''I think it is well understood that it was a speech which
had some surprising connotations as to timing and content. Don't suppose
this is a unique occasion when there is a difference of emphasis between
the two governments.''
Sir Patrick argued that unless Sinn Fein renounced violence and backed
the surrender of weapons, Unionist participation in the talks would be
in question. Without naming them, he said other parties around the table
would refuse to be confronted by somebody ''who is actually threatening
the use of armaments to back up their arguments.''
Deputy Irish Prime Minister Dick Spring emphasised that there was a
''good working relationship'' between the two governments.
Mr Spring, speaking on Irish Radio, backed Mr Bruton, but tried to
dispel the tensions.
''We have had our difficulties in the past couple of months, we have
had an impasse in the UK-Irish process.
''The Taoiseach has his responsibilities and he set out the position
as we saw it,'' he said.
He added: ''It is very obvious that John Major wants to move the
process forward. I think his reaction was the correct one -- not the one
we got on Saturday evening. We are not that far apart.''
The leader of the third party in the Irish Republic's coalition
government last night endorsed Mr Bruton's tougher stance on the peace
process.
Proinsias De Rossa, head of the Democratic Left grouping and Social
Welfare Minister in Mr Bruton's administration, said the Premier's
speech represented ''a change of tone in relation to the British, but
not a change of policy''.
Mr De Rossa said: ''I think you will find that as a result of Mr
Bruton's timely intervention, putting on the record our concerns for the
peace process, we will get movement.''
The focus of the peace process will this week switch to the United
States, where both Unionist and republican politicians will attempt to
persuade politicans and the public to back their respective positions.
Loyalist fringe parties will spend five days in Washington for
meetings with Irish-American politicians and Clinton administration
officials.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams is due to meet White House national
security adviser Anthony Lake ahead of President Bill Clinton's visit to
Northern Ireland later this month.

LAST Wednesday Michael Fry was complaining on this page about how
people like him, who believe in a small state, low taxes, and frugal
public expenditure, are being disenfranchised, even by the present-day
Tory party.
Michael's growing sense of isolation will doubtless have been
compounded by the correspondence from Social Security Minister Peter
Lilley to Treasury chief secretary William Waldegrave, leaked
subsequently, in which one of the Cabinet's ultra-dries is revealed in
the depths of private despair over the scale of cuts planned in his
department's running costs next year.
With the likes of Lilley gone soft, what's Michael Fry to do? Start
his own party, perhaps? After all, it's all the rage. But before he
does, let's subject Fry's central premise -- that the countries which
successfully roll back the state are the ones whose citizens prosper
most in the end -- to closer scrutiny.
Is there, as Michael Fry claims, citing the United States, New
Zealand, and Italy as examples, a convincing correlation between low
levels of public expenditure on the one hand and sustained high levels
of economic growth on the other?
The fashionable comparisons among roll-back-the-state enthusiasts and
public spending pruners on the right are not Fry's mature troika, but
the Asian tiger economies where government spending takes, on average,
20% of gross domestic product (compared with the 43.5% pencilled in for
the UK this year), but annual growth rates are, on average, four times
ours.
First-hand experience of that comparison has prompted a much wetter
Tory, Hong Kong governor Chris Patten, to recant and reflect recently
''that some reduction in the state's take of national income is an
essential condition for more rapid growth''.
Like everyone who has witnessed the remarkable economic dynamism of
the Pacific rim at first hand, Patten is desperately seeking keys which
will unlock doors to some of that fast-track action for Britain. But
many of the doors on offer open on to blind alleys.
We cannot, with the best part of two centuries of industrialisation
already behind us, simply reinvent ourselves as an emerging European
tiger economy, no matter how much ministers prattle on about turning
Britain into the enterprise heart of Europe.
Nor can we turn ourselves back into a nation of graduate software
engineers happy to work for $2000 a year or factory workers willing to
work for a lot less. And, given our lingering attachment to our battered
democratic traditions, we cannot even contemplate copying the more
coercive aspects of life in some of the Asian tigers.
So the only door left is the seductive one marked low public spending.
Low levels of public expenditure in the emerging Asian economies reflect
minimal state welfare provision. That, it is argued, forces people to
depend on their own skills and ingenuity to survive and prosper and adds
to the dynamism of the economy as a whole.
But these same economies are also investing heavily in physical
infrastructure and in improving the skills of their people. Is it the
minimal investment in welfare or the far-from-minimal investment in
infrastructure and skills which is driving such phenomenal growth rates?
We simply do not know.
Even if the state opting out of welfare were the key to Asian success,
advocates of that model here fail to address two crucial issues. The
first is the rise, over time, in personal aspiration in many of these
emerging economies, both in terms of improved welfare provision and
higher wages.
Japan, the most mature tiger of all, still holds its government
expenditure at less than 20% of GDP. But there the bubble burst in the
1990s and the economy, immensely strong as it still is, is frantically
searching for new ways forward.
The other weakness in such advocacy is the sheer political
impossibility, within any democratic society, of persuading enough
voters to back a party committed to cutting public spending's share of
the national cake in half. For us, apeing the public spending patterns
of the Asian tigers is a chimera.
To be fair to Michael Fry, he did not advance that argument. He cited
the United States, New Zealand, and Italy -- all mature developed
economies, like ours -- as proof of his claim that the more you roll
back the state, the more you prosper.
But, as Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics
demonstrated in the Financial Times recently, there simply is no
consistent relationship, over time, between per capita growth rates and
the share of GDP any government takes and spends, even when you compare
countries at similar stages of economic development.
Average real growth per capita in the United States between 1979 and
1994, at 1.3%, was one of the lowest among OECD nations, although the
American government is the most frugal spender, accounting for only
one-third of national GDP. Italy managed an average per capita growth
rate of 1.8%, putting it in the OECD top four. But Italy's government
spends more than 50% of GDP, fully 10% more than the UK over the period.
Sweden, which delivered the most miserable growth, was also the
biggest state spender. But next door neighbour Norway, which turned in
the most consistently impressive growth, still spends more than half the
country's GDP.
Critics attack Professor Layard for using per capita growth figures in
his analysis. They claim that penalises more successful economies which
attract migrants and enjoy birth-rate boosts. There is, they argue, a
demonstrable link between growth in GDP itself and lower state spending.
Cut state spending by 10% of GDP and you can boost annual growth by
one-third of 1%, claims one.
GIVEN the problems the Major government is having -- not least with
the arid Mr Lilley -- in carving less than 1% from state spending's
share of GDP in this Budget, I wonder at that critic's political
naivety.
On this one, Michael, I suspect your sense of isolation may linger for
a while. But you are far from alone in feeling disenfranchised. There's
a growing body of opinion out there which feels the state should be
investing more, not less, on areas like primary and secondary education.
But, given the current competition between the Government and the new
model Labour Party at Westminster to appear fiscally prudent, that's not
on the agenda either. As you put it, such views are simply not allowed.

THE Saudi Arabian ambassador in London insisted yesterday that the
bomb in Riyadh which killed several Americans and injured scores more
was an isolated incident. Strictly speaking he was correct as this is
the first serious attempt to harm large numbers of foreigners in the
Saudi capital. It is not, however, an isolated example of active
discontent with the regime of King Fahd and his family. Last month two
bombs were thrown into a mosque in a village near Riyadh killing eight
people. Islamic fundamentalists detest the Fahd regime and work
energetically to undermine it. Until now it has been assumed that the
tight security which operates throughout Saudi Arabia had succeeded in
muzzling dissenting voices, especially as many of them are to be found
in exile in London and other western capitals. It is now painfully
obvious that opposition within Saudi Arabia is organised and armed and
bold enough to target the American military which is a major prop of the
Saudi armed forces and the regime in general.
All of this is worrying for Washington. The United States has
important interests in Saudi Arabia and President Clinton has put
considerable work into relations with the kingdom. US officials are
examining what might happen when the septuagenarian King Fahd's reign
comes to an end. Other less friendly groups are clearly manoeuvring with
the same event in mind. Western security reports before yesterday's
bombing did not underestimate the possibility of serious opposition but
concluded that the Saudi authorities could cope. Similarly they believe
that the Saudi economy, which is far from healthy, has sufficient
reserves of oil to ride out any problems.
This is no doubt comforting to the West and to the Saudis but
assessments of this sort have been drastically wrong in the near past,
specifically in Iran, where the otherwise estimable British ambassador,
Sir Anthony Parsons, could see no real threat to the Shah's throne even
as it toppled. Whatever the deficiencies of the Saudi regime, a repeat
of that mistake would cause serious problems for the West as well as the
Gulf in general.

A COMBINATION of increased passenger numbers, higher retail income and
profits from property disposals enabled airports operator BAA to report
interim profits in line with City expectations at #294m before tax.
Passenger numbers grew by 5.8% to 51.9 million with the strongest
growth at the start of the period under review, in April. Figures
published for October show an increase of 4.6%. This figure masks a slow
start to the month followed by much faster growth in the past two weeks.
As expected, the Eurostar train service depressed demand for flights
between London and Paris and accounted for most of a loss of 125,000
passengers a month on the route. The effect on the Brussels route was
minimal. Within the group's overall traffic growth figures, the European
scheduled sector was up only 3.5%, with the lowest increase seen in the
short-haul charter sector.
The prolonged hot summer in the UK coupled with fragile consumer
confidence reduced demand. The European scheduled sector accounts for
one third of BAA's passengers.
One weak spot in the business in terms of passengers was Glasgow
airport where business was depressed by a 9.5% reduction in the number
of international travellers. In contrast, Edinburgh showed the second
highest growth in overall numbers at 10.1%.
There were several factors behind the reduction at Glasgow. These
included a drop in charter traffic, a cut back in European scheduled
services and the withdrawal of transatlantic flights by United and
NorthWest Airlines. However, on the plus side, nearly all this
transatlantic traffic was picked up by Heathrow and Gatwick. This, in
turn, boosted demand between London and Glasgow and Edinburgh.
One of the key planks of BAA's growth strategy is the development of
its retail business. Good progress was made in the first half with gross
retail revenue up 9.1% to #298.1m. Net retail income per passenger grew
by 3.4% to #4.10.
Duty and tax-free income increased by 13.1% to #111m despite the
long-term trend away from tobacco and hard liquor. This was achieved
through aggressive marketing and a particular focus on skin care
products and perfume, where income rose by 23.4% over last year. The
world's first airport beauty centre opened in Heathrow Terminal One last
month.
Airport charges and other traffic revenues grew by 3.6% to #288.3m.
Property revenue advanced by 11% to #104.9m. The group's financial
position remains strong with gearing at 29.8% compared to 29.1% last
year. Net interest payable increased by #5.3m to #45.3m. Airport capital
expenditure at #154m was down on last year, reflecting phased programmes
and delays to both Terminal Five at Heathrow, which is the subject of a
public enquiry, and Heathrow Express.
Commenting on the results, chief executive Sir John Egan said the
company was shaping up for the 21st century and the country could be
proud of it. BAA remains on course to achieve its target of 5% to 6%
traffic growth for the year in spite of the Channel tunnel and the
slowdown in the domestic economy. Its shares remained at 485p.

JUST when you begin to believe that women have lost all sense of what
to wear in a crisis, Jessye Norman glides into view, her proud,
monumental presence swathed in an ocean of silk. But hark, there is
anger in that magnificent voice, a thunderous anger which can rattle
window panes and make even the grandest orchestra sound puny.
In a lawsuit filed in New York the other day the American
mezzo-soprano claimed that she, and all people of African-American
descent, had been ridiculed by an article which was featured in Classic
CD magazine last year. The text, she insisted, was racist in tone,
portraying Norman -- at least in her view -- as ''an uneducated and
ill-spoken person''. But what also offended the singer were the derisive
and inaccurate references to her weight. She maintained that one
particular anecdote about the unfortunate lot of a fat diva negotiating
swing doors en route to a concert, was knowingly mis-attributed to
Norman. The price of such a slur? A demand for #2m in damages.
The fact is that Jessye Norman has always been sensitive about her
size. In this thin-obsessed society how could she be otherwise? Big
women, whatever their skin colour, suffer discimination, their cast-off
treatment by the ragtrade being the most obvious proof. Sometimes such
snide dismissal is lastingly hurtful, but Norman has always seemed to
triumph over malicious sniggers by adorning her weight with such stately
opulence it achieves the miracle of pure style.
On stage and in life she appears like some glistening deity, solitary
in her power even when packed around with fellow singers, musicians or
the faithful. The oiled lids above those melancholy, watchful eyes, that
pagan head, and the creamy, garnet mouth and marvellous teeth, and those
tiny, tribal plaits worked so close to the skull they resemble ebony
carvings . . . all these features comprise the brilliant pageantry of a
black artist whose sense of self owes nothing to white ideals of beauty.
But the problem with opera and many of those associated with it is
that it so often pitches art into the realm of absurdity. As a result
there are times when not even a good tune can overcome the daftness of
Joan Sutherland trudging across the stage as Lucia Di Lammermuir,
looking like Charles Bronson in drag. Or Pavarotti lunging forward in
all that uncut moquette, offering a sort of tenor version of the cresta
run. Yet at La Scala's theatrical museum in Milan there is something
about the musty drama of old divas which challenges even the most
irreverent observer.
Empty costumes, dating from the early 1800s, stand about like opera's
other phantoms, reminders of Giuseppina Grassini's heroic bosom, Adelina
Patti's trembling ribcage, and Maria Malibran trailing velvet acres,
gathered and ruched for Rossini's Desdemona. Nearby there is Giudetta
Pasta's sword which once belonged to Napoleon and was given to her by an
admirer. Apparently she clutched it to herself beneath her cloaks, a
reckless talisman against disaster.
Stealing into one of the theatre boxes you might glimpse a rehearsal
in progress, but even this may stretch credulity to breaking point. A
soprano in demins, a baritone in a Pringle sweater . . . opera singers
look incongruous in everyday clothes. It's like watching a ballet dancer
in full entrechat, clutching his bi-focals.
Jessye Norman's stature, of course, has caused dustups before. The
most notable occurred during the bicentenary celebrations of the French
Revolution, when Norman, draped in the tricolour in the Place de la
Concorde, wrapped her soaring voice around the Marseillaise. But behind
that event, relations were far from harmonious between the singer and
the then Minister of Culture, the swanky Jack Lang.
Only days before, in front of international press, Lang had insulted
Norman by denying his department had ever invited her for a starring
role. Instead, he implied that it was she who had picked up the phone
and demanded top billing. ''But you spoke to me first,'' she replied in
astonishment. ''No, no. You did,'' he persisted, frantically trying to
extricate himself from public outrage at the bicentenary's expense. In
fact Norman had offered her services free, and while she received a
soothing apology from President Mitterrand, Lang was left to nurse his
gadfly reputation. So there seems to be a lesson here for those who
would tangle with Norman. More used to conquest than defeat, she stands
aloof from opera's pantomime by the fact that her immensity as an artist
is every bit as substantial as her figure. Those who mock her risk not
only litigation, they stoke the wrath of the divine.

THERE is no need for panic at the news that passenger levels, aircraft
movements, and cargo tonnage through Glasgow Airport are falling.
Equally there should be no complacency, given that many millions of
pounds have been spent upgrading Glasgow to a decent standard for an
international airport only to find that its image in that respect is
less than solid. What is needed from all involved with Glasgow Airport,
from the BAA, Strathclyde region, and the wider business community, is a
detailed investigation of what might be going wrong and how it should be
remedied. Some suggestions have already been made. The fall in passenger
traffic is attributed to the drop in charter movements over the late
summer when many people are believed to have enjoyed sunshine at home
rather than opting for a break abroad. This may be partly true, but it
also sounds perilously close for comfort to a British Rail
leaves-on-the-line excuse.
More realistic worries focus on the role of traffic congestion between
Glasgow city and the airport in convincing travellers that they would be
better flying from Edinburgh, which is currently exhibiting a healthy
increase in passenger numbers. It is true that the motorway network
around Glasgow is a disincentive to come anywhere near the city, and
certainly to anyone intending to travel from central Scotland or the
east to the airport. Matters are made worse by the troubles of the
Kingston Bridge which will face five years of reconstruction work from
next January. These road and bridge improvements must be made, but they
are not a solution to the problem.
Edinburgh has the right idea with its plan for a rapid transport
scheme on dedicated lines which will cut travel between the city and the
airport to a mere 11 minutes. Glasgow has similar hopes for a rail link
to Glasgow Airport, but they are still unformed and -- with the problems
over the future of ScotRail, Railtrack, and the new local authority --
are likely to have a lengthy gestation, even if conception does occur.
Nevertheless they represent the best hope for rescuing Glasgow Airport
from the traffic island on which it is marooned.

Christine Fox reports on the changes
THE latest link between Langside College and the south side community
which it serves officially opens today.
This is a spacious conference theatre which has been constructed from
the college assembly hall. It has been made possible by a #25,000
donation from the Bank of Scotland's tercentenary fund, which has given
money to worthy causes throughout the bank's three hundredth anniversary
year.
Dr Roland Mitchell, general manager responsible for the bank's West of
Scotland operations, presented a cheque for this amount to principal
Alastair Tyre earlier today.
Tonight sees the first event at the theatre. An official opening
ceremony will be held before the college's awards ceremony.
Those who haven't been in the hall since before the refurbishment will
see a huge difference, said assistant principal John Jackson.
''We have installed 275 retractable seats which can be pushed back
into the wall when the theatre needs to be used as a teaching space for
our drama and dance sections,'' he said. ''The stage curtains have also
been replaced, as has the house lighting. To complete the refurbishment
the theatre has also been redecorated.''
The favourable reactions to the work of one of the college courses was
one factor in the decision to transform the theatre. ''We have an
extremely successful drama section which offers courses from National
Certificate level to Higher National Certificate and Higher National
Diploma. The classes will be able to use the theatre as a performance
space.
''We also run a pantomime for local schools every year, with several
thousand school children passing through the college over the Christmas
period. That will be staged in the theatre this year.''
The drama students will continue to stage productions at theatres in
the centre of Glasgow which obviously have more advanced stage
facilities, but Mr Jackson is in no doubt that the improved college
theatre will improve the quality of teaching and rehearsals.
The college is keen to see the theatre develop as a facility for the
whole community. Although it will benefit present and future generations
of students during teaching hours, the college will hire out the space
for use by local groups, particularly during evenings or weekends.
Links with the community are important to the college -- one
particularly successful enterprise has developed at the Glenwood Campus,
situated in Castlemilk, in what is left of Glenwood High School.
Previously funded through the urban programme by Strathclyde Region and
managed by Langside College, the campus has become an integral part of
Langside since March, when urban aid funding ran out.
''One of the most important facilities we have in the Glenwood Campus
is a drop-in flexible learning centre, which takes people with basic
skills and brings them on to a point where they can begin to study for
National Certificate courses. There are people who started in this way
who have now moved up to HNC and HND level.''
The courses at Glenwood are due to move into 10,000 sq ft of new
premises, custom built with significant European funds and support from
the urban programme by the beginning of the next academic year. This
will mean an expansion of facilities for the Castlemilk students.
Building work is also under way at the college's main Prospecthill
Road campus. Mount Florida House, the college's hi-tech business school,
is undergoing a #1m refurbishment with a grant from the Scottish Office
Education and Industry Department (SOEID).
And hopefully with support from European Regional Development Funds,
traditional courses from NC to HND will be offered as well as short
sharp training programmes on the latest software. Disruption has been
kept to a minimum, however, with students being relocated to different
classrooms around the campus until the building reopens in March next
year.
Langside College has probably been best known as an establishment
which gives a second chance at education, with numerous Higher and A
Level courses on offer.
With these essential qualifications under the belts, young and more
mature students have a much-improved chance of furthering their
education with a place at university or college.
In the past couple of years this has been augmented by the scheme
which the college has agreed with the universities of Glasgow,
Strathclyde and Paisley, and Caledonian University.
Students from Langside College who achieve HNC or HND level in social
sciences and science courses can go straight into second year at these
universities. The college also has computer and business courses to
prepare students for these demanding worlds.
Students around the Prospecthill Campus have more opportunities than
most to form friendships with students from around the world.
The thriving TESOL (teaching English as a second language) section has
been one of the college's great successes.
In any one year students from up to 30 countries are presented for
exams. It is innovatory ideas such as this which bring students to the
South Side of Glasgow from all corners of the city -- and much further
afield.
The caring disciplines are well represented at the college with a
choice of social work and child care education qualifications on offer.
''It's true to say that the college is at the forefront of development
in the area of child care courses,'' John Jackson added.
Women who are more interested in areas which have traditionally been
seen as male-dominated will also be interested to know that despite the
construction and engineering recession, Langside continues to offer
courses within these disciplines up to and including Higher National
Certificate level.
The college also offers courses to business -- the school of
horticulture which operates at Woodburn House in Rutherglen provides
qualifications which help industry such as Glasgow's parks department,
numerous florists and the Scottish Greenkeepers' Association.
And, in recognition of a flourishing leisure industry, there are
courses which cover sport and leisure, with students finding employment
in the increasing number of swimming and leisure facilities.
Mature students are always faced with child care problems. In order to
help student returners, a co-operative nursery Little Scholars has been
in operation for several years. The close proximity allows students to
study knowing that their child is being cared for just a few minutes
away. In some cases the nursery operates outwith class times and during
college holidays.
Whether you're interested in hiring the new theatre or continuing
education, contact the college for more information.

COLIN POWELL'S decision not to pursue the presidency in 1996 is
eminently understandable. For one, his race has suddenly been
politicised by recent events. Only a few weeks ago a putative Powell
candidacy had a colour-blind appeal. Here was a gifted man, a lifelong
soldier, hands unsullied in the mire of politics. Insofar as race came
into it, it was a mild political asset: candidate Powell, being black,
could win many Republican votes from a hard-core Democratic base. (Over
90% of American blacks vote Democrat.)
Then O J Simpson got away with it. And Louis Farrakhan held his
terrifying rally. Suddenly, last month, race became the issue of
American politics. The Yanks collapsed in one of their frenzies of
moralising. Was this the failure of the American dream? Had the melting
pot not chilled? Might the Potomac not shortly foam with much blood?
Poor Powell. Overnight he became the Black Candidate; a man
sufficiently eminent, sufficiently squeaky-clean, and sufficiently
cocoa-coloured to meet the hour. His achievements were forgotten. His
gifts were minimised. In a perverse and well-meant racism, all that
Colin Powell might contribute to the nation's weal was reduced to
pigment. It was an insulting, demeaning reduction of his prospects, and
his reaction to it makes perfect sense.
But more: there was the danger, the real threat of sudden and violent
death. Four American Presidents have been murdered in office. Two
contenders have died: Bobby Kennedy, Huey Long. George Wallace, running
in 1972, was paralysed by a sniper's bullet. Franklin Roosevelt, Gerald
Ford, and Ronald Reagan narrowly survived assassination attempts. One or
two mad gunmen have strafed the Clinton White House.
Powell, perhaps, felt especially vulnerable; there would be plenty of
white racists and black fanatics only too eager to rub him out. Mrs
Powell particularly feared for his life; when Yitzhak Rabin was gunned
down the other weekend that undoubtedly added weight to her plaints. As
a dripping gutter . . .
But still more: and this, perhaps, is a factor not sufficiently
appreciated this side of the Pond. The reality is that the Republican
Party is no longer a credible base for sensible, moderate politicians.
Over the past 30 years it has steadily succumbed to the control of
extremists, cranks, bigots, and nutters. Today it bears strange
parallels to the twilight of the Labour Party a dozen years ago. As the
Trots Party -- which was once, by the way, the left-wing party in
American politics.
I put quotation marks around ''Christian Right'' because I do not
believe that some of its most prominent officers are Christians at all.
By their fruits we are to know them. What are we to make of Oliver
North, who mercifully failed to win the governor's mansion in Virginia
last year? There is one who drapes himself in Old Glory and drips maxims
of morality -- a sometime gunrunner, a proud and self-confessed liar.
Then there is Newt Gingrich, one of the slimiest characters ever to
attain high office in Congress. The Gingrich who cuts million-dollar
deals with Rupert Murdoch (another incredible Christian, by the way).
The Gingrich who abandoned his wife as she lay dying with cancer,
putting her through a brutal divorce and trying to cut her off without a
penny.
Not to mention the televangelists, Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell; men
who have enriched themselves in the name of Christ, who have lured
thousands of Americans into abandoning the visible church for their
Sabbath-breaking, televised extravaganzas, men who beg shamelessly for
money from all manner of folk. (True Christian churches look after
themselves. Only the cults and sects beg donations from those without.)
The elements of their political creed would make Galilee weep. In the
mid-term congressional elections last year, hundreds of thousands of
''polling cards'' were distributed throughout America, guiding voters in
the assessment of a candidate's Christian credentials. The Good Guys,
Americans learned, opposed all forms of gun control. They were for low
taxes and minimal government; any candidate wanting higher taxes (though
the nation is massively in debt) was wicked. Christian Congressmen would
do their utmost to extirpate homosexuality, ban abortion, and withdraw
all welfare support from single parents.
Is this not remarkable? The Saviour said that he who lived by the
sword would die by the sword, but, in His name, those guys want the old
American freedom to stockpile weapons of maiming and murder enshrined in
law. Scripture abounds in demands for social justice, of condemnation
for the oppression of the poor. But what have these professing
Christians to say about employee rights, health and safety measures,
welfare schemes, or a statutory minimum wage? Puff all.
''Owe no man,'' says scripture, and if we are in debt we are meant to
pay it off -- but the Christian right wants tax cuts, and more tax cuts,
and is very shy with proposals for reducing public spending; only this
week it is now apparent it has no ideas for cutting the federal deficit.
Abortion is an issue more complex in law than in morality. Here we see
the dangers of deploying the state in the cause of personal ethics. To
my mind, abortion is only justified if the carriage of a child to term
threatens the mother's life or permanent health; perhaps, too, in cases
where the unborn child is so hideously deformed it has no hope of
post-natal survival.
So much for morality; so amending the abortion law is fraught with
danger. We must confront the world as it is. The alternative to
thousands of babies dying in legal abortion would be thousands of women
(and the babies) dying in illegal, back-street terminations. There are
no simple answers here, and the Christian right -- in its obsessive
clarity on this issue -- is terrifying to behold.
And so on. Yet this rabble are now in charge of America's principal
party of opposition. And only those candidates prepared to pander to
their prejudices -- like that Roman Catholic bigot Patrick Buchanan --
will enjoy an easy primary ride next spring. Already such Republican
moderates as Jack Kemp and James Baker have decided to hold their
presidential ambitions for the time being. Now Colin Powell has joined
them, not prepared to brave the anti-abortion, queer-bashing,
tax-slashing simpletons who dominate the Republican agenda (and a good
few closet racists among them).
That American Christianity has reached this fatuous, materialistic
parody of the Gospel is ineffably sad.
It is important to point out, in conclusion, that American Christians
have suffered much provocation in recent decades. Militant humanists,
just as charmless and no less extreme, have done their best to
de-Christianise what was, in the days of the Founding Fathers, an
intended Christian commonwealth. The law forbidding denominational
establishment has been twisted in the courts to bar any sort of
Christian expression in public institutions. School prayer has been
illegal for 30 years. Every month brings news of some further addled
lawsuit, invariably backed by the so-called American Civil Liberties
Union, to remove a town-hall Christmas tree here, ban Christian students
from meeting in a college there, prevent schoolchildren from being
taught anything about the Bible anywhere.
America's culture, alas, remains violent, confrontational and
impassioned. Too many of her Christians have been sucked into her
national weakness for intolerance and me-firstism. So a most able
presidential candidate has ducked aside and, bizarrely, in November of
next year the discerning Christian, the one who stops and thinks
Biblically, should hold his nose and vote for Clinton.

CARLISLE-based Carr's Milling Industries has emerged smiling from a
record year which saw pre-tax profits rising 95% to #2.85m on turnover
of #85.8m.
The agriculture division benefited from the Massey Ferguson
distributorships where the number of outlets is being increase this year
from seven to nine. Animal feeds had a difficult time with milk supplies
for part of the season being above quota.
But chief executive Chris Holmes is more optimistic for the current
year with prices likely to increase thanks to a dry summer reducing
forage and milk more back into balance.
There was a larger contribution from the Crystalyx feed blocks and
there will be some benefit this time round from the recent #1.2m
purchase of Ayr based fertiliser manufacturerScotphos. Farm retail sales
were buoyant.
Milling profits were under pressure because of high wheat prices
although the joint venture company with Kears which took over
Robertsons(Bakers) brought in a larger than epected intial profit. But
flour prices should have bottomed with the major millers taking a more
realistic approach.
The engineering ativities achieve a 10% margin after the
reorganisation an through using new premises.
The dividend total has been raised 37% to 8.5p with a 6.5p final to
putthe shares at 300p on a 2.8% yield. Analysts are penilling in profits
for 1995-95 of #3.5m for a price earnings ratio of about 12 -- Carr is
now on the acquisition trail which should excite greater interest in the
company.

SIR BRYAN NICHOLSON, the president of the Confederation of British
Industry, does not lose his temper easily. He came near to it yesterday,
thereby illuminating one of the great untold truths of British politics
as 1995 draws to a close. As pragmatists through and through, British
businessmen and women see their future and profits in Europe. This
should not be a surprise to those who have followed the debate on Europe
within British industry over the past year. It has been characterised by
common sense and a desire to make decisions informed by fact rather than
rhetoric. But the rhetoric of the right, those Sir Bryan described
alliteratively yesterday as the ''frenzied fringe'', has continued to
froth and bubble, with Mr John Redwood speaking at a fringe meeting of
the CBI annual conference and insisting that Britain trades in the world
and not just Europe.
Mr Redwood makes an obvious point but Sir Bryan is unimpressed. He is
right to remind his members that the joint CBI/British Chambers of
Commerce survey on which we commented last week made clear the desire of
British business to take a positive attitude to Europe; that most of
those polled were in favour of a single currency; and that a majority
believed that Tory bickering over Europe was damaging the national
interest. That last point is a serious charge and it is not one which
any Euro-sceptic has seen fit to address thus far. Sir Bryan and his
colleagues are not blinkered on the subject of Europe but have made a
sober assessment of where the interests of British business lie. On the
single currency they are mostly in favour but believe in keeping all
options open, which is surely the sensible way to proceed.
The CBI has taken sensible measures to prevent the European debate
being hijacked by the extremists; would that the Government had done the
same within its own bailiwick. Nevertheless, there is another fable from
the right which has grown fashionable recently and which needs to be
nailed. Suddenly the Commonwealth is hailed as a good partner for
business, following closely on exhortations to businessmen to delve into
the Pacific Rim countries. Of course there is business to be done there,
but the facts are that British business is investing heavily in Europe
and will continue to do so. Figures show that the rate at which British
businesses have invested in European nations is far above that of
investment in the rest of the world, including the Commonwealth. Britain
is part of Europe, geographically and economically. No amount of wishful
thinking by those who do not like this fact can alter reality, and for
that we should be grateful.

AN administrative whim of the Scottish Prison Service has turned star
striker Duncan Ferguson into a sweeper. Alas, according to word reaching
the Diary from the inner fastness of Barlinnie Prison, the #4m player is
not scoring in his new position.
Fellow inmates of Ferguson, recently kicked into touch for three
months for assault while playing for Rangers, are apparently nonplussed
by his unusual style of mopping up.
Sporting the red and white shirt of the B team -- it takes time to get
into First Division-status blue and white at the Bar-L -- the Everton
hero has been given the task of keeping spotless some of the metal
staircases that serve the inmates on their way between the wee palaces
that are their cells and the ground-floor snooker tables.
These experts on the game of two halves have marvelled at the speed
with which Ferguson rockets the mop-head into the back of the bucket,
been dazzled by his firm control of the disinfectant, cheered his
powerful attack on the sullied stair treads, and roared approval at his
go-for-gold demeanor.
What they do not understand is why he works from the bottom up,
stepping on each clean tread as he ascends, thus scoring, as it were, a
series of own goals. Some prison experts, many with years of experience
of bucket-and-mop work, say this is not the right way to win points.
Happy ship
GOOD news for Scottish Tories, recently put on General Election alert
by no less than Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind who has discovered --
as recently reported by the Diary -- that the big day is now no more
that 18 months away at most.
Unlike the deep gloom at the Conservatives' Smith Square power centre
in London, overdraft on the increase, support on the decrease, and
morale run firmly aground by director of communications Hugh Colver, who
last week jumped ship -- but not before throwing a hand grenade into the
scuppers -- all is sweetness and light at the Scottish Tories'
headquarters bunker in Leith.
Cause of the buoyant atmosphere among Scotland's True Blue is jolly
Jacqui Low, two years at the helm of the party's media and communication
department and thus Caledonian opposite number of the defected Colver
who felt unable to gird his loins for the electoral battle ahead.
Besieged by callers anxious about the steadfastness of the crew at the
Scottish Conservatives' dockside HQ, Jacqui -- never knowingly a member
of the Boys' Brigade -- has been kept busy hoisting party esprit with
the declaration: ''My bum is still on my seat. We are straining every
nerve and sinew towards our ultimate goal . . . ready, aye ready.'' For
the duration, so to speak.
Going straight
A ''FIRST'' on the M8 that will be of interest to those thousands of
motorists who daily slalom between Edinburgh and Scotland's second city.
Early on Sunday there were no traffic cones. No kidding -- no cones. For
those who cannot believe their eyes, just like the Diary on Sunday
morning, we will repeat that . . . NO CONES.
Nappy days
FROM Edinburgh's New Town wealthy and the artistically active in the
West End of Glasgow comes excited chatter about a new organisation which
aims to ease the tedium of child care, leaving more time for an anxious
chat about the state of the rice crop in Chad and attendance at gala
nights with Pavarotti.
''Emergency Mums -- the Nanny Service'' has produced its first
newsletter aimed at linking ''nannies and nursery nurses all over
Lothian and Glasgow who may frequently feel lonely and overworked.''
Nappy rash, vomit, and temper tantrums to one side, the newsletter
runs a humour column. Examples -- the mum who asked if she had to pay
her nanny while her baby was asleep: the girl who sought a change of
career with a nanny agency using the qualities necessary in her present
job . . . feeding lions at the zoo.
Sad reflection
TWO minutes' silence there may have been but times have changed in the
land fit for heroes. Poppy collection boxes have all but disappeared
from shop counters in the centre of the capital in the run-up to
Armistice Sunday because gangs of Artful Dodgers -- some no older than
nine -- fed their Tizer and crisps habit by snatch and run tactics.
Fizzing
BOSSES at Barr's, the Glasgow soft-drink firm that consistently pays
the best price for used girders in good condition, are less that riveted
by Coca-Cola's #100,000 bung to the city's Shine On extravaganza of
Christmas excitements that will see Coke's corporate colours -- red and
white -- splashed about wherever shoppers work up a drouth as their
plastic approaches meltdown.
Consumption of Barr's Irn Bru and rival Coca-Cola is level pegging in
Scotland with each slaking 25% of the nation's thirst for carbonated
waters. But Barr's chairman, Robin Barr, is laid back about the
Americans' Christmas offensive on home ground and unmoved by the fact
that Scotland's other national drink was not in there first with the
bawbees.
''I don't know anything about this so we can't be very worried about
it,'' he told the Diary. Carefully avoiding the use of the rival brand
name as he oversaw the delivery of fresh loads of girders, Mr Barr
explained: ''They must spend their marketing budget as they see fit. We
will not react like a petrified rabbit.''
Locals in limbo
FROM Knoydart, that great slab of land where a hardy lad may still
prove himself worthy of the maiden of his choice by running down deer
barefoot, gralloching by hand, and cooking the entrails on no more than
the heat from his adolescent sporran, word reaches the Diary of
suspended animation.
What, ask the locals, is happening to their native heath -- one time
plaything of the extravagantly skint and now languishing in the window
of an estate agent at a mere #1.5m? A bid has been made, a closing date
set and passed, new bids tendered, a new D-Day fixed -- also passed --
but still no new laird.
Wealthy theatre impresario Cameron Mackintosh has stepped centre stage
to be an angel, his bid in and chequebook open on behalf of a
conservation consortium. But, says Andrew Rettie of selling agents
Strutt and Parker, the Mackintosh bid is only one of ''several''. How
many? ''Several.''
Two directors of the anxious-to-depart Knoydart Peninsula Co Ltd, its
plans to run a centre to re-shape delinquent youth now in the
wilderness, sat up with Andrew Rettie in Edinburgh until close to
midnight weighing up the pros and cons of the offers on the table.
The distilled wisdom of the late-night session will be put before the
Knoydart Peninsula board in London some time this week after which the
good folk of Knoydart will know whether or not the future will enter
stage left.

IVORY &amp; Sime's British Assets Trust has raised more than #70m from the
sale of shares and warrants in Investors Capital Trust, which it
previously controlled.
British Assets has reduced its stake in Investors Capital from 65.2%
to just under 40% and will keep it at this level for at least 12 months.
British Assets is a #671m trust with investments in the UK, the US and
Far East. The reduction of its stake in Investors Capital gives it more
scope to invest directly in UK equities.
Ivory &amp; Sime director Gordon Neilly said Investors Capital now
represented just over 20% of British Assets' portfolio, down from 35%
previously.
''British Assets is international and to have so much tied up did not
give us sufficient flexibility,'' he said.
The sale of Investors Capital shares was in line with last year's
strategic decision to reorganise British Assets by reducing the yield of
its portfolio and slimming down its stake in the subsidiary trust.
British Assets placed 33 million Investors Capital growth shares with
institutional investors and a further 29.5 million in an offshore bond
administered and underwritten by Albany International, a subsidiary of
Metropolitan Life Insurance. This two stage operation raised #67.5m.
British Assets gained a further #2.75m from the sale of Investors
Capital warrants. These confer the right to buy shares in the trust at a
fixed price in the future.
Mr Neilly said British Assets had exceeded its original target of
raising #40m from the share placing in order to reduce its stake in
Investors Capital to less than 50%.

How do our international competitors stay ahead?
Dick Louden on the secrets of Japanese success
IF we want to emulate Japan's remarkable industrial success, we have
to start by cultivating a learning society.
In a report from the National Commission on Education, Mike Oram,
director of human resource consultants Enman Ltd, explains that learning
in Japan is culturally prescribed. The learning process is highly
traditional. Schools concentrate on memory development, aimed at
regurgitating information and passing exams. Young people supplement
their education in crammer evening classes.
Conformity of behaviour and uniformity of dress are high on the social
agenda. Tight controls are exercised by the Ministry of Education and
there is little room for flexibility in the curriculum.
More young people remain in education longer than in any other
country. Employers receive a steady supply of highly-educated labour,
notably in mathematics. Yet, while school leavers and graduates have
excellent knowledge, their analytical ability and social skills are more
limited.
In training recruits, Japanese companies usually consider
organisational needs rather than individual aspirations. In Britain,
employee appraisals normally determine the shape of training programmes.
The Japanese government sponsors small and medium-sized companies in
areas like investment in advanced technology. However, most Japanese
employers accept basic responsibility for training.
The main strategy is on-the-job training (On-JT), developed after
World War Two because it was cheaper. There are costs -- training occurs
in ''real time'' -- but, by proceeding in small incremental steps, costs
are substantially reduced. The steps are:
* The instructor performs a task
* Trainees perform it under supervision
* Trainees work on their own, bringing the output to the instructor
for comment
* Trainees work independently, except when problems arise
* Trainees progress to more difficult work
In itself, this is not new. However, it is applied over many
occupations, not just the shop floor. It has been used with graduates
performing tasks similar to those of a secretary. There are therefore
few secretaries in Japan, the attitude being ''Why waste good training
resources on dispensable clerical staff?''
Managers allocate more than 20% of their time to training. Most On-JT
is directed towards industrial change. Nearly twice as much technical
training is focused on future as on present needs -- the opposite of the
United Kingdom.
Despite the emphasis on On-JT, the Japanese supplement it with
off-the-job training (Off-JT). This ''broadens'' employees (making them
work more flexibly) and ''deepens'' their skills in specialist,
professional and technical jobs.
The ''broadening'' tends to be provided within the company, sometimes
using external training resources. Key issues on which Off-JT is
currently focusing are technical innovation, information technology and
the ageing of the workforce.
Japan thus uses high rates of participation in education to create a
base for continuous learning. In this country we do not sustain learning
mechanisms, concentrating resources on early learning.
We could also adopt the Japanese On-JT approach by locating
responsibility for learning with line managers. The caveat is that these
processes are best introduced at a time of little national change in
vocational education. It is difficult to remember such a time in this
country.

THE Government is set to ban the pornographic satellite channel TV
Erotica from British screens, National Heritage Secretary Virginia
Bottomley said yesterday.
The Swedish-based station, which advertises itself as ''Europe's
hottest adult movie channel'' shows films featuring uninhibited sex.
People in Britain with certain satellite dishes already can view the
channel, which is beamed from the Eutelsat satellite, if they pay #139
for a smart card for their receivers.
The smart card is advertised in sex magazines
Mrs Bottomley said that action to ban the channel was on the way.
''I've been very concerned about that channel and have been taking
steps. I'll be able to make further announcements before long.
''We live in a world with a multi-media. That's exciting. It brings
great opportunities. But with that freedom must come responsibilities.
''When there is material going out which is damaging to children's
health and wellbeing, then there are necessary powers that need to be
taken.''
The Government can effectively ban TV Erotica from British screens by
making it an offence to sell the smart cards in Britain and to advertise
or publish information about the service.
Similar action was taken in 1993 to ban the porno station Red Hot
Dutch from Britain, but viewers can still see the channel by purchasing
the smart card on the Continent.
The tough action taken by the British Government against Red Hot Dutch
put the original station out of business, as it lost vast sums of money
when it appealed to the European courts about Britain's action.
Similar stations, such as TV 69, have started broadcasting from the
Continent, but have made a deliberate decision not to market their
smartcards or advertise in Britain.
The Independent Television Commission, which monitors the output of
all satellite stations beamed into Britain, urged the Government to take
action against Red Hot Dutch, and in March drew attention to material
broadcast on TV Erotica, so the Government could start action to ban it.
On October 19, the ITC wrote to the National Heritage Department
urging action against another satellite station, the French-owned
Rendez-Vous channel.

Despite the doubts of 22 bank managers, Tom Cameron is creating a
popular fast track to relaxation -- and many jobs. Geraldine Abrahams
reports
WITH a few exceptions, most job creation over the next few years is
likely to take place in the light manufacturing and service industries.
The leisure industry is one of the fastest expanding areas, growing to
meet the needs of those people who now find themselves with more
flexible timetables, and with more opportunity to use their free time.
A further impetus for growth in leisure facilities has been the
universal recognition of stress in the workplace today in terms of
absenteeism, low morale and reduced productivity, and the need to find
ways of combating its effects.
At corporate and individual level, increasing numbers of people have
taken up sports which offer physical and mental challenge.
For the entrepreneur, such a marketplace is a dream come true, but as
is so often the case, some of Scotland's most exciting and successful
businesses are started not through a recognition of market needs but
simply because the creator of the enterprise believes in them.
Five years ago, Tom Cameron was the manager of a grain company at
Gladsmuir, East Lothian. Today, a few hundred yards down the road, he
runs what is poised to become the most comprehensive karting facility in
the UK, and possible even in Europe.
As a motor-sport enthusiast, while he enjoys everything from stock car
racing to Formula I, he never had the opportunity to pursue a formal
career in sport. When he was asked to find a use for an empty grain shed
in 1992, he decided to try out an idea that had been hatching in his
mind -- to set up an indoor karting facility which he was to call
Karting Indoors.
He sub-let the shed, compiled a business plan, and went in search of
funding. Persuading other people that you have a winner is never easy
and he was turned down by 22 banks before finally securing #60,000
initial funding.
He moved his operation to a larger site only minutes from the A1,
built a new indoor track and, at the beginning of this month, opened a
new 900-metre international standard outdoor karting track. Karting
Indoors has now been re-named The National Pro-Karting Centre.
Karting -- or go-karting as it used to be called -- has been the
training ground for many of the UK's most successful motor-sport
champions, including John Clelland, David Coulthard and Allan McNish,
all of whom have practised at Karting Indoors and commended its
professionalism.
''Yesterday we took a booking from Dario Franchitti, former Scottish
and UK Karting champion who joined Jackie Stewart's son Paul's racing
team for two years before driving for Mercedes in the German Touring Car
Championship'' says Tom.
''Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, David Coulthard -- most of the Formula
I racers -- have come up through karting. It is highly competitive and,
with so many karts on the track, the reaction time has to be very fast.
There is a natural progression in to motor sports. The eight- and
nine-year-olds we have racing in the cadet karts all want to be Formula
I drivers.''
All the children in the club go through a series of lessons which
concentrate on the safety angle.
The customer/client base is well balanced in terms of gender. With the
growth in corporate business, especially in the financial sector, many
more women are participating, and that should be reflected in an
increasing number of women going into motor-racing.
Louise Aitken Walker, Britain's first woman world rally champion, has
visited the club and Tom's two daughters are both members of the Diamond
Dogs Racing Team.
Tom and his wife Janice originally come from service backgrounds --
his family was involved in the hotel trade in Edinburgh -- and their
managerial and customer-based skills have been very helpful in setting
up the new business.
Initially, Janice was the only full-time employee, although there were
four part-time marshals at that stage, all paid the basic minimum wage.
Starting with such a small base has allowed him to grow gradually and
to implement his training programme on an experience/hands-on basis. He
has personally overseen track design, safety measures, and the training
of personnel, making a conscious effort to blend a laid-back atmosphere
with the discipline of safety.
He immediately sought accreditation, to set down guidelines by which
the company could operate, and the RAC approved the original indoor
track. He will seek further RAC accreditation for the outdoor circuit.
Membership of The National Karting Association and the Pro-Karting
Association followed and, while the company uses their health and safety
guidelines as a minimum standard for operation, the aim is to operate at
a higher level.
The sport has attracted two types of employee -- those who enjoy
working in a fun atmosphere and those who see it as a route into serious
motor sport.
Looking back to his business plan, Tom has already taken on more staff
than he had originally anticipated. From an initial staff of only one
full-time employee, there are 15 people at the moment and that will rise
to 25 or 30 by next summer.
These jobs will be across the board and will include
administration-type roles which will expand when the new permanent
offices are built in the spring, as well as further openings for
mechanics and track marshals.
As race director, Tom Cameron is ultimately responsible for all the
training, although once the outdoor track is up and running, he will
delegate training to the track manager or a track marshal.
While LEEL, the local enterprise company, provided some funding for
the initial track, it has not funded the extension. However, there is
the promise of help with training provision and this is good news since
a family business can create administrative structures that are not
compatible with bigger operations -- and this operation is set for
further growth.
Once the outdoor track has been developed and accredited, The National
Pro-Karting Centre will be able to run one-off events for the RAC as
well as national events.
There are also plans to develop the market further afield and company
teams, kitted out in promotional gear, have been to various karting
events in Europe -- including Le Mans -- where they have worked hard
encouraging the Europeans to come to Scotland.
Tom Cameron could not have envisage that the interest in the sport
could have grown so swiftly. Ten years ago, there were less than six
karting centres in the UK. Today there are over 100, and interest from
the corporate sector has been growing a pace as companies look for
entertainment activities which offer an alternative to shooting, fishing
and golf.
Success so far has meant working seven days a week to get his business
enterprise up and running; but with more staff and further delegation,
Tom and Janice might just manage a holiday before the end of the decade
-- that's a family business for you!

'The big plus is that all golfers are welcome at a sensible price.'
LAGGANMORE, a mile outside Portpatrick on the south-west extremity of
Scotland, has arrived on the golfing scene so quietly that few are aware
it even exists.
No Monarch's or Loch Lomond-style fanfares have announced every step,
but exist it certainly does, and five years after the first turf was
cut, 18 holes came into play in June this year.
This is not intended to be a world-class course like its
contemporaries, yet at 6000 yards at its full length, it is still a
serious test built at a fraction of the cost -- and the big plus is that
unlike others, all golfers are welcome at a sensible price.
The greens might be a few degrees short of pure velvet and many rough
edges may be apparent, but already it is standing the crucial test of a
good course -- one that draws you back in the unfailing belief that next
time, you will get the better of it.
One hole stands out on this Nigel Williams-designed course which makes
full use of the land as it lies in the traditional Scottish style, the
as-yet unnamed 476-yard, par-5 seventh, requiring two good hits into the
prevailing south-west blast, clearing several rock outcrops, and an iron
over the Craigach Burn fronting the green.
An official opening is contemplated in the spring, but already there
is a certain amount of lore to the course, which has been hewn out of
rough farmland by the owner, Edgar Hornby, and his sons Peter and
Stephen.
Three years ago entrepreneur John Henderson from Donaghadee, directly
across the North Channel in County Down, made the trip over to inspect
additional farmland which was up for sale. He didn't like the land, but
was taken by the golf course which was not in the shop window.
The octogenarian, a former captain of Killymoon, made Hornby an offer
he couldn't refuse for a 50% share, against the advice of his wife,
Maud. Sadly, he died earlier this year leaving the stake to his widow,
who has since given her blessing for the venture to continue.
There also have been a few famous visitors, like a group of
professionals en route to this year's Senior British Open in Portrush,
who stopped there to use the only driving range facility in the area.
One was thought to have been a New Zealander, but the owners are
uncertain whether it was Bob Charles; they couldn't say whether he was a
left-hander.
Pop star Alvin Stardust was definitely there. There are witnesses who
will verify that he went round twice. The proprietor was working on the
course at the time and admits he wouldn't have known Alvin from Adam.
Okay, so Edgar Hornby, a very much down-to-earth character as befits a
farmer, can't tell Bob Charles from a pop star, but one thing he has
learned a lot about over the last five years is golf course
construction.
The cost for the entire venture, he estimates, is an all inclusive #1m
for a clubhouse -- which can accommodate 400 people and already is
heavily booked for weddings and other non-golfing functions -- floodlit
driving range, five chalets, access road, and the course itself, where
the greens have been constructed to exacting modern standards. Grants
totalling #60,000 were awarded by local enterprise companies.
There has been an additional cost in hard graft by the Hornby men who,
for example, have removed 10,000 tons of rubble from their on-site
quarry to fill in an area of bog at the 360-yard seventeenth constructed
down a long gully and which promises to be another feature hole when it
is completed (it is presently being played as a par 3).
From the elevated tee, players must opt whether to play an iron to the
first level or go for a long one all the way down to leave a short
pitch.
Membership costing #75 a year stands at 80 and there have been 2000
visitor rounds at #10 for 18 holes since June at the course which is
expected to have a standard scratch of 69 or 70 when it is assessed,
making it longer than the neighbouring Dunskey course, but shorter than
Stranraer.
The course is at a height of 300 feet and boasts views across to
Ireland and the mountains of Mourne.
Williams, a civil engineer and a six-handicap member at Bothwell
Castle, meanwhile is progressing his career as a golf course architect.
Following his work at Gretna which led directly to Lagganmore, he is
designing a nine-hole course at Belford, Northumberland, with other
possibles in the pipeline through the company he has set up, Fairbanks
Associates.
There is now an open invitation to professionals and top amateurs to
play Lagganmore. Hornby said: ''We think we have constructed a fair test
of golf and we would now like to hear comments from established
players.'' Bob Charles included, one presumes.

THE rules governing undersea workings may be changed following the
current investigation into munitions dumping in the North Channel
between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Scottish Office Environment Minister the Earl of Lindsay said that
this would be one of the options considered once all the evidence from
various surveys had been gathered and analysed.
He was speaking before embarking with the survey vessel Culpea from
Ardrossan to see the type of survey work which will be carried out over
the next 10 days in the area around the Beaufort's Dyke dumping ground.
Left behind angry and disappointed on the quayside was Labour MP
George Foulkes, who had wanted to join the short voyage to add to his
knowledge as a campaigner against the dumping and its recent damaging
effects.
The Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley MP said: ''I am furious at what
amounts to a snub by an unelected Scottish Office Minister, not just to
me but to my parliamentary colleagues in Scotland who were happy to have
me speak for them and report back to them on the voyage.
''When I asked to go out with the ship, I was told it was full up but
now I see the Minister's press officer going down the gangway.
''I could easily have his place but, presumably, he is there to avoid
any more embarrassing gaffes.''
Mr Foulkes tomorrow will raise an adjournment debate in the Comons,
during which the latest controversy -- caused by by the washing up of
thousands of wartime phosphoros sticks apparently dumped near Beaufort's
Dyke -- will be discussed.
He added: ''I am astonished that the Minister is continuing to adhere
to the line that the British Gas pipeline may have had something to do
with it.
''The evidence is now overwhelming and a stop must be put to any
further commercial work until we know the full picture.''
Lord Lindsay said: ''It may be that one advantage of the past few
weeks and of the surveys which are no being carried out will be that we
will be able to look closely, along with colleagues from other
departments, at the way commercial operations involving disturbance of
the seabed are carried out.
''I remain satisfied that this is the way to go about gathering
information and finding out what the next step should be. Public safety
has not been and never will be anything less than our number one
priority.''  Mr Derek Saward, senior scientific officer from the Marine
Laboratory in Aberdeen, demonstrated to Lord Lindsay what work will be
carried out using video cameras, seabed sampling and water gathering
equipment.
He said: ''There is strong circumstantial evidence that work on the
pipeline may have disturbed munitions but nothing is proven. That is
part of our remit but the other part is a survey to ensure that marine
life is not being harmed in the area.''

SAM Torrance was certain that his ball at the final hole on the last
day of the World Cup of Golf at Mission Hills in China was picked up by
a spectator. That being the case, shouldn't he have been allowed a free
drop at the estimated point where the ball came to rest under Rule 18-1
rather than be required to go back to the tee with a one-shot penalty
under Rule 27-1?
No. The explanation is given in Decision 18-1/1 which states: ''To
treat a ball which cannot be found as moved by an outside agency rather
than lost (Rule 27), there must be reasonable evidence to that effect.
All available testimony should be considered. In the absence of such
evidence, the ball must be treated as lost.''
According to reports, Torrance hit his ball over a hill and out of
sight. There was not one witness who saw the ball at rest, and a full
search was unsuccessful.

Berlin
A BERLIN court yesterday postponed the trial of East Germany's last
hard-line communist leader, Egon Krenz, 58, charged with the
manslaughter of citizens fleeing over the Berlin Wall after his lawyer
objected that the judges were biased.
Krenz's lawyer said three of the five judges had effectively prejudged
the case by agreeing last week to upgrade the charges against Krenz and
five other members of the once-mighty Communist Party Politburo.
The judges decided to postpone the trial, where the six men face a
total of 47 manslaughter charges and 24 of attempted manslaughter, for a
week to allow the objections to be examined.
This trial is the most important of prosecutors' attempts to bring
East Berlin's political elite to book since the abortive trials of
long-time leader Erich Honecker and feared secret police chief Erich
Mielke.--Reuter

A PARIS court found a publicity-seeking failed writer guilty of
killing the former head of France's wartime Vichy police, which
collaborated with the Nazis, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison.
Christian Didier, 51, had earlier pleaded in court for forgiveness
from God, the Jews and the family of his victim, Rene Bousquet.
''I am drained. The horror of the crime has vaccinated me against any
other crime,'' Didier told the court on the final day of his week-long
trial on charges of slaying Bousquet in June 1993, a crime of which he
has previously boasted.
''I ask for pardon first of all from God, who said, 'Thou shalt not
kill', from the Jews, for the trial which I blocked, and from the
Bousquet family, deprived of a father,'' Didier told the court.
He could have been sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. But
Prosecutor Christian Bilger, citing diminished psychological
responsibility, requested a relatively lenient 10 to 12 year jail term.
Didier, ruled sane by medical experts but with a history of
psychiatric disorders, shot Bousquet just months before the 84-year-old
former police chief had himself been due to go on trial for crimes
against humanity over the deportation of Jews from France during World
War Two. -- Reuter.

THE identities of 22 Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders who tested
positive for drugs are still not known to the regimental authorities.
An Army spokesman said laboratory results were awaited in order to
double check the initial findings from the 396 soldiers who were tested.
''The unit itself does not know which individual soldiers are involved
at this stage. The process must now take its course and they will remain
on normal duties until a decision is made,'' he said.
Once the results are confirmed, the soldiers will be called before
their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Graham.
''They will be dealt with under internal disiciplinary procedures. It
is not a court martial and it will not necessarily lead to dismissal
from the service.
''The commanding officer has the discretion to give a soldier another
chance, if it is a first offence and where it is felt he was young and
inexperienced and badly influenced,'' the spokesman said.
The 5% rate of positive tests is believed to be the highest recorded
in any regiment since compulsory drug-testing was introduced in January.
The Argylls are currently based at Redford Barracks in Edinburgh and
recruits are free to socialise outside. Testing revealed traces of a
variety of drugs, including cannabis, ecstasy, and amphetamines.
Dr Richard Hammersley, senior lecturer in the Behavioral Sciences
Group at Glasgow University, said yesterday that the results were not
surprising. He said they indicated about one third of the level of drug
use to be found in civilian men of the same age.
''What it does suggest is that the military are using drugs much less
than their peers. Unless things have changed very much, the Army has far
greater problems with alcohol and tobacco,'' he said.
There have been problems with the accuracy of compulsory drug-testing
and the civil liberties issues involved. In the USA, it has led to some
people switching to more harmful drugs to avoid detection of cannabis,
traces of which stay in the body for a long time.

THE sumptuous jewels of Princess Salimah Aga Khan went up for auction
yesterday to a buying frenzy clearly helped by two weeks of courtroom
drama and royal recriminations.
In a crowded salon at a luxury Geneva hotel, early lots fetched up to
eight times their pre-sale estimate as international telephone bidders
pushed the prices out of reach of all but the wealthiest local
customers.
Prince Karim Aga Khan had tried to stop the sale, saying the terms of
his divorce from the princess in March prevented her selling off the
collection.
But he lost his final appeal on Friday, allowing what auction house
Christie's say is the most splendid jewel sale since the late Duchess of
Windsor's collection went under the hammer in 1987.
The total value of the collection, even after the withdrawal of 23
minor lots that a Geneva appeals court said should be sold to the Aga
Khan, had been estimated at around $15 million.
But from the very first lot, when an aquamarine torsade necklace
estimated at $2,600 fetched more than five times that, it was clear that
Princess Salimah, a British-born former fashion model, need have no more
money fears.
Friends of the 54-year-old princess say she is selling off the jewels
to ensure her financial security.
''I had been hoping to buy something but after the first lot I thought
I'd just watch,'' said schoolteacher Bianca Gabrielli. ''It's no
surprise though, after all that publicity.''
Among other early lots, a suite of freshwater pearl and three-coloured
gold jewellery by Poiray -- estimated at $5200 -- fetched $23,000 and a
tortoise-shell and ruby evening bag by Bulgari fetched $22,000, eight
times its estimated price.
One young Swiss woman, who didn't want to be named, paid more than
$5000 for an 18-carat charm bracelet by Cavelti and said: ''I could have
brought it at a jeweller, but the fact that it belonged to the princess
gave it added value. She's a beautiful woman and a great personality.''
A Christie's spokeswoman said that the first 140 minor lots had
fetched 1.8 million Swiss francs ($1.57 million), more than twice
pre-sale estimates.
She expected the larger pieces up for sale on Monday evening to do
well too, but not to exceed their estimates so easily. The final lot in
the sale was to be the ''Begum Blue'', a 13.78 carat heart-shaped deep
blue diamond set in a diamond pendant necklace valued at $7m.--Reuter.

A MAN told a court yesterday he ''admitted'' abducting his friend and
pointing an imitation gun at police only in order to get his girlfriend
freed.
Brian Martin, 38, said he was detained with his girlfriend Julie Bryce
when he arrived in Portsmouth after months on the run.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard they were brought to Fife and he
gave a voluntary statement to detectives at Dunfermline. Detectives
strongly disputed that ''a deal'' had been struck with Martin over his
statement.
Detective Chief Inspector John Nicholson, 52, said in evidence that Ms
Bryce had faced a charge over harbouring Martin but she was released on
the instructions of the procurator-fiscal.
In his statement, Martin said he had presented a fake firearm at
police outside a bar in Ballingry, Fife, abducting and robbing a friend,
and a raid on a building society in Oban.
Martin, described as a prisoner, has gone on trial after denying
taking part in a #8500 wages robbery at Glencraig, in Fife, on September
25, 1992.
He has also denied assaulting and abducting bookmaker Joseph Campbell,
36, and his wife, Catherine, and robbing them of #2000, and assaulting
police constables Neil Stewart and John Hughes in Ballingry by
threatening them with a sawn-off shotgun.
Martin has admitted a raid on a branch of the Yorskhire Building
Society, in George Street, Oban, when a knife was presented at employees
and they were robbed of cash on November 24 last year.
The trial continues.

THE White House is discussing possible further sanctions against
Nigeria following the hangings of nine minority rights activists last
Friday, an administration official said today.
''We are conferring with allies about what additional measures we
might be able to take,'' the official said.
''We certainly are not excluding anything,'' he added, but declined to
outline the options being reviewed.
A senior White House official said on Friday an oil embargo was not
under consideration.
A decision could be made later today, said another administration
official, who added that the State Department outlined options earlier
this year in preparation for ''this kind of horrible event''.
Human rights pressure groups, including TransAfrica and Human Rights
Watch, were meeting in Washington to discuss what action to take, an
official at Human Rights Watch said.
The US recalled its envoy to Nigeria and imposed an arms embargo to
protest the execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others from the
oil-producing Ogoni area.
A European Commission spokesman said in Brussels that the the EU
executive would hold a special meeting tomorrow to discuss stronger
sanctions against Nigeria.
Meanwhile, the British Government has said it wants to talk to oil
giant Shell about its investment plans in Nigeria, while a German lobby
group has called for a boycott of the Anglo-Dutch concern's products.
A Europe-wide boycott in June forced Shell, one of the world's biggest
companies, to make an embarrassing U-turn and abandon plans to sink the
Brent Spar platform.

THE first elected leader of the Banking, Insurance, and Finance Union
(Bifu) yesterday urged Labour leader Tony Blair to back the referral to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of the proposed Lloyds-TSB
link-up.
Mr Ed Sweeney, from Merseyside, who will take over when Mr Leif Mills
retires next spring, also warned that Bifu was likely to become more
belligerent if it was excluded from decision-making processes in an
industry which had shed around 115,000 jobs over the past five years.
Labour has held back from joining the Liberal Democrats and SNP in
calling for the merger to be referred. Bifu has warned that the merger
could cost a further 10,000 jobs.
Mr Sweeney has said the planned merger is ''against the interest of
customers and staff and will be bad for the economy. It will do nothing
for sensible competition.''

UNITED States visas and passports will only be issued in emergencies
from tomorrow barring last-minute resolution of a budget dispute between
President Bill Clinton and Congress, the State Department said today.
But, despite the threatened closing of much of the US government at
midnight, Bosnia and other key negotiations will continue at full
strength, spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
''We simply can't stop the world. That may be the view of some on
Capitol Hill but it's certainly not the view of any pragmatic or
realistic person,'' Burns told a news briefing.
However, that still means about 800,000 government workers can stay
home tomorrow.
For those zealous employees who would work for free, there will be
strict orders for the non-essential to go home because of a law against
volunteering for the federal government.
Exceptions are for those offices considered crucial to the operation
of the country. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake will be in with
about half his staff.
The Republican Congress polished off a bill to continue operations
temporarily, but the president promised to veto it.
The bill, a ''continuing resolution,'' that would provide revenue for
the next month or so, also contains a list of provisions that the
president utterly rejects. It imposes a rise in Medicare insurance
premiums and would allow government departments only 60% of their
current funding.
House and Senate will remain in session until midnight, to allow for
last-minute negotiations to avert the shut-down, but first both sides
had to prove their determination, Congress by passing the bill and
president by vetoing it.
Early this morning, Mr Clinton vetoed another crucial piece of
legislation, which would raise the limit the government is permitted to
borrow. That bill, too, is beset with addenda that the president will
not accept. The Treasury claims that it can juggle the books for a few
more days or weeks before the US defaults on its debts.
Museums and monuments in Washington will be closed and other
departments will arbitrarily send home workers deemed inessential.
National defence and welfare payments will continue to go out, but
those who reach retirement age or have other reasons for joining the
rolls will have to wait.
Congress has passed, and the president has signed, two of the many
appropriations bills, for the department of agriculture and for military
construction. So farmers and people building bases will proceed as
usual.
The shut-down will probably not last very long. It has happened often
enough before, though usually over weekends with the least disruption
possible. Congress is already showing signs of nervousness, and the
chances are that it will buckle under the pressure and accept the
president's terms for both measures.
Mr Clinton and the Democrats are doing well in the polls, because they
are succeeding in painting the Republicans as the party that intends to
demolish Medicare, the health insurance system for the elderly. That
view of things would be fatal to the Republicans if it cannot be
corrected before next year's election.
So, after more midnight debate, the government will probably be
allowed to continue while the budget and appropriations bills are pushed
through, and the debt ceiling will be raised, without any addenda, to
see us through the next month.
But the underlying dispute will be merely postponed. Republicans are
determined to enforce their proposal for balancing the budget by 2002,
and the president is equally determined to do it his way. If this crisis
is resolved this week, it will probably resume in full force before the
end of the month.

The dollar slumped in early trading but managed a dramatic recovery on

Jenin
ISRAEL began fulfilling slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's peace
legacy today by pulling troops out of the West Bank city of Jenin to end
28 years of occupation.
Palestinians danced and shouted ''God is Great'' at dawn when the last
15 Israeli jeeps pulled out of military headquarters under PLO escort.
Palestinians rushed in. Soldiers waved goodbye as the jeeps turned left
for Israel.
''Without a doubt this day crowns the work of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin who lost his life working for peace,'' Palestinian police chief
Nasr Yousef said after Israeli and PLO officers shook hands to complete
the handover.
It was the first transfer of a West Bank city since Rabin and PLO
leader Yasser Arafat signed a peace deal in Washington on September 28
to expand Palestinian self-rule launched last year beyond the Gaza Strip
and Jericho.
Arafat, returning to Gaza from Jericho, praised acting Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres for continuing to implement the self-rule deal.
''This is the first step, the very important step to implement what we
had agreed upon and we have to thank Mr Peres for fulfilling his
promises to implement what we agreed upon,'' Arafat said.
''I feel like a blind man who woke up to find himself able to see,''
said Abu Ibrahim al-Yamouni, 51, a folk singer from the nearby village
of al-Yamoun.
Jenin's 40,000 residents rejoiced at the departure of the Israeli army
which had occupied the area since capturing it along with the rest of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East War. Two million
Arabs live in the territories.
Men fired their guns in the air. Palestinian flags and posters of
Arafat were everywhere. Hundreds of people took to the streets, some on
horseback. Residents joined hands and danced in the courtyard of the
military headquarters.
''Liberated Jenin is the next step towards the establishment of our
independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,'' said
Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, secretary general of Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
After the Israelis left, Palestinians from Arafat's Fatah organisation
who are wanted by the Jewish state emerged from hiding to parade in
front of the military headquarters atop civilian cars, firing pistols in
the air.
About 350 Palestinian policemen arrived from the West Bank self-ruled
town of Jericho before dawn to take charge of Jenin in the north of the
West Bank. They deployed throughout the city. Another 200 joined them
later in the day.
Amjad Tawfiq, 21, was among those to rush in to the military
headquarters. He said he had been beaten there several times by Israeli
soldiers. Asked how he felt now, Tawfiq said: ''Great, it couldn't be
better.''
Under the September peace deal, Israel agreed to leave six Palestinian
cities and parts of Hebron and to hand over civil powers and limited
security responsibilities in 450 West Bank towns, villages and refugee
camps to the PLO.
Israel and the PLO have yet to negotiate the future of Jewish
settlements, home to some 130,000 Israelis. But in Kadim, the settlement
nearest Jenin, leader David Montenegro, said settlers who opposed
Rabin's policies had begun rethinking their views since his death.
''Like all of the people of Israel, we are still feeling mourning, a
feeling of frustration. To tell the truth, I believe we too are thinking
after this event and feel that nothing is worth such a great loss,'' he
told Israel Radio.
Jenin, a stronghold of Arafat's Fatah movement, was the site of daily
clashes with Israeli troops during the uprising which erupted in 1987
against Israeli occupation. A total of 179 Palestinians from the
district died in the confrontations.--Reuter.

Ofra
A SETTLER-RABBI, surrounded by bodyguards with sub-machineguns, today
said radical Jewish clergymen had issued a death warrant against
assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
''Until it (the killing) happened they could always say, 'We don't
mean it seriously, we don't mean it literally, we are not Islamic
fundamentalists'. Now this line of thinking is impossible to accept,''
said Rabbi Yoel Bin-Nun.
Mr Bin-Nun, from the Jewish settlement of Ofra in the West Bank,
rocked religious authorities last week when he vowed to publish what he
said was a list of names of rabbis who had issued ritual rulings
effectively making Rabin a target.
He charged that rabbis, like himself opposed to handing over land to
the Palestinians, had deemed Rabin a ''pursuer'' of Jews, a ruling that
he said could be interpreted as permission to kill him in self-defence.
Asked if a death warrant had been issued against Rabin, Bin-Nun
replied: ''I wish it weren't so. (The ruling)...means a death
sentence.''
Mr Bin-Nun said that since speaking out, he has received telephone
death threats, which he is taking seriously. Six plainclothed police
guard him round the clock.
''Did you interview the stool-pigeon?'' one settler asked reporters
outside the rabbi's house.
He has refrained from going public with the radical rabbis' names and
now says he wants them to step forward themselves and for rabbinical
authorities to examine their statements on a ''spiritual plane''.
''Everyone is denying it. I am not an investigator...(and) to the best
of my knowledge, what I know, they (the police) know,'' he said.
All seven of the men arrested in connection with the November 4
killing of Rabin, including confessed assassin Yigal Amir, are religious
Jews.
One of the suspects, Avishai Raviv, head of the militant group Eyal,
said in court there had been rumours of a rabbinical ruling that killing
Rabin would be permissible because the prime minister was endangering
Israel through his peace policies.
''They conferred with their rabbis. They convinced themselves that
something like that should happen,'' Economics Minister Yossi Beilin
said.
''They wanted to stop the peace process.''
A blood-red banner headline -- ''Rabbis will be investigated,'' --
topped the front page on Monday of Israel's biggest selling newspaper,
Yedioth Ahronoth. Photographs of two bearded sages appeared alongside.
The newspaper quoted police, who have imposed a news blackout on the
investigation into Rabin's death, as saying two rabbis would be
questioned over whether they gave Jewish ritual approval for the
assassination.
Both rabbis, Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, denied the
allegation. --Reuters.

WACO:
A DRIFTER suspected of strangling or stabbing at least four women in a
cross-country string of slayings was captured today after a high-speed
chase on a rural Kentucky highway.
Glen Rogers, 35, was forced off the road by more than a half-dozen
police cruisers after a 15-mile chase that reached speeds of up to 100
mph, police said.
Rogers is wanted in the killings of at least four women -- three of
whom had reddish hair -- in California, Louisiana, Mississippi and
Florida in the past two months.
Authorities believe he may have committed four other killings.

SIX Bosnian Croats charged with war crimes at the Hague yesterday
allegedly presided over a savage side-show to Bosnia's main war in 1993,
directing militia forces who massacred Muslims in the Lasva valley.
''The crimes they are charged with were carried out on such a large
scale and widespread basis, and implemented in such a systematic
fashion, that they have effectively destroyed or removed almost the
entire Muslim civilian population in the Lasva Valley,'' the United
Nations criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia said in a statement.
Bosnian Muslims and Croats were nominal allies in the war against
separatist Bosnian Serb forces which began in April 1992 and government
troops fought alongside units of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).
But a year after the war began the HVO and its political wing, the
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), turned on the Muslim-led government and
began to fight for ''pure'' Croat territory which could be joined with
Croatia.
Two of those indicted on Monday, Dario Kordic and Tihomir Blaskic,
were prominent in the battle for central Bosnia.
Both rose to even higher positions of authority within the Bosnian
Croat community after the United States brokered a Muslim-Croat
federation agreement to end the conflict between in 1994.
Kordic, 34, is curently president of the HDZ in Bosnia and holds the
honorary rank of brigadier in the HVO.
A diminutive man usually seen wearing fatigues and thick spectacles,
Kordic once worked as a journalist before directing the defence of his
home town.-- Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Textile workers treated but safety experts can find no problems at Lanarkshire plant. Second factory in health alert</HEADLINE>

TWENTY-FIVE workers at a textile factory in Lanarkshire received
hospital treatment yesterday after complaining of breathing problems and
sickness -- on the same day that 1700 employees resumed work at a
clothing factory 13 miles away after a similar scare.
Last night Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in public health and medicine
with Lanarkshire Health Board, said hospital tests on the 25 workers
from the custom-built Delta Textiles (London) Ltd factory in Lanark had
proved negative and revealed evidence of ''classical signs of anxiety''.
Checks on heating, air, ventilation, and water, by Health and Safety
Executive officials had also proved negative. HSE officials will carry
out further checks on the factory's heating system today. The plant,
which employs about 50 people, will remain closed.
The Delta factory was closed early yesterday and 16 workers were taken
to Law Hospital, Carluke, and nine to Monklands General Hospital,
Airdrie, in a fleet of ambulances. Last night, all but one woman had
been released. She was detained in Law Hospital with an ''unrelated
chest complaint''.
One eye-witness, Mr Lindsay Jardine, 58, a local businessman,
described how some employees lay on the grass outside the factory ''in
hysterics'' with ambulancemen attending to them.
He said: ''It was a frightening sight. They were gasping for breath.
They looked really terrified. They just couldn't breathe properly. They
seemed to get better the longer they were in the fresh air.''
The complaints of breathlessness and nausea by the affected workers at
the Delta plant were similar to those suffered last week by staff at the
Larkhall textile factory run by Daks-Simpson.
The plant was closed for several days after 40 workers were taken to
hospital. They have all been released. Extensive tests carried out by
HSE officials over the weekend failed to identify what had caused their
illnesses. Experts said the cause may never be known.
Employees at the Daks-Simpson plant resumed work after being addressed
by Mr Kevin Johnson, the company's managing director in Scotland. An
expert medical team, including a doctor and nurses, was on site to give
counselling to employees.
Mr Johnson said workers at the Larkhall plant had had a ''good day''
with no interruptions to production. ''The environment and employees
will continue to be monitored by our advisers and the Health and Safety
Executive,'' he added.
Mr Barry Baker, HSE inspector, speaking outside the Lanark plant last
night, said the problems at the two factories appeared to be unrelated.
All tests on the heating, ventilation, water systems and materials used,
had so far ''proved negative.''
He said Delta, which produces T-shirts, used no chemicals -- unlike
the Daks-Simpson plant. ''The illnesses are a bit of a coincidence, but
the processes used by the two companies are completely unrelated,'' he
said.
Dr Ahmed, also speaking outside the Delta plant, said the problem at
Delta did not appear to be infectious. ''People went down with various
symptoms of a choking sensation and complained of nausea. But by the
time they went to hospital, most of them had made a good recovery,'' he
said.
The health chief said it was too early to say what had caused the
problem in Lanark, although he added: ''Obviously the fact that
something has happened in Daks has been in people's minds. When the
doctors in hospital did some tests, certainly there is evidence that
people got hyperventilation, and blood tests show classical signs of
anxiety.
''I am not saying there was not a genuine problem followed by a panic
attack. But certainly there is a lot of evidence that people did
panic.''
He explained that the problem with textile factories was that they
were extremely hot. This can lead to fainting and, he went on: ''When
one person goes down, there can be a domino effect.''
If tests by HSE officials prove negative today, the factory is likely
to reopen tomorrow under the supervision of a professional medical team
as happened at the Daks-Simpson plant.
Mr Telhami Imad, Delta's managing director, said he would try to
reassure workers today at a meeting at the factory.
Mr Ahmed added: ''Until the HSE has had the chance to investigate the
matter further and exclude all possibilities, I would not want to
prejudge the test results.''
Mr Robert Westhorp, a director of Delta Textiles, said he had no idea
what caused the problem, but insisted that he had no reason to suspect
that it was anything to do with the process used. There also was nothing
to connect the incident to the Daks factory.
Mr John Law, a chemical inspector who acts as adviser to Strathclyde
Fire Brigade, said there were ''vague similarities'' between the two
incidents.

The Swedish aid project, Ship to Bosnia, has captured the hearts of

''Five containers of aid was the original target,'' said Mr Bob Milne,

A NORTH-EAST forestry worker died after being crushed by a
tree-harvesting machine, an inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard
yesterday.
Mr Lindsay Watt, 22, of Feugh Head, Strachan, Banchory, a
self-employed forestry worker, died on July 30 this year at Candecraig
Estate, Lost, Strathdon. He suffered fatal chest injuries when a short
circuit caused the jaws on the machine to close on him.
The fatal accident inquiry heard that Mr Watt's body was found trapped
in the machine -- which was still running -- in a forested area on the
estate after he had been reported missing.
A post-mortem examination on Mr Watt gave the cause of death as crush
asphyxia resulting from chest injuries.
Woodcutter William Milne, 24, also from Strachan, told the inquiry his
colleague appeared to have been trying to replace a broken sensor on the
machine's measuring wheel.
Mr David Leslie, 31, forest manager for Scottish Woodlands Ltd, said
Mr Watt ''took a very professional attitude towards his work''.
Returning a formal determination, Sheriff David Crowe described the
accident as ''tragic''. The sheriff noted that Mr Watt had been
experienced in forestry work. He recommended that the operation of
replacing the sensor on the machine's measuring wheel should be carried
out with the engine, electrics, and hydraulics switched off.
Sheriff Crowe also recommended a proper system of training be
introduced on such complex machinery. He added that yesterday's
proceedings ''might help to obviate any such occurence happening in the
future''.

A DELEGATION from four district councils on the Moray Firth yesterday
urged the Government to give more support to oil fabrication yards in
Scotland to let them compete with foreign yards.
The councillors and officials from Inverness, Moray, Nairn, and Ross
and Cromarty District Councils met Mr George Kynoch, Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Industry, at the Scottish Office in
Edinburgh.
The delegation expressed fears that fabrication yards in Europe might
have benefited from substantial subsidies from their governments, while
the British Government seemed unwilling to intervene in this way. This
made it impossible for Scottish yards to compete on level terms, members
maintained.
The delegation wanted the Government to set up a joint working party
so that talks could take place between it and the oil-fabrication
industry. Mr Kynoch said the suggestion was premature.
He asked the local authorities to see what support was available from
Highlands and Islands Enterprise and local enterprise companies.
Councillor Ian Lawson, chairman of Moray District Council's planning
committee, said later the delegation would pursue certain lines of
inquiry suggested by Mr Kynoch and it was hoped to have a further
meeting with him.
The oil fabrication industry on the Moray Firth was in a state of
change which was reflected in three areas -- new technology, the market,
and competition from abroad.
Employment had fallen to just under 1000, in one company -- Barmac --
at two sites -- Ardersier and Nigg.
Mr Lawson said the delegation had achieved as much as they could have
expected yesterday.
A Scottish Office spokesman said later that Mr Kynoch had recognised
that the change in the offshore industry's needs was having on-shore
effects.

He said he would do anything for Rose and the children. He said he
loved his children.
KEY witness Janet Leach, giving evidence from a wheelchair in the
trial of Mrs Rosemary West, admitted yesterday that she had lied about
her contacts with the press.
Mrs Leach said she had lied to court before being taken ill on Tuesday
last week, when she had denied she had had contact with a newspaper.
The 39-year-old mother of five confessed she had reached a #100,000
agreement with Mirror Group newspapers to publish a book and for
exclusive serialisation rights.
Her boyfriend has already received #7500 and she had been given #5000
plus additional money to go towards a holiday in Somerset, for which the
newspaper group had paid.
Mrs Leach admitted her first contact with the Mirror Group was in
August last year.
She reached a verbal agreement with executives including Mr Colin
Myer, a former editor of the Mirror, for exclusive rights.
However, it was not until some months after West had hanged himself in
his cell at Winson Green Prison, Birmingham, on New Year's Day this
year, that she spoke to police about her conversations with Mr West.
Mrs Leach said yesterday that West had confessed that 20 more bodies,
whose remains have not been uncovered, were lying buried at a farm,
Winchester Crown Court heard yesterday.
In addition, he claimed his murdered first wife Rena had been involved
in the killing of their Scottish babysitter Anne McFall, whom the court
has heard was pregnant by West when she disappeared.
Mrs Leach said yeterday she continued to see West in prison in a bid
to discover the burial site of the remaining missing girls.
In dramatic evidence, after being pushed into court in a wheelchair by
a consultant physician, Mrs Leach said the 20 victims were additional to
the 12 about which the jury trying Mrs West has already heard.
Mrs West denies 10 counts of murder.
Mrs Leach admitted that West had told her totally different accounts
of the killings at 25 Cromwell Street from those he was giving police
during interviews.
Mrs Leach insisted that she was under a duty of confidentiality not to
report these matters. However, she had always been assured by West that,
when he came to trial, the full truth would come out.
West, the witness insisted, implicated himself, Rosemary, a person who
cannot be named for legal reasons, and others in their killings.
He also said that his first wife Rena, and the man who legally cannot
be named, were responsible for the death of Ms McFall.
The trial had been adjourned until yesterday to enable Mrs Leach to
continue her cross-examination by Mr Richard Ferguson QC, defending.
Wheeled into the witness box, pale-faced Mrs Leach gasped for breath
as she responded to cross-examination.
She told the court there were long spaces where she had conversations
with West between his interviews with the police.
Mrs Leach said that, from the outset, West was prepared to take the
blame for everything to save Mrs West and also for the sake of his
children.
Although they had been in care for some considerable time, he was
convinced Mrs West would once again gain custody of them.
''He said he would do anything for Rose and the children. He said he
loved his children.''
Mrs Leach said she continued visiting West because: ''I just wanted to
get to the bottom of where he buried the rest of the girls.''
She denied that she continued a relationship with West -- even though
she was no longer regarded by police as the ''appropriate adult'' -- to
keep open a source of information which might be useful in a book.
Mrs Leach said West had often said he would disclose where the bodies
were. She visited him almost on a weekly basis.
She agreed that West, upset by the fact his family were not contacting
him, telephoned her roughly three times a week -- in one week alone
phoning almost every night.
Throughout his alleged confessions, the witness agreed she could not
tell whether the information she was being given was true or false.
She said she was under stress when she was hearing details that West
was keeping from the police during his interviews.
It was only after West committed suicide she felt free to speak to the
police about what he had said to her in private.
However, her evidence indicated that she had made approaches via a
friend to the Mirror Group newspapers months before West died. At one
stage during her evidence, Mrs Leach, sobbing heavily was invited by the
judge to compose herself and sip water.
She denied that she was keeping contact with West to enable her to
obtain more vivid and lurid versions of events to make a possible book
more marketable.
She agreed that before she finally spoke to the police on April 24
this year, her solicitor had pointed out a worst-case scenario where Mrs
Leach might have to give evidence.
That was that Mrs West could be found not guilty. ''You would be
prepared to assist in the hope this would not happen?'' Mr Ferguson
asked.
''Yes,'' the witness replied. She denied she had connived with West to
make up the account she had given the court in her evidence.
Mr Ferguson also referred to letters which West sent her from prison
in which he had referred to her as ''kid''.
One read: ''Lovely to see you on Friday. You looked well. Keep it up,
kid. You looked great.
''When this you read remember me.
''Let the world say what they will. But speak of me as you find me.
''If the police will let you and I have two weeks together, we would
sort this out and have all the right persons in prison where they should
be.''
Mrs Leach said that, if West thought there was an emotional attachment
between him and her, it was one-sided on his behalf.
Under re-examination, Mrs Leach agreed with Mr Brian Leveson QC,
prosecuting, that that letter was written after she had suffered a
stroke.
Before the jury left court, trial judge Mr Justice Mantell said Mrs
Leach had been called by the Crown to rebut taped evidence from West,
played at the request of the defence.
Her evidence had possibly been called to discredit whatever West had
said in his statement.
None of it could be considered by them as evidence against Mrs West.
It was all to do with West's credibility in the evidence he had given
from beyond the grave in tape recordings played to them.
The trial continues.

A SHERIFF has called for an end to the practice of laying poisoned
bait following the trial of a farmer.
Sheriff James Smith said he accepted that Graham McClymont had acted
in accordance with general agricultural practice as he understood it to
be, but added that, if there was a general practice of this nature, it
was a highly dangerous one.
Sheriff Smith, who convicted McClymont on one of three charges, at
Stranraer Sheriff Court yesterday, said it was a practice which he could
never envisage being permitted under the Protection of Animals
(Scotland) Act of 1912.
McClymont, of Cuil Farm, Palnure, Newton Stewart, one of the top
Blackface sheep breeders in the country, was convicted of leaving a bird
carcase laced with strychnine on Cairnsmore Estate, Palnure, Newton
Stewart, in Dumfries-shire.
Sentence was deferred until November 27 for McClymont to make a
donation to charity.
He had denied three charges and, after the Crown announced they were
not seeking a conviction, was cleared of endangering the public by
placing a poisoned bird carcase on the estate. It also dropped a third
charge which allegedly involved a spring trap.
During the trial, McClymont, 54, admitted lacing the head and neck of
a chicken with strychnine and burying them where he had regularly seen
foxes.
He was charged after a five-year-old labrador died of strychnine
poisoning.
Although the sheriff agreed with a defence submission that foxes could
properly be catergorised as vermin, he added that McClymont had failed
to take any precautions to prevent access to the poison by other
creatures.

<HEADLINE>Scottish firm faces fears over super-salmon trials</HEADLINE>

A DOOMSDAY scenario in which genetically-engineered super-salmon,
growing five times faster than normal, escape into the wild -- then
usurp native stocks and other species -- is looming.
The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (Nasco) said
yesterday it must never be allowed to happen and called for absolute
guarantees that the fish are contained within tanks if experiments prove
commercially viable.
Otter Ferry Salmon, based at Loch Fyne in Argyll, is to decide soon
whether to take part in trials to discover if super-salmon can be
hatched and raised for market.
Under the proposal, Scottish salmon eggs would be injected with a gene
which affects growth hormones, a technology pioneered in America and
Canada. It is hoped that crops of farmed salmon, each weighing three
kilos, could be raised for sale within nine months instead of three
years.
The firm, renowned for research into halibut breeding techniques, has
been offered the chance to duplicate super-salmon trials in Canada. A
consortium in Chile, where there are no native salmon, has told Otter
Ferry that it is interested in farming the fish.
However, there are many issues to be resolved before then -- including
questions about the texture of salmon with such rapid growth rates.
Nasco, the inter-government treaty organisation, is more concerned at
what could happen if super-salmon escaped into the wild. It wants the
fish to be sterilised, a technology already widely used in the
production of farmed rainbow trout, although the process cannot be
guaranteed to work every time.
Mr Malcolm Windsor, Nasco secretary, said the salmon must be hatched
and contained under the most stringent precautions against escape; an
evaluation of potential impact must also be carried out prior to
commercial production.
Mr Windsor said salmon had been ''genetically tuned'' over thousands
of years to return to the rivers of their birth to breed. ''Suddenly,
there is the prospect that salmon with new genes -- not even salmon
genes -- could escape, and that would fly against nature's fine tuning.
''It is almost certain that some will escape. They could cause an
irreversible change to the wild salmon population.''
Mr Windsor fears that problems would not be resolved even if the
super-salmon were sterile. Having lost the urge to breed, they could
remain in rivers, ousting local fish populations, or ''cruise around
coastal areas like great battleships, eating young salmon as they leave
rivers for the sea''.
Environmental groups are also concerned that super-salmon could have
an adverse impact on ecology; it is well documented that the extinction
of many native species is a result of others being introduced by man.
Otter Ferry director David Patterson stressed that no decision on
trials had been taken but said the Health and Safety Executive had
already approved safety procedures involving its land-based tanks.
The firm must make a decision before Christmas, or else research would
be put back a year owing to the availability of salmon eggs.
It would take three to four generations -- 10 years -- before
commercial production would be viable when there were enough fish
carrying the gene available for cross-breeding.
Mr Patterson confirmed that natural stocks could be damaged if the
fish escaped and conceded that people might not buy super-salmon despite
the use of similar technology to produce other foods, notably fruit and
vegetables.
He said there was no question of allowing the fish to escape: ''That
would be unacceptable.'' If necessary, they could be hatched and raised
in towns or cities, miles from rivers or the sea.
Mr Patterson stressed that his firm would need financial backing from
industry if any trials to see if the super-salmon could be grown
commercial were to continue long-term.

EDINBURGH is leading the way in the UK by setting detailed standards
for the look and design of its streets, city planners claimed yesterday.
They were hailing the publication of a new manual suggesting ways in
which the streetscape -- the area between buildings -- can be improved.
The book's technical editor Colin Davis said: ''I am convinced that no
other city in the UK has gone so far to set clear standards for all the
constituent parts of its streetscapes.''
He claimed their pioneering approach to street design would be
followed by many cities across the country.
The practical guide is published by a number of local agencies
including Lothian Regional Council, Edinburgh District Council, and
Historic Scotland.
It is aimed at engineers, architects, conservationists, and everyone
concerned with the built environment.
Speaking at a conference, Communication by Design, Lothian Region
Transport director Dr George Hazel said people were usually concerned
with only one aspect of a street such as its traffic or a particular
building.
The new publication encouraged a partnership approach to improve the
overall vision.
''Edinburgh is a unique city steeped in history but with the need to
adapt to meet the changing demands and expectations of its residents and
businesses. This manual proves a valuable tool to ensure that these
adaptations are carried out sensitively,'' he said.
Training programmes and seminars will be held to encourage
participation and involvement in the new manual quality and design
programme.

A BODY-builder denied yesterday that he had been a major supplier of
steroids to hundreds of Scots athletes and body-builders.
Mr Alexander Bryden, 41, from Edinburgh admitted, however, that he had
been a Temazepam courier.
He told the High Court in Glasgow that he did three or four runs from
Penrith to Glasgow for a body-builder called Steven Coan.
Mr Coan, 24, and two other men, Mr James MacLean, 20, and Mr John
McDonald, 26, deny being concerned in supplying ecstasy in the Marriott
Hotel, Glasgow, in July.
Mr Brian Smith, 30, was cleared of the charge yesterday when the Crown
accepted his not guilty plea but he admitted possession of ecstasy
tablets in his Renfrew home, and will be sentenced at the end of the
trial.
The court has heard that Mr Coan was arrested after undercover
detectives, who were allowed to give evidence under assumed names and
behind a screen, helped arrest him in connection with the seizure of
5000 ecstasy tablets worth #100,000 on the streets.
Yesterday, Mr Bryden admitted to Mr Scott Brady, prosecuting, that he
had introduced Mr Coan to one of the undercover officers called Robbie,
who was posing as a buyer of ecstasy.
Mr Coan, he alleged, offered to get the ecstasy and also gave him a
price of #4.85 each.
Mr Bryden also admitted at that time he was on bail after having been
arrested with 38,000 Temazepam tablets for Mr Coan, who had promised him
#500 to bring them from Penrith to Glasgow.
Mr Bryden also revealed that he gave police a list of men from all
over the UK who were dealing with body-builders and athletes in anabolic
steroids.
However, he denied he was a major dealer retiring from the steroid
business and that he introduced Mr Coan to the undercover detective as
the man who was going to take over from him.
The trial continues.

A JURY chosen yesterday for an alleged #4m fraud and embezzlement case
against a solicitor was warned that it could be a long trial.
Temporary judge Robin McEwan QC, told the 10 women and five men that
he could not predict how long the case would last at the High Court in
Glasgow.
Lawyer Giles Davies, 40, of Corwar House, Barrhill, Ayrshire, denies
three charges.
His trial could last for more than five weeks and 245 witnesses from
across the UK and from Canada, Australia, and other parts of the world
have been cited to give evidence.
Almost 1000 productions, including files and other documents, have
been lodged.
Mr Davies is charged with embezzling #1.7m and almost $1m in a
nine-year period between December l983 and May 1992, while working as a
solicitor at Victoria Street, Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire, and at Bank
Street, Dumfries, and his home in Barrhill.
He is also accused of embezzling #1.4m between December 1991 and May
1992.
A third charge alleges that Mr Davies obtained #48,000 by fraud
involving a bank bridging loan for a property known as The Old Mill,
Symington, Ayrshire.
Retired Royal Bank of Scotland manager Ian Meldrum, 62, of The
Dinning, Auldgirth, Dumfriesshire, was called as the first witness by
Advocate-depute Alan Turnbull but the case was then adjourned until
today.

PRESIDENT Sir Bryan Nicholson led the charge against the Euro-sceptics
at the Confederation of British Industry conference in Birmingham
yesterday, warning that the business of Europe could not be ''left to
the politicians or the frenzied fringe''.
He told delegates: ''There are too many people around who substitute
messianic fervour for rational debate.'' He emphasised that the CBI
would continue to fight the corner of British business.
Sir Bryan, speaking at the opening of the European debate only a few
hours before a Euro-sceptic fringe meeting was taking place, pointed to
recent survey results and said that business clearly had made up its
mind that it took a positive attitude to the economic benefits of the
European Union and, in particular, the single market and wanted to see
ordered development of that approach.
However, he made it clear that being positive did not mean being
starry-eyed, as some had caricatured the attitude of business. There
were dissenting minorities on one or other issues but there were strong
majorities on most issues.
Sir Bryan's robust stance clearly had the support of the vast majority
of the business delegates.
Mr Christopher Haskins chairman of Northern Food, said the only reason
to opt out of monetary union would be if Britain wanted to devalue. He
said opting out would mean losing market share, higher inflation, and
unstable currency. He insisted: ''The business vote must be cast in
favour of EMU.''
Mr Niall Fitzgerald, vice-chairman of Unilever and chairman of the CBI
Europe Committee, said that too often he heard politicians in the UK
speak of Europe as if it were somewhere else, somewhere over there, a
threat rather than an opportunity.
''The UK is today a part of Europe and we are uniquely placed to make
it work to our advantage. And this we must do, instead of wallowing in
self-indulgent misty-eyed nostalgia for a colonial past, as some
Euro-sceptics are wont to do.''
He said political divisions over Europe and the statements which
result has often been misguided and damaging to British business and
economic interests.
Opposition to Britain's membership of a single European currency,
meanwhile, was set out by former Tory leadership contender John Redwood
at a fringe meeting, unprecedented at a CBI conference.
He claimed the Chancellor's freedom of action would be limited
severely if Britain was to join the single currency -- he would not be
able to change interest rates, increase or decrease borrowing or change
public spending as he saw fit.
Mr Redwood said: ''He could no longer do this if Britain joins a
single currency. There would be no pound and no interest rate for the
Chancellor to set.''
He said that, in 1990, opposing entry into the exchange- rate
mechanism was heretic-speak. However, interest rates had to be kept
high, businesses went bust, a million jobs were lost, and foreign
exchange reserves were used in defending the pound.
Mr Redwood said the ERM was a warning, adding that a single currency
would be a permanent ERM. ''None of the strain could be taken on the
exchange rate. All the strain would be taken on profits, turnover, and
jobs.''
Strongly defending Europe, Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the
European Commission, reassured businessmen that the tide of social
regulation had all but dried. He told them that the emphasis now was on
job creation. It was on labour market flexibility.
Sir Leon said Europe today was more open and sympathetic to Britain
and British interests than it had ever been. It was listening to
business and what business wanted.
He appealed to the Government not to cave in to pressure from the
Euro-sceptics by ruling out Britain's participation in a single currency
in the lifetime of the next Parliament.
Such a pledge, reportedly being recommended to the Prime Minister as a
vote winner in the General Election, had superficial attraction at
Westminster but was unwise, Sir Leon said.

THE Government yesterday launched a new drive to shake up the long
tail of under-performing companies which were ''blurring'' British
industry.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine described the under-achieving
firms as ''laggards'' and accused them of being complacent about their
performance.
He announced a scheme under which companies could compare their
performance with others as the ''crucial first step'' to improvements.
The so-called benchmarking scheme will be aimed at helping firms
attain world-class performance, Mr Heseltine told the CBI conference.
He complained that while Britain had some of the finest companies in
the world it also had four times as many firms which lagged behind the
best in other countries.
''This long tail of under-performers holds down the national average
and blurs the excellence of the leaders in their field.''
He called upon CBI leaders and successful companies to help deliver
the scheme and said he was writing to Britain's top 1000 companies to
seek their co-operation.

business priorities for Europe and exert real influence on UK decision
makers.
Mr Fitzgerald said the CBI would be organising a series of events

CBI Scotland chairman Andrew Cubie, who will be leading the CBI
Scotland group to Brussels, called for a strengthening of links with
Europe. He said: ''The aim of the campaign is to stimulate a much more
informed debate about Europe and to set out clearly the needs and
aspirations of the Scottish business community within the European

He said Europe and its institutions had to work in order to ensure
Scotland's future prosperity and that CBI Scotland had a leading part to
play in promoting a committed, constructive but critical attitude to

MACHO management styles are likely to result in demoralisation,
stress-related absenteeism, and higher staff turnover, according to Ms
Dianah Worman, equal opportunities adviser to the Institute of Personnel
and Development.
Workplace bullies are more likely to destroy their victims' confidence
than bloody their noses, she told a CBI fringe meeting in Birmingham
yesterday.
Bullying, in its most extreme form, might result in physical assault,
she said, but employers' harassment policies should take account of its
other, more subtle guises.
Bullies often employed a variety of devious tactics such as excluding
victims from social activities or constantly changing work targets or
deadlines, Ms Worman said.
Bullying is by no means confined to managers abusing their power, Ms
Worman added. Research suggested that victimisation by fellow colleagues
was common, often motivated by jealousy or resentment. ''Anyone who is
perceived as different, or who is in a minority, is vulnerable,'' she
said.
Ms Worman added: ''Employers should not assume that it is enough to
have a policy which addresses the problems of sex, racial, political,
and religious discrimination. To be truly effective, a harassment policy
needs to apply to everyone in the workforce and include all forms of
intimidatory behaviour.''
Speaking at the same meeting, Ms Olga Aikin, an employment lawyer and
senior partner in the Aikin Driver partnership, said the law as it stood
did not provide an effective remedy for people who had lost their job as
a result of bullying.
She said: ''Employment law concentrates on whether the actions of the
employee warrant dismissal and tends to ignore the conduct of the
employer. Unless there is sex, race or religious (Northern Ireland only)
discrimination, the bullied employee has to prove that the manager's
actions amount to constructive dismissal, which is never an easy task.''

PERSONNEL files which may have helped the Government's inquiry into
the employment practices of Monklands District Council have been
destroyed.
Mr William Nimmo Smith QC, appointed by the Scottish Office to conduct
the inquiry, began taking evidence in public yesterday and conceded he
had come up against the fact that files were held for only six months
before being destroyed.
Mr Nimmo Smith pointed out that there was no sinister implication in
their destruction. This was confirmed by Monklands District Council's
chief administrative officer Alan Clarke, who said there simply was not
the space in the building to keep them.
There can be 200 applications for every vacancy advertised by the
council, the second largest employer in the area, so filing cabinets can
fill up swiftly.
The lack of files shows how difficult Mr Nimmo Smith's task will be.
The inquiry was called following years of press speculation that people
were given jobs unfairly because they were relatives of councillors,
because of their religion, or because of their political connections. It
became popularly known as the ''jobs for the boys'' scandal.
Three senior officials at the council gave evidence yesterday and all
said they knew of no cases where people were unfairly selected for jobs.
Even the Supreme Knight of the lay Catholic organisation the Knights
of St Columba gave evidence to rebut claims that councillors on key
committees were members of the KSC and had not declared an interest.
An earlier inquiry by Professor Robert Black had said it had been
suggested repeatedly that Knights were members of important committees.
Yet the Supreme Knight, Yorkshireman Antony Britten, said he had
checked with the Knights' Charter Councils in Coatbridge and Airdrie and
not one councillor was a member.
He had even supplied Mr Nimmo Smith with a list of all local members
so that he could cross-check his evidence.
The only suggestion of any unusual practices which emerged from
yesterday's evidence was the chief administrative officer's recollection
of a now disused method of applying for manual jobs at the council,
whereby application forms from the Jobs Centre were pink, while those
from the council offices were green.
Councillors who were asked by friends or constituents about jobs gave
them green forms and this became an informal recommendation from the
councillor.
Mr Clarke stated though that he knew of no case where officials were
put under pressure to accept staff. In any case, by the time someone
reached the stage of an interview, his or her application form was
photocopied for the interview panel and therefore the colour of the
original document was not apparent.
At the inquiry in Coatbridge Town Hall, there is no cross-examination
only the gentle probing of Mr Nimmo Smith. That produced a slight
altercation with the district council's chief executive Maurice Hart who
took exception to being asked by Mr Nimmo Smith whether he was a weak
person who allowed councillors to get away with things.
Mr Hart expressed his amazement that Mr Nimmo Smith had said such a
thing about him in front of the press. ''It is just nonsense. I am not a
weak person,'' he said, and conceded: ''I am probably a modest person.''
Mr Nimmo Smith smoothed the tension by explaining: ''I'm not saying
you are these things, it's what people are saying to me.''
Mr Hart went on to explain the recruitment procedures of the council.
At one time, there was a staff rotation committee, which in effect meant
that up to six councillors conducted every job interview -- even for the
lowliest grade.
This was discontinued after the council's auditors drew attention to
the expense of such a system. After that, two councillors, the
chairperson of the appropriate committee and the chairperson of the
personnel committee, conducted interviews.
This, too, has been discontinued following a report by consultants
Ashdown and Milan who looked into the council's practices. Mr Richard
Ashdown told the inquiry that the personnel department had been
under-resourced with only one member of staff with a professional
qualification.
Since then, the council has strengthened the department with a human
resource manager.
The public part of the inquiry is expected to take three weeks. Both
Monklands Labour MPs, Mrs Helen Liddell and Mr Tom Clarke, are due to
give evidence on Friday.

The findings come on the day when a 3000 jobs boost is expected to be
announced for Strathclyde.
Taiwanese company Chungwha Picture Tubes is considering a plant at
Mossend, Strathclyde, to manufacture tubes for TVs and computers.
The Ravenscraig analysis, was condemned by Labour and the STUC.
Labour's employment spokesman John McFall called the report a
''politically-driven exercise''. The STUC called the findings
''distorted''.
The Scottish Office issued a two-page summary of the report, carried
out by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants, emphasising its finding that
the adverse impact on unemployment had been ''decidedly short-lived''.
It comes in a chapter of the report which looks at the impact of the
3090 direct redundancies at the steel plant between February 1991 and
June 1992 on the local labour market.
The report concludes that, in addition to the 3090 redundancies, a
further 1921 jobs were lost in supplier companies and a further 128 jobs
went because local spending power was reduced.
However, after the first two phases of the closure, local unemployment
rose seven base points above the national level and within months it was
back in line with the national trend. The final closure pushed the local
rate up again but, within five months, the local rate had returned to
the national trend.
The report concludes: ''The impact of the redundancies . . . has been
negative but decidedly short-lived.'' Another part of the report, the
results of a questionnaire of former British Steel employees, conducted
in 1994, suggests that the large number who entered training after
losing their jobs was a major reason why local unemployment did not stay
higher longer.
Of 555 people surveyed 64% went straight into training.
Only 13% of the sample found work immediately, while a further 23%
either registered as unemployed or became economically inactive. By the
time the survey was conducted, in August 1994, 56% of the sample were in
work, 25% registered unemployed, while a further 15% were economically
inactive. Of those who had opted for training, 32% ended up unemployed
or inactive.
Dr John Reid, MP for Motherwell North, said the impact of nearly half
the sample still without jobs was still being felt. ''Anyone who lives
here and talks to the corner stores, the chip shops, and the hotels
knows how difficult times have been for them.
''There is absolutely no room for complacency in this area.''
Board of Trade president Ian Lang yesterday opened a #20 million
expansion to Motorola's semiconductor plant at East Kilbride which will
create a further 250 jobs at the US-owned plant.
And Finnish company Nokia is considering Lanarkshire for cellular
phone factory which would employ 700.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975388955</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION personality Terry Wogan has sold his Scottish forestry
investments.
The Irish-born entertainer was one of several showbusiness stars who
bought woodland in Caithness and Sutherland for tax-relief purposes.
Wogan took a #115,000 stake in commercial tree-planting 10 years ago,
when he bought three remote moorland sites totalling 1430 acres at the
height of the Flow Country ''trees versus birds'' controversy. The tax
concessions for new forest schemes were axed in the 1988 Budget but they
continued for existing plantations up to two years ago.
Now Wogan has sold the land for which he paid about #80 per acre. The
current rate is #120 an acre but he would have expected to get #160 when
he first invested 10 years ago.
Others who bought land for forestry were snooker stars Steve Davis and
Alex Higgins.
Wogan's land was managed by Fountain Forestry and planted mainly with
Sitka spruce and Lodgepole pine. He had planned to sell to a
Lancashire-based businessman, a forestry insider said yesterday, but
Fountain invoked a pre-emption right and bought all three sites instead.
Mr Bruce Taylor, of chartered surveyors Bell Ingram's Ardgay,
Sutherland, office, said there was evidence that plantation owners were
seeing levels of financial return well below expectations.
''They have committed significant amounts of personal income to such
projects in the belief that the capital value of their property would be
well in excess of current market values.''
Forest sales at the 10year stage were common practice but prices were
lower in the Flow Country because of extra problems which included the
danger of wind damage, a 40-year wait for harvesting, and the
difficulties of hauling timber down forest tracks and narrow roads.
The Flow Country hit the headlines when conservationists claimed
forestry was destroying the largest single area of scarce blanket bog in
the world.
It is vital to sustain breeding populations of Dunlin, Greenshank,
Golden Plover, Arctic Skua, and other rare species of birds.
A Fountain Forestry spokesman in Inverness said yesterday: ''Because
of the level of publicity there has been in the past about the Flow
Country controversy, we are not commenting at this time.''
Terry Wogan was on holiday and not available for comment. His
London-based accountant also declined to say anything.

A SCOTTISH woollen mill was yesterday fined #12,000 after it admitting
displaying misleading price labels on garments during a sale at its shop
in York.
The shop, run by D and R Murray (Hawick) Ltd, was visited by trading
standard inspectors last March. Yesterday the company admitted six
charges of having misleading price labels on knitwear, sweaters, and a
woman's shirt.
Mr Ed Chicken, prosecuting, said red sale tickets were stuck below the
price on the swing labels of the garments indicating substantial
reductions.
A garment which the company claimed was selling for #39.99 had a sale
price of #24.99, leaving the customer to believe there was a #15
reduction. In fact, when checks were made, the original price was
#26.99, resulting in an actual reduction of just #2.
He said other prices had been inflated so the shop could claim
reductions, whereas the real and accurate reduction rate was at the most
#4 and nothing at all in some cases.
Mr John Lawrence, in mitigation, said the pricing and labelling of all
garments was done centrally at company headquarters in Hawick.
This was done up to six months before the garments were displayed in
their 26 branches in Scotland and England. He said the sales labels were
put on by the staff at each shop.
Trading had been difficult in this section of the retail industry in
recent years and, as a result, there had been reductions from time to
time after the garments arrived from the mill.
''There was no intention to mislead,'' he said ''The public was
getting the goods considerably less than what had been intended.''

PEACE may be on the cards for the troubled Highland Communities NHS
Trust despite more than 1000 staff members indicating they have no
confidence in the trust board.
Last week the trust's chief executive, Mr St John Hattersley, resigned
from his #57,000 a year job.
A ballot of the trust's doctors and dentists had made clear they no
longer had confidence in Mr Hattersley, following projections that the
trust faced a #1.8m deficit this year.
Nurses and other support staff were asked to participate in a vote of
no-confidence in the trust board, following publication in September of
plans to cut the deficit by #1.3m.
These included the shedding up to 45 jobs and the possible closure of
a ward at Inverness's main geriatric hospital.
The results of this ballot were announced yesterday, showing that
1024, or about 50% of the staff, no longer had confidence in the board.
Mr David Robertson, interim chairman of the joint staff consultative
committee, said last night the staff would not push for any more
resignations, if the board would publicly acknowledge they had made
mistakes.
Mrs Janet Syer, the trust's director of nursing and human resources
seemed happy to oblige. She said: ''We acknowledge that there have been
mistakes in the past, but there have been significant developments over
the last week. We feel that there is now an opportunity for a new
beginning.''
Mr Howard Waldner, the acting chief executive, agreed and indicated
that the trust's recovery plan would now be negotiated with staff.
Meanwhile the trust also announced that it is proposing a 3% pay
increase for its staff.

THE latest intervention by the legal authorities into the events on
the field of play again raises major issues which the Crown sooner or
later is going to have to face.
The principle having been established by the Ferguson case, the
question of consistent application of the law is once more uppermost.
The Scottish Football Association's attitudes also enter the equation,
principally its policy of turning its back on what is, in very many
cases, the best evidence available, that of television recordings -- a
short-sighted refusal for all the wrong reasons which really forces the
hand of the Crown and makes intervention more-or-less inevitable.
Unfortunately from the point of view of the Crown, once again the
spotlight falls on Ibrox, fuelling the already-well developed paranoia
of both that club and its supporters that they are being singled out and
victimised.
There could hardly have been a soul left in Scotland who by this
morning had not been exposed at some length to the latest inquest into
the behaviour of Paul Gascoigne.
The television examination could not have been more exhaustive and the
views by informed commentators so consistently condemnatory. Whatever
else the standard of behaviour was, and whoever was to blame, it clearly
was not high. Rangers supporters argue, not unnaturally, that justice
should be blind and that context is immaterial.
Yet, in that light, it is interesting to note that Strathclyde Police
said yesterday they had been asked by the procurator-fiscal in Glasgow,
not simply to investigate Gascoigne's behaviour, but ''incidents which
allegedly occurred'' during the game.
The reality is that the police report will focus on at least five such
clashes, involving several other Rangers players and several Aberdeen
players, as well as Gascoigne. If there are to be further proceedings,
Gascoigne may find himself with company in the dock.
Where would that leave Sean Sweeney of Airdrie, or for that matter
Alan Lawrence of Hearts, both apparently involved in recent incidents,
one in a Coca-Cola Cup semi-final at McDiarmid Park in Perth, and the
other in a premier division match at Ibrox? The first incident was
televised, the other missed by the cameras. There has been no action so
far about the first incident, but Lawrence may face SFA action.
A number of serious issues arise and now need to be dealt with,
believes Glasgow solicitor-advocate Mr Gerry Brown, a member of the Law
Society of Scotland's criminal law committee, who has represented a
number of sportsmen in the past.
''We are dealing with sport which can be seen simply by spectators who
are there, or on television or on video. What has to be determined is
whether these are all going to be dealt with similarly and, if they are,
should there not be a consistent policy laid down by the Crown Office,''
he says.
Mr Brown adds: ''Televised football is not a local matter, but can be
Scottish-wide or even UK-wide. As such, it should not be left up to the
vagaries of one particular procurator-fiscal's office. There should now
be a uniform policy applying to every Scottish game.''

<HEADLINE>As ecstasy girl lies in a coma, rave organiser warns over drugs abuse in Stornoway. 'Somebody is going to die there'</HEADLINE>

THE drugs problem in Stornoway is worse than it was at Hanger 13, the
rave venue in Ayr shut down after three young people died, it was
claimed last night.
The assertion was made by the man who organised last Friday's rave in
Lewis after which a 15-year-old boy, David Stewart, spent more than 24
hours in a coma.
The teenager, from Lower Bayble, Lewis, was released from hospital
last night. However, in Chelmsford, Essex, the condition of Leah Betts,
who has been in a coma since she took a contaminated ecstasy tablet at
her 18th birthday party on Saturday, remained unchanged.
Mr David Faulds, publisher of the Glasgow-based dance magazine, M8,
said: ''Drug abuse in Stornoway has increased six-fold since our first
rave there in August. I've never seen anything like it. Someone is going
to die there.
''The kids up there are so naive and ignorant. They mix alcohol with
drugs like ecstasy, despite all the warnings. There is a strong drink
culture and they just won't listen.''
Mr Faulds said that he personally organised the Stornoway event and
acted as head of security on the night. He rejected the claims of Mrs
Rena Gallagher, David Stewart's mother, that her son had taken a spiked
drink.
''I have made inquiries and found that Mrs Gallagher's son was at a
party before he went to our rave after 9pm,'' said Mr Faulds. ''His
friends tell me he took one tab of a drug called Apple and half a tab of
Superdove -- both of them are ecstasy derivatives.
''It is rubbish to claim he took a drink of water that was spiked.
Everyone at the rave had to go and fill their own.''
The publisher said that his staff soon pinpointed a local pusher in
Stornoway Town Hall at last Friday's rave.
''He had #30 on him when he was first searched. A few hours later he
had #200 in his pockets. We terrorised him and made him feel very
unwelcome,'' he said.
Mr Faulds said that a haul of seized drugs was handed over to island
police afterwards. He added: ''Last Friday in Stornoway was worse than
Hanger 13 was at its worst before it was shut down.''
Local organisers of raves in the islands did not have the experience
to run a rave properly as he and his staff could do, he said.
''I can tell you now that a locally-run rave in Stornoway two weeks
ago attracted drug dealers from around Scotland. It was a major drugs
event.''
Mrs Gallagher would not comment on Mr Faulds's claim.
Last night, Chief Inspector Peter Sinclair, the islands' police area
commander, fended off criticism that his officers were too slow to act
to combat the growing drugs problem in the islands.
He confirmed: ''This incident was not an isolated one. My officers
regularly have to take youngsters to hospital after abusing alcohol and
drugs.''
Mr Sinclair blamed parents for not checking on their children. ''They
should be checking where the kids have been and what condition they are
in when they come home.''
He said that police would be ''unstinting'' in their resolve to
prosecute the law-breakers who destroyed people's lives.
Meanwhile, Leah Betts, who fell into a coma after taking an ecstasy
tablet at her 18th birthday party, remained critically ill on a
ventilator last night. The condition of Leah, who is receiving
round-the-clock care at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, Essex, was said
to be unchanged.
Doctors said earlier that the student had shown no signs of
improvement since being taken to hospital at the weekend. She remained
unconscious and unable to breathe by herself.
Leah, of Latchingdon, Essex, collapsed during her birthday party at
home early on Sunday morning after taking the tablet.
Consultant anaesthetist Dr John Durcan said the longer her condition
remained the same the less likely were her chances of recovering.
''There is a significant chance she will not survive,'' he said.
''There is no real improvement since she came in.''
The next 48 hours would be crucial. Tests had been carried out and she
was being kept alive by a ventilator.
Leah's father, a former policeman, and stepmother, a nurse whose job
involves warning youngsters about drugs, were devastated as they waited
by her bedside.
Her heartbroken stepmother, Jan, broke down as she and husband, Paul,
pleaded with other teenagers not to take drugs.
Mrs Betts, who gave Leah resuscitation after she collapsed, said she
and her husband had stayed at home to make sure there was no drug-taking
or trouble at the party.
''It happened in the next room,'' she said. ''There was no indication
it was happening. No-one was drunk, no-one was high.''
Mr Betts said he was still trying to come to terms with what had
happened despite all his warnings to his children.
''I have got anger, hate, and I have got love for my daughter. I have
got anger for the people who bought the drugs and hate for the bastard
who supplied them.''
''I thought I knew what Leah was doing. It was her 18th birthday
party. It was to be a lovely day. My daughter paid #10 for this pill and
it is very likely to cost her life.''

THE number of deaths in fires dealt with by Strathclyde Fire Brigade
during the past year fell by 10 from the previous year to 42 -- the
lowest level recorded by the brigade.
Mr Neil Morrison, HM Chief Inspector of Fire Services, publishing his
intermediate inspection report on the Strathclyde brigade, said that
despite the downturn in the number of fatalities, work to educate the
public on the dangers of fire and the need to instal smoke alarms had to
continue to ensure the latest figures were ''not just a blip in an
increasing trend''.
He said it was encouraging to note that the number of malicious alarm
calls was 50% down on the previous year.
The brigade attended a total of 58,451 incidents for which an
emergency call had been received -- 9% below the figure in 1993.
The total number of fire incidents attended was 29,838, marginally
below the total for 1993.
The total number of malicious calls attended was 6926, a fall of
50.4%.
Of the 38 homes where there were fatal fires, 23 had been fitted with
smoke alarms but only six of the systems were considered to have
operated correctly at the time of the outbreak.
A total of 14 were not working properly due to the non-replacement of
faulty batteries.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State at the Scottish Office,
yesterday congratulated Strathclyde Fire Brigade for its efforts in
educating the public on the dangers of fire but re-emphasised the
importance of installing and maintaining smoke alarms.

MORE evidence of Italian universities illegally discriminating against
British employees was produced yesterday by Labour Euro-MP Hugh McMahon.
Mr McMahon has already petitioned the European Parliament over the
case of languages lecturer David Petrie, from Dumbarton, whose wages
were cut illegally by the University of Verona.
Mr Petrie and several other non-Italians have had their cases
supported by the European Court of Justice.
Now Mr McMahon is taking up the case of Ms Linda Armstrong and Ms
Marie Quinn, lecturers from England working in Italy.
He said: ''They are also being unfairly treated. Both of these women
have been forced to accept a reduction in their salaries of 20% when
they were obliged to stop work because of pregnancy. The same rules were
not applied to Italian lecturers.''

HOPES were still alive in Knoydart last night that Knoydart
Foundation's bid to buy the 17,000 acres that remain of the Knoydart
estate might yet be successful, despite speculation that its was not the
only bid.
Mr Andrew Rettie, of selling agent Strutt and Parker, said yesterday
that offers had closed at noon on Friday and the directors of Knoydart
Peninsula Ltd (KPL) were due to discuss the position.
The foundation, which includes the local community association, the
regional and district councillors, the John Muir Trust, the Chris
Brasher Trust, neighbouring estate owners the Delwart family, and owner
of the North Morar estate, West-End impressario Mr Cameron Macintosh, is
not thought to have offered the #1.5m asking price.
Local people had hoped the foundation's would be the only bid but
there were reports of at least three last night.
The estate, once 80,000 acres of wilderness, was broken up by Surrey
property dealer Philip Rhodes who, in 1993, sold the last 17,000 acres
to the jute company Titaghur for #1.8m. KPL became a wholly owned
Titaghur subsidiary.
Titaghur's chairman, Mr Reg Brealey, tried to establish a ''back to
basics'' adventure training school in Knoydart for disadvantaged
youngsters from Britain's inner cities. The project was refused planning
permission last year.
The financially troubled company was forced to put the estate on the
market earlier this year.

GLASGOW Airport passenger numbers, aircraft movements, and
cargo-tonnage levels have all fallen in the past year.
The decreases contrast with growth in most of these categories at six
other airports operated by British Airports Authority (BAA).
Last night, officials denied the Glasgow figures were anything more
significant than statistical or seasonal ''blips''.
Until now, it was assumed Glasgow would achieve a growth rate this
year, if only 1% -- with further growth forecast as the new #40m
international pier was utilised.
However, in the year to October, passenger levels fell by 0.9%;
aircraft movements by 2%, and cargo tonnage dropped by 36.9%.
Meanwhile, Edinburgh's passenger numbers leapt by 9.3%; aircraft
movements rose 5.2% -- and cargo levels soared by 69%. Aberdeen's
passenger totals were up 2.4% but aircraft movements fell by 3.9%,
although cargo tonnage rose 6.3%.
A BAA spokesman conceded that Glasgow is losing passengers to
Edinburgh because of traffic congestion, especially on the Kingston
Bridge.
In the financial year to date, its passenger numbers are down 2%, to
3,792,100. Edinburgh's are up by 10.1%, and Aberdeen's by 5.9%.
Other figures released by the BAA show that last month Glasgow's
performance paled in comparison with the same period last year.
Passenger numbers fell 2.9%, aircraft movements 1.8%, and cargo tonnage
by 29.4%.
In contrast, Edinburgh and Aberdeen's passenger totals rose
respectively by 10% and 6.2% in the month-to-month comparisons. In
addition, their aircraft movements leapt by 5.1% and 7.1%, with cargo
tonnage at Aberdeen up 1.5% but down 2.5% at Edinburgh.
A BAA spokesman stressed that Glasgow's fall in passenger numbers
could be explained partly on its greater dependence on charter business
than Edinburgh and Aberdeen, which had seen an increase in the number of
available services.
The spokesman stressed the figures were regarded as a blip, adding:
''These figures should be kept in perspective. It is very much a
seasonal and transitional industry . . . there is genuinely no cause for
concern.''
Overall, Scottish airports showed an increase in passenger traffic of
2.6%; a 0.5% fall in aircraft movements, and a 17.8% drop in cargo
tonnage -- compared with increases of 6.1%, 3.3%, and 7.5% for all BAA
airports.

BIRTHDAY celebrations to mark the first anniversary of the National
Lottery were showered with brickbats yesterday from the Church and
gambling watchdogs.
The Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev David Sheppard, gave the lottery a
birthday bashing, lamenting ''this huge new invasion in our life'' and
criticising the ''extreme hype of Saturday nights''.
Confirmation by Camelot that a second, midweek draw was under ''active
consideration'' did not please Dr Emanuel Moran, head of the National
Council on Gambling. ''The more sweets there are, the more rotten teeth
you have and the more buses, the more accidents you have,'' he said.
Camelot chief executive Tim Holley described the past 12 months as ''a
remarkable year for the lottery -- and the country as a whole''.
The lottery was now Britain's biggest impulse consumer brand.
Thousands of jobs had been created through retailers, Camelot suppliers,
and now in the construction industry, making use of funds.
Dr Sheppard supported calls for the jackpot to be capped and for curbs
on the wide availability of lottery tickets at newsagents and
superstores.
''People on benefit clearly cannot afford it and yet they are shelling
out large sums of money,'' he said.
Dr Moran, who is also a consultant psychiatrist treating compulsive
gamblers, said the National Lottery was raising enough money already
without having to introduce a second weekly draw.
''If they have a second draw is this going to be televised as well
before the 9 o'clock watershed? I am concerned about the impact on the
next generation of children in particular. This is adult
entertainment.''
Mrs Bottomley hailed the lottery as a ''stunning national
institution'' and the most efficiently run in Europe.
* The huge success of scratchcards has had an unexpected downside
costing millions of pounds in repair bills to vending machines, it
emerged yesterday.
The grey coating used on the scratchcards sticks to coins. Then when
the money is used in machines, the coating comes off and jams the
mechanism.

Millions lost through mismanagement.
ussels
MORE than #400m was skimmed from European Union funding in fraudulent
transactions last year, according to the community's official audit to
be published today.
Details of the spending review, passed to The Herald last night,
suggest the total amount of European taxpayers' money which was
inadequately accounted for could be as much as #2000m in 1994.
With fraud now a hot political issue on the EU's agenda -- put there
largely by the efforts of John Major -- the annual report of the
community's official court of auditors will be examined closely when it
is presented formally today to the European Parliament.
The report will show that #410m was lost through blatant fraud, waste,
and mismanagement. But the more alarming losses from the EU's #50bn
budget for 1994 could total about #2000m, although the auditors concede
that much of this money could have been spent quite properly, but not
accounted for satisfactorily.
The auditors say they believe this highlights the need for more
rigorous and systematic accounting controls. Suggestions for tougher new
monitoring procedures are expected to figure largely on the agenda for
next year's Maastricht Treaty review conference, when the whole question
EU fraud will be pursued by Mr Major.
The Prime Minister has seized on the issue as a means of placating
anti-EU forces inside the divided Conservative Party, who are arch
critics of waste in the community.
Compared with last year's auditors' report the losses appear to have
been reduced substantially. This time last year, the auditors were
talking of perhaps #10bn being inadequately accounted for, much of it
going to fraudsters. But the EU is always quick to point out that for
every #10 spent in the community, #8 is under the direct control of the
member states who are responsible for most losses, although ''Brussels''
is usually blamed.
Much of the missing money comes from the budget for the common
agricultural policy (CAP) which accounts for about half of all EU
spending. Swindles are most common in farm subsidies, notably for olive
oil and tobacco. Another favourite is cross-border movements of cattle
in floats which contain no cattle but which involve premium payments.
It is understood some member states, including Ireland, are taken to
task for deliberately underestimating their own wealth for the purposes
of calculating their annual contributions to the EU.
An EU official refused to go into detail about the report, but
admitted: ''There is further evidence of inadequate financial
administration by both the European Commission and member states
covering a significant part of the community budget in a wide variety of
areas.''
The report highlights the poor record of the commission in recovering
money known to have been dishonestly claimed under the EU's many funding
schemes. ''The EU auditors are seeking a fundamental change in the
financial management culture,'' the official said.
The audit concludes that a ''serious, concerted effort'' by the
commission and the EU's 15 member states is required, if the quality of
management of funding is to be raised.
Mr Andre Middelhoek, president of the EU's Court of Auditors, will
present the report to the European Parliament's plenary in Strasbourg
today.

FREDERICK West admitted killing and burying 20 further victims, whose
remains have not been recovered, Winchester Crown Court heard yesterday.
In addition, he claimed while in prison that his first wife Rena, from
Coatbridge, another of his victims, had been involved in the killing of
their Scottish babysitter Anne McFall, whom the court has heard was
pregnant by West when she disappeared.
The claims were made by West in private conversations with
mother-of-five Janet Leach, who was an independent observer in police
interviews with the Gloucester builder.
In a dramatic final day of evidence, pale-faced Mrs Leach returned to
the witness box at Winchester Crown Court after six nights in a local
hospital.
After being pushed into court in a wheelchair by a consultant
physician, key witness Mrs Leach told the jury the 20 victims were
additional to the 12 the jury trying Mrs Rosemary West had already heard
about.
One of the missing girls was likely to be Mary Bastholm, a 15-year-old
who disappeared in 1968 and who was linked with the search for Miss Lucy
Partington.
Mrs West denies 10 murders, including that of Miss Partington.
In evidence yesterday, Mrs Leach said she continued to see West in
prison -- even after being told she was no longer required as an
''appropriate adult'' -- in a bid to discover the burial site of the
remaining missing girls.
Speaking in a soft voice, sometimes breaking into tears, the charity
worker witness who became West's confidante said he told her about Miss
Bastholm, who went missing in January 1968.
She learned that Miss Bastholm was dead and buried at an undisclosed
farm.
Mrs Leach was the final witness in the trial. She had been called by
the prosecution in an attempted rebuttal of the police's taped
interviews with West which had been led as evidence in Mrs West's
defence.
The closing speeches by counsel will begin today and the jury is
expected to retire to consider its verdict early next week.

TONY Blair set up his stall in one of the hardest market places for a
Labour leader yesterday, the CBI annual conference, and emerged with a
general welcome from industrial leaders for his message.
In his key speech to the conference, Mr Blair promised that Labour had
changed and that the change was irreversible. He told his audience that
penal rates of taxation do not make economic or political sense. They
were, he said, gone for good.
Mr Blair's speech received a 55-second ovation, which the Deputy Prime
Minister Michael Heseltine, a perennial conference favourite, failed to
match. He notched up just 40 seconds.
Mr Blair told the conference: ''I want a tax regime where, through
their hard work, risk, and success, people can become wealthy.''
The Labour leader also strove to reassure delegates about Labour's
espousal of the Social Chapter and a minimum wage, to which most members
of the CBI are opposed. He also emphasised the importance of education.
Mr Adair Turner, the director general of the CBI, said: ''The overall
programme he outlines attracted a lot of interest and applause and we
can agree with many of the broad points of principle.
''His commitment not to return to penal taxes and his commitment to
stable economic policies and low inflation were all welcome.''
However, he added that while there may have been broad support for a
lot of what Mr Blair said, business would still looking for
clarification.
''We need to get more details on tax policy before the next General
Election and we still have concerns over issues such as the minimum wage
and the Social Chapter.
''But we do recognise the significant shift in attitude towards
business and welcome that.''
Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, said Mr Blair had
made a good job at presenting his case and helped allay concerns of some
but not all.
The new tone from the Labour Party was also welcomed by engineering
leaders. Mr Graham Mackenzie, director general of the Engineering
Employers' Federation, welcomed the stated commitment to stable economic
environment.
He particularly welcomed the emphasis Mr Blair put on education and
training and Europe to UK industry. However, he added: ''We remain
concerned about a number of policies that need clarification.''
Mr Heseltine, arriving to speak to the conference, said: ''I think Mr
Blair's speeches are interesting more for what he doesn't say than what
he does say.

Fiscal orders inquiry into Ibrox incidents
POLICE are to investigate alleged incidents during Saturday's match
between Rangers and Aberdeen at Ibrox, during which Paul Gascoigne was
involved in a number of violent clashes with opposition players.
A spokesman for the procurator-fiscal's office in Glasgow confirmed
that it had been decided a full investigation should take place.
The fiscal instigated a police investigation in April last year after
Duncan Ferguson, then at Rangers, head-butted Raith Rovers player John
McStay during a match at Ibrox.
Saturday's game contained a number of ugly incidents. Gascoigne was
involved in a tussle with Paul Bernard, which left the Aberdeen player
needing five stitches to a face wound. The Rangers player also lunged at
John Inglis with his head, striking the Aberdeen player in the midriff.
Midfielder John Brown appeared to lift a hand to Billy Dodds after the
Aberdeen striker kicked Alan McLaren and there were several other
wayward challenges from Gascoigne and other players.
During a break from training with the England team yesterday,
Gascoigne said: ''I went out on Saturday nervous because I didn't want
to get beaten. I am trying so hard, I am blaming myself for everything.
''Everybody wants us to get beat, and every time we do they slaughter
the team. The lads are feeling it.
''If they're going to look at the video of the game, then the Scottish
FA should also look at the video evidence of some of the decisions given
against us. I don't think people realise how much pressure we are under.
I'm not saying I'm victimised, but sometimes I feel I need a bit more
protection.''
Asked if he was worried about going to court, he said: ''That's not a
matter for me.''
The current investigation bears similarities with the events that led
to the jailing of Scotland player Ferguson. His assault was broadcast on
television, but no complaint was made against the player, now with
Everton, at the time. Like Gascoigne, Ferguson was not booked on the
day. The fiscal called for an investigation in the week following the
incident.
Four weeks before, Ferguson lost his appeal against a three-month
sentence and became the first player to be jailed following an on-field
incident.
Police and Crown Office officials yesterday refused to draw any links
between the two cases.
Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay, QC, could not talk about the
Gascoigne case, but said the club would co-operate fully with any
investigation.
When asked about his concerns about the behaviour of footballers, he
said: ''In a general sense yes, we are concerned, but why is it that
some incidents are thought to be worthy of investigation in one area but
not in another?
''It always is, and always will be, down to individual
procurators-fiscal. If, for the sake of argument, you stage an incident,
say in Glasgow, the procurator-fiscal might decide to take some sort of
action but then the procurator-fiscal in Dundee, for instance, might
not. And that cannot be right.''
Three weeks ago, Mr Findlay, in response to a question at the club's
annual meeting, called for the Crown Office to consider making public
its guidelines on offences involving footballers, so that the public
could be reassured that the law was being applied evenly throughout the
country.
He said he could understand why people felt there was one set of rules
for Rangers players and another for the public. ''It's easy to get
paranoid about the thing,'' he told the shareholders, adding: ''We are
Rangers. No-one likes us. And we don't care.''
Police based in Govan will carry out the investigation, which is
expected to last a number of weeks. The fiscal will examine the evidence
and decide whether or not to bring charges.
The Scottish Football Association declined to comment. It was awaiting
a report from the match supervisor. Mr Drew Herbertson, head of the
disciplinary department, said it would be speculation to anticipate the
contents of the report, which will scrutinise the performance of match
referee John Rowbotham.
If players are criticised in supervisors' reports they can face an SFA
disciplinary hearing, which can impose a ban or suspension.
Mr Herbertson said video evidence would not be used in any
disciplinary action. The SFA argue that video evidence would be unfair
on the big clubs, who regularly appear on television.
But Labour's Scottish home affairs spokesman John McFall said ''the
ostriches at the SFA should get their heads out of the sand and use
modern technology''.
He added: ''It would be in the best interests of the SFA, and football
in general, if they used the best evidence available. While they
continue that policy, they are doing Scottish football a disservice
because they are leaving it up to the Crown Office to get involved.''
He said decisive action by the football authorities could prevent the
intervention of the Crown Office.
Mr Tony Higgins, secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association, said it was a worrying trend that the Crown Office was
becoming increasingly involved in football matters. He stressed that the
football authorities were determined to take tough action against anyone
who broke the rules. He cited Duncan Ferguson's 12-match ban as an
example.
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said yesterday: ''It's not easy for me to
say anything. I will just have to leave it to the proper authorities.''
When he rejected Ferguson's appeal, Scotland's most senior judge, Lord
Hope said: ''It has to be made clear both to players and to the public
that such criminal acts cannot be tolerated on the field of play, any
more than they can be tolerated in any place in this country.''

Clinton vows justice for blast victims
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night expressed ''outrage'' over the
suspected car bomb blast in Saudi Arabia which killed six people and
vowed to help the Saudis bring those responsible to justice.
The US State Department said it was sending an FBI team to help the
investigation into the explosion which ripped into a Saudi national
guard training facility in the capital, Riyadh.
Four of the six dead were Americans, as were more than half of the 60
injured. The US embassy in Riyadh said one member of the military and
three civilians had been killed.
A fifth victim was believed to be a Filipino and the other is
unidentified. An earlier conflicting report from Washington, quoting
senior Defence Department officials, had stated that two US Army
soldiers and three American civilians were among the victims.
US embassy information officer in Riyadh, Mr Jeff Thomas, said three
of the American injured were in critical condition.
''Some others are still in surgery,'' he said, adding that no children
were mentioned as being among those injured. ''I believe there is
housing (for American military personnel) in the vicinity.''
Witnesses earlier said they saw bleeding women being taken to nearby
hospitals.
The building was being used by US civilian and military personnel to
train Saudis in the use of arms bought from Washington.
There was no immediate definite proof in the burned-out debris that a
car bomb was used but the blast was said to have come from a car park
next to the site.
There were also some reports of a double blast. The Pentagon said
there was a large explosion followed by a smaller explosion in the early
hours (around 8.20am British time).
A little-known group, the Islamic Change Movement, and a previously
unknown group, the Tigers of the Gulf, both claimed responsibility for
the bombing.
However, the claims were viewed with scepticism and it was not clear
whether the attack was aimed at the Saudis, the Americans, or both.
The Islamic Change Movement issued a statement in April saying Western
forces should leave Saudi Arabia or the movement would ''exert all
available means to evict these forces from the island of Islam''.
Saudi society is insular and tightly controlled by the Government, and
dissent is rare.
The last attack against American military in Saudi happened during the
1991 Gulf War, when an Iraqi Scud missile hit a US barracks, killing
more than 20 Americans.
President Clinton, in a brief statement released by the White House,
said: ''This morning's attack in Riyadh against an American facility is
an outrage.
''Our condolences and prayers go out to the victims and their
families. We appreciate the speed and professionalism with which Saudi
authorities have responded to this emergency and will work closely with
them in identifying those responsible for this cowardly act and bringing
them to justice,'' he said.
Mr Clinton told reporters earlier that the US had already begun the
process of determining what happened and who was responsible.
A dozen FBI agents and evidence specialists were packing to fly to
Saudi Arabia to help with the investigation. The team will be headed by
a supervisor of a counter-terrorism squad based in the Washington field
office.
US Ambassador Raymond Mabus said the blast, which devastated the
three-storey building, was caused by an ''explosive device'' though it
was not clear whether it was packed inside a car.
''We are outraged by this act . . . This was the work of cowards and
will not deter any mission in the Kingdom,'' Ambassador Mabus said.
The explosion set off a fire that engulfed the building, sending out
huge plumes of smoke seen across the city. At least one burned-out car
and several badly damaged cars were parked around the building's tangled
wreckage.
Officials said the building is leased by the US for training the Saudi
national guard.
The Americans who work in the building live in homes behind it and
some of these were also damaged by the blast, which was felt two miles
away.
About 200 people were in the building at the time, about half
Americans and half Saudis or third-country nationals, the official said.
Apart from the Gulf War incident, it is the most deadly attack on
Americans since the Beirut barracks suicide bombings in 1983 during the
Lebanese civil war in which 241 US Marines and 58 French paratroopers
were killed.
It is the first such incident in Saudi Arabia since 1991, when two
Americans were injured in an attack on their military shuttle bus.
In London, Saudi Arabian ambassador Dr Ghazi Algosaibi said the
explosion was an ''isolated incident'' and did not reflect on his
country's stability.
''This horrible incident reflects in no way on the stability of Saudi
Arabia. Each and every country in the world, including super-powers and
great powers, witness such acts,'' he said in a statement.
Diplomats in the Saudi capital said the British embassy issued an
internal message to its military personnel in the country informing them
of the attack.
''In the past, there have been generalised threats against Western
interests in Saudi Arabia, including against (Gulf war) coalition
personnel,'' diplomats quoted the message as saying.
It told ''high profile'' British organisations in the kingdom to
exercise ''vigilance''.
Mr Saad al-Fagih, a leader of a Saudi opposition group, the Committee
for the Defence of Legitimate Rights, said from his home in exile in
London that ''there is an environment for this sort of action''.
''There are very well-trained young men . . . who have weapons and
they are not being controlled by government security,'' al-Fagih said,
without giving details. His group advocates peaceful change in Saudi
Arabia and he said he had no information on the explosion.
Several little-known opposition groups have issued warnings against
Western interests.
Mr Bruce Hoffman, director for the centre of terrorism and political
violence at St Andrews University, said yesterday a group calling itself
the Islamic Change Movement sent a fax on July 3 to an Arab newspaper in
London, setting July 28 as a deadline by which all foreigners, foreign
military forces, and senior Saudi princes had to leave the country.
The fax also carried the emblem of the Arabian Peninsula Islamic
Change Movement --the Jihad (holy war) Wing which had issued a similar
statement in April.
''Fight those who believe not in God,'' the message said.
News organisations and the US embassy in Riyadh also received warnings
from the group which had earlier set June 28 as its deadline for what it
called ''Crusader forces'' -- American and British troops -- to get out
of Saudi Arabia.
''The movement will exert all means available to it to get these
forces out of the peninsula of Islam,'' it said, adding that, following
that warning: ''These forces have become a legitimate target.''
The Tigers of the Gulf claimed responsibility for the bomb blast in a
telephone call from Saudi Arabia to an international news agency. It was
not possible to verify the claim.
''I have never heard of these people and no-one I have talked to knows
who they are,'' one diplomat said.
''It seems a very small group must have gotten their hands on
explosives and carried out the attack but it is still to be seen if it
is the start of an anti-Western campaign in Saudi although I think it is
not part of a larger organised group,'' he said.

THE fourth Lord Rowallan, Mr John Corbett, is the subject of a report
to the procurator-fiscal after he allegedly assaulted his estranged wife
at an equestrian event in Ayrshire at the weekend.
The incident, involving Mr Corbett, 47, and his estranged wife Sandra,
35, took place at Muirmill Equestrian Centre near Symington on Sunday.
Mr Corbett moved six years ago from the family seat at Rowallan Castle
between Fenwick and Kilmaurs to Meikle Mosside Farm, near Kilmaurs.

ON the first anniversary of the National Lottery, a Herald survey has
found that almost half of 12 and 13-year-olds questioned at a Glasgow
school say they have bought a lottery ticket or an Instants scratchcard.
A total of 46.8% of the children said they had purchased one or the
other, often more than once.
The findings have raised fresh concerns that the lottery may be
creating a new generation of gamblers. Earlier this month, a study in
Essex found that 61% of 11 to 15-year-olds had bought a lottery ticket
and last week it emerged that a 15-year-old had won #10,000 on a
scratchcard.
The Herald's informal survey was compiled after questionnaires were
handed out to 50 children at the comprehensive school. Forty-seven
responded and a total of 85% said they knew the legal age for taking
part in both types of lottery game was 16.
A total of 34% said they had bought a lottery ticket and 25.5% said
they had bought a scratchcard. A total of 72% of those who had bought
either said they had done so more than once.
Of those who had actually bought tickets and scratchcards, 36% said
they had been turned away by a retailer at some point because they were
too young. Only one of those who had never bought either had been turned
away.
While critics of the lottery say they are disturbed at the findings of
the recent surveys, the Government remains adamant that the age limit
should not be raised to 18.
''This confirms that Camelot are not controlling the retail outlets
and it is very disturbing that our young people are being introduced to
this greed culture at such an early age,'' said the Reverend Bill
Wallace of the Church of Scotland's Board of Social Responsiblity.
Camelot's director of operations, Mr Norman Hawkins, however, admitted
that there was little they could do beyond stressing to retailers that
they must follow the law.
''Other than observation, we do have a security organisation within
Camelot which does follow up information. But there isn't a wider system
in place. How can there be with 26,000 retailers selling tickets to
millions of consumers?''
Labour's Scottish arts and heritage spokeswoman Helen Liddell said the
lottery had been a commercial success but the more undesirable facets
could not be ignored: ''It facilitates gambling amongst schoolchildren
and for these reasons it's important to begin now to comprehensively
analyse the wide-ranging effects of the lottery.''
The chief executive of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Andy Myles,
said: ''Everything possible must be done to ensure that children are
protected from gambling in exactly the same way they are protected from
tobacco and alcohol.''
Some experts say the lottery is thought to be changing the way
children view gambling. ''We are fairly sure it does affect children
quite markedly and there must be studies done on that as they grow up,''
said Mr Iain Brown, an expert on gambling addiction at Strathclyde
University.
''We think that their interest and expectation of gambling will have
been changed by the lottery and we may actually have another generation
who are much more aware of gambling opportunities than we have ever had
before..''.
