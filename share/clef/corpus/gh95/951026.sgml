THIS week's opening of a major retail park on the outskirts of
Edinburgh poses a challenge to Princes Street. While planners in the
West of Scotland generally insist that retail parks restrict their sales
to bulky goods such as furniture, carpets, and DIY materials,
Edinburgh's planners have granted ''open'' consents.
As a result, the 195,000 sq ft Hermiston Gait retail park at the
junction of the M8 extension and the Edinburgh city by-pass has
attracted many of the retailers who might normally be found only on
Scottish High Streets. The park is anchored by Homebase, the first of
Sainsbury's DIY stores in Scotland. The other tenants are: Curry's,
Halfords, Olympus, Harvey's Furnishings, Carpetrite, Children's World,
Byte Computers, Allied Carpets, and Shoe City.
Market rumour has it that the agents are close to signing a deal at
#22 per sq ft on a 15,000 sq ft unit which Cantors had pre-let but later
decided to hand back to the agents. Such a rental would be a new record
for Scotland where such rentals are usually around #10 per sq ft.
Hermiston Gait was developed by New Edinburgh Limited, a joint venture
between The Miller Group and Edinburgh Development &amp; Investment Ltd. The
park's estimated value is #42m, representing a yield of 5.75% which is
believed to be a record for a retail warehouse investment.
Joint letting agents are Grimley and Mason Owen. ''The success speaks
for itself,'' says Andy Carswell of Grimley. ''The West of the capital
is clearly one of the most dynamic commercial areas of the country and
that success is set to continue with the next phase of development.''
It is a similar story at Craigleith, another retail park under
development on the west side of Edinburgh, where rentals of #20 per sq
ft have been rumoured. This despite the fact that letting agents Peter
Campbell &amp; Co have not yet officially started marketing the scheme.
''Hermiston Gait and Craigleith are considered prime, so rents are
high,'' says Mike Simpson of Peter Campbell &amp; Co. ''But not every site
will come in at those sort of rates, it's certain that #20 won't be the
norm in Edinburgh and it would be potentially dangerous for people to
assume that #20 sets the tone for the East of Scotland. Many traditional
warehouse retailers would need much higher profits than they are
currently getting before they could consider #20 as normal.''
Apart from the high rentals which they are commanding, these new
schemes are remarkable for the high street retailers which they have
attracted. Many large retailers in the sports, toys and fashion sectors
are keen to hedge their bets by taking space on traditional city centre
pitches, like Edinburgh's Princes Street or Glasgow's Argyle Street,
while at the same time renting retail warehouses on the new out-of-town
retail parks like Hermiston Gait. One leading Edinburgh retail agent
says that Princes Street is already losing sales to The Gyle shopping
centre which was opened a couple of years ago and that the squeeze will
tighten.
''Hermiston Gait has attracted High Street retailers and Craigleith
will do the same,'' says Derek Gordon of agents Eric Young &amp; Co. ''These
schemes have been talked about for years, but they are now coming to
reality, and I'll eat my hat if Princes Street retailers don't feel the
impact.''

THE problems which have beset Rangers recently -- and which have sent
them crashing to two successive midweek defeats in vital fixtures -- may
ease over the next 48 hours, but they are far from going away.
Yesterday, following the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final defeat from Aberdeen
at Hampden, the Ibrox men were licking their wounds and coming to terms
with the fact that the 'treble' target they had set themselves had
disappeared for another season.
Manager Walter Smith refuses to hide behind his injury list. He
believes that to list the number of players missing would seem to be
giving excuses rather than reasons for the defeats by Juventus in the
Champions' League and Aberdeen in the first major cup competition of the
domestic season.
Yet, you cannot look at Rangers current plight without noting the
effects the injuries have had.
Yesterday Smith was able to hold out hope that skipper Richard Gough,
such an important element in any Ibrox line-up, would probably be okay
to play at Kirkcaldy this weekend and also against Juventus at Ibrox
next week.
Stuart McCall may also be ready for the visit of the Italian
champions, while Charlie Miller has now restarted training following his
shin splints problem.
The good news is tempered with the fact that they still have Brian
Laudrup, David Robertson, Ian Ferguson and Trevor Steven all out for
lengthy periods.
Indeed, against Aberdeen, because of the absence of Gough and
Robertson, Smith was forced to field a makeshift defence, and a
similarly thrown together midfield with only Paul Gascoigne as a
probable first pick there.
Smithe knows that excuses -- or even reasons -- for defeat are rarely
accepted by the demanding Rangers support, whose displeasure will
doubtless be voiced at the club's annual meeting in Glasgow this
morning.

SALIM Malik was yesterday cleared of bribery charges by a former
Pakistan Supreme Court judge investigating charges into Test cricket
corruption.
Malik was alleged to have attempted to bribe Australian trio Shane
Warne, Tim May and Mark Waugh during Australia's tour of Pakistan last
year, but Fakhruddin Ebrahim, who was asked by the Pakistan Cricket
Board (PCB) to investigate the charges last month, is convinced of
Malik's innocence.
''I believe 100% that Malik is innocent,'' revealed Ebrahim, who
claimed in his report that the allegations ''could not be believed and
appear to have been concocted for reasons best known to the accusers.''
Ebrahim, who also criticised the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) for
failing to send the three players to Pakistan for cross-examination,
also said he understood why the ACB had rejected his nine-page report
exonerating Malik.
''I wouldn't expect them to say anything else. They have to support
their players,'' he explained. ''All I want is for people to read my
report and come to their own conclusions.''
ACB chief executive Graham Halbish, who has invited Ebrahim to
interview the trio in Australia, has backed the players. ''The board
stands by its players and believes these statements are correct,''
insisted Halbish.
Waugh, quoted in an Australian newspaper, stressed: ''Why would I lie?
Why would any one one of us lie?. We're definitely not lying. I have
nothing to gain by it. There is no reason to make it up.''
Malik was due to join the Pakistan squad in Australia later this week,
when they open their seven-match tour, which will include three Tests,
with a limited overs encounter against a Chairman's XI at Lilac Hill.

Dundee.....2 Airdrie.....1
DUNDEE moved out of the shadows last night to claim a place in the
Coca-Cola Cup final against Aberdeen at the end of next month.
The Dens Park side have suffered over the past two decades as their
same street neighbours United have claimed all the glory on Tayside. But
now, with United toiling alongside them in the first division, Dundee
have taken centre stage with this victory over Airdrie at McDiarmid Park
last night.
It was the culmination for the Tayside team of a campaign which has
seen them knock out two premier division sides, Kilmarnock and Hearts,
and then last night defeat those cup specialists, Airdrie, with a late
goal.
It seemed that the match would move into extra time until Neil McCann,
Dundee's Under-21 international winger, took a hand in things.
Airdrie had equalised seven minutes from the end through substitute
Peter Duffield and that goal had the teams locked together with the 8930
crowd resigned to an extra half-hour, and perhaps penalty kicks.
But McCann had different ideas. With only two minutes remaining he
snatched a stunning goal which killed the Airdrie challenge and gave his
cash-strapped club a glimpse of glory, and a chance to have a huge cash
pay-off to ease their financial problems.
McCann moved on to the ball down the left wing with the Airdrie
defence in tatters around him. He went into the box, looked up, and then
carefully flighted the ball beyond John Martin and watched as it
swirled, struck the inside of the far post and then dropped into the
net.
The goal will live in his memory. He said: ''No-one could have written
the script for that goal. I did mean it. I looked up, saw the chance and
went for it. There are times you try that kind of thing and it doesn't
come off but this time it did.''
''We have beaten premier division teams already in the tournament and
we know what Raith Rovers did last year so we won't be frightened by
Aberdeen next month.''
If McCann was the match-winner, the hero was player-manager Jim Duffy,
who pulled on his boots again, and went out into a football action from
which doctors once banned him. He won the man-of-the-match award and
deservedly so as he stood firm at the heart of the Dundee defence,
guiding the players around him through difficult times midway through
the first half, and again at the beginning of the second half.
These were the spells when Airdrie looked to have the edge. But always
Duffy was there shouting instructions, timing tackles to perfection, and
making clearances when it seemed that he would not be able to reach the
ball.
It was a tour de force by the player-manager and he said: ''It's
nights like this that make you realise that being a manager is not such
a bad job after all. I just want to take this team to Hampden. I've
never done that before. I want to go now and to enjoy the final. I think
we have proved again that there are talented teams in the first
division.
''We realise, however, that our main objective remains promotion.
There is no point in getting to this final and then blowing our chances
of coming out of the first division. The players must continue with the
form they have been showing, and start to climb that table once more.
The very gratifying thing tonight was that the goals arrived from two of
our young players, Paul Tosh and Neil McCann.''
Dundee's first goal arrived five minutes before half-time and it came
at a stage when the Tayside team had been under pressure. They had
started well, and then the nervousness that Duffy had feared seemed to
affect his players.
Airdrie had a spell when they were controlling the play until in that
fortieth minute Paul Tosh took the scoring opportunity which was given
to him by full back Tommy McQueen. The defender had burst down the left
wing, reached the bye-line and sent a cross into the penalty box.
The ball was caught in the wind, blown out, away from goal and there
was Tosh, coming into the penalty box unmarked and with time to steady
himself before volleying a glorious shot into goal.
In 71 minutes Peter Duffield appeared as the game's first substitute
and 12 minutes later he equalised. A corner from Paul Harvey on the
right was headed on by Steve Cooper and Duffield appeared at the far
post to send a close range header past Michel Pageaud.
Then came that moment of magic from McCann.
There was just a single booking in the game when Steve Cooper was
shown the yellow card after clashing with Roddy Manley after 60 minutes.
But Sean Sweeney was fortunate that he was not red-carded in the closing
minutes when he appeared to kick Morten Wieghorst.
DUNDEE -- Pageaud, Farningham, McQueen, Manley, Wieghorst, Duffy,
Shaw, Vrto, Tosh, Hamilton, McCann. Substitutes -- Britton, Anderson,
Bain.
AIRDRIE -- Martin, Stewart, Smith, Sandison, Sweeney, Black, Boyle,
Davies, Cooper, Harvey, J McIntyre. Substitutes -- Duffield, T McIntyre,
Wilson.
Referee -- J McCluskey (Stewarton).

* SUBSTITUTE Jens Christian Madsen scored after 88 minutes last night
to give Denmark's Aalborg a 2-1 win over Panathinaikos, of Greece, their
first success in the Champions' League.
Aalborg, reinstated to Group A after Ukraine champions Dynamo Kiev
were expelled for attempting to bribe a referee, took the lead through
Erik Bo Andersen after eight minutes.
Panathinaikos equalised three minutes before the break when Polish
striker Krzysztof Warzycha's shot deflected off an Aalborg defender,
leaving goalkeeper Thomas Gill with no chance.
Referee Helmut Krug, of Germany, sent off Panathinaikos defender
Ioannis Kalitzakis after 55 minutes for a foul on Andersen.
However, substitute striker Jesper Groenkjaer produced a fine solo
effort on the left flank and sent in a cross for Madsen to hit a late
winner.

The Citizens' Theatre offered all the magic of the stage and for Ian
Goldie the experience was mesmerising.
THE celebration of the 50 years at the Citizens' Theatre is a good
time to reappraise those neglected and under-rated years of the late
fifties and early sixties.
A myth has grown up that the Citizens' before 1969 was dull,
unimaginative, and lacking adventure. Nothing could be further from the
truth. As a teenager, student, and erratic theatre-goer between 1957 and
1964, it was the Citizens' that gave me my first experience of the magic
of the theatre. Homage is long overdue to what was a wonderful company.
Shakespeare, the one tradition: granted, there was one embedded
tradition -- one Shakespeare play was offered each season. Quite
reasonable, for it gave West of Scotland fifth formers preparing Higher
English probably their only chance to enjoy Shakespeare in performance.
So we trotted to the school matinee to see Twelfth Night, with Duncan
Macrae over-the-top and hilarous as Malvolio. But my most memorable
Shakespeare was in 1962 when, a considerable sceptic with regard to the
bard's comedies, I found myself captivated and enthralled by a magical
production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Even the Scotsman had to admit
it was all ''enchanting''.
Forbidden kiss in banned play: but if Shakespeare was a staple, many
of the plays produced were modern, and occasionally, for the times,
decidedly daring. The recent furore over a lesbian kiss on television
seems strange when you consider that a ''homosexual'' kiss was exchanged
on stage in Glasgow almost 40 years ago, in the 1957 production of
Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge.
The Lord Chamberlain had banned Miller's play, but the Citizens'
decided to get round the ban by presenting it as ''a club theatre piece
to members of the Citizens' Society and their friends''. It was a
production, said one critic, ''worthy of the highest praise''.
In March 1958, the Citizens' hit trouble on two fronts with a
production of John Osborne's Look Back In Anger. Things started well.
The Glasgow Herald praised ''a play not to be missed'', while for the
Daily Mail, ''Fulton (Mackay) was superb''. But sadly, after a couple of
nights, Fulton, playing Jimmy Porter, had to withdraw because of
laryngitis and his replacement on stage had to read from a hand-held
copy of the text for the next few nights.
Brawls and tantrums: much more dramatic, however, was the reaction to
the play of former Lord Provost Sir Patrick Dollan. Sir Patrick and his
good wife walked out of the theatre, appropriately ''in anger'', and he
later explained why. ''The language is the worst I have heard on any
stage,'' he commented. ''It is typical of a brawl that might happen in
one of the slum areas of Glasgow . . . the wife seemed continually in a
tantrum.''
In addition to A View from the Bridge, Arthur Miller was represented
in March 1958 by The Crucible, ''a play not to be missed'', and a year
later by his adaptation of Ibsen's An Enemy of the People, with
''several quite first-rate performances''. (Herald)
Other highlights of those years were O'Casey's The Plough and the
Stars, Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, and Ray Lawler's Summer of the
Seventeenth Dool. All these productions were variously and rightly
described as ''excellent'', ''absorbing'', and ''first rate'', while the
acting -- and here was the key -- was often quite simply superb.
Brecht's The Good Woman of Sechzuan was produced in october 1962. The
Glasgow Herald critic quite simply found it ''impossible to do detailed
justice to the performance''.
Culmination: for me personally those great years culminated in May
1964 in the premiere of John Arden's Armstrong's Last Goodnight, and
from the start it received rave reviews. For the Daily Mail it was ''an
unrestrained collection of magnificent performances'', while the
Scotsman thought it ''a splendid product . . . a theatrical tour de
force . . . the cast is large and the laurels fall everywhere''. This
brilliant production with an outstanding cast was crowned by the
performances of Iain Cuthbertson as Armstrong, and of Leonard Maguire,
as Lindsay. Like many others, I left the theatre in total exhilaration.
Accolade from Arden: Arden himself later gave the final accolade to
the Citizens' production of his play. He wrote in a preface of how he
would like to see himself as a playwright, and how he would like his
audience to react.
''I regarded myself as preparing a story which would be told to the
audience on my behalf by the actors, which would in fact be me saying
something of interest to a whole crowd of people whom I would have liked
to believe my friends. If I personally told such a story to a group of
real friends round a supper-table I would have expected them to react,
to interrupt, to comment in a manner provocative of some more prolonged
discourse . . .
''It did happen once,'' says Arden, ''And that was the Glasgow
premiere of Armstrong's Last Goodnight where the production . . . was
under-budgeted, unevenly cast, hastily-prepared, and yet there was a
vigorous sharing of a lively experience with the audience -- it was, of
course, the experience of Scotland -- of a discontented ''region'' of
the United Kingdom aware of its historical claim to its own unique
identity and language, and aware of a theatrical reflection of that
claim upon the stage, a claim consciously projected by the actors in
response to a realised demand for it.''
Hobson's choice: shortly after, in a survey of British Theatre, Harold
Hobson of The Sunday Times concluded: ''Taken as a whole, the Citizens'
Theatre company offers the best acting I have seen in a repertory
company.''
And that was the nub. The Citizens' in those days was an extremely
strong company of Scots actors performing for, discussing and sharing
with a Scottish audience.

SHINTY'S revamped indoor six-a-side championship at Aviemore gets
under way tomorrow night with a new qualifying tournament. Play in the
new competition, which replaces last year's knockout, starts at 7pm with
eight teams in two sections of four, fighting it out for the right to
join the main tournament on Saturday.
The winners of the two mini-leagues are due to meet in a final at
9.45pm and they then face an early start in the main event which gets
under way at 9.30am on Saturday.
South teams have traditionally given best to the north, but
Inveraray's bright start in the outdoor game suggests they could cause
an upset. However, they have been drawn in difficult section along with
Fort William, who are expected to give midfielder Drew MacNeil a run,
now that he has served his seven-match ban.
Newtonmore and Kingussie have been drawn in different sections, but
could meet in a semi-final.
The main event is due to finish at 5.40pm to be followed by the
juvenile tournament. Eight teams have qualified, and two Argyll sides --
Lochnell Primary and St Columba's from Oban, are among the favourites.
Also on Friday, six under-15 teams from the Badenoch area will be
contesting a new competition to be played outdoors under floodlights at
Kingussie.
Elsewhere on Saturday, the first round of shinty's junior championship
begins. Holders Fort William feature in a preliminary tie against
Beauly. If they come through that they are away to Newtonmore.
Re-scheduled for Saturday is the north division one match between
Kinlochshiel and Strathglass at Balmacara.

Crystal Palace 2, Middlesbrough 2
JUNINHO'S Wembley dream is still alive -- just -- after Middlesbrough
salvaged a replay and their unbeaten record from a poor start at Crystal
Palace.
Bryan Robson's Brazilian star is still in South America and almost
certain to miss out on an Old Trafford debut this weekend.
''We're still waiting for his international clearance and when we get
that we will ask him to jump on the first plane,'' said Robson. ''Friday
is the first possibility he could get here and he might not even be on
that plane so it's looking unlikely for Saturday.''
Had he made it to Selhurst Park, he might have had second thoughts
about his #4.5m move from Sao Paolo as Middlesbrough flirted with
disaster against last season's double beaten semi-finalists.
Within eight minutes their tight defence had been punctured twice by
David Hopkin and if it had not been for the spirit of competition
Juninho's arrival has engendered, 'Boro might not have got back into the
game.
Nick Barmby netted his side's opener after Jan Fjortoft slipped him
the ball in the inside-right channel, and the #5.25m striker fired the
ball past Nigel Martyn.
If there was a shade of offside about that goal, Palace fans were
fuming when the flag stayed down as Craig Hignett dashed clear on to
Fjortoft's through-ball and easily slipped in the equaliser.
Late in the match Palace's Leon McKenzie had the ball in the net, but
the effort was ruled out. ''It was pulled back for holding. We've got to
go with the referee, said Palace manager Ray Lewington.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
A ROW between Lossiemouth and English non-league side Whitney Town has
left Chris Maguire without a club.
Lossiemouth cancelled the player's registration to allow him to play
for the Beazer Homes League side in a cup-tie last Wednesday night on
the understanding that he would be allowed to travel north for the Moray
side's Qualifying Cup semi-final encounter with Fraserburgh, and they
are furious that the Kentish club prevented Maguire from playing in that
match.
However, Maguire, who has moved to London, phoned Lossie manager
Fraser Kellas on the eve of Saturday's game to inform him that Whitney
were holding on to his registration, and wanted him to play for them
instead.
In fact, according to Kellas, Whitney Town had cancelled Maguire's
registration without telling him.
Kellas said: ''There is no bad feeling between Chris Maguire and
myself, but he won't play for the club again.
''The SFA have been informed, and the matter is now in the hands of
UEFA.''

EOIN Jess was yesterday rewarded with a Scotland recall after
inspiring Aberdeen to their first cup final for three years. Scotland
manager Craig Brown, who was at Hampden to see Jess's electrifying
talent completely overshadow Paul Gascoigne and clinch a place in the
Coca-Cola Cup final for the Dons, said: ''There is no way I can ignore a
player when he turns in such an outstanding performance. He'll be
playing for us in our last group qualifying tie, against San Marino next
month.
''His ability has never been in question. I have known that ever since
I brought him into the Under-21 side, but last season it looked as if
his career was going nowhere.
''I think the management team at Aberdeen, Roy Aitken and Tommy Craig,
must take great credit for resurrecting it.
''He is now much more involved in his midfield role and that is where
I visualise him with Scotland -- playing behind the front two strikers.
However, against San Marino he'll be right up front with a few others,
because they play with 10 men at the back.''
The re-emergence of Jess has been at the heart of Aberdeen's revival
this season, which has seen them go from being the whipping boys of the
premier division to major challengers for honours.
Jess is revelling in his side's return to form and said: ''Everyone
was saying before the semi-final with Rangers that it was me against
Paul Gascoigne. All I'll say is that I enjoyed the 90 minutes, but it
was a great team performance which took us through.
''Hopefully, we can now go on and beat Rangers on a more regular
basis. If we approach the final in the same way we need fear no-one.''
Manager Aitken has turned Aberdeen into hustlers in his bid to haul
them way back up among Scotland's elite, and yesterday he admitted that
reaching the cup final has forced him to put his transfer plans on hold.
Aitken, still with #1.5m remaining from the recent share issue,
insisted: ''At the moment, I am satisfied with what I am getting from my
players. The cup final is just reward for all the efforts they have put
in. We dominated and won with style against one of our main rivals.
''I know I have players with ability here. I want them on the ball as
often as possible. When they lose possession they have to hustle to get
it back.
''Personally, I'm proud to get to the final in my first year of
management. I never set any targets. I just wanted it to happen as soon
as possible.
''However, we have won nothing yet. All we have done is give ourselves
a real chance of bringing success back to the club.
''I will never take anything for granted in this game and if my
players ever needed reminding, they only have to look at what happened
to Celtic last season in the final against Raith Rovers. No matter who
we meet, they will have our total respect.
''I still think Rangers are the team to beat, because they have set
the pace for years by being consistent. It will take a collective effort
from all the contenders to catch them in the league. Now that we have
knocked them out of the cup we are aiming to stay hot on their heels.''
Aberdeen's fans were still on Cloud Nine yesterday after seeing their
team break what has been a psychological barrier since Alex Smith led
them to a cup double in 1989-90.
Neil McDougall, chairman of the Association of Aberdeen Supporters'
Clubs, said: ''We were all in the depths of despair last year when we
were beaten at Stenhousemuir in the Scottish Cup, but escaping
relegation seemed to help the players' confidence.
''You have to give Roy Aitken a lot of credit. When Willie Miller went
last season a lot of people felt Roy, as his assistant, should have gone
too. But he clearly has the players responding to him.

SUE INNES explains how the shortcomings of health care are exposed by
a photographic exhibition.
THE man with the camera has got something to say . . . Alex Anderson
was explaining the value of the project to himself. He is homeless and
learnt to take photographs as part of an innovative health and art
venture. Alex is both angry and articulate -- he was just angry before
the project began.
''It has given me three things. It taught me to use a camera. It made
me aware that I have two media to use to make a small difference with --
the camera and'' -- he gestures towards a short poem on the wall --
''words. And it's made me marshall my own energies -- so as not to stand
by and let people tread on me but to get up and demand my share. And a
share for friends of mine who are struggling.''
The Cowgate Day Centre, which he attends, has used photographs to
document the unhealthy reality of life on the streets and the limited
health provision available when you've slipped through most of the nets.
The exhibition, ''Images of Health and Sickness'', has a great deal to
say. It is part of Fotofeis '95 but also, in a small but significant
way, the NHS changes. The concepts of ''purchaser'' and ''provider'' are
controversial but at least highlight the question: what kind of health
services do people need? As health authorities are now required to make
their assessment of health needs and consequent resource decisions more
explicit the concept of a community role in that assessment has been
strengthened -- ''community'' defined both as localities but also as
user groups.
''Health needs assessment has been defined quite narrowly, to answer a
specific question such as how many hip replacements will be needed next
year,'' says Antonia Ineson, from the Lothian Health Promotion
Department, who organised the project. ''We need the expertise to assess
that -- but we also need to recognise that local groups, local
communities and individuals who use the services or who may use them in
the future have another perspective.'' Now, less than a year from
inception, the exhibition shows the experiment has been even more
successful than anyone expected. The set of black-and-white photographs
by Blackburn Young Families Project, for example, tells a story
concisely and clearly that it would take much longer to express as well
in words.
They show two days in the life of one woman bringing up young children
in the inhospitable environment which is all too familiarly a Scottish
''community'': litter on concrete, dreary, uncared-for walkways,
backdrop the immensely demanding task of caring for young children.
Bumping a buggy up and down five flights of stairs; bored weans indoors
and underfoot; the low self-image, isolation and confinement of modern
motherhood.
''You get so tired you can't be bothered with the weans, you need a
break, need someone to talk to or you crack up.''
Day two photographs are taken at the family and welfare rights centre
supported by Save the Children Fund: women drinking tea, talking and
laughing, children playing together in the creche. ''The children need
to mix with other children,'' one mother explains, ''it brings them out
and you can have a break without worrying about them. Being in the group
gives you your identity back and builds your confidence up.''
It expresses clearly the argument which we are only beginning to take
on board in this country, despite Scotland's depressing health record --
that understanding of health and illness must be much wider than the
medical definitions we are more comfortable with, and cannot be
separated from the social environment and questions of inequality and
poverty.
''Photography is a very accessible medium,'' says Clare Anderson, arts
development worker in Midlothian. ''Everybody thinks they can do it, in
a way they wouldn't with painting. And people are used to looking at
photographic images. It's creative, and something you can use to develop
different ideas.''
For the Oasis Women's Support Group it led to a powerful analysis of
how crisis and mental ill-health are rooted in life experience but made
worse by a failure to respond by health and social services. Individual
-- and harrowing -- stories are told in a clever photo-comic format.
As well as vividly communicating the essentials of each story and a
complex message about the interaction of health and life chances and
self-esteem, it is a very good way of overcoming the problem of using
such personal and exposing detail. It is an exhibition about deep
problems but also solutions. It repays the time taken to look and
listen.
* The exhibition can be seen in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh
Gallery (next to the Information Desk) until November 16, but is
available for other venues: contact Antonia Ineson, Lothian Health
Promotion Department, 61 Grange Loan, Edinburgh EH9 2ER, 0131 662 4661.

* RELATIVES or friends of those who suffer from violent mood swings,
or manic depression, don't need to be reminded of the symptoms:
early-morning rising, hyperactivity, overspending, followed by the
inevitable lows. Yesterday was Manic Depression Awareness Day,
highlighting a condition that affects about one in a 100 people at some
time in their lives. Many are highly creative people. (Spike Milligan is
one who has ''come out'' about the condition.)
However, with medication MD can be controlled successfully most of the
time. Further advances are being made through the new concept of
self-management and the MD Fellowship Scotland have just produced a
self-help booklet on the illness.
It offers guidance on how to monitor moods, and advises keeping a
daily diary. Copies are available from MD Fellowship Scotland, 19
Elmbank Street, Glasgow G2 4PB, 0141-248 3234.
* WOMEN worried about the emotional as well as the physical side of
the menopause will find a two-day course on ''The Middle Years''
helpful. Organised by Strathclyde University, the course aims to provide
a supportive atmosphere for discussion on the many changes that occur at
this time of life.
Tutors Linda McQueen and Gillian Neish have extensive experience
working with women on their personal development and they will deal with
such topics as Looking At Your Self-image, Dealing With Change, and The
Way Forward With Confidence.
The course will take place on November 18 and 19 in the Baird Hall,
Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow from 9.30am-4.30pm. The fee of #95 includes
lunch and refreshments. Further information from Libby Lamb, Strathclyde
University Continuing Education Centre, 0141-552 4400 ext 4314.
* AVOIDING certain foods, particularly animal fats, acid foods, and
sugar will help to clear the skin of psoriasis sufferers. Research
carried out over 15 years at The Alternative Centre International, in
London has shown that simple readjustment of diet can help to alleviate
some of the itching, irritation, flaking and redness associated with
this condition. For a free food fact sheet ring their helpline on
0171-381 2298.
* CHILDHOOD diabetes is likely to be preceded by a viral infection.
New research at Ruchill Hospital, Glasgow and the Royal London Hospital
found that 10 out of 15 children with newly diagnosed diabetes had
already had a viral infection compared to two out of a control group of
45.
* YET a further boost for the role of specific vitamin supplements:
new research suggests that vitamin E could help reduce the risk of heart
disease in diabetic sufferers, according to endocrinologists at
Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, says a recent report in GP magazine.
* BREAST screening has been shown to benefit women over 64 years of
age, according to a report in GP magazine. Researchers at Manchester
Breast Screening Unit found that among women who self-referred for
screening there was a detection rate of 13 per 1000. The findings
support the Health Select Committee's recommendation earlier this year
that routine screening should be expanded to women aged up to 69 years
of age.
* COUNSELLING and information for cancer suffers is available from
BACUP, the British Association of Cancer United Patients, which offers a
free telephone service on 0800 181199. The organisation also has an
office in Glasgow at 30 Bell Street, which is open five days a week from
9.00-5.30pm (0141-553 1553).
Advice booklets which have been recently updated are available free to
people with cancer, their friends and relatives. The titles include:
Feeling Better -- Controlling Pain and Other Symptoms of Cancer, Coping
With Hair Loss, Understanding Cancer of the Pancreas, and Understanding
Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplants.
* RESEARCHERS at Glasgow University have overweight taped. They say
waist circumference is an accurate measure of obesity and one that can
be easily tested. Men with a waist circumference of more than 102cm (41
inches) and women with a waist of more than 88cm (35 inches) are
overweight and should consider dieting. In the light of these findings
this simple measurement could be a useful tool as a health check,
reports Monitor Weekly.
* LACK of central heating can almost double the risk of strokes in old
people during the winter months. A study of 49 stroke patients aged 35
to 74 showed that they were more likely than the control group not to
have centrally heated homes, says a recent report in GP, the doctors'
magazine.
Another study based on elderly people in Glasgow, Paisley, Coatbridge
and Airdrie has led researchers to conclude that around 1000 people die
annually from hypothermia, well above the official figure of 300, says a
report, Urban Hypothermia In The West Of Scotland, published in the
British Medical Journal.

DENNIS Bergkamp's latest Dutch master class left Barnsley manager
Danny Wilson predicting he would bring the Premiership title to
Highbury, but the #7.5m striker is willing to wait . . . for a while.
Bergkamp's superb delicacy of touch and outstanding vision were
demonstrated yet again as he led Bruce Rioch's men over their
potentially tricky Coca-Cola Cup hurdle at Oakwell on Tuesday night.
It was the Dutchman who was responsible for Arsenal's first two goals
in their 3-0 win, rifling home the second from 22 yards, four minutes
after Dave Watson had spilled his searing free kick into Steve Bould's
path.
Bergkamp admitted things were going exactly how he had hoped after his
decision to leave Serie A to try his hand in the Premiership. ''When I
came to Arsenal, it was because I thought we could win the league. It
was important to me and when you look at the start we've made, that's
very satisfying,'' said the former Inter-Milan striker.
''But I agreed a four-year contract and want to win something during
the course of those four years, whether it comes in the first year or
the fourth is something we'll see.
''Of course, it's very early to make predictions, but the only thing
we can do at this time in the season is go out and win every game we
can.
''But there's no doubt that we've got a lot of real quality throughout
the team. Time will tell, of course, and, as I said, it's not
desperately important that we do it this year. If it comes, it comes,
but we've started well.''
Bergkamp's all-round contribution against Barnsley had Wilson purring
with pleasure. ''I thought before we played them that they would win the
championship and what I saw on Tuesday only cemented that thought in my
mind,'' said the former Northern Ireland midfielder.
''They're so very solid and composed at the back, and when they get
the chance to play football, they do so.''
The Highbury side have won eight of their last nine games --
sandwiching their only defeat of the season so far, at Chelsea -- and
Wilson said that the new-look Gunners side, with David Platt soon to
return, were frighteningly strong.
''They've always had those solid foundations at the back, but Bruce
has added that extra flair to them and in Bergkamp he's got an extra
dimension,'' said Wilson.
''Bergkamp is just class. As a defender, you're always on your heels
against him, because you know he pops up everywhere, and when he gets
the ball, he's just so confident in his ability.
''He can look after himself as well. Some of our defenders kicked him
up the backside, so he left his foot in occasionally. He wanted them to
know he was there and that's part and parcel of the game, but it's one
of the reasons why they'll finish up on top.''
Bergkamp's goal was his sixth of the season and with fellow striker
Ian Wright already having 11 to his name, the partnership is already
looking to provide all that Rioch had hoped for.
Bergkamp said he was really enjoying working alongside the man whose
England career seems over despite his consistency in the Premiership.
''The good thing about playing with Ian is that when I get the ball, I
know I can play it into him,'' said the Dutchman.
''I think it's a partnership that's good for both of us. Ian wants to
have somebody around him who can feed him and I need somebody in front
of me who I can find. It's going well.''

Stoke City 0, Newcastle United 4
THE fine skills of David Ginola and Peter Beardsley eased Newcastle
United into the last 16 of the Coca-Cola Cup, as Les Ferdinand wrote
himself into the club's record books.
Beardsley gave a vintage display which included the first-half double
that turned a tricky task against Stoke City into a stroll. With
Ginola's dazzling footwork driving Lou Macari's team to distraction --
and defender Ian Clarkson to the dressing room with a second booking
before the interval -- Kevin Keegan's men did not have to break sweat.
But their brand of football allowed the dynamic Anglo-French duo to
have a hand as Ferdinand set a new post-War club record when he scored
for the eight consecutive match, taking his tally to 16 in just 13
matches.
Newcastle opened the scoring after 30 minutes when a Beardsley drive
flashed into a bottom corner. The second came after 39 minutes when
Robert Lee fed Beardsley, who ran made no mistake from close range.
After the break, Beardsley teamed up with Keith Gillespie, whose pass
found Ferdinand, who netted.
Darren Peacock does not score too many goals but the defender was on
target for the fourth when he crashed the ball home from just outside
the box.
After the match Stoke manager Macari launched an attack on Ginola,
saying that he felt Clarkson had been the victim of Ginola's penchant
for throwing himself to the floor.
''He was flying through the air when Clarkson came from behind him,''
said Macari. ''I didn't agree with either booking. ''Every time Ginola
got the ball I was waiting for him to dive and he did it once in the
second half when there was nobody near him.''

SCOTLAND'S Colin McRae heads for the final round of the FIA World
Rally Championship in Britain next month knowing that the title is
within his grasp.
Second place on the Rallye Catalunya Costa Brava -- Spain's round of
the world series -- gave the Lanark driver sufficient points to share
the championship lead with his 555 Subaru team-mate Carlos Sainz.
The Spaniard emerged as winner of the three-day, 1660 kilometre event
yesterday after McRae and co-driver Derek Ringer intentionally incurred
a road penalty to comply with team orders imposed when world
championship leader Juha Kankkunen crashed out of the rally on Tuesday,
while leading.
''It made sense,'' said a jubilant McRae. '' After all, if we fought
between ourselves for first place, one of us may well have pushed a
little too hard and we could have lost some very valuable points in the
manufacturers' championship.
''As it is, Carlos and I now head for the final round equal on points
-- it will certainly make the RAC Rally incredibly exciting.''
On his first attempt at the Lloret de Mar-based rally, McRae delivered
a stunning performance, finishing nine seconds ahead of 1992 winner
Sainz on special stage times.
But by deliberately reporting one minute late at the time control
after the twenty-third and final time stage, McRae incurred a one minute
time penalty.
Later, there was more controversy Didier Auriol was disqualified for a
technical infringement on his car.
After Auriol's disqualification for an illegal turbo restrictor,
French Ford driver Francois Delecour -- who drove for three stages with
no clutch -- moved up to fourth place. Final positions:
1, C Sainz/L Moya (Spain) Subaru Impreza, 5hr 5min 49sec; 2, C McRae/D
Ringer (Britain) Subaru Impreza, 5-06-58; 3, P Liatti/A Alessandrini
(Italy), Subaru Impreza, 5-07-56; 4, F Delecour/C Francois (France),
Ford Escort, 5-08-38.
Drivers standings -- 1, McRae and Sainz, both 70 points; 3, J
Kankkunen (Finland) 62; 4, D Auriol (France) 51.

Winter and festive breaks are available far and wide, reports Andrew
Douglas
ON Monday first, Christmas Day will be but 56 days or eight weeks
distant. It is virtually impossible to escape the holly and the ivy with
shops, stores and the media bringing an almost daily reminder. Many
people make a New Year's resolution to ''get away from it all next
Christmas'' but when the time approaches, those earlier-made promises
often remain on the starting blocks.
For those who decided in January that this Christmas would be
different there is a huge variety of interesting and inviting places
that await to indulge you in festive cheer. When looked at in balance,
hotels and guesthouses offer excellent value for money in their
Christmas packages.
It is really a time of the year when hassle should ideally be on a
back burner but because of various factors it seems particularly
difficult to avoid. There are often disputes among the family about
whose turn it is to host the Christmas dinner and unless you are in a
household that has gone disposable there will always be a mountain of
dishes to wash.
By getting away for a few days of bliss you can turn your back on
cooking, washing-up and the slog around the shops for provisions. Apart
from the reduction of tension there is the financial saving, which is
often vast, on the amount of food bought-in for the festive period.
This year, with Christmas Day falling on a Monday, it makes for the
ideal extended weekend break. And hotels and guesthouses have specially
formulated packages that fit most people's needs. By going away from
home, children need not feel concerned about being left out -- parties,
entertainment and games feature on most hotels' itineraries.
Christmas-time in hotels is largely about gala dinners or balls, carol
singing and fun-filled evenings. And whether your whim is to slouch by a
large log fire or take part in a sporting activity, or both, there is
such a variety of hotel and guesthouses in different locations that will
perfectly suit your needs.
And depending on where you are, festive entertainment provided may
take the form of a Highland gathering, ceilidh, treasure hunt or cruise.
A typical Christmas break may start with sherry before dinner on
Christmas Eve, transport to local watchnight services, followed by a
warm punch on return.
Christmas Day has traditional dinner with musicians, a surprise
present for guests, followed by games. The flavour of Scotland on some
itineraries comes to the fore on Boxing Day with Scottish dinner and
ceilidh.
Scotland's scenery doesn't go into hiding in the winter, and although
the days are shorter, its majestic mountains and rich heritage still
offer much appeal. In the weeks before Christmas, hotels and guesthouses
work flat out to attract guests with short-break packages which
represent excellent value for money.
Amid all of the joy and merry-making there is still space for a little
murder, mystery and suspense. And for those who fancy trying their hand
at a spot of detective work there are a number of hotels offering
mystery under the mistletoe.
A classic programme begins with pre-dinner cocktails, allowing time to
mingle with other guests and those who take part in the plot. As the
story thickens and time marches through meals the hunt for the
''killer'' goes on until on day three the story reveals whodunnit. The
whole break is so designed that it provides the perfect opportunity to
integrate with other guests and make new friends.
For those who wish to travel farther afield there is again a choice of
holidays and venues that will provide a break with a complete
difference. Typical of this is a seven-day coach holiday to the Austrian
Tyrol.
Departing on December 22, the journey is broken in France for an
overnight stop thus making a longish trip tolerable. But the holiday
really starts at the hotel in the Tyrol where on Christmas Eve you can
get some last-minute gifts in Innsbruck. On Christmas Day take a morning
sleigh ride followed by a glass of gluhwein and then enjoy festivities
Austrian-style with a traditional Christmas dinner.
Optional tours and folklore evening are included as is dinner and
continental breakfast in Austria in the price of #299.
If you are a heatseeker a similar coach holiday will whisk you across
the Channel, through France and into Spain. Salou is your destination
and five nights full board in a three-star hotel, 300 metres from the
beach awaits you. On Christmas Day a gala dinner with turkey and all the
trimmings is served buffet-style.
Departure date is December 22 and the cost of #219 per person includes
certain excursions and entertainment. If you wish to extend your stay to
include New Year the cost is #299.
Christmas shopping can be more enjoyable if it is incorporated in a
short break. For #84 per person you could get all your shopping in one
weekend with a two-night city centre stay in London plus a day-trip to a
French hypermarket. One company is offering seven departures between now

THE thirty-fifth and final counting tournament for the 1995 European
order of merit, the Volvo Masters, begins today at Valderrama and by the
time the destiny of the Harry Vardon Trophy is decided on Sunday between
three players, the course may have to be renamed Valde-drama.
For the plot is worthy of fiction. One of these three players, and
three alone, can prevail -- each in personality, background, attitude
and method totally different from one another, in itself a commendation
of the tour that its membership is drawn, as every political party
claims, from a broad church.
First Sam Torrance, he of the school of pencil behind the ear, roll
your own cigarette, enjoy a pint (or twain), and play a frame or two of
snooker. Aged 42, Torrance leads the race by a meagre #3829 and, never
the winner, in his twenty-fifth season on the tour probably has his foot
on the rail in the last-chance saloon.
Second, Colin Montgomerie, the leading money-winner for the last two
years, who has all the virtues and flaws of the public school and
university-educated middle-class product. Aged 32, his uncompromising
expectations of himself have as often worked against his fortunes as for
them.
Third, Bernhard Langer, within #60,000 of Torrance going into a
tournament in which #125,000 is the first prize. Aged 38, his infinite
and unrepentant capacity for taking pains and, apparently taking forever
to size up putts, might have made him a prime example to be made of by
the new slow-play rule.
The simple story of the plot is that if Torrance finishes ahead of
Montgomerie and Langer is not in the top two, Torrance will win. If
Langer retained his Masters title Torrance or Montgomerie would have to
be second to prevent the German from overtaking them. In all the
circumstances, Torrance will surely be the choice of sentiment.
In retrospect two incidents this past season may yet turn out to have
a bearing on the outcome. In March Torrance was disqualified in the
Portuguese Open and this month Montgomerie withdrew after the first
round of the German Masters in deference to his injured left hand -- not
only costly in mere monetary terms.
But all three have reached an accommodation with the 6819-yard course,
whose superbly maintained condition and the challenging nature of whose
holes place it among the foremost tests on the European Tour. That
element alone in an already fascinating equation allows them to start
from, as it were, a level playing field.
Langer last year shot an incredible 62, nine under par, in the second
round and also has been eighth, third and fourth. Montgomerie's last
three finishes have been fourth, first and second, in 1992 beaten in a
play-off by Sandy Lyle. Torrance's best performance by far was to be
second by a stroke five years ago.
As a final piece of analysis Torrance in 1995 has won three times in
25 tournaments, Langer three times in 14, and Montgomerie twice in 19
outings. They also have in common health problems, for Torrance is
seldom without an ailment, Montgomerie has that dodgy hand, and Langer a
suspect back.
Be all that as it may, Torrance disdains any fatigue factor. ''This is
the biggest tournament of my life,'' he said yesterday, ''and I'm ready
for it, physically and mentally. If I can't get up for this one, I might
as well chuck it. There's no more pressure on me than there was in the
Ryder Cup and I came through that.''
Montgomerie has been told that he just needs to give the strained
tendon between his left thumb and forefinger a rest, yet he still
intends fulfilling his commitment to five more tournaments this year.
''It puts me at a slight disadvantage,'' he admitted, ''but the reality
is that the whole situation takes you over.''
Langer, who took last week off, naturally sees himself as the
underdog. ''Colin is the most consistent all-rounder in the game,'' he
said, ''and Sam's driving and putting have improved greatly this
season.''
But he would not be unmindful that two years ago Montgomerie came into
this tournament a similar distance behind Nick Faldo and won both it and
the order of merit.
Of course, there are any number among the field of 54 -- which
includes all but Faldo and Severiano Ballesteros of the victorious
European Ryder Cup team -- who could slip past the three principals if
their preoccupation with the order of merit contest were to distract
them. Andrew Coltart and Lyle represent the remainder of the Scottish
interest.
The three main players have already qualified for the Johnnie Walker
world championship in Jamaica just before Christmas, for which this
tournament represents the last opportunity in Europe for gaining a place
in the sun.

COVENTRY City produced a stunning second-half comeback to send
Tottenham crashing out of the Coca-Cola Cup at Highfield Road last
night.
Spurs' #4.5m striker Chris Armstrong added to his first Premiership
score for the club at the weekend with a second-minute opener, and David
Busst's own goal after 18 minutes seemed to have put the Londoners well
on course for the fourth round.
However, Peter Ndlovu raised City's hopes with a penalty 10 minutes
after half-time, and Busst made amends for his earlier slip by heading
an equaliser six minutes later.
John Salako then completed a marvellous Coventry fightback, firing the
winner 14 minutes from time.
Liverpool piled on the agony for Premiership strugglers Manchester
City with a 4-0 victory at Anfield. John Scales added to City's problem
of conceding early goals with strike after 10 minutes and Robbie
Fowler's tenth of the season after 74 minutes opened the floodgates,
with Ian Rush and Steve Harkness leaving the basement Blues well beaten.
Paul Barnes, a two-goal hero in York's 3-0 win at Manchester United in
round two, took just 10 minutes to put the second division side ahead at
Queens Park Rangers with his eleventh score of the season.
But the visitors' advantage lasted just 14 minutes, England Under-21
winger Trevor Sinclair adding to his growing reputation with an
equaliser before Andy Impey's strike and Paul Atkin's own goal 10
minutes later sent Rangers through 3-1.
Leeds' Gary Speed gave his side victory against Derby at the Baseball
Ground, while Aston Villa ended Stockport's hopes of equalling their
best performance in the competition -- they reached the fourth round for
the only time in 1973 -- with a 2-0 victory.
Defender Ugo Ehiogu settled the Villa Park faithful with a opener
after 58 minutes, Dwight Yorke adding a second eight minutes later.
Sheffield Wednesday killed off Millwall's hopes of repeating their
second-round victory over Everton, Mark Pembridge putting the
Premiership side ahead and Guy Whittingham making sure.
Neil Shipperley sent Southampton through with a winner 11 minutes from
time against West Ham at The Dell, while Bradford, conquerors of
Nottingham Forest, held Norwich to a goalless draw.
Graham Taylor's Wolves saw their season continue to misfire as first
division rivals Charlton forced a goalless draw in front of more than
22,000 at Molineux.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
JOHN Lambie reckons the signing of former Ranger Stuart Munro can turn
Falkirk's season around.
Munro made his debut in the win over Raith Rovers at Stark's Park last
week, the Brockville side's first win in nine league games.
And Lambie believes his experience will be a major factor in the
Bairns' back-line this term.
He said: ''To bring a player of his quality to Falkirk is a major
boost for the club. Stuart's introduction gives us a nice balance to the
defence. Also, he can keep others concentrating on their game because he
is a such a good talker on the pitch.
''Funnily enough, with Stuart's arrival at the club, it gives us more
options going forward. We had lost the attacking drive of David Elliot
because I'd been forced to play him at right-back. Now, we can put David
back into the left-side of midfield which suits him better.''
Munro will play his second match in Falkirk colours in Saturday's
clash with Hearts at Brockville.
It's a vital match for the Bairns as they have a chance to move away
from the foot of the premier division table.
Lambie believes it is vital that the players continue where they left
off last week.
He said: ''I always said all we needed was a little rub of the green
and we got it against Raith with the bad back-pass that led to our goal.
''But it's important the players don't rest on their laurels. We must
keep it going.''
* RAITH Rovers and Wycombe Wanderers have failed to reach agreement on
a fee for defender Jason Rowbotham, who recently moved to the English
second division club under freedom of contract.
A compensation tribunal will now sit to decide the fee.
* DUNFERMLINE manager Bert Paton is being forced into the transfer
market because of injuries.
Yesterday, midfield player Craig Robertson and reserve goalkeeper Ian
Westwater were added to the injury list, bringing the total number of
players doubtful for the match against Dundee United on Saturday to
nine.
''This is one of the worst set of injuries I have ever had,'' said
Paton. ''I am now forced to sign a utility player before the end of the
week. I have my eye on two and I hope to sign one of them.''
* DINO Zoff, the former Italy captain who is now chairman of Lazio,
was yesterday questioned by a magistrate as part of an inquiry into
suspected sales tax evasion at the Serie A club.
Magistrate Davide Jori heard Zoff, accompanied by his lawyer, as a
material witness in the investigation into alleged unpaid VAT on advance
ticket sales between 1991 and 1994.
Zoff, who took over in 1994, told the magistrate that some tax was not
paid since he became chairman, but Lazio had asked the finance ministry
to determine whether the sales involved were liable to tax.

THE Scottish Amateur Swimming Association has thrown away a television
opportunity by deciding to incorporate the Scottish Sprint Championships
into the Scottish Winter Championships at Ayr in December.
Staged annually in November since 1989, the sprints were the only
Scottish swimming event to gain regular TV coverage in recent years, and
apparently there was already a sponsor in place for next month.
However, Martyn Woodroffe, the Director of Scottish Swimming, said:
''In November, swimmers should be tapering down in preparation for the
Winter Championships and it seemed sensible to put the two meets
together.
''Last year we did not get much coverage so television was not a major
issue in the decision.''

MARK Ramprakash spared England's blushes last night, but could not
fully cover the cracks already created by a sub-standard team
performance. Ramprakash's undefeated 89 allowed the tourists to overhaul
Eastern Transvaal's total of 261 for five with one of their 50 overs
remaining.
But a day-night contest against a team not rated good enough to play
in top-flight South African domestic cricket on a regular basis
confirmed that there is plenty of hard work ahead this winter for
England.
Ramprakash struck only four boundaries but still made his runs from
only 93 balls and already looks like a man determined to achieve a
breakthrough on this trip.
England had started their run-chase spectacularly, reaching 68 for one
in under 12 overs, despite losing Alec Stewart for eight to a catch to
mid-wicket.Graeme Hick was chiefly responsible for the early spurt,
top-edging and pulling 6s to third man and long leg respectively during
an over from Barbadian Sam Skeete that also saw Atherton given the
benefit of the doubt -- wrongly as it happened -- following a run-out
appeal.
But any thougts of a victory stroll disappeared once Hick skied a
return catch to Graham Stevenson and Corrie Jordaan -- a Robbie Coltrane
lookalike from hips to neck -- sent back Atherton and Graham Thorpe in
quick succession. Jordaan had Atherton stumped off his slow left-armers
and then won an lbw decision against Thorpe. At 119 for four, England
were wobbling badly, but Robin Smith and Ramprakash steadied their side
with a stand of 46.
But there was still plenty to do when Smith lost a tight run-out
decision. Ramprakash, crucially dropped at mid-on off Jordaan when 50,
and Dominic Cork managed it with their unbroken stand of 99 in 14 overs.
Earlier, Atherton's attack was treated with disdain at times as Wayne
Radford roared to 92 from 118 deliveries while hitting a 6, pulled off
Richard Illingworth, and ten 4s. It was Illingworth who eventually
parted the openers, defeating Mitchley's attempted sweep immediately
after the left-hander had been spilled in the deep by Hick, diving
forward.
Eastern Transvaal 261 for 5 (W R Radford 92, C Grainger 58no), England
264 for 5 (M R Ramprakash 89no).
* INDIA crawled to 54 for the loss of opener Ajay Jadeja in the 168
minutes possible on a rain-shortened opening day to the second Test
against New Zealand in Madras. Moonsoon rain delayed the start of the
match and bad light forced the sides off the field early after just 35.3
overs.
Opener Manoj Prabhakar batted throughout, remaining unbeaten on 19
from 110 balls. Navjot Sidhu had scored 18 off 72 deliveries. Jadeja
never looked comfortable during his 58 minutes at the crease and was
bowled for three by a full-pitched delivery from paceman Dion Nash.

NICK Price, who dominated Southern Hills Country Club in a
record-breaking show at the 1994 PGA Championship, is back this week
through ''a lucky break'' for a run at the Tour Championship.
Greg Norman is in line to snare the season's top honours, while Price,
who won the 1994 PGA by six strokes, is the thirtieth man in the 30-man
field at the championship starting today, when the winner will take home
$540,000.
Price, who stands more than $1m behind No.1 Norman on the money list,
was a crucial $18.88 ahead of the player in thirty-first place, Jeff
Sluman, who missed the cut at last week's Texas Open.
Nick Faldo, the subject of much tabloid attention in the wake of the
announcement that he and his wife Gill are separating, eluded reporters
at his hotel yesterday, sneaking out the back entrance and heading for
practice.
* BILL Lockie, Scotland's national coach for amateurs, gave a

CHAMPIONS Australia yesterday hit back at accusations that coach Bobby
Fulton launched a verbal attack on director of referees Greg McCallum at
the end of Sunday's World Cup semi-final against New Zealand.
Fulton, whose team won 30-20 after extra time, is expected to be
called before International Board officials following the comments he is
alleged to have made. If found guilty, he faces a hefty fine and/or a
reprimand.
It is claimed he had approached McCallum, himself an Australian, in an
aggressive manner and said: ''It's a carve-up; you are responsible and
it's a slight on your name.''
World Cup tournament director Maurice Lindsay said: ''It would be a
shame to detract from a magnificent semi-final, but we cannot let the
matter go without investigation.''
But Aussie manager Geoff Carr, who has lodged a formal complaint,
saying that English referee Russell Smith ''clearly refereed one team in
the second half,'' insisted that Fulton did not verbally abuse McCallum.
The Kangaroos have also been criticised for allowing their
water-carriers to wear bright red sweatshirts which bore the logo of a
tobacco company, breaking the tournament rules.
Meanwhile, Australia have named an unchanged line-up for Saturday's
final against England at Wembley.

STEFAN Edberg, who joined Ivan Lendl, Jimmy Connors, and John McEnroe
in the record books this week, was brought down to earth yesterday by
world No.2 Pete Sampras in the Essen Open in Germany.
Former Wimbledon champion Edberg, who joined the illustrious trio as
the fourth man to have played 1000 senior matches on the Tour, was swept
out of the high-class event by Sampras in a 6-3, 6-2 second-round
defeat.
Edberg took pride in reaching the milestone after Tuesday's
first-round victory but the Swede, who has slipped to No.23 in the
rankings, knows that time is catching up with him.
''I've had the best years of my career,'' the former world No.1
admitted. ''But I can still produce some good tennis.''
The American needed a few games to get into his rhythm in his opening
game. But once he found his touch he rarely looked like losing.
British No.1 Greg Rusedski bowed out 6-4, 6-4 to No.10 seed Marc
Rosset, of Switzerland. Results:
R Krajicek (Netherlands) beat B Steven (USA) 6-3, 6-4; A Medvedev

FRANK Bruno will fight any legal action to get his big-money clash
with Mike Tyson. That was made clear yesterday by Bruno's promoter Frank
Warren, following Tuesday's High Court writ issued by British rival and
former champion Lennox Lewis.
The Lewis camp insist their fighter is the rightful opponent for
Bruno's first World Boxing Council heavyweight title defence. But
Tyson's installation as the WBC's No.1 contender has thrown the whole
issue into dispute.
Lewis beat Lionel Butler in a final eliminator -- as ordered by the
WBC -- which, insist his handlers, should give him a direct route to the
title.
But Warren said yesterday: ''As far as Frank Bruno is concerned, this
will be fought very strongly. Why they are issuing proceedings against
Bruno is beyond me.
''Frank doesn't make the decisions -- it is the World Boxing Council.
By trying to injunct him, all they are doing is spurring him on, because
we are determined to make this fight (against Tyson).
''Bruno is determined and I am wondering if a British court has
jurisdiction over the WBC as they are registered in Puerto Rico.''
The decisions that have brought this heavyweight row to a head were
made at the WBC's last convention in Seville nearly a year ago.
Not only did they order the Lewis-Butler eliminator, but decreed that
Tyson would move back to the No.1 position after his first warm-up
fight, although they took that step ahead of schedule.
Lewis' solicitor Bernard Clarke issued proceedings against Bruno and
the WBC in the attempt to head off any u-turn which may be made at the
WBC's next convention in Chan Mai, Thailand, starting on November 6.
* RICHIE Woodhall won a tough points decision over Zdrakvo Kostic in
Telford last night to retain his European middleweight title.
Woodhall, the official challenger for both the WBC and WBO crowns,
will now be looking for a tilt at the world title.

South Schools Under-18 8, Glasgow Schools Under-18 7
A LATE penalty cost Glasgow success in their first match of the
inter-district campaign at Philiphaugh yesterday.
After having missed three early awards, Galashiels Academy stand-off
Chris Paterson kicked his fourth effort between the uprights with just
three minutes of the match remaining.
This proved a cruel twist of fate for Glasgow, who enjoyed large
periods of pressure in the home half and scored a fine try by centre
Michael Loakman, of St Aloysius College, to put them into the driving
seat.
After a scoreless first-half South took the lead through centre Dougal
Affleck, just five minutes into the second half. Paterson missed the
conversion.
His opposite number Craig Hodgkinson, from the High School of Glasgow,
kicked what looked like being the match-winning points by converting
Loakman's score after 48 minutes, but the Glasgow side did not reckon on
the South's spirited fightback. Glasgow won the Under-16 match 19-13.
South Schools U-18 -- B Ruthven; G Dorricott, D Affleck, G McGarva, J
Downie; C Paterson, R Chrystie; P Bramhall, D Cornwall, B Finn, D
Sumner, M Wilson, A Thompson, S McMillan, P Cockburn. Replacements -- W
Mitchell for Cornwall, A Stevenson for McMillan.
Glasgow Schools U-18 -- P Cumming; A Campbell, M Loakman, A Gibbon, F
McQuarrie; C Hodgkinson, G Clarke; C di Ciacca, A Lawson, A Lamont, M
McColl, T Boyd, M Facenna, G Howieson, N Scullion.

GHK fans will be forced to split their collective loyalties on
Saturday when the two constituent elements of the amalgam -- Glasgow
High School and Kelvinside Academy -- meet at Anniesland in a fixture
that has produced near parity over the past five or six years.
''We are expecting a sizeable crowd for the match,'' said Roddy Moir,
coach of Kelvinside Academy first XV who is aware that Glasgow High go
into the match fresh from a tour to Spain during the October break.
''That should give them something of an advantage,'' stated Moir, who
has a relatively young side this season.
Only five of the boys are in sixth year, nine are in fifth year, and
one (Chris Potham, the stand-off) in fourth year.
That lack of experience might explain the narrow margins by which they
have lost four matches this season, notably the 18-17 defeat by
Merchiston.
On the credit side, Kelvinside achieved an impressive 35-21 victory
over Stewart's-Melville College and a 31-17 win against Galashiels
Academy.
In November, Kelvinside have some tough matches, against Dundee High
School (4), Loretto (11), St Aloysius College (18), and Fettes (25).

RUGBY Football Union secretary Tony Hallett has revealed there is no
English commitment to join the European Rugby Cup next year.
ITV today secured the television rights for the first three years of
the competition, which begins next week and includes club teams from
Wales, Ireland, France, Italy, and Romania.
When details of the multi-million pound deal were announced, it was
believed that it would be on the proviso that English clubs would enter
the event next season.
But Hallett and the rest of the Twickenham hierarchy have little faith
in the tournament as it stands, with 15 matches in four pools
culminating in a grand final early next year.
The Scottish Rugby Union have not yet decided on the format for
Scottish representation. Director of rugby Jim Telfer is keen for
District sides, as in Ireland, to be the Scottish representatives while
some clubs, notably Watsonians and Melrose, are pressing for clubs to
fly the saltire in Europe.
Hallett said: ''We strongly support the concept of English clubs in
Europe, but we feel that this competition has not got the high profile
and organisation that will gain either the money or the public
excitement that it deserves.
''We don't want to pour any cold water on their efforts, because in
principle we are with them, but we think the competition could be better
and when it is, we will join a European competition or create one
ourselves.
''The European concept is excellent and we are very interested in it,
but we want to enter one that is viable, will take off and will be value
for money for the game.''
Hallett insisted: ''We have certainly made no commitment for next year
-- or to this competition. It is supposed to be a five-nation event, but
two of the traditional five nations -- England and Scotland -- are not
taking part this year.''
English indifference failed to put off ITV, who have already signed up
for their third successive World Cup in 1999.
The inaugural tournament will feature Farul Constanta (Romania);
Benetton Treviso and Milan (Italy); Toulouse, Castres and Begles
(France); Munster, Ulster and Leinster (Ireland) and Cardiff, Pontypridd
and Swansea from Wales.
The competition kicks off in Romania on October 31 when the home club
champions, Farul Constanta, entertain French double winners Toulouse.
In the opening stages, each team will play two matches in a designated
three-team pool, with the winners going through to the semi-finals on
December 30. The final, provisionally arranged for Cardiff Arms Park,
will take place on January 7, 1996. Pools:
Pool A: Benetton Treviso, Farul Constanta, Toulouse. Pool B:
Begles-Bordeaux, Cardiff, Ulster. Pool C: Leinster, Milano, Pontypridd.
Pool D: Castres, Munster, Swansea.

* ENGLAND No.8 Dean Richards warned yesterday that his country's Five
Nations Championship prospects could suffer because of the new yellow
card system.
Richards will return to captain Leicester this weekend after becoming
the first player to be banned under the new arrangement, by which
players receive a suspension for two cautions, even if they are incurred
in separate matches.
Speaking in London -- where he was launching his autobiography,
entitled Deano -- the 30-year-old said: ''England might lose two or
three players throughout the Five Nations, whereas the other countries
have not put in place such a harsh system.
''Unfortunately referees have been told to penalise virtually
everything, which is totally outrageous. There is a stoppage about every
15 seconds in some matches.''

JIMMY White must wait another month at least before ending his major
title drought after a 5-2 defeat by defending champion John Higgins in
the Skoda Grand Prix quarter-finals in Sunderland last night.
The Scot silenced another partisan crowd with a brilliant potting
exhibition to take him into the last four of the event.
White showed flashes of his old form, but he still looks some way
short of his best.
''I missed a few balls and John punished me severely,'' said the world
No.7, whose next tournament will be the UK Championship in Preston --
snooker's second most prestigious event.
''It was an aggressive type of game and I wanted to be part of it. I
just went for a couple too many.''
Higgins set the tone for a rapid match with a break of 86 in the first
frame, but White treated a packed crowd to some vintage play to lead
2-1, including a break of 100 in the third frame.
Undeterred, Higgins hit back with 82 and it was all square by the
interval.
White, who had won two of their three previous matches, made the early
inroads in frame five, but he missed a long red to allow Higgins back to
the table.
The Wishaw-based man needed only one visit, clearing the table with 93
to nose in front for the first time since the opening frame.
There was no way back for White as Higgins added a run of 84 in the
sixth frame and with three reds remaining in the seventh, White conceded
when trailing 59-0.
Higgins, who meets Alan McManus over the best of 17 frames in the
semi-finals on Friday, said: ''That's probably the best I have played
this season.''
''When I went 3-2 up, I wanted to see if he could handle the pressure,
because he looked back to his old form at 2-1.
''But I didn't really give him a chance. I don't feel under any extra
pressure being defending champion. The other players are under as much
as me.''
McManus reached the semi-finals of a ranking competition for the first
time in 12 months with a 5-1 drubbing of Northern Ireland's Joe Swail.
''I didn't feel I was capable of competing for trophies until
recently,'' said McManus, who for the third match in a row dropped only
one frame. ''It remains to be seen whether I can win a tournament again,
but it makes a big difference to feel I am in with a chance.''

DEVELOPERS are keen to re-enter Glasgow's office market, but are being
restricted by the lack of funding available from the banks.
Although the city centre is running out of quality modern office space
there is unlikely to be any significant addition to the current stock,
since any new development will be restricted to sites and buildings
already owned by institutions.
As a result, landlords may be able to start reducing incentives for
tenants, followed by rental growth. These are the key conclusions of
October's issue of Ryden's Commercial Property Review, which is
published twice yearly.
The review points out that although the banks have recently been more
willing to lend to the property sector: ''It may be that the banks'
stance towards property will have to be relaxed further before the
property investment market begins to flourish.''
The report also highlights a slow-down in activity in Edinburgh's
office sector. Take-up of space in the six months to September 1995 was
280,826 sq ft, compared with 443,153 sq ft in the previous ''abnormally
high'' six-month period.
Best performer of the year was Scotland's industrial sector with a
total return of 12.1%, compared with 9.5% for retail. As the only sector
to underperform the UK average, offices had a poor year with a negative
total return of -2.3%.

A WEEK after the SRU were being
told to think of themselves as a type of bird for marketing purposes,
the Diary is delighted to bestow upon the said union the Dodo of the
Year award for complete and utter nincumpoopery.
As you all know, a big dinner is to be held at Murrayfield in early
November to raise funds for Mike Biggar, the former Scotland captain who
was injured in a car crash. All the players named in the book The Famous
Fifteen, and a galaxy of others, will be there.
Ian Robertson, the broadcaster and one of the principal organisers of
the event, had the idea of auctioning a set of real Scotland jerseys
with ''Famous Fifteen'' embroidered beneath the thistle and autographed
by all of the famous players in the recent book of the same name. The
tome purports to have picked the best team ever to have played for
Scotland, which is a load of nonsense as you will be aware, because me
and Jim Aitken aren't in it, but a real collector's item nevertheless.
''I liked the idea of auctioning all of those jerseys, seeing all of
those hands in the air, and knowing the money was going to Mike,''
Robertson told us.
The manufacturers of the real Scotland strip were delighted to oblige.
Bill Hogg was all for it, but others in the SRU have said ''no'' because
they say embroidering ''Famous Fifteen'' beneath the thistle infringes
some merchandising agreement or other.
Laura Dick of the SRU said: ''It's not a recognised team picked by the
SRU. We couldn't let it happen.''
I understand there may be an alternative -- a plain blue jersey --
but, my goodness, isn't this all a bit petty.
* TROUBLED GHK don't have their problems to seek and, despite the
probable return to action of Shade Munro this weekend and the arrival of
former Scotland and Glasgow High centre Mike Hunter from Cartha as the
backs' coach, their woes have been added to with the news that Alan Watt
is to be out until the new year at the earliest.
''I've done my symphysis pubis, which is an injury usually sustained
by women giving birth, or from sudden impact in a car crash,'' Watt
confided to the Diary after a pregnant pause. ''I played when I could
hardly run, and I kept feeling this pulling sensation. After the Currie
game, I couldn't even sit up in bed.''
The symphysis pubis is where the pelvis joins together at the front
and it is sometimes rent asunder during child-birth. The Diary wonders
why Wattie was wanting to sit up in bed -- was he alone or with somebody
for instance -- and are GHK now going to get the post-natal classes for
their team that many have been suggesting for some time they should have
been making use of?
The Diary understands a second XV player was rushed from the pitch to
Bellshill Maternity on Saturday. Only joking.
* THE mighty Iain Paxton seems to be doing some job as coach of
Glenrothes, who remain undefeated in the leagues this season, and we
hear that the club are trying to get the 1984 Grand Slam No.8 to play
this Saturday because of a plethora of back-row injuries. Paxton, a
devastating 37-year-old, can still turn it on.
Paxton gave up playing last season, when some storming displays
included coming off the bench to give away six penalties in three
minutes, but his club are particularly proud of the occasion, and the
opposition have to remain nameless, when two cheeky chappies decided to
hold on to the British Lion's shirt at a lineout, only to be discovered
later lying in a dreadful mess after a ruck had broken up.
Much as it hurts the Diary to say it, Paxton was some player, and what
an example he is setting by going back to coach his junior club.
* KENNY Milne, who some are suggesting might still come out of
retirement if asked to because of injuries elsewhere, was, he says,
rather hoping that Heriot's would have been either definitely relegated,
or safe, at this stage in the season.
The reason? He had a rod booked on the Tay last Saturday and had to
give it up to help his side beat Hawick, whereupon his replacement on
the river caught a 16lb salmon.
The Diary thinks that there's something vaguely perverse about holding
on to something with two hands and dangling it in the water, but there
you have it. One hooker to another, no doubt.
* I HEAR bottom-of-the-table Gala are getting a new German player.
He's called Jurgen Doonson.
Under influence of orange
KEVIN McKenzie and Stewart Hamilton of Stirling County were talented
and welcome guests at the Glasgow Accies Mini Rugby dinner on Monday, a
night of revelry on nothing more thanorange juice and hamburgers.
McKenzie spoke eloquently of his drive to become one of the strongest
men in the game and a quiet hush descended as he spoke of his want to be
the No.1 hooker.
Hamilton, who scored County's decisive try against Watsonians on
Saturday and will be 40 next birthday, scanned the sea of expectant
young faces and told them of his great influences in rugby. Hamilton,
originally from Larkhall, further delighted his young fans with a
history of his own rugby career, a game which he didn't start until he
was 22.
''In fact . . .'' he said looking at the group of 11-year-olds hanging
on his every word, ''. . . when I was your age I was in a flute band.''
A few people had to be helped back on to their chairs. No surrender,
Hammy.

SEDGEFIELD is the place to be for a profitable day's betting. Top of
the list is Adrien, who should not be opposed despite his welter burden
in the Quarrington Handicap Hurdle.
Sue Bramall's French import has taken a while to acclimatise and
showed precious little last season.
But that all changed on his reappearance at Carlisle last Saturday, as
Adrien strolled clear to beat His Way by 12 lengths.
A 7lb penalty should not stop Adrien making a quick follow-up against
three exposed rivals.
Up and coming amateur Richard Johnson is the jockey to follow as he
has prospects of a double courtesy of Iffeee and Mhemeanles.
Peter Bowen once again makes the marathon trip from South Wales with
Iffee but it should prove worthwhile in the Night Nurse Trophy Handicap
Chase .
It was Iffeee who gave him his first winner since taking out a full
licence when making all to beat Coup de Catherine by three-and-a-half
lengths over today's course and distance.
Iffee has a bit of scope and looks the obvious choice.
Mhemeanles shoulders top weight in the Stonegrave Aggregates Selling
Handicap Hurdle but is the best horse in the field on his day.
The five-year-old has been running consistently on the Flat and is a
shade better than a plater on the pick of his hurdling form.
It should be a good day for top weights as Val de Rama is the pick in
the Rowena Coleman Handicap Hurdle.
He would have won by a wide margin over course and distance last month
but for idling in front and having to be driven out to beat Souson
one-and-a-half lengths.
Val de Rama should surely have the measure of that rival once again on
the same weight terms.

THIS week's opening of a major retail park on the outskirts of
Edinburgh poses a challenge to Princes Street. While planners in the
West of Scotland generally insist that retail parks restrict their sales
to bulky goods such as furniture, carpets, and DIY materials,
Edinburgh's planners have granted ''open'' consents.
As a result, the 195,000 sq ft Hermiston Gait retail park at the
junction of the M8 extension and the Edinburgh city by-pass has
attracted many of the retailers who might normally be found only on
Scottish High Streets. The park is anchored by Homebase, the first of
Sainsbury's DIY stores in Scotland. The other tenants are: Curry's,
Halfords, Olympus, Harvey's Furnishings, Carpetrite, Children's World,
Byte Computers, Allied Carpets, and Shoe City.
Market rumour has it that the agents are close to signing a deal at
#22 per sq ft on a 15,000 sq ft unit which Cantors had pre-let but later
decided to hand back to the agents. Such a rental would be a new record
for Scotland where such rentals are usually around #10 per sq ft.
Hermiston Gait was developed by New Edinburgh Limited, a joint venture
between The Miller Group and Edinburgh Development &amp; Investment Ltd. The
park's estimated value is #42m, representing a yield of 5.75% which is
believed to be a record for a retail warehouse investment.
Joint letting agents are Grimley and Mason Owen. ''The success speaks
for itself,'' says Andy Carswell of Grimley. ''The West of the capital
is clearly one of the most dynamic commercial areas of the country and
that success is set to continue with the next phase of development.''
It is a similar story at Craigleith, another retail park under
development on the west side of Edinburgh, where rentals of #20 per sq
ft have been rumoured. This despite the fact that letting agents Peter
Campbell &amp; Co have not yet officially started marketing the scheme.
''Hermiston Gait and Craigleith are considered prime, so rents are
high,'' says Mike Simpson of Peter Campbell &amp; Co. ''But not every site
will come in at those sort of rates, it's certain that #20 won't be the
norm in Edinburgh and it would be potentially dangerous for people to
assume that #20 sets the tone for the East of Scotland. Many traditional
warehouse retailers would need much higher profits than they are
currently getting before they could consider #20 as normal.''
Apart from the high rentals which they are commanding, these new
schemes are remarkable for the high street retailers which they have
attracted. Many large retailers in the sports, toys and fashion sectors
are keen to hedge their bets by taking space on traditional city centre
pitches, like Edinburgh's Princes Street or Glasgow's Argyle Street,
while at the same time renting retail warehouses on the new out-of-town
retail parks like Hermiston Gait. One leading Edinburgh retail agent
says that Princes Street is already losing sales to The Gyle shopping
centre which was opened a couple of years ago and that the squeeze will
tighten.
''Hermiston Gait has attracted High Street retailers and Craigleith
will do the same,'' says Derek Gordon of agents Eric Young &amp; Co. ''These
schemes have been talked about for years, but they are now coming to
reality, and I'll eat my hat if Princes Street retailers don't feel the
impact.''

LAW and order and its relationship with race relations has been seen
for a considerable part of the post war period as a vote winner for the
Conservative Party. Indeed the general strategy of emphasising the
breakdown of social order was deemed to be a major contributor to Mrs
Thatcher's first election victory in 1979.
But is the race card worth playing for a political party? It is
certainly a high-risk strategy that plays on what divides people rather
than what unites them.
Perhaps the most significant intervention by a leading politician in
the post war period on the race issue was that of Enoch Powell back in
the late 1960s.
Yet surprisingly, given what has been written about that period, the
British Election Study at the 1970 General Election carried out by David
Butler and Donald Stokes found that there the issue of race had no net
effect on voting patterns.
It is only after the Thatcher victory in 1979 and the experience of
urban disturbance in the early 1980s that race becomes a net contributor
to Tory party fortunes at the 1983 and 1987 elections. There seems then
to be some evidence of race becoming a vote winner for the Conservatives
over the past 10 years.
However, this is not the complete picture. What is important to
remember in the effect of an issue is whether voters perceive a
significant difference between the political parties that might make a
difference. Here it has been consistently the case that a large minority
of voters (around one third) cannot distinguish between Conservative and
Labour positions on race and immigration.
There is also the question of who finds the race issue important.
Interestingly those voters with highest concern about race and
immigration come from social groups largely unaffected by immigrant
communities or race relation problems. These tend to be middle class,
suburban, or rural people. In fact, voters whose tendency is already to
vote Conservative anyway.
In those areas of the country where race is a visible issue, it
surprisingly impacts less on how people view the political parties.
It is also the case that there is no real evidence of a significant
growth in people's concerns about government strategies on racial
equality. The British Election Study in October 1974 showed that only
26% of people thought attempts to give equal rights to ethnic minorities
had gone too far. By 1979, this had risen slightly to 28%, but by 1983
it had dropped back to 18%. Over the last decade it has been relatively
stable at around 25%.
The experience of 20 years of government policy and high profile
race-related problems has not given any significant fuel to anti-racial
attitudes as a whole.
The impact of militancy is also interesting. In a 1985 Gallup survey,
17% of people said that people of a different race would make
undesirable neighbours. Yet, 31%, almost twice as many said that someone
with extreme right-wing views would make an undesirable neighbour.
Can Tory strategists be getting it right then, if race as an issue is
used as an electoral weapon? The answer to that is essentially that race
and immigration at the moment can only make a marginal difference to
Tory fortune. People are far more concerned about the economy,
unemployment, education, and the health service. Even if race is high on
someone's agenda, then the chances are they are already likely to vote
Tory.
But many Tory voters do appear to have deserted their party, at least
for now. Can the race card win them back? Again, this is debatable
because of the effect of other issues. Additionally it is crucially
important that if the race issue is to win back the disaffected then
Tory policy should be easily differentiated from Labour.
With Tony Blair's push to the centre ground of British politics, this
means that to differentiate themselves from Labour the Tories must
increasingly move to the right. This poses a dilemma. If the Tories move
too far to the right they risk alienating potential voters even further.
Extremism would do as an electoral strategy. It simply doesn't work in
Britain. Most people consider themselves to be moderate in attitudes and
in the centre. That is where the real battle for votes is, and it is a
battle Labour is winning.

AFTER the early week jitters, the Bank of England's auction of #3000m
of 8% 20-year Government stock was comfortably oversubscribed, boosting
gilt prices and prompting the Bank to praise the auction process,
suggesting it was working well and that the Government's funding
programme was on track.
That is perhaps overdoing it given the likely overshoot in the public
sector borrowing requirement, but there was undoubtedly some relief at
the auction's success after last month's disappointment, when the Bank
failed for the first time since 1989, after the Government resumed
borrowing, to sell all of its allocation at a gilts auction.
Yesterday's issue was covered 1.997 times against best market
expectations of 1.25 to 1.50 times. The lowest accepted price was
#96.25m for a yield of 8.33% with some 89.5% allotted at this price, and
the highest was #96.26 with bids above this level allotted in full. The
auction attracted bids amounting to #5991.7m.
Gilt prices had firmed in the morning ahead of the auction after the
rather gloomy CBI Industrial Trends Survey for October with its
implication that the next move in base rates would be down.
After the auction, they advanced further and in foreign exchange
markets the pound also initially firmed slightly against both the dollar
and the German mark although trading was thin and reaction was expected
to be short-lived. By the close sterling had slipped against the dollar.
The background to the auction this time round was more favourable then
on the previous occasion when 99% of the issue found a home. Three more
auctions of between #2000m and #3000m are scheduled before the end of
the current financial year.
But while the Treasury PSBR forecast is for #23.6bn, on the basis of
the figures so far actual City projections range from around #27bn to,
at worst, #30bn.
Analysts estimate that the Bank of England needs to sell around
another #11bn of gilts to meet the official forecast but would need to
raise #17bn to match the gloomiest projection.
So unless there is a surprise pick-up in revenue, an undershoot looks
in prospect unless the authorities try for an extra gilt auction or lift
the amounts on offer.
For the moment, though, the outcome of the gilt auction has cheered
markets and encouraged Government funding. It shows that if the market
considers the terms are right there is still a demand for gilts.

As opposition mounts to the Goverment's asylum plans, Benedict Brogan,
Political Reporter, looks at what the Tories hope to gain by cracking
down on immigration
NEXT month's Queen's Speech will include an Immigration and Asylum
Bill which, if as expected, Home Secretary Michael Howard has his way in
today's Cabinet meeting, will prove what the Tories know and the rest of
the country is reluctant to admit: there are votes to be had in
pandering to racism.
Two proposed measures, expected to form part of the Bill, have
provoked a storm of opposition. To clamp down on illegal immigrants Mr
Howard wants employers to take responsibility for ensuring their
employees are in the country legally. And to cut down on the thousands
of asylum seekers demanding refuge in the UK, Mr Howard proposes to draw
up a list of countries whose citizens would be barred from applying for
asylum.
Immigration, like patriotism, is the last refuge of the political
scoundrel. In a country as fundamentally small-c conservative as the UK,
encouraging fear of the dark hordes lurking across the Channel is a vote
winner.
No matter that the great waves of immigration are a thing of the past,
it is perceptions that matter, and Mr Howard judges that immigration is
perceived as a problem by a significant section of the electorate.
His theory is backed up by research carried out by pollsters MORI.
They estimate that only 3% of voters consider immigration to be an
important issue. But among those who voted Conservative in 1992 and who
are prepared to vote Labour next time, the figure rises to 5%. For the
Tories that small but significant section, one in every 20 voters, could
be crucial to their chances in a tight election.
MORI chairman Professor Robert Worcester argues that the Government
could benefit by playing up its claim that a Euro-friendly Labour Party
will open the floodgates for immigration from other EU countries.
''Those one in 20 of defecting Tories from 1992 who are susceptible on
immigration are only about 15% of the electorate. You're talking about
tiny numbers of people that matter on this issue,'' he says.
Armed with the knowledge that immigration can win him back some
support, Mr Howard proposes tough measures to tackle what the Tory right
claim is the growing problem of illegal immigrants taking jobs from
British citizens. But his plan to turn employers into policemen has
brought him into conflict with both business leaders and Cabinet
colleagues.
He had wanted to present the idea to delegates at Tory conference,
where he would have been assured of a suitably rapturous reception. But
he was pre-empted by Trade Secretary Ian Lang and Education Secretary
Gillian Shephard, who do not share Mr Howard's enthusiasm for right-wing
populism.
Mrs Shephard made public her fears that the measure would only foster
discrimination: rather than risk hiring an illegal alien, she argued,
employers would simply avoid hiring anyone who wasn't clearly British.
Mr Howard was forced to promise that the measure would be implemented
''with a light regulatory touch'', and it remains to be resolved by
Cabinet today.
To compound his troubles, Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director general of
the Institute of Directors, warned the measure would pile costs on small
businesses.
''Business should not be forced to adopt the role of policeman by
government abdicating its responsibility and imposing more burdens on
business.''
And Mr Adair Turner of the Confederation of British Industry called
for clear rules to distinguish between intentional and unintentional
hiring of illegal immigrants. ''The proposed legislation will do nothing
to improve equal opportunities and may undermine employers' commitment
to implement equal opportunity policy,'' he claims.
Yesterday the immigration debate was complicated further by
revelations of a Conservative Central Office briefing paper which
details Government proposals to limit the number of asylum seekers
applying for refuge in the UK, by producing a list of countries where
there is deemed to be no persecution and whose citizens would therefore
be automatically rejected, if they claimed asylum from political
oppression. These countries, the document states, ''would be unlikely to
produce genuine applicants''.
Although Mr Howard did not deny the plans, he was said to be furious
at the spin put on the document in the press, which described a ''white
list'' of countries, including Nigeria, Algeria, and Sri Lanka. The
Herald has learned that the document has in fact not been circulated to
MPs as reported, but only to Whitehall civil servants; that it makes no
mention of a ''white list''; and that it does not mention any specific
countries.
Instead, the countries the Government is said to be particularly
concerned about are those in Eastern Europe, notably Poland, whose
citizens are flocking west in search of the capitalist dream their
once-socialist homelands are finding it difficult to produce.
For Labour the issue is clear, at least in public: the Tories are
playing the race card in order, as its Home Affairs spokesman Mr Alun
Michael said yesterday, to satisfy the blood-lust of its supporters. But
if immigration is a vote winner, then it is an issue that must remain
closed to Labour.
Michael Howard, whose public extremism is, it is said, at odds with
his private views and his Jewishness, has made it his issue, and it is
by no means certain that he will carry all his colleagues with him.

Robert MacLeod reports on a company which has found that joining
assets is a constructive move.
ONE of the best-known and respected names in the building industry in
South-West Scotland has begun expanding its activities into the Central
Belt.
Robison and Davidson, which is based in Dumfries but already has a
strong presence in both Wigtownshire and Ayrshire, has marked the
advance by the acquirement by ''mutual agreement'' of the
long-established Glasgow joinery specialist firm John Cochrane and
Company Ltd.
Describing the move as ''strengthening our position and laying the
foundations for continued growth by joining with the long-established
and reputable business of John Cochrane and Co. Ltd,'' the Robison and
Davidson chairman, Bob Robison, said the expansion of the company and
the restructuring of the boardroom was already under way.
Bob Robison, Robison and Davidson managing director Jim Steen, and
recently appointed director Alex Steel, join three existing Cochrane
directors on the board of the new company. ''We are delighted to have
come to an amicable agreement on the future of our business with Robison
&amp; Davidson,'' said John Cochrane and Co. Ltd managing director, Ron
Tulloch.
The past few months has seen the company secure construction work
totalling around #4m in the Central Belt of Scotland. One of the first
new construction contracts under the enlarged Robison and Davidson
operation is the building of a supermarket at Wishaw. The company has an
annual turnover of #32m and a number of major contracts are due to be
announced in the near future.
The Robison and Davidson company also includes Robison Wood Products,
a company set up as a specialist branch in l966. It has established
offices at Annan Road, Dumfries, at Dunragit, near Stranraer, and at
Horwood Place, Mauchline, Ayrshire. Major completed projects include the
new Dumfries and Galloway Police Headquarters building, and other
projects have ranged from considerable work at the Turnberry Hotel in
Ayrshire to a banking hall at Ayr and windows and doors at Corberry
Mews, Dumfries.
Hand-crafted finishes in many areas have always been a feature with
the Dumfriesshire firm, a tradition it intends to continue.
A considerable force in the private housebuilding market since its
earliest days, the Robison involvement in that area also continues as it
takes its name and quality standards into new territory. The current
spread of build ranges in price from #50,000 to #140,000 with one-off
designs being constructed at up to #250,000. A range of timber house
kits for the parent company area is also built by Robison Wood Products.
Examples of Robison build, as seen at Blackley Park Estate, Dumfries,
begin with the two-bedroom Cairn detached bungalow with garage and go on
through the three bedroom semi-detached Garroch villa with optional
garage and porch, the Nithsdale three bedroom-detached villa with
integral garage, to the top of the range, the Dalveen four-bedroom
detached villa with integral garage.
The substantial list of recently completed contracts, now joined by
work completed by John Cochrane of Glasgow, illustrates the wide variety
of construction work undertaken and the spread of client base involved.
Scottish Homes contract completions include two valued at a total of
more than #3m for the modernisation of over l46 houses at Cumnock and
Sanquhar. Another #1.3m contract was completed for houses and a communal
unit at Prestwick for Kyle and Carrick District Council, and l36
modernisations were carried out at Stranraer for Wigtown District
Council for #1.2m.
Other major contracts listed by the company include the #1.6m
redevelopment building work at Galloway Creamery, the #3.3m building of
98 houses at Kilwinning for Irvine Development Corporation and the #1m
building of a temporary sheriff courthouse at Corbelly Hill, Dumfries.
They are joined by the #4.5m construction of l55 houses at Newbridge for
Dumfries North Housing Association and the design and build #1.8m
contract for a 92-bed nursing home for Westminster Health Care.
''We undertake a range of works from jobbing through private and
industrial to small civil works and pre-eminent contracts,'' said
chairman Bob Robison.
''We are particularly proud of the amount of repeat business we obtain
from established clients and for the reputation we have earned for
building to specification on time and within budget.''

THE power which Direct Line guru Peter Wood wields within Royal Bank
of Scotland was yesterday demonstrated by the news that he had been
given permission to set up his own US insurance venture.
At the same time, however, Mr Wood's service agreement was extended by
two years to January 1998. He cannot give notice of termination, set at
12 months, until this date, so the bank has effectively secured his
services until the beginning of 1999.
Mr Wood, who revolutionised the UK motor insurance market ten years
ago with Direct Line, will use his skills to establish a company which
will engage in the direct selling of motor and household insurance in
the US, Canada and Mexico.
Because Royal Bank owns Rhode Island-based Citizens Financial Group,
US legislation prevents it from engaging in substantial insurance
operations in the States.
Although the size of stake it will be allowed to take in Mr Wood's new
company will probably be a matter for discussion with the Federal
regulators, Royal Bank finance director Bob Speirs yesterday admitted it
could probably hold only a few per cent of the proposed US company.
Mr Wood is in preliminary discussions regarding the US venture with
Jim Stone, president of Massachusetts-based property casualty insurer
Plymouth Rock.
If Direct Line's branding is used, Royal Bank will receive payment.
The proposed US venture will probably take up a fair proportion of Mr
Wood's time.
However, Mr Speirs said: ''Peter is always, I know, completely devoted
to Direct Line. He always has been. He always will be.
''He now has a good management team and, if he can spend a little more
time doing other things he wants to do, then that is just natural
evolution.''
Referring to the deal reached with Mr Wood, Mr Speirs said: ''There
was no acrimony in these discussions whatsoever.''
Mr Wood is currently on holiday overseas.
In a statement released through Royal Bank, he said: ''Tackling the US
market is a major opportunity and I am delighted that Royal Bank shares
my enthusiasm for this project.''
Mr Wood, a main board director of Royal Bank with a #10m-plus
shareholding, added that he remained committed to Direct Line and the
bank.
George Mathewson, chief executive of Royal Bank, said the development
gave the bank an opportunity to participate in the US insurance market
to the extent currently possible, in a way which would bring it further
benefits from Mr Wood's proven track record in the industry.
Earlier this week, Mr Wood threatened to abandon Direct Line and set
up a rival telephone insurance business in the event of a hostile
takeover of Royal Bank.
The bank has been the subject of intense bid speculation in recent
weeks, although this has abated in the last couple of days.

THE acquisition of the Glasgow company John Cochrane Ltd by the
Dumfries-based builders Robison and Davidson brings together two
long-established and respected names in the Scottish construction
industry. It is a very appropriate acquision, carried out by mutual
agreement, both firms having a considerable reputation for the quality
and reliability of their work over many years.
The Robison name has been synonymous with building in Dumfriesshire
for a full six generations. That part of the story began with a Robison
-- the present managing director's uncle -- first setting up as a
jobbing builder in l922. Ten years later he was joined by a local
architect named Davidson and the partnership was set up as a limited
company.
Later the architect ceased his involvement but the firm continued to
grow in strength. It entered the housebuilding market and subsidiary
companies were set up in joinery and pre-cast concrete work. By l979 it
had become a subsidiary of the Lilley group, but in l993 a management
buy-out backed by banks and institutions returned Robison and Davidson
to private control.
Three members of the Robison family, spanning generations, are on the
company board. Backing the continuing policy of always producing work
which combines skill with quality, all of the firm's 650 employees are
encouraged to take part in training programmes. The Dumfriesshire firm
is a major supporter of the building trades' apprenticeship schemes.
With financial strength as a company watchword at all times, the
tradition for quality which began with the work produced by that small,
founding jobbing builder's business has been underlined by its receipt
of both Saltire and Civic Trust awards and by an impressive table of
repeat business from established clients.
John Cochrane and Company Ltd, based at Craighall Road, Glasgow, has a
craftsmanship history which goes back to l856. The present workforce of
eighty have continued a tradition of high-quality joinery work, adding
the benefits of modern technology. It recently completed work on the
Hospitality Inn in Glasgow and is currently involved in refurbishment in
the Gallery of Modern Art at the same time as the #1.3m fitting out of
the Standard Life building in Edinburgh.
The Glasgow firm has long had a particular reputation for quality
joinery work on public buildings from courtrooms to hospitals. Other
client areas range from banking offices to hotels and laboratories,
universities and both regional and local authorities.
Diversity ranges from John Cochrane being one of the few remaining
companies with the skills and knowledge to be able to manufacture timber
handrailing to its ability to offer complete packages in new-build
projects from builder work through to decoration.
Both businesses went into the acquisition agreement with strong order
books.
''We are delighted to have come to an amicable agreement on the future
of our business,'' said Ron Tulloch, managing director of the Glasgow
company.
''This is an opportunity for both businesses involved to grow and
develop.''

THE Scottish economy will be seriously damaged unless the country's
key electronics industry picks up again soon, an economic report
published today warns.
Property consultant and chartered surveyor Ryden's bi-annual Scottish
Industrial and Commercial Property Review points out that, although 5.1%
growth in Scottish manufacturing output last year outstripped the UK as
a whole, it was almost entirely the result of a booming electronics
sector.
However, the electronics sector, which enjoyed a 26% rise in output
during 1994, stopped growing at the end of last year, according to the
Scottish Office's quarterly Index of Production and Construction.
Without the positive impact of the electronics industry, Ryden's
review says Scotland's manufacturing output would be 10% below its 1990
level, instead of 10% above.
In spite of this, Edinburgh-based Ryden forecasts that the slowdown in
the electronics industry will prove to be a temporary setback and
believes Scotland's economy will continue to be resilient.
Its review states: ''There is an immediate concern about the pause in
the growth of Scottish electronics output. If this proves to be lengthy,
it will be a serious blow to the narrowly-based Scottish economy.''
However, it adds: ''The likelihood is that it (the pause) will be
transitory, as the hallmark of the Scottish economy in the 1990s has
been the persistence of stable economic growth, often to the surprise of
its detractors.''
Ryden considers export evidence from recent surveys ''very positive''
and believes the benefits of recent high-value inward investment,
principally in export-orientated industries, is yet to be seen.
The review concludes that the medium-term prospects for the Scottish
economy depend crucially on maintaining export momentum, capturing
contracts from the revival of oil exploration and development, and
selling Scotland's cities as service centres.
However, Ryden warns that the UK could be on the brink of a new
recession.
It adds that, even with tax cuts of #5000m in next month's Budget, it
is difficult to be optimistic about growth in consumer spending.
Meanwhile, Ryden believes banks may have to relax their stance towards
property further if the property investment market is to flourish.
It claims there is little or no finance for speculative developments,
such as those proposed by companies keen to re-enter a market in Glasgow
which is experiencing diminishing supply in the office sector.
There was a major slowdown in activity in the Edinburgh office sector
during the summer.
Take-up in the six months to September was 280,826sq ft, down from
443,153 sq ft in the abnormally-active previous six months.

THEY came for the two cousins in the middle of the night and left
their badly mutilated bodies in the street the following day. Then there
was the wife and children of a retired policeman who were stabbed to
death in broad daylight; and the professor, missing for three months
before his body surfaced in a city morgue.
This was Algeria last year, but it might well have been Nigeria or
even Sri Lanka, because human rights activists say all three are
similarly well-versed in the bloody logistics of human rights abuses.
There was a sense of disbelief amongst the activist community
yesterday at reports that the three countries were on an alleged ''white
list'' of nations apparently deemed safe enough by the British
Government to close the door on those trying to flee from them.
''They are all of them countries where there are gross violations of
human rights,'' said Jan Shaw, refugee officer with Amnesty
International in London. ''Everybody is staggered . . . if you look at
where people are coming from, Nigeria is top of the league, Sri Lanka
has aways been among the top group and Algeria is climbing up to the
top. I think that is probably where this is coming from.''
Last year there were 4340 applications for asylum from Nigeria. Sri
Lanka came second with 2350, and Algeria tenth with 995. Home Office
figures show that one or, at most, two of the Nigerians were given
refugee status, compared to 10 of the Sri Lankans, and 20 of the
Algerians.
Amnesty is in the process of producing a new report on Nigeria and
allegedly secret trials. The country, Africa's most populous nation, has
a chequered history of political instability and is currently under the
control of a transitional military regime. ''Our understanding is that
the situation there is worse that it has been for the last 34 years,''
said Jan Shaw.
In its latest study, Amnesty concluded that hundreds of pro-democracy
activists had been arrested during 1994, many of them were prisoners of
conscience and still in jail at the year's end.
The organisation says at least 50 people were reportedly
extra-judicially executed by the security forces in the region of
Ogoniland where there has been a campaign against environmental damage
by oil companies.
In Sri Lanka, recent atrocities against the civilian population have
heightened concerns amongst aid workers and human rights activists.
Despite efforts by the Sinhalese Government to address human rights
abuses, campaigners say the country continues to be traumatised by the
conflict between the Goverment and the Tamil Tigers.
''There certainly is a continuing concern about the security of
civilians in connection with the civil war in Sri Lanka,'' said Jeannine
Guthrie, Asian specialist for the organisation Human Rights Watch in
Washington, DC.
''There has been a great deal of displacement and some civilian
casualties. There are reports of more targeted attacks on civilians by
both parties. The situation is far from stable and there continue to be
grave human rights concerns. I wouldn't consider it stable enough at
this point to consider repatriation. I think that would be quite
dangerous . . . the situation can change wildly from month to month.''
Amnesty International has estimated that the civil war between the
military Government and Muslim militants in Algeria has cost 40,000
people their lives over the past three years. The country has been
unstable since the 1992 elections were won by the Islamic Salvation
Front and the result was then cancelled.
Amnesty says that the case of 16-year-old Algerian Katia Bengana, is
typical of the type of terror Algerians are facing. Katia had refused to
wear the traditional hijab or veil and was shot dead in front of a
friend as she walked home from school.
Amnesty and the other human rights organisations said refugees had the
right to have their asylum claims judged on individual merits and that
the blanket policy of the ''white list'' would violate this right.
Approaches will now be made to the Government to clarify its plans for
the new Asylum and Immigration Bill.

DIVERSIFICATION into medical systems and industrial products has paid
off handsomely for Smiths Industries.
Both sectors have shown an identical 34% rise in profitability in the
past year while the more traditional aerospace activities have been
bumping along at around #40m for quite some time.
Overall group pre-tax profits advanced 17% to #138m on a similar
increase in turnover to #899m.
The aerospace business is set to benefit from new orders for flight
management computers for the new Boeing 737 short-haul aircraft which is
worth about #225m over the next 15 years. Smiths also has orders for
in-flight systems for the Apache helicopter and the F18 fighter that
will augment deliveries taking place for the Boeing 777.
There are signs that the aviation business will benefit from several
defence contracts over the next year although it may take a little
longer for any improvement in commercial activities. The group will have
maintain its rationalisation to keep margins on turnover little changed
at #374m.
The medical side benefited from past acquisitions and from the
introduction of new and upgraded products, particularly in the US.
America accounts for about half of the group's turnover.
Margins were almost held steady at 23% compared with the group average
up 1% to 16%.
In the past three years, about #134m has been spent on acquisitions in
the industrial division which include general engineering, Flex-Tek and
Vent-Axia -- a decided beneficiary from the hot summer in the UK.
There was 10% organic growth, productivity gains as well as a slight
improvement in trading conditions.
Chairman Roger Hurn yesterday said there was strong cash flow last
year. It rose by #11m to #140m which, despite acquisitions totalling
#52m and self-financed research and development of #49m, resulted in the
elimination of #20m of borrowings.
The shares rose 15p to 580p where they trade at 16[1/2] times likely
earnings. The dividend total has been raised 11% to 14.4p with a 9.35p
final for a 3.1% yield.

SCOTTISH Television plans to launch a Scottish cable TV channel next
year and inject local programming into the Mirror Group's Live TV
channel in Glasgow.
The proposed 'Scottish Channel' will show three hours a day of
Scottish Television repeats, local news that people would normally be
read in a weekly newspaper rather than see on television, programmes
sponsored by Scottish companies and local authorities and lengthy live
coverage of current events in Scotland.
Live broadcasts on the Scottish Channel could range from full coverage
of the annual T-in-the-Park rock festival to debates in a future
Scottish parliament.
Scottish's input for Live TV subscribers in Glasgow will probably
consist of local news bulletins, reviews of local entertainments,
teletext pages, and up to an hour a day of other programming.
Chief executive Gus Macdonald announced the cable initiatives
yesterday in a speech to the European Cable Communications conference in
London.
He said Scottish Television would set up the Scottish Channel in
conjunction with its strategic partner Flextech, a UK subsidiary of the
US cable television giant Telecommunications International (TCI).
Flextech bought a 20% stake in Scottish last month in a deal that was
tailor-made to give the Glasgow-based television station new outlets in
cable and satellite broadcasting.
Mr Macdonald said he was also talking to Mirror Group, which owns 20%
of Scottish Television, about producing local programming for Live TV in
Glasgow.
He gave few details about the planned cable ventures, which are still
in the early stages of planning, but said the proposed Scottish Channel
would be ''100% made in Scotland''.
He also stressed that this cable venture would allow Scottish to tap
new sources of revenue as advertising income from its ITV franchise
stagnates due to competition from cable and satellite broadcasters.
''We can unlock millions of pounds of production investment from
advertiser supported programming, from sponsors and from marketing
budgets from a wide range of organisations,'' Mr Macdonald said.
In addition to Scottish Television's own output, the Scottish Channel
would carry ''quality programming about every aspect of life in
Scotland'' from other sources, he said.
The Scottish Channel is being launched in conjunction with Telewest, a
Flextech associate which has cable franchises covering 625,000 homes in
the central belt of Scotland.
TCI owns 49% of Flextech, which produces programmes for cable and
satellite broadcasters, and 38% of Telewest, which has the largest cable
TV network in the UK.
A spokeswoman for Telewest in Scotland said the company had held
''informal discussions'' with Scottish Television about launching the
Scottish Channel for several months.
''We are very interested to see the project pursued and developed and
will bring to bear all the resources we can to that end,'' she added.
Although Telewest controls cable franchises in Edinburgh, Dundee,
Perth, Glenrothes, Falkirk, Motherwell, Cumbernauld, and Dumbarton, the
key franchise for 550,000 homes in Glasgow belongs to its rival
Cabletel.
Cabletel has so far been left out of the Scottish Channel project, but
Scottish will eventually have to come to terms with it, in order to
distribute its local programming for Live TV in Glasgow.
Live TV began broadcasting in June and will launch its first ''Local
Live'' stations in Westminster and Birmingham later this year. These
will opt out of the national network at several points during the day to
screen local programmes and advertising.
Richard Hall, the assistant managing director of Mirror Television,
said he hoped the Glasgow Local Live project would go ahead in 1996.
But the exact form it will take depends on the degree of involvement
of the the Daily Record, the Mirror Group's flagship newspaper in
Scotland.
Mr Hall said Mirror Group wanted the Daily Record to be closely
involved in news gathering for the Local Live in Glasgow and in
organising advertising.
But David Whitton, the head of public affairs at Scottish Television,
said the project would become more complicated if the Scottish newsroom
had to start co-ordinating its activities with those of the newspaper.
Neither the Scottish Channel nor the Live TV project have been fully
costed yet.
But Bill McCall, a broker with Tilney in Edinburgh, said nothing but
good could come STV's diversification away from terrestrial television,
which faces a long-term decline in advertising revenue, into new media.
''I think this is a very major and significant announcement as far as
Scottish Television is concerned,'' he said.
Scottish shares closed unchanged at 499p.

A CRACKING trade for Simmental bulls was the feature of the third day
of the Perth Bull Sales yesterday, when the Simmentals were sold, writes
DAN BUGLASS.
The top price was 12,000gns for a first prize winner, the April 1994
Bemersyde Emperor from Charles Bruce, Bemersyde, Melrose. The buyers
were George Anderson, Kair, Fordoun, Kincardineshire, and Strathisla
Farms, Meigle, Perth. Mr Bruce also went on to sell another of the same
age, Bemersyde Eros, for 8000gns to Mr and Mrs D Mills, Wishful Farm,
Wellington, Somerset.
The next best at 7500gns was the March 1994 Cleenagh Enormous from
Adrian Richardson, Hillview, Macguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, which
sold to J Hare, Stranraer.
At 6500gns Charles Bruce was back at the top end of the trade selling
the April 1994 Bemersyde Endeavour to Mr and Mrs A Hurn, Beck Farm,
Norwich.
At the show of the Charolais, judge George Stoddart from Cumbria found
his supreme champion in the intermediate winner Stirling Jonquille from
Andrew and John Hornall, Falleninch, Stirling.
The reserve was the senior champion from Cyril Millar, Glenleary,
Coleraine, Northern Ireland.
* SCOTTISH NFU vice-president Stewart Whiteford, who farms at Nigg in
Easter Ross, has indicated that he will be a candidate for the
presidency when the current holder, John Ross, stands down at the
union's annual meeting in Ayr next March.

RACHED Barkou and Khaled Mohammed promised to write with news of their
safe return to Algeria. Nothing has been heard since May, when the two
were deported.
Held in Greenock Prison as illegal immigrants, they went on hunger
strike, saying they would rather die than be returned to the regime they
had fled, but their action, sufficiently desperate for them to be
transferred to the medical wing at Barlinnie, failed to convince the
Home Office.
No news is bad news for their fellow-countryman ''Mohammed'', who
fears the worst. He remains in Greenock, where he has been held since
last December and is now awaiting a date for a judicial review of his
case after being refused asylum and appealing unsuccessfully against
that decision.
In his mid-30s, he was a civil servant whose criticism of the regime
made it unsafe for him to remain. He knew someone in Glasgow, and
arrived here by boat and with sufficient resources to pay for rent
accommodation in the city without claiming social security.
After a few months, he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and taken
to the remand wing at Greenock prison.
There are currently 16 men (from Algeria, China, India, Iran, and
Pakistan) detained there on behalf of the Home Office, plus a few in
Aberdeen prison. The immigration service has no detention centre in
Scotland.
According to Mr Derek Goh, the criminal justice officer for
Strathclyde Community Relations Council, the prison staff make a
determined effort to obtain foreign language newspapers and videos for
asylum-seekers, but many of them become extremely depressed and some
suicidal.
The Scottish Refgee Council is currently working with 15 Algerians
seeking asylum among the growing Algerian community here.
There are also small numbers of Sri Lankan and Nigerian asylum-seekers
in Scotland. The impossibility of applying any blanket ban fairly is
illustrated by one case which ''may have some merit'' according to the
official observation made by the immigration officer conducting the
interview with a Nigerian seeking asylum.
Eghofa Ohimumwen has a high political profile in his own country,
where he was involved in the Presidential elections in 1993, with the
hope of becoming a state commissioner for social development. His
problems began when the election was annulled and the military took
over. He was imprisoned -- and tortured -- for orchestrating political
protest and eventually his family bribed guards to get him out.
The UK interviewing officer recorded that he was ''politically aware,
knowledgeable and plausible''. He was granted temporary admission in
October last year, and has been living in Scotland, but has not been
granted refugee status, which means he lives in fear of being sent back
to certain persecution.
The difficulties of temporary status are also experienced by many
asylum-seekers from the former Yugoslavia. Among them is Gordana Vasic,
a teacher of Serbo-Croat, who came to Glasgow where she had spent a
happy year as an au pair when she found it impossible to teach the
language she loves in politically correct Serbian and Croatian chunks.
Now joined by her sister and two friends in Glasgow, she is
desperately seeking work which would use her linguistic and librarian
skills, but even the possibilities of translation are hampered by the
fact that, though from Bosnia, she is a Serb while most refugees and
those seeking medical treatment are Bosnians.
''There is nothing for us to return to. My parents have lost their
family home because they are the wrong ethnic group. I would not get a
job and I have nowhere to go,'' she said.

A FRESH approach to the support of farmers in the hills and uplands
was called for at an open forum at Coventry yesterday.
The key to this initiative would be a one-stop financial package which
would combine elements of both production support and environmental care
payments.
The current forms of support, based on headage payments for livestock,
are seen as counter-productive as they provide encouragement for
over-stocking and over-grazing as well as favouring larger units at the
expense of the small family farm.
Support for the new Hill Farming Initiative, the group staging the
forum, came from diverse bodies such as the Tenant Farmers Association,
the Soil Association, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group.
''The logic of combining the present support schemes in a package
designed specifically for the uplands is inescapable,'' said John
Rennie, director general of the TFA. ''The scheme must ensure that the
income per family is high enough to ensure the survival of hill and
upland farming.''
A blueprint for the new system has been drawn up by a group of
consultants, based on upland farming on the Yorkshire Dales. After some
fine tuning it is proposed to find sponsorship to put it into practice
for a year on the Low Oxque Farm on Swalevale tenanted by HFI spokesman
Alistair Davy. It will act as a model.
''This has been a particularly hard year for hill and upland farmers
but what we are really worried about is the long-term policy and this is
why we have set out this new blueprint,'' said Mr Davy.
''We want to demonstrate that we no longer have the financial returns
to keep up the general maintenance of the countryside. Because we are
having to tighten our belts, walls, barns and other buildings are
falling into disrepair.''
Tourism relied heavily on the quality of the countryside and brought
in #5000m for the country while hill livestock payments only cost #105m
he said.
''There are a multiplicity of schemes that don't add up to very much
financially, particularly as they demand the farmer puts up some capital
as well and we don't have that. The schemes are also extremely difficult
with extraordinary regulations attached. What we need is for all these
schemes to be brought into one.''
Richard Knight, national technical director with the Farming and
Wildlife Advisory Group, said headage payments provided the wrong answer
for hill and upland farmers. He advocated a floating grant principle
based on a tendering system and linked to what each individual farm
could achieve in terms of environmental improvement as well as
production.
Dr Julia Wrathall of the RSPCA said the current support system would
encourage farmers with falling incomes to react by intensifying
production leading to environmental damage and possible nutritional harm
to livestock.

SCOTLAND'S largest laundry company is to create 100 new jobs in Perth,
it was announced yesterday.
Fishers Services is to invest #2m in a new state-of-the-art laundry on
the city's Inveralmond Industrial Estate. The laundry is expected to
provide 100 new jobs in its first two years of operation with the
possibility of more to follow.
The company, which currently employs over 500 people at its operations
in Aberfeldy, Cupar and Greenock, provides bed and table linen to hotels
and restaturants throughout Scotland.
The company is to receive grant assistance from Perth and Kinross
District Council towards the construction.

SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs company, yesterday
reported third-
quarter results in line with City expectations showing a 9% rise in
pre-tax profit to #310m.
The group's performance was affected by interest charges resulting
from increased debt and taxes related to acquisitions and higher capital
expenditure.
At comparable rates of exchange, sales from continuing operations
jumped 16% to #1717m. Earnings per share rose 1% to 7.9p. There is an
interim third-quarter dividend of 3.2p per ''A'' share.
On a divisional basis, pharmaceutical sales grew by 10% and profit by
12%. Sales volumes increased 9% but this was offset to some degree by a
2% decline in price.
Newer drugs continued to show good growth, more than offsetting the
expected decline in prescription Tagamet sales in the US. They account
for almost a third of the group's drug sales. Kyril, an anti-emetic for
cancer patients, reported sales up 40%, helped by the wider availability
of the oral formulation.
Tagamet HB, an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for heartburn was
successfully launched in the US. Other new products include vaccines in
Europe. Sales of Havrix, the world's first Hepatitis A vaccine, jumped
64%.
During the quarter, UK approval was received for Famvir, a drug to
treat shingles and Seroxat, a treatment for obsessive compulsive
disorder. The flow of new products is expected to continue with
contributions from SmithKline's own pipeline and through collaborations
with other companies.
New product sales rose by 26%. Savings from the integration of the
medicines business of Sterling, acquired in 1994, helped to boost group
operating margins.
The consumer healthcare division reported a 51% sales increase and 73%
profits rise reflecting the contribution from the addition of Sterling
Winthrop. SmithKline is the world's leading OTC company. Sales of
nutritional healthcare products increased 10%, worldwide sales of
Horlicks rose 26% with especially strong growth in India. In a difficult
market Clinical Laboratories' sales inched up 1% but profits fell 27% to
#6m.
Having been on the acquisition trail twice already SmithKline feels no
need to make any further purchases.
''We can do something if it makes strategic sense, but we are not
going to do anything just to boost earnings over the next two years,''
said chief executive Jan Leschly. SmithKline has a stated aim of
becoming a fully integrated healthcare giant and some City analysts
believe this may lead the company to acquire a prescription medicines
group at some time in the future.
SmithKline Beecham shares rose 9p to 673p.

THE chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council, Ms Kaliani Lyle,
last night said she was appalled that the ''white list'' of nations
might have been drawn up.
Ms Lyle said the consequences of the list would be grave for asylum
seekers and the move was a blow to people seeking refuge in the UK.
The Scottish Refugee Council, which has offices in both Edinburgh and
Glasgow, has dealt with 400 people in the past year. Of those 23 come
from Algeria, three from Nigeria, and one from Sri Lanka, the countries
at the centre of the proposed ban.
Amongst the Algerians, two people went on hunger strike in prison to
protest against the whole asylum system and the fear about being sent
back.
Ms Lyle said: ''Around 60% of people who seek asylum in Scotland have
a degree and are well qualified and educated.
''To suggest that such people who are looking for asylum here are
bogus is an attack on all asylum seekers.
''Benefit levels in this country have been cut so much that, if the
Government plans are accepted, asylum seekers face the stark choice of
either being sent home to face prosecution or starving here in the
United Kingdom.''
Ms Lyle said there was a ''culture of disbelieve'' in the Home Office
that was misplaced regarding the reasons for people seeking asylum.

WHEN I hear the word culture, I reach for my gun. So said Herman
Goering, second in line to Adolf Hitler in the leadership of the
National Socialist Party of Germany, more widely known as the Nazis.
To the Nazis culture was about velvet jacketed effeminate poets,
wimpish novelists, and philosophers who sought to enlighten the masses
with complicated definitions of the truth. They fed the masses easy to
absorb certitudes about supermen, the master race, the destiny of blood,
and other such crap.
Throughout the Western World the word culture has been truncated to
mean laudable things like the Edinburgh Festival, Opera, Ballet,
Symphonic music, ''Serious'' Theatre, ''Serious'' Literature, Poetry,
and the Visual Arts -- which is also nonsense.
This word is correctly used by anthropologists who talk of culture as
meaning the totality of a society and its workings, including its
economy, modes of production, commerce, jurisprudence, religions,
philosophies, and its arts.
The origins of art are well documented. Music and poetry in primitive
societies were linked with work. Hunters and the chase. Among pastoral
peoples the habits of domesticated animals. Labour which involved groups
led to rhythmic dance and chants.
The earliest dramatic performances involved acts essential to the
struggle for an existence beyond subsistence. Animals played a key role
so we have murals in caves of the animals man hunted or husbanded, and
sometimes of animals that hunted man. Actors used animal masks in what
were essentially animal pantomimes.
This was the origin of ancient Greek drama. The goat was a fundamental
element in the economic life of ancient Greece. The Greek word for goat
is tragos from which is derived the word tragedy.
This is a marvellous thought and pierces the mustiness of academic
pedants. Theatrical tragedies started with the goat.
Art reflects the wider culture of human society. It is rooted in the
life of real people. If this is so then there can be no legitimacy in
art for art's sake. Art is for the sake of humanity and there is no
nobler calling.
Any human capable of surpassing excellence, in any field of endeavour,
is an artist. Pele, Di Stefano, Puskas, Cruyff and what they could do
with a piece of inflated leather, was, in its own way, as artistic as
what Yehudi Menuhin could do with a piece of wood and some animal gut.
Over the years, football, at its very best, has developed into an art
form. Unfortunately, Scottish football has missed out on this
development. We are a light year, or two, behind.
Hence the lamentations when Glasgow Rangers got trounced by Juventus.
The shock evinced by some commentators was hard to understand. Rangers
had no chance before the game, and had no chance during the game.
Our football authorities are trying to eliminate the skill deficit in
our game, and good luck to them, but there is a deeper problem that is
not being tackled and maybe it's something beyond their compass. There
is a sub-culture in Scottish football, it's probably been around for
years, which is dragging the game down into a gutter from which no good
can come.
It is composed of foul mouthed men whose lingua Franca is an
uninterrupted flow of effing and ceeing, with frequent references to
male and female genitalia. Macho braggarts who believe they are the
working class lifeblood of the game.
They are not working class but lumpen proletarians, that tiny section
of the working class that has become brutalised and desensitised. They
smoulder with a mindless aggression that erupts before, during, and
after games.
Let the BBC or Commericial Television in Scotland do what I've been
advocating for years. Get a camera with a couple of sound men in the
crowd and let us see in close-ups the faces distorted with hate, and
hear language that for sheer bestiality defies description.
These people are not really interested in good football. Crude ersatz
excitement is their goal. They want end to end football and don't give a
damn how the ball gets from one end to the other. A big blooter will
suffice and then plenty of scrimmaging and jostling in the penalty box.
If a Scottish team tries to play studied football, they are hissed.
I'VE heard Scottish managers shouting at their players, after a game,
in a stream of personally abusive four letter words. If a gaffer had
spoken to any worker in a factory or yard in this way, the punters would
have walked out, and yet it's acceptable in Scottish football. I asked
one manager why they did this and he told me: ''It's the only language
they understand.'' If his is true what does that say of our players, and
their intelligence?
Let's get one thing clear. I swear and everyone I know swears but
there is a quantum difference between how the ordinary bloke swears, and
these lumpen types. I get excited by good football and get really
excited when a Scottish team is doing it, nowadays a rather infrequent
experience, but unalloyed joy is qualitatively different from the
obscene triumphalism so manifest in the lumpens.
On Tuesday evening I went with some friends for a meal prior to the
game between Rangers and Aberdeen. In one part of the pub Aberdeen
supporters were giving Gazza hawmaw in the cruellest of fashions. In
another part Rangers supporters were giving Roman Catholics hawmaw with
what is euphemistically called ''party songs''.
What I'm saying is that imparting skills and hopefully the art of
football to our youngsters is of no use if they are to practice their
skills in an atmosphere dominated by lumpen louts. We need to attract
back to the game good working class guys, their families, and THEIR
culture. The lumpens should be chased away by the clubs, the police, and
good fans. They tarnish everything they touch, even the beautiful game.

SUPERMARKET group Asda has been ordered by the High Court in England

produced by healthcare firms Sanatogen and Seven Seas.
The court ruling clarifies an injunction against Asda on Tuesday which
covered only eight products made by Sanatogen, which is owned by Roche
and Seven Seas, which is part of Hanson.
Last week, Asda cut prices on some over-the-counter vitamins, minerals
and supplements by up to 20%, challenging a 25-year-old price-fixing
pact for OTC medicines. This pact is the last remaining one following
the recent collapse of the Net Book Agreement.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>21</PAGE>
<FLAG>BUSINESS COMMENT</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>975700208</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
REPORTS of the demise of British Gas are premature, consumers will be
glad to know. There was something of a scare yesterday following
comments from the gas regulator Clare Spottiswoode that the group's
long-term viability could be in doubt as a result of its crippling
long-term contracts to buy large volumes of gas from producers.
The shares, already under pressure, lost 11p, cutting #470m from the
capitalisation. Yet there was nothing new in what Ms Spottiswoode had to
say and analysts are already well aware of the problem.
Some of the long-term contracts date back to before British Gas was
privatised and all were signed before the Government decided to bring
forward the opening up of the domestic market to full competition to
1998.
The contracts oblige the group to pay for gas at fixed prices even if
it is unable to sell it on to consumers. With commercial and industrial
markets open to competition and the domestic market looming, gas prices
have almost halved over the past year or so as other companies have
moved into the market.
British Gas has paid out #500m in the first half of the year on the
contracts and expects to make a #50m-#100m provision for the full year
to cover losses. The eventual liability is anyone's guess but will not
threaten the viability of a group capitalised at #11bn.
It may be reduced by renegotiation of some of the contracts and by a
recovery in gas prices, particularly once an inter-connector is in place
between the UK and Belgium in 1998.
Ms Spottiswoode was no doubt putting a pessimistic spin on the
situation to help British Gas renegotiate contracts. In theory the
producers can hold the group strictly to the contracts but it would be
politically unwise to do so.
While the Government maintains that it is nothing to do with the
problem, it would not want British Gas with its army of small
shareholders to suffer unduly and it controls who gets offshore
exploration licences.
Daunting task
WHATEVER the Government's financing difficulties which could, and
almost certainly do, still lie ahead, yesterday's successful outcome of
the #3000m gilt auction undoubtedly came as a relief.
Another debacle like the one that happened last month when the issue
was uncovered, if only marginally, could have had serious repercussions
for the gilts market.
Any serious decline in gilt prices would have meant the Government had
to pay much more for its funds if it was to attract investors and that
would have implications for interest rates.
However, it was clear in the morning that there had been a good
response, though in the event this proved to be even better than the
market was anticipating.
Nervousness in the days ahead of the auction was understandable and
was reflected in financial markets. But any relief from this is likely
to be brief in the run-up to the Budget.
The PSBR looks set to overshoot the official target, on the gloomiest
projection by as much as #7000m. This, allied to the continuing debate
as to whether Chancellor Kenneth Clarke will go for cuts in personal
taxes in his Budget, something that would be perceived as overtly
political in the present climate, does not make for quiet markets and
these are likely to become more volatile nearer Budget day.
Even if the Chancellor was to make balancing cuts in public
expenditure, as employers' bodies insist he must do if personal taxes
are reduced, the scope must be extremely limited. This year's Budget
submissions had a common theme -- he should forget about cutting income
tax and concentrate on helping small businesses.
What with the PSBR running above forecasts and financial markets
prepared to judge the Budget on its prudence, his task is not an
enviable one if he is also looking to restore the feel good-factor at a
stroke.
Free rein
THE takeover speculation and frenzy surrounding the Royal Bank of
Scotland has thankfully cooled with the shares losing unchanged last
night at 517p and well down on the heady 570p seen last week.
The City has been somewhat puzzled by the ambitions of Direct Line
founder Peter Wood who has effectively been given free rein to do as he
will in the US with the Royal having a minimal stake in whatever
emerges.
Fortunately, US banking laws will prevent Direct Line which is the
Royal's unique selling point in terms of market rating becoming involved
with the proposed new venture with Plymouth Rock. Fortunate because the
Royal has had an unqualified success already in the US with its Citizens
Financial Group retail banking operation in New England thanks in part
to the inspired decision to put Larry Fish in charge and it may be open
to doubt as to whether the Direct Line type formula may be guaranteed
success in the US.
However, Royal's chief executive, George Mathewson, did have a problem
on his hands in controlling the huge energy and aspirations of Mr Wood
and so letting him loose elsewhere and at little risk to the bank is an
attractive solution particularly as he also remains tethered for the
next three years to Direct Line.

SCOTTISH giftware companies had secured a record #12m-plus of orders
by the time the 25th Highland Trade Fair in Aviemore closed its doors
last night, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Moreover, Made in Scotland, the national crafts marketing agency,
scotched rumours that it will move the four-day fair out of the
Highlands when it is privatised next year.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and Scottish Enterprise
together hold the majority of shares in Made in Scotland. HIE has
therefore, until now, been able to insist the event is held within its
area.
It was this week's confirmation that HIE and Scottish Enterprise were
to divest their holdings which sparked rumours of a switch of venue to
the Lowlands.
However, Made in Scotland managing director Kathleen Hardie said:
''We're back in Aviemore next year.
''The event's a great success story there so, if it ain't broke, why
fix it? Our future is in the Highlands.''
A spokesman for Made in Scotland, which is based at Beauly, west of
Inverness, said no decision had been taken about how Scottish Enterprise
and HIE would divest their stakes but believed the privatisation process
would involve giftware producers.
Made in Scotland, whose Government subsidy was reduced during the last
five years, now only receives public funds for specific trade missions.
About 4600 buyers from 25 countries pushed spending past last year's
#10.8m.
A 50-strong buying party from South-east Asia spent heavily. Japanese
department stores joined US counterparts Macy's and Bloomingdale's at
the Aviemore fair.
Companies from Shetland to the Borders, producing everything from
jewellery and ceramics to tweeds and silks, occupied 780 stands. The
fair brought 8000 people to Aviemore.
The industry is focusing more on quality and design and has
successfully penetrated less price-sensitive markets as a result.

MORNING Noon &amp; Night, which has opened 25 convenience stores across
Scotland since starting from scratch only four years ago, is enjoying
strong sales growth and expects final pre-tax profits to be more than
50% ahead of last year's #180,000, writes IAN McCONNELL.
During its first half to September 22, the Dundee-based chain's gross
retail sales were up 32% on the corresponding period of its previous
financial year at #9.07m.
Stripping out the impact of the rapidly-expanding private company's
four most recent acquisitions, like-for-like sales were up 13%. This is
well ahead of current inflation in convenience food retailing of 3%.
The long hot summer boosted Morning Noon &amp; Night's sales of soft
drinks, cold meats and beer. Sales of alcoholic drinks also benefited
from the change in Sunday licensing laws which came into effect on
December 4.
Morning Noon &amp; Night, which now employs 380 people, continues to
benefit from the great British public's obsession with the National
Lottery. Thirteen stores are linked up for the main weekly draw, with
another seven selling Camelot's ''scratchcards''.
Executive chairman Eddie Thompson also expects a 50%-plus increase in
Morning Noon &amp; Night's operating profits, which were #332,000 in the
last full financial year to March 25.
The big gap between the pre-tax and operating profit figures reflects
the hefty financing costs of what is still a young company.
Mr Thompson believed the hot summer was good for smaller stores. He
said: ''Convenience store trading gained from a good summer because
people would tend to go to the local store rather than travel a few
miles to their superstore.''
Since it began trading in June 1991, Morning Noon &amp; Night has spent
#3.8m on store acquisitions and capital investment.

STEWART Milne Group, the privately owned Aberdeen housebuilder,
boosted its profits last year by moving down-market and building flats
for first-time buyers rather than houses, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Pre-tax profits rose 5% to #5.25m in the year to May 31, while
turnover edged up 3% to #96m.
The company sold 630 housing units last year, up from 550 in 1993/94
as it increasingly turned to building flats rather than houses.
As a result the average price per unit fell to #75,000 from #88,000
and chairman Stewart Milne predicted a further decline to around #70,000
this year.
''Last year and this year there has been lot more development of flats
which we have been doing for first-time buyers,'' Mr Milne said.
''I think this is going to be a difficult year, but there is still
business to be done and hopefully profits to be gained,'' he added.
Mr Milne, who founded the company 20 years ago, said he would not
follow the Edinburgh-based Morrison Group into a stock exchange
flotation.
''It does not feature in our plans at all,'' he said.
Stewart Milne Group, which employs 800 people, is expanding outwards
from its heartland in Grampian region into the central belt of Scotland.
Its timber systems division, which sells and erects the frames for kit
houses, has even extended its market into England.
The company's five-year plan calls for further geographical
diversification and a doubling of turnover and profits by the year 2000.

THE Government has named December for the sell-off of the National
Grid which is to be floated on the stock market with an expected value
of between #3000m and #3500m.
The start switch was pressed on the flotation when the 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs) agreed terms for sale of their stakes in
the Grid. Electricity customers will receive a #50 rebate on bills under
the plan, it was confirmed yesterday.
A prospectus for the share sale will be published on November 22.
Shareholders of the 12 regional electricity companies will all get new
stock in the National Grid under the flotation proposals. Dealings are
expected to start on December 11.
The plan has been dogged by delay and political controversy in recent
weeks. Labour has strongly criticised ''windfall'' pay-outs and special
dividends that are likely to go to the directors of the Grid.
The National Grid was born out of reorganisation of the electricity
industry that took place in 1990.
The vast majority of the company's turnover and profits come from
operating the electricity transmission business in England and Wales.
Its other businesses include running connections with the network in
Scotland and France and operating the settlement system for the
electricity trading pool.
Organisers said yesterday that six regional electricity companies had
agreed to pass on ownership of the grid to their shareholders and that
six others, who have been in takeover bids, are reviewing their
position.

THE first severe gales of autumn brought widespread disruption to
Scotland yesterday.
Uprooted trees blocked roads throughout the country, and thousands of
Highland households were without power when electricity cables were
brought down. In Shetland, winds gusted at Hurricane Force 12.
A couple escaped unhurt when a 60ft tree crashed on to their bungalow
in Inverkeithing, Fife. Mr Derek Grater and his wife Sandra had finished
washing dishes and retired to bed when the tree smashed into their
kitchen.
Mrs Grater said: ''Fortunately our bedroom is on the other side of the
house, otherwise we wouldn't have stood a chance.'' The damage to their
home was so severe it might have to be rebuilt rather than repaired.
The storm was caused by a deep depression which tracked over the north
of Scotland. In many places, strong winds abated by daybreak, but gales
are expected to return today.

TWO consummate examples of European adult puppet making are appearing
until the weekend as part of the Theatre of Story/Theatre of Dreams
festival.
The name of Daniil Harms first came to my attention when his writings
formed the basis of the stunning Lithuanian trilogy seen at Dundee Rep
during this year's Edinburgh Fringe. And the early-century Russian
absurdist is also the starting point for Theatre du Fust's J'ai Gene et
Je Generai. Perhaps one day I'll read him in English and find out quite
what he's on about, for even a passable knowledge of French will leave
you guessing about this piece's deeper meanings.
It's billed as a Kafkaesque tale of a lodger sent to live in a full
housing block by an indifferent bureaucracy. That certainly comes into
it, but so does a whole lot else besides, and it's a shame not to
appreciate the full resonance, because visually it is a treat and
clearly the work of an artist (Emilie Valantin) of considerable skill
and vision.
Spain's Bambalina Titelles comes across not only as more accessible,
but also in the more intimate space of the Netherbow, as richer and more
concentrated than when the company brought the same show, Don Quixote,
to the Traverse three years ago.
As with Theatre du Fust, much mileage is achieved with the simplest of
means, and there is also much entertaining interplay between puppets and
puppeteers. At turns clever, funny, frightening, and touching, this
candle-lit show with a superb soundtrack by Joan Cervero, is a healthy
reminder that grown-ups appreciate the power of a good tale well told
just as much as children.

THE Royal Ballet has just opened its current season with the 801st
performance by the company of Swan Lake, in Anthony Dowell's traditional
version which dates from 1987.
The opening night featured a recent recruit from the Birmingham Royal
Ballet Company, Miyako Yoshida in the twin roles of Odette and Odile.
She was well partnered by the handsome Zoltan Solymosi.
Most ballerinas are better at one of the twin roles: Odette is the
sensitive swan, while Odile, daughter of the enchanter, has to be an
imperious and dazzling performer out to bewitch and impress not merely
Prince Siegfried but also the entire court.
Yoshida is a versatile performer with good stage presence and a
rock-steady technique but she does not yet occupy the stage as if she
owns it. This means that the larger-than-life style required by the role
of Odile currently eludes her. Perhaps she's slightly too polite and
just not selfish enough! As Odette, however, she's everything you could
wish; touching, innocent and utterly convincing.
The company seem on top form after their summer holiday. A particular
pleasure was the trio in the first act danced by Nicola Roberts, Deborah
Bull, and Errol Pickford. An unexpected additional delight came from the
playing of Tchaikovsky's marvellous score under the lively and
commanding baton of the Kirov Theatre's Viktor Fedotov. I hope he'll be
a frequent visitor to Covent Garden in the future.

POWERFUL gems turn up at the most unexpected of times, however, maybe
one shouldn't be surprised where Joe Penhall is concerned.
Last autumn his debut play, Some Voices -- a tender examination of
love and schizophrenia -- announced his arrival.
This second play again demonstrates Penhall's remarkable ear for
today's south London speech, and his characters' internal lives. Drole
and intense -- you can practically feel the veins stand out on the head
-- Penhall focuses on the lives of ordinary people struggling to stave
off despair and madness.
Pale Horse is a violent play, about violent emotions. It looks at
death and identity, the violence of bereavement and the inability of the
English male to cope with emotional crises except through violence. The
message is summed up in the explosive bulk of Ray Winstone's slightly
sleazy but basically decent bar-owner, blown wildly off course by the
sudden death (maybe suicide) of his wife.
Ian Rickson's beautifully judged, highly strung production (helped by
Kandis Cook's grey, glass-stacked bar) evokes the bleak and boozy
wasteland of Charles's existence with pathos and a kind of gallows
humour, as Charles grapples to control unfamiliar feelings and a rising
tide of barely articulated feelings of guilt.
Pale Horse perhaps ends too abruptly to suit all tastes, but as a
portrait of contemporary urban dissolution, the importance of love for
one's identity and, above all the handling of grief, it's an emotional
knockout with Winstone outstanding as the wincing Charles, and newcomer
Kacey Ainsworth awkward and defiant as his pick-up, waitress girlfriend.
But praise is due to all. Exceptional.

STRONG characterisation meant as much to Verdi as great singing, but
it was not quite enough to make up for the vocal weaknesses of this
otherwise resourceful little touring production of La Traviata, brought
to Edinburgh last night by Music Theatre London.
This was certainly opera on a shoestring, which really needed smaller
premises in which to make its effect. There was no chorus, and not much
in the way of decor. The orchestra was a quintet for piano and strings,
whose playing, from the side of the stage, was rather too redolent of an
old-fashioned palm court ensemble.
The general effect was by no means stilted, even if it was hardly the
meaningful modern Traviata the company would clearly have liked it to
be. There were no new insights, other than the implication that Aids
rather than TB was the cause of Violetta's death, and the party scenes
were about as outrageous as 1950s Fellini.
Yet, thanks to Verdi's indestructible genius and to Jill Washington's
sensitive Violetta, the performance held the attention. Nicholas
Broadhurst's stripped-down production had focus, and the musical
director, Tony Britten, kept things moving. True, the lack of a chorus
prompted some unhappy cuts, and instrumentally one longed for the sound
of Verdi's woodwind solos, but there were compensations in the inclusion
of music for Alfredo and his father often omitted from full-scale
performances.
The new English translation, with lines such as, ''You will never ever
know'', was nothing if not colloquial, but proved often distractingly
maladroit. The words, however, were clearly, sometimes all too clearly,
voiced, and nobody could have missed the message this updated Traviata
set out to convey. One more performance tonight, followed by The Magic
Flute on Friday and Saturday.

IN at the deep end here. If somebody can persuade the production team
in charge of Offenbach's operetta, La Belle Helene, which opened last
night at the Theatre Royal, to cut about half an hour from the show,
then Scottish Opera could have a very funny, exceedingly enjoyable
production on their hands.
This spicy production, by the French team of Patrice Caurier and Moshe
Leiser, hovers somewhere between Up Pompeii and a camp French farce. The
new translation, by John Wells, is -- in the way of Wellsian libretti --
very witty and overdone. The fault in the show at present, even allowing
for slack pacing on opening night, is double-edged.
On the one hand, the many sketches and dialogue scenes are
overstretched. Some of them -- such as the lengthy dice scene -- are in
themselves laboured. Worse than that, they slow down musical pacing,
creating huge gaps between musical numbers and short-circuiting
momentum.
On the plus side, it is beautiful to look at, with Christian Ratz's
designs producing their own gasp factor. (And there is a sensational
coup de theatre at the very end.) It is also terrifically cast, with a
back-up ensemble of principal singers who are potentially riotous --
John Mitchinson as the cuckolded Menelaus, Jonathan Veira's wonderful
High Priest, Andrew Slater's bullish Agamemnon, and Gordon Wilson's
thick Achilles, to name but four.
Up top (literally), Tracey Welborn's Paris, intially dangerously thin,
developed into a brilliant one-man act (guest appearance by Frank
Ifield), while, sweeping all before her, the stupendous Anne Howells in
the title role -- creamy, seductive, waspish, feline, and with dazzling
timing -- will blow your mind.
Emmanuel Joel conducted, tentatively at first, improving throughout.

A WELL-meaning Catholic parish priest with a soft spot for rebellion
-- ''Call me James'' -- invites a young man dying of Aids to stay in the
chapel house while he attends the hospital across the road. He insists
that there are no strings attached but John, a lapsed Catholic, arrives
suspicious of any attempts at homily.
Inevitably they clash, with John railing at what he sees as a
representative of an establishment which informed him that his love for
men was a mortal sin.
James meets the fury and invective with never-ending understanding,
gingerly side-stepping the arguments with bluff self deprecations.
''We're the Brothers of Thunder,'' he announces after one spat,
explaining that is what Jesus called the disciples James and John. ''He
was a right one for nicknames, was Jesus.'' His own, he confesses, and
demonstrates, is Father Talkalot.
Such gentle humour ripples through Anne-Marie de Mambro's play, adding
zest to what is otherwise a rather stagnant production. She handles her
material with assurance and technical competence but her exploration of
redemption through forgiveness is an unsophisticated one, grounded in
the most obvious religious symbolism.
For example, Simon (Tristan Hickey), the Californian beach bum who
inadvertently infected the inexperienced John, is crisply informed by
James that his biblical namesake died with scars on his face caused by
the tears he cried every day over his guilt at betraying Jesus.
Robert Paterson's James is a well-rounded, humane and complex
characterisation but Robert Conlan as John, cursed with some very trite
passages about fear of death, has an unfortunate tendency to over-emote
which pitches the piece into maudlin melodrama.

DOWNSTAGE three grafters are hard at it, seizing their tight packed
bin bags, doing a kind of ''you put your whole self in'' hokey-cokey
shake before moving on to the next corner and going through the same
routine all over again. And again. Round and round the four sides of the
block. Lift, shake furiously, replace, move on.
Upstage, one man has cut free from the tedious slog, if only for a
moment. All alone, in a thin corridor of light, he tangos to the lush,
romantic strains of a violin -- and to chortles of recognition from
sundry members of the audience. Chuckling not just because the moment is
deliciously absurd -- which it surely is -- but because it says so much
about the way different people function in the workplace, be it factory
floor or open plan office.
Tetrachord II -- a refining of a work-in-progress which Dudendance
showed in May -- deals in the petty tyrannies and individual obsessions
that govern a group of workers in some faceless processing plant. It has
stayed quite a pared back piece: the essential props are still plastic
carrier bags, the workforce still pace round the block like squaddies on
punishment drill. But it's a useful simplicity, uncluttered in its
presentation of ideas. The sheer daftness of the task -- tweaking
carrier bags into shape -- ably suggests the drizzling away of lives in
a monotony that carries a disquieting edge of worthless futility about
it.
The sheer size of the Tramway heightens the feeling of people dwarfed
by industry, bureaucracy, the system. It also allows Paul Sorley to
create yet another stunning, sculptural lighting plot while Jan
Feddersen's live soundscore cleverly accentuates the image of man as a
component of some insatiable machine, an image one finds, for instance,
in Fritz Lang's Metropolis.
Dudendance have much humbler resources by far, but Clea Wallis and her
team offer shrewd observations on the hidden structures that govern us
and they do so with an engaging streak of black humour. Repeated tonight
and well worth an hour of your time.

JONATHAN Harvey claimed his last play Boom Bang-a-Bang was nearer the
knuckle than his previous work -- and here he's slicing right through to
the bone, in a penetrative study of the fraternal relationship of two
Scousers in London.
They're both licking wounds; Shaun (Scot Williams) pining for his
absent girlfriend and Marti (Tom Higgins) steeling himself against
rejection, finding solace in lustful encounters in the dark rooms of
nightclubs because he's frightened of love.
Contemptuous of Shaun's indulgent pining and still resentful of a
gay-bashing at his hands seven years previously, Marti is nonetheless
drawn to his brooding sultry brother like a moth to a flame.
He's not the only one. Shaun's dingy bedsit on Rupert Street is like
Piccadilly Circus, with assorted loners drifting in and out, seeking a
sense of community in this unlikely venue. Louise, the earnest but
irritating English teacher from downstairs, needs someone to listen to
her inane chatter; Dean, the butch transvestite needs attention; while
Clarine from upstairs, who doesn't have a firm grip of her name or of
reality, is simply full of need, a bewildered victim of care in the
community.
From a bleak situation Harvey extracts maximum humour and he's not
afraid to show his teeth, deriving vicious laughs from the plight of
Clarine (a brilliant portrayal from Elizabeth Berrington).
There is an achingly moving moment when Shaun performs a dance of
desertion -- John Burgess's limp direction finally matching the robust
performances -- but in the final confrontation between the brothers,
Harvey seriously underestimates his audience with an over-long
delineation of a dynamic he has already perfectly evoked.

JOHN O'Keefe's 1791 romantic comedy is one of those that puts an awful
lot of effort into not going far. It's a long train of intrigue and
counter-intrigue, complicated by the disguises of an itinerant theatre
troupe, that concerns a runaway son, an estranged wife, a profiteering
marriage scheme, a performance of As You Like It, and rather a lot of
Quakers.
Throw in a sub-plot about a litigious neighbour, and you can see why
it takes most of the first half for this Royal National Theatre
production to get into gear. Directed by Jeremy Sams, whose music you
can hear in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia in the next fortnight in Glasgow and
Edinburgh, it is performed on an amusing cardboard cut-out set, designed
by Bill Dudley with a simplicity that seems like an antidote to his work
on The Ship and The Big Picnic.
Sams pitches it fast, though not as raucously as you might expect,
erring towards the gentility of the peace-loving Quakers rather than the
rough and ready coarseness of the pastoral characters. I imagine some of
the laughs are lost in the process, but the comedy does build as the
seeds of deceit and disguise start to grow and flourish.
Against the relentless energy of Andrew Sachs, the warm tones of James
Bolam (who'll be on home territory when they move to Newcastle next
week) and the placidity of the much-suited Sarah Woodward; Anton Lesser,
as the quote-happy actor Jack Rover, is the endearing, light-footed and
witty star of the show. The play may be intentionally lightweight, but
performances such as these give it if not substance then a feel-good
charm.

FOLLOWING his first serious foray into acting (Christopher Marlowe's
Edward II), his first major film part in The Secret Agent, a Franglais
show in Paris and a two-week tour of the Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland,
Eddie Izzard has brought his new show, Definite Article, to London. The
audience and critics are loving it and Eddie is showing all the signs of
loving it too.
''Eddie, I love you! I want to have your children,'' a woman heckler
screamed. Eddie Izzard, cross-dresser and language terrorist -- as he
describes himself -- is endearing. His sketches feature mice, elephants,
ants and sheep: he describes supermarket shopping and being at school.
The only recurring human in the act is his granny.
All of which is surprising when one considers his PVC trousers and
reputation for wearing dresses. But then surprising us is what Eddie
enjoys the most. His boyish grin becomes even more infectious when he
describes the Roman dead being catapulted out of their tombs, children
being stuffed inside tubas or the Bolivian football team being wrapped
up in his granny's hair net.
Eddie Izzard also describes himself as an all-round nice guy, which
may explain the animals and the fact that his constant use of the ''F''
word is rather sweet. There is nothing threatening about his act; he is
totally uninterested in politics, sex or violence. Eddie thrives on the
surreal -- the mynah bird strapped into the aeroplane seat, the sheep
having its hair cut.
The niceness of his humour could be his undoing, particularly when his
sketches are apparently unstructured and often have no ending.
But Eddie Izzard in full flow, coasting on his surreal fantasies,
carries the audience with him. ''Follow him, he speaks in sentences,''
was one of his gags -- in fact he should be saying ''Following him, he
takes you places.''

A CONSENSUS has been growing in the North in support of crofters'
trusts with ever greater force since the Assynt Crofters fired the
nation's imagination and took over control of their crofting estate in
1992.
Thanks for this are due to a quiet revolution in thinking which has
brought together a whole series of formerly unlikely allies from
crofting, business, landowning, conservationist, and local authority
quarters. Therefore, Secretary of State Michael Forsyth is far from
giving a lead with his proposals to offer control of Scottish
Office-owned estates. He is reactivating proposals the then Minister of
State Lord Sanderson of Bowden first offered five years ago.
Mr Forsyth should be aware, however, that confidence has risen
markedly among crofters since the Sanderson offer was treated with such
suspicion in SE Skye. The new value of community trusts is well
appreciated, as the Borve crofters and other communities, such as
Melness, are already showing.
The various centres of debate have been grouped around the Scottish
Crofters Union since its inception 10 years ago. Then in 1993, the RSPB
put in its twopence worth. This led last April to the publication of its
joint report with the SCU, entitled Rural Development and the
Environment. Ross &amp; Cromarty District Council's land user seminars also
produced a discussion document on land tenure in the Highlands called
the Dingwall Agenda in 1994. It has subsequently agreed to conduct a
feasibility study into establishing access for local people to utilise
land for new work. The results of this are likely to be offered to the
Land Working Group of the new Highland Council after next April.
Another of the reasons why Mr Forsyth has entered the debate is
because Mr James Hunter, former SCU director, received such wide acclaim
last month for his comprehensive analysis of the land reform agenda
which, among other things, reminded a wider audience of the competition
between Conservative and Liberal Governments early this century to
innovate in Highland land use policy. This fact was noticeably absent
from Brian Wilson's challenge to Mr Forsyth in The Herald.
Of course, Brian is in an awkward position for he has honourably
championed the crofting trust approach and opposed his party's main
legacy to crofters, the infamous 1976 Crofting Reform Act.
Far from extending croft lands it sought to reduce these even further
and also removed powers to sanction land settlement in the Crofting
Counties which had been extant since 1919 and which are once again much
in demand. The Labour legacy of running model crofting estates by benign
civil servants from Edinburgh is nothing to be proud of, especially
since Labour's Act specifically retained for all landlords the sporting
and mineral rights on the crofts which Labour was allowing crofting
tenants to buy.
Today the real challenge facing land reform in Scotland is to put
behind us the succession of tinkering measures produced occasionally
over the years under the stopwatch of scarce Westminster time. The
results have always been severely limited to grudging concessions by
Governments with other priorities and with no wish to upset the British
land owning oligarchy.
That is why so many involved in the debate in the North now look along
with James Hunter's Land Reform Agenda to it being properly debated and
delivered only by a Scottish Parliament.
Of course, if a miracle occurred at Westminster and some interim
measure was introduced to help Scots access land for new community
developments, this would be welcome, as Brian Wilson suggested. But he
is careful not to offer any programme himself. He is careful not to say
whether Labour's proposed Scottish Assembly would have powers to release
mineral rights and sporting rights to the new crofters trusts or to
remove the stranglehold of the Crown Estates Commission on inshore
development or seriously seek to oust absentee landowners from their
dead hand role in the Highlands.
Significantly, on the same day as Michael Forsyth chose to enter his
first bid in the land reform stakes, the Red Deer Commission was
explaining how the biggest deer cull yet contemplated would be required
to curb devastation wrought on the rest of the Highland environment by
such gross over-population of deer on commercial sporting estates.
It is no coincidence that the Highland consensus for reform sees the
absolute necessity to turn much of the degraded deer forest into new
lands ready for croft forestry, extensive regeneration of native
woodlands, and a great transformation of the eco-system of which the
Millennium Forest project is merely a tiny precursor.
To achieve these goals, which free nations such as Norway and other of
our European neighbours have successfully achieved, there will have to
be intervention by Government on behalf of local communities; yet
Michael Forsyth shows no political will to do what radical Tories did
early this century to promote local enterprise. That is no real
surprise.
But Brian Wilson's party must respond to James Hunter's challenge in
the Second John MacEwan Memorial Lecture, delivered in Dingwall last
month. Labour has to spell out precisely the extent to which its much
vaunted, tax raising assembly would be capable of delivering such a
radical package of reform. After all, the first premise of a Tony Blair
victory is to keep the property owning Home Counties sweet.
In contrast, an independent Scottish parliament, like Norway or
Denmark before it, would be able and willing, through an SNP
administration, to deliver land reform in full.

THE celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United
Nations must represent the ultimate in international junketing at the
taxpayers' expense (October 23).
Not content with the corruption, malpractice, and fraud so widespread
throught the EU, we must now endure a worldwide carnival of excess
centred in New York. Self-indulgence is unbounded.
Scandal after scandal unfolds across Europe on an ever increasing
scale. Excessive salaries, expenses, and allowances are the levers of
persuasion which ensure loyalty to a system now bearing many of the
characteristics of a long-running Roman bacchanal. A dissolute air
pervades the EU.
Last month saw a transport conference in Brussels being dined in an
exclusive restaurant where wine at #60 a bottle was lavished upon all
who attended, none of whom contributed to the expense. There is little
evidence of control, accountability, or morality.
The pursuit of power, international recognition and renown, the
privileges and inflated financial rewards are irresistible inducements
to support the system. Who dares question the popularity and profligacy
of so deep and inexhaustible a trough? Our MEPs or Members of
Parliament?
Right across Europe taxpayers are funding the excesses in office of
their representatives. Here, in Scotland, our intention is to create yet
another layer of government which can only benefit its instigators.
It is time to look beyond the braggadocio of the rival demands for
devolution or independence and confront the grim reality of a world
being fashioned by politicians for politicians.
The prospect of improvement in life for the ordinary people in
Scotland, come devolution or independence, is extremely remote; there is
every chance of it being worse.
What may yet save us is the dawning realisation that we have allowed
ourselves to become pawns in the bigger game of political
self-aggrandisement, played by those who, by aspiring to control our
lives, our pockets and our future, promote and secure their own
interests at our expense and in the guise of the common good.

THE column by Alex Salmond, MP, on the participation of Scottish
Office Ministers at meetings of the European Council is, as always, a
rant at the Government and a sideswipe at Labour (October 25). Just a
pity he failed to look at his own party's position.
When the Secretary of State for Scotland, or one of his junior
Ministers, attends EU Council meetings, they do so in the knowledge that
they can muster all of the United Kingdom's voting strength when
required: some 10 votes in all, the same as Germany, France, and Italy,
and two more than Spain.
If Mr Salmond had his way an independent Scotland would have just
three votes. When Scotland dared to disagree it would not be so much
Independence in Europe, more isolation in Europe.
An independent Scotland would be hopelessly marginalised in Europe,
the smallest of countries on the very periphery. Admittedly, Mr Salmond
would have his presidential limousine and a seat at the top table --
just a pity it would be a footstool.
Now, more than ever, we need the security and influence of being a
full partner within the United Kingdom, a partnership which can be used
to defend Scottish interests anytime and anywhere.

I READ Margaret Vaughan's article about the Scotland-London air fares
''war'' with a sense of puzzlement (October 26). Until now I had not
realised that the entire population of Scotland actually live at Glasgow
Airport itself.
Presumably that is the reason why the time and distance associated
with the ''home to airport'' leg of a proposed journey was only
mentioned in the context of Prestwick to which ''intending passengers
have to travel 35 miles from Glasgow''.
To add some balance, the price of a return ticket from
Prestwick-Stansted included free return rail fair from any point in
Scotland, and parking at the Ayrshire airport costs #7 per week. An
equivalent spell in Glasgow's car-park costs #24.50, while Glasgow
Airport does not have a rail station.
Everyone has different personal criteria for what makes the ''total
journey'' more competitive. This is underlined by the success of
Ryanair's Prestwick-Dublin flights.
It is especially disappointing to see The Herald again peddle the myth
that Prestwick is geographically remote and inconvenient when literally
thousands of Scottish holidaymakers choose to use Manchester Airport
each week.

ROY Rogers and Calum Macdonald both highlight new competition that
might at last reduce the scandal of domestic air fares to London
(October 19 and 20). What they both sadly fail to expose is the
deliberate restrictions that the airlines place on the cheaper seats.
Both British Midland and Air UK currently state that tickets are
subject to availability and, worse, must include a Saturday night
stop-over.
''Availability'' is a deliberate restriction which actually allocates
just a few seats on a fewer number of flights. Then the further
restriction of Saturday night stopover is added. This all adds up to
virtually taking away any chance of a cheaper seat.
Even if the flight is half-empty with spare seats, both British
Midland and Air UK do not release more seats at the cheaper rate and
would rather fly empty.
Standby charges remain a scandal and highlight dramatically the scam
these reductions really are.
Airlines should be asked to publish just how many cheap seats they
allocate and on which flights they are and explain why the Saturday
stopover is in place.

THE bias shown by your travel correspondent against Prestwick Airport
will not deceive those of us who must travel on a limited budget and
without the benefit of a company expense account (October 21).
The Scottish traveller has been faced with high air fares from
operators such as British Airways and British Midland for many years and
yet your correspondent is condoning this by advising the public to use
their services.
There may be ''only'' 15,000 seats per month at #59 available on the
new Ryanair service to Stansted but this is 15,000 more than existed
prior to the announcement of this service.
Instead of being critical of Prestwick Airport and the airlines which
use it why doesn't she use her investigative skills to find out why
other airlines have charged such high fares over the years and why they
only feel the need to reduce them, reluctantly, when a competitor enters
the market?
I would suggest she also checks the distances from Gatwick (Crowley),
Stansted (Bishops Stortford), and Heathrow (Hounslow) to London, all of
which are marketed as London Airports by other airlines. Better still,
she could undertake the journeys to see how long they take.
The journey from Heathrow by Underground in particular stands little
comparison to that by train from Ayrshire and it doesn't take an expert
in Irish geography to realise that.

BRITISH Midland in no way ''opposes'' Ryanair's new route from
Prestwick to Stansted (October 23). Indeed, as the airline which
pioneered competition on the Anglo-Scottish routes in 1982, we welcome
competition as it stimulates the market.
However, what we do object to is Ryanair's misleading reference to
Glasgow Prestwick airport in its advertising. As Katie Wood said,
''presumably Irish geography is in play here as Prestwick is not
Glasgow'' (October 21).

THE Skye bridge is yet another example of this Government's contempt
for the people of Skye, the people of Scotland, and all of the people of
the United Kingdom.
Surely any revenue from the bridge should go to the Crown
Commissioners as owners of all property and rents below the high-water
mark, not to some private body.
The withdrawal of the ferry service to coincide with the opening of
the bridge is in restraint of trade and competition under European law.
It should also be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

I READ Roy Rogers's article with great interest (October 19). My
daughter in Athens has indicated that she would like to come home for a
holiday at Christmas, the deciding factor being the transport from
Gatwick to Glasgow.
I had just spent half a hard day trying to get information by phone
from British Rail and various bus companies. This was so difficult I had
to travel into Glasgow to find out personally.
Bus travel would be 10 hours and a change in London. Train would mean
again changing stations in London. Flights from Gatwick to Glasgow by
Air UK would be #120.
The only other alternative would be an 848-mile round trip by car to
collect her which would probably mean two overnight stays.
We had this hassle in July as there is no direct flights from Glasgow
to Athens. Our choice of holiday cost us over #200 extra as we had to
take the car to Manchester and spend two nights in a bed and breakfast,
plus petrol and meals on the way.
If the Scottish Tourist Board thinks experiences like mine will
encourage people to travel to Scotland I am afraid I do not agree.

AT the press conference of SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls) in
Portree we asked for 100 people to be willing to refuse to pay the
extortionate tolls on the new Skye bridge and risk being charged by the
police for non-payment. By a week later the 100th person had crossed the
bridge and been charged.
The anger and resentment over these tolls, the highest or perhaps only
the second highest in the world (there is one other disputing the
claim), has been positively amazing in its intensity of feeling.
People of all walks of life and all ages, of all political parties and
none, and including at least one doctor, one minister of religion, and
one teacher have all now been charged. Practically all of those charged
with this so-called criminal offence have never had even as much as a
parking ticket before.
We are conducting an organised and disciplined campaign with a light
touch, but nevertheless we are determined to have these tolls removed.
We have now established a good relationship with the police and Mr
Russell Thompson, the bridge manager, and this is the way we are
determined to keep it.
Our protest is not against the bridge company, which is only doing
what it is allowed to do, nor is it against the police who are only
doing what they are told. Our protest is against the Scottish Office and
the Government.
SKAT will win this campaign as long as it is supported and led by the
people in Skye and Lochalsh. The more people support us in their
different ways the sooner we will succeed.

MR John Macnab advocates a change to Central European Time (October
23).
It is he, and not the opponents of change, who is behind the times,
since he bases his letter on outdated assumptions about child road
safety which simply do not stand up to detailed scrutiny. All the
current evidence available to Strathclyde Regional Council confirms that
the correlation between morning darkness and child casualties is
stronger and more direct than for late afternoon darkness.
For the West of Scotland a change to CET would result in sunrise later
than 9am for more than a quarter of the year, whereas under the present
clock regime sunset falls at or before four pm during only six midwinter
weeks (which include the Christmas and New Year school holiday.
It is clear that changing the clocks would greatly increase
schoolchildren's exposure to darkness-related accidents during their
journeys to and from school. It would also disproportionately affect
primary pupils who already suffer the highest accident rates even though
their school day ends well before the onset of midwinter afternoon
darkness.
Despite the misleading propaganda issued from an English perspective
by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (which, unlike
local authorities, has no statutory or operational responsibility for
road safety), the dangers to Scottish schoolchildren of a change to CET
were acknowledged by the Government in its 1989 consultation document
which recognised that school hours in Scotland might have to change as a
consequence of adjusting clock times by an hour.
Such an alteration in school starting and finishing times would of
course unravel even further the threadbare tatters of Mr Macnab's worn
and outmoded case.
If he is seriously concerned about child road safety there are far
more effective and worthwhile causes to adopt, such as the need to
enhance driver awareness of the effects of speed on pedestrian
casualties.

Council, 20 India Street,Glasgow.

IT was Christmas Day at the Meek house. We were about to consume the
beef, never did like turkey, and had already dented the wine when my
father-in-law noticed a small, battered, brown case lying against our
front door.
''Who could have left such a thing there?'' he wondered.
''Who indeed?'' I chorused, pretty sure it had not been S. Claus esq.
A few days before, I had been sitting alone in my office in the
Regional Chambers when the telephone rang and a chap in a very cultured
accent informed me he intended to rid the earth of my good self.
''We will come for you in the next few days,'' he promised.
The police assured me it was most unusual for murderers to ring up
their victims in advance ''but we would just like you to be careful, to
let us know if anything unusual happens''.
Like if a madman runs at me with a knife or someone leaves a little
brown case on my doorstep, perhaps? I called the constabulary.
A sergeant and a young officer arrived, looked warily at the object
before the head guy gave me the options.
''We could send for the bomb squad from Rosyth and they will certainly
want the whole block of flats evacuated; or I could just kick it.''
So, while the constable and ourselves hid behind a sofa, he booted it
down the stairs. There was no explosion.
''Someone is probably watching this and enjoying it -- we meet a lot
of sick people in this job.''
I gave him the drink they never take while on duty and he was gone.
Thank God for a police force, we said.
Not everyone agrees with that sentiment these days. Most people have a
police anecdote and many of them suggest the boys and girls in blue are
far from perfect.
''I had only been parked there for five bloody minutes; it's not my
fault the tax disc was still in the post; they should be out catching
real criminals'' -- we have all heard them.
I was watching a programme the other night about a middle-aged,
well-off, English lady who has suddenly become an animal rights
activist.
She allegedly feels it is perfectly permissible to lie down in front
of lorries, tramp over private property, and threaten farmers to further
her cause. In particular, she now hates the police.
''They are like stormtroopers in a police state,'' she railed, though
I would bet London to an orange she has experience of neither.
THIS week we have a report by the Audit Commission of England and
Wales which insists that bobbies on the beat don't beat crime.
''The vast majority of beat officers are badly briefed, ill-trained
and ill-experienced. Far better results are gained from intelligence-led
and specialist policing.'' I beg to differ.
In the past year, I have visited Marbella and New York, two cities
with Mayors who believe that an increased police presence on the street
is well worth paying for. And they have the crime stats to prove it.
The Spanish city has them on horseback at traffic lights and I didn't
see too many motorists going through on the amber.
In the Big Apple there are 3000 extra cops and street crime has been
cut by 20%.
I want to see more officers on the beat. It is absurd to suggest that
pick-pockets, muggers, car thieves and shoplifters are not deterred.
We do not have to look abroad to justify the case. In Lothian Region
the crime rate has decreased for each of the last three years, again
with a greater emphasis on patrols.
I think it is also time that the public began to appreciate the job
done by the constabulary. Those who know me will be aware that I am far
from an uncritical admirer.
There are rotten police officers, some who distort evidence, others
who lie in court, men and women who are not fit to wear the uniform. But
they are a tiny minority and most forces do their utmost to banish them
from the ranks.
I think of the very fine officers I have had the pleasure of knowing
-- Sir John Orr, who died a couple of weeks ago was one of them. He and
I went on a Border tour and it was obvious he was not just liked by his
force, they would have followed him through fire.
The same policeman who hands out the parking ticket, who towed away my
son's car last week, is the one who looks at the mutilated body of a
murdered child. And still has to get on with his job.
I saw some of the work done by officers during the hunt for the killer
of Caroline Hogg. They worked days, nights, weekends and none longer
than the senior officers in charge.
We expect a lot of these men and women while often giving back little
in understanding. The police are not perfect, they require to operate
under public scrutiny at all times. But I think they deserve our
support.
Here is another little anecdote which might amuse. A South African
policemen came to this land to play rugby for one of our leading clubs.
He has gone home again since he was arrested for drunk driving.
''The police don't arrest each other in South Africa,'' he was heard
to remark.
But they do here, and that is how it should be.
When the Prime Minister promised 5000 extra officers he struck a chord
with more than just the Conservative Party conference. The public wants,
and should have, the bobby on the beat.
The next time I find a suitcase on my doorstep I doubt if I will be
sending for the Audit Commission.

IT is good to know, is it not, that the Government is taking the
problem of the Irish Sea arms dump so seriously?
What with a promised Scottish Office survey and full co-operation from
the Ministry of Defence, folk in the south west can sleep easy in their
beds, safe in the knowledge that if anything chances to go bang in the
night, officials will be on the case.
Similarly, if any more of those potentially lethal ''phosphorus
devices'' -- the ones the MoD knows absolutely nothing about -- chance
to wash ashore, we can rest assured that no-one in Government will be
taken by surprise. Action will be swift.
In fact, action will be almost as swift as it was five years ago, when
Mr Robert McNeil of the now-deceased Observer Scotland reported:
''Residents on the coast near Stranraer are still awaiting an
explanation for mysterious inflammable objects found on Portpatrick
beach and taken away for analysis by the Ministry of Defence''.
Rab went on to quote an MoD spokesman who said it wasn't known what
the objects were, or where they came from -- stop me if any of this
sounds familiar -- but who confirmed that, after World War II,
ammunition was dumped in the sea between Britain and Ireland.
Local MoD police had, meanwhile, told a Portpatrick community
councillor that ''this problem had arisen in the past'' but assured him
''this material is not military''. So that was all right.
A week later, however, the local MP was on the case.
Mr Ian Lang (for it was he) said: ''I am raising the matter with my
colleague at the Scottish Office, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, who has
responsibility for environmental matters.''
Sadly, I can find no record of what, if anything, Lord James might
have felt able to tell his colleague way back in 1990. Funny that.
Left in the dark
THE annual row over the ending of British Summer Time has once again
divided the nation, with much of Scotland still clinging to the idea
that freezing darkness at 10am might not be all it's cracked up to be.
We make no political judgment of the fact, but one of the lobbying
groups loudest in the cause of reform rejoices in the name London First.
So who comes second?
Heard on the vine
FROM Shetland comes a copy of Grapevine, describing itself as a free
newsletter, and described by the Diary's far-flung mole as ''the latest
rival to the super, soaraway Shetland Times''.
To say it's a riveting publication is to say the least. Though much
taken up with the admirable task of singing the praises of unsung local
heroes, it also shows a little of the strain involved in any bustling
one-man operation.
''The Lifeboat Service -- the Serious Side'', says one eye-catching
headline for a story that (and we quote verbatim) reports: ''Both the
Lerwick and Aith lifeboats callouts, mainly occur during the night after
darkness and both the Hon Secretaries agree that, this in it's self
makes the job more difficult''.
Then we have the caption for a photograph: ''On the left is Hewitt
Clarke the Coxswain of the Lerwick boat, who has won many awards for his
effirts''. Next week: the Funny Side of the Lifeboat Service.
Meanwhile, there's the fire brigade tale (''House Fire Causes
Damage'', amazingly enough) in which ''smoke was able to be seen'', and
the school story in which, for the sake of greater authority, the writer
feels the need to quote himself ('' . . . as I said to her when I
visited the school, I wouldn't change jobs with any of the staff there
for love nor money!'').
For our part, we enjoyed the fact that many of Grapevine's
advertisements appear to be for itself -- ''Calling All Photograghers''
(sic); and ''Business Partner Wanted... to continue growth expansion''
(ditto).
Our favourite, however, is the front-page apology for the fact that
the newsletter will not be appearing for three weeks and expressing the
hope ''that this will not spoil your enjoyment of the Grapevine''.
Better than leeks
A LECTURE to be given at Edinburgh University tomorrow afternoon by Dr
Penny Harvey of Manchester University's Social Anthropology Department
beats about no bushes.
Its title: ''Not as Good as Disney but Better than the Welsh Garden
Festival: Consuming Culture at the Expo '92''.
You mean there's something better than a Welsh Garden Festival?
See Cosmo, see us
PREPARATIONS for a Scottish parliament continue apace, nowhere more so
than at the Jinglin' Geordie, an Edinburgh public house we may have
mentioned once or twice before.
Plainly aware of the needs of your average ''MSP'' to be, the
establishment now affords punters the racy luxury of champagne -- a kind
of French mineral water -- at only #10 a bottle.
True, this unbeatable offer is only available between the hours of
five and seen; otherwise the bubbly retails at a regular #23.
Nevertheless, regulars better accustomed to pie, beans, and optional
chips (presuming they haven't already had their tea) are still
struggling to come to terms with the culture shock of being a nation's
cosmopolitan capital again (again).
As if that weren't enough, they must now try to work out precisely
which digestif should accompany ''Coffee and shortbread, 95p''. Graves
may now be turned in.
In name only
A SMALL advertisement from the East Lothian Courier: ''Village Shoppe,
11a Main Street, Macmerry: I would like to thank all the patrons of the
'Village Shoppe' for their valued custom over the last 4[1/2] years . .
. Best wishes to you all . . . From Mr Grumpy, the Newsagent''.
Haste ye back
FINALLY, were we alone in finding it a little odd that Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth's ministerial car was stopped for speeding
while he was being driven towards deeply-marginal Stirling?

AWEEK in London and not a vagabond or desperate rogue to be found. Not
on the pavements anyway. We will come to Parliament later.
Where were they, the aggressive ones, the snarling, rancid-breathed,
fist-shaking, foul-mouthed mendicants of current political lore? Mind
you, the sun was out. Had they hied away then, for the autumn break,
packing their rags and swopping the pigeon-pocked howf under the pillars
at Victoria for a berth beneath the grimy elegance of Brighton pier? Who
knows?
There were plenty of blankets humped in doorways. Lots of lost boys
and girls, cruising the neon-lit night streets, for sale. The usual
quota of empty-eyed mishapes with cardboard signs and whiskery dogs.
Covent Garden fire-eaters bludgeoning passers-by with shame into paying
a pound for stopping to tie a shoelace. But accosted, we weren't. Nor
threatened.
We were mugged once only, by a perfectly legal scam involving the
legitimate sale of tickets for an open-topped 90-minute bus tour of the
traffic snarl-ups of London.
What is it about being a tourist that induces that state of catatonia
which renders you incapable of refusing to pay inflated sums for the
kind of sad activities you scoff at tourists enjoying at home? Is
sneering at tourists fair? The question is urgent only when you are one.
But why not? Fair dos means you get to sneer at them when their coach
tour -- Highland Highlights, Lowland Lowlights and the Islands, the 2
Day Tour -- stalls at a red light in Princes Street during the Festival
Cavalcade.
Mugs come along every minute, usually on the top deck of tourist
buses, bearing empty purses and sadsack expressions, vacantly fingering
the plaster Big Bens and naff tee-shirts, yours for four for a fiver
lady, which I've found make great floor cloths.
At Westminster, meanwhile, Michael Howard, spluttering words like
gobbets of hot oil across the chamber, was frying Jack Sprat for supper,
trying to save himself for the nation. It was the best show in town. The
political snake-oil merchant was only unhooked by the Straw Man's inept
attempt to snare him with logic. It was like watching Goliath staggering
around with a serious head wound while David was still looking for a
nicely shaped pebble.
Part of me felt ashamed at my lack of sympathy for Straw. Another part
of me, a much bigger part, didn't feel ashamed at all. For as a rule, I
reasoned, major cultural and political problems such as the increasing
numbers forced to give offence to opera-goers by sleeping under their
well-shod feet are not solved by people who live comfortably joining
Howard's game of Beggar My Neighbour, slubbering on about the threat
posed to civilisation, or at least BMW drivers, by small boys smearing
rags on windscreens.
WHAT is it about begging that so offends? On the flight home I leafed
through a research paper which tries to find an answer. According to Dr
Angus Erskine, a social policy analyst at Stirling University, an
encounter with a beggar is uncomfortable because it involves making an
immediate moral judgment in public. Secondly, such an encounter is
created by the supplicant. It is not of our choosing.
Dr Erskine found that as long ago as 1509, Martin Luther was
recommending the Straw/Howard approach to beggars. He identified the
deserving and the undeserving paupers.
The giving of alms to strangers in almost all major religious
traditions is an indication of goodness. But, in the Protestant
tradition, to ask for alms is a sign of weakness. To give was good, to
receive was a moral failing.
Luther's The Book of Beggars best articulates the ambivalant attitudes
towards them which have come down the centuries. It is the element of
passivity, or docility, which is central to understanding the
distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor. Moral
ambivalence towards beggars is a feature of literature on begging across
countries and across centuries.
What's of interest, Dr Erskine says, is that that which gave offence
in Elizabethan England, gave offence to the Victorians, and gives
offence still. The person with a hungry and homeless sign is proclaiming
their loss of voice, of power. The stranger walking up to another in the
street and asking for money is often experienced as aggressive or
threatening.
On the other hand, prejudice was once defined as a vagrant opinion
without visible means of support. Which, I think, makes both Howard and
Straw undeserving and offensive.

I AM proud to be a Scotsman and proud of this country. It is therefore
a source of continuing disappointment to me that we do not take our
tourism seriously.
Recently I holidayed in Argyll which in autumn is scenically
outstandingly beautiful. We read of countless thousands going from
Britain to New England to see the rich variety of colours as the leaves
turn from green to rich shades of red, brown, and gold.
I saw all those and more in our own trees but I saw no tourists. True,
the weather is changeable in Scotland but to my mind that is not the
critical issue.
As a nation we do not market our greatest asset -- our wonderful
landscapes teeming with flora and fauna. We do not market our natural
resources aggressively. We have the finest golf courses, exquisite
cuisine, and a unique and fascinating history.
I have holidayed recently in Southern Ireland where tourism is taken
seriously. Ireland is a beautiful country but none of its attractions
outmatch those of Scotland -- apart from one, and this, I feel, is the
critical factor.
While on many occasions in Scotland the quality of service I received
was excellent, too often the opposite was the case. Are we too lazy to
bother? Too laid back? Why do we always talk Scotland down?
If it's not the weather we're criticising it is the midges. Other
countries would turn these apparent negatives into positives. Are there
not ''beasties'' in Spain? Does the weather in Italy not damage your
health?
Instead of a scowl and a grudging response, let's see a smile. Let us
feel that we, the visitors, are there to be pleased. Let us take a pride
in our country and in showing it off to others. Let's not go for second
best.

As Britain and Argentina move closer, one subject still remains taboo,
reports Christian von Arnim.
IT may have been a coincidence, but it was symbolic nevertheless that
the first meeting since the Falklands war between a British Prime
Minister and the President of Argentina took place on the sidelines of
the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the UN.
For the private meeting between the two government leaders marks the
extent to which the gradual normalisation of relations between the two
countries is beginning to bear fruit.
Indeed, things have progressed so far that a visit to London by
President Carlos Menem, is a distinct possibility. After Mr Major issued
the invitation on Monday, British officials immediately played down how
soon such a visit might take place -- ''unlikely to visit London next
year'' said one.
But that does not diminish the significance of the invitation itself.
Hardly a man of understatement, the Argentinian ambassador in London
described this latest development as the ''rebirth of the old friendship
between Britain and the Argentine''.
Apart from the political need to remove the danger of a renewed
flare-up of trouble, there are, however, also sound economic reasons why
there should be such a blossoming of relations between Britain and
Argentina. While the war over the Falklands, or the Malvinas, to use
their Argentinian name, was fought partly for political reasons -- the
then military dictator, General Galtieri, used Buenos Aires'
long-standing claim to the islands to rally Argentinians and distract
attention from the deteriorating economy -- there were key economic
factors involved as well, namely oil and fish.
In a state of continuing political uncertainty, it would be impossible
to develop either of those natural resources to their full potential.
After all, what oil company is going to invest vast sums of money in oil
exploration in an area in which war might flare up again.
As a result, both sides saw the imperative of cementing a stable
peace. Full diplomatic relations were re-established in 1990, but the
first moves towards greater economic co-operation at government level
came with the oil accord signed at the end of last month.
It envisages the exploitation of oil reserves through joint ventures
in a designated 18,000 square-kilometre block straddling Falkland
Islands and Argentinian waters, with royalties being shared equally.
Already British Gas, for instance, has signed a letter of understanding
with the Argentinian company YPF for a joint venture in the region.
Furthermore, in a move of key importance from the UK point of view,
Buenos Aires has committed itself to take no action -- such as legal
claims or blacklisting -- against companies planning to become involved
in oil exploration in other parts of Falkland waters. Without such
reassurance, many companies would have been frightened off becoming
involved in costly oil exploration off the Falklands.
Having agreed to co-operate over the exploitation of hydrocarbons in
the area, the next step is a long-term fishing agreement. Six-monthly
agreements have been in existence since 1990, setting out the amounts of
fish which may be caught; but what the present negotiations hope to
achieve is to set up a long term framework for monitoring fish stocks
and preventing over-fishing.
The negotiators will also attempt to establish mechanisms for dealing
with anyone breaching such an agreement.
Again, such an accord will be of great benefit to the Falklands
themselves, since even now they benefit to the tune of some #20m per
year from fisheries. It is in their interest as much as anyone else's to
ensure that fisheries are properly controlled and fish, including
valuable squid stocks, conserved. The hope is that a deal will be agreed
within months.
Beyond these immediate accords, the longer-term aim is to expand trade
in general. At present British exports to Argentina, for instance,
amount to #220m per year -- a paltry sum given the economic size of both
countries.
But while friendship between Britain and Argentina may be reborn in
endeavours of this kind, the one issue which is still far from settled
is the sovereignty question over the Falkland Islands.
On the one hand Mr Menem has pledged to recover the islands, by
peaceful means, by the year 2000; Mr Major, on the other hand,
reiterated in a radio interview on Tuesday that: ''There is no doubt in
the minds of the Argentinians that we believe our sovereignty over the
Falklands is secure, not in the short-term, but in the long-term.'' And
furthermore: ''The Falklands would remain British for good.''
Both Buenos Aires and London have agreed to set the issue aside and
not to let it interfere with the process of rapprochement which is
currently underway, but each side is careful to state that any
agreements and accords which might be reached do not affect their
country's position on sovereignty.
Yet no-one is interested in pushing the point as far as confrontation.
As one Argentinian official explained, Mr Menem did not intend to set a
firm date by naming the year 2000 for a return of sovereignty. Rather he
was expressing an aspiration of the Argentinian people.
The hope must be that if relations thrive in other areas, an opening
will eventually be created which will enable the sovereignty question to
be settled one way or another. Nevertheless, the issue will remain a
taboo subject for a considerable time to come.
As for the other areas, however, normalisation is the name of the
game.

WE smell a rat. Specifically, one connected with the second piece of
information in two days which would lead any reasonable person to
suppose that the Government's move to the right, at least as far as the
issue of immigrants, asylum seekers, and other unfortunates of that sort
are concerned, is not so much a lurch as a landslip. Skeetering to the
bottom of this moral slag-heap is the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard,
who has already firmed-up his plans to turn employers into immigration
police and who allegedly intends to compound this by issuing a ''white
list'' of supposedly safe countries to which asylum seekers can be
returned forthwith. As the list is purported to include Nigeria, Sri
Lanka, and Algeria, all of them experiencing either civil war, human
rights abuses or both, an expression of disgust would seem the only
appropriate response.
We are not inclined to believe in the ''white list', at least as
alleged yesterday. It appears to bear all the hallmarks of
misinformation designed to impress us with how extreme the Government's
plans could be, only so that we may be relieved when the real plans are
revealed to be less outrageous. It is also crafted to draw Labour into
the debate in order that it may be portrayed as soft on immigration.
Does this in any way force a reappraisal of the view that the Government
is cynically and reprehensibly playing the race card for reasons of
political expediency? It does not.
There seems little doubt that the details of the new Immigration and
Asylum Bill will include some measures which will make it easier for the
Government to rebuff asylum seekers from countries which the Government
considers to be safe. Government ministers would like us to believe
Britain is under siege from waves of asylum seekers, most of them
attracted by our generous benefits and ample opportunities for
employment. No evidence of this has yet been produced. In any case, only
4% of applicants for refugee status are successful and this hardly
constitutes a drag on the British economy or a threat to our way of
life.
What the issue represents is an attempt by the Government to recast
the 1993 Act which brought in fast-track procedures for processing
asylum applications. There is no argument about the fact that Britain
needs immigration and asylum procedures for its own good, as does every
country. Sending genuine asylum seekers back to places where they will
face physical harm should have no part in the policies of a decent
nation.
Why, then, has this type of policy, whatever the final detail, been
proposed? The answer lies surely in domestic politics. The calculation
has been made that being tough on immigrants and asylum seekers will
gain electoral approval for the Tories. It may well do so, but at what
cost? A further question presents itself. What has happened to the
political party which reproached Mr Enoch Powell but which now fetes Mr
Howard and those of similar views? The answer to this question should be
couched more in sorrow than in condemnation. The centre of the Tory
party has lost both ground and faith in itself.
Party leaders, when casting round for thinkers of enterprise and
workers of energy, find these predominantly on the right. The crisis of
the Tory party has skewed its direction and the result is that
honourable politicians in the Cabinet, like Mrs Shephard, Mr Lang, and
others, find themselves in a position where the internal logic of the
party has left them behind. We said yesterday that such issues convince
us we live in sad times. They are sad, also, for the Conservative Party.

THE National Lottery has been a remarkable success and an equally
remarkable source of controversy. That need hardly be suprising --
collecting and distributing enormous sums of money excites the
imagination and is bound to generate argument, especially when the
public good is supposed to be at the heart of what is indisputably a
gambling device.
Only with Premium Bonds has the state played a direct role in
promoting gambling before; and there the element of gambling is
relatively modest (the capital sum advanced by the bond ''savers'' is
not itself hazarded) as are the actual returns which are related to the
sort of money the Treasury would have to pay to service straightforward
public debt.
The Lottery by contrast puts the whole stake at risk, at enormous
odds, and pays winners varying amounts, of which the topmost are
immense. Immense is also the word for the profits made by the lottery's
managers. These could not have been anticipated in the beginning, and
they do reflect on the energy and efficiency of Camelot, the company
involved; but to most people they seem indefensibly large. They would be
reassessed even by the present Government were it in power when the
opportunity for that was reached, but Labour believes instead that the
whole business should be managed on a non-profit making basis, as was
actually suggested in the beginning by Mr Richard Branson. Managers
would, no doubt get a professional fee, and it would be substantial; but
it would not run into the mega-millions enjoyed by Camelot, and the
difference would swell the funds available for good causes. This switch
seems thoroughly desirable.
Other Labour proposals would seek to defuse the dissension about
identifying would-be beneficiaries and making sure allocations are made
with some reference to geographical fairness. Labour wants to involve
the public in these matters by setting up a Consumers' Council to
augment and oversee the work of the Lottery regulator. It also wants to
make sure that Lottery monies are used additionally to state spending on
the areas earmarked for Lottery funds rather than being used to replace
public money. The Government rejects the suggestion such replacement is
in fact taking place, but suspicion is widespread that an element of
this is involved in some grants, and it may easily grow with time and
the proliferation of grants.
The Government is minded to oppose such suggestions root and branch
and, enthused by the evident success of the Lottery in attracting large
sums, would settle for self-congratulation. That is irrational. That the
Lottery is a success does not mean its operations cannot be refined to
enhance its public value and widen the range of opinion which recommends
its disbursement. There is no compelling reason why major allocations
should always engender dispute (though that is bound to occur from time
to time) and if simple reforms can avoid dissension, the case for them
is overwhelming.
More fundamental objections to the Lottery, such as those advanced by
the nation's churches, are in a different category for they are not
concerned with the operation and management of the Lottery but are in
fact opposed to its very existence. It seems unlikely that any
Government, regardless of its political complexion would jettison such a
convenient source of spending on good causes. The Lottery is here to
stay, and the hope has to be that its benefits outweight its
disadvantages.
They will only do so when it is perceived to be an instrument of
widespread public good, something which ought to compel its operational
reform from time to time.

William Russell explains why the entry of Sir James Goldsmith to the
election fight should be taken seriously.
IF ever there was a man who puts his money where his mouth is, it is
Sir James Goldsmith, the 62-year-old multi-millionaire who funds the
Referendum Party. Already a French MEP for L'Autre Europe which got
12.3% of the vote in France at the European elections, he is now bidding
to become a British MP, his intention of fighting a Surrey constituency
at the next General Election being announced yesterday in a series of
newspaper advertisements.
The Referendum Party, formed in November 1994, plans to field
candidates in British constituencies where the sitting MP refuses to
endorse the need for a referendum on closer European integration, their
sole policy platform. While Labour shakes in its shoes at the prospect,
it is even more worrying for the Tories in seats they hold where Labour
is narrowing the gap.
If Tory voters, reluctant to make the jump to Labour, but wishing to
punish a Government they feel has let them down, opt for the Goldsmith
candidate to make their protest, then the sitting Tory could lose. Sir
James is no socialist, but letting Labour in is a risk he apparently
thinks worth taking.
Goldsmith is out to save Europe from itself. Nothing less. His Europe
des Nations group believes Europe is going in the wrong direction, and
that the Parliament and Commission are contriving to build a European
superstate. The youthful James had few illusions about the power of
money, and has fewer today.
A slow reader, he announced aged seven: ''When I grow up I am going to
be a millionaire and hire someone to read for me.'' He can do that here
to the extent that he can fund people to stand for his party, but
without the organ grinder putting up too they would end up looking like
a lot of monkeys. This way, with a large candidate list, the party will
have access to television and radio political broadcasts, and have the
right to be treated on all fours with the other political parties. He
also has the cash to fund his propaganda, something protest parties
usually lack.
So far he has attracted one big name -- Sir Alan Walters, former
economic adviser to Lady Thatcher, who has pledged he will stand against
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, but others could follow.
Sir James claims not to be anti-Europe and, to be fair, he is
something of a continental mongrel, indeed more European than most. His
family, originally called Goldschmidt, came to England at the end of the
last century from Frankfurt. His father, Frank, entered politics,
getting elected to Parliament, but the anti-German feeling generated
during the First World War ended his political career and the family
left England. Frank entered the hotel business in France.
When the Germans invaded in 1940 the Goldsmiths escaped to England and
then headed for the Bahamas. They returned to Britain after the war and
James went to Eton, leaving at 16. All the signs were he was heading for
the traditional fate of the playboy -- cigarettes, whisky, betting and
wild, wild women.
He was 20 when he met Isabel Patino, daughter of a Bolivian tin
magnate, and fell in love. Her father objected. She was sent away.
Goldsmith followed, and the pair eventually eloped, heading for Scotland
pursued by the press and her father, who tried to stop the marriage in
the courts, but failed.
The couple were married in Kelso and the nation rejoiced at love
conquering all. It was probably the only time in his life he has been an
admired national figure.
His wife died of a brain haemorrhage in childbirth a few months later,
and Goldsmith returned to France where he immersed himself in work. He
made a lot of money, especially from slimming products, and this allowed
him to embark on a hugely successful career as a takeover king, which
started in 1971 with Bovril.
In 1976 he was knighted in Harold Wilson's notorious lavender
resignation honours list, and in 1979 amid a great deal of ballyhoo, set
up Now!, a political news magazine of all the talents which folded
almost immediately.
Over the years his private life became extremely complicated -- he has
been married twice, there have been many other women, and his seven
children are by four different mothers -- but his wealth, he is
Britain's seventh-richest man, has cushioned everything.
It was after his $13 billion bid for the conglomerate BAT Industries,
Britain's third-largest company, failed in 1989 that he turned his
attention to the decline of the West and decided to do something about
it. He would enter politics.
The politicians were suitably amused. Magnates have made such threats
before and been seen off. But at the 1994 European elections he was
returned to the European Parliament for a French seat and it soon became
clear he was to be reckoned with.
He is head of a 19-strong group of MEPs, 13 of whom are French, and
while undeniably eccentric should not to be dismissed by British
politicians in the traditional manner reserved for odd-ball,
single-issue candidates. This issue is unique in the emotions it
arouses. This candidate not only means business, he has the means to
mean it.

winning the battle against unemployment and deprivation.
WHEN Catherine McCrory was growing up in Govan she remembers it as a
thriving community full of shipyard workers. ''Then all of a sudden
there were vast numbers of people without a job. You had to get into a
new frame of mind if you wanted a job. You had to take the view that
there was something out there if you were prepared to go for it.''
So when Catherine was made redundant from her job at Littlewoods Pools
a few months ago, she opted for a course in telebanking. Cross your
fingers for her today. She's got an interview with the TSB.
Catherine's story echoes that of the Govan Initiative, the community
regeneration company which is running her retraining course. It was
formed nine years ago when a trail of derelict land, an unemployment
rate of 30%, a legacy of poor housing and social problems and a
desperate image problem were threatening to drag the area further into
the mire unless there was a radical rethink.
Yesterday the author of a report on the role of the new community
sector from the respected Joseph Rowntree Foundation gives Govan
Initiative a truly glowing report. ''What's been achieved there has been
pretty stunning,'' says Stephen Thake of the University of North London.
By ''community sector'' Thake means non-profit-making groups such as
community development trusts and housing assocations as well as projects
established by churches, local authorities, and government initiatives.
He reveals that these bodies are the secret weapon in the drive for
urban regeneration. They can't walk alone. They need to operate
alongside national and regional initiatives but Thake believes they can
do things which these loftier bodies cannot. Because they work closely
with the communities they serve and can respond quickly and flexibly to
problems as they arise, these projects have a unique power to turn an
area around.
But he warns that they tend to be hamstrung by funding insecurity and
that in Scotland local government reorganisation threatens the very
existence of some of the most successful projects.
This week Tayside Community Business in Dundee, commended by Thake for
their success in creating viable stand-alone businesses in areas
desperate for jobs, and recipient of #131,000 of lottery ''good causes
money'' is fighting for survival after a proposal from the new unitary
authority in Dundee to wind up the company and withdraw its funding.
Because these projects are more flexible than other national and local
government agencies, and because they are based in areas with
hard-to-crack social and economic problems which call for radical
high-risk strategies, they sometimes get into difficulties.
Two projects named in the report are Ferguslie Park Community Holdings
in Paisley, the subject of a Scottish Office investigation into the use
of urban programme money, and Drumchapel Opportunities, which needed a
#500,000 rescue package from its public-sector backers to prevent it
going bust last year.
One problem is that there appears to be a shortage of the special
blend of skills required to run such projects. Thake summarises these
skills as the ability to develop local partnerships, assemble complex
packages of public, private, charitable and European funding, and
deliver projects on the ground.
He dubs these men and women as ''social entrepreneurs''. Ron Culley,
chief executive of Govan Initiative Ltd, a former social worker and
something of a maverick, perhaps best exemplifies this new breed.
When the project was launched in 1986 it had an annual budget of
#54,000 and three staff. I remember visiting its vast empty office at
Ibrox when it contained just one desk and a telephone. Today Govan
Initiative employs more than 100 people and runs more than 40 projects.
Its turnover this year will be more around #3m. Its motto is ''Nihil
Sine Labore'' (Nothing Without Work) and it is a case study in hard
graft.
Culley and his board decided that simply bringing Govan up to the
Glasgow average wasn't good enough. ''Who wants 14% unemployment as a
goal?'' asks assistant director Raymond Hendry. That's why their mission
statement aims to extablish Govan as ''one of the best-performing inner
areas of any city in the United Kingdom''.
In an area like Govan this involves a lot of lateral thinking. As
Culley explains: ''There's no point trying to regenerate an economy when
everyone's taking drugs. There's no point creating jobs for women if
there are no childcare facilities.'' So from the start the policy has
been one of economic and social cohesion, which involves taking the
widest possible view of economic development.
For example, how many economic development organisations run an annual
bonfire? ''We realised that every year in the run-up to November 5 the
kids were breaking into empty houses and pulling up the floorboards,
adding to the problems of vandalism and dereliction,'' says Hendry.
Govan Initiative's solution was to organise a massive annual bonfire
party and invite the whole community. Last year more than 3000 turned up
and the annual cycle of break-ins was broken.
There are plenty of other examples. For instance, the installation of
security equipment to help halt the haemorrhage of businesses from the
area; the introduction of free health checks and advice among workers in
an area with just about the highest rate of cardio-vascular disease in
the world; the opening of a number of nurseries to encourage women,
especially lone parents, to get back to work; the creation of a theatre
company, Theatre Works, whose members were all previously unemployed.
To encourage businesses to set up in the area, the Initiative has
taken on a property development role, building last year the Festival
Business Centre in Brand Street, Ibrox. It has already attracted 24
companies. Their latest idea is the creation of training courses
specifically designed to equip some of the 2000 people in Govan still
out of work for employment at the Savacentre due to open on the Braehead
site in two years' time.
There's still a long way to go. Unemployment is down to 16.3% but it's
still higher than the Glasgow average. There are still vast areas of
derelict land, particularly along the Helen Street corridor. Crime,
though down 7.3% last year (with break-ins down 22.4%), is still high.
The overall conclusion must be that progress so far has been impressive.
Thake says Govan Initiative is a good example of the way the community
sector can deliver solutions which are right for that particular area,
whereas local authorities and other public agencies one step removed
tend to hand down standardised solutions.
''There's a massive amount community regeneration organisations like
this one can do in making local government more flexible and responsive,
but they need more recognition and more support,'' says Thake.

ALLAN LAING meets David Calder who is making the most of grey hairs
and graces.
DAVID Calder has his heart in the right place. It is a Wednesday
afternoon and he's sitting at home, watching television. A re-run of
Flying Doctors, perhaps? Or maybe an old movie on Channel 4? No. He's
glued to the set in a bid to find out early doors if Home Secretary
Michael Howard, embroiled in the row over the sacking of the Prison
Service boss, is for the high jump.
He hopes so, for there is no love lost between the 49-year-old actor
and the Tory Party. A socialist then? ''Well, how can you not be in this
society?'' he remarks. ''I really long for the day when this Government
does just disappear down the shoot of irrelevance. I think it is an
appalling state we are in, run by a bunch of total incompetents. We have
an unprincipled Government.
''Men like Howard have no regard for the consequences of what they do
to people. But we don't want to get in to all that, do we?''
Well, revealing though it is, we don't. Enough about the Lords of
Misrule; what we want to do is talk about Calder's latest television
roles. He is currently appearing as the priest, Father Michael Harvey,
in Jimmy McGovern's devastating Cracker story, Brotherly Love. And, to
balance matters, he is set to play Falstaff later this week in the BBC2
Performance adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry IV.
While most actors of his vintage anguish over the ageing process (they
are pushing 50 and the cracks are beginning to show upon their once
photogenic faces), Calder accepts the inevitability of growing older.
This may not be unconnected with the fact that he looks -- and, indeed,
seems always to have looked -- much older than his years. For him it is
a blessing.
Though he does make an exceedingly splendid villain when called upon
to do so, he has a habit of playing avuncular roles; characters of
authority. He does a very good senior uniformed policeman, for instance.
And one of his finest TV performances was as the father of a Falklands
War veteran in Tumbledown. He is the perfect paternal figure in ITV's
period medical drama, Bramwell (the second series of which he is filming
now).
''I feel that, as an actor, I'm very much at the top of my powers at
the moment. Things have really come together for me. If you stick a dark
wig on me then, of course, I can look a lot younger. But I've got grey
hair and I'm losing it all on top. So I have to miss out on some of
those younger roles. I couldn't be a Romeo but there are so many really
wonderful parts, big guns like King Lear, Prospero, and Antony,'' he
explains.
Calder is one of those exceptional (and fortunate) actors who can
comfortably shuttle between the classical theatre and the television
drama. His name is strongly associated with the RSC. In recent years he
has played a much-acclaimed Shylock, a superb Boss Mangan in a Trevor
Nunn production of Heartbreak House, and a frighteningly accurate
Gorbachev in Moscow Gold.
But what Calder loves most -- and it is something which he is not
renowned for -- is comic roles. He does like to make people laugh. So
Falstaff, one of Shakespeare's merriest old rogues, is a part which the
actor relishes.
''I saw the final product the other night for the first time and I was
thrilled to bits. Falstaff is a funny character but the reality of why
he is funny is because he survives by his wits. He has no money, no
family . . . he has nothing. He is a complete opportunist,'' he says.
Henry IV also stars Jonathan Firth as Prince Hal, the feckless and
irresponsible heir to the throne who prefers to spend his days in the
Boar's Head in Eastcheap (hey, don't we all). Here, perched upon his
shoulders like a hobgoblin, sits Falstaff, a corrupting and devilish
influence.
By faithfully reproducing stage plays for television, the Performance
series serves to bring the theatre into the home. Does Calder, with his
vast experience of both mediums, think it works?
''I think it is great. It offers this tremedous intimacy. The idea of
speaking to an audience through a camera is a perfect opportunity to
bring both mediums together. It is something I find very thrilling as an
actor.
''Of course, there is something you can't replace in terms of being on
a stage. That communion that you get between the audience and the
actors. It is live and you are there at the moment of it happening,'' he
adds.
So what of his experiences on Cracker? ''It's great to be able to say
that you're working with the two top writers of television drama --
Jimmy McGovern and Lucy Gannon (Bramwell). McGovern has a way of
realising a character without saying too much so that he is not saying
'Well, here is a Roman Catholic priest and he's someone in a funny
costume who you only turn to on a Sunday'.
''This is a man of the community, a tough man who faces the same moral
dilemmas as the rest of us. He is confused and fearful,'' he explains.
David Calder is refreshingly realistic about television. Sadly, he
believes that an actor has to gain a certain public status before he or
she will get access to the best work.
''This means that production companies are unwilling to take risks
with people and so opportunities for young actors are reduced more and
more and more. Everything is about selling the product nowadays and the
content of the product starts to be dictated by the drive for success
and the selling process. Can the actor sell it? If you don't show a
profit then you go down.
''Young actors and directors become commodities. We always have been,
mind you. We have always sold our skills. But whereas before it was
accepted that it was perfectly proper to make programmes that only
2,000,000 people would see, now they say it has to be 10,000,000. It is
ratings led. We have yet to see where it all leads but my starting
position is one of deep mistrust,'' he explains.
* Performance is on BBC2 on Saturday evening.

John D Pollock, BSc, FEIS -- An appreciation by Fred Forrester
TO SUM up John Pollock's life in a few paragraphs is next to
impossible. He had a number of characteristics which were, at first
sight, contradictory.
His oratory and political nous were legendary. At the great teachers'
demonstrations of the eighties, the audience hung on his every word. His
television appearances were memorable. He handled press conferences with
a mixture of incisiveness and humour.
His background in Labour politics had trained him to see through
politicians of all parties, separating truth from rhetoric, reminding
them of their earlier statements, challenging his old political allies
where the teachers' cause so demanded.
He was the great moderniser of the EIS, sweeping away the remaining
traces of teachers' professional cringe, building a modern educational
trade union which was the envy of many teacher organisations in Britain
and abroad.
Under Pollock, Scottish teachers made substantial progress in regard
to both salaries and conditions. These gains are perhaps more obvious in
retrospect than they were at the time, and the 1987 Main Report
settlement did involve some worsening of the conditions negotiated under
Pollock in 1976.
Pollock was much criticised for his intervention in the ballot on that
settlement, but he believed that leadership demanded nothing less. He
sat impassively on the platform at the subsequent annual general meeting
when a motion of censure on him was debated and defeated.
At EIS headquarters, he was known as a hard task-master. Officials and
staff were expected to be on top of their brief at all times. A shaky
argument or a poorly prepared case would be instantly demolished. Yet,
in private, he was the most generous and understanding of men,
responding readily to the personal difficulties of any staff member.
His devotion to Ayrshire and to Burns were such that he found real
difficulty in uprooting himself and settling in East Lothian when he was
appointed EIS General Secretary. However, he had the support in this of
his wife, Joyce, and his family, who became so attached to Longniddry as
to prevent Pollock from returning to Ayrshire upon his retirement.
Although Pollock commented wryly on this, I suspect that he had become
reconciled to his new surroundings, to the point where the photograph of
him on the Longniddry Bents in Monday's Herald seemed totally
appropriate.
* THE news of John Pollock's death in Majorca on Sunday was deeply
saddening to all who knew him, his kindness, and his humanity, which
were too often ignored by friends and enemies alike who saw only his
consummate political skills, writes David Ross.
There are many who owe John Pollock a great deal. A man of honour, he
takes with him the deep respect of most and the sincere affection of
many more than he might have thought. But he leaves behind a mystery.
To those who knew him or observed him since he took over the general
secretaryship of the EIS in 1975, having turned down the safest of
Labour seats, it was clear that he had a major contribution to make to
Scottish public life. He seemed to know almost intuitively how to
massage our participative democracy into working for trade-union
interests, against all the enormous odds.
It seemed certain that the Ayrshire man who: quite literally, was
bounced on Jimmy Maxton's knee and sat at Nye Bevan's feet; who chaired
the Scottish Labour Party twice and the STUC once; who oversaw the EIS's
transformation from a professional anachronism to arguably the most
sucessful teacher union in Europe; who led Scottish teachers when they
became the first public-sector group to force the Thatcher Government to
turn; and who was widely seen as the best public speaker in Scotland,
the greatest Secretary of State we never had, was not finished yet.
He had said he had wanted a quiet life, but nobody believed him. Just
60-odd when he retired in 1988, there was plenty time left for the House
of Lords, Europe or whatever. He started as though he meant to return to
the Labour Party politics, he had undertaken to abandon on going to the
EIS.
Invited to Skye by the local Labour Party in that September, he
astonished many by preaching that the Scottish Labour movement should
see its future in an independent Scotland within an integrated Europe,
and that only Labour could deliver this.
He never made national headlines again, until Sunday.

John Chant, born 1938, died Edinburgh October 24, 1995
JOHN Chant, director of social work in Lothian for six years, has died
at the age of 57, only a few weeks after illness forced him into early
retirement.
Mr Chant had been ill since June and had to have a kidney removed. He
was later admitted to St Columba's Hospice, in Edinburgh, where he died
on Tuesday.
Brought up in Somerset, his earliest experience of the social services
came in his formative years after the deaths of both his parents. He was
raised in local authority care and throughout his professional career
demonstrated particular concern for improvements in that field.
Mr Chant started working life as a farm boy, then trained as a
psychiatric nurse before studying to be a social worker at Edinburgh
University.
He rose to become director of social work in Somerset in 1975 and
remained in the post for 14 years. His role as honorary secretary of the
Association of Directors of Social Services from 1982 to 1986 was
recognised with the award of the CBE.
Mr Chant moved to Lothian as director in 1989. He was selected in 1991
to serve on the Ministerial task force set up to examine the HIV-Aids
problem in Scotland and in 1994 served in a similar role in a study of
drug abuse.
He was also chosen to represent Scottish interests on the Central
Council for Education and Training in Social Work and chaired the
organisation's Scottish committee.
A devoted family man, he is survived by his wife, Joyce, and three
adult children -- a son and two daughters.
The funeral service is to be held at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh
next Tuesday. It will be followed by a private burial service.

The Very Rev Dr Ronald Selby Wright, churchman and Radio Padre; born
June 12, 1908, died October 24, 1995 -- An appreciation by R D Kernohan
RONALD Selby Wright was a gracious and gifted man who all but outlived
his fame. He was hardly known to most recent members of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, of which he was Moderator in
1972-73. In recent years he had serenely come to terms with growing
infirmity.
But in his wartime role as the ''Radio Padre'' -- helped by BBC
monopoly and concentration of radio services -- he reached a
congregation almost certainly vaster than any regularly commanded by a
British clergyman before or since.
That was a crowded, if extended, hour of glorious life. The rest was
hardly ''an age without a name'', for it encompassed not only 40 years
as minister of the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh and much other successful
religious broadcasting but a remarkable range of dignified chaplaincies;
to the Queen, latterly as an extra chaplain; to the Royal Company of
Archers; to Edinburgh Castle and its governor; and as an honorary senior
chaplain to the forces.
He also developed a role as a kind of chaplain-consultant to several
leading independent schools and (though not by means the same political
persuasion) spoke kindly of a promising Fettes lad called Tony Blair.
Yet nothing in these diligent services and eminences matched the way
he responded to the opportunity that came his way at the stage in the
Second World War which Churchill called ''the hinge of fate''.
Selby Wright had been a Territorial Army chaplain and continued in the
early stages of the war to serve with the 7/9 Royal Scots, sharing in
their brief and perilous foray into France just before the fall.
But he had already attracted the good will of Melville Dinwiddie,
soldier turned minister turned BBC Scottish controller, and had been
encouraged to broadcast for 10 consecutive Sundays in the style of his
very successful Canongate boys' club, developed from one which he had
led under St Giles' auspices.
Dinwiddie, though often at odds with London on religious matters,
introduced Selby Wright to the great high priest of BBC religion, James
Welch. A series of four ''Let's ask the padre'' talks in November 1941
led to full-time secondment to the BBC in 1942.
Selby Wright flourished as Radio Padre till 1944 (when he went to the
10th Indian Division in the Middle East as senior chaplain) and the role
continued after a fashion till 1947. It broadened far beyond the initial
aims of diverting criticism of inept epilogues and providing a
chaplain-substitute for men in scattered units, espcially on restive
anti-aircraft sites ''with women personnel''.
As a broadcaster he had a direct simplicity of style recognised even
by modern radio historians who find some of his attitudes
''patronising''. At his best, in the straight talk, he had the gift of
sharing his faith and speaking to his audience (usually about 7,000,000)
as if he were talking across the room to each of them individually.
Some of the scripts that now seem incongruous, such as interviewing
Archbishop William Temple about the Church Commissioners' property
holdings and the Church's post-war social programme, were clearly
someone else's idea.
What may now seem patronising was at the time a happy, genuine, and
brilliantly successful middle-way between bogus mateyness and clerical
solemnity that too often in others became pomposity.
Though much of the appeal was to civilians, Selby Wright also
developed Army contacts which he cherished all his life -- and which he
sustained from Scotland for many years as editor of the forces'
supplement to the Kirk's magazine Life and Work.
Ronnie Selby Wright appeared as an ''establishment'' figure, despite
the modesty and simplicity of his lifestyle and demeanour. Yet he
committed himself to his Canongate ministry -- his only parish charge,
though he had been an assistant at Glasgow Cathedral -- when the lower
end of the Royal Mile was far poorer and more populous than today. He
was also a Moderator who overcame the considerable handicap (at least in
that office) of being a bachelor.
He had a popular and personal touch which served the Kirk well,
happily visiting all points between Nunraw Abbey and the Daily Express,
touring Indian churches, and mildly embarrassing the editor of Life and
Work by his eagerness to thank personally in print virtually everyone he
met on his tours.
He was a good and kind Christian, conservative in his ways and ideas,
whose life disproved the ancient taunt that Presbyterianism is no
religion for a gentleman.

Simone Gallimard, publisher; born December 5, 1917, died October 22,
1995
SIMONE Gallimard, a giant in French publishing, died of cancer on
Monday in a hospital outside Paris, according to Mercure de France, the
publishing house she headed for 33 years. She was 77.
She was the mother of Antoine Gallimard, the head of Editions
Gallimard, the prestigious publishing house founded earlier this century
by Mme Gallimard's father-in-law, Gaston Gallimard.
Mme Gallimard became interested in publishing with her marriage to
Claude Gallimard in 1939, and worked in the shadows for years. In 1962,
she was instrumental in reviving the flagging Mercure de France, the
once-influential house that published poet Guillaume Apollinaire in the
early 1900s.
Mme Gallimard was caught up in one of the nation's most bizarre
publishing scandals -- the Ajar-Gary affair. In 1975, prize-winning
novelist Romain Gary earned a second Goncourt prize, under the pseudonym
Emile Ajar, for La Vie Devant Soi. Gary presented the book as the work
of his nephew, Ajar, whom he described as too shy to give interviews.
Mme Gallimard consistently denied knowledge of the author's true
identity, though Gary admitted his authorship.
The book, which was translated into 23 languages and sold 1.3 million
copies, was later adapted to the screen as Madame Rosa, starring Simone
Signoret playing an aging prostitute.
Mme Gallimard was responsible for publishing the work of Pierre Jean
Jouve, Yves Bonnefoy, Andre du Bouchet, and Henri Michaux. Invitations
to her dinner parties were highly coveted. The evenings included an
obligatory tour of the the artist Delacroix's studio which she owned.
Though she was a charming hostess there was often -- said one Parisian
literary critic -- a piquant atmosphere.
Simone Gallimard is survived by her four children, Antoine, Francoise,
Claude, and Isabelle.

Maxene Andrews, singer. Born 1916, died October 1995 in Minneapolis
THE Andrews Sisters were arguably the greatest close harmony group of
all time, a trio whose records still sound as fresh today as they were
when first recorded and who created an instantly recognisable sound of
their own. They were imitated by countless others, but they remained
unique.
Maxene Andrews, who died aged 79 at her home in Massachusetts of a
heart attack, was the middle Andrews sister, the driving force behind
the group, and the one on whom the eye always focused. She was not the
best looking -- the sisters were not pretty, and when badly
photographed, as happened in some of their films, tended to look like
rather scrawny horses -- but she had that indefinable quality that marks
a star personality.
You had to look at her. Yet oddly she did not have a star voice. None
of the sisters alone was remarkable as a singer and their solo careers
when the group split up in the 1950s were unspectacular. It was together
that they conquered, becoming during the Second World War the GI's
equivalent of the British Tommy's Vera Lynn -- but with infinitely
better songs and loads more style and sophistication.
Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar, Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree, Rum
and Coca-Cola, Apple Blossom Time, You Don't Have to Know the Language
(pronounced languidge) to Know the Language of Love, Boogie Woogie Bugle
Boy of Company B, Oh Johnnie, Oh Johnnie and Bei Mir Bist du Schon, the
list goes on and on. They recorded some 1800 songs, appeared, often as
themselves, in 22 Hollywood films during the war years, usually in
uniform, often with Bing Crosby with whom they had a highly successful
recording partnership, and sold, it is said, 75 million records during
their long career.
The sisters, Laverne, born in 1911, Maxene in 1916, and Patty in 1920,
of a Norwegian mother and a Greek father, seem to have sung together
from childhood. They had unshakable rhythm and phrased like one,
creating the effect of improvisation even though they had learned their
orchestrations by heart and could not read music. Maxene sang the high
notes, LaVerne the low ones, and Patty came in the middle, a magical
mixture if ever there was.
Their career began in 1932 in vaudeville, apparently at Maxene's
instigation, and they went on to sing with some of the big bands,
including Leon Belasco's. It was while they were working with him in
1937 that their recording of the old Yiddish ballad, Bei Mir Bist du
Schon, turned them into stars who dominated the juke boxes of America.
Their songs may have been harmonious, but the sisters fought off
stage, and after the war they gradually retired from show business. The
music scene was changing and they were not getting along. Television
gave them a new lease of life, but after LaVerne died in 1967 the end
had arrived -- or so it seemed. She proved irreplaceable.
In 1973 Bette Midler recorded Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, had a hit, and
the Andrews were back in fashion. That led to Maxene and Patti appearing
on Broadway in a nostalgic revue, Over There, which ran for a year, but
proved the final curtain. The sisters fell out, and never sang together
again.
Maxene, however, continued to perform, spending the last 20 years of
her life lecturing, singing in concerts and nightclubs, and latterly
appearing in musicals. Earlier this year she had toured in a revival of
Follies.
Her marriage to Lou Levy, who managed the group and by whom she had a
son and a daughter, ended in divorce in 1951.

Professor Sir Robert Grieve, planner and first chairman of the
Highlands and Islands Development Board; born December 11, 1910, died
October 25, 1995
PROFESSOR Sir Robert (Bob) Grieve, who died yesterday aged 84, was one
of the most influential Scots of his generation. While his career
encompassed some of the most important jobs Scotland had to offer, Bob
Grieve considered himself a civil servant in a very literal sense of the
term.
His ambition was more about giving the utmost to the current job than
longer-term personal goals. Indeed, with characteristic irony, he
reflected on his extraordinary, and extraordinarily successful, career
as a process of ''falling up the ladder''.
Born in 1910 in Maryhill, Glasgow, he had for his most fundamental
early influence his mother Catherine. She was fastidious in her care of
both her family and their overcrowded tenement home, well read,
radically socialist in her beliefs -- she was one of the Glasgow women
trusted by John McLean to feed him during his imprisonment -- and Roman
Catholic.
Recognising Bob's intelligence and potential she took him out of the
local Roman Catholic school and enrolled him in the non-sectarian
alternative, North Kelvinside. In this she was, as Bob would recall,
making a great sacrifice as she knew that while it was the best thing
for the boy, he would inevitably drift away from the religion which was
precious to her.
Grieve trained at the Glasgow Royal College of Science and Technology
(now the University of Strathclyde) and qualified as a civil engineer.
During the 1930s he worked in various local government posts, but also
endured periods of unemployment when he would, quite literally, take to
the hills, nurturing a passion for walking and climbing.
In this field, just as in every area of his career, he achieved
substantial success. He was subsequently to become the president of both
the Scottish Mountaineering Council and the Scottish Mountaineering
Club.
It was his postgraduate training as a planner, in the early days of
that discipline, which was to determine the course of the rest of his
life. That and his marriage to Mary Blackburn, who would always be known
as May. Their relationship was one of mutual adoration from the outset.
Bob Grieve's first major piece of work as a planner was on Sir Patrick
Abercrombie's team for the Clyde Valley Regional Plan, which was
published in 1946. Abercrombie, the greatest planner of his day, was
much in demand throughout the UK and therefore delegated substantial
areas of the work to Bob Grieve and his cohorts. The two years leading
up to the publication of the plan were immensely demanding and
inspiring.
The regional plan was a fundamentally important document which would
have a major influence on the evolution of the city of Glasgow. In the
years which followed its production, Bob Grieve occupied a number of
Civil Service posts, concluding in 1960 as chief planner at the Scottish
Office, where he was to remain until 1964.
During this time he influenced the planning of Scotland's new towns
and major aspects of road transport in the central belt.
In 1964 he was invited to become the first Professor of Planning at
the University of Glasgow, and just a year later, the first chairman of
the Highlands and Islands Development Board. This latter invitation was
to give him the most important role of his career, and he did not take
on the task lightly.
Indeed, the request that he become chairman led to a substantial
crisis of confidence. He would later recall spending a vexatious evening
in London, knowing that his response to the invitation was required the
following morning. He telephoned May to seek her advice which was
delivered with characteristic pragmatism: ''Bob -- you've got to do it
-- or they'll get somebody worse!''
It is much to May Grieve's credit and Scotland's benefit that he took
her advice. While at the outset one newspaper announced his arrival as
chairman with the headline ''Grieve for Scotland'' his success in the
post was to prepare the way for much of immense benefit to the country
that he loved.
The five years of his chairmanship were the most demanding of Bob
Grieve's life. Issues of land ownership, transport infrastructure,
industry and tourism had to be addressed, differences reconciled,
conflicts quelled and major decisions, which would affect all aspects of
the Highland economy and the welfare of its folk, had to be made.
On departing from the HIDB Bob Grieve returned to the chair of
planning in Glasgow where he continued to apply his skill as an
inspirational teacher until his retiral in 1974.
Retiral in no way signalled a stop to Bob Grieve's work for Scotland.
Indeed, his interests and roles continued to affect the Scottish built
and rural environments.
He chaired the Highlands and Islands Development Consultative Council
from 1970 to 1986, while simultaneously chairing the Royal Fine Art
Commission for Scotland.
His presidencies of the Scottish Countryside and Rangers Association,
the Scottish Rights of Way Society, the New Glasgow Society, the
Inverness Civic Trust, the Saltire Society, Friends of Loch Lomond and
numerous mountaineering organisations, were all undertaken with great
care and energy.
Similarly, his early involvement with the Scottish Constitutional
Convention (where he served as chairman in the production of the Claim
of Right for Scotland), in a major housing study for Glasgow and in
numerous architectural competitions and awards received his customary
care and decisiveness.
He was always able to make the most difficult decisions through a
careful balancing of all the considerations and conditioned by his
powerful feeling for ordinary folk, their needs, drives and aspirations.
The death of May Grieve in 1984 after a long illness caused Bob the
most profound anguish.
In his Who's Who entry, Bob Grieve listed his recreations as
mountaineering and poetry. The breadth of his reading and his ability to
recall substantial passages was always impressive, but never intended to
impress.
Like many of his generation, he recalled the early influence of Wells
and Jack London; he had read the great philosophers but unlike most he
could also quote from Robert Pirzig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance, his copy of which, scrawled with annotations, had been read
and re-read.
Bob Grieve's ability as a storyteller is legendary. His mastery of the
nuances of language and his ability to deliver excruciatingly funny
material with a totally deadpan expression made him much beloved as an
after-dinner raconteur.
His many aphorisms tell a great deal about his personality. He would
refer to the careful and deliberate process of thought about complex
matters as ''unscrewing the inscrutable''. His life was characterised by
achievement rather than talking, in his own words he preferred to
''exchange the unexceptional sentiment for the terror of action''.

William Russell praises a caustic comedy about the price of fame, but
a ghost story, a romp through childhood agonies, and an action sequel
fail to impress
SUZANNE Stone, the heroine of Gus Van Sant's sparkling comedy, To Die
For, confides to a girlfriend: ''In America you are nobody unless you
are on TV, because what's the point of doing anything worthwhile if
nobody's watching.''
Any Oprah show, let alone the coverage of the O J Simpson trial, would
seem proof of that particular pudding.
Suzanne (Nicole Kidman) is a pretty, plastic blonde living in Little
Hope, New England whose ambition is to become a famous television
personality. She will stop at nothing to achieve it, although on
graduating from junior college, she gets married. Since Larry Maretto,
her choice of husband, is played by Matt Dillon maybe she is not all
that daft, but it is a sideways move she has no intention of allowing to
endure.
Larry, a nice Italian boy, who helps run the family restaurant, is
enthralled by his Barbie doll wife and believes in her dreams of TV
stardom. But marriage transforms him from an idle Latin lover, who plays
drums in a rock band, into a hard-working man whose ambition is to have
a nice home, a family and an obliging little wife who will look after
both. Having got wife and home he now demands the family. Suzanne,
however, thinks otherwise.
Having finally acquired a job as the weather girl on the Little Hope's
cable TV station she believes her career is underway at last. But Larry
is getting broodier by the minute and something must be done.
That something turns out to be murder. Van Sant tells her story in a
series of flashbacks as Suzanne, brilliantly played by Kidman revealing
a hitherto unsuspected talent for comedy, reminisces to a video camera
following her trial for murder. Her running narrative is interspersed
with chat show interviews with her family and Larry's family, police
interviews with the teenagers she befriended and who carried out Larry's
murder, and the devastating views of her sister-in-law, Angela, being
interviewed by a reporter.
The resulting mosaic pins down the society of Little Hope and the
lifestyles of the Stone and Maretto families, their friends and
neighbours, and television-besotted middle America in general, with
almost surgical delicacy.
There is a moment, which Kidman rises to perfectly, when we realise
that Suzanne is no longer obsessed about her career, she is barking mad.
Van Sant, aided by a first-class script by Buck Henry, has created a
devastating picture of the Me-TV generation, and while the film does not
sustain its momentum throughout it is a marvellously mordant piece.
Kidman provides the strong central performance needed to hold it
together, although she does not get it all her own way.
Matt Dillon is impressive as the decent, hapless Larry, while Maria
Tucci as the ice-skater sister, Angela, who spotted Suzanne for what she
was straight away, gives a performance to relish, all acid and bile.
The veteran British director, Lewis Gilbert, has come up with Haunted,
a handsomely photographed ghost story based on a novel by James Herbert,
which unfortunately fails eventually to deliver in spite of all the
ingredients being right. The trouble is that there are rules for ghost
stories and this one breaks them. There are things ghosts can do and
things they cannot. And by mixing two lots of ghosts, one of whom has no
territorial reason for being there, ghosts being always linked to places
rather than people, the tale gets into a dreadful muddle.
The other problem is that the hero, a Cambridge ghost-busting
professor who does not believe in things that go bump in the night,
never asks the woman who has sought his help why she did so, although he
gets plenty of opportunity. Had he done so there would have been no
story, but that is beside the point, there should at least have been
something to stop him from asking.
Professor Ash (Aidan Quinn) is haunted by the memory of the accidental
death by drowning of his twin sister some 20 years before. Invited to
visit a stately pile in Sussex by a Miss Webb (Anna Massey), who claims
she is being persecuted by ghosts, he accepts and is met at the station
by a beautiful flapper driving a fast sports car, Christina Mariell
(Kate Beckinsale), the daughter of the house.
She lives with her brothers, aristocratic Robert (Anthony Andrews),
who is found by Ash painting her in the nude, louche Simon (Alex Lowe),
and Miss Webb, their old nanny. The siblings are not what they seem, the
least of their problems being incest, and when things go bump in the
night, John Gielgud, their GP, comes to call.
There are too many loose ends, and a couple of unintentionally
hilarious moments -- Miss Webb's horrified cry of ''Oh, no! Not you,''
when Dr Gielgud comes to call is memorably awful, as is Liz Smith's
cameo appearance as a gypsy fortune teller. The film does, however, look
good, the cast play a straight bat, and it makes a refreshing change
from pretentious tosh like The Neon Bible.
Directed by Terence Davies, The Neon Bible was booed at Cannes, much
to his chagrin, and he subsequently insisted it was the only kind of
film he can make and it wasn't fair of the audience. Maybe he is a
limited film-maker, but that should not stop him trying to extend the
boundaries of his miniature world and this is what he has failed to do.
Stylishly photographed, nicely acted, it is another romp through the
agonies of the Davies childhood -- abusive father, suffering mother,
resiliant female relatives and wounded small boy learning about life.
The sole difference from it predecessors, Still Lives and The Long Day
Closes, being that it is set in the Southern Bible Belt of the United
States, not Liverpool.
Gena Rowlands, the inevitable aunt with a past, a blues singer called
Mae, is moving and Jacob Tierney good as David (the Terence surrogate),
but it is too slow, too repetitive and ultimately too tedious.
In Under Siege 2 Stevan Seagal returns to the role of Casey Ryback,
the mild-mannered navy cook with muscles, he created in the first film.
The plot involves the usual megalomaniac who has taken over a train
carrying a computer controlling a US satellite which can destroy the
world. Why he has chosen a train rather than a submarine or an aeroplane
or just the cellar of a house is anybody's guess, but it allows Seagal
to romp over and under the carriages as he bumps off the various hired
guns in fine style.
The hero kills more people than the villains, which seems morally
suspect, but no matter. It is a brain dead movie for zombies acted by
robots.

* ALL cases for attention by The Herald Foundation Clinic for Women at
Glasgow's Royal Infirmary must be referred by general practitioners and,
while the majority will come from Glasgow and Strathclyde, patients with
gynaecological and related problems, from other parts of the country
will not be discouraged. The aim is not to screen women because that
service is already available, but to develop the kind of hi-tech
treatment facility which avoids calling a woman back repeatedly to
different venues and often to different doctors.
In the past year thousands of readers have generously raised more than
#60,000 either from individual or community donations. Ceilidhs have
been held along with church fetes, fashion shows, and fun-runs, and
various women's groups, like the Soroptimists, have pledged support. One
city employer has agreed to match any sum raised by the women on the
staff. Other contributions have come via company dances, public dinners,
and drug companies.
The Coffee Break chain among readers all over the country raised a
grand total of #25,000 and other projects -- like the Christmas stamps
collection organised with Royal Mail, the Night at the King's Theatre,
Glasgow with London City Ballet, and Hamilton Racecourse Ladies' Night
-- raised close on #5000.
On loan to the clinic's walls there are pictures by some of Scotland's
notable artists, which have been gathered together by The Herald's art
critic, Clare Henry. Among them is a watercolour of Iona, specially
painted for the opening today by Ann Smith, sister of the late John
Smith, the former Labour leader.
All this unstinting activity represents the type of collective effort
which is so vital to the foundation's work, and the Royal Infirmary
joins with us in expressing immense thanks to every single participant.

After a year of fund-raising, The Herald initiative for women's health
is up and running. Anne Simpson outlines the strategy behind the drive
for a new clinic which will be officially opened at the Royal Infirmary,
Glasgow tomorrow
IT DOES not go away, this worry that the old art of healing is being
forced into decline. As market forces continue to mock the real meaning
of caring, suspicions increase that some day soon the messy
complications of ill health will have no place in our public hospitals
at all.
Patients who cannot be mended and released within those hours imposed
by bureaucratic strategies may well be regarded as time-wasting
failures, a new class of welfare scrounger damaging the nation's
equilibrium and profit.
Whether justified or not, such anxiety is palpable throughout the
country, and it does no-one's confidence or wellbeing any good. In fact
it very often implants such negative feelings in people that when their
health does require attention they don't even bother to seek medical
advice until the symptoms prove oppressive.
Men are notoriously guilty of this, and women less so, but because
women's nurturing of others, young and old, demands so much energy and
time, many still put their physical and mental worries to one side,
locking them up within themselves and learning that risky, patient craft
of denial and disguise.
Partly as a result of this, Scottish health statistics for women are
shocking. More women here die of lung cancer than anywhere else in the
world, and in a 10-year international study which monitored heart
disease in 22 countries, women in the north of Glasgow fared worst among
15 million people.
What can be done? Obviously poverty plus a genetic and social
inheritance derived from generations of a heavy industry culture
continue to ambush health in this part of the world. But right through
society there is a pressing need to increase consciousness about the
importance of women's health and the urgency of providing the best
possible speedy treatment and care when problems do arise.
This is not to imply men's own health is less important, but because
of a woman's pivotal role within the family a small universe collapses
when illness deals the multi-job carrier a serious blow.
Preventative vigilance is the obvious strategy and to this end we
launched The Herald Foundation for Women's Health exactly one year ago,
its aim being to increase health awareness throughout Scotland and to
establish, as an initial project, a secondary investigative treatment
clinic for gynaecological and related disorders, based at the Royal
Infirmary, Glasgow.
Thanks to the impressive generosity of Herald readers and friends of
the foundation, this venture is now up and running and will be opened
officially tomorrow by Baroness of Smith of Gilmorehill.
Employing the latest technology for investigation, diagnosis and
treatment, the service is consultant-led and provides the ability to
exclude malignant disease as a causal factor. By streamlining facilities
so that a patient's treatment can be conducted by the same medical team
in one location -- preferably in a single visit -- the clinic is
designed to demonstrate that care of the highest order can and should be
offered in a manner shaped by a woman's needs, not just by the
organisational demands of the hospital itself.
Among the first purchased pieces of advanced technology are a Toshiba
ultrasound machine which cost #35,000, and a video endoscopy device
manufactured by Litechnica and costing around #8000. Apart from
achieving far greater accuracy, safety, and more detailed information
about the patient, this also allows a woman to observe the inside of her
own uterus on a television monitor while further gynaecological
examinations are carried out.
''It's an absolutely fantastic machine,'' says Helen McEwan, senior
consultant gynaecologist at the Royal. ''The most sophisticated of its
kind, enabling staff to detect problems and respond to them with much
greater speed and efficiency.''
The target sum required for the clinic is #100,000 and, at this stage,
we are well over the halfway mark, but if each woman reader of The
Herald alone were to donate just #1 we would be well clear of that
financial goal.
Of course, over the past 10 years surgical and other medical
procedures have made an enormous difference to women's lives, but the
really good doctor knows that the worth of superlative machines is
diminished for people if expertise is applied without perceptive concern
and a true understanding of a patient's fears.
With this in mind The Herald clinic aims to be a centre of excellence
staffed by attentive and experienced personnel who will counsel and ease
women's apprehension about this particularly sensitive area of medicine.
The friendly, attractive ambience of the clinic owes much to their
dedication, and to the imagination of Drew Plunkett, head of interior
design at Glasgow School of Art.
The versatility of his creative skills has completely transformed a
fifth-floor corner of the Royal's old, institutional bleakness into an
oasis of calm colours and interesting modernity.
So, apart from dispensing expert treatment and care, the clinic's aim
all round is to help lessen the dread which people often feel inside a
hospital. And although our charity foundation is principally about
women's welfare, it is also about Scotland's state of health, for it is
up to every single one of us to try and avert the anguish behind those
unacceptable statistics.

THE controversial Child Support Agency came under renewed attack last
night after a report revealed nearly a quarter of assessments for
maintenance payments were wrong.
Labour and child support groups immediately seized on the report by
the Government's chief child support officer, Mr Ernie Hazlewood, which
showed that only 29% of all assessments were both correct and made by
staff following proper procedures.
But the Government and the CSA defended the agency's work, saying
improvements had been made since the period the study was undertaken,
which ended in March.
Staff were said in the report, published yesterday, to have made
errors in 23% of cases -- either sending out demands for too little or
too much.
And in almost three in 10 further cases (28%), a lack of evidence
meant it was not possible to tell whether the maintenance assessment had
been correctly decided.
The report, a further blow to the already beleaguered agency, also
revealed that in 15% of cases, although assessments were found to be for
the right amount, staff did not follow guidelines.
The report shows only a 4% increase in accuracy of assessments from
the figure of 25% reported last year.

Buenos Aires
ARGENTINE veterans of the 1982 Falklands War said they planned to
stage peaceful blockades and boycotts to protest a South Atlantic oil
deal between Argentina and Britain.
''We don't agree with the oil deal because the blood of our fallen
comrades cannot be bought off with oil,'' said the head of the Veterans'
Federation, Victor Meneces.
The federation said it would heed a call by the nationalist Friends of
the Argentine Seas group for ''peaceful blockades in areas of the South
Atlantic where there are ships operating under British oil exploration
licences, and in ports where they wish to take on supplies''.
''In principle this would be in our own country's ports,'' said
Meneces. The veterans also want to boycott ''firms linked with British
capital operating in Argentina''.
More than 1000 servicemen died in the battle for the Falklands, most
of them Argentine. Argentina still lays claim to the islands, which it
calls the Malvinas, and President Carlos Menem regularly vows to recover
them by 2000.
Last month, however, Buenos Aires signed a deal which allows both
Britain and Argentina to charge royalties for oil exploration without
compromising their sovereignty claims.
The Argentine Government says the deal is the best way of one day
recovering the islands ''usurped'' by Britain in 1833.
The veterans' statement said they supported Menem's efforts to win

their inflexible position''. This calls for a tougher stance, they

THE captain of a Greenpeace ship accused French commandos of vandalism
yesterday after his vessel was attacked with teargas grenades and fire
hoses.
Captain Dave Enever, skipper of Altair, an 850-ton Dutch-registered
ship, said thousands of gallons of water were poured into his ship and
tins of paint were thrown about before the French troops slammed the
vessel into reverse, making it hole itself as it rammed into a
breakwater.
The attack, at Brindisi in southern Italy, happened when activists
tried to stop the French destroyer Dupleix from leaving the harbour.
Captain Enever, from Frinton, Essex, said: ''I couldn't believe that
in an Italian port, another member of the EU could do something like
that.
''They threw teargas grenades, smashed windows, and poured tons of
water down the funnel and into the engine room.''
The Altair arrived in Brindisi at 7am yesterday to make a protest
against the presence of the nuclear-capable French ship as part of the
continuing campaign against French nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Activists using rubber boats had gone alongside the French destroyer
and painted ''Stop Nuclear Tests'' on her hull.
In Bonn, eight Greenpeace activists hung a protest banner against the
French tests from a Rhine River bridge as French President Jacques
Chirac arrived to visit Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Before Mr Chirac arrived, MPs from government and opposition parties
criticised the French nuclear tests in a parliamentary debate. However
the Foreign Ministry said the German Government would not heed
opposition calls for an EU court case against France.
* Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac reaffirmed after their meeting
that their countries would qualify on schedule to join Europe's planned
economic and monetary union (EMU) in 1999.
Both said their countries would be ready to fulfil the necessary
criteria and that they were in full accord about a single currency.

Montreal
FIVE days from a vote that could split Canada in two, Prime Minister
Jean Chretien said they faced a national crisis and pleaded with Quebec
not to destroy the country by voting to separate in a referendum.
With polls showing the separatists narrowly ahead before Monday's
vote, Chretien roused a flag-waving crowd last night at the biggest
federalist rally of the campaign.
Before an estimated 8000 impassioned federalists, Chretien said he was
proud to be both a Canadian and a Quebecker. ''Canada may not be
perfect,'' he said, ''but it is a country worth fighting for, worth
doing the impossible to preserve.''
He repeated his plea on national television tonight, the first time he
has used a federal law allowing him to make an emergency TV speech. ''My
friends, we are facing a decisive moment in the history of our country.
Once again, our country is facing a crisis. And crisis and uncertainty
exact a very heavy cost. We all pay a high price for political
instability,'' Chretien said, his voice cracking with emotion.
He went on: ''I say to my fellow Quebeckers, don't let anyone diminish
or take away what we have accomplished. Don't let anyone tell you that
you cannot be a proud Quebecker and a proud Canadian within Canada.''
In-fighting has racked the federalist side for several days as its
leaders argued over whether to make a last-minute offer of
constitutional reform that would recognise Quebec as a distinct,
French-speaking society. About 82% of Quebeckers are French-speaking.
Chretien, who reworked his schedule this week to concentrate on the
referendum, took a compromise approach in his earlier speech. He made no
specific offer but suggested that Quebeckers could win the kind of
constitutional changes they want if they rejected separation.
''No means is excluded in assuring the change and modernisation of
Canada,'' Chretien said.
Lucien Bouchard, one of the top separatist leaders, scoffed at this.
''I don't believe anything he says about change,'' he said. ''He is the
symbol of the absence of change.''
A separatist victory would not trigger immediate independence for
Quebec, but that would be the eventual result. The separatists have
offered to negotiate with Canada for up to a year on a new economic and
political partnership, but with the option of unilaterally declaring
independence at any point if they felt Canada was not co-operating.
Financial traders, alarmed by polls showing the separatists ahead,
sent the Canadian dollar and the Toronto Stock Market plunging on
Monday. The markets stabilised yesterday, but the Bank of Canada raised
its bank rate by nearly 1%, the largest jump in three years.
In Montreal, hundreds of people have swamped passport offices to
obtain Canadian passports before the referendum. Federalists warn that
Quebeckers could lose their passports if Quebec -- home to one-quarter
of Canada's 25 million people -- secedes.
Warren Allmand, a Montreal resident who serves in Parliament for the
federalist Liberal Party, said his office was receiving many phone calls
from worried constituents. ''People are upset. They're panicking,'' said
Allmand. ''They wish we could do something -- something magical.''
In the isolated northern half of Quebec, turn-out was heavy as Cree
Indians voted in their own referendum yesterday to demonstrate their
opposition to separation. About 7000 of Quebec's 12,000 Cree were
eligible to vote.
First results indicated the vast majority had voted that Cree land,
roughly one-third of Quebec's territory, should remain in Canada if
Quebec declares independence.--Ap/Reuter

Madrid, Wednesday
SPANISH Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez suffered his worst blow in 13
years in power today when Parliament threw the 1996 budget back in his
face over charges he knew of a ''dirty war'' against Basque guerrillas.
Financial markets barely blinked at the widely discounted vote in
Parliament, seen on both sides as tantamount to a vote of no-confidence.
Economy Minister Pedro Solbes, asked what would happen next, replied:
''I don't know.''
Gonzalez put a brave face on the unprecedented defeat, saying he would
see through Spain's term as EU president until December and would not
bring forward an election he has already been forced to promise for
March, a year ahead of schedule.
''It always hurts more when it is the first time,'' the Socialist
leader told reporters with a smile. ''Oh well, you have to know how to
win and you have to know how to lose.''
Technically, Spain will now survive on the financial front by rolling
over the 1995 budget into next year.
Solbes said, however, that he feared the budget defeat could affect
Spain's goals towards joining European economic and monetary union.
The opposition, united across left-right divides in the vote against
the budget, joined in a chorus of demands for the immediate resignation
of Gonzalez and his Socialist government.
''The Prime Minister has a political obligation to dissolve
Parliament,'' said opposition leader Jose Maria Aznar of the
centre-right Popular Party. ''The circumstances that justified his
appointment (in 1993) have been cancelled.''
Neither his party nor the rest of the opposition, however, gave any
sign of being prepared to follow up the humiliation inflicted on
Gonzalez today with a proper censure motion.
Gonzalez has been under increasing pressure from his foes over the
illegal campaign of bombings, kidnappings, and murders against suspected
Basque Eta (Basque Homeland and Freedom) separatists that killed 27
people in the 1980s.
He denies having known about the campaign or having authorised it,
despite testimony from former intelligence chiefs, security forces
personnel, and disaffected Socialist leaders which the Supreme Court is
now considering.
Aznar's Popular Party is widely expected to win the March election by
a comfortable margin, but Gonzalez remains Spain's most popular
politician in opinion polls.--Reuter.

Washington
IT WAS a grand American wedding, so the story goes, with 300 guests
sitting down to a lavish lunch after the ceremony. The best man rose to
propose the health of the happy couple, but was interrupted by the
groom.
''Thank you all for coming,'' said he. ''I thank my bride's parents
for paying for this lavish gathering, and I am now leaving. If you will
look under your plates, you will discover why.''
He then departed, and the wedding guests opened the envelopes they
found, which contained very clear and very graphic photographs of the
bride and the best man in, as they say, flagrant delight.
It's a splendid story, is doing the rounds (it's even on the Internet)
-- and it never happened. The Washington Post devoted part of its front
page today to trying to track it down.
They found many people who had heard it from a friend who had a friend
who was at the party. Or they heard it on the radio. It was in New
Hampshire, or up-state New York, or New Jersey. A reporter dutifully
chased down the leads, which all petered out.
A local college was alleged to have started the rumour to discover how
fast word of mouth travels. Not so: the professor of catering and hotel
services denied it, and pointed out the absolute impossibility of the
story (who put the pictures under the plates, for instance?)
Other stories have been devoutly believed: the one about tourists in
New York kidnapped off the street, waking in a dingy hotel room minus a
kidney, stolen for a transplant; or the one about the health inspector
finding tinned cat food in an Asian restaurant (I have heard that in
Glasgow, Cambridge, London, and Paris).
A food manufacturer had to change its century-old logo because of a
rumour that it showed the devil. Great numbers of American blacks
believe that the Aids epidemic was started by the government to reduce
the black population. There is a whole library of books describing a
flying saucer the Air Force supposedly recovered in 1947, which has been
hiding in Warehouse 7 in a western air base ever since.
And there is the bottomless paranoia of the far right in America,
which believes that Washington has sold out to the New World Order or
the UN, and is about to stage a coup and take away their guns.
Those are serious matters, and lead to violence and hatred of
government. The wedding story is less serious. It falls into the
category of things that are too good to be true and are therefore worth
repeating. Did you hear the one about the woman who took the bus to the
Royal Infirmary with a urine sample in a whisky bottle, and had it
stolen?

Jenin, West Bank
PALESTINIAN police arrived today to take over Jenin, raising their
rifles in triumph at the beginning of the end of Israel's 28-year
occupation of West Bank cities.
Hundreds of cheering Palestinians greeted the five police officers and
their PLO escorts, who pulled up to a new Israeli-PLO liaison office on
the outskirts of Jenin at midday.
''Abu Ammar -- continue the march of liberation, we are following
you'' the crowd chanted, invoking the nom de guerre of PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat.
The officers' arrival marked what Israel said was the start of its
troop redeployment in the West Bank after the signing last month in
Washington of a deal expanding self-rule beyond the Gaza Strip and
Jericho enclave.
Arafat, in a Washington TV interview, predicted an independent
Palestinian state within two years.
Jenin, in the northern West Bank, is to be the first city handed over
to Palestinian self-rule under the September 28 accord. Israel will also
transfer civilian authority and limited security responsibility in some
450 villages to the PLO.
In the southern West Bank about 30 Jewish settlers brought three
mobile homes to a barren hilltop near the Palestinian village of
al-Khader to protest against the spread of self-rule.
The hill was the same one from which Israeli troops dragged settlers
several times during the summer. Soldiers came today but took no action.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel aimed to complete
the pull-out from the cities of Bethlehem, Jenin, Nablus, Qalqilia,
Ramallah, and Tulkarm by January 1 ahead of Palestinian elections.
The army plans to leave parts of Hebron by March, but will remain in
some sectors of the city to protect 400 Jewish settlers. Israel handed
over Gaza and Jericho 17 months ago.
Accompanied by Brigadier-General Ziad al-Atrash, head of the
Palestinian side of the Israel-PLO Security Liaison Committee, the five
policemen -- all liaison officers -- drove to the Jenin area from
Jericho in a jeep convoy.
Holding their AK-47 assault rifles high, they strode to their new duty
station, mobile homes that will serve as liaison offices just outside
Jenin city.
Arab women ululated. Israeli police tried to hold back the crowd.
Three young men fired pistols in the air in celebration.
Hours earlier in Jenin, hundreds of Palestinians chanting ''Israel no,
PLO yes'' took to the streets outside an Israeli police station where
equipment was being loaded on to flatbed trucks.
An Israeli army officer, scanning the crowd waving Palestinian flags,
noted drily that Israeli troops would remain in the city until
mid-November and said: ''It looks as if they have liberated Palestine,
but nothing is changing for them.''
Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of Israel's hard-line opposition Likud
party, decried the handover to the former guerrilla chief, telling
Israel Radio: ''They murder from Gaza and we cannot enter Gaza. Now they
will murder from Jenin.''
About 1000 Palestinian policemen will be deployed in the Jenin
district, home to nearly 200,000 Palestinians.
In another development relating to the Middle East peace process
today, world powers rejected a plea by Israel to follow yesterday's vote
by the US Congress to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Arab countries condemned the Bill, with a Lebanese official describing
it as ''repulsive'' and Syria saying it could tarnish Washington's image
as honest broker in peace moves.
Palestinian Authority Secretary General Tayeb Abdel-Rahim said: ''We
believe those in Congress who voted for the resolution were trying to
destroy the peace process the same as some Palestinian and Israeli
hard-liners are doing.''
The Bill, sponsored by Senator Bob Dole, the leading Republican
contender for President Clinton's job in next year's elections, would
move the embassy to Jerusalem by May 1999.
A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain had no plans to do the same.
Israel regards Jerusalem, including the Arab half occupied in the 1967
Middle East war, as its eternal capital, while the PLO views East
Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
* Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi today suspended the expulsion of
thousands of Palestinians for up to six months.
In August he ordered 30,000 Palestinians to leave for self-ruled areas
in order to expose the shortcomings of what he calls the sham peace
between Israel and the PLO.
Today, however, he said he would give the world six months to return
all Palestinian refugees to their homeland.
Arafat, who was in Cairo, welcomed the move as a positive
step.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
TWO helicopter pilots whose actions saved the lives of their 16
passengers when their aircraft was struck by lightning during a North
Sea flight were last night honoured with a major international safety
award.
Bristow Helicopters captains Cedric Roberts and Lionel Sole each
received the Offshore Safety Award at a surprise ceremony at a dinner
held during the Leith International Conference on offshore search and
rescue and marine and aviation safety.
The two pilots were said to have displayed ''exceptional skill and
judgment in achieving a safe and authoritative ditching after tail rotor
failure.''
The pilots were en route from Aberdeen to the Brae Field in January
when, as they flew through cloud at 3000ft, there was a flash followed
by vibration and a change in the sound of the rotors.
They sent out a Mayday giving the helicopter's position and started to
descend while trying to reach the platform. Mr Sole, 39, a bachelor, was
at the controls and Captain ''Ced'' Roberts was in command.
After about three and a half minutes, the helicopter lost the use of
its tail rotor. It was starting to spin when they decided to shut down
the two engines and allowed the machine to ''autorotate'' -- the
helicopter equivalent of gliding -- on to the sea in just 30 seconds.
Fast rescue craft from the Grampian Freedom and St Patrick stand-by
boats picked up the pilots and passengers.
Captain Roberts, 44, said: ''I think it is a fairly natural press
reaction that you either have to have a villain or a hero. If the
helicopter had gone into the water upside down, we would have been
villains. It went in the right way up and we are heroes.''

THE effectiveness of offshore survival courses could be improved by
teaching trainees how to cope with pre-course stress, a major safety
conference heard yesterday.
Ms Rachel Harris, training officer at RGIT Ltd of Aberdeen, one of the
world's leading survival training centres, revealed that course
participants were stressed even before they enrolled, sometimes because
they had been given exaggerated accounts of what would happen on the
course.
Ms Harris told the Leith International Conference in Aberdeen that
RGIT Ltd had done a three-year study on trainee responses to offshore
survival training to assess psychological and physiological stress
experienced. It was jointly funded by RGIT, the offshore safety division
of the Health and Safety Executive, and British Gas.
The influence of age and experience were also investigated to
determine whether these factors had any effect on responses.
''Evidence was found that most trainees were especially anxious at the
start of the course,'' she said. ''Reducing what appeared to be
pre-course apprehensions would therefore seem appropriate.''
She also said that those participants who were less anxious before the
course believed they coped better. ''In other words those who were more
relaxed gained more in terms of building confidence during the
training.''
The research gave the general impression that smokers were likely to
experience more anxiety and cope less effectively with offshore survival
that non-smokers. Those who did not regard themselves as physically fit
were also more anxious.
Non-swimmers also showed higher anxiety levels before the course.
''This was not entirely surprising given the amount of water-based
activities and the subjects' lack of previous experience and therefore
susceptibility to exaggerated accounts of the course content,'' she
said.
One of the suggestions for helping reduce anxiety was the availability
of water confidence classes.
She also suggested trainees be given a video or fact sheet to outline
the contents of the course to eliminate anxiety caused by unrealistic
expectations of what was ahead of them.
It had to be remembered that the purpose of the training was to
prepare offshore workers for emergencies. ''The training should
therefore reduce stress responses during the actual event, consequently
reducing the negative effects such stress could have on performance in
an emergency,'' she said.
One group of free-fall trainees had actually been given a one-hour
instructional course on how to deal with anxiety or the effects of
stress on the day before free-fall drops.
It included an introduction to what stress and stress responses were
and instruction on controlling breathing techniques and how to use
positive self-statements as well as information on what to expect during
the training.
''In this study no differences in anxiety scores were detected between
the group who received the training and a control group.
''Those with the stress training did, however, demonstrate greater
acceptance of the free-fall concept.
''This may be especially important for safety training as it could aid
trainees in developing positive response-outcome-expectances, which in
turn increase an individual's abilities in an emergency situation.''

A CHINESE mayor has been so impressed with Glasgow architecture that
he has asked the city council's architecture department to design him a
civic building in traditional Scottish style.
Whether the Chinese skyline will be graced with a baronial castle, a
tenement or even something which conjures up the memories of Glasgow's
housing schemes is as yet unclear. The council department says it will
co-operate with the private sector before submitting a final design to
Mayor Bo Xilai, mayor of Dalian on China's north-east coast.
Dalian is one of the cities booming at present in China due to the
rapid influx of foreign trade which is allowed there.
An agreement of intent to co-operate on the building was signed
yesterday at Glasgow's City Chambers at the end of a two-day trades
mission to the city by more than 70 Chinese business leaders, who met
representatives of more than 150 Scottish companies.
Glasgow was chosen because of the strong ties it has built up with
Dalian since they agreed to become twin cities in the late eighties.
Mayor Bo has also agreed to establish a European office in Glasgow to
promote trade links.

MRS Gill Faldo yesterday publicly denied she had been offered a #7.5m
divorce settlement by her husband, three-times Open golf champion Nick
Faldo.
In an announcement made through her lawyers, Mrs Faldo called for
privacy following the news of the end of her 10-year marriage.
The statement said: ''Solicitors Mishcon de Reya and their client, Mrs
Gill Faldo, are very concerned by inaccurate reports carried in the
media over the last few days which suggest that she has been offered a
divorce settlement by her husband, Nick Faldo.
''Both Mishcon de Reya and Mrs Faldo would like it to be known that no
offer has been made or the subject even discussed to date.
''Mrs Faldo is anxious that private matters concerning her marriage
should be dealt with privately.
''She requests that whoever has been disseminating misinformation to
the media should cease to do so and that she and her family be given
privacy at this distressing time.''
Nick Faldo, 38, who has been linked with 20-year-old American
university student Brenna Cepelak, announced on Monday he had separated
from his wife.
His manager, John Simpson, said yesterday the Faldos had agreed on a
separation but were not getting divorced.
He said none of the golfer's contracts would be affected.

SCOTLAND's prison population is still unacceptably high despite a drop
in numbers, a criminal justice charity said yesterday.
Sacro said the prison population can not be justified by the levels of
crime in Scotland and repeated its call for jails to be reserved mainly
for those from whom society needs protection and less for remand
prisoners.
The figures, released by the Scottish Office yesterday, show that the
average daily prison population in Scotland decreased from 5637 in 1993
to 5585 in 1994.
However, the drop masks a significant increase in numbers during 1994
when the population rose by 8% in the fourth quarter of last year.
Mr John McNeill chief executive of Sacro, yesterday described the
figures as ''disturbing'' and said they reinforced the argument for
making greater use of community penalties for non-violent offenders.
''Sixty per cent of remand prisoners are likely to be judged innocent
or given non-custodial sentences. Why hold them in custody in the first
place?''
''Sacro believes that prison should be reserved primarily for those
from whom society needs physical protection.''
The figures also showed that Glasgow's Barlinnie prison had the
highest average daily population at 1118. This was followed by Edinburgh
(646) and Glenochil (504).

THREE judges yesterday upheld an appeal by Social Security Secretary
Peter Lilley in a test case which could have cost the Government
millions of pounds from social fund loans.
They overruled an earlier decision by Lord Abernethy that the
Secretary of State had acted unlawfully in deducting cash from income
support paid to Miss Rena Mulvey, of Roystonhill, Glasgow, after she was
made bankrupt.
Last night Miss Mulvey's lawyer, Mr Derek Livingston, said they were
very disappointed at the decision and were considering an appeal to the
House of Lords.
Lord Abernethy's ruling, in November last year, opened the door to the
repayment of money which the DSS had deducted in other similar cases,
and one estimate was that thousands of people in Scotland and England
could be affected.
Mr Lilley appealed against that decision to Lord Hope, the Lord
President, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and Clyde at the Court of
Session.
Lord Hope said Miss Mulvey had been entitled to income support for
some time. Her estate was sequestrated under the Bankruptcy (Scotland)
Act 1985 with effect from February 3, 1993.
Since then the DSS had deducted from her income support sums paid to
her in loans from the social fund which had been made before her
bankruptcy. The loans totalled #517.
Miss Mulvey, who claimed that #7 a week was being deducted from her
benefits, asked the Court of Session to declare that the DSS was not
entitled to deduct from income support payable after the date of her
sequestration any amount from the social fund loans paid before that
date and still outstanding.
Lord Abernethy pronounced an order to that effect, saying that Mr
Lilley had acted beyond his powers.
Lord Hope said Miss Mulvey's argument was based upon the general rule
in bankruptcy law that a creditor was not entitled to retain from the
bankrupt after the date of sequestration sums in compensation for money
due by the bankrupt before the date of sequestration.
The point for the appeal court was whether the DSS was entitled in
terms of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to recover Miss
Mulvey's pre-sequestration loans by deducting money from her
post-sequestration income support or whether it must submit a claim for
them to her trustee in bankruptcy as an ordinary creditor.
Lord Hope said that the provisions of the bankruptcy legislation took
effect only at the stage of payment of the benefit when the net amount
payable was treated as income received by her.
He added: ''The Secretary of State for Social Security has not been
seeking to attach the income in the hands of Miss Mulvey. What he has
been doing is making the deductions which are authorised by the Social
Security Administration Act before the income support is paid out to
her.
''This is something which he is empowered to do in a question with
Miss Mulvey as the person entitled to income support, in order to obtain
repayment of awards from the social fund which were paid on condition
that they were to be repayable.
''I do not think that what he has been doing can properly be described
as obtaining an unfair preference to the prejudice of the general body
of creditors, as was suggested by Lord Abernethy.''
Lord Hope said it would be contrary to the provisions of the Social
Security Administration Act if repayable awards made out of the social
fund were to cease to be repayable in full so as to enable the trustee
to obtain a benefit for the general body of the bankrupt's creditors.
Lords Allanbridge and Clyde agreed to allow the appeal and dismiss
Miss Mulvey's case.
Miss Mulvey said later that she was disappointed that the court had
upheld Mr Lilley's appeal.
Miss Mulvey, 31, who was not in court, said she had got into financial
difficulties after her common-law husband died three years ago leaving
her to bring up three children on her own.
She said: ''I felt as if my world had collapsed. We had outstanding
cheques, catalogue bills and money to pay back to the social fund.''
Miss Mulvey said she had sought the help of a Social Work money
adviser who said she should declare herself bankrupt.
She said she had paid back the loans but had hoped that the court
would deny the appeal. ''I was hoping they would have eventually given
me the money back.
''I think the decision is both wrong and unfair. There are a lot of
other people who will suffer now and the hardest hit will be the poorest
people who cannot afford it.''
Mr David Thomas, legal adviser to the Child Poverty Action Group, said
it was also very disappointed with the ruling which affected ''a very
poor and vulnerable section of the community''.
He said: ''It unjustifiably puts the Social Security Secretary in a
superior position to other creditors when someone is bankrupt. I would
anticipate that Miss Mulvey's lawyers will appeal the case to the House
of Lords.''
A spokesman for Citizens Advice Scotland said the decision deprived
those on state benefit of a fresh start after being made bankrupt
because they would still have to pay off an old debt.
''It also makes the DSS preferential creditors and has the implication
that social security legislation overrides other legislation.''

SCOTLAND'S most senior Independent council leader yesterday called for
constructive dialogue between Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and
local government to deal with a looming financial crisis.
Councillor Peter Peacock, vice-president of the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities (Cosla) and convener of the new Highland Council, said
Mr Forsyth's recent attacks on council appointments and staffing levels
had implied local authorities were profligate and inefficient.
In his call for practical dialogue, Mr Peacock appealed for a move
from party political points scoring.
Earlier this week the Scottish Secretary promised to publish league
tables showing how much councils were spending on ''jobs for the boys''
and administration.
But Mr Peacock said: ''I think events will show that councils are
trying to make savings where they can in their management structures.''
Relations between Mr Forsyth and council leaders have deteriorated in
the past few months with Mr Forsyth criticising financial management on
the new authorities.
Yet, speaking at a press briefing in Edinburgh yesterday, Mr Peacock
said he was prepared to put aside all the ''silly rhetoric and cheap
jibes'' from the Government provided the Scottish Office entered a
proper dialogue with council leaders.
With the Budget only a month away, leaders of the new councils are
anxious to highlight the financial problems they face in their first
year. Yesterday Mr Peacock said the 1996-97 finance settlement would be
''the most difficult ever in the history of local government''.

FORMER Scotland United supporter John McAllion is to take on the job
of presenting Labour's devolution proposals in the Shadow Scottish team.
The Dundee East MP, one of the keenest devolvers in the party's ranks,
has been given a special brief by Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson to promote the Constitutional Convention's scheme for a
Scottish parliament.
Mr Robertson, who remains in overall charge of constitutional policy,
said he also had asked Mr McAllion to ''co-ordinate rebuttal of Tory and
SNP lies and disinformation.''
The new member of the team, Mrs Helen Liddell, MP for Monklands East,
is to work on a special project to draw up key priorities for a
Labour-run Scottish Office during the first 100 days of government.
A former head of the Scottish TUC's economics department and chief
executive of the Business Venture Programme 1993-94, she will work with
Mr Robertson's deputy, Mr John McFall, MP for Dumbarton, in shaping
policies for business and industry and continue their work on the Jobs
Task Force established earlier this year to prepare a strategy for job
creation, skills and training.
Mr Robertson said: ''This is a formidable team to prepare for taking
power.
The combination of talent on the Front Bench reflects Labour's
seriousness in setting the agenda for the next Government. We are more
than ready to take over in St Andrew's House when the present lame duck
tenants dare to face the voters.
The detailed responsiblities are:
Mr Robertson -- overall responsibility, Europe, constitution.
Mr McFall -- industry and economic affairs, employment and training,
home affairs, transport and roads, Highlands and Islands.
Mr McAllion -- local government, housing, constitutional affairs,
health and community care, sport, rural affairs.
Mrs Liddell -- education, social work, arts and heritage, tourism,
industry and economic affairs, agriculture, forestry, fishing,
environment, machinery of government.

A GOVERNMENT Minister yesterday said a good word about devolution.
This would have been a sensational event had not the hoped-for
devolution been in EAST TIMOR, half a small island which, sleepily
colonised by the Portuguese for a couple of centuries, was recolonised
by Indonesia in 1976.
The Foreign Office, along with many other Chancellories of the world,
protests regularly about this to the Indonesians but do not actually do
anything about either the 20-year occupation or the brutalities
committed against the Timorese population, who either would have liked
to be independent or even continued rubbing along with the Portuguese.
We Scots, who vividly remember the Edwardian occupation and the more
recent ''rough wooing'' of Henry VIII, should understand how the
Timorese feel, although the Indonesian government has at its disposal
weapons of repression not available to the Earls of Surrey and Hertford.
Mr Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North -- Lab.), the Commons answer to Che
Guevara, wearing a beard and the air of a man who has just returned from
a guerrilla campaign, has remorselessly championed the Timorese cause
and he again called for action.
He and Mrs Ann Clywd (Cynon Valley -- Lab.) suggested that Britain
might be doing worse than nothing. Mrs Clywd, alleged that we are
financing the training of police used to suppress revolt, financing an
immigration project to swamp the Timorese with Indonesians and paying
for a shortwave transmitter to assist Indonesian propaganda.
Mr Corbyn suggested that some of the large quantity of arms Britain
exports to Indonesia certainly could be used to suppress internal
revolts.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, given the opportunity of recuperative world travel
after the agony of being Conservative Party chairman, denied that any of
our exported arms could be used for repression, with about as much
conviction as his earlier claims that the Tories were not bitterly
divided over Europe.
The independent National Audit Office is now examining our exports to
Indonesia, and Labours expect another Pergau Dam to be revealed.
Mr Nichols Winterton (Macclesfield -- Con.), announcing himself as an
officer of the all-party British Indonesian parliamentary group,
admitted there had been ''abuse and atrocities'' in East Timor but said
these must be balanced against our trade, political and cultural
connections with Indonesia going back several hundred years. Then again,
he said, ''the very constructive contact the British Government has is
very beneficial to the people of East Timor''.
It will doubtless comfort the Timorese victims of ''abuse and
atrocities'' to reflect, if they are able to reflect, that did their
persecutors not enjoy good contacts with the British Government things
might be even worse.
A general air of listlessness hung over Foreign Office Questions which
ranged around the current world troublespots without indicating that
much could be done about them.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, who, like his predecessor,
gives the impression of enjoying diplomacy for diplomacy's sake, at one
stage declared: ''The present division of Cyprus is unacceptable.''
''You said that 10 years ago,'' muttered a weary voice.
Were Britain still a great power Mr Rifkind's shadow, Mr Robin Cook,
would make, we will not say a better, but a more interesting Foreign
Secretary than Mr Rifkind.
Mr Cook is capable of being dimplomatic, but getting things done would
seem higher on his temperamental agenda than on those of the mandarins
he may one day rule, for whom conflict and disruption are the things to
be avoided at almost all costs -- a reason they were scorned by Mrs
Thatcher. Watching Mr Cook at the Foreign office, if that is where he
goes, should be extremely interesting.
Watching Mr Hanley there answering questions with the same hesitant
air he wore when confronted with another rotten opinion poll was
painful.
Asked a straightforward question by Mr Norman Hogg (Cumbernauld and
Kilsyth -- Lab.) about which PLO leaders he would be meeting and where,
he answered that Mr Hogg had mistakenly described him as an
Under-Secretary when he was in fact a grander Minister of State.
Several Labour MPs, though not polite Mr Hogg, grimaced at this class
consciousness. However, Mr Hanley's warmth and humour came to his aid as
he wryly added: ''But noting the direction of my recent career, it may
just be a matter of time.'' Charm may not be enough, but that, at least,
the Foreign office often has.

TWO men who broke into a mausoleum, damaged headstones and scattered
an urn of ashes were yesterday sent to jail under an ancient Scots Law
charge.
Robert Ryan, 29, and Norman Doran, 25, pleaded guilty at Kilmarnock
Sheriff Court to violating the sepulchre of a woman whose ashes had been
placed in the mausoleum in 1981.
The court heard that police had been alerted to an incident at the
mausoleum in Loudoun Kirk, Galston, on the evening of October 2.
When they arrived they had to scale a 10ftgate to the mausoleum where
they discovered the two accused. A headstone dating from 1633 had been
broken and a plaque lay smashed on the ground.
Procurator-fiscal depute Debbie Carroll said an urn containing the
ashes of Frances Young, widow of the late Colonel Young, had been
removed and the ashes scattered.
Miss Carroll told the court the mausoleum belonged to the Campbells of
Loudoun Castle and some of the graves were dated before the Union of the
Crowns.
Defence agent Des Morris said he could offer no explanation regarding
the incident and that the men were pleading guilty to the charge. The
Crown accepted Ryan's plea of not guilty to the charge of assaulting a
police officer.
Sheriff Terence Russell sentenced Ryan, of Seright Square, Kilmarnock
and Doran, of Morris Crescent, Hurlford, to the maximum three months'
imprisonment.
Mrs Madeline Kerr, daughter of the late Lady Jane Campbell and a
trustee of the Loudon Estates, was in court to hear the sentence being
passed.
She said she welcomed the fact the men had been jailed.

A FIVE-month campaign by the Lews Castle School board of management to
retain the Stornoway secondary school -- without any integration with
the neighbouring Nicolson Institute -- has succeeded.
Western Isles Council decided by 23 votes to one to back the retention
of the school in its Gibson Buildings with required alterations.
The education committee considered three options including keeping the
school within its present accommodation, integration with the Nicolson
Institute but with retention of its own curriculum or integration of
both schools under a unified management structure.
Councillor Donald Macleod, a former chairman of the education
committee, moved that the two options for change be deleted and that
they seek consultation with the parents only on the continuation of the
Lews Castle School in its present premises. This was carried
overwhelmingly.
After the meeting the Rev Tom Sinclair, chairman of the Lews Castle
School board, said: ''I am pretty sure that the parents, along with the
school board, will be delighted at the outcome of the decision taken by
the council.
'' During our campaign we put forward very cogent arguments that the
school should remain in its present premises with some improvements.
''However, I feel we should not congratulate ourselves that we have
won until we see the school established in its own right and continuing
to serve the community as it has done in the past.'

A TRANSPORT watchdog will host a public meeting in Kyle of Lochalsh
tomorrow afternoon to hear local views of the withdrawal of the Skye
ferry and, unexpectedly, the new #23m Skye toll bridge.
The willingness of the Caledonian MacBrayne User's Consultative
Committee, part of the statutory Railway Users Consultative Committee
for Scotland, to consider the bridge and its tolls was welcomed by Ross,
Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy as a courageous move.
It was also well received by local anti-bridge campaigners who earlier
had been angered by the RUCCS's failure to pursue its statutory right to
call a public inquiry into the ferry's withdrawal, and were not placated
by the original announcement of tomorrow's ''informal'' meeting.
Following the meeting the committee will prepare a report for the
Secretary of State with recommendations on how to alleviate any hardship
caused by the withdrawal of the ferry service.
However in a pre-meeting statement the committee stressed that it: ''.
. . did not have the power to insist that the ferry service remained in
operation until this meeting was held, nor . . . to insist on the
reinstatement of the ferry service.''
However, it then goes on to raise issues for discussion, such as:
* Whether there should be tolls on the bridge at all;
* Level of tolls;
* Monopoly situation of the bridge company;
* The lack of a body to represent bridge users.
Last night Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal
Group, said: ''We had been very disappointed that the RUCCS had not
called a public inquiry into ferry withdrawal given it was crystal clear
the Government was turning somersaults on the matter, making up the
legal position as it went along.
''That has been a serious failure on the committee's part but
obviously we now welcome its willingness to consider representations on
the question of tolls and the bridge's monopoly position.
''These issues are absolutely vital. We had been led to believe that
the meeting would just be going through the motions on the ferry
withdrawal, but the appeal group has committed itself to carrying on the
campaign against the tolls, so we will be there on Friday.''
Mrs MacRae said the group would also be making the case in support of
the Skye Boat Company running a car ferry service in direct competition
to the bridge.
MP Charles Kennedy added: ''I know that the committee has come in for
some criticism for holding this meeting after the bridge's opening and
the ferry's withdrawal, but in my dealings with committee members I have
been genuinely impressed by their forthright approach and their
sensitivity to local opinion. Their move to consider representations on
the bridge underlines that.
''I am confident that what will emerge from this meeting will be a set
of public recommendations that are highly embarrassing to Michael
Forsyth. Not at all the sort of thing the Scottish Office was expecting
from this committee, regardless of what they say.''
A Scottish Office spokesman commented: ''The committee is well within
its rights to examine such issues on the basis of representations made
to it. The Secretary of State and the Scottish Office will read its
report with interest.''
RUCCS secretary Mr Bill Ure was unavailable for comment yesterday.

<HEADLINE>MPs want two-minute silence restored</HEADLINE>

MPs FROM across the political spectrum have called for the restoration
of the traditional two-minute silence on Armistice Day.
Veteran disability campaigner Alf Morris (Manchester Wythenshawe) has
tabled an early-day motion in the Commons supporting the call for a
nationwide two-minute silence on Saturday November 11 at 11am.
It is part of the Royal British Legion's campaign to restore the
silence -- on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.
Mr Morris has been supported in his move by MPs from the Conservative,
Labour, Liberal Democrat, Scottish and Welsh Nationalist and Ulster
Unionist parties.
The silence marks the signing of the Armistice in the First World War.
It was first observed in 1920 and continued every year until 1938.
It was suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War.
After the war, the Remembrance Ceremony was moved to a Sunday in
November. Now the Legion wants to restore the silence to its traditional
time.
The Legion's 11-11-11 Campaign follows the success two-minute silence
to mark VE Day in May this year.
Legion Chaplain Bishop Michael Mann said: ''The religious and racial
diversity of those who paused in May, and who we hope will stand in
silence on November 11, will match the many races and religions of those
who fought for freedom in the Second World War, those who have done so
since, and the mix of the population today.''
Legion National President Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Dalton said: ''We
have tacit support from many commercial organisations and it is our
intention to ask all those retail outlets and other places where people
are busy to signal to their customers and workers the beginning and end
of the two-minute silence.
''We believe and hope that tills will stop and work places will fall
silent.''
Mr David France, the Legion's campaign co-ordinator, said he expected
Downing Street to issue a statement supporting the silence as it did
before the VE Day remembrance.

A SENIOR Tory MP yesterday demanded that public spending in Scotland
should be brought down to the English average.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the influential Conservative Back Bench
Finance Committee, repeated the call made this summer by the right-wing
92 Group of Tory MPs.
Then, Mr Michael Forsyth, Scottish Secretary, said in an exclusive
interview with The Herald, that their aims would be carried out ''over
my dead body.''
In a wide ranging speech, Mr Townend, MP for Bridlington, called for a
#7bn package of tax cuts in next month's Budget with more next year,
paid for pound-for-pound by reductions in public spending. This is the
biggest tax cut package so far suggested.
He warned: ''The witching hour approaches. Unless this Budget fulfils
the aspirations of Tory supporters in the country and middle England, we
shall not win the election.''
Some English Tory MPs believe that public spending in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland is too high, even allowing for the special
circumstances of Northern Ireland.
They challenge the claim by successive Scottish Secretaries that
Scotland receives the share of public spending that it needs and argue
that Scotland, now one of the best- performing economic regions of the
UK, does not require such help.

SENIOR officials from the nuclear industry yesterday gave assurances
to MPs about the safety of the industry after privatisation and over
decommissioning costs.
Amid growing concerns that the planned privatisation programme is
fraught with danger, both Dr Robert Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear
Electric, and Dr Robin Jeffrey, chairman and chief executive of Scottish
Nuclear, emphasised that safety was the top priority.
In evidence to the Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee, Dr
Hawley said: ''Our track record (on safety) is extremely good in the
last five years and we are regulated extremely fiercely, so there is
never any possibility of commercial interests overtaking safety.
''The whole of our ethos is safety, and on the commercial side if we
were not safe we would not have a commercial business.''
Dr Jeffrey said: ''If you look at Scottish Nuclear, over the last five
years we have reduced the cost of manufacturing a unit of electricity by
one third and we have increased productivity by 48%. If you look at any
measurement of safety in the company over those five years, it has
steadily improved year on year.
''The commercial pressures we face in the future will be no different
to what we have faced in the last five years.''
On decommissioning costs, which have been a key concern for possible
investors in the privatised nuclear companies, Dr Jeffrey said there
would be a ''segregated fund'' of money set aside, effectively to act as
an insurance against decommissioning.
During the 30 to 40 years of operation of a power station, money would
be set aside in a totally separate fund -- which neither the Government
nor the industry could touch -- to set against the cost of closing the
station down.
Both the fund and the technology available to decommission a power
station would be regularly reviewed -- the plan is to do this every five
years -- and Dr Jeffrey claimed that on the basis of recent
decommissioning studies the cost estimates had begun to reduce.
The chairman-designate of British Energy, Mr John Robb, was challenged
by MPs on whether there would be any further building of new power
stations, but he told them: ''I would not rule it out and I would not
rule it in. No decision has been arrived at, and nor should it be until
we are further down the track.''
The executives gave guarantees that Scottish Nuclear would retain a
degree of autonomy under the new arrangements, protected through the
rules governing the company's structure and special share arrangements.
In addition, Scottish Nuclear would continue to sell all of its output
from Hunterston B and Torness up to the year 2005 under the existing
contract sales arrangements.

SCOTLAND'S rivers have been invaded by an army of American freshwater
lobsters and scientists fear that the illegal immigrants could wreak
havoc on fish stocks and upset the natural balance of river life.
One specimen of the American signal crayfish, which can grow to up to
10ins, has been captured alive by scientists. Others have been sighted
and some have been caught by shocked anglers.
The crustacean can travel across dry land and scavenges on vegetation
and fish eggs laid on river bottoms. Scientists fear that, if the alien
crayfish multiply, they could have a devastating effect on salmon and
trout stocks.
The signal crayfish have been found in the Tay river system in
Perthshire and there is concern about their impact on some of the
Scotland's most expensive salmon fishing.
Last month a surprised angler hooked a 10in American crayfish in the
River Earn near Crieff and scientists at the Tay River Purification
Board in Perth have a five-inch specimen that was found at a fish farm
near Comrie.
The crayfish first entered British waters when they escaped from
English fish farms and wiped out native crayfish populations by
spreading disease. Steps are now being taken to ban the introduction of
the mini-lobsters into waters where they are not already established.
Tay River Purification Board biologist Brian Clelland said: ''We are
concerned about the appearance of this alien species. A growing
population of them could pose a very serious threat to our native
fauna.''
He added: ''Our best hope is that the Scottish water will not suit
this species. They need a lot of calcium in the water to keep the
strength in their shell, and not many Scottish rivers have this.''
The scientists have nicknamed their unwelcome visitor ''Reggie Cray''
and have already found him a troublesome customer. He escaped from his
tank in the Perth laboratory and was only recaptured after hours of
frantic searching.

NEW grants to help develop the talents of young people were signalled
last night by National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley as she
launched a fierce defence of the National Lottery.
Shadow National Heritage Secretary Jack Cunningham proposed a Talent
Fund created from lottery proceeds -- for people such as athletes,
artists, scientists, designers, musicians and inventors.
In a Labour-initiated Commons debate on the lottery, Mrs Bottomley
responded by likening this to initiatives she would be announcing on
Monday using lottery cash through the Millennium Commission.
This involved ''an award scheme so we invest in the next generation as
we move towards the next millennium,'' she told MPs.
Officials later confirmed that on Monday Mrs Bottomley would be
announcing a consultation paper on the Millennium Award Scheme, possibly
involving millions of pounds for awards. The aim was to develop
individual potential for the benefit of the community across a range of
activities including sport, the arts and sciences.
In the debate, Mrs Bottomley rejected church leaders' criticism that
the lottery threatened a gambling epidemic.
In her defence of the operation of the lottery, Mrs Bottomley
described it as a British success story and said that ''much nonsense
has been put about.''
On claims that the poor play more than the rich, she said: ''Around 30
million people play the National Lottery every week -- three out of four
households. Some people have complained about this, saying that we are
encouraging people to spend money they cannot afford on the lottery.
''Independent evidence from the Family Expenditure Survey shows that
on average each household spends #2.10p a week, with the wealthiest
income groups spending more.''
On claims that jackpot prizes were too big, she claimed that it was
rare for one person to win the whole jackpot prize, and that out of 280
jackpot wins, only 18 had been for more than #5m.
The Minister denied that Camelot's profits were excessive compared
with other lottery operations in Europe, but a key part of her remarks
concerned the claims that the regions of Britain were missing out at the
expense of London-based organisations such as Sadler's Wells and the
Royal Opera House at Covent Garden.
She said: ''We are monitoring the regional spread of awards and the
distributing bodies recognise the need to reach all corners of the
country. They can and will encourage applications from any region which
is not receiving a good share.''
Dr Cunningham said that Labour in office would ensure that when a new
contract to operate the lottery was due, it would be on a not-for-profit
basis, thus releasing many more millions for the arts, sport, heritage
and charities alike.
He said there had been ministerial promises from the outset that
lottery funding would be additional to Government public spending
programmes, and would not be used to help fund them.
The Labour spokesman pledged that under a Labour Government there
would be a Lottery Consumers' Council to safeguard people's interests.
He said: ''We propose it simply because people want to get involved. It
would have a variety of duties -- scrutiny, information to the public
and guidance to the public about what is going on.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr David Alton claimed: ''The lottery
builds up an element of hysteria and frenzy, with prizes as massive as
#17m. People don't look at the odds against winning, so vast numbers of
people pay massive amounts of money.
''It's targeted at people in the poorer areas. They think that somehow
they will get out of their situations.''
He said the British Medical Journal had reported a 17% increase in
calls to Gamblers Anonymous since the lottery began.
Labour MP John Maxton (Glasgow Cathcart), voicing reservations about
the size of ''rollover'' prizes, urged: ''We ought to take that #9m or
#10m and simply give it to the Charities Board for allocation to the
charities.
''It is something which I think would be immensely popular with the
people of this country and would solve the objections that many people
have to the very large rollover prizes.''
Winding up for Labour, Dr Lewis Moonie conceded that the lottery had
been a success.
However, he said: ''The Government may well have been taken for a ride
by the lottery operators. That certainly would not surprise me at all.
They should in turn recognise the profit level is higher than a fair
return on the risk that has been taken -- effectively nil -- and
certainly on the capital deployed.''
Replying for the Government, National Heritage Minister of State Iain
Sproat defended the decision not to cap jackpots, insisting: ''The whole
point of the jackpot not being capped is that if there is a rollover,
more people buy tickets and that means that there is more money
available for the good causes.''
Turning to criticisms of the lottery by the churches, Mr Sproat said:
''It does seem to me to be a very odd thing to do, to say that the
lottery is something that should never have happened and is damaging
society, and then take money from the lottery.''
The Church of Scotland had said it did not like gambling and was
refusing to take lottery money, he added. ''That seems to me the
honourable situation.''
Labour's motion calling for a Lottery Consumers' Council and a fairer
distribution of funds was defeated by 302 votes to 264, a Government
majority of 38.

TONY BLAIR and the Labour Party emerged as winners from the party
conference season, with a new Mori poll showing that Labour has taken an
even bigger lead -- of 29% -- over the Conservatives, following the
conferences.
The figures, in the Times today, are: Labour 56% (51% at the end of
September), Conservatives 27% (28%) and Liberal Democrats 13% (16%).
The result will be a disappointment to the Prime Minister, who hoped
that his conference would see a relaunch of Tory fortunes.
Unless the Government can retrieve the position in the year ahead, the
Conservatives face a drubbing at the next General Election.
LORDS Leader Viscount Cranborne, who headed Mr Major's leadership
campaign, has been awarded a bigger pay rise than any other Cabinet
member. He said last night that this was in line with a pay formula
agreed two years ago. He receives a rise of 3.3% in his parliamentary
salary -- up from #55,329 to #57,161.

A POLICE constable alleged to have offered to drop drug charges in
exchange for sex was threatened with arrest because of his reluctance to
answer questions from a senior officer, a court heard yesterday.
Constable Ian Gibson, 31, had to be warned that he could be detained
if he did not attend for a taped interview, a superintendent told the
court.
Superintendent Sid Mitchell said that he was investigating a complaint
against Mr Gibson in November last year, and asked him to come to a room
away from his office for a taped interview.
He said: ''Constable Gibson was reluctant to attend and he asked what
would happen if he declined.
''I told him he would be detained.''
Mr Gibson then agreed to attend the interview, but Superintendent
Mitchell said that he was ''reluctant to speak on tape''.
The constable had asked if he was a witness or a suspect, and Mr
Mitchell replied: ''You're a suspect.''
After a series of questions, Mr Gibson refused to comment further
until he took legal advice.
Under cross-examination by Mr Gibson's solicitor, Mr Len Murray, the
superintendent denied that the interview was like an ''interrogation''
and added: ''He was treated exactly the same way as I would treat any
other suspect.
''I was trying to be fair to him. I was giving him every opportunity
to answer the questions at that time to explain his actions.''
Miss Karen McNally, 35, earlier told Dundee Sheriff Court that a
''drunk'' Mr Gibson had come to her flat late at night and offfered to
''come to some arrangement'' over a small quantity of cannabis which had
been seized from her house four days earlier in a police raid.
She claimed that Mr Gibson made suggestions about oral sex and
handcuffs and offered her money.
Yesterday, at the conclusion of the trial, Sheriff Alexander Eccles
said that, because of the considerable evidence and that the
consequences of the case could have a ''drastic effect'' on Mr Gibson,
he would deliver his verdict next week.
After a submission that there was no case to answer, Sherrif Eccles
agreed to drop a charge alleging that, between November 10 and 16 last
year, at Tayside Police headquarters and Miss McNally's house in the
Whitfield area of the city, Mr Gibson was concerned in the supply of
cannabis.

THE committee of the troubled Ayr racecourse has again come under fire
for what one critic has called ''a bungled attempt to get off the
hook''.
A letter has been sent to the 600 members of the Western Meeting Club
which owns the racecourse telling them that an extraordinary general
meeting to discuss the financial affairs of the club has been postponed
until next month because of legal complications.
But club member Mr Tony Collins, who successfully fought for an
independent investigation into financial irregularities at the course,
strongly criticised the committee's handling of the matter and has once
again called for its members' resignation.
An EGM was called for tomorrow but it was pointed out that the proper
notice had not been given and acting chairman Mr Jake Stewart has been
forced to postpone it.
In his letter Mr Stewart said: ''Whilst the committee have the widest
possible powers of interpretation of the rules, they are concerned that
potential legal action of challenge to the validity of the meeting could
only prove more costly and disruptive to the club.
''The committee consider that, whilst such a challenge is entirely
open to any member, such actions are against the spirit of a club. We
hope that this EGM will once and for all end this continuing
confrontation and allow the committee to implement the recommendations
of Coopers and Lybrand.''
The accountants were called in last month after a shortfall of
#100,000 in the funds was discovered, and are understood to have
prepared a report for the committee.
Strathclyde Police are conducting their own inquiries into the
financial affairs of the racecourse.
Mr Collins, a Troon stockbroker, said that the committee had been
fully aware of the legal challenge, but took 12 days to inform members.
''They have deliberately failed to implement the recommendations of
the September EGM which they opposed and on which they were defeated.
They have now bungled an attempt to get off the hook which, I suspect,
was doomed before the result of the vote was known,'' he said.
After last month's EGM club chairman Major Ivan Straker resigned
declaring ''the buck stops at the top''.

FOREIGN seamen will for the second year running, man a powerful tug
intended to help ships in distress in the Minch.
The vessel will be Dutch owned and manned, a move that has angered
seamen and led to Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald accusing the
Government of snubbing local crews.
The deployment of the tugs is in line with Lord Donaldson's report
following the sinking of the Braer off Shetland.
Their main purpose is to prevent tankers and other vessels from
running aground and polluting the coastline.
But last year's experiment drew stinging criticism when it was
discovered that the tug based in Stornoway, the Brodospas Sun, was a
flag-of-convenience vessel which was Croatian owned and crewed.
This year the Minch tug is the Smit-Lloyd Safe.
Mr Macdonald said yesterday: ''It is absolutely disgraceful that the
Government is turning its back upon the local seamen who could man the
Stornoway tug.

PARENTS have been urged to be aware of their children's whereabouts
following an indecent assault on a 10-year-old boy in Milngavie, near
Glasgow, at the weekend.
The assault took place between 4.45pm and 5pm on Saturday in shrubbery
off a path running adjacent to the River Allander behind Cloberfield
industrial estate. The boy suffered no physical injuries.
His attacker, who ran off in the direction of Mugdock Road, Milngavie,
after the assault, was described as being between 30 and 40 years old
and 5ft 8ins tall.
Detective Constable Richard Irvine, of Milngavie CID, said yesterday:
''This was a very distressing incident and we are anxious to track down
the man responsible.''
DC Irvine said that he believed a register of sex offenders living
locally would help in cases such as the assault.
He was commenting on a demand by a new pressure group for a register
of sex offenders to be set up to reduce the chances of convicted rapists
and paedophiles striking again.
Action on Child Exploitation (ACHE) believes the controversial listing
may have prevented Robert Black from abducting and killing young girls.

SEVERAL schoolboys, accused of killing a nine-year-old boy by lighting
a fire in an unoccupied tenement, later had the charges against them
dropped, a fatal accident inquiry heard yesterday.
One of the boys, now 14, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told
the inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court that he had been interviewed by
police the day after nine-year-old Craig Bottley died.
While being interviewed, the youth had refused to co-operate with
police in case his pals called him a ''grass''.
His father, who was present at the interview, told him: ''Look, a wee
boy is dead so shut your mouth about being a grass.'' It was then he
mentioned the names of two other boys and was charged.
The Crown later followed a recommendation from the Reporter to the
Children's Panel that the charges be dropped, the inquiry heard.
The inquiry heard the boys climbed a drain pipe, kicked in one of the
window screens and entered a boarded-up tenement one day last October.
Furniture was thrown about, windows smashed and a sofa on the first
floor was set alight before they left.
One boy told the inquiry he had seen Craig climbing the drain pipe
into the house and warned him to come back down. Craig refused and went
into the building.
The inquiry continues.

BRITISH boxing's governing body yesterday drew up new measures to
improve safety, and appealed to fighters to take more responsibility for
their own health and fitness.
The Boxing Board of Control proposed a 12-point plan to try to avoid
the deaths and injuries which have marred the sport in the last few
years.
These included introducing compulsory magnetic resonance imaging brain
scans for all fighters every year and giving doctors a more ''hands-on''
role at the ringside.
The board's chief medical officer, Dr Adrian Whiteson, appealed
directly to fighters not to risk dehydration and serious injury.
He told a news conference: ''The boxer himself is responsible to a
certain extent for his own health and fitness. If you cheat, you're in
trouble. Boxers must be aware of the weight at which they are
comfortable, not the weight at which you look good in the ring and
collapse later.''
He added: ''The time to retire is not when you get an abnormal MRI
scan, it's when you are taking a few more punches than you should.''
He praised former world super-middleweight champion Chris Eubank for
''quitting at the top''. He added he did not in principle approve of
boxers who retired then came back two years later, and older.
The proposals recommend suspending boxers who are knocked out or
stopped for 45 days rather than the current 28, and introducing a 28-day
ban on sparring for a fighter stopped or knocked out.
The proposals draw on the studies of an independent working party,
headed by neurologist Peter Richards, set up after the death of boxer
Bradley Stone 18 months ago.
The findings were due for release last week but were delayed by the
death of Scot James Murray in a British bantamweight title fight in
Glasgow.
Dr Richards confirmed that the working party had considered reducing
the number of rounds in a contest, though it was not among the
recommendations.
He said: ''There's no doubt if you look at the fights where injuries
have occurred, they were at the end of hard fights between well-matched
opponents, where there's doubt who's going to win.
''We would feel it's wise to reduce the number of rounds. But we
couldn't put a figure on how many rounds is safe, other than zero of
course.''
However, he said it would have to be worldwide. ''If a British boxer
used to fighting eight has to go abroad and do 12, he's going to be at
risk in the last four.''
Promoter Frank Warren, who has offered to underwrite the cost of MRI
scans for every British boxer in the coming year, said he was ''highly
delighted'' at the new measures.
He said: ''It's important that it should be recognised that this is
not something which has been brought in just because of what happened to
James Murray: it's something that they have been working on for a
year.''
The brain checks, which are more revealing than the current CT scans,
cost around #500 each.
Murray's manager gave the reforms a cautious welcome, but said more
could still be done. Even then, said Mr Alex Morrison, boxing remained a
dangerous sport and more fatalities would happen.
Mr Morrison thought some of the measures could be stricter, such as
extending post-knockout suspensions to 60 days to discourage ''cowboy''
managers.
Brain scans should be held before every title fight, and there should
also be tighter controls on managers getting a licence. Some managers at
present were unable to look after a boxer financially.
''I know of one Scottish manager -- he was only a short time in
management -- who hitch-hiked to London with his boxer, they hung about
in London all day before the fight, his boxer was beaten and then they
got the night train home again,'' he said.
The reforms would not have prevented the death of Murray: he had a
brain scan last February, and was not due for another until February
next year.
Mr Morrison added: ''We haven't had the official report yet, but a
vein tore somewhere in the skull and blood flowed into the cavity and
put pressure on the brain. By the time he was unconscious, it would be
too late to do anything for him.''
Boxing Board general secretary John Morris said he believed the new
measures would be accepted by the sport.
They did not, however, satisfy the British Medical Association, which
wants a ban on boxing unless the head is no longer a target.
A spokeswoman said they were a step in the right direction. ''We think
the recommendations such as MRI scanning should provide a body of
research which will indicate the kind of acute, and in particular
cumulative, damage to boxers' brains, which we believe necessitates a
ban on the sport.''
The 12-point safety plan is:
* Weigh-in times to be brought forward at least 24 hours (already
happening).
* Brain scans to be compulsory for all boxers annually.
* Scans to be MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) instead of CT
(computerised tomography). Panel of doctors with expertise in clinical
neurosciences to be set up in order to have consistency in examination
and interpretation of investigations.
* Funding to be sought for research into psychometric testing.
* Random drug testing to be stepped up.
* Post-contest medical checks to be tightened.
* Suspension period for boxers knocked out or stopped extended from 28
to 45 days. No boxer stopped or knocked out to spar for 28 days.
* Any boxer knocked unconscious or who, in the view of the doctor, has
taken excessive punishment should go to hospital. Board would exercise
its right to suspend any boxer ignoring medical advice either at the
venue or at hospital.
* Ringside medical requirements were approved in general, but a
special medical panel has been chosen to assess further ringside
resuscitation equipment.
* Referee to be permitted to consult a ringside doctor during the
contest. The doctor to be permitted to draw any matter of concern to a
referee between rounds.
* Doctors and paramedics at ringside to be clearly identifiable and
seated where they can see clearly and gain immediate access to the ring.
* Doctors to enter the ring immediately at the end of all contests to
check both boxers. The ring to be kept clear of all except specially
designated people, particularly until the doctors give the all-clear.

Dangerous driving conviction is overturned after judge snores in
court.
A MOTORIST convicted of dangerous driving won his appeal yesterday
because a sheriff fell asleep during his trial.
Temporary Sheriff John T Dean was snoring and awoke only after the bar
officer made several loud banging noises, three appeal court judges were
told.
The Justiciary Appeal Court ruled that Andrew Frew's conviction must
be set aside because justice had not been seen to be done.
At Ayr Sheriff Court on August 21 this year Sheriff Dean convicted Mr
Frew, 25, of Beechwood Avenue, Auchinleck, Ayrshire, of dangerous
driving, fined him #250, banned him from driving for a year, and ordered
him to resit a driving test.
Mr Frew appealed, arguing that he had suffered a miscarriage of
justice.
Ms Margaret Scott, counsel for Mr Frew, told Lord Justice Clerk Ross,
sitting with Lords Morison and Prosser, that the basis of the appeal was
that the sheriff had fallen asleep during the trial.
''The fact that he fell asleep was noticed by all those in the court
when the sheriff started to snore,'' added Ms Scott.
There was a pause in the questioning and the bar officer attempted to
wake the sheriff by making several loud banging noises.
In his report to the appeal court, Sheriff Dean said that during the
course of the trial he had been unaware of ''anything untoward''
happening.
The sheriff also suggested that the fact that a judge had fallen
asleep during a trial ''may not be unique in judicial history''.
The Crown began by arguing that there had been no miscarriage of
justice and estimated that the sheriff had dropped off for only about 15
seconds.
Mr Donald Mackay, QC, Solicitor-General, pointed out that after the
sheriff woke up the defence lawyer had gone over the same questions that
had been asked while he was asleep and the witness gave the same
answers.
Lord Prosser said that there might have been a lapse of concentration
on the sheriff's part before he fell asleep and no-one could tell how
long that had lasted.
Lord Morison intervened to say that if there was a trial in which the
judge had fallen asleep ''that is a plain instance of justice not being
seen to be done and that is the end of the matter''.
Mr Mackay conceded that in light of the observations by the appeal
court it would not be safe to proceed on the basis that justice had been
seen to be done.
Delivering the opinion of the court, Lord Ross said it had been
explained that the trial had take place on a particularly hot day in a
courtroom that had no air-conditioning. Others in court had experienced
discomfort from the conditions.
Lord Ross added, however: ''The rules of natural justice require not
only that justice be done but that justice be seen to be done.
''We would not dispute that justice may have been done, but we are
quite satisfied that in a case where the sheriff fell asleep for
whatever reason for what is admitted to be a substantial period, justice
cannot be said to have been seen to be done.''
He pointed out that after the sheriff awoke he appeared not to realise
what stage the trial had reached and called on the fiscal to re-examine
the police witness. The fiscal had to point out that the defence
solicitor had not yet completed his questioning.
''That appears to us to confirm that this was unfortunately a case
where it must be held that justice was not seen to be done.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Courts Administration said last night:
''It would be inappropriate to comment in advance of studying the full
text of the appeal court's decision.''

A BLUNDERING thief left his home number on a farmer's answerphone
before helping to steal his caravan, a court heard yesterday .
Mark Charles, 25, of Petershill Road, Glasgow telephoned Drum Farm at
Carronbridge, Stirlingshire last November after seeing the #4500 caravan
advertised in a local paper.
A few days later he arrived with a friend and asked to see the
caravan, Stirling Sheriff Court was told.
Depute fiscal Valerie Barber-Fleming said Charles and James Carr, 41,
tried to haggle down the price of the luxury caravan with a farmworker.
The farmhand told the pair he could not negotiate as his employer was
away, but Charles and Carr pressured him into allowing them to test the
van's towing hitch by coupling it to their car.
Mrs Barber-Fleming said the farmworker felt ''so badgered'' that he
then allowed Charles and Carr to see how well the van towed by driving
off down the farm lane.
In a farcical scene, the thief's car then ground to a halt, the court
heard.
Charles and Carr then asked the farmhand for some mechanical lubricant
and managed to tow the van away while the man was gone.
They did not return, and were stopped on the motorway while hauling
the van towards Glasgow after the farmhand phoned police.
Charles, the passenger, pled guilty to the theft, and sentence was
deferred for reports.
Sheriff Robert Younger was told that Carr, of Motherwell Road,
Bellshill, had denied the charge, but had been found guilty after a
trial in July and jailed for four months.
Deferring sentence on Charles for background reports, he said: ''It's
obviously very strange to have left your name and address on an
answering machine and then gone and stole the thing, but this is still a
serious matter.''

KWIK-FIT chairman Tom Farmer yesterday told a court he was surprised
at being ''misled'' by the managing director of the firm's new motor
insurance business.
He was giving evidence at the Court of Session where Mr Raymond Connor
is seeking #50,000 against Kwik-Fit, alleging his dismissal in January
this year amounted to a breach of contract.
Mr Farmer 55, said he was initially not interested in the idea when Mr
Connor, a solicitor, approached him in 1993. However, the following
year, the parent company Kwik-Fit Holdings gave the insurance business
its full support.
''At that time we were backing Mr Connor 100%,'' said Mr Farmer.
As managing director he was asked to put in #75,000. He was allocated
5% of the equity and a share in a further 5% held by senior managers.
Kwik-Fit held 77% and its insurance broker and adviser Alexander and
Alexander the remaining stake.
By the end of 1994, the company was taking shape. It had secured #2.4m
in grants from the Scottish Office for its offices at Bellshill,
Lanarkshire, which would provide 200 jobs.
Mr Farmer said in January this year he was informed that Mr Connor had
been a director of brokers Campbell Renfield which had gone into
liquidation and he had failed to disclose this on the company's
professional indemnity insurance form.
''I felt I had been misled. I was very surprised'', Mr Farmer told the
court.
He said his advisers told him the lack of disclosure could have
serious implications for the firm, its 200 employees and the confidence
of insurance companies on which it depended.
Mr Farmer said he asked Mr Connor why he had done it.
''The tone of his reply was more or less 'I did it, thinking it could
be put right later on.' I took the decision that if he did not resign,
he would be dismissed'', said Mr Farmer.
Under cross-examination, Mr Farmer admitted he had not looked into the
circumstances surrounding Mr Connor signing the indemnity form, but as
managing director, it was his responsibility.
Mr Connor, of St Swithin's Cottage, Ninemileburn, Midlothian, is also
asking Lord Coulsfield to rule that Kwik-Fit is obliged to pay him cash
in terms of a share agreement. Kwik-Fit has raised an action against Mr
Connor for the reduction in share transactions made in his favour.
The hearing continues.

ROGUE lorry operators are flourishing in Scotland due to a 50% drop in
random road checks since 1993, risking public safety and blighting the
industry, the director of pressure group Brake told hauliers at a
national dinner in Glasgow last night.
The address, to delegates from the Scotland and Northern Ireland Road
Haulage Association, marked the first campaign link-up between the
transport safety pressure group and the industry body.
Leaders of both organisations will meet Transport Minister Steven
Norris on Monday to press for tougher penalties against unlicensed
operators.
Brake director Ms Mary Williams said: ''Roadside checks have been
decimated. It is a scandal that Scotland should have lost half its
roadside enforcement of heavy goods vehicles when the Government is
saying enforcement has not been affected by budget cuts to the Vehicle
Inspectorate.''
In 1993-94 a total of 19,141 checks were carried out in Scotland, a
figure Mr Norris last month stated would fall to 10,435 this year.
Ms Williams added: ''This is a question of economics, safety, and
image for the haulage industry. Unregulated operators risk accidents,
undercut respectable companies, and damage others' reputations.
''Brake wants to ensure that this rogue element is weeded out and that
lorry tragedies of the past are not repeated.''
RHA Scotland and Northern Ireland director Wylie Cunningham backed Ms
Williams's call, adding: ''The industry is on the whole perfectly well
run but it is being undermined by a small minority of operators running
illegally.
''It is a real comment on the Government that we have to tell it to
use its own enforcement policy more strictly.''

MOVES that might have led to Glasgow abandoning its traditional
support for boxing were rejected by city councillors yesterday, writes
Municipal Correspondent John MacCalman.
Following the death of Jim Murray, a group of councillors put down a
motion at yesterday's meeting of the district council's ruling Labour
Group seeking to establish what support the council gave to boxing and
whether such support could be justified in light of growing medical
concern.
The implication was that, after receiving the information on the
council's commitment, the council would probably find itself debating
the propriety of continuing to support boxing.
Glasgow District Council has pumped considerable sums into promotion
of world championship fights and granted the Freedom of the City to
former world lightweight boxing champion Jim Watt. It also awards grants
to various boxing clubs, and facilities are made available for
youngsters.
Labour leader Councillor Patrick Lally said figures compiled by the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents showed that the level of
deaths in most other sports was considerably higher than the level of
deaths in boxing over the past six years.
These included substantially higher death rates in mountaineering,
motor racing, athletics, and swimming.
The motion was defeated by 26 votes to 13.

MRS Winnie Ewing accused Scottish Labour Euro-MPs of voting against
Scottish banks being allowed to print their own notes within a single
European currency yesterday.
The six Scots Labour MEPs obeyed a Socialist group Whip and voted down
an amendment in the European Parliament by Mrs Ewing concerning the
design of national banknotes from various EU member states but later
claimed they did so because Mrs Ewing's amendment was ''irrelevant''.
Mrs Ewing countered that this explanation was bogus because two of the
six had voted for another SNP amendment on protecting jobs if the single
currency is adopted with British participation. British Tories
abstained.
The assembly voted to adopt a Green Paper on moves towards a single
currency. Mrs Ewing had proposed an amendment protecting the right of
member states to have their identity protected on one side of the new
paper money and to allow banks such as those in Scotland and Northern
Ireland which currently print money to continue doing so.
Mrs Ewing said: ''Disappointingly all the Scottish Labour MEPs voted
to rule out the possibility of Scottish banks printing Euro-Scottish
banknotes . . . It is absurd.''
However, Glasgow Labour MEP Bill Miller said: ''As usual, the SNP have
completely missed the point. Labour members voted on the broad approach
to a single currency for those countries participating in monetary
union.''

RELATIVES of convicted killers T C Campbell and Joseph Steele vowed
yesterday to carry on their campaign to have the case reopened.
They were speaking outside the High Court in Edinburgh after the two
men failed to persuade a judge to allow them access to documents which
they claimed would help prove their innocence.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, ruled that their application to
order the Crown Office to hand over documents relating to their case was
incompetent.
The judge said that both had already lost appeals against their
convictions and the only remaining remedy was to persuade the Scottish
Secretary to refer the case back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
The two men were jailed for life in 1984 after being convicted of the
murder of six members of the Doyle family whose house was set on fire
during what became known as the Glasgow Ice-Cream Wars.
Both presented their own cases yesterday, helped by Glasgow solicitor
Mr John Carroll, who sat behind them.
They particularly want access to documents such as witness statements
and notes of interviews conducted by Strathclyde Police and the
procurator fiscal in Glasgow, which they claim will back up their claim
that the key witness at their trial, Mr William Lovell, committed
perjury.
Campbell argued yesterday that full and proper disclosure of the
documents should be made to satisfy the ''needs and interests of
justice''.
Mr Donald Mackay, QC, Solicitor General, argued that it would not be
competent for Lord Ross to grant an order for recovery of the documents.
The avowed intention of the two men was to put themselves in a
position to present another appeal to the High Court. There had been a
trial in 1984, both men had been convicted of murder and both had their
appeals refused in June 1985.
''As yet, the Secretary of State has not exercised the powers which
are open to him to refer either or both of the cases back to the appeal
court.''
After the hearing, supporters of Campbell and Steele unfurled banners
outside the court demanding justice for both men.
Campbell's sister, Mrs Agnes Lafferty, said: ''According to the judge,
the only way we are going to get this case into court is through the
Secretary of State. We are going to have to get the public to put
pressure on him.''
Steele's brother, Johnny, commented: ''Tell the Secretary of State we
are coming.''

GOVERNMENT plans to solve the mystery of dangerous munitions being
washed up on Scots beaches were attacked last night by angry MPs who
claimed the planned survey did not go far enough.
At the same time they argued that the survey should be extended to
cover other areas and that work on a British Gas pipeline should be
suspended until the problem had been solved.
The Government announced on Tuesday that they were bringing forward
the survey of the Beaufort Dyke area in the Irish Sea. It will now be
carried out by the Marine Laboratory at Aberdeen next month with the
results expected before Christmas.
Further details of the timing and scope of the survey came yesterday
from Scottish Environment Minister Lord Lindsay, who said: ''We
appreciate the general public's concern about the canisters which have
been coming ashore and the Government has responded positively. I can
assure the public that the findings will be published.''
The survey will: * Take samples from the seabed sediment from
Beaufort's Dyke and the area between it and the Premier Transco gas
pipeline.
* Analyse samples from the charted munitions dump site to check for
any contamination from munitions dumping.
* Carry out an underwater television study to check if it is safe to
carry out a trawl.
* Then a trawl will check the dump site area and between the site and
the pipeline and catch commercial fish and shellfish to check for any
contamination from the munitions dumping.
Last night, Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon
Valley, said: ''I feel we are being conned. It has become clear to me
the problem is going to be much bigger and needs a much larger survey
using sophisticated technology such as lasers and sonar.''
Mr Foulkes has already put down a question for answer by Scots
Secretary Michael Forsyth calling for the scope of the survey to be
extended.
'' Unless it covers the whole area it will be inadequate and a waste
of time.''
He also claimed that the munitions could have been disturbed by the
plough being used by British Gas to construct the pipeline and called
for the suspension of work until the problem had been completely solved.
He added: ''Commercial interest should not be put ahead of public
safety.''
Next month Mr Foulkes will speak at two protest meetings in Dumfries
and Stranraer. He has the backing of Mr Brian Donohoe, Labour member for
Cunninghame South, and Mrs Ray Michie, the Liberal Democrat MP for
Argyll and Bute.
Mrs Michie said: ''I think it likely they could be carrying out the
survey in the wrong place and that these munitions may have been
disturbed by the gas pipeline workings.''
Mr Donohoe said: ''It would appear the MoD have no real idea where all
the dumping took place. The only sure way of solving the problem is to
carry out a survey of the whole Irish Sea.''
The Herald spotlighted the problem nine years ago when it revealed
that millions of tons of munitions had been dumped off the south-west
coast of Scotland.
At that time crewmen who had worked on board the ships charged with
dumping the dangerous cargoes admitted that to save time they had dumped
material in shallower waters before reaching the authorised dump site.

THE number of accidents involving women drivers in Scotland has risen
dramatically, according to official statistics.
The figures, issued by the Scottish Office yesterday, reveal a 92%
increase over a 10-year period in the accident rate for female motorists
in the 17-22 age range.
Even in the older age groups, there are significant rises: up 49% in
the 23-29 group, and up 38% in the 30-59 group.
The statistics compare the total accidents for last year against the
average annual figures between 1981 and 1985.
However, the rise should be seen in the context of a huge growth in
the number of female drivers in recent years.
The AA yesterday estimated that there had been a 50% increase in women
motorists: up from eight million in 1985, to 12 million this year, now
representing 40% of all drivers.
By contrast, the male accident rate was relatively stable. Over the
same period, the 17-22 age group had 4% more accidents, but there were
falls for the 23-29 group (down 17%) and for the 30-59 group (down 18%).
Last year saw the lowest documented number of deaths on Scotland's
roads, 95, about 10% less than in 1993, and 36% below the 1981-5
average.
Although the combined tally of fatal and serious accidents -- 704 --
rose by 5% on the previous year, it was 34% lower than in the early
1980s.
Scotland's fatality rate in 1994 (7.8 per 100,000 of population) was
one of the lowest of 24 developed countries surveyed, and 47% below the
EU average. Only Norway, Sweden, and England and Wales had lower rates.
However, the pedestrian fatality rate was 8% above the EU average,
although that was an improvement on 1993, when it was 24% higher.
Scottish Office Roads Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton welcomed
the broad thrust of the statistics, but said no one ''should be
complacent in any way''.
He added: ''I would urge drivers to make greater allowances for
pedestrians of all ages but especially the more vulnerable groups: young
children and the older adults.''

HOUSE prices in Aberdeen, which for some time have bucked national
trends, appear to be slipping in line with the rest of the country.
In the third quarter of this year they have fallen by 5% compared to
the same period last year, and although prices generally are falling,
the Aberdeen drop is almost four times the Scottish average and twice
the UK figure.
However, the average house price in Aberdeen remains higher than both
Scotland and the UK.
In their quarterly review, the Aberdeen Solicitors' Property Centre
and Grampian Regional Council reveal that the average selling price at
the end of September was #67,175 compared with #71,230 a year earlier.
The report also shows that between July and September there were an
average of 2961 properties for sale in the Aberdeen area which is about
50% higher than at any time last year and the highest since 1989.
In the city, there were 1307 properties on the market with 10% priced
at more than #100,000 and 16% at under #35,000.
Mr Malcolm Shepherd, ASPC vice-chairman, said:''Three years ago
Aberdeen stuck out like a sore thumb with prices rising 15%. Two years
ago, the rise had slowed to 8%, last year it was 4% and this year it
looks like prices will drop slightly.
''There is much more action and things are better at the lower end of
the market with flats and small houses but that is probably because most
of these buyers don't have anything to sell.''

A PHOTOGRAPH of smiling eight-year-old Charmaine West and the image of
her skull yesterday dominated the Rosemary West murder trial.
Superimposing the skull image on the picture, a forensic dental
surgeon said he had no doubt whatsoever that Scots-born Charmaine had
died at the most two to three months after the photograph was taken.
Her death could even have occurred immediately after the photograph
was taken, dental surgeon Dr David Whittaker told the jury at Winchester
Crown Court.
The curtains were closed in Court 3 as the forensic expert, with the
aid of a projector and a large screen explained his findings to the
court.
The jury were first of all shown the picture of Charmaine -- her two
front teeth missing.
The image came from a photograph of her and her younger sister Anne
Marie taken by a professional photographer on April 29, 1971.
The Crown alleges that when Charmaine was killed Frederick West was in
prison. The court has heard evidence he was not released until late June
of that year.
Using a pointer, Dr Whittaker highlighted distinguishing marks on
Charmaine's teeth.
He then overlaid the photograph with the image of the skull, recovered
last year from under the kitchen floor of 25 Midland Road, Gloucester.
Rosemary West pleads not guilty to the murder of 10 young girls and
women, including that of her stepdaughter Charmaine -- the daughter of
Frederick West's first wife Rena.
The remains of Rena West and her babysitter Anna McFall -- both Scots
-- were recovered from Finger Post and Letter Box fields, Kempley, 15
miles from Gloucester. Mrs West is not accused of these two murders.
Dr Whittaker described how he enlarged the photograph of a suspected
victim to the exact same scale of the skull. Superimposing the images,
he could be confident of identifying the victim.
In the case of Charmaine he had no doubt she had died within two to
three months of the photograph being taken.
Her two front teeth were still under the gum in the photograph, but
were present in the skull and, had Charmaine lived, they would have
broken through within a short space of time.
Apart from the loss of two baby teeth shown in the photograph, all
teeth were recovered from the flat at Midland Road.
The baby teeth could have been lost by natural shedding immediately
before death, he said. Alternatively, and more likely, they were lost
post mortem.
Detective Superintendent John Bennett, who led the investigation into
the deaths at 25 Cromwell Road and elsewhere, told the court that houses
where Rosemary West had stayed after her initial arrest were bugged
lawfully on the authority of his chief constable.
Asked by defending counsel Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, whether this was
to provide evidential material against Mrs West, the officer said it was
not. It was to provide intelligence to get to the truth of the matter.
Mrs West had made no admissions when the bugs were in place.
During the investigation the officer said that he had linked the
disappearance of yet another young girl to that of Lucy Partington, one
of the victims involved in the murder charge.
At the time Lucy Partington disappeared in 1973, 15-year-old Mary
Bastholm went missing from a bus stop. Nothing has been heard of her
since.
However, police had not produced any evidence to justify a charge
being made against anyone in connection with Mary's disappearance.
At the conclusion of the officer's evidence Mr Brian Leveson, QC, told
the court: ''That is the case for the Crown.''
The judge told the jury that in such a serious case he would allow the
defence two days to consider the position if it chose so to do.
Mr Ferguson indicated he would accept the offer.
The jury has been told that the trial should end within three weeks.
It could conclude sooner.
The trial continues on Monday.

AN IRAQI diplomat expelled from Britain was an intelligence agent
targeting Saddam Hussein's opponents in this country, it has been
revealed.
Diplomat Khamis Khalaf Al Ajili, administrative attache at the Iraqi
interests section of the Jordanian embassy, was ordered to leave the
country by October 31, the Foreign Office announced yesterday.
It is understood that Al Ajili was a member of Iraq's Directorate of
General Intelligence, which has been responsible for terrorist acts
around the world.
He was engaged in targeting Iraqi nationals in this country, British
sources said.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ''He has been declared persona non
grata on the grounds he has been engaged in activities incompatible with
his diplomatic status.''
The Iraqi National Congress, the umbrella organisation for the main
Iraqi opposition group based in northern Iraq, said in a statement: ''We
welcome the expulsion from the UK of one of Saddam's agents, who was
using diplomatic cover to engage in terror against the Iraqi opposition
in this country.''
Formal diplomatic relations between Britain and Iraq were severed at
the beginning of the Gulf War but there is a small Iraqi interests
section attached to the Jordanian embassy in London.
Al Ajili, who arrived in Britain in August 1994, was one of just three
Iraqi diplomatic staff based in London. Britain has no diplomats in
Baghdad.

ON the day the Prince of Wales revisited victims of the Paisley floods
amid heavy winter storms, Strathclyde Regional Council yesterday
admitted that, if the weather conditions which caused the floods were to
be recur, the same thing would happen again.
The council said it had been unable to carry out #30m prevention
measures identified by its own technical assessment following the flood
because it was prohibited from undertaking a project of such scale in
the run up to local government reorganisation in April.
A spokesman said: ''The type of weather leading up to the floods only
occur every hundred years. We have been able to improve things
considerably and are now covered for conditions which would recur every
25 years.
''However, if entirely similar circumstances recurred in Paisley,
there would be the same flooding.
''The work required would involve diverting whole river courses,
removing reservoirs and removing housing. We are talking about a massive
redraw and rethink''
He added that since the flood the council had laid new drains in the
area and set up flood-watch teams to monitor conditions made up of local
engineers and technicians, but the cost of more extensive measures had
proved prohibitive.
Sheet lightning and thunderclouds provided the backdrop to the Prince
of Wales' visit to Paisley to inspect rebuilding work and meet some of
the victims worst hit by last year's floods.
Amid wind and hailstones, with puddles lapping onto the pavement the
Prince visited Stockholm Street in the south of Paisley, where 37
families evacuated during the deluge last December are still to return
to their old houses.
As he ran for cover while thunderstorms and hailstones sent crowds of
onlookers scattering he joked: ''I hope I'll not need a rowing boat to
get out of here.''
The Prince was invited into the home of the Cairns family at 1
Stockholm Street which he visited last winter, 10 days after the
catastrophe. He watched a home video taken by Mr Andrew Cairns showing
the damage caused by water levels which rose to the first floor of the
house.
Mrs Lorraine Cairns said: ''He was marvellous. It was really good for
everyone that he kept his promise to come back to see us.''
The Prince then visited the Halvert family next door who returned to
their house on Monday after spending 10 months in temporary
accommodation.
Later the Prince met leaders of the flood vicitms' campaign group,
South End action committee. The group are to petition Scottish Secretary
Mr Michael Forsyth in Whitehall next month to support a flood prevention
Bill for Scotland which would increase precaution and compensation
levels for affected areas.
Supporting the group, Paisley South MP Gordon McMaster, who was
present to welcome the Prince in Stockholm Street said: ''There has been
a lot of complaints from the people who have been decanted from their
homes about how long it is taking for them to be rehoused.
''However their main concern is that these sort of floods should never
happen again. More money should be available for prevention measures.''
Renfrew District Council yesterday put the cost of repairing the 97
houses damaged by the floods at #2m. It said that more than half the
evacuated tenants are yet to return to their old homes, but predicted
that they would all be rehoused by December.
Earlier the Prince of Wales was reunited with a former shipmate on a
visit to a cancer unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.
Naval chief stoker, Mr James Chapman, 41, of Crossford, near
Dunfermline, Fife, served with the Prince who was appointed commander of
the minesweeper HMS Bronington, which was based at Rosyth in 1976.

''They do not understand that if too many predators get the upper
hand, especially if the habitat is wrong in some way, then the damage
could take many years to correct, and a way of country life could be
lost for ever.''
SCOTTISH landowners called on the Government yesterday to licence them
to kill or control protected species of birds of prey which they claim
are endangering grouse and other game birds.
In an impassioned plea for action to save jobs in a fragile rural
economy, the convener of the Scottish Landowners Federation, Mr Graeme
Gordon, said he realised his words would be regarded as heresy by some
sections of the public who were ''unable to accept that the countryside
has to be managed and who now regard raptors as some kind of sacred
creature.''
He declared: ''We now face a situation where the increase in the
numbers of peregrines and ospreys is hailed as a conservation miracle,
but the rapid decline in all grouse species, grey partridge, snipe,
golden plover to name just a few species, is regarded with public
indifference.''
''The urban public is now a generation or more away from having
everyday knowledge of rural life and does not, to my mind, understand
the need for man to manage the balance of nature in a managed
countryside.
''They do not understand that if too many predators get the upper
hand, especially if the habitat is wrong in some way, then the damage
could take many years to correct, and a way of country life could be
lost for ever.''
''We need a change in Government policy over the issue of culling or
control by licence so that flexibility can be brought back to nature
conservation,'' he said.
Mr Gordon said he accepted that the balance of numbers was affected by
many factors, including changing land use, agricultural practice,
airborne pollution, and pesticide and herbicide use.
Nevertheless, there was now a greatly increased impact from some types
of hawk, including some protected species, which were threatening the
existence of grouse, racing pigeons, and also hedgerow and garden birds.
Two pieces of legislation gave protection to certain species, but both
allowed for ''derogation by licence'' from their provisions, said Mr
Gordon.
''We should recognise that the keeper is the true conservator and that
he should be licensed where appropriate to achieve the aims of the 1981
Act,'' he said.
But Stuart Housden, director of the Royal Society for the Protection
of Birds in Scotland, pointed to ''deliberate, systematic and routine
persecution'' of protected birds, particularly hen harriers, by keepers
throughout Scotland.
''Illegal persecution is actually the thing that makes it very hard
for the people in cities and towns, as they cannot understand why people
who, frankly, should know better, have a callous disregard for the law.
And it is this that undermines any sympathy for the sorts of claims that
landowners and managers are making,'' he said.
Referring to figures produced by Game Conservancy Trust -- that 30% of
grouse are killed by raptors compared with 17% being shot; and that a
survey involving radio-tagged grouse and a land-search showed that
between 55% and 59% of grouse had been killed by raptors -- Mr Housden
said that was still a need for more detailed scientific research.
''It is proved that birds of prey attack and kill quite a lot of
grouse. What has not yet been established satisfactorily is whether that
affects the number that settle to breed the next year and the
productivity of these birds,'' he said.
Instead, he blamed intensive land management techniques caused by the
Common Agricultural Policy and land managers trying to squeeze their
land at both ends.
Mr Magnus Magnusson, chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage, said SNH
and other country agencies would continue to oppose all illegal acts
against birds of prey.
''We recognise that there is a need for further collaborative research
regarding relationships between birds of prey, game birds and their
habitats -- and until this research is completed, and the implications
of the results considered, we shall not support any moves to allow the
killing or taking of raptors,'' he said.

THE Chancellor was yesterday urged to cut tax on whisky by 26p a
bottle in his Budget next month.
The call came from the Scottish Council Development and Industry, the
body backed by business, unions, and local government.
Similar calls have already come, not unnaturally, from the Scotch
Whisky Association, which says that sales have dropped since Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke hastily raised the tax last December to balance the
Government's books when it was forced to drop the second stage VAT rise
on domestic fuel.
The industry argues that the rise was cancelled out by lost sales.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is said to be sympathetic to the
industry's pleas.
The Scottish Council yesterday emphasised the importance of the whisky
industry to Scotland, not only in jobs, but also in the indirect benefit
of helping to increase the perception and recognition of Scotland.
The Scottish Council also urged the Chancellor to introduce measures
aimed at creating jobs, and suggested further improvements in tax and
other benefits to counter circumstances where taking a job was
financially unattractive.
* The Chancellor was yesterday urged to make a statement to the
Commons to answer fears that the Government is intending to tax
redundancy payments in the Budget.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said up to 500,000
people could be affected by plans and that many were taking redundancy
early rather than risk being hit in next month's Budget.

A CONTROVERSIAL scheme to introduce more ''on the job'' training for
postgraduate students seeking to become secondary school teachers has
been dropped by the Government.
Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson announced yesterday that
the mentor teacher scheme -- whose introduction had already been
postponed because of widespread concern about the implications for
schools and teacher training institutions -- was being shelved.
He said it was clear from soundings he had taken since the
postponement was announced that the unions and local authorities did not
believe the time was right for the initiative.
Mr Robertson said the teachers' regulatory body, the General Teaching
Council, would set up a working group to develop teacher training
partnerships between schools and colleges of education.
Senior education sources said they hoped this would result in schools
and institutions agreeing on what they could manage within resources.
The Educational Institute of Scotland and the Scottish Secondary
Teachers' Association had both announced ballots on boycotting mentoring
schemes which were not properly funded.
EIS general secretary Ronnie Smith said last night: ''I have to
express satisfaction that the Government has seen the light since, from
the outset, the EIS has said that the scheme was fundamentally flawed.''
Professor Jim McCall, Dean of the Strathclyde University's Faculty of
Education -- the biggest teacher training institution in Scotland --
said: ''The Minister's decision clearly recognises the pressures that
exist in schools and teacher education institutions.''
The Government had planned to involve secondary school teachers acting
as mentors who would supervise the classroom training of, and assess,
students on the one-year postgraduate course.
Under the plans students would have spent 22 weeks of the course in
the classroom and 14 weeks at college.
Although the Government announced a #2m package over two years to
enable schools to buy in cover for teachers who would act as mentors,
local authorities said the scheme remained unworkable.

As part of the campaign the Health Education Board for Scotland has
published a parents' guide called The Facts of Drugs to be distributed

The campaign follows discussions with parents from a wide range of
social backgrounds.
A survey showed there was a lack of communication within families on

THE wife of footballer David Irons told a court yesterday that Partick
Thistle chairman Jim Oliver threatened to put her husband out of the
game unless he dropped a court case against the club and signed a new
contract.
Mrs Fiona Irons also said that things were made difficult at the club
for her husband and team-mate Ray Farningham after news of their court
action against Thistle became known.
The use of a club car, in which Mr Farningham had driven from Dundee,
picking up Mr Irons on his way to Glasgow every day, was withdrawn, she
said.
The players were made to take the train at different times and Mr
Irons wrote off his own car in a blizzard driving home after training on
his own. The use of the club car was restored two weeks after the
accident.
The two players are suing Partick Thistle at the Court of Session in
Edinburgh.
They claim they are owed an outstanding #5000 as part of their
signing-on fee and a further #20,000 for helping the club win promotion
to the Premier Division.
Thistle, who are contesting the action, claim that the players were
paid the ''agreed'' signing-on fee of #15,000 and #6000 in promotion
bonuses.
Mr Irons, 34, from Stirling, who now plays for St Johnstone, and Mr
Farningham, who now plays for Dundee, claim the extra money was promised
to them for the 1991-92 season after they joined Thistle from
Dunfermline in 1991.
Mrs Irons told Lord Hamilton yesterday that, when the time came for
her husband to renew his contract with Thistle two years after joining,
assistant manager Gerry Collins told her that Mr Oliver threatened to
''put David out of the game'' unless he signed a new contract.
In discussions with manager John Lambie, she and her husband were also
told that there would be no new contract unless the court action was
dropped.
In telephone calls, Mr Collins and Mr Lambie expressed concern for Mr
Irons after the crash, but Mr Collins also told Mrs Irons that he
supported John Lambie 100% in the dispute.
Mrs Irons explained to the court that her family had been excited
about the expected #20,000 bonus when Partick did win promotion.
The hearing continues.

THOUSANDS of people living in former coal-mining areas could be at
risk of catching radiation-induced cancer, a mine ventilation expert
warned yesterday.
Consultant engineer Tony Gardner said that the radioactive gas radon,
which is known to be released underground during coal-mining activity,
could be seeping up from abandoned pits.
Mr Gardner, a former Coal Board ventilation engineer who now works for
a firm of consulting engineers, realised the danger when he analysed gas
samples taken from a bore-hole connecting old mine-workings to the
surface in Yorkshire.
In a report in the Safety and Health Practitioner, the journal of the
Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, he points out that many
deep pits are connected vertically to shallower ones, from which the gas
could seep through cracks in the ground -- all it would take would be a
change in the weather.
He said yesterday: ''When a mine is being worked, radon gathers and is
ventilated into the atmosphere with other gases and is dilute enough not
to cause any harm.
''But after a pit closes, the gases will gather and reach the stage
where they might be displaced by flooding, or be forced out according to
Boyle's Law when the outside barometric pressure drops. It will do no
harm in the open air, but it could be a different matter if it seeps
into someone's house.''
Radon is thought to cause lung cancer, and possibly leukemia, and is a
recognised hazard in certain parts of the country where geological
conditions cause its release.
These include the South-west of England and the granite-rich areas of
Grampian and Highland regions, but former coal-mining areas have not
been identified as hot-spots.
Radon is the largest single source -- 41% -- of radiation absorbed by
the public in Scotland.
The National Radiological Protection Board has spent several years
carrying out sample testing of homes throughout the country.
Preliminary results do not support Mr Gardner's hypothesis; Central,
Lothian, and Strathclyde region registered levels well below the two
areas known to be at risk from natural radon.

A WOMAN was convicted yesterday of killing her four-year-old daughter.
Celia Beckett, 34, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, was found guilty of the
poisoning and manslaughter of daughter Tracey after a four-week trial at
Nottingham Crown Court.
The jury retired for the night after failing to reach a verdict on a
third charge, that Beckett had poisoned another daughter, Debbie. She
has already admitted causing cruelty to Debbie.
The court heard that Tracey had been fed a massive overdose by Beckett
of her anti-depressant tablets on September 5, 1986.
She was taken to hospital and survived, although doctors said she had
swallowed a potentially lethal dose of Amitriptyline.
Less than three weeks later, Tracey died at her home after Beckett fed
her another overdose of Amitriptyline and Temazepam..
Nigel Rumfitt QC, for the prosecution, said social workers had been
guilty of serious misjudgments by allowing Tracey home to her mother
after the first overdose. The child was already on the social services'
child protection register.
He also criticised police for ''sloppy'' handling of the case after
tablets taken from Beckett's home were mislaid twice.
Beckett was only arrested after Tracey's body was exhumed in 1993 and
a new post-mortem examination concluded the tablets had caused her
death.
She has always denied the charges.
She told the jury during the trial that each overdose, including
Tracey's fatal poisoning, was accidental.
Tracey's body was exhumed in 1993, with the body of her sister, Clare,
who died aged seven after suffering a brain injury as a child.
A charge against Beckett of grievous bodily harm for this injury was
dropped during the trial.
Mr Stuart Brook, director of Nottinghamshire's Social Services
department, last night promised an independent inquiry into the case.

A MOTORIST convicted of dangerous driving won his appeal yesterday
because a sheriff fell asleep during his trial.
Temporary Sheriff John T Dean was snoring and awoke only after the bar
officer made several loud banging noises, three appeal court judges were
told.
The Justiciary Appeal Court ruled that Andrew Frew's conviction must
be set aside because justice had not been seen to be done.
At Ayr Sheriff Court on August 21 this year Sheriff Dean convicted Mr
Frew, 25, of Beechwood Avenue, Auchinleck, Ayrshire, of dangerous
driving, fined him #250, banned him from driving for a year, and ordered
him to resit a driving test.
Mr Frew appealed, arguing that he had suffered a miscarriage of
justice.
Ms Margaret Scott, counsel for Mr Frew, told Lord Justice Clerk Ross,
sitting with Lords Morison and Prosser, that the basis of the appeal was
that the sheriff had fallen asleep during the trial.
''The fact that he fell asleep was noticed by all those in the court
when the sheriff started to snore,'' added Ms Scott.
There was a pause in the questioning and the bar officer attempted to
wake the sheriff by making several loud banging noises.
In his report to the appeal court, Sheriff Dean said that during the
course of the trial he had been unaware of ''anything untoward''
happening.
The sheriff also suggested that the fact that a judge had fallen
asleep during a trial ''may not be unique in judicial history''.
The Crown began by arguing that there had been no miscarriage of
justice and estimated that the sheriff had dropped off for only about 15
seconds.
Mr Donald Mackay, QC, Solicitor-General, pointed out that after the
sheriff woke up the defence lawyer had gone over the same questions that
had been asked while he was asleep and the witness gave the same
answers.
Lord Prosser said that there might have been a lapse of concentration
on the sheriff's part before he fell asleep and no-one could tell how
long that had lasted.
Lord Morison intervened to say that if there was a trial in which the
judge had fallen asleep ''that is a plain instance of justice not being
seen to be done and that is the end of the matter''.
Mr Mackay conceded that in light of the observations by the appeal
court it would not be safe to proceed on the basis that justice had been
seen to be done.
Delivering the opinion of the court, Lord Ross said it had been
explained that the trial had take place on a particularly hot day in a
courtroom that had no air-conditioning. Others in court had experienced
discomfort from the conditions.
Lord Ross added, however: ''The rules of natural justice require not
only that justice be done but that justice be seen to be done.
''We would not dispute that justice may have been done, but we are
quite satisfied that in a case where the sheriff fell asleep for
whatever reason for what is admitted to be a substantial period, justice
cannot be said to have been seen to be done.''
He pointed out that after the sheriff awoke he appeared not to realise
what stage the trial had reached and called on the fiscal to re-examine
the police witness. The fiscal had to point out that the defence
solicitor had not yet completed his questioning.
''That appears to us to confirm that this was unfortunately a case
where it must be held that justice was not seen to be done.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Courts Administration said last night:
''It would be inappropriate to comment in advance of studying the full
text of the appeal court's decision.''

THE first severe gales of autumn brought widespread disruption to
Scotland yesterday.
Main roads throughout the Highlands were blocked by fallen trees and
thousands of households were without power when electricity cables were
brought down. In Shetland, winds gusted at Hurricane Force 12.
A couple escaped unhurt when a 60ft beech tree crashed onto their
bungalow in Inverkeithing, Fife. Mr Derek Grater and his wife Sandra had
finished washing supper dishes and retired to bed when the tree smashed
into their kitchen.
Mrs Grater said: ''Fortunately our bedroom is on the other side of the
house, otherwise we wouldn't have stood a chance.''
The damage to their home was so severe that it might have to be
rebuilt rather than repaired. The couple have moved in with relatives.
Uprooted trees blocked roads throughout Scotland.
The storm was caused by a deep depression which tracked over the
northof Scotland. In many places, strong winds abated by daybreak, but
gales are expected to return today.

Media ban lifted to allow campaign by father to raise money for
daughter's treatment.
AN 11-year-old girl with cancer who was saved by a mystery benefactor
after being refused treatment on the NHS spoke publicly for the first
time yesterday of her determination to stay alive.
Jaymee Bowen, formerly known as Child B, was finally able to speak out
after the Court of Appeal lifted an order banning the media from
revealing her identity.
The brave leukemia victim, who found herself at the centre of a legal
battle after a health authority refused to foot the bill for her
treatment, said in a television interview: ''I say never give up, unless
you are just on the last little drop of life you have in you.
''Never give up. If you give up, you will just end up with nothing
left.''
Speaking on the BBC One O'Clock News she added: ''I'd rather have gone
through more suffering to live than to not go through anything and
die.''
She also hit out angrily at Cambridge and Huntingdon Health
Authority's decision not to pay for her life-saving treatment.
Her message for the chief executive of the health authority was:
''Thank you for nothing.''
Yesterday's decision by three Court of Appeal judges in London was
taken to allow Jaymee's father, Mr David Bowen, to raise money for
further treatment for his daughter.
It was reported tody that Mr Bowen was planning to sue the health
trust who refused his daughter treatment. He told the Daily Mirror he
was consulting lawyers over the treatment Jaymee had received.
''I have grave concerns about the treatment Jaymee received. I have
been advised the health authorities have a case to answer,'' he said.
Mr Bowen, of Brook Road, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, was in court
to hear Master of the Rolls Sir Thomas Bingham, accept that making money
out of the story to help Jaymee was justifiable.
The judge said: ''I greatly regret the necessity to exploit the
medical problems of this child for purposes of financial gain.
''But I don't think the maintenance of reporting restrictions can be
justified if the consequence were the denial of treatment which might be
of therapeutic and life-saving benefit to the child.''
The original injunction was imposed last March when the court refused
to order Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Authority to reverse its
decision not to fund cancer treatment for Jaymee because of the #75,000
cost.
Her life was saved by a mystery benefactor who stepped in to pay for
the experimental treatment, involving bone-marrow transplants and
chemotherapy.
Jaymee is now winning her fight against acute myeloid leukemia after
having bone-marrow donations from her nine-year-old sister Charlotte.
But the court heard yesterday that she could suffer a relapse at any
time.
Mr Bowen said yesterday: ''If there was ever a child who scored well
on what she's gone through and what she's done, and her response to
drugs and her zest and appetite for life, this is the child.''
The court was told also that no more money was available from the
benefactor and, while paying for routine care and monitoring of Jaymee's
condition, the health authority was maintaining its refusal to fund
treatment which it regards as experimental.
Mr Bowen had a contract with the Daily Mirror which had so far paid
#6500 and was making #13,500 available for further treatment. The paper
was offering another #3000 if it was able to name the girl and her
family.
Much more money would be needed if the #75,000 course of treatment had
to be repeated and Mr Bowen was anxious to start raising a contingency
fund immediately by telling the full story.
Mr Bowen has told Jaymee all about her illness and the legal row
surrounding her. The court was told she had ''taken it all in her
stride'' and shown great interest, asking her father why the health
authority did not provide funds.
Ms Anna Pauffley, QC, for the Official Solicitor, who protects the
interest of children involved in court cases, had urged the appeal
judges to be cautious.
''If the child's identity is revealed, the press, although
superficially well intentioned, sympathetic and well-disposed to her in
her predicament, is not altogether motivated by altruism and may find an
angle on the story which the family would not welcome,'' she said.
But the Master of the Rolls, sitting with Family Division President
Sir Stephen Brown and Sir John Balcombe, said Mr Bowen should not be
forced to rely on the limited funding presently available from the Daily
Mirror in the event -- ''which everyone must hope is not the case'' --
of his daughter suffering a relapse.
The judges heard that the BBC was waiting to screen a Panorama
programme about Jaymee.
Two months ago, Mr Bowen was paid #750 for an interview with Best
magazine, which then published a full story with pictures while the
anonymity order was still in force.
Sir Thomas Bingham said the court accepted that Mr Bowen had believed
no such publicity would be given until the injunction had been lifted.
Labour MP Alf Morris said: ''This case shows the folly and inhumanity
of ministers and administrators trying to play God. This child's story
is the sharpest possible condemnation of allowing money to decide who
lives and who dies.
''In her case, a private donor provided the money. Her survival owes
nothing to public authority. She was left waiting to die by official
decision. But for her father's determination to fight for her life, she
would now be dead.''
Jaymee is being admitted to the Portland Hospital, London, for 48
hours during her half-term break.
Consultant haematologist Dr Peter Gravett, who has been treating
Jaymee, said in a statement last night: ''The purpose of the admission
is to adjust the drugs that she is being given to control the 'graft
versus host' process that is keeping her in remission from her
leukaemia.
She will be discharged at the weekend and will return to school after
half-term.

SIR Cliff Richard picked up his knighthood from the Queen, and was
amused after opening the medal box to find it inscribed ''Knight
Bachelor''. The singer, who has never shaken off the tag ''Bachelor
Boy'' after his early hit, grinned, saying: ''It's very apt.''
The Queen thanked him for the work he has done in entertainment and
for charity. His knighthood was awarded for charitable services. Sir
Cliff, 55, said: ''What I am proud of is that I have received this for
nothing to do with politics, commerce, or even rock and roll.''
The only artist to have chart-topping hits in five different decades,
he pledged to keep on rocking after 37 years in the business, and 115
hits, including 13 number ones.

THE Free Church theologian Professor Donald Macleod is to face
criminal proceedings over allegations of indecent behaviour involving
five women over an eight-year period.
A spokesman for the Crown Office yesterday said: ''We can confirm that
following instructions to Crown counsel, the procurator-fiscal at
Edinburgh has commenced summary criminal proceedings at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court.''
The spokesman said that Professor Macleod, who has three children and
lives in Edinburgh, had been cited to answer a summary complaint at the
court on November 15, when he will face six charges of indecent assault.
The General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland decided earlier
there were insufficient grounds to proceed with charges of censurable
conduct in the church court and the matter was said to be closed.

FIRMS will be protected from severe fines for employing illegal
immigrants in new laws to be introduced by Home Secretary Michael Howard
next month.
The Cabinet will today endorse in principle Mr Howard's clampdown,
although the details are still being contested by his colleagues.
Next week a Cabinet committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, will
analyse the political problems which have been raised by the Home
Secretary's proposals. Mr Howard has already conceded modifications of
his original proposals first put to Cabinet colleagues a fortnight ago.
These proposals alarmed the business community in Britain because
employers were being threatened with the prospect of being fined for
employing illegal immigrants.
They are now expected to be protected by a formula in the Bill for the
new session of Parliament next month establishing that they will be
punished if they ''knowingly'' employ an illegal immigrant.
Today's Cabinet is deciding the whole legislative programme for the
Government in the run up to the next General Election, with all the
political considerations in mind.
Mr Howard will get his legislation passed but in the next fortnight he
will have to convince his colleagues, including Mr Major, that they are
not racist and they are not based on a ''white list'' for allowing
foreigners into this country.
Depite reports, the countries the Government is said to be
particularly concerned about are those in Eastern Europe, notably
Poland, whose citizens are flocking west in search of the capitalist
dream their once-socialist homelands are finding it difficult to
produce.
However, the Prime Minister has backed his Home Secretary because
there is also a demand from the Tory Party for a serious attempt to
prevent the present laws on granting political asylum here from being
exploited by particular countries like Nigeria and Sri Lanka.
The Tory Party believes Nigerians have been allowed to exploit the
desperate political situation in their own country to run drugs and
crime syndicates into Britain. Mr Major is determined to support Mr
Howard in defining new laws to end this exploitation.
However, there could be difficult ramifications for some Cabinet
Ministers' departments, like Trade and Industry, and Education and
Employment.
Mr Major's concern that his Home Secretary gets his way in the main
thrust of the Bill has meant the Prime Minister talking privately to
Cabinet colleagues on this issue since his return from New York on
Tuesday night.
The Tories also see a political advantage in these proposals if the
Labour Party can be manoeuvred into a defence of potential illegal
immigrants who would upset the various ethnic communities throughout
Britain, and in particular the Asians and Chinese in Glasgow and the
Midlands in England.
Last night Mr Tony Blair's Shadow Cabinet did not discuss the issue
and this encourages the Tories at Westminster in the belief that if they
can get the legislation right, they can score political points in seats
vital to them in the next General Election.
A Times/Mori poll indicates today that the Government needs all the
help it can get to stand a chance in a General Election which could come
next autumn.
After the party conference season Labour is up five points to 56%,
while the Tories have dropped a point to 27%.
Only Mr Major's personal rating remains the same at 28%, while Mr
Blair's personal rating has increased from 45% to 52%.

<HEADLINE>Jobs lost for #9000 saving. Hospital's staff suffer the axe</HEADLINE>

A HOSPITAL trust which made a #2.5m surplus last year is to sack 67
workers and serve patients a 15.5p breakfast in order to save #9000.
Directors of Glasgow Royal Infirmary Trust will be confronted at a
public meeting tonight by the 67 catering, domestic, and portering staff
whose jobs are to be privatised to a company which will make #21,000
profit on the deal.
They all work at Canniesburn Hospital, where a market testing exercise
has resulted in Initial Health Care beating a private rival and an
in-house team for the contract.
Although some of them may find jobs with Initial, the overall hours
have been cut and union leader Jim Devine, of Unison, said none was
guaranteed re-employment.
''I am outraged that 67 workers who have worked loyally for this
hospital, some for as long as 25 years, should be treated in this way
for such a minuscule saving,'' he said.
Members of the trust board were told last month that awarding the
contract to Initial would save #61,000 a year.
However, a breakdown of the figures obtained by The Herald shows that
the difference between the in-house bid and the Initial bid was #9312 --
the in-house price was #722,016, as against #712,704.
The #61,000 is the difference between Initial's offer and what the
work overall previously cost the trust when it was shared between
Initial (domestic) and in-house (portering and catering).
The director of operations, Mr Alan Bowie, told the trust in September
that combining them would ''allow the tenderers to achieve economies of
scale in combining duties between traditionally separate functions, eg.
domestics delivering mail and porters cleaning corridors''.
He added: ''These savings will be achieved through the more efficient
use of staff, breaking down demarcation between the three service
functions, and a tighter specification of the contracted duties leading
to a reduction in ad hoc costs.''
Among the savings offered by Initial was #8000 in the cost of
patients' meals, including a breakfast at 15.5p as against 23.6p.
The net contract price comes out at #642,816 -- #58,399 less than the
in-house bid -- but to that must be added EU VAT adjustment of #9840,
which does not apply in-house, and redundancy and associated costs of
around #60,000 -- three times the in-house cost.
A trust spokesman said: ''Initial came up with the best deal. We have
a responsibility to run the service on behalf of the taxpayer.''
However, Mr Devine said: ''While the accounts may seem to be in order,
the fact is that we as taxpayers are going to have to foot the bill
because each of these people who ends up on the dole will cost us #9000.
''This trust has just under-spent by half-a-million pounds. They could
save #9000 by just not filling vacancies for two days. What this is
about is reducing pay and conditions. It is not about efficiency but
exploiting the lowest-paid workers in the hospital.''
The dispute comes only 15 months after a bruising row between unions
and management at the Royal Infirmary over the pay cuts being faced by
workers when their contract was being transferred from one contractor to
another. On that occasion the workers won.
Mr Mike Conroy, of the GMB union, said: ''We are very concerned about
various aspects of this contract and made our views known to management
at a joint meeting on Monday. A major campaign was fought in this
hospital only 15 months ago on the very issue of cuts in pay and
conditions of low-paid staff. We were not prepared to allow it to happen
then and we are not prepared to allow it to happen now.''
The meeting tonight at the Royal Infirmary is to present the trust's
first annual report and accounts. The chief executive, Mr Nigel Clifford
(#82,000 a year, including pension and perks) said: ''This is an
opportunity for people to come along and find out how we are delivering
health care to patients in the city.''
They will be told by finance director Brian Steven that the trust
achieved a surplus last year of #2,559,000. This exceeded the target set
by the NHS management executive by #499,000.

PROFESSOR Sir Robert Grieve, the first chairman of the Highlands and
Islands Development Board and one of Scotland's most eminent planners,
has died after a long illness. He was 84.
Friends and colleagues last night paid tribute to him. Mr Iain
MacAskill, the current chairman of the Crofters' Commission and a
colleague from the early days of the HIDB, said: ''He was a man of
vision, a very thoughtful man who knew the Highlands and Islands very
well.
''He was very sensitive to its needs, and very committed to the work
of the board. He stuck to his convictions throughout.''
Sir Douglas Hardie, former deputy chairman of the Scottish Development
Agency, said Sir Robert had been a valued judge for many years in the
annual Regeneration of Scotland design awards.
''I am very sad at this news,'' Sir Douglas said. ''He was full of
humour and his contribution to the judging panel was unique.''
Educated at North Kelvinside School and the Royal Technical College in
Glasgow, where he qualified as a civil engineer, Sir Robert began his
career in local government with Glasgow Corporation, Renfrew County
Council and Paisley Burgh Council.
Among his notable early achievements was his work on the Clyde Valley
regional plan.
He joined the Scottish Office in 1946, firstly as regional planning
officer for the Highlands and Islands, and then in the same capacity for
the Clyde Valley.
In 1960, he became chief planning officer for Scotland.
Glasgow University appointed him to the chair of town and regional
planning in 1964, the same year in which he was made planning consultant
to the Scottish Office.
A year later, Sir Robert took up the chairmanship of the HIDB, a role
he fulfilled for five years. He was knighted in 1969 and was later
appointed as an honorary professor at Heriot-Watt University.
Sir Robert is survived by two sons and two daughters. His wife, May,
died in 1984.

FORMER National Heritage Secretary David Mellor claimed in the Commons
last night that the Government had ''ambitions'' to take more tax out of
the proceeds it receives from the National Lottery.
However, he warned Ministers against pursuing any ''own goal'' which
would take the Treasury tax cut above the current 12%.
In comments which overshadowed a fiesty defence of the operation of
the lottery by Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley, Mr Mellor, a
former Chief Secretary to the Treasury said: ''One gathers there are
senior figures in the Treasury who still bear the bruises of what they
regard as a defeat in failing to get a tax rate that was higher.''
An increased tax rate, which he said was allowed under the rules and
60% of which would come out of prize money, would damage the credibility
of the lottery.
He added that if Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was contemplating an
increase in his Budget next month, it would be a spectacular ''own
goal'' for Ministers.
Describing lottery taxes as, ''A nice little earner for our Ken''
bringing an estimated #500m, plus corporation tax on Camelot's profits
into the Treasury, Mr Mellor cautioned the Government on taking more.
''In the history of own goals, that would merit a chapter all on its
own,'' he said.
He also said it was important that projects which benefited from
lottery proceeds were those close to the hearts of ordinary people.
He told the Commons that spending millions of pounds on the Churchill
Papers was a ''dubious purchase''.
And the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden had ''only had itself to
blame if it is seen as a wholly elitist institution from which most
ordinary members of the public are disenfranchised''.
He said: ''If the man in the street loses faith in the fact that the
expenditure of lottery money is about things that he and his family will
benefit from, then there is trouble.
''I have a real worry that with all this money being handed out, who
is monitoring how it is being spent and who is ensuring these wretched
things are delivered?
''I see the River Tiber foaming with many unfinished projects.''
As to the workings of Camelot, he warned the Opposition ''Not to let
it appear that the Labour Party would prefer a non-profit making
organisation, even an inefficient and ramshackle one, to an efficient,
profit-making organisation''.
