DUNDEE United, who made their way back north last night after their
premier division match with Partick Thistle at Firhill was postponed for
the fifth time, will take a charitable view of the inconvenience caused
by the latest referee's decision that came as they were on their way to
to Firhill, writes Ian Paul.
Chairman Jim McLean said: ''You can make allowances for rain, but as
we discovered ourselves on Saturday when our match with Falkirk was
postponed, a downpour can change everything.''
United had made their way to their Cumbernauld hotel for the third
time since the original date of the match, December 10, and had been
assured that the game was set fair.
However, Thistle secretary Robert Reid explained: ''The pitch, was
playable anytime until mid-afternoon when the rain came on.''
Referee Gerry Evans inspected at 5pm and decided the park was
waterlogged.
McLean made a plea on behalf of fans after explaining that he had
received a letter from a United supporter who insisted he would never go
to Firhill again if there was the slightest weather doubt.
''We can't afford to ignore fans' views on these things,'' McLean
said, ''and I believe we need a closer weather watch in these
situations. The forecast was for heavy rain.''
Thistle manager John Lambie said: ''This creates a real headache for
us. There is no way we wanted to see the game off, but the ref had no
option.
''We are fighting to retain our premier league place and wanted to win
points.
''I had a feeling that, with United involved in a cup-tie at the
weekend, this could be the right time to get them.''
The match has been rescheduled for Tuesday, March 7.
The weather also knocked out St Johnstone-Hamilton in the first
division and East Stirling-Albion Rovers in division three.

SCOTLAND'S soccer agents have been summoned to the Scottish Football
Association headquarters at Park Gardens in Glasgow this week . . . to
sit examinations, writes Ken Gallacher.
As part of the tightening up in regulations by the world governing
body FIFA in regard to players' agents, the men who want to handle that
kind of business will have to prove their knowledge of the game.
I understand that around half a dozen men, including Bill McMurdo,
Raymond Sparkes, and former Dunfermline director Blair Morgan,, have
applied to be registered as agents under the new guidelines.
All have had to post a #100,000 bank guarantee, which will be lodged
with a Swiss bank.
Now they have to convince the inquisitors at Park Gardens that they
have the knowledge to fulfil the role as it is interpreted by the men in
Switzerland.
A spokesman for the SFA said: ''We have been asked by FIFA to
undertake these interviews, and that is what we will be doing.
''It is essential to maintain standards within the game. That is the
basic reason behind the whole of FIFA's thinking on the matter.''
The would-be agents face questions on the rules and regulations of
FIFA and UEFA as well as the SFA and the Scottish League.
They must also be able to show knowledge of contract laws.
Only by coming through the tests succesfully will they be allowed to
practise as agents.
If they fail, then they will not be able to represent whatever clients
they may have . . . and the players themselves could be fined or even
banned from the game.
Action could also be taken against clubs who use the services of an
unauthorised agent.

FORMER Scotland internationalist Ian St John launched a Walkers Crisps
promotion for his country's under-15 Schoolboys' team by blasting the
state of the game, writes Ken Gallacher.
Joining in a criticism that has stemmed from Manchester United's Alex
Ferguson and Newcastle's Kevin Keegan, the television pundit insisted:
''None of the big clubs now has scouts in Scotland because the quality
of players is not here.
''In fact, if you look at the top teams down south it is hard to find
a Scottish player involved. -- far different from when I played.
''Then, every top team had a handful of Scots. Now you have Gary
McAllister at Leeds, Colin Hendry at Blackburn, and Brian McClair at
Manchester United and that's it.
''There is not even any great quality in the national team and no
great interest in how Scotland performs any more.''
The Scots schoolboys play Brazil at Hampden on March 7.
It is part of a double date for the South Americans, who will face
England on a trip that will cost #24,000 between the two countries.

CELTIC have backed off from a showdown with the Scottish Football
Association over the compensation claim from Kilmarnock for Parkhead
manager Tommy Burns.
The longest running football soap opera of the season is now set to
end early next month after the Parkhead club agreed to accept the
decision reached by the tribunal set up by the SFA.
Chairman, Lord Ranald McLean, former Hearts' director, Jim Clydesdale,
and Morton chairman John Wilson, will now rule on the matter. They will
decide just how much money must be paid by Celtic to Kilmarnock after
the poaching of Burns in the summer.
Last week, although the SFA had earlier decided on this format,
Celtic's chief executive, Fergus McCann, decided that the club would not
be bound by any ruling made.
That defiance came after the Parkhead side had already been fined
#100,000 by the Scottish League for appointing Burns while he was under
contract to Kilmarnock as manager and, also, as a player.
Celtic appealed, lost that, and subsequently decided to take on the
establishment over the possible tribunal findings.
Now that has changed and the Glasgow side have retreated from a
possible confrontation with the SFA.
Last week, they were warned by the association's chief executive, Jim
Farry, that if the clubs would not resolve the dispute -- which has
lasted since the summer -- then the SFA would step in.
He added then: ''This must be settled within the game. That is our
remit from FIFA and we intend to follow it through.''
Yesterday, after a series of private letters between the game's rulers
and Celtic, the club agreed to accept the verdict of the tribunal.
Last night, Farry said: ''The Association has been appointed as the
clerk to the tribunal itself. That means that the decision handed down
is made by the tribunal alone rather than by the SFA.
''The main thing, however, is that Celtic have agreed to abide by the
decision when it is made and that should now end this matter. I would
expect the submissions from the two clubs to arrive here soon and then,
early next month, the tribunal can meet and announce the level of
compensation they find appropriate.''
Despite the worries expressed by Celtic, that figure may fall short of
the #350,000 Kilmarnock are demanding. Indeed, I think that following
the record fine imposed by the League, plus the lesser fines on Burns
and Billy Stark, the punishment may not reach six figures.
However, the major break-through is that Celtic and Fergus McCann have
seen sense. They have realised that they cannot buck the system.
Whatever happens now, relations between Celtic and the SFA should
start to improve. Celtic will accept their punishment and the rest of us
can push the Tommy Burns' poaching saga out of our minds.
It has been an episode which is now best forgotten.

RANGERS manager Walter Smith will have to use all his proven
persuasive powers to entice young Dutchman Rob Mackaay to head for
Scotland. The 19-year-old prodigy of Vitesse Arnheim said yesterday that
he had been told of Rangers' interest, but was not keen to sample
Scottish, or even British football.
The lad has a mind of his own, like so many Dutch players, but he
would not be the first foreigner to need some persuading by the Ibrox
club that life in the premier division is not quite the ordeal painted
by some observers abroad.
However, he seems quite determined about how his future will unfold.
''The type of football played in Scotland does not attract me,'' he
said. ''I am under contract with Vitesse until 1998, and when I do leave
I would like to try another type of football, not British.''
Mackaay has been watched by Rangers on a number of occasions and is
also very much valued by bigger Dutch clubs. The snag for the home teams
like Ajax and PSV Eindhoven is that they rarely pay the kind of money
that will be needed to persuade Vitesse to part with Mackaay. Rangers,
on the other hand, will be capable of entering the #2m arena to take the
player from his preferred environment.
His sights may be set on Italy or Spain, but that may not deter
Rangers from trying to demonstrate the benefits of life in Scotland.
The Dutch, whose market place is still geared to sensible prices,
still anticipate even more raiding parties from Britain in particular,
following the transfer of Pierre van Hooydonk to Celtic, and Glenn
Helder yesterday from Vitesse to Arsenal in a deal worth around #2m.
It takes the recent transfer dealings of manager George Graham to #6m,
John Hartson from Luton and Chris Kiwomya from Ipswich being the others.
The Dutch already have the most successful youth policy in Europe, at
Ajax, where Celtic manager Tommy Burns has been impressed on a recent
visit, but Feyenoord have taken the Dutch innovation to new dimensions
this week by raiding the back streets of Brazil.
The club sent over coaches to Brazil, and persuaded one or two of the
beach teams peopled by waifs from desperately poor homes to let them
take back to Holland -- with parental permission -- three of the most
exciting talents among the 13-year-olds. In return Feyenoord have
provided the teams with shirts, footballs, and other assistance.

IT IS not just because he delivers one-liners with the ease of another
Irishman, Frank Carson, that Jimmy Nicholl is a bit different from his
peers in the Scottish game. It is his talent for combining that sharp
wit with an ability to convince ordinary players that they can be
extraordinary which makes him one of the most exciting young leaders in
the business.
Nicholl was able to persuade his players that they could beat Celtic
in the Coca-Cola Cup final, a feat that all bar the most avid Raith
Rovers follower did not believe possible. His Svengali act produced the
most memorable victory in the club's history and remains the most
astonishing result in the past decade.
That was followed by celebrations and parties that went on long after
the rest of the country had returned to normal, and left the manager
with perhaps the most demanding task he had faced since he took up the
player-manager role after a successful career with, among others,
Manchester United, West Brom, and Rangers.
The likelihood that a small club like Rovers would find great
difficulty in returning to earth meant that the manager had to restore
the work ethic rather quickly if the bid to get back into the promotion
race in the first division was to be established.
He and his players have managed it so well that they have won nine,
drawn one, and lost only one of their 11 matches since that thrilling
Sunday in November. Now they lie joint-top of the division and are about
to take on the other leading promotion candidate, Dundee, in the
Tennents Scottish Cup tie on Saturday.
When he was reminded that only his side can win the cup double, his
response was typical. ''We are going for a Yankee -- League Cup,
Scottish Cup, first division, and Fife Cup. Three out of four would
do.''
Nicholl admits that the League Cup triumph brought with it changes in
the way other teams approached matches against them.
''It was Jimmy Bone, of St Mirren, who pointed out that teams would
now try all that harder, because we were the team everybody talked
about. He was right -- his team drew with us in our second game after
the final.''
Raith also drew their first match following the celebrations, at Ayr,
and then lost to Dundee in their third. He recalls that Tuesday night
when Saints drew at Stark's Park as the time when Bone's observations
sank home. ''We paraded the cup around the ground, there was a good
crowd here, and everybody was on a high. But then you sit down and
realise that if you are to take advantage of the bigger crowds that
result after the win in the cup, you have to work just as hard as you
did to get there.''
Nicholl's hopes that the success in November would generate a bigger
average crowd at Stark's Park have been fulfilled. From crowds of
between 800 and 1000 before the final, Raith's numbers have risen to
close to 4000, a tremendous improvement.
He is not one of those who will go along with the cliche that the
losers of the cup-tie will have the advantage of being able to
concentrate solely on the league race. ''It is something we managers say
after losing a game like this, but it is not really true. I know I will
prefer to be still in the cup, for all the morale boost it gives a
team.''
He has no personnel problems for the big day. He is fit after having
missed two games with a calf injury and seems a certain starter. ''If
Danny Lennon can get into the Northern Ireland B squad, I am going out
there to play for my place in the same team. That's for sure.''

The heavily backed six-year-old collapsed and died on the way to the

the Winning Line phone service, which had tipped the horse.
Pipe said: ''The Jockey Club vet at Hereford took a blood sample from

He added that the owner had asked for a post-mortem.

AFTER an opening day session that lasted 17[3/4] hours and finished at
2.45am yesterday, the second day of the World Indoor Bowls Championships
switched to the singles.
Bainfield's Alex Marshall added to his pairs win with Richard Corsie
when he reached the second round with a four-set win over Canada's Peter
Mutter.
Marshall needed just two ends to take the opening set on a 7-0
whitewash, adding a 3 to his opening end maximum.
He then forged into a 6-1 lead after just four ends of the second set,
and looked to be on the way to a convincing victory.
However, Mutter narrowed the gap with a fifth-end double, added
singles on the next two ends, then picked up another couple to take the
set 7-6.
But the Edinburgh man was back in command just three ends later.
Another maximum, followed by a single and double, gave him the third set
7-0 and he went on to wrap up victory with a 7-4 in the next.
''I got a bit careless in the second set and a couple of running bowls
got the wrong results. That undid all my early good work,'' Marshall
said later.
The win puts him through to a potential clash with defending champion
and No.1 seed Andy Thomson, provided the title-holder successfully
negotiates his opening hurdle on Friday against Jersey's David Le
Marquand.
The first seed to lose was Scotland's Willie Wood, who went down in
five sets to South Africa's Neil Burkett.
Wood, the No.12 seed, made a first-round exit for the third time in
four years when he lost 7-1, 5-7, 7-3, 1-7, 5-7 to the Commonwealth
Games fours gold medallist.
The Scot looked to be heading for a second-round place when he led by
two sets to one. However, Burkett hit back with a 7-1 win in the fourth
set and then, at 5-5 in the decider, picked up a match-winning double on
the sixth end.
A disappointed Wood said: ''The longer the match went, the stronger
Neil became, and when I lost the fourth set, I knew it would be hard.
''The big problem was that I wasn't driving well. I consider myself a
good driver, but I missed everything.''
Graham Robertson also tumbled out last night when he went down in a
four-and-a-quarter-hour marathon against Robert Weale, from Wales, by
7-6, 4-7, 2-7, 7-2, 5-7.
In the only pairs match, former winners Gary Smith and Andy Thomson
had a 7-5, 6-7, 7-6, 7-2 win over Welsh pair Islwyn Morgan and Colin
Piper.

NOW that the amateur game is, for many players, the equivalent of a
swing door leading to the seductive rewards dangled before the aspiring
tournament professional, rather as the actor's life was to Pinocchio,
the prolonged careers amateurs had until some 30 years ago have, like
nostalgia, become a thing of the past.
The longevity enjoyed by the Ronnie Shades, Michael Bonallacks, and
Joe Carrs is unlikely ever to be experienced again. Their names and
reputations were as well known to the golfing public, and as extensively
recorded, as those among their contemporaries who often doubled as both
tournament and club professional.
Indeed, on either side of the Second World War a match, the equivalent
of cricket's Gentlemen v Players, was held between the Amateurs and the
Professionals. Frank Deighton, the Walker Cup player and twice Scottish
champion, played in the 1956 and 1957 encounters and has interesting
memories of them.
Deighton remembers that his partnership with Joe Carr prevailed over
Dai Rees and Max Faulkner by 3 and 2, in the singles he beat Faulkner 6
and 5, that Carr beat Rees by 9 and 8, and that Reid Jack saw off Harry
Bradshaw. Results such as that in games decided over 36 holes would be
impossible to imagine happening against the leading professionals of
today.
All of which is by way of being a preamble to Walter McLeod, who may
not be a household name now in Scottish golf at large, but who last week
scaled his eightieth birthday peak 60 years after having then become the
youngest player to represent his country in the Home Internationals. He,
too, collected his very fair share of notable scalps.
On two occasions McLeod beat England's Cyril Tolley, the Walker Cup
player and twice winner of the Amateur Championship. ''I invited him for
a drink after both games, but he never turned up in the bar,'' McLeod
recollected. ''I don't think he took defeat very well.'' He halved with
Jimmy Bruen, also winner of the British title -- whereby hangs another
tale.
The Irishman, who had a flying right elbow famous long before Jack
Nicklaus's and the hitting power of a latter-day John Daly, retired from
competitive golf during the same championship at Royal Portrush in 1960,
when Carr won the last of his three British titles. The event also was
the first at that rarefied level attended by this observer.
The wrist injury, which had kept Bruen out of the game for some years,
recurred after only two holes of his match against Billy Steel, the
brother of Donald, the golf course architect. ''I'll be giving you the
match,'' Bruen alerted his somewhat startled opponent, ''but we'll play
some more holes so as not to disappoint all these spectators.''
Walter and his elder brother, Alastair, played on the same
international sides in 1937 and 1938, still, if the Scottish Golf
Union's Year Book is accurate, the only siblings to do so. In those days
good performances in, apart from the national championships, the Tennant
Cup, Edward Trophy, and the Glasgow championship were the main
yardsticks for selection.
Eventually McLeod himself served as a selector, for 15 years on both
the SGU and Royal and Ancient Club's committees, in the latter capacity
involved in forming the 1971 team which at St Andrews won the Walker Cup
for the second time. The war years excepted, McLeod was, therefore,
involved in the game during four decades.
Appropriately, members of the 32 Club, of which he has been captain
and is currently the president, helped McLeod to celebrate his four
score years with a surprise lunch at the Royal Scottish Automobile Club
-- ''like someting out of This is Your Life,'' as he later described the
occasion.
Incidentally, in his 1950 Golfer's Handbook entry McLeod warranted as
many lines as Archie Compston and two more than Joyce Wethered.

AN estimated television audience of 550m basketball fans from all
quarters of the globe watched last weekend's annual NBA All Star game
between the Western Conference and the Eastern Conference in Phoenix,
Arizona.
The telecast of this glitzy showbiz occasion at the court of Charles
Barkley and the Phoenix Suns, went out in 40 languages and confirmed
that the game can no longer be written off as a purely American
phenomenon, though it appears to be as important to be seen at courtside
as on court at these All Star affairs.
If the current spectacular growth continues it may soon rival the
Super Bowl, which this year attracted a TV audience of 750m.
Mitch Richmond, from the unfashionable Sacramento Kings, was named the
game's Most Valuable Player after a remarkable shooting display in the
West's 139-112 victory. But not everyone was impressed.
''Like the Super Bowl, it was all hype and no action,'' was the
reaction of Kevin Cadle, the former Scottish national team coach who now
presents Sky's NBA coverage in Britain.
''It wasn't a good game, but the West underlined the concept of team
basketball with their sprinkling of veterans, while the East had too
many youngsters,'' added Cadle.
The ''youngsters'' included Grant Hill, the Detroit Pistons forward
who was the first rookie ever to top the voting for the All Star Game.
More than 6,250,000 votes were cast -- double the previous season's
total -- with Hill totalling 1,289,585 to edge out Orlando Magic's
seven-foot giant Shaquille O'Neal and last year's MVP, Scottie Pippen of
the Chicago Bulls. Barkley led the votes for the West team with
1,046,105.
Cadle is more impressd by the news that the next NBA champions,
whoever they may be, are coming to the London Arena next October to take
part in the McDonald's Open -- and that the English champions will be
invited as one of the six teams taking part in what is rapidly becoming
a world team championship.
Also taking part will be the European champions, and probably the
Spanish, Italian and Greek title winners,
Building a
new castle
ROWING: By MIKE HAGGERTY
AFTER more than two years of being homeless, the Castle Semple rowing
club have finally been given the green light to build a new boathouse.
Based within the Clyde Muirshiel Country Park, the club's original
site was commandeered by the park owners, Strathclyde Regional Council,
when work started on a new visitors' centre. Since then, the club has
involved itself in major fund-raising and sponsorship drives as well as
negotiations about how and where their new boathouse could be built.
That effort has now come to fruition with a grant application to the
Foundation For Sport and the Arts being successful, although the club
has yet to hear the exact amount, and negotiations with Renfrewshire
Enterprise, who will help build the clubhouse through their training
programmes, about to reach a satisfactory solution.
If all goes to plan, Castle Semple will be in new premises before the
end of the year.

PETER Gordon, the discus thrower who is suffering from testicular
cancer, has won his fight to have a four-year suspension lifted. The
IAAF doping commission has recommended reinstatement and this will be
ratified in May by the IAAF council.
The 43-year-old Geordie, who protested that he had never taken
performance-enhancing drugs, was banned after he was unable to give a
full urine sample when tested at a meeting at Crystal Palace. Now he
hopes to compete as a veteran.
Three months ago the suspension was lifted by the British Athletic
Federation because of his ''grave medical condition.'' But the world
body could not act because BAF officials failed to supply the necessary

' I'm training well
and I'm confident.
But nothing
tells the truth
like a race '
THE traditional Liz McColgan confidence and defiance persists, even
after almost two years racked by injury and pain -- ''I've not reached
my peak yet . . . yes, I still believe I can break the world marathon
record.''
Humility was never McColgan's strong suit, nor should it be. You don't
aspire to the top in sport without a guid conceit of yourself -- but
Britain's greatest woman endurance runner is now a very different person
from the one who won the world 10,000 metres title, brought home two
Commonwealth golds, and rewrote the record books.
Though the aggression remains, gone is the sheer conviction that she
was always right. ''I am older and wiser,'' she confessed meekly. ''I
made lots of mistakes.''
McColgan was speaking yesterday as she faced up to the strength of the
opposition she will meet on April 2, when she runs the NutraSweet London
Marathon -- holder and three-times winner Katrin Dorre, double
Commonwealth champion Lisa Ondieki, and reigning European champion
Manuela Machado.
The race will confirm whether the 30-year-old Scot has a future to
match her glittering past, and is one that she must run to fulfil the
most lucrative contract ever enjoyed by a British athlete, worth a
reputed #500,000. She must also finish next year to complete the
bargain.
But the money means little to her. McColgan, who has escaped
working-class poverty and Dundee's jute mills by her athletic prowess,
would still be trotting round the Angus countryside for the love of it
even if there were not a penny at stake. And that truth endures, despite
the fact that every step she runs brings pain in her left foot.
The first crucial test comes on Saturday, when she races the 15,000m
Gasparilla event in Tampa, Florida. ''That will let me know what shape I
am in,'' she said. ''I am training well, and I'm confident. But nothing
tells the truth like a race.''
Many have written off McColgan already, but she is used to that. After
the birth of her daughter, Eilish, her 10,000m prospects at the 1991
World championships in Tokyo were dismissed. Yet, despite the heat and
humidity, her critics were confronted with the greatest endurance run in
history by any British athlete, man or woman.
Two months later she clocked the fastest-ever debut marathon time,
when she won New York. Following that success, she could not say no.
She ignored the advice of her husband-coach Peter to slow down, but
she ignored him. Her body cracked up, and one injury followed another,
threatening to end her career.
''Peter was bending over backwards to try to stop me, but I didn't
listen to him,'' McColgan admitted. If I had stepped back then, a lot of
my problems would not have occurred. Instead, I went from race to
race.''
Following the 1993 London event she had problems with her knee and
foot. ''If it were not for the surgeon and physiotherapist who treated
me, I would not be running at all. I couldn't straighten the knee, and
some doctors said I would never run again. But I refused to believe
them. I had physio for two hours at a time, twice a day, month after
month.
''Peter, my mum and dad, my family, pulled me through. Without their
emotional support I would not have survived.
''Now, I'm not so closed to other people's ideas. I know I have to
pick and choose races more carefully. I'm an older and wiser person. You
could not go through what I have done and not learn a few lessons. I can
see where I went wrong and I realise how close I came to losing it
all.''
She is delighted that there is such a strong entry for the race where
her problems began. ''If people have written me off, that's fine. With
all these big names there will be no pressure. But the doubters are in
for a surprise. I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't believe I was
competitive enough to win.
''I think my best performances are still to come. I am training harder
now, and better, than ever in my life. I still believe I'm good enough
to break the world marathon record. I always wanted to be the first
woman to break 2hr 20min, and I believe I can run that fast. But other
girls are capable of it, too.
''I certainly won't be chasing a time in London, just trying to win.
After that I hope to do the 10,000m for Britain at the World
championships in Sweden -- try and win back the title that the Chinese
took when I was out injured.
''I don't give a thought to the (world record) times they ran. And
next year, once I have got the London race out of the way, my sights
will be on the marathon at the Atlanta Olympics.
''Too hot and humid? They said that about Tokyo, and I won. I have
been living and training in Florida off and on for five years now. I
will be better acclimatised to the conditions than any European.''
McColgan has raced three times since returning from injury, but only
once in Britain, when she won a 10,000m race in Coventry last October.
Since then she has won a 15,000m race in Holland, in course record time,
and was runner-up over 6000m in Switzerland, on a cobbbled course that
she negotiated carefully.
After Tampa she has a race in Orlando, on the course where she set
10,000m world road bests in 1987 and '88. The stop watch does not lie.
Comparison will show whether the old McColgan is back.
''I am mentally tougher now, and looking forward to it,'' she insists.
''After so long without racing I am even more competitive.''

TOP-flight contenders in the 4x4 market include Land Rover,
Mitsubishi, Isuzu and Jeep.
Land Rover, with the Defender, Discovery and the newly engineered MK2
Range Rover has the most powerful presence.
The Defender is a heavy duty vehicle that has been tailored to suit
the requirements of drivers who need ability first and comfort a distant
second.
Off road it is arguably the best in the business. Its aluminium body
panels allow it to shrug off weather and it is offered with a choice of
three engines and four trim levels, prices spanning the #16,826 --
#18,665 range.
Several steps up the ladder is the Discovery from the same company.
Basically a Range Rover for people who want all of the performance of
its bigger stablemate, but at a lower price, the Discovery is the
vehicle that set the world of 4x4 motoring on its ear.
Wildly popular from its launch, it is now in huge demand worldwide --
so much so that the Solihull factory is working 24 hours a day just to
meet the existing order book.
Much the same is true of the Range Rover production line.Britain's
best on/off roadster is still the unchallenged world leader in terms of
technical brilliance allied to sheer luxury.
It will waft along motorways like an executive express or shoulder its
way through forests with the best of the utility brigade.
Recently restyled and given some new, improved engines, the Range
Rover really is worth its hefty price tag, which starts at #32,362 and
peaks at an eye-popping #44,362.
With the Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen, (even more expensive), selling in
penny numbers, the German company is pinning its faith on a new, better
specified and cheaper model due here sometime in 1996.
That leaves Mitsubishi as the only manufacturer prepared to take on
the Range Rover in a head to head battle for the top end of the market.
Its contender, the Shogun, is a serious off-roader as well as being an
amazingly luxurious motorway flyer.
Although you can specify a 2.5 litre diesel at #21,500, the best of
the Shoguns is the mighty 3.5 litre V6. This one comes with air
conditioning, leather seats, anti-lock brakes, CD system and just about
every navigational aid you can think of.
Some drivers find its appearance slightly ostenatious, while others
swear it is even better than the Range Rover.
Certainly the Shogun, sold elsewhere in the world as the Pajero, is a
hugely successful vehicle which demonstrates what the Japanese can do
when they pull out all the stops.
Isuzu? yes, they are still with us, despite having most of the
company's output in the UK badged as Vauxhalls.
The Trooper, a value-for-money alternative to the Land Rover
Diuscovery is now marginally more expensive than the Vauxhall version,
the Monterey, but there are 12 models available, from #18,249 to
#24,749. All are spacious, good looking and powerful machines that have
earned excellent reviews (and a loyal customer base) over the years.
And finally, the newest contender in the ''quality'' stakes is also
the most venerable.
Enter Jeep, with top model ranges, the Wrangler and Cherokee on the
prowl.
The Americans claim that they invented 4x4 driving, understand it
better than anyone else -- and build the best off-roaders in the
business.
They have a case. The Wrangler, all chrome and Sands of Iowa Jima
macho posturing, is a fun machine, pure and simple. The Cherokee, on the
other hand, is a very serious piece of kit indeed.
It is also astonishingly cheap. Leather seating, walnut trim, auto box
and a mighty 4.0 litre petrol engine that could pull the side out of a
house for #22,747.  There has to be a mistake somewhere. Here's hoping
the importers don't rectify it just yet!

ENTRY into the world of 4x4 motoring isn't expensive nowadays, thanks
to the plethora of models arriving here from Japan and the emerging
Asian countries.
Best established of these is Suzuki. Not too long ago the Samurai from
that company was a hot seller, top of the budget class and a vehicle
eagerly sought after by younger drivers as well as playing the role of
second car to many families.
Cheeky, cheerful and with the minimum of equipment, it still
represents excellent value for money.
Just #8300 buys a Samurai Sport soft top, a modestly powered little
car (just 63 bhp on tap) which is equally happy doing duty as a city
shopping trolley as it is scampering across country.
But the Samurai's stablemate, the much more lavishly equipped and more
powerful Vitara, has hogged the limelight in recent years.
Still not expensive, with prices starting at #9635, the Vitara was
designed to display all the roadgoing comfort of a family saloon while
doubling up as a genuine go-anywhere mud-plugger.
Its 1.6 litre engine offers 17 bhp more than the Samurai's engine,
sufficient to give it a maximum speed of 88 mph and make it a much
better motorway proposition.
Suzuki could claim that the success of the Vitara, which generated a
long waiting list when it was first announced, inspired other dedicated
''leisure vehicles'' such as the RAV4 from Toyota.
This one differs from other 4x4s in that it has no low-ratio transfer
box installed. This, according to some pundits, means it isn't a true
on/off road machine, but the truth is that it will take all but the most
serious cross-country work in its stride.
At the same time it is one of the best 4x4s when used on tarmac. With
a 2.0 litre petrol engine pumping out 129 bhp, performance is impressive
by any measurement. An acceleration time from 0-60 mph of just 10
seconds and a theoretical top speed of 106 mph says it all. The entry
level RAV4 costs #13,066.
Not so spritely, but still firm favourites out in the country are the
Sportrak and Fourtrak ranges from Daihatsu.
Both have been in the UK for a number of years, but in recent times
have been completely refurbished, giving them a much wider appeal.
The Sportrak range, powered by a 1.6 litre petrol engine, promises
lots of fun and even more style for under #12,000.
The Fourtrak, with a purposeful 2.8 litre diesel installed, is a much
more serious piece of machinery altogether. From #14,910 it has few
faults other than its restricted load carrying capacity.
Add another thousand or so and the Vauxhall Frontera comes into focus.
Using familiar GM engines wrapped up in an Isuzu-developed chassis, the
Frontera was rushed into the market to blunt the impact of two later
arrivals, Ford's Maverick and the Nissan Terrano.
The Frontera is bigger, much more macho and although its dashboard
design isn't exactly an award winner, buyers do get a lot of vehicle for
their money.
The ride can be bouncy when the going gets rough, but driving it is
fun and the car certainly has a commanding on-road presence.
By contrast the later Ford and Nissan rivals, (development costs were
shared by the two companies), seems more modern and sophisticated. In
fact both perform almost exactly on a par with the Frontera. They are
more rounded in shape and boast tidier interiors.
The differences between the Maverick and the Terrano are more
difficult to spot, apart from the badging. As a guide, the Ford version
offers base and top specification with the Terrano occupying the space
in between. Prices start at #14,675.
Much cheaper are two of the Asian contenders, the Mahindra from India
and Asia Motors' Rocsta, which hails from Korea.
Both are blatant copies of the original Jeep, but under the skin they
have more modern engines and transmissions.
The Mahindra utilises a 2.2 litre Peugeot diesel. This power unit is
an old design no longer used in Europe. Despite its lack of power (60
bhp), it offers low running costs and promises good reliability.
On road the Mahindra CJ3 is fairly uncomfortable and driving it well
takes a bit of practice. But at #8283 for the cheapest version it has
been attracting a lot of young drivers who love its retro-looks.
The Korean-built Rocsta could almost be a Mahindra clone, but it costs
#9900 for the least expensive version. If you opt for the range-topper,
be prepared to sign a cheque for #11,200.
Again not the easiest car to drive in town, it has vague steering and
a very wide turning circle. But it does come with a choice of 77 bhp
petrol or 2.2 litre diesel engine, both of them capable (just) of
exceeding the motorway speed limit.
Nicely finished, the Mazda-engined petrol version is the one to go
for.
Cheaper still is one of the most venerable 4x4s still on sale in this
country, the Lada Niva.
The epitome of no-frills driving, the Niva is coarse, rough, has
unreliable instruments (watch the fuel warning light come on when the
tank is still three-quarters full), but it costs just #6390 in its basic
form.
Surprisingly, despite all its faults, the Niva bows to none when it
comes to hard work. It will give the Land Rover a run for its money on
really rough ground, which is why it is a firm favourite with
budget-conscious local authorities who need solid, reliable workhorses
that require the minimum of fettling.

Ross Finlay road tests
the Citroen XM 2.5 turbo
diesel
MANY people in the fortunate position of looking around for an
executive-class car not too much dearer than #20,000 cannot see farther
than Munich or Stuttgart. Rennes may not be a name which springs so
quickly to mind, but that is where Citroen builds its biggest saloons
and estate cars, the XM series.
There is a wide range of substantially upgraded XMs available, from
the basic two-litre petrol jobs at #16,315 to the V6 automatic Exclusive
estate at #27,320. I was driving a model with a handsome specification
for its price, a 2.5-litre turbo diesel VSX saloon at #20,395.
You could hardly say, since it includes some fairly curious styling
features, that the XM body was inspired in the first place by
wind-tunnel considerations. But Citroen knows all about aerodynamics,
and the XM has a very low Cd figure.
As so many cars have proved, that does not always -- although lay folk
think it should -- guarantee similar levels of wind noise. But the test
car was the quietest big diesel Citroen I can remember driving. Once on
the move, that is. The 2.5 turbo engine sounds pretty rough at start-up.
The body offers really impressive passenger space, with well shaped
front seats and rear seats which, despite being of the split-fold
design, have good under-thigh support. Rear passengers have heater
outlets set into the B-pillars. As on all big Citroens, the boot is
massive and with no obstructions, so that the full available volume can
be stacked with cases or boxes.
Another sensible point is that the XM saloon is double-glazed at the
rear. At least, when you open the hatchback, an inner rear window stays
in place, keeping draughts, noise and fumes away from the interior.
The VSX specification includes features such as anti-lock brakes,
deadlocks, a keypad engine immobiliser, alarm system, a sunroof, a
nearside door mirror which dips to show the kerb whenever you select
reverse, and computer control for the XM's inter-connected
hydropneumatic suspension. Self-levelling so that the car stays on an
even keel regardless of load, and adjustable in ground clearance, it
copes easily with any kind of surface. However, it crashes over really
big humps or hump-backed bridges.
On the road, the suspension adjusts itself instantly between hard and
soft settings, allowing a more sporting approach and substantially
cutting body roll. The latest version of the XM is the best there has
been on varied types of road, as I found on one drive which took in both
Glencoe and the much narrower and twisting road in Glen Lonan.
You have to watch the XM steering, and not let the car run wide even
on slowly taken corners. This is not a matter of understeer, but simply
of remembering to turn the wheel enough. The turning circle is by no
means tight. Minor switches are rather splattered about, and I found
that there was not enough toe-room around the throttle pedal, which led
to one or two clumsy moments. The foot-operated and hand-released
parking brake is as awful as most systems of this persuasion.
Peaking at 130bhp, the 2.5-litre turbo diesel engine also produces
overwhelming torque -- a maximum of 217lb ft at as low a speed as
2000rpm. As a result, as well as reaching 60mph in about 10.5 seconds
and whisking on to a test track maximum around 125mph, it has vast
reserves of mid-range pull. Fuel returns should be about 55mpg at 56mph,
41 at 75 and 30mpg in town.
Build quality has been improved through the years the XM has been in
production. For space and comfort the car has very few similar-price
rivals.  Ride, performance and economy are top class. And with all that,
you have a car designed by people who go their own highly individual
way.

PIT Pony galloped through the mud at Ayr to win his first race for
almost six years and bring an overdue success to trainer David
Robertson.
Only two of the six runners in the Marchburn Chase survived the
stamina-sapping race, but Pit Pony loved the conditions and sailed home
by 15 lengths, leaving Sheelin Lad, the odds-on favourite trailing.
He was one of six Scottish-trained winners who found the heavy ground
to their liking on an afternoon of heavy rain in which Uttoxeter called
off and Newbury and Catterick abandoned mid-card.
Pit Pony and his trainer were given a tremendous reception by the
small crowd who braved the elements.
The 11-year-old was popular when based at Cree Lodge, winning won four
hurdle races for John Wilson.
Robertson bought Pit Pony from Linda Perratt 18 months ago, and until
Saturday his best performance had been a fourth at Ayr.
''I always thought he liked heavy ground, but I was by no means
confident.'' he explained.
After Youand I had won the Martnaham Hurdle by 10 lengths from Craigie
Rambler 50-1 -- another Robertson horse -- Len Lungo gave most of the
credit to the owner-breeder, James Nelson.
''They are the backbone of jump racing,'' said Lungo, ''and really
deserve some luck. Nelson, who farms near Lockerbie, also bred her
sister, Linngate, and Bishops Pawn.
Although Sheelin Lad was beaten and Livio fell when exhausted, Lungo
completed a short-priced double when Nawrick, at 4-5, stayed on to beat
Carousel Rocket in the Carsphairn Chase.
With 17 winners he has a lead of five in The Herald Scottish Trainers'
Championship.
Alistair Whillans, the leading permit holder, also is on a winning
streak.
Water Baron, 12-1, a #3600 purchase at Doncaster in November, on his
first run took the juvenile hurdle.
''I thought he might just need the race,'' said Whillans, now on five
winners, one less than last season.
Ask Me Later, trained by Sue Bradburne, won the amateur's hurdle,
while Jim Goldie was successful with Nicholas Plant in the Fisherton
Hurdle.

THE Mitsubishi world championship team, managed by Berwickshire's
Andrew Cowan, trounced the opposition on the Swedish International
Rally, taking first and second places.
Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson, driving a Lancer, was first over the finish
ramp in Karlstad yesterday with his team mate Tommi Makinen from Finland
only 12 seconds behind.
In a bizarre ending, Makinen parked his Lancer 500 metres from the end
of the final special stage, allowing Eriksson to win. Cowan explained
this tactic had been planned on Saturday night after both drivers agreed
it would be foolish to continue racing each other in the worsening
weather conditions.
Mitsubishi's resounding victory on the second round the World
Championship, has promoted 30-year-old Makinen into the lead of the
drivers' championship and the Rugby-based team to first place in the
manufacturers' category.
Last year's winner Thomas Radstrom was third, Finland's Juha Kankkunen
fourth, and defending world champion Didier Auriol fifth. All three were
driving Toyota Celica's.
Lanark's Colin McRae and his Swedish team-mate Mats Jonsson were
unable to restart when their Subaru Impreza suffered oil leaks while
parked on the overnight Parc Ferme. At the end of Saturday's second leg
McRae was fourth overall. Results:
1, K Eriksson/S Parmander (Sweden), Mitsubishi Lancer, 4 hours 51min
27sec; 2, T Makinen/S Harjanne (Finland), Lancer, 4-51-39; 3, T
Radstrom/L Backman (Sweden), Toyota Celica, 4-52-34; 4, J Kankkunen/N
Grist (Finland, Britain), Celica, 4-53-45; 5, D Auriol/B Occelli
(France), Celica, 4-53-47. World Rally Championship for drivers after
two rounds: 1, T Makinen 25 pts; 2, J Kankkunen 22 pts: 3, K Eriksson 20
pts.

* THIS year's Burmah Scottish Rally Championship started with a bang
and ended with one of the closest finishes on record. After 45 miles
over snow-covered, slippery forest roads, David Gillanders won the
Mercury Snowman Rally on Saturday by just two seconds from Chris Wagner.
Going into the final stage, five seconds separated the leaders and
Gillanders thought he had blown it when his Ford Escort Cosworth hit a
patch of ice and spun at 100 mph, but fortunately for him, Wagner's bid
for victory in his Audi 90 Quattro hit similar problems.
Wagner's spins were not quite as lurid but they were more frequent and
he later admitted that he ''never wanted to drive that fast, on those
surfaces, ever again!''
But it was Callum Guy who opened the scoring. He was fastest on the
first special stage and then promptly fell victim to an ice-covered
downhill stretch into a left hand bend. His Toyota Celica didn't
actually crash, it slithered over the edge of the road and simply rolled
over on to its roof.
He wasn't the only one. Former Scottish champion and top seed Raymond
Munro slid into a ditch at the same place and they were followed in
quick succession by virtually the whole 80-car entry.
It was certainly a day of changing fortunes. At the half way point
John Gray wasn't even in the top ten but over the closing stages he
rocketed back into contention and finished the day third ,just 12
seconds behind Wagner.
Gordon Boyd finished fourth, George Gauld was fifth after a slow
start, and Jimmy Paterson fulfilled expectations with his first
appearance in a competitive machine rounding off the top half dozen.
1, David Gillanders/Bob Wilson (Ford Escort Cosworth) 51 mins 16 secs;
2, Chris Wagner/Alan Stark (Audi 90 Quattro) 51:18; 3, John Gray/Fergus
Loudon (MG Metro 6R4) 51:30; 4, Gordon Boyd/Fred Bell (Ford Escort
Cosworth) 52:30; 5, George Gauld/Roy Campbell (Ford Escort Cosworth)

SEVEN years ago Keith Anderson could not tie his shoe laces without
getting out of breath. Yesterday, at the age of 37, he left the whole of
Scotland gasping in his wake as he claimed the national senior men's
cross-country title on the North Inch, Perth.
Anderson, on his Cambuslang debut, led his new club to a record eighth
successive team victory, ahead of the favoured Leslie Deans Racing Club,
who, disappointingly, did not stay to collect their medals.
The oldest winner since 1948, Anderson broke clear in the final mile,
finishing in 41min.08sec, 21 seconds clear of the defending champion,
Spango Valley's Chris Robison, with Cambuslang's Graeme Croll third.
Remarkably, Anderson had taken the British Universities' championship
seven days earlier, and this time he saw off a field which contained
three former champions -- Commonwealth Games finallist Robison, Olympic
steeplechase finallist Tom Hanlon, who dropped out for the second
successive year, and three-time champion Tom Murray, who placed fourth.
A mature student at Stafford University, but son of a Scottish father,
Anderson spent 15 years in Glasgow, and his schooldays at Smithycroft
school in Dennistoun. Two years ago he pointed out his nationality to
the Scottish Athletic Federation, but despite his credentials as a
former British fell-running champion, and significant road form, he was
never given a Scottish vest.
''I looked on myself as Scottish, but when England came along and
offered me international selection at 36, I thought I'd better grab the
chance,'' he said. ''It was a ridiculous situation. I'd have preferred
to be Scottish.''
The first six to finish are due to represent Scotland in the world
championship trial at Morpeth on March 5. A seventh will be chosen by
the selectors today. But Anderson cannot be among them.
Now there will be the unique situation of Anderson, a Scot, running
for England, and runner-up Robison, England-born, representing Scotland.
The 38-year-old John Robson, 1978 Commonwealth Games medallist at
1500m, ran outstandingly, sixth, for Racing Club, but is uncertain about
accepting a world trial place. ''I hate cross-country,'' said the man
once ranked fifth in the world at the event. ''They should try younger
guys.''
The extra place in the team of seven is likely to go to Robert Quinn,
who pulled out with a viral infection -- though Alan Puckrin, similarly
afflicted, has claims.
Cambuslang packed their six counting runners into the first 17 places.
Alex Robertson finished nineteenth for the Lanarkshire men, surely the
highest placed runner from a winning club not to feature in the medals.
And on a glorious day, they won the team title in every age group,
except under-20, in which they placed third.
''I remember as a boy being inspired by watching Lachie Stewart
winning at the Commonwealth Games,'' said Anderson, a former chef. ''But
I never even ran, far less gave a thought to winning a title which he
once held.
''I had trouble tieing my shoe laces when I was 30. That's when I
started running. My wife went on a diet, and I stepped on the scales. I
was 13[1/2]st, and it frightened me.''
Cambuslang gave up their place in the European Club's championships
which also took place yesterday -- a right earned by last year's
success. But club official Dave Cooney warned: ''We will not defend the
Scottish title next year if there is a fixture clash. We asked the
Scottish federation to do something about it, but they did not, and our
club lost out on the trip. It will not happen again.''
Vikki McPherson, the Commonwealth Games team captain from City of
Glasgow, won the women's title for the third time in four years, leading
her club to victory in the team event. Shettleston, the defending
champions, were third.
McPherson beat American exchange medical student Liz Riley, of Metro
Aberdeen, by 17 seconds, with last year's winner, Sue Ridley, third.
Accountant McPherson now hopes to make the British team for the world
event for the fourth successive year.

PAUL Weir's dream of a fight with ''Baby'' Jake Matlala for the World
Boxing Organisation flyweight championship lay in ruins in Pretoria on
Saturday night when the little South African lost his crown to Mexico's
Alberto Jiminez on an eighth-round stoppage.
Weir, the WBO light-flyweight champion and former straw-weight title
holder from Irvine, had his sights set on Matlala and a record-breaking
third world title, but as he watched the action along with his manager
Tommy Gilmour, all the plans were wrecked.
Matlala, who took the title from Weir's stablemate, Pat Clinton, gave
his usual gutsy effort, but the 34-year-old found the Mexican, nine
years his junior, too hot a handful. Jiminez comfortably soaked up heavy
pressure from the champion, then poured on plenty of his own.
The end, however, came in dramatic fashion. Midway through the eighth
round, Jiminez caught Matlala with a vicious right hook to the body and
followed up with a heavy combination to the head. The champion slumped
to one knee and the Californian referee immediately called a halt, much
to the anger of the capacity crowd.
It was later revealed that Matlala had been suffering from a
''stomache ailment'' and that a fortnight before the bout, he had been
in hospital for treatment.
Weir will, of course, retain his ambition of winning world titles at
three different weights, but instead of a showdown with Matlala, he will
now almost certainly concentrate on a defence of his light-fly title
within the next couple of months.
On the same bill as Matlala, Scots-born Gary Murray outpointed
London's Ojay Abrahams in a bizarre eight-rounder which saw Abrahams
open a gash under Murray's left eye with a head butt in the opening
stages. The Londoner, who did not win a round on any of the judges
scorecards, was down twice for counts of seven, and, in the fifth, when
he looked certain to be stopped, the bell signalling the end of the
round rang almost a minute early.
This was supposed to be a simple warm-up fight before Murray, who has
lived in South Africa since he was 16, meets Ireland's Eamonn Loughran
for the WBO welterweight title.
* COMMONWEALTH Games bantam gold medallist Paul Shepherd, from
Edinburgh, captains a depleted eight-man Scottish squad against England
at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London tonight, knowing it's 19 years
since our last success over the Auld Enemy. Scottish team:
Bantam: Shepherd, A Brennan (Barn). Feather: P Watson (Barn). Light: J
Coyle (Bannockburn). Light-welter: G Howatt (Lochee). Welter: C McNeil
(Springhill). Light-middle: J Gilhaney (Cleland), B Laidlaw (Cardenden).
* HENRY Maske, of Germany, retained his International Boxing
Federation (IBF) light-heavyweight title with a unanimous points
decision over Canada's Egerton Marcus in Frankfurt on Saturday.
* RASHID Johrie dispelled the well known myth that brains and brawn
don't mix when he completed the British and Scottish Universities
championship double within seven days.
Johrie, studying History at Strathclyde University, won the UK light
welterweight crown in London last week and on Saturday added the
domestic title to his list of honours at The Union, Glasgow. He defeated
Edinburgh psychology student Chris Byrne on a second-round stoppage,
having previously outpointed Glasgow's Roberto Bertoul. Results of other
finals:

SEVERIANO Ballesteros, having led from the first day until four holes
from the finish, lost the Canary Islands Open by one stroke to Jarmo
Sandelin after the little-known Swede had produced a miracle chip at the
fifteenth hole in Gran Canaria yesterday.
Sandelin, who is not even a household name in his native Stockholm,
had started the day two shots behind the Spaniard, fell six strokes
behind after only four holes, but had closed the gap to one when he
reached the 365-yard fifteenth.
Then, with Ballesteros recording a bogey 5 after driving into trees,
Sandelin produced his killer blow.
He had mis-hit his wedge to the green and was 60 feet from the flag in
two but then, to the astonishment and dismay of the pro-Spanish gallery,
the Swede chipped into the hole for a birdie 3 to take a one-shot lead.
He parred the last three to finish with a six-under aggregate of 282,
but Ballesteros, who had parred the sixteenth and seventeenth, still had
the chance of forcing a play-off when he splashed out of a bunker to
within six feet of the hole.
The Spaniard's putt drifted to the left of the hole, however, and the
27-year-old Sandelin had gained his first European Tour victory.
Sandelin, who had come into contention after shooting a course-record
66 in the third round, carries four wedges of different loft in his bag
and uses a longer-than-average driver.
After his win he said: ''It's unbelievable. I have beaten the great
hero in the last round. It's just great.
''I was six behind after I had double bogeyed the second and had
another at the fourth. But then I had three successive birdies and that
put me back in the race.''
Sandelin thought his birdie 2 at the difficult short eighth, where
Ballesteros had the first of three bogeys, was a key shot but he
admitted he had been very fortunate in chipping in at the fifteenth with
his No.9 iron.
''I had played a bad second shot and you have to be lucky. But this
was my week and that is why the ball went into the hole. I was also
lucky when Seve missed that last putt. I thought he would make it, and
he would have been very hard to beat in a play-off.''
Ballesteros, who had been hoping to gain his fifty-fourth European
Tour victory said: ''It's more difficult for me to win this event than
the US Masters. The greens were so difficult, but Sandelin did not make
any mistakes in the last 14 holes, so good luck to him.''
Paul Eales, who had finished 15 minutes earlier than Sandelin and
Ballesteros, earned joint second place when he birdied the last for 283.
Sweden's Anders Forsbrand also shot 71 to finish fourth on 284, with
Irishman Darren Clarke, German Sven Struver and Gary Emerson of
Salisbury joint fifth on 285.
Helensburgh-born Gary Orr was top Scot in joint eight place on
level-par 288 after a closing 74. He was four under par and three off
the pace with nine holes to play, but dropped four shots on his inward
nine. Two behind were fellow-Scots Brian Marchbank (72) and Paul Lawrie
(73).

RONNIE O'Sullivan won the Benson and Hedges Masters title at Wembley
Conference Centre yesterday, running out a 9-3 winner in the final
against fellow snooker prodigy John Higgins.
The 19-year-olds were the youngest players to contest a major final
but it was the Essex youngster who headed towards the #120,000 winner's
cheque by taking a 5-2 first-session lead.
Higgins, who had wins of 5-0 and 5-4 over his rival this season,
pottedfrom brown to pink to win the opening frame. He was set for a 2-0
lead when, having made a 48 break, he led 50-16, but the wild-card entry
from Wishaw suffered a ''kick'' and jawed a red to a middle pocket.
''That was the turning point,'' he said. ''When Ronnie gets on a role,
he's the hardest player in the world to stop. He wins frames so
quickly.''
O'Sullivan put together a 47 clearance to the pink, including a
spectacular shot from brown to blue, and thus embarked on a five-frame
sequence, with further breaks of 68, 53, and 82.
In an error-strewn seventh frame Higgins constructed a run of 73 to
end the session at 2-5 but last night O'Sullivan had runs of 55, 41, and
46 as he moved to 7-2. The Scot compiled a 91 in the tenth frame but
breaks of 33, 34, and 57 in the following two frames earned O'Sullivan
his fourth professional title.
O'Sullivan, who takes over from five-times Masters champion Stephen
Hendry as the youngest winner of the event, said: ''I'm still not happy
with my game.
''I hope people don't get offended with what I say but I'm still
searching for the missing part and, when it arrives I think I can win
tournament after tournament.
''I know I can win the world title easily. For me there's Hendry,
John, and myself, and the rest are struggling.''
The Scot is the first wild-card to reach the Masters final and was
consoled by a #63,000 cheque as runner-up.

TWO things of consequence have reared their heads this weekend. The
first I found out about at the Antrim Gala dinner in Northern Ireland.
I sat beside Reg Reilly, the Ulster representative on the IRFB. ''It's
a tragedy, isn't it,'' he said, ''that the Irish have called off from
next season's Inter Provincial Championship.''
''You what?'' I stammered. This competition is the flagship of the way
ahead, a bridge between club and district.
''You didn't know?'' he went on. ''The IRFB don't think it's
worthwhile, and so the thing is off. I think it's a tragedy. We will
contact the Scottish Districts to try to play some friendly games.''
Fraser Livingston, Secretary of the Glasgow and District Union,
confirmed the news yesterday, which is a big blow to Jim Telfer's plans
for Scottish rugby's future.
''It's not official, but, yes, we have been informed that the Irish do
not want to be part of the full-scale series of matches,'' Livingston
said.
''However, like Ulster, we are keen to keep playing the Irish
regularly at District level. We think it would be good for both of us.''
I understand that Glasgow are considering the possibility of a
Friendship Cup with Ulster, a move that would delight the Northern
Irish. Reilly said: ''We would welcome that.''
Andy Little, the Glasgow representative on the SRU, said: ''I'm sad it
has come to this. The players liked the games, and already the Irish
Provinces have contacted some of our Districts.
''We thought it was valuable; the negative side came from high up the
Irish tree.''
This is huge news. But let me give them a tip. If the Districts are to
go ahead with some form of competition with the Irish, then make sure
two things happen.
First, get a sponsor. A Murphy's Cup or similar between Ulster and
Glasgow would make a big difference from some unimportant game in front
of nobody. Second, give the thing a tangible prize, or it will never
take off.
THE second bit of news came with a little video package delivered to
suburban Jordanhill on Saturday morning. It contained an uncut version
of Thursday's BBC Scotland's documentary For Love and Money? -- which
highlights the differences between Melrose and the Toulouse club in
France -- as part of the 700-year Auld Alliance.
Melrose is run by a body of people who do it for nothing, as do the
players. Stade Toulousain, winners of France's championship last season,
have a full-time staff, and run a work experience scheme with players
who are tied to one of the sponsors.
The bombshell of the piece is that one of their senior players,
Patrick Soula, is to be pictured on camera saying: ''I don't mind
telling you that an average player gets 5000 francs a month (#625) plus
a match win bonus of about 1000 francs (#125).
''All the clubs in the First Division and below get payment. We really
count on match bonuses.''
Toulouse club president, Rene Bouscatel, says: ''We have a fixed
monthly amount which covers all the time the players lose through rugby,
and a bonus scheme based on match results.''
Bouscatel goes on: ''There are certain players at certain clubs who
are earning 'way beyond what can be considered appropriate amateur
status.''
In many ways the documentary is an old chew of every accusation ever
levelled at the different approaches from different countries when it
comes to professionalism.
It combines ex-players whingeing about how they weren't paid in their
day to clever cutting to make the SRU look quite silly.
What it does, emphatically too, is prove, on camera and in interview,
that the French admit paying their players healthy money at club level.
It raises a question. As you know, it's against the rules. The French
admit on telly to having broken the rules. Therefore they shouldn't be
allowed to play. What do we do now? Call off from Saturday's game? I
think, chaps, that we should.  Answers on a postcard please . . .

San Diego
PETER Jacobsen almost certainly booked a place for himself in the 1995
US Ryder Cup side to defend the trophy in upstate New York in the autumn
when he won the Buick Invitational by four strokes with a final 68 on
the 7000-yard Torrey Pines South course in California yesterday.
It was Jacobsen's second win in succession, for he triumphed
unexpectedly at Pebble Beach last week -- after not having won a
tournament since the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in 1990.
The 41-year-old professional, who has been noted more for his
television commentating than his stroke play in the last few seasons,
again played some inspired golf, albeit in a weaker field this week, to
leave a group of four, who included Mark Calcaveccia and Hal Sutton,
gasping behind him.
He became the first professional to win two events in a row since
1993, when Zimbabwean Nick Price, and later South African David Frost,
did so.
In contrast to many professionals, who take their victories either too
seriously or too tearfully, Jacobsen is a cheery fellow who not only
impersonates many of the world stars with an uncanny touch, but runs his
own television company as well as occasionally joining other players in
a Pop group called, Jake Trout and the Flounders.
He made the crowd roar with laughter after he had birdied the last
hole, as he had done at Pebble Beach.
Jacobsen threw the ball high into the stands and, then picking up his
wife, stalked purposefully towards the nearby lake as if to dunk her, or
both of them, into the water.
Something Mrs Jacobsen whispered in his ear made him desist, but he
carried her off the green like a proud bridegroom hoisting a pretty
bride over the threshold.
Nick Faldo, who missed the cut by a single stroke on Friday night --
he missed several tap-in putts in another 71 -- and then flew off
directly to Florida to have a fortnight's break with his family, could
well have something to learn from Jacobsen's attitude.
But the Briton has his mind full with his putting problems at the
moment. Final scores:
269 -- P Jacobsen 68, 69, 68, 68.
273 -- M Calcaveccia 71, 67, 67, 68; H Sutton 67, 69, #8, 69; K
Triplett 69, 69, 66, 69; M Hulbert 70, 65, 70, 68.
275 -- D Pohl 65, 74, 66, 70; D Pruitt 69, 70, 68, 68.
276 -- D Ogrin 66, 69, 74, 67; N Henke 68, 66, 73, 69; J Huston 69,
71, 67, 69; B Chamblee 66, 66, 74, 70.
Others included:
277 -- C Stadler 69, 68, 72, 69; D Love 69, 71, 72, 65.
278 -- P Mickelson 65, 69, 75, 69; C Beck 70, 70, 71, 67; P Stewart
66, 70, 67, 72.
281 -- T Kite 75, 66, 67, 73; J Parnevik (Sweden) 72, 64, 74, 71.
Failed to qualify: 142 -- N Faldo (England) 71, 71. 146 -- D Feherty
(N Ireland) 69, 77.

JOHN Regis accepted the sponsor's flowers, reward for 200 metres
victory in Britain's athletics international against France on Saturday,
but he awarded no bouquets himself.
Despite slicing seven hundredths of a second from his own Scottish
all-comers' record, with a time of 20.67sec, he gave none of the credit
to the Kelvin Hall track.
''The banking is too steep for speed,'' he growled from behind a new
Fu Manchu-style beard. ''It's hard to attack the bends, hard to get your
feet.'' But for one who dislikes the surface, he is adept at burying his
prejudices, for he has flourished in Glasgow.
His performance at the Interflora international was his fourth
Scottish all-comers' best at this distance in four years (plus a share
of the world 4 x 200m record, in 1991) and it helped Britain to overall
victory by 155 points to 122.
But despite breath-taking wins by stars such as Linford Christie,
Colin Jackson, and Tom McKean, it is Regis who warms the heart most this
winter. For each of the others declines to run the World Indoor
championships next month in Barcelona, whereas Regis has the date
indelibly in his diary. He is convinced he is in shape to break the
world record, hence his up-tight jibes at Glasgow's bends.
He believes he can dominate the event indoors and out this year, and
that the world mark can be his in Lievin, France, next weekend, when he
faces Commonwealth champion, Frankie Fredericks.
But he might have been less effusive had he realised that the time of
20.47, which he ran last weekend, and which he believes is a British
record, cannot be ratified. There were just two men in the race, and
British rules (141, 17) require a minimum of three runners.
His latest record was just one of eight established on Saturday,
although five were set in the pole vault alone. Catherine Oberson and
Kate Staples nudged up the all-comers' mark five times before Gladiator
Staples won at 3.60 metres, her twenty-seventh record in the event.
As Jackson held off Tony Jarrett in 7.39, the world's fastest time of
the year, Jarrett equalled his English native best with 7.44. Jackson,
who is off to train in Australia tomorrow, clocked 7.39 yesterday in
Karlsruhe, but suffered slight hamstring damage.
His coach, Malcolm Arnold, said: ''Colin is running incredibly well --
less than a tenth of a second from the world record, yet he is still
lifting heavy weights three times a week.''
Christie, who won the 60m in 6.56, also confessed to be working with
heavier weights than in recent winters, and indicated progress, even at
34, which suggests that the world record which would crown his career,
is within his grasp.
''I'm lighter than last year, but lifting heavier weights,'' he said.
''That means I am stronger, and that helps you race faster. My coach,
Ron Roddan, has his ideas and I have mine. I tend to keep mine to
myself. But I don't discount going faster.''
The UK selectors' deficiencies were exposed by Arbroath 1500m runner
Ian Campbell. Omitted from the team, despite being UK fastest this year
by more than five seconds, he ran as a guest, smashing his own Scottish
native record by almost two seconds with 3min 43.53sec.
He was the only man to challenge Eric Dubus, fourth in last year's
European outdoor championships, but the effort drained him, and he was
nailed on the line by the UK No.1, Ian Grime, who had been content to
lie back. Clydesdale's Grant Graham finished fourth but slashed four
seconds from his best.
Despite maintaining this winter's 100% record, McKean remains adamant
that he will not defend his world crown. He survived a blistering
challenge from Martin Steele, and also buried last summer's leading
outdoor Briton, Craig Winrow, winning in 1-48.72.
Mel Neef preserved her unbeaten indoor 400m record -- she has not lost
on the boards since taking up the event last year. But she was pushed
all the way, winning by just 0.04sec, in 53.67.
She withdrew from the relay, with a tight calf muscle, but is
confident she will be right within days. She races Sally Gunnell a week
on Saturday, and whatever the outcome can be sure of a world team place.
Troon's Brian Whittle, beaten into third in the men's individual 400m
by teenage AAA champion Mark Hylton, came back to anchor the relay team
to victory. Winners and leading Britons:

TOMMY Burns has been to the place where real football players are made
and the Celtic manager, who is determined to glean as much knowledge as
possible before laying the foundations which he believes will make his
club a power again, intends now to speak with the one of the all-time
greats, Johan Cruyff.
Burns is not ashamed to admit he will absorb information or advice
from as many experienced managers and coaches as will give him their
time, and Barcelona will be one of the next stops on Burns' journey
towards greater footballing awareness.
Cruyff often can give the impression of being aloof and distant, but
that might simply be a side-effect of his greatness. He is still
regarded as the absolute genius of modern football and sometimes the
truly gifted can become weary of the ways of lesser people. His kind
often operate on a different frequency and tend to become slightly
insular.
It isn't that Cruyff is refusing to allow opponents a window on his
mind, but after a while he may have arrived at the concusion that there
is no further point in preaching a gospel which floats over the heads of
others because they are either unwilling or unable to comprehend the
message.
Burns' thirst for knowledge and understanding of the various
approaches to football will be accommodated by the former Dutch
internationalist, who has been told of the Celtic manager's interest in
his philosphy. If the schedules of both managers can accommodate a
meeting -- Cruyff's Catalan side malfunctioned badly on Saturday,
slumping to a 5-0 defeat by Racing Santander -- then Barcelona's leader
will meet Celtic's young manager, who only last week travelled to Ajax.
where Cruyff began the career which thrilled and inspired millions.
He was a player of natural ability and intelligence who performed with
balletic grace. Cruyff displayed an awareness way above the normal, the
sharpness of thought and clarity of vision which all of the world's best
players possessed.
Indeed, he became the finest example of the football modernists who
were the products of coaches like the Dutch innovator, Rinus Michels, a
deep thinker and schemer, who first presented total football in all its
glory to the world in the 70s.
The game should be forever grateful to the Dutch, who have never
stopped developing and refining their product, which is the reason their
players are in demand. A manager simply knows that when he buys a Dutch
footballer he is receiving someone whose understanding is widespread.
Dutch players tend to think a few moves ahead and they see the game as a
complete picture rather than an unmade jigsaw puzzle.
They also have greater technique than players from most other
countries and especially Britain, and Burns deserves credit for wishing
to examine closely what it is the Dutch are doing with their children.
Now he wants to go to the master himself.
Expansion, the need to question and experiment, is another attribute
of Holland's footballing people. They are always seeking ways of being
more expressive and are unafraid to stretch the boundaries of
convention. It was inevitable Burns would soon head in the direction of
the Dutch in search of knowledge.
A few years ago, after I had travelled to Holland to put together a
documentary for BBC on the differences between football as we know it
here and the European game, Burns, who was just starting out on his
managerial career with Kilmarnock, telephoned to remark on the
programme's value. The parts filmed at Ajax and one of the Dutch FA's
coaching schools intrigued him and it can be assumed safely that the
development programme he intends instituting at Celtic Park will be
influenced greatly by what he has learned in Holland.
Perhaps Cruyff's methods also can be adapted to suit and, if nothing
else, Burns is determined to give his club a youth development system
which will be the envy of everyone on this island. Having gone Dutch, he
is bound to be considering the possibility of introducing a scheme which
combines a youth's footballing needs with his education, something they
have been doing for years in the Netherlands.
Of course, Burns cannot afford to ignore the immediate problems
because supporters are concerned with what is happening now. They want
to see improvement on a Saturday afternoon and their desperation to
welcome a trophy to Celtic Park has been made even more acute because of
the team's failure in the Coca-Cola Cup final last November, when they
were beaten by Raith Rovers after a penalty shoot-out.
The Scottish Cup is the only shiny thing they can win this season and
if the players equal the resolve and boldness being displayed by Burns,
it would be foolish to write them off. On Saturday the manager took the
decision to drop his captain Paul McStay because he felt his style of
play was not appropriate.
Burns wanted to bring 20-year-old Brian McLaughlin back into the first
team and someone had to drop out. McStay discovered that Celtic's
manager will sacrifice anyone to find the correct playing system, one
which can add another dimension to the team's style.
Cruyff, who has dropped the player voted No.1 in the world, Romario,
and Bulgarian star Hristo Stoichkov in search of the perfect balance,
would have approved.
' Celtic seek a youth development system everyone will envy. '

THE capitulation of the opposition, allied to their own brilliance,
saw Edinburgh Ladies walk off with the women's Indoor Hockey League
title for the third successive year at the McTaggart Centre in Dundee on
Saturday, giving them the league and cup double for the first time and
setting them up nicely for the finals next weekend of the European club
championship.
Western Klick Photopoint and Bonagrass Grove simplified Edinburgh's
task by playing out a 3-3 draw in the penultimate match of the
championship, so Edinburgh had retained their crown before their final
match.
Edinburgh began the day displaying the form of champions, beating
Menzieshill 10-1 with Pauline Robertson emerging as their top scorer
with a hat trick. This performance clearly intimidated their rivals for
Western threw in the towel against Grove.
After getting back on level terms through a corner conversion by Mags
Barbour two minutes from time, goalkeeper Tracy Robb was brought back
for the closing stages, thus settling for a draw.
They obviously felt Edinburgh were beyond their reach and so it turned
out for the capital girls beat Hyndland 10-2 to complete their programme
with maximum points to finish three points clear of Western and Grove.
On this form Edinburgh can look with confidence to the Euro finals in
Russelsheim, Germany, where they could well improve on the bronze medals
won last year.
But Western, despite being relegated to a poor second, have a much
brighter future than many might envisage.
Their second string, playing as Clydesdale, won Pool B and will
compete in the top flight next season, creating a much broader base for
Western in the future. They secured their elevation by beating Royal
High Gymnasts 4-3 in the deciding game.
Indoor hockey is renowned for producing close finishes to games but
never before has a division of the league seen the top two sides so
easily matched as in Division Four on Saturday, at the end of their
campaign. Pender Uddingston and Hillhead finished equal on both points
and goal difference but Uddingston, having scored 118 goals to
Hillhead's 113, took the silverware. Results:

PLAYERS swapped shirts and fans were unusually subdued as Italy's
Serie A resumed normal service yesterday, two weeks after the murder of
a Genoa fan provoked the suspension of all national sport.
At grounds throughout the country, teams took the field wearing their
opponents' jerseys before their captains read a special message calling
on fans to unite against violence.
''Soccer should unite and not divide us,'' said Sampdoria captain
Roberto Mancini at the Ferraris stadium in Genoa, where 24-year-old
Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death on January 29.
At most grounds, fans displayed banners renouncing hooliganism, while
Genoa and Padua supporters stayed away from their teams' away fixtures
in Florence and Parma respectively.
Once back in their own playing strip, Juventus maintained their
three-point lead at the top of the table with a hard-fought 2-0 win at
Bari.

GLASGOW Mid Argyll's south division one shinty championship hopes
almost certainly perished on a rain-sodden Mossfield Park in Oban when
they went down 3-0 to reigning champions Oban Camanachd.
The 3-0 final scoreline flattered the champions. An early goal from
Stephen Jamieson and then a second against the run of play from David
Devine early in the second half, put them in an unassailable position.
Gus Campbell's third strike with four minutes remaining gave Camanachd
a comfortable two points which now leave them eight ahead of Mid Argyll
and Kyles, who have a game in hand.
Another weekend of dismal weather brought widespread postponements.
Two Glenmorangie Sutherland cup ties survived, however, and Fort
William made the most of their chance to complete a junior and senior
cup double when they inflicted a surprisingly easy defeat on Lochside
Rovers.
Rovers took an early lead through Cameron MacEachain, but an Ian
Kennedy double before half-time put Fort back in front. Andy Reid
provided a third to put Fort in the semi-finals.
The other tie was also in rain-drenched Lochaber with Kilmallie's
veterans proving too much for south opponents Strachur.
The two north sides now await the outcome of the two postponed ties
which are being re-scheduled for this Saturday. All four semi-finalists
could come from the north. Favourites Kingussie are liable to be too
strong for Oban Celtic and Beauly have home advantage against Inveraray.
Results:
Glenmorangie Sutherland Cup. Third round -- Fort William 3, Lochside
Rovers 1; Kilmallie 5, Strachur 0.
North. Marine Harvest league. Division three -- Skye 5, Glenurquhart
2. Division four -- Lochaber 4, Kincraig 0.
South. Marine Harvest league. Division one -- Oban Camanachd 3,
Glasgow Mid-Argyll 0. Division two -- Edinburgh University 0, Tayforth

THE contrast between the men's and women's finals yesterday in the
Scottish junior championships in Kilmarnock could not have been greater.
The lead changed five times in the women's event before Forfar's Julia
Ewart beat Catherine Wright (Stranraer) 10-8, while in the men's final,
six ends were blanked before Lockerbie's Tom Brewster beat defending
champion and club-mate Craig Wilson 3-2.
Ewart started the final well with a single on the first end, Wright
followed that with a 3, but the Forfar team came back with another
three.
At the sixth, Ewart scored 2to take a 7-4 lead that looked decisive,
but Wright's side fought back with 2s at the seventh and eighth ends to
regain the lead at 8-7.
Ewart's team showed fighting quality in the last two ends, scoring a
single at the ninth and then at the next to gain victory.
Tom Brewster set the tone for the men's final, choosing to blank the
first four ends. Brewster's patience paid off in the fifth when Craig
Wilson, who was trying to win the title for the third successive time,
was too heavy with his last stone, leaving Brewster with a
straightforward draw to score 2 and put his team in front.
Wilson then responded with a single at the next end. In the seventh,
Brewster returned to his blanking tactics, but in the next end, Wilson
stole another single to level the game at 2-2.
In the ninth end, Wilson had a stone at the rear of the house which
looked well guarded, but a well judged shot by Brewster took it out.
Following this, a hit-and-roll by Brewster blanked the end to let him
retain the last-stone advantage for the tenth end.
Wilson built up the head in the tenth and lay three with skip stones
still to be played. However, Craig Wilson's attempt to restore his front
guard with his last stone was too wide and too strong, leaving Brewster
with a double take-out for the title.
In this pressure situation, Brewster's stone was good enough to give
him one shot and the game at 3-2.

STRIKER Romario's first competitive game since returning to Brazilian
soccer from Spain turned into a flop yesterday when he failed to score
and was marked out of the game in Flamengo's drew 0-0 with Fluminense.
A crowd of nearly 99,000 turned out to watch Romario's proper debut
for Flamengo, whom he joined from Barcelona last month, in the Rio de
Janeiro championship game at the Maracana stadium.
But despite a delirious welcome from Flamengo fans, who threw ticker
tape and fireworks on to the pitch when Romario took the field, the
striker was outwitted and outmarked by his marker, Fluminense central
defender Lima.
Romario had only one shot on target in the 90 minutes and looked weary
and short of pace. During the first half, a fan ran on to the pitch and
hugged him. Romario led the fan to the touchline, where he was taken
away by police.
The Brazilian star had previously played in two friendly matches for
Flamengo but did not score in either game.

* WEST Indies inflicted the heaviest defeat ever on New Zealand when
they won the second Test by an innings and 322 runs before lunch on the
fourth day early today in Wellington, winning the two-match series 1-0.
The first Test was drawn.
Captain Courtney Walsh destroyed New Zealand's first innings yesterday
with his best Test performance of seven for 37, making the Kiwis follow
on a massive 444 runs behind.
Walsh then took six for 18 in the second innings and, not
surprisingly, was named man of the match after match figures of 13 for
55.
West Indies batsman Brian Lara, who hit 147 on Friday, is to undergo
eye surgery.
During his innings he was hit in the face by a bouncer from Danny
Morrison. Scores:
West Indies 660 for five, decl (B Lara 147, J Adams 151, J Murray 101
n.o.); New Zealand 216 (D Murray 52, S Fleming 47; C Walsh 7-37) and 122
(Walsh 6-18).

MICHAEL Atherton has defended the management of the England team in
the wake of the disappointing Ashes tour.
The England captain spoke of a lack of unity after the fifth Test
defeat in Perth and, earlier in the tour, appeared to hint at
differences of opinion with chairman of selectors Raymond Illingworth.
But speaking on BBC Breakfast with Frost yesterday, Atherton insisted
he was happy with the current set-up.
''I think the management structure's fine,'' he said. ''I'm very happy
with my role in selection at the moment.
''We have a five-man selection committee on which I have a vote, and
I'm perfectly happy with that.''
Atherton said he was misquoted over claims that he wanted a greater
say in selection, although he repeated his call for younger selectors.
Meanwhile, the bitter taste of defeat, their first in India, should
re-focus Allan Wells' England A team for the final fortnight of their
highly successful tour.
That is the opinion of both captain Wells and team manager Phil Neale
in the wake of Saturday's controversial six-run defeat in the opening
one-day international against India A at Indore.
Wells's side felt harshly treated by the umpires, who imposed a
one-over penalty for England's failure to bowl their 50 overs inside the
prescribed three-and-a-half-hour limit.
The umpires' decision meant England had left themselves only 49 overs
in which to score 202.
In the end, despite a brave chase, the final over began with 14 runs
still wanted, and that proved too tall an order for Paul Nixon and last
man Richard Stemp.
* WEST Indies captain Courtney Walsh destroyed New Zealand's first
innings with his best Test performance of seven for 37 and made the
Kiwis follow on a massive 444 runs behind on the third day of the second
Test in Wellington yesterday.
Walsh then bowled Young for a duck in the first over of the second
innings to collect his 250th Test wicket.
New Zealand got into even deeper trouble when Benjamin got Jones lbw
without scoring in the second over and Curtly Ambrose trapped Rutherford
lbw for four soon after.
By the close, the Kiwis were reeling at 52 for three and staring at
the most comprehensive defeat in their history.
West Indies batsman Brian Lara, who hit 147 on Friday, is to undergo
eye surgery. During his innings he was hit in the face by a bouncer from
Danny Morrison.

Boroughmuir 8, Edinburgh Academicals 9
SINGING in the rain were the Academicals; up the creek without a
paddle were the boys of Boroughmuir, their championship hopes swept away
in the tide. Yet how these differing emotions were realised has to be
one of the great mysteries of the season.
Let's not mess about -- Boroughmuir should have won. They had
possession galore thanks to the spring-heeled antics of Darren Burns and
Paul Jennings at the line-out. They had the smartest back on display in
Sean Lineen, the most deadly finisher in Derek Stark.
Yet the home team were not robbed. They stole the game from
themselves.
On a day when ducks scurried for shelter, Boroughmuir wanted to play
it wide. Occasionally they even shipped the ball about in their own 22.
This was akin to turkeys voting for Christmas.
The spectating Scotland 'A' coach Hugh Campbell mildly observed that
these tactics were ''a little naive.'' Jeremy Richardson, the Scotland
and Academicals lock, put an astute finger on it. ''They had no plan
B.''
The visitors, welcoming the deluge like farmers at the end of a
drought, had little time for such extravagances. They knew exactly what
they were trying to do and fly-half Brian Hay-Smith did it.
His left foot must have been tired as he punted with it so often,
turning the Boroughmuir defence again and again. It was repetitive, not
very spectacular -- and utterly effective. He was the man of the match
by a mile.
He needed some help, of course, and that was principally provided by
David McIvor and his beavering pack, for whom such conditions were sent
by the Gods. McIvor has fallen from international grace since the South
African debacle yet one feels he should be around somewhere just in case
the weather turns foul.
Rob Hoole and Martin Waite impressed me, the former a genuine
open-side flanker. ''Nailing them in the first tackle was important and
we did that well,'' said Richardson.
They did, indeed, and managed to pinch a lot of ruck ball in the
process. On the couple of occasions the ball went beyond Hay-Smith,
Chris Simmers was ready to show he possessed a break.
Peter Wright, with Paris in his sights, had a storming match for
Boroughmuir. He may have looked like a panda but his relish to have the
ball in his hands was refreshing.
But I was still puzzled why the home side did not change the orders of
the day. ''We lacked,'' commented Iwan Tukalo, one of the 'Muir injured
men, ''a bit of experience in the midfield.'' They missed him, all
right, and scrum-half Mike Hall even more.
Handling in a ruck provided the opportunity for Hay-Smith to kick the
opening penalty. Offside at the line-out brought the second.
In 20 minutes, however, we were served up a peach of a try. Home full
back Nick Mardon entered the line and lobbed a high pass to Stark.
The international winger, whose recall papers cannot be long in
arriving, caught the ball one-handed then cut inside, wrong-footing the
entire defence. He gave to Lineen who, according to Stark, ''has lost a
yard in pace''. Old Sean has not been told this; he skipped outside one
man and side-stepped another en route to the touchdown.
Hay-Smith resumed his goal-kicking duties on the half-hour before the
home forwards, Grant Wilson to the fore, set up a penalty chance for
Bryan Easson. He kicked it but not much else went well for the lad.
The second half was barren of scores. Lineen and Stark had collected
knocks by now and Boroughmuir were stuck in the swamp.
Tukalo told me he might be fit to play in a couple of weeks. ''But is
there much point?'' he posed. Academicals, however, have still much to
play for -- they want to make absolutely certain of a top division spot
next season.
Boroughmuir -- N Marden; D A Stark, S R P Lineen, D Laird, A Millar; B

AS a rugby writer -- even as a recently qualified one -- I am often
asked the question, will even spasmodic exposure to Rugby League damage
the health?
Usually the query comes at those cosy supper parties which those of us
in colleague James Traynor's ''rugby mob'' of lawyers, bankers, teachers
and accountants so much enjoy.
Whenever the question is posed I invariably answer that, like all
things, Rugby League taken in moderation will do little harm. I cannot
bring myself to go quite so far as Des Seabrook of the Lancashire rugby
union club Orrell, who observed that Rugby League was a simple game for
simple minds.
In rugby union there are any number of individual contests taking
place within the confines of a match. There are the scrummage front
rows. Which of them will come out on top in what remains one of the true
gladiatorial, head-to-head confontations in sport? There are the locks
who have their own personal duel in the lineout. Which of the opposing
scrumhalves will win the jousting that takes place at the base of the
scrummage? The back-rows, too, have their own private battles.
In the threequarter-line and on the wings there are one-on-one and
unit confrontations, and there can be few grander sights in sport than
that of a fullback bravely fielding opposition bombs or intruding into a
threequarter attack.
Undoubtedly, rugby union has become more sterile in recent years. But
what ball-game hasn't? The Andy Irvines and Jim Renwicks of the rugby
world are given scant opportunity in which to set the game alight these
days. But Union still has so much more to offer in the way of cranial
subtlety than the crash-bang-wallop of League.
The relative merits of League and Union take on a special significance
this year. It is 100 years since the great schism which saw the Northern
Union formed amid the bitter recriminations over ''broken-time
payments.''
All of which, with Union players currently cashing in on their
celebrity status and international players entitled to #40-a-day
''broken-time'' payments when on duty for their countries, is quite
risible.
Rugby League, rightly, looks on askance as global stars of the
''amateur'' Union game like David Campese of Australia seem to do quite
nicely out of their year-round endeavours.
Just the other week, for virtually the first time in a century, the
rugby league top brass, in the form of chief executive Maurice Lyndsay,
met the union International Board chairman Vernon Pugh. Cosy, but don't
hold your breath waiting for the great rapprochement communique. We
hear, too, that League is looking to Scoland with expansionist thoughts
in mind.
Count me out. Rugby Union has its faults but by comparison Rugby
League, with its ersatz scrummages, lack of lineouts, rucks, mauls and
its flanker-free zones is simple fare indeed. Maybe Seabrook had a
point.

Heriot's FP 9, Watsonians 15
WATSONIANS kept their title hopes burning bright amid the glaur and
gloom of a hopelessly mis-named Goldenacre, but they were made to work
for the right to maintain the challenge on Stirling County, especially
in the last quarter, when Heriot's heavier pack drove with telling, but
ultimately fruitless, effect.
The Myresiders remain just two points behind Stirling with just a
couple of games still to play. But the Bridgehaugh club, aiming for
their first championship in its 50-year history, has a postponed game in
hand, and Saturday's defeat of Boroughmuir by Edinburgh Academicals has
effectively turned the McEwan's 70/- title chase into a two-horse
affair.
Boroughmuir, though, still have a telling hand to play and their
encounter with Stirling at Bridgehaugh on Saturday week will be one of
the most enthralling clashes of the season.
On Saturday, Watsonians were without Gavin Hastings. The Scotland full
back had been advised to rest his war-weary back in advance of the Five
Nations' Championship trip to Paris. But even without him 'Sonians were
able to rise above the miserable conditions and score two tries to
Heriot's none.
Watsonians took the lead after 17 minutes following a series of drives
by the pack. The monsoon conditions, which contributed to a high
turnover rate, threatened to work to their disadvantage when Heriot's
winger Harry Gilmour seemed likely to break away from deep inside his
own half, but he was recalled for an off-side offence, and Duncan Hodge
made light work of a tricky penalty attempt.
Peter Hewitt kicked Heriot's back on level terms a short while later
with a penalty effort, and on the half-hour mark he put the home side
into the lead with a second successful penalty.
Three minutes later Watsonians' eager threequarters flew in the face
of muddy convention by spreading the ball wide, and Hodge, Henderson and
Kerr each played a part before Graeme Ingles squeezed over for a try at
the left corner flag.
Honours had been relatively even in a rain-soaked first half but, on
the stroke of half-time, Watsonians landed a psychologically significant
blow when Hodge went over for a short-range try, the ball having been
popped up by Weston from a ruck on the Heriot's line. He made it 15-6 at
the interval with the conversion of his own try.
Heriot's opted for a change of tactics at the start of the second
half. The conditions had negated earlier plans for their back-row, led
by Graham Dall, to play a leading role, and they opted instead for a
short-yardage game in which Scotland hooker Kenny Milne came into his
own.
After six minutes the new game plan almost paid dividends, when the
unmarked Peter Hewitt was handed a copper-bottomed scoring chance, but
the unforced error of a knock-on merely left the Heriot's winger staring
accusingly at his hands.
Hodge missed with a penalty attempt five minutes later, and for
virtually 20 minutes Watsonians were never out of the Heriot's half.
However, territorial domination was not turned into points and for the
final 20 minutes Watsonians were forced to weather not just the storm
but a fusillade of Heriot's raids on their line.
Gordon Lawrie was recalled by the referee for obstruction as he seemed
certain to score and Andy McRobbie was denied a try only by heroic cover
tackling at the corner flag.
Hewitt kicked his third penalty goal 10 minutes from the end, and
thereafter Watsonians were forced to endure a major onslaught. Three
times within as many minutes the home side eschewed penalty awards on
the visitors' line as they opted to scrummage for the try, and three
times Watsonians kept their line and their championship aspirations
intact.
Later, Watsonians coach Peter Gallagher praised his side for the
manner in which they had absorbed Heriot's last quarter push. ''They
made things very difficult for us with their driving around rucks and
mauls. They sucked us in and denied us the opportunities to play the
expansive game that we were after even in the conditions,'' he said.
The absent Hastings is a strong advocate of summer rugby and
Saturday's proceedings lent soggy weight to his case. Gallagher agrees:
''Sometimes it was so muddy that it was difficult for the players to
recognise each other. I've never seen Goldenacre looking so bad. There's
certainly a case to be made for fine weather rugby.''
In so far as Watsonians's title hopes are concerned, and with West of
Scotland and Dundee HS FP still to come, Gallagher is confident that his
side can take Stirling to the wire. ''It's still there to play for and
the challenge is still on,'' he declared.
Heriot's FP -- C R Aitken; H R Gilmour, A R McRobbie, G H Lawrie, P J

GHK 17, Hawick 17
''THAT was robbery -- and we were the bandits.'' Hawick coach Bill
Murray could not have been more honest in his assessment of the dramatic
draw at Old Anniesland.
Hawick were 17-6 behind after 50 minutes but a minute into injury time
got a try that levelled the scores and left both clubs still teetering
on the fringe of next season's eight-team Premier Division.
Murray continued: ''We looked dead and buried but all credit to the
lads, they kept plugging away, and GHK made the simple errors we had
committed in the first half and we cashed in.''
Brian Gilbert, the GHK coach, more or less reiterated those sentiments
by saying: ''I think we took our foot off the accelerator a bit early.
Scott Welsh's conversion attempt to win the match was not so very far
off target. If it had gone over there would have been a few suicides
around here.''
Even when Welsh put Hawick ahead with a seventh minute penalty, GHK
always looked the more dangerous and leapt into the lead three minutes
later when awarded a penalty try after Peterson was impeded after
charging down a clearance kick. George Breckenridge converted but Welsh
pulled back three points with a penalty.
Further power play by GHK's pack put Alan Watt over to give his side a
12-6 interval lead.
GHK began where they left off and Iain McDiarmid plunged over but
there ended the GHK dominance and Hawick clawed back with two Welsh
penalties and that dramatic injury time try from Cameron Murray.
GHK -- G Breckenridge; G Agnew, T Sanderson, I McDiarmid, G Hawkes; S
Hirini, C Little; A Watt, G Peterson, G MacIlwham, D Mellor, K Wilson, W
Malcolm, C Brown, M Wallace. Replacement -- M Blackie (for Peterson,
59min).
Hawick -- G Oliver; C Murray, D Grant, T Stanger, G Sharp; S Welsh, K
Reid; M Russell, J Hay, K Scott, S Henderson, D Turnbull, J Graham, B
Renwick, D McGuinness.
Referee -- I Ramage (Berwick).

West of Scotland 13, Melrose 26
THE enthusiasm of those who follow West of Scotland is infectious. By
the middle of Saturday evening they could have convinced anyone that
they will remain in Division One next year.
Perhaps the reality will be somewhat different, but what if for sure
is that if this game against Melrose was the final straw then they went
down fighting.
To score two tries in the final quarter and make what may have
appeared a pasting into something rather different showed a depth of
spirit which will stand West in good stead in whichever division they
find themselves.
They can boast an excellent half back pairing in Fraser Stott and
David Barrett, and the back row trio of David McVey, David McLeish, and
John Shaw caught the eye in both attack and defence.
Melrose, on the other hand, continue their up and down season looking
at times like the mean machine of old and at others rather fragile.
Jim Telfer was typically frank in his summary of events as the gloom
gathered over a damp Burnbrae: ''That was not very good.
''They should have had a lot more and faded quite a bit towards the
end.''
It had seemed in the early stages like just a matter of time before
West defences were breached but they held firm until three minutes
before half time.
Gary Parker had slotted two penalties in reply to Barrett's single
penalty when Ian Leighton intruded between the centres for a well-taken
try which Parker converted.
Once the scoreboard boys had got their act together, we realised it
was 3-13 and all to play for.
Although Melrose had all the options in the line out, with the height
and bulk of Robbie Brown, Ewan Simpson, and Doddie Weir, their
possession was rather scrappy.
Within five minutes of the restart, though, they had stretched the
lead when Gary Parker crossed for a try born of Craig Chalmers' break
and Ross Brown's link.
The irrepresible Parker converted then added two further penalties for
a 21 point haul with which he declared himself well pleased.
West were not finished, though, and the eager Stuart Munro, who had
replaced Mark Craig just minutes earlier, finished off a fine spell of
West pressure with a try.
McVey and Shaw were in the van of a continuing fightback just two
minutes from time -- as referee Leslie struggled with a damp pea in his
whistle -- and it led to a try for Chris Hart after Munro had charged to
the line.
Full marks to West for effort, although some punch is needed in the
midfield if real success is to follow, but Melrose are some way off
their best and Doddie Weir looks well out of place at blindside flanker.
West of Scotland -- A Williamson; M J Craig, D R McKee, C Hart, A
Hogarth; D N Barrett, F H Stott; P Wong, S Blair, A Crear, S Campbell, G
C Perrett, D A McVey, D McLeish, J Shaw. Replacement: S Munro for Craig
(57min).
Melrose -- I Leighton; C A Joiner, R N C Brown, A G Shiel, G A Parker;
C M Chalmers, B W Redpath; M G Browne, S Scott, D Lunn, R R Brown, E M
Simpson, G W Weir, S A Aitken, A J Kerr.

Gala 14, Jed-Forest 13
HISTORY books speak of Jethart Justice when Borders Rievers were
hanged first and tried later. But there was no justice for Jed-Forest in
a gripping game at Netherdale, where Gala repelled the raiders with two
late penalty goals from Gregor Townsend.
Gala coach Peter Dods openly admitted his side did not really deserve
the points, but that was little consolation to Jed, whose commitment and
spirit was total.
''We got out of jail,'' said Dods. The Jed forwards dominated, with
the back row of Kevin Armstrong, Ronnie Kirkpatrick, and Calum Brown
outstanding, and they also cleaned up the line-out.
It was not a day for running rugby on a heavy pitch, and yet it was an
inspirational break from Townsend which set up Chris Dalglish for the
Gala try on the stroke of half-time. The stand-off had to take over the
kicking duties when Michael Dods, who had put Gala ahead with a penalty,
hirpled off with a knee injury. Dods went to see the SRU doctor
yesterday at Murrayfield and could be out of action for several weeks.
However, Jed's response was to steal Gala line-out ball on the home
line and good control and the pick-up by Armstrong produced the try. A
penalty by Chris Richards early in the second half and a try from
Kirkpatrick put Jed in the driving seat until Townsend, under pressure,
showed a calm head and boot.
Defeat has almost certainly dumped Jed into division two next season,
but Gala are not safe either. ''We still have a lot of work to do,''
said Dods.
Gala -- M Dods; M Moncrieff, G Bayley, B Swan, C Dalglish; G Townsend,
G Farquharson; G Isaac, I Corcoran, H Hunter, R Hogg, G Paxton, M
Ballantyne, T Weir, J Amos. Replacement: D Changleng for Dods (35min).
Jed-Forest -- C Richards; K Amos, A Douglas, H Hogg, M Yule; G Scott,
G Renwick; N McIlroy, K Barrie, R Johnstone, R Murrow, C Hynd, K
Armstrong, R Kirkpatrick, C Brown.
Referee -- J Bacigalupo (Edinburgh Wanderers).

Stewart's-Melville FP 13, Stirling County 27
THE sheer grinding, burrowing power of the battle hardened Stirling
County forwards in rolling or driving their mauls proved the most
influential factor in a full hearted contest, brilliantly refereed by
Jim Fleming, and in which the swamped conditions at Inverleith mitigated
against the open style that is the Stewart's-Melville FP hallmark.
Stirling are indeed fortunate that they can afford to leave on the
bench a loose forward of the high quality of Gordon Mackay, but even he
must have felt some frustration at the sight of Gareth Flockhart giving
an outstanding performance, whether going forward or on retreat, capped
by the clinching try.
The College scrummage held its own, Ben Gordon did especially well at
the shorter line-out throws and Willie Faulds of the big leap had a rare
duel with Malcolm Norval.
Finlay Calder still has classy little touches in his locker and Alan
Kittle made several rollicking sorties, but the College pack seldom
matched their rivals in the close quarter exchanges where Kevin McKenzie
so often was the reactivator, Stewart Hamilton, streetwise and crafty,
Jim Brough excelling in scrummage ball control and Brian Ireland
providing yet another example of his total commitment to unglamorous
chores.
Mark McKenzie's assessment of what was on and what wasn't proved
fairly accurate and, despite the atrocious underfoot conditions, he gave
an admirable display of goal kicking with five penalty goals which took
Stirling to 15-6 after 51 minutes, then the conversion of the opening
try by Colin McRobert.
It was symptomatic of the difficulties the College backs experienced
in moving by hand a ball eventually like an orange pip that a breakdown
at Danny Bull enabled Mark McKenzie to hack the loose ball and McRobert
to do the same and then use his electrifying pace to stay ahead of the
pursuit for the try.
The tidy skills of Matt McGrandles complemented the power work of Ian
Jardine, Ken Harper mixed his game cleverly and Angus Turner is an
accomplished wing.
The Colleges backs might have prospered more had their forward
colleagues excelled in ball retention instead of occasionally having
ball stolen by worldly wise opponents of impressive upper body strength.
Mark McKenzie's conversion of McRobert's try gave Stirling a virtually
unassailable 22-6 margin and they closed the door with a crashover
scored by Gareth Flockhart, twisting and turning past three tackles
after standing off yet another ruck in a spell of Stirling siege in
which Kevin McKenzie had taken a lead role.
It spoke volumes for College tenacity and resilience, however, and
hinted at what might have been in more favourable conditions that they
signed off with a magnificent bout of handling launched by mazy breakout
from Nick Penny, linkage by Gordon, Ross McNulty and Kittle and swift
exploitation of a tap offside penalty by Niall Gallagher for a closing
try by Graeme Burns and a conversion by Murray Thomson. Teams:
Stewart's-Melville FP -- M M Thomson; N J Penny, P N Gallagher, P W B
Flockhart, D J Bull; F I Pollock, G G Burns; R B McNulty, A J Cadzow, A
J Kittle, B Gordon, W T Faulds, M T Paton, F Calder, D Caughey.
Stirling County -- C M Sangster; A S M Turner, M McGrandles, I C
Jardine, C McRobert; M McKenzie, K G M Harper; J T Gibson, K D McKenzie,
G B Robertson, J S Hamilton, M Norval, G N Flockhart, J Brough, B
Ireland.

Scotland 22, Ireland 3
SCOTLAND, finishing strongly with three tries in the last 25 minutes,
beat Ireland comfortably by 22-3 in the women's rugby international
yesterday at Myreside. It was the third time in as many matches that the
Scots have beaten the Irish.
Ireland had the wind advantage in the first half, but they made little
of it. The interval score was three-all with a penalty goal each by
Elaine Black for Scotland and Raeltine Shrieves.
An intrusion by Debbie Francis from the blind-side wing created the
opening for Sandra Williamson to score in 57 minutes. It was the
Edinburgh scrum half's third try against Ireland.
Scotland profited from their stronger pack when they disrupted an
Irish heel on the visitors' line for flanker Anny Freitas to pounce to
score nine minutes later, and full back Micky Cave rounded off by
running in from fully 40 metres, Black converting.
* GLASGOW have recalled two Stirling County players, Russell Kennedy
and Robert Wyllie, for the team for the under-19 district championship
match against North and Midlands at Cupar on Wednesday (7pm).
Kennedy returns at centre, with Kilmarnock's Stuart Jenkins switching
to the left wing to the exclusion of Ayr's Chris McDonald. Wyllie, who,
like Kennedy, played in the November under-19 district series, replaces
Graeme Inglis, the Hutchesons'/Aloysians wing forward who was sent off
in Glasgow's 12-0 win over the South last week. Team:
R Williams (Stewartry); G D Caldwell (Ayr), R D Kennedy (Stirling), N
Barrett (GHK), S Jenkins (Kilmarnock); A Sievwright (Stirling), R White
(Stewartry); M Smith (Glasgow Academicals), C P Docherty (GHK), R Harvey
(Cartha Queen's Park), D Hough (Ardrossan), G T Macfarlane (West), R
Wyllie (Stirling), E Macdonald (Newton Stewart), I W Sinclair (GHK),
captain. Replacements -- G Ferguson (Ayr), M Hogarth (Ardrossan), D
Wilson (Cambuslang), C McDonald (Ayr), C Houston (Clarkston), S Anderson
(Garnock), L McIntyre (West), D McComiskey (Ayr).

KELSO ensured that they will play in the new second division next
season with a 22-12 victory over Preston Lodge FP at Poynder Park. The
Border club have to thank their best known player, John Jeffrey, for the
only try of the match, with Graeme Aitchison scoring the rest of their
points from a conversion and five penalties.
Biggar, who defeated Haddington 8-0 to move into third place in
Division Two, will have to wait until a final decision is made by the
championship committee as to the validity of the score. The original
referee, John Denham, had to be substituted in the first half after
twisting his knee and was replaced by first class referee Ernie Murray,
who is a Haddington member. Biggar agreed to play the game as a league
match subject to the decision of the championship committee. If the win
stands, Biggar will play at least in the Third Division next season,
still with a chance of pipping Selkirk for the final place in Division
Two.
A place in Division Four of the Premier Division next season is
guaranteed to Ayr after they won their tenth league match in a row 33-13
against Edinburgh University. Their county neighbours, Kilmarnock, are
virtually certain to join them but the other two places in Division Four
are very much in doubt. The next four teams in the league, Clarkston,
Hillhead/Jordanhill, Langholm and Portobello FP, all lost, and these
clubs plus Dunfermline and Trinity Academicals are certain to play in
the First Division of the National League, with two of the clubs winning
the last two places in the Premier Division.
The top two teams in Division Four will also play in the National
First Division but it appears that the final placings will not be known
until the final game of the season, as the top four teams, Glenrothes,
Duns, Livingston and Aberdeen GSFP all won on Saturday.
Berwick, leading Division Five, are certain to play in National League
Division Three next season when they scored their ninth victory in 10
matches, 33-13 against Paisley.
Annan lost their place at the head of Division Six when they were
beaten 19-13 at St Andrews University, their first league defeat in two
seasons. Waysiders/Drumpellier take over the leadership after a 22-12
win over Marr.
Garnock completed their ninth win in as many matches with a 66-5
victory over Panmure in Dundee.
The Ayrshire club will definitely play in National Division Six next
season and look to be on course to winning the Division Seven title next
month. At the bottom of the division, Waid Academy FP, who won their
second league match of the season, and Panmure will play in Division
Seven next season.

GENERAL Cable, Britain's sixth biggest cable operator with 11% of the
market and access to 1.6m homes, is back on the starting grid for
flotation this spring on the London Stock Exchange and on America's
Nasdaq.
The flotation was to have taken place last summer but was postponed
because of poor market conditions and a proponderance of new issues at
the time.
Conditions now are considered to be a lot more favourable for the
issue which should raise more than #200m and value the company at
between #600m asnd #700m.
Philippe Galteau, managing director, commented, ''Current market
conditions and an increased level of awareness and understanding of the
UK cable communciations industry leads us to believe the time is now
appropriate to reinstate our flotation plans and to allow UK investors
the chance to participate further in this exciting industry.''
Aside from providing both telephone and television cable services to
the residential market, General Cable is a major provider of business
telecommunications services within the UK cable communications industry.
It has interests in three of the major UK cable markets, Western London
(The Cable Corporation), Yorkshire (Yorkshire Cable Group) and
Birmingham (Birmingham Cable Corporation).
The company is an indirect subsidiary of Compagnie Ge*ne*rale des Eaux
(CGE), one of the largest public companies in France.
Proceeds of the flotation, which is sponsored by the Lazard Houses
with NatWest Securities as boker to the issue, will be used to fund
General Cable's share of the Systems funding requirements to develop
their networks and to repay borrowings.

WE have an award for the most imaginative reason for a postponed
match. It goes to Partick Thistle, ever an inventive side.
The Diary dutifully turned up at Firhill on Saturday, on your behalf,
to sample the executive lunch and watch Thistle play Motherwell. A
mournful Tommy Dickson, the Jags' commercial manager, was busy putting
the champagne back on ice, the pea and ham soup on the back burner, and
the pies into the fridge.
''The groundsman thinks it's something to do with the greenhouse
effect,'' said Tommy, referring to the sea of mud that is presently
masquerading as the Firhill pitch. This is as clever as anything British
Rail ever comes up with, we thought, and could be the start of a whole
new genre of excuses for the benefit of disappointed fans.
Such as: leaves on the pitch, wrong kind of snow in the penalty area,
a signalling failure involving the stand-side linesman, Chic Charnley
running out of steam.
Between the global warming and their undersoil heating, Thistle should
have the hottest quagmire of any pitch. Mud bath, anyone?
The postponement denied the Diary the opportunity for this vigorous
sporting work-out: 12noon champagne reception; 12.15 address by Robert
Reid, Thistle historian; 12.30 more champagne; 12.45 John Lambie's
observations on the the forthcoming clash; 1.15 four-course lunch with
wines, liqueurs and cigars; 2.30 pre-match entertainment with stand-up
comic; 3pm the match, with pies and hot drinks at half-time; 4.40-5.30
back to the bar.
The Diary was particularly disappointed to miss the tour of the
Thistle trophy room (12.17 to 12.18). And John Lambie's analysis. Mr
Lambie recently informed a radio audience concerning a Thistle
performance: ''We were cock-a-hop (sic) but then it was a case of one
flew over the cuckoo's nest.'' Mr Lambie is a keen pigeon-fancier.
Lure of the lycra
IT was a short hop, step and jump from Firhill to the Kelvin Sports
Arena for the Great Britain v. France indoor athletics. For some, it was
the lure of the lycra. ''My husband's here to see Zodiac and I'll
definitely be having a peek at Linford Christie,'' a West End lady
informed us.
Zodiac is the glamorous TV gladiator who, in a parallel life, is Kate
Staples, the British pole vaulter. The Diary was afraid that, at any
moment, fellow gladiators Jet and Panther might descend on bungee ropes
from the Kelvin Hall roof to spoil Zodiac's run-up.
Kate Staples proved herself not only a lycra lovely but a proficient
athlete, winning her competition easily.
The whole event had a kindergarten quality with hordes of weans
clattering around trying to get Zodiac's autograph. There were also free
samples of Lucozade sports drink. One lady had two tins stuffed into the
ample waistband of her skirt. Well, why not? Linford Christie apparently
keeps his cans of Lucozade down the front of his shorts.
Off-balance
IN the business pages of the Daily Telegraph the day before the last
lot of Five Nations matches, we find an interview with international
rugby referee Tony Trigg. He is in the financial pages because his day
job is finance director of Allied Domecq, the bevvy multinational.
But he is talking about rugby and his experiences having refereed 16
internationals. ''It makes you very broad-minded and balanced,'' he
says. He adds: ''Sadly I will be at Murrayfield on Saturday when anybody
at all interested in rugby football will be at Twickenham.'' See these
balanced, broad-minded English, don't you just love them?
Sting in the tail
WHAT'S this we hear of fists flying during a pre-Murrayfield friendly
match between a Cartha Queen's Park verterans' XV and some of their
soul-mates from the Emerald Isle?
Afraid so, with one of the Cartha chaps being sent off for a bit of
boxing. Who could be so churlish as to welcome our Irish cousins in this
way?
An Irishman, in fact. Niall Loakman, a well-known Glasgow banker,
found himself making the early trip to the showers. But don't be too
harsh on our man. He has already been punished. As a result of a small
wound received in the encounter he had to have a tetanus jag.

'To The Woman Alone, going to the bookies is like gatecrashing a
Masonic meeting'
OVER the years there have been many changes in the socially accepted
Things To Do. Naturally, a woman must still wear a knee-length skirt to
Henley; hats, of course, are still de rigeur at Ascot. But children are
allowed into pubs and football fans are even buying shares. However,
there remains a tight knit community where women are still viewed with
utmost suspicion.
Enter The Woman Who Goes To The Bookies Alone or as the punters view
her, The Woman With Two Heads.
I like football and racing and am not averse to a wager on the outcome
of the 3.15 at Wincanton or the result of a third division tie between
Caley Thistle and Ross County, but the problem starts with crossing the
threshold of the bookies.
All credit to the major chains. They have made every effort to make
their offices more user-friendly, but it's hard to get away from the
smoke-filled, down-at-heel atmosphere, especially as the changes have
mainly entailed soft drinks machines, nasty plastic seating, and patches
of carpet. Recently I visited a betting shop in Glasgow city centre, but
at the mention of a ladies' toilet there were only blank stares. That's
hardly the way to encourage a mixed clientele.
The first hurdle for The Woman Alone is actually going into the shop.
First, the furtive glance up and down the street to see if anyone
recognises you; second, the dash through the door before anyone does;
third, the embarrassing silence.
Once inside, for the uninitiated it's like the command centre at Nasa.
The screens blink and flicker, and mysterious phrases blare over the
tannoy. On the way to the post, under orders, and the magic words
''they're off''. Pictures flash in from all over the world: one minute
South Africa, then the quaint cosiness of National Hunt racing from
Kelso, the 'crack' from Fairyhouse and finally the delights of greyhound
racing at Catford. A daunting experience, and that's before placing a
bet.
To a stranger it would be a minefield; to The Woman Alone it's like
gatecrashing a Masonic meeting. And the phrases are just as alien. What
kind of bet to put on? A placepot, a jackpot, a Yankee, a Canadian, or
the strangely named Heinz. Where did these names come from and why isn't
there a Burmese, a Gambian, or even a Venezuelan?
Having steered a course through these complexities the moment of truth
arrives. You've glanced through the form, made your selection, handed in
the slip and now all eyes are on the screen. Just as well, because The
Woman Alone still has to contend with the suspicious stares of regulars
bemused by her presence.
Racing is often described as the sport of kings, and the Queen's
interest has long been documented, but the men who frequent the bookies
are a long way from the royal enclosure at Ascot. The betting shop is a
sociologist's dream . . . or nightmare.
The Man Who Knows It All has swaggered across and derides the choices
of the other punters. His Saturday has begun by watching Channel 4's
Morning Line. He is sure of success. This will be the day when it will
all come right for him. He begins to shout strange phrases at the
screen. ''Ease up'' he boasts as his horse romps home or ''How far'' as
it gallops 10 lengths ahead of its rivals coming round the home bend.
That's on a good day. On a bad one there will be a questions over the
jockey's pre-race activities.
There are several other stereotypes in betting shops from Inverness to
Stranraer. There's always The Drunk. (Often more than one). There's also
the Old Man With Nowhere Else To Go; and The Medallion Man. The most
fascinating members of the cast is The Man Who Has Bet His Shirt. He's
the hardest to spot. For nonchalance is the key here.
After his selection goes on its nose going over the last while 20
lengths clear, the only indication that he might be suffering is a
slight tightening of his frame and possibly a blink of his eye. This man
has ice in his veins. For him it's not always the winning that matters,
but merely the taking part. Meanwhile, The Man Who Knows It All is
throwing his #1 slip on the floor in disgust.
But for all the suspicion and dread of being The Woman Alone there is
something entrancing about the atmosphere and the sense of excitement
when your selection wins at 8-1, especially when you're the only one
collecting that magic word . . . winnings.
One final mystery: We often hear of the luck of the Irish. Surely they
must believe that themselves because I've never been in a betting shop
where there wasn't an Irish accent. And not all of them were priests.

ANDY Goram: Villain or victim? Depending on which newspapers you take
and your indentikit picture of a sporting hero you will make a choice,
but if Goram is anything he is an enigma.
He gives the impression he has decided to prove all on his own the
sporting adage that goalkeepers are cerebrally challenged, yet his
behaviour between the sticks suggests something entirely different. In
fact, he survives in his sport by virtue of a mentality more robust than
the persona may suggest.
How else could the Rangers keeper get out of bed in the morning? A
variety of problems are pressing down on Goram, but somehow he picks
himself up. With emotions bruised it isn't easy to switch on a smile,
but he forces himself to project a carefree image.
''How you look can be half the battle,'' he said. ''It's important to
appear confident and brash, perhaps because there is such a fine line
between success and failure for a keeper.''
Natural or not, there is an easy manner about Goram and in common with
the famous he has a certain magnetism, but unfortunately for him he
attracts problems and can find himself in compromising situations which,
of course, appeal greatly to the tabloid press. Despite the Jack the Lad
front, life can be difficult, although Goram refuses to retreat from the
world.
Whereas others woud be afraid to open the curtains again, Goram can
walk out in front of 45,000 and perform like a real-life Alf Tupper.
''Perhaps it's a strength I have. I don't know, but I do know I love to
play football,'' he says, ''and sometimes when I walk out in front of
all those supporters it is like escaping.''
Like himself his statement is a contradiction. Goram, now 32, can
build barriers inside his head, shutting off all matters which have no
bearing on his game, and while football has long been a passion it now
offers refuge from his foibles and those who live off them.
He insists he is sometimes followed by strangers, and far from
succumbing to paranoia he believes his shadows have been dispatched by
the small-page papers hungry for further peccadilloes and exposes like
the one which ran in a blatt a couple of weeks ago.
''You know, if everything written or said about me were true I'd be
bankrupt,'' he said. ''I'd have no home. I'd have nothing.
''All right, I've done things I shouldn't have and in future I'll be
more careful, but it is ridiculous when you have to look over your
shoulder whenever you go out and be forced to make detours because
someone is following you.
''I enjoy a pint with my friends in Penicuik, but why shouldn't I? And
yes, I also like the horses, but why should that make me any different
from most others?''
Probably because he is the goalkeeper for Rangers and Scotland, and
whether he likes it or not his job sets him apart in that it gives him
recognition, fame, and a certain status. In the Scottish village that
makes him a target, and in his more reflective moments he admits he
sometimes makes himself easy prey.
''Footballers are noticed and sometimes we do give them (the tabloids)
ammunition,'' he admitted.
Goram was not the first footballer to feature in a kiss-and-tell
story, but fortunately his marriage to Tracy remains intact. He is
learning from mistakes, which will come as a relief to those closest to
him and also Rangers' manager Walter Smith, who must be afraid to lift
the papers in the morning.
His players are big news off the field also, but Goram at least has
resolved to remain on the back pages, although he is not about to
undergo radical character change. ''I can't. If I were to change I
wouldn't be Andy Goram and who knows, that could have an effect on the
way I play,'' he said.
''I have had a long talk with Walter Smith and I know Rangers can't
tolerate being involved in certain stories, but I can't stop being me. I
am what I am.
''I know everybody has me marked down now as some kind of idiot, but
there's not much I can do about that, and I don't believe I should have
to explain myself to anyone other than my wife and the gaffer.
''Tracy is interested in football and I can go home and talk to her
which means I don't bottle everything up. That helps because I'm deeper
than people think, but only my family see the emotion.
''So far as the gaffer is concerned I don't think he wants me to
change, although I have to be more careful in the future. But I'm no
monk.''
No doubt the religious community are much relieved. They have problems
of their own and are answerable to a much higher authority than even
Walter Smith, who does his best to try to fathom Goram, to understand
what makes his keeper tick. It can't be easy.
First mention of the keeper's name can induce a roll of the eyes and a
shake of the head, but after exasperation comes appreciation for Goram's
ability. ''He is the best keeper I have ever worked with,'' says Smith,
who admits Goram's exploits are of concern to a club which must be
conscious of the corporate image.
''So far though, this stuff about his outside life doesn't seem to
hurt what he does for us,'' Smith added, ''and if he takes care of
himself he could go on doing it for a while yet.''
But how much longer does Goram have? He must adhere to a specially
designed training regime to protect a his left knee which was rebuilt
two years ago and most of his fitness work is done in the gymnasium. A
balance has to be maintained between fitness and protection, yet the
32-year-old has a tendency to put on weight, something else about which
he must always be mindful.
If he remains in control, Goram, who is still recovering from a
hamstring which he damaged five weeks ago, reckons he can play at the
sharp end for another five season and earlier this season Rangers
extended his contract until 1998. But that was after Smith, critical of
the keeper's attitude toward work, had put him on the transfer list.
In response, Goram buckled down and he is at Ibrox until four in the
afternoon working in the gym. ''I want to get out in front of the
supporters, the people who are usually the first to let a player know
when he isn't doing it for them,'' he said.
Goram has become one of the crowd's favourites and he thrives on their
respect and appreciation. He is inspired by the sound, the passion, and
the tension of match days and in difficult times it is the thought of
sampling the atmosphere again which helps him through, but what will
inspire him when the chants subside and the ball stops rolling?
Often players heavily dependent on the weekly fix fail to cope when it
is withdrawn and life can become unbearable. The former player becomes
difficult and depression is never far away, but Goram knows what he will
be doing.
''When it's over, I'll play cricket,'' he said. ''You know, I've
always preferred playing cricket to football probably because of the
one-on-one thing. Bowler against batsman and vice versa. Cricket will
become Andy Goram's refuge.''
Goram signed for West Bromwich Abion the same year he signed for
Lancashire, but after a short spell at the Hawthorns he moved to Oldham
and made his debut in goal when he was 17. It was around that time his
father, Lewis, who died two years ago, was advising him to concentrate
on football because the financial rewards would be greater.
As a 20-year-old with a gift he came into contact with goalkeeping
coach Alan Hodgkinson, who still works with him two days a week at
Ibrox, and the pair developed a relationship based on mutual respect and
trust. In fact, Goram says Hodgkinson, who works with various keepers
and also the Scottish international side, became principal confidant in
succession to his father and he turns frequently to the Englishman.
However, when the game starts Goram is on his own. It's the way he
likes it and if he can keep only a few important people in his life
happy that will do.

Sir,--For the first time in many years, I sat at home to watch
Scotland's latest rugby exploits. Whilst enjoying the comfort of my own
home, and the freedom to partake of the national distillation at will, I
missed greatly being at Murrayfield. It is becoming increasingly
difficult, if not well nigh impossible, for an ordinary supporter to
attend a major international. Tickets are available to rugby club
members, as they should be; to those wealthy enough to have a debenture
or two; or to those who have joined the hospitality tents. It would
appear that rugby, or in particular Murrayfield, has no desire to
welcome the unattached to their portals. This is a great shame as I am
sure many who attend under the auspices of hospitality do so for the
champagne and smoked salmon, and not for the rugby.
The last time I managed to gain entry to Murrayfield, I was struck by
the austerity of the arena. Gone was the warmth and vitality that was
such an important ingredient in Scotland's triumphant 1990 season. Then
the crowd almost seemed to participate in the game, now they seem to be
mere onlookers peering down from a great height upon a distant scene.
The passion of the Scottish crowd has been neutered, which must be a
great pity to those striving in the Nation's colours.
The drive of the SRU in constructing such a magnificent arena must be
applauded. My concern is that it may engender even more elitism amongst
the support than was already in existence, and is curtailing the growing
appeal of the game as a spectator sport.

Sir,--Whether or not Willie Miller's dismissal will benefit Aberdeen
in the long run is a matter of opinion.
What I found objectionable was Miller's reaction, complaining that he
had been let down, stabbed in the back, or words to that effect. That
may be true, but I don't remember him complaining about the dismissal of
Alex Smith, as a result of a campaign by some supporters to get Miller
the job in the first place. Alex Smith took his sacking quietly and with
dignity, although he had much more cause for complaint (winner of both
League and Scottish cups, regularly championship runners-up).
Mind you, Willie Miller never could accept a decision given against
him.

Sir,--As an Albion Rovers season ticket-holder for many, many years I
am thoroughly disgusted and angry at the attitude of ARFC board of
directors (Marwick, McGoogan, Forrester, Lyttle) over the sacking of
team manager Tom Spence.
Tom Spence was making something of that team. Even the supporters knew
this. That's why there was no barracking directed at Tom Spence from the
supporters, and with no money coming from the board either to buy
players or sign on players, I think Tom was performing a miracle every
week just fielding a side. Players like Billy Dolan, Jim Kerr, and
others played for the Rovers not for the money (God help them) but for T
Spence.
Had Tom Spence been given the money that was wasted on the terracing
(which still can't be used) he could have taken us into the first
division by now.
It's embarrassing for true supporters to see the chairman and
directors toast the team losing a game and on TV, too. I think it's time
the SFA stepped in to stop the boards of football clubs drinking alcohol
before, during (at half-time) and after games. It's called hospitality
by the way.
Hospitality should mean putting a good team on the park for the
supporters and encouraging your manager and team to do well.
By the way, Mr Marwick, why the rush to sell the ground?
I think you and your board are trying to do a Third Lanark to this
club!
Shame on you all.

Sir,--Perhaps when the governing bodies of Scottish Sport start to
reap the benefits of the National Lottery they will consider allocating
a substantial share to the ''outposts'' of Scotland, to compensate for
the disadvantages they suffer.
As an adopted Aberdonian who left sunny Govan some 20 years ago for
the Silver City, I am acutely aware of the problems facing sports
enthusiasts who live in the north.
Progress is being made, but in so many disciplines the cream are
achieving success in spite of the facilities, not because of them. Where
in the north or north-east can budding hurdlers or hockey stars hone
their skills on a cold winter night?
For competition they have to overcome the attitude that the major
fixtures must be held in central Scotland, not only because they have
the best facilities, but because the north and north-east are too far
for competitors to travel.
The journey north is the same length as the journey south which so
many dedicated sportsmen and woman make routinely before every major
competition. Let us hope that the governing bodies, based in central
Scotland, will take this opportunity to redress the balance.

Sir, -- Back in 1973, Celtic took their eighth title in succession. In
the last seven games they scored 23 goals for the loss of only one. It
was a beautifully honed professional game, full of attacking verve.
Twenty-two years on, we watch Rangers grind towards a seventh
consecutive league flag. The #70m plus has bought a consistent ability
to hammer Scottish oponents into submission, but little else. None of
the seven titles could ever be called memorable; Laudrup and
Mikhailichenko the only interesting players. The club's real enterprise
is shown in financial management, standing as a perfect example of
Thatcherism, housed in a stadium which is a monument to Calvinism.
Where is the entertainment in that?

SOMEONE should take Fergus McCann aside and explain to him the facts
of football life, before he carries Celtic into a damaging conflict with
the Scottish Football Association.
No-one is doubting the Canadian millionaire's ability to read a
balance sheet, and after the so-successful share issue his business
acumen cannot be seriously questioned, particularly by the people who
took the grand old club to the brink of bankruptcy.
But in football affairs the Celtic saviour has a great deal to learn.
So far there have been few signs that he is willing to live by the
rules and regulations of either the SFA or the Scottish Football League.
Instead of the #100,000 fine imposed by the League providing a
salutary lesson for McCann, he has now gone on to challenge the
authority of the SFA in the Tommy Burns poaching saga.
Once more he has placed the club on a collision course with the game's
ruling body, and once again he will lose.
But, more important than McCann, Celtic will be losers, too. That is
perhaps the saddest thing of all. A club, no, more than a club, an
institution, is now losing friends.
One leading legislator told me recently: ''It used to be a pleasure to
visit the Celtic boardroom. Nowadays no-one in the game feels
particularly comfortable when they go there . . . ''
Now, in the grand scheme of things, that may not be too important; but
in football people have to learn to live together in what is a small
community. Quite clearly the man in command at Parkhead is finding that
difficult.
Eventually that will be a major problem for the club. Over the years
Celtic have enjoyed a good relationship with both footballing bodies --
better than that enjoyed by their Old Firm rivals.
That is something which McCann should be guarding jealously, instead
of frittering it away in futile arguments with authority which he is
never going to win.
Basically, Celtic cannot be run like any of the other business
ventures that made McCann his millions. That is because Celtic -- and
any football club you care to mention -- is more than merely a business.
Figures on a balance sheet cannot convey the depth of feeling clubs
can instil in their supporters. Nor can dividends for shareholders be
expected on any kind of regular basis.
Football just isn't like that. It is far, far different, as many other
millionaires found out before the Celtic chief executive came on the
scene.
In the not-so-distant past, clubs were run by businessmen who used
football to boost their images in the local communities. Now a different
breed of entrepreneur has come in but, essentially, the game has not
altered.
The rules haven't changed either. Whatever the current belief at
Parkhead, these rules are the same for every club.
When Sir Robert Kelly and, later, Desmond White, and still later, Jack
McGinn, were chairmen of the club, that was recognised. They would argue
the club's cause, defend the club's position, but they would never break
the rules in the flagrant manner of the Burns case and then expect to
get away with it.
Fergus McCann should take their example on board. There is no way that
anyone -- no matter how wealthy he may be -- ever will be allowed to run
roughshod over the soccer establishment.
Rangers chairman David Murray learned that lesson when he was left
with a bloody nose after ill-advised attempts to start a Super League.
McCann, despite warnings, has still to realise he is out of his depth
when it comes to tackling the often-complex legislation of our national
game.
It is now time for him to realise that he is on a loser over the Burns
affair. His fellow clubs -- with one exception -- have already told him
that. Now he should accept the overwhelming verdict.
When he is persuaded to do so then, perhaps, instead of all these
various diversions, the chief executive can address the REAL issues at
Parkhead, the issues that most concern his newly enfranchised support.
Because although the rescue package has been successful, there remains
a deep well of discontent among fans about what is happening on the
field.
That is where attention must be focused. Rows with the SFA, rows with
former employees, rows with other clubs, and even rows with discredited
former board members, cannot disguise the fact that only part of the
salvage operation has been accomplished.
The one that matters most, the premier division balance sheet if you
like, makes bleak reading. Celtic have won only around a quarter of
their games and scored just a goal a game in doing so.
That suggests to me that ALL energies at the club should be
concentrated on just the one thing -- and I don't mean the seemingly
endless and futile arguments which simply disguise the Parkhead
problems.
Celtic MUST qualify for Europe. If they don't, then the rescue
scenario will have a tarnished look and the new shareholders will demand
answers.
When the recent history of the club is written, Fergus McCann will
hold an honoured place as the man who stopped Celtic going into
receivership. But, if he wants more than that, then money has to be
released to bring in new players, and that has to happen sooner rather
than later.
For if the transfer moves are delayed much longer, Europe could become
a distant memory and no amount of diversions would save Fergus McCann
from the criticism that would follow.

GAELIC football is from Ireland, of course. It stands a bit between
soccer and rugby, but if the Rugby School hadn't corrupted the game
through that Ellis chap, Association and Rugby might not have diverged.
For the very origins of football lie in a very rough game, played by
very rough rubes.
For Gaelic football was played in Britain, and Scotland for many years
continued to hold the game in many a town. Ireland, of course, had
bigger problems than Scotland, and the games of hurling -- shinty in
Scotland -- and the native Gaelic football games and many other sports,
Irish and Highland dancing, and many another Celtic activity,
damned-near died out.
It was not until very late in the nineteenth century that the Gaelic
Athletic Association (GAA) came into being in order to preserve and, in
a way, re-invent the marvellous traditions of Gaelic culture. To that
end has become the remarkable development of Irish dancing, mainly for
the girls in truth, and in very recent years indeed, Gaelic football.
Thus the Willie Dowds Cup, held this weekend at St Aloysius' Rugby Park
in Millerston, near Glasgow.
The weekend saw a huge upsurge of Glasgow Irish consciousness for this
splendid attraction of Donegal versus Dublin. Three years ago the
culchies of Donegal had beaten the jackeens of Dublin in the Irish Sam
McGuire Final, a famous victory, celebrated throughout all the counties
of that country. This year, the third year running, the Glasgow-based
Pearse Park Development Fund people had the top Irish teams competing.
But much more.
There was a ceilidh on Saturday night, of course, with a large
contingent of Irish visitors, many meeting their relations in Glasgow,
relations who have lived here many years. There was a banquet and dinner
last night in a top Glasgow hotel. There is a civic reception for all
concerned at the Glasgow City Chambers this morning. But there was also
the football.
Sunday saw the girls teams competing, Scotland represented by the
Dundee Dalriada team. Most of the girls are actually Irish lassies
studying at Dundee University, average age 20, fine players but with no
experience at all, and they could not hope to beat a very experienced
team from Donegal Downings, who are a great deal younger. The Donegal
team captain was young Susie McGee a 16-year-old schoolgirl, and she is
one of the older girls. But, as the Downings-Donegal manager, Hugh
McClafferty, pointed out in a sporting manner, the Donegal team can draw
upon 21 different Donegal girls' clubs -- Scotland has only one, with
the bulk of the lassies taken from a small Scottish Yooni.
But the young Donegal girls won handsomely with eight goals and eight
points against the rather feeble three points scored by the Caledonian
team. A score of 32-3 was a bit humiliating, or would have been if it
wasn't for the fact that neither Gaels nor girls will slash their wrists
at a footy result. They enjoyed their game and so did myself.
The lassies were followed by the wee boys on a truly dreadful pitch,
(though not as dreadful as it should have been for an old chum, Dougie
Donaldson, the St Aloysius' groundsman who has over 30 years' experience
in his game, hirpled about the last two days, him with a slipped disc,
too, spiking the playing surface. His assistant, Derek Gibson, a mere
boy with 15 years looking after grounds, told me the surface water on
Saturday was so bad they doubted the matches could take place. ''But we
are the best in the business,'' the lads spake in chorus, and indeed
they are: the ground conditions were more than adequate).
The wee boys, captained by 12-year-old Kevin Lafferty, a pupil at
Cambuslang's Trinity High, won for Scotland by a massive advantage of
three goals and two points against only eight points for a Warwickshire
team, representing England. Scotland can win at something, for heaven's
sake. Young Kevin has only been playinga year but I would not pit myself
against him. He's a big wee lad.
But yet another big wee lad is Packy Bonner, the Celtic and Ireland
legend, who once indeed played for Donegal himself. Said Packy: ''You
learn handling from Gaelic, of course, and you learn fitness and how to
handle yourself physically. Gaelic isn't a game for the wee geniuses
like Jimmy Johnstone. You need a bit of weight.'' Dear God, the man is
right. Have you ever seen the height of Packy? Dean Swift, his fellow
countryman, got the idea of Gulliver from Packy.
But this was the big game, the girls and youngsters were but the
starters. The Willie Dowds Cup is no friendly: it is fiercely
competitive. And so it proved to be in this match betwixt the country
and city slickers. Donegal won at the end, but damned close it was. A
John Duffy goal for Donegal won the match really, for they scored only
10 points as against the Dubs' 11 points, with man of the match,
Dublin's John Gildea, scoring four points on his own.
Close to his own achievements has to be the remarkable performances of
the two goalkeepers, even if Dublin's Tom Quinn did fluff a put-in from
Donegal's Duffy. Quinn had an exemplary match after that. But Gary
Walsh, whom we met last year, an accountant from Donegal, had two
wonderful saves in the very last minute, one from Dublin's mercurial
full forward Charlie Redmond (the Maurice Johnson of Gaelic football),
and a rebound to Dessie Farrell saw a save which came from the moon. It
was the last move in the match. Had Dublin scored then they would have
won.
The new Donegal manager P J McGowan, who but recently took over from
Brian McEniff of Bundoran, summed it up twice. ''We won and were lucky
but good enough.'' That was the first summing. The other one was
succinct: ''Will you have a wee one?'' I would. I did. And glad.
' 'You learn handling from Gaelic, of course, and you learn fitness
and how to handle yourself physically.  You need a bit of weight. ' -

FOOTBALL might be rather predictable otherwise, so perhaps it is just
as well that footballers are human. But it makes life difficult for the
managers, as most of the performances in the second division on Saturday
demonstrated.
Clyde manager Alex Smith saw his side lose 3-1 at home to Berwick
Rangers and it was only at 0-3, just after the interval, that Clyde
began to look like a competent team.
''I don't understand it,'' Smith admitted. ''We played so well in
midweek against Dundee United, and also a fortnight ago against them,
and we had a good result in between at Methil. And these are the same
players.''
His only theory was that Clyde's efforts against a premier division
team perhaps took more of a toll on them than the exertions of other
teams against their peers.
Berwick had had two games in two days against Meadowbank which ended
with the disappointment of missing out on a cup-tie against Celtic.
''But it is up to me to lift them,'' manager Tom Hendrie had said before
Saturday's game.
He certainly succeeded. They posed all the threats early on and scored
following free kicks after 25 and 39 minutes. Willie Irvine crossed for
their trialist defender to nod in the opener and a clearance was picked
up by Martin Neil, who drilled in the second from 20 yards.
Warren Hawke headed in an Alan Banks cross for the third and when
substitute Alan McKenzie's header cut the leeway in 56 minutes it served
only to put the home crowd in a more tolerant mood.
Morton, supposedly goal-shy, won 3-0 away to a Stirling Albion team
who had inflicted a first home defeat on leaders Stenhousemuir just a
week before. Derek McInnes set up Derek Lilley's run on goal just before
the break, and scored the second himself from a pass by Marko Rajamaki,
who also set up a tap-in for Alan Mahood.
Meadowbank were only a shadow of the team who had edged past Berwick
and were crushed 4-0 at Dumbarton. Martin Mooney scored the first and
set up the second for Hugh Ward, who turned provider for Charlie Gibson
and Martin McGarvey.

Ayr United 1, Dundee 0
EVERYONE who has listened to the man is well aware that Jim Duffy
talks a good game, has his finger on the pulse of what's happening, is
-- in the footballing sense -- streetwise.
But words uttered by the Dundee manager after his side's 1-0 defeat
against Ayr United at Somerset Park at the weekend were, it would
appear, not for those of a reserved or delicate disposition.
Duffy was with his men for ages in the away dressing room after the
ball had stopped bouncing on Saturday, and although most of the dialogue
was somewhat incoherent from the hallway outside the changing facility,
one could gather by his tone that Duffy was none too pleased.
It is a wonder smoke did not bellow from under the door, such appeared
to be the roasting that was in progress, but when Duffy eventually
appeared he was his usual courteous, calm self -- but his face told
another story.
''You must be disappointed, Jim,'' came a statement. By the man's
expression it was like suggesting to him that Atilla the Hun's main
problem was that the guy just suffered from behavioural problems. ''That
is the understatement of the year,'' said Duffy.
But now comes the difference, because most other managers would have
kicked butt, moaned a little, sworn even, and then forgiven and
forgotten. But not our Jim.
He was obviously brought up in a different way, believing that money
paid out in wages should be worked for, and as his employees had not
done a hand's turn throughout the afternoon, he said that he would fine
them.
A sudden hush went around the place.
He was joking, wasn't he? Hacks looked at each other in disbelief
waiting for the man to smile and say: ''Only kidding, lads,'' but he
didn't.
We have all seen matches where players should have paid the customers
to watch, but to actually dock wages, that really is most unusual.
He will never get away with it, some thought. Will he? Quite frankly,
Duffy could not have cared less what his players' reaction would be, if
they did not do the business -- and they sure did not -- he would fine
them one third of their wages.
And I, for one, am right behind him.
''They can go to the union, do whatever they like,'' he said. ''The
players get appearance money as part of their wages and today they
didn't appear.
''It's a team game, and as a team unit today we were a disgrace.
People pay good money to travel to see us. We can't give the fans their
money back so we will remove it from the players.''
One was of the impression that Duffy could have gone up like a volcano
at any time, such was his displeasure, but he was keeping a tight rein
on his emotions at least to the outside world.
And the manager was not for turning.
''The money will not go into a club fund for any social evenings,'' he
said. ''We will donate it to charity or something like that. It will not
be going to the players.''
Had this performance been dished up in the formative part of the
season, it would not have been tolerated by the Dundee management, but
the damage may have eventually been limited at a later time. But now,
going into the final circuit, that is what appeared so irksome to the
manager.
This defeat means that Dundee, once looking down at the rest of the
first division from afar, have now been caught, and although still in
front, are there by the skin of the teeth, and perhaps now the momentum
has been grasped by others.
As the Dundee players filed past with petted lips, Simon Stainrod was
holding court with the media. The Ayr manager was once the darling of
Dens Park as player/manager, but recently he has become a perfect pest
to the club.
His United side have taken seven of a possible nine points from Dundee
this season and when it is taken on board that Saturday's success was
only Ayr's fourth in the league all season, it is little wonder Stainrod
looked relieved.
However, let us not allow ourselves to be carried off in the euphoria,
because Ayr are no more than a very ordinary team -- a better side would
really have punished Dundee for their ineptness -- but at least this
victory allows the Somerset Park lot to scramble clear of the immediate
drop zone, for the time being.
The winning goal was scored while some were still getting themselves
comfortable. Stainrod -- of course he had to be involved, didn't he --
took a corner, the ball looked over and Vinnie Moore met it with his
forehead, allowing the home fans to work up a lather with excitement.
Stainrod said that the victory should work wonders for his side's
morale, and that after having played well in recent weeks with little to
show for their efforts, United were due a rub of the green.
Dundee now face Raith Rovers, whose warm breath they now feel on the
back of their neck in the table, in a Scottish Cup tie on Saturday, and
if Dundee do not get their act together I, for one, would not fancy
being within 100 miles of their manager that afternoon.

STEFAN Effenberg, sent home in disgrace from the World Cup Finals for
making an obscene gesture to German supporters, has had his return to
the national side blocked by captain Lothar Matthaus.
German coach Berti Vogts had revealed he was considering having the
life ban lifted on Effenberg, who has been highly effective in the
emergence of Borrusia Monchengladbach in the championship of the
Bundesliga this season.
But Matthaus, in a display of player-power that further undermined the
position of Vogts, insisted he would not tolerate a recall for Effenberg
and that Germany had enough quality to continue without his services.
A day later Vogts was forced to admit: ''The time is not right for
Effenberg to play for his country again; the wounds have not healed
after his actions in America.''
By contrast, the career of Tony Meola, who became a national hero
after captaining the USA in the World Cup Finals, continues upwards and
onwards.
The keeper will fulfil his wish to become an actor when he opens in an
off-Broadway production next week. The play, aptly called Tony and
Tina's Wedding, will run for five weeks.
Then he is off to play in Brazil with Botofoga, who are currently
negotiating to sign Bebeto from Deportivo la Coruna.
Since last summer's event, Meola has been playing baseball with the
New York Jets and indoor football with Buffalo Blizzards, whose
attendances almost doubled when he joined the club.
* THE Spanish FA has launched an investigation after claims that
Atletico Madrid rigged games to avoid relegation last season.
The allegations come from former assistant coach Diego Berregan, who
was sacked along with Francisco Maturana because of poor results.
He said that Manuel Diaz Vega, Spain's top referee, had twice been
bribed to obtain favourable results for the Madrid club. One of the
games, he said, was against Osasuna.
The Spanish FA has asked their counterparts in Colombia, where
Berregan is now employed, to provide proof to substantiate the
corruption charges.
However, Atletico Madrid's president, Jesus Gil, has ridiculed the
claims, maintaining they were made to cause trouble in the wake of
Berregan's dismissal.
* FIFA has been called in to settle the future of the Portuguese
internationalist Luis Figo, who apparently has agreed contracts with
both Juventus and Parma.
His duplicity has brought protests among the supporters of Sporting
Lisbon where he has been attacked, his car trashed, and demonstrations
have caused training sessions to be abandoned.
* CONTROVERSY has again clouded Romario's attempt to re-launch his
career atFlamengo.
Apart from several well-publicised fracas in nightclubs, including an
assault on a woman fan who attempted to obtain his autograph, he is
being sued for divorce.
This follows a paternity suit filed against him by a Spanish woman.
Romario, who was also involved in a car crash, said with masterly
understatement:
''This is not a good period in my career, but it is the price of fame.
Supporters want to build you up then knock you down. I am not a god. I
am only a human being.''
His countryman, Augusto Candido, just 23, of Belgian Second Division
side FC Boom, is the third player to die of a heart attack there this
season.
A call has now gone out to improve medical facilities, particularly
rescuscitation equipment, for players at stadia.
Plea by Gullit
A STATESMAN-like call has come from Ruud Gullit to his fellow
professionals in Italy to shun all contact with the Ultras, the
fanatical elements that follow most of the leading clubs and who were
responsible for the tragic death of Genoa fan The former Dutch
international insisted: ''These so-called supporters do not love the
game. They cause more trouble than we can cope with.
''We have also seen riots in London at Chelsea and the death of
another fan in Paris.
''It is now the duty of the players to take a stance and say enough is
enough.
''The players must shun these people and make it clear that we despise
their actions.
''Maybe if we lead a revolution against the Ultras it will end the
traumas and make it a place for decent people to go without fear,''
Gullit said.

IN ENGLAND
0HAD Blackburn won at Old Trafford three weeks ago, they would have
been eight points clear at the top of the Premiership and heavily
fancied to land a first championship since the Great War. Instead, Eric
Cantona scored for Manchester United to cut the lead to two and on
Saturday it was overhauled, however briefly, for the first time in 11
weeks.
But yesterday Alan Shearer grabbed goal No.28 of the campaign with a
second-half header as Blackburn beat 10-man Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 to
leapfrog back to the top.
Near half-time Wednesday's Kevin Pressman was sent off for
deliberately handling Paul Warhurst's shot outside his area. Former
Rangers and England keeper Chris Woods came on in his place.
By then Blackburn were set to go two points clear after a super strike
by Tim Sherwood and a close-range finish from Mark Atkins had sandwiched
Chris Waddle's goal for the visitors.
The evidence of United's comprehensive 3-0 victory over Manchester
City on Saturday was that the Reds will manage without Cantona -- at
least against sides offering no more testing a challenge than their
neighbours have given them this season.
Andy Cole suggested, in making a goal for Paul Ince and scoring the
third himself, that he is settling in nicely; Andrei Kanchelskis, the
other scorer, implied that he will have a greater part to play than in
recent weeks; and all this in the absence of Mark Hughes, tipped to make
an unexpectedly early return following his recent knee injury.
One record United lost on Saturday was for the biggest Premiership
victory of the season, their earlier romp against City being superseded
by Aston Villa's extraordinary 7-1 win over Wimbledon -- who scored
first. Tommy Johnson, recently signed from Derby County, claimed a hat
trick in the reprisals that followed as Peter Shilton, who has joined
the London club as reserve goalkeeper, wondered what he had let himself
in for.
Villa have now lost only twice in 13 league games -- both narrowly and
unluckily -- since Brian Little replaced Ron Atkinson as their manager.
Mark McGhee, who succeeded him at Leicester, has not managed such a
transformation, and on Saturday laid into his team after what some might
have regarded as a good draw, 1-1 away to Arsenal.
McGhee said: ''Not enough of the players seem to care about results or
the club's position, or even each other. Either they produce or we'll
get some other people in.''
That unexpected outburst was rather overshadowed by a report that
George Graham would leave Arsenal this week because of his part in the
transfer which brought John Jensen to Highbury three years ago. The
source of the story was the former Tottenham player Garth Crooks, who
has a show on BBC local radio and was sticking to it yesterday despite
denials by everyone at the club.
On an afternoon of thoroughly contrasting fortunes for Arsenal, Paul
Merson marked an outstanding performance with his first goal since
returning from rehabilitation, but young midfielder Ian Selley broke a
leg in two places.
Arsenal now stand at the top of a group separated by only four points
from the relegation places, which could become even more condensed
following West Ham's home match with Everton tonight.
Swindon's new goal ace Peter Thorne stunned Bolton yesterday with a
double strike for a 2-1 first-leg lead in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final
after Alan Stubbs had put the first division leaders ahead early on.

Aberdeen 2, Rangers 0
ABERDEEN clawed themselves away from second bottom place in the
Premier League with this victory. And Pittodrie players who had failed
Willie Miller so often this season pushed caretaker manager Roy Aitken
toward a permanent role with the club.
If Aitken can continue to coax and cajole this kind of fighting
performance from his team, then the manager's job will surely be his for
keeps.
Rangers remain 14 points clear at the top of the premier division, but
this result suggests that manager Walter Smith's caution over the
championship has some foundation.
Certainly the champions returned to Glasgow last night still angry
over two penalty claims that went against them in the second half.
One came before the Aberdeen spot kick that Billy Dodds converted to
give his team the lead; the other came after it. Neither incident
convinced referee Jim McCluskey, though the second looked as if it
should certainly have been awarded.
By the end, however, Duncan Shearer had scored a second goal and
Aberdeen had taken the three points convincingly.
It was a gritty performance from Aberdeen, one which brought to mind
the manner in which their caretaker manager himself played. The result
now allows Aitken breathing space as he begins to pick up the pieces
after the sacking of Miller.
It was an important result for the new man, and it demonstrated to the
rest of the country that Rangers' relentless march towards the title can
at least be delayed.
Aberdeen fielded a team that looked equipped to attack, while Rangers
appeared to have opted for a more conservative approach. They played new
signings, Alex Cleland and Gary Bollan, in midfield, sitting in the wide
positions.
For long enough in the first half that set-up looked good enough to
allow the Ibrox men to remain at least unbeaten. And, perhaps, do
better.
Eventually, however, the game hinged on the decisions of referee
McCluskey. In 55 minutes, Charlie Miller was brought down by Stephen
Wright as he went through, but the referee waved away Rangers' penalty
claims.
Then, in 58 minutes, a pass-back from Richard Gough had Ally Maxwell
in trouble. When Shearer reached the ball the 'keeper desperately
brought him down, the penalty was given, and Dodds scored.
In 69 minutes, Brian Laudrup was pushed off the ball by John Inglis.
It looked a certain penalty this time, but once more referee McCluskey
waved away Rangers' protests.
Just last week, Rangers' boss Walter Smith was critical of decisions
that went against his team when they met Dundee United. It must have
seemed like history repeating itself yesterday.
The game had started excitingly with Maxwell holding a low shot from
Dodds and then Theo Snelders pushing away a drive from Miller.
In 30 minutes David Robertson saw a gap in the Aberdeen defence, burst
through it, and slammed in a shot only to watch in disbelief as Snelders
punched the ball away.
At this stage Rangers had the better chances but, in the second half,
it was Aberdeen who took the lead and, despite Rangers' pressure, the
Pittodrie men remained in front and added a late second.
After the interval, young Stephen Glass had taken over from Stewart
McKimmie, injured halfway through the first half. The change did not
stop Aberdeen from looking more aggressive.
In 58 minutes they stunned Rangers by going ahead from their penalty.
Four minutes later Gordon Durie replaced Bollan and the Ibrox men pushed
forward looking for the equaliser.
In 68 minutes a corner from Laudrup -- his third in rapid succession
-- found Gough. His header forward almost reached Durie just short of
the goal line, but somehow Snelders got there first with a brave save as
Durie prepared to hook the ball into the net.
Four minutes after that Basil Boli had a chance from close range, but
shot high over.
While Rangers had pressure, Aberdeen were looking dangerous when they
broke forward. There was a warning ten minutes from the end when Shearer
swept over a cross from the left and Dodds smacked a header against the
bar.
The second goal was delayed for just eight minutes. Stuart McCall
tried to be over-elaborate at the edge of his own penalty box. He was
dispossessed by Shearer, who then sent a vicious low shot past Maxwell
to confirm the Aberdeen victory.
Still not content, the burly striker almost scored a third with a long
range shot that Maxwell pushed clear.
At the end, the only demonstrations at Pittodrie came from the fans
celebrating victory.
The threatened protests against chairman Ian Donald did not take place
beforehand -- and there was certainly no room for them afterwards.

Hearts 2, Kilmarnock 2
HEARTS skipper Craig Levein gathered all the experience on the
Tynecastle's staff around him, to salvage a vital point from Kilmarnock
at rain-soaked Tynecastle.
The Scotland defender watched his team go two goals behind inside 18
minutes and then saw defender Dave McPherson and Neil Berry limp out of
the 2-2 draw.
The result was that goalscorers John Millar and Gary Mackay played out
most of the second half filling in at centre half and left back.
And it was the seasoned campaigners like Levein, that summoned up all
their wisdom to avoid what would have been a damaging defeat.
''When you consider that John is very much a forward going midfield
player and ended up at centre back, it indicated how stretched we
were,'' reflected Levein.
''And Gary came on from the bench to do a fine job in midfield, before
he was asked to fulfill a makeshift task at left back.
''It was bad enough to lose an influential player like Dave early on,
but to see Neil go out of the match as well became critical.
''It's great credit to the players that they were able to adjust to
two complete reorganisations and still take something from the game.''
It seemed as though Hearts were heading for the relegation area again,
from the tightly packed mid-table area, as Killie raced to a two-goal
lead after 18 minutes.
Goalkeeper Craig Nelson looked less than confident as Steve Maskrey
drove in a rebound from the keeper in five minutes and Tom Brown's head
glance somehow squirmed in 13 minutes later.
But the resilience that Levein inspired pulled Tommy McLean's side
back from the brink with two goals inside as many minutes to ensure an
enthralling afternoon's sport.
Stephen Frail's free kick in the 29th minute offered Millar space to
beat Drago Lekovic with his fierce header and two minutes later Mackay
ended a flowing Jim Bett-Kevin Thomas move with a sweetly struck 16 yard
shot.
Nelson made amends for his earlier uncertainty when diving to his
right to push a Tom Black penalty onto the post with 19 minutes
remaining.
The direct Ally Mitchell had earned the award by forcing Millar into a
body check, and Nelson's save meant Black was missing on his second
penalty in eight years.
''We could have won the game in the end but, in fairness to
Kilmarnock, they had their opportunities late in the match as well,''
admitted Levein.
''The great thing was that on a dreadful afternoon to be out, it was a
smashing game for the supporters, with both teams still trying to win it
right up to the death.''
Alex Totten has his players happy to attack both at home and away from
Rugby Park, and consequently they are fast shedding their label as
relegation candidates.
''It was a great start to the match for us, but we couldn't get the
third goal when we were two ahead. That would have finished things
off,'' sighed Totten.
McPherson required three stitches in a shin injury and will not face a
lengthy absence, but Berry's pain in his side is less clear-cut.
Amid fears that he had suffered a collapsed lung, the former Bolton
player went for X-rays yesterday and will know the results today, with
the hope that it's simply a muscle strain.

STENHOUSEMUIR had the unusual sight on Saturday of a queue forming
outside their Ochilview ground -- even though they were not playing. It
is all part of the Scottish cup fever which has hit the club ahead of
their clash on Saturday with Aberdeen.
With Stenhousemuir's league game at Brechin off on Saturday, the
players trained at Ochilview. And when the fans heard the news, they
arrived on the hunt for cup tickets.
Chairman Terry Bulloch said yesterday: ''Because of the intense
interest we put the tickets on sale. More will be on sale on Monday when
I expect all will be taken.''

It's Valentine's Day tomorrow and with so much love in the air the
time is ripe for Joe Donnelly to recount the incredible tale of two true
romantics who happily committed body and soul to their shared passion
and saw it flourish in the coldest of climates
A LABOUR of love became a story of love, a romance of enduring
devotion. It is a tale that rivals the Bridges of Madison County in its
warmth and its ardour. It is simply a tale of two hearts.
Sentimental? Of course it is. Schmaltz it is not.
Garth and Vicky Waite fell in love with each other, with Scotland, and
more particularly, with a rocky little island battered by gales and the
tides in the Firth of Lorne.
To get there, they crossed a bridge over the Atlantic, found their
idyll on the tiny island of Easdale, and they stayed.
Romance, almost the exclusive territory of the young and excitable,
came late for the couple, their second chance of happiness which they
grabbed with fervour. Both were in their fifties, both bereaved of their
partners, when they met by accident on holiday in Scotland.
The brief encounter, a chance meeting on a train heading for the west
coast, Garth returning to places of fine childhood memory, Vicky seeking
solitude and silence, was indeed a fateful one. It sparked an interest
which led to the exchange of names and addresses, a dawning realisation
and acceptance of affinity. In less than two years they were back in
Scotland, this time on honeymoon on their enchanted island.
That first meeting on the train, as consequential as any on the Orient
Express, led to a momentous decision simply to cut and run, to give up
their past lives and start afresh on the barren little island where no
trees grow.
The one love affair sparked another, an enduring passion for the
windblown islet on the west coast, on the far side of a unique, some say
magical, old bridge. Their affair of the heart of that first year of
their life together on Easdale is recounted in Island, their book
written in affection for their home.
It is more than a book, more than a diary. It is a remarkable
collaboration of two talents, two kindred spirits who were given a
second chance of happiness and grasped it with such zest and enthusiasm
that their love was to endure. It is hard to believe, reading this
account of their adopted island, that their book was written more than a
decade ago. It is almost 20 years since Garth and Vicky's portentious
meeting on the night train heading north.
''It was in the summer of 1975, after losing her parents, that Vicky
flew to Glasgow and joined a train at Queen Street Station bound for
Oban,'' Garth recalls. ''She entered the carriage of the open-plan
variety and, much to the astonishment of the one passenger in it,
marched the full length of the carriage to sit opposite him. His name
was Garth Waite, on his way to South Uist. Both of us were eager for
adventure.
''We talked of islands, of natural history, or music. We reached Oban
that June evening and there we parted, she for Seil Island and I for
Uist. From that time until the winter of 1976 we did not meet again.''
More than a year later Vicky telephoned Garth just before Christmas.
On New Year's Day he travelled to Hove and brought her back to his house
in Welwyn, Herts, to meet his father and his son.
''She was to have stayed two nights,'' said with elaboration. ''I
would not let her return and we were married three weeks later on
January 22, 1977.''
From that day to this, Vicky and Garth have not been apart. Later that
year, for their honeymoon, they repeated their first journey, arrived on
Easdale Island where they rented a cottage for a fortnight. On one
summer day, when Garth was fishing, his new wife crept up behind him.
''What about retiring early and coming to live here?'' Garth asked for
an hour to think about it. A month later they moved into their Scottish
home, a but-and-ben 200 years old, 55 paces from the high water mark and
facing the rising sun.
It was here that the real love affair, the passion for their island
and for the surrounding countryside, really began, culminating six years
later in the most exquisitely and lovingly produced account of their
honeymoon year. And what an enormous work it became, chronicling the
life and scenery of Easdale and Seil and every exploratory trip through
the Highlands in their caravan.
The two sympathetic hearts were also ardent lovers of nature in all
its forms. Garth has been a keen naturalist since childhood, and Vicky
was gifted with a remarkable artistic talent. Combined, their gifts
enabled them to write and lavishly illustrate the story of their life.
It leaves A Year in Provence flat, if one were to be comparative. A
year on Easdale never had the comfort or the continental flavour. It
could be fierce and stormy. That first winter was the most severe in
living memory, yet they lived through it and loved it.
In his introduction to Island, in his own hand, Garth recalls: ''Set
in these idyllic surroundings, our retirement afforded us the time and
inspiration to bring about the marriage of our ambitions. Neither of us
alone could accomplish what was attainable together. Vicky took her
brush and pencil, pen and ink and clothed my ideas with colour and
script.
''What is recorded here is the journal of our first splendid year on
Easdale. It has taken us some six years to complete. In that time,
changes have occurred, a new owner, a new ferryman, several departures,
and a number of arrivals.
''The slate heart of the island does not alter.''
Vicky and Garth are a remarkable couple by any account. She was
widowed when her RAF husband was killed in a crash in Gibraltar. Garth,
deeply religious, lost his wife after a long illness in 1974. Neither
does things by halves, as the account of their romance and instant
decision shows. Together, they proved formidable and faithful
chroniclers, building up a large and disparate family of toads, cat,
donkey, and all the wild birds that could nest in and around their
garden.
Every animal, every flower that clings to the hard rock of Easdale was
observed, described, and painted in delicate watercolours, every day
condensed into a few words, equally delicate, in Vicky's careful hand.
Each day brought a new sight, from a lone heron, ''feet in the icy
water, patiently watching for a morsel'', to four mute swans flying
above the water, or a donkey feeding on a neighbour's last daffodil.
To read Island is to learn about the wildlife of Scotland's west
coast, and to comprehend the beauty in the bleakness, but the book is
more than that, bearing, as it does, not a trace of the typographer's
art -- everything is handwritten, an Edwardian Diary, an extended
holiday postcard like that Year in Provence. It is the devotion that
unfolds in the simple statements.
April 6: Found Vicky sitting on the bank painting Celandines.
June 5: Vicky's birthday. The copse rang with birdsong and we sat and
watched a tree creeper.
Simple entries speak eloquently of a couple who found each other,
beyond the bloom and excitement of youth, and were loathe to be apart,
out of each other's sight.
THEIR happiness radiates from every page, in the marvellous paintings
and sketches of plants and animals, in the words of Browning, Burns, and
MacDiarmid which spot and punctuate the days in the most fitting of
niches.
It glows, too, in the verse written by Vicky herself, in gratitude and
in praise:
Thank you for tasting, and thank you for sight,
and always the peace that one hears in the night.
But most for a partner with giving and sharing,
Exchanging a mood for the kindest of caring.
It shouts from a gloriously detailed page of watercolour flowers
simply entitled Summer Crowd.
And it endures to the last page where Garth writes: ''New Year's Eve,
Hogmanay. Going out to feed the birds, we noticed that the sun was low
in the sky and casting long shadows. Silhouetted against the pale sky, a
flock of starlings, moving as one, swerved to alight. We turned over a
few stones to find worms for Blossom the Blackbird and went back to the
warmth of the cottage.''
It was only the end of the chapter and a new year was to begin. Some
things would change. Garth and Vicky lived on Easdale until only a few
years ago when, for health reasons, they moved to another island: Cyprus
in the Mediterranean. Publishers Mainstream, who re-issue their account
in April, have been unable to trace them. Friends on the island say that
Vicky, now in her seventies, is very frail. Both are thought to be in a
nursing home in England. Their old friends on the rocky isle speak of
them fondly and remember them well.
Some things would change, but their love endures to this day, solid as
the slate heart of the island. It does not, and never will, alter.
* Island: Diary of a Year in Easdale, Garth and Vicky Waite,
Mainstream, #14.99.

KILMARNOCK'S John Henry could find himself on the verge of
international recognition this morning, writes James Traynor. The
attacking midfielder has impressed enough to make Scotland's manager
Craig Brown consider promoting him to a level he could not have dreamed
of when he was playing with Clydebank less than a year ago.
Alex Totten paid the Kilbowie club #175,000 for the 23-year-old at the
start of this season and Henry has thrived in the premier division.
If Brown names Henry in the squad for the B international against
Northern Ireland at Easter Road on Tuesday, February 21, the player will
be in the company of Phil O'Donnell, Paul Lambert, Brian Martin, Rob
McKinnon, Darren Jackson, Keith Wright, Steven Tweed, Pat McGinlay, and
Alex Cleland.
Ally Maxwell, who will play for Rangers against Hearts in a
fourth-round Tennents Scottish Cup tie the night before the B match,
will play in goal if he escapes mishap.

HIBERNIAN manager Alex Miller has a message of cheer for Scotland fans
as they look ahead to next month's European Championship qualifying tie
against Russia in Moscow. It is simply that if Rangers' Andy Goram is
not ready for the trip then there should be no worries about the
goalkeeping position.
Speaking after watching his side earn a point against Celtic at
Hampden, Miller pointed to his own keeper and said: ''If Goram doesn't
make it, Jim Leighton is the man -- let there be no doubt about that.''
Leighton, at 36, was outstanding against Celtic, but it is the sheer
consistency of the man once dumped by Manchester United's Alex Ferguson
for an FA Cup final replay which gives Miller pleasure and satisfaction.
When the goalkeeper joined the Easter Road side from Dundee in the
summer of 1993, his career appeared to be going nowhere. After having
been dropped from the United side for the FA Cup replay against Crystal
Palace in 1990, it was all downhill.
In an attempt to ressurect his career, he returned to Scotland and
Dundee, but after only eight premier division matches for the Dens Park
side it went wrong again, ending with a loan period at Sheffield United
and a return to the Dundee reserve side.
Then came one of the few breaks Leighton had experienced in recent
years. Hibernian had lost experienced keeper John Burridge, and Miller,
with only youngsters to fill in, took the plunge and brought the former
Aberdeen and Scotland man to Easter Road.
''It wasn't a gamble,'' said Miller. ''I knew exactly what I was doing
and Jim has proved himself to be one of the best signings I have ever
made. I got him on a free transfer and look at the job he has done for
this club.''
Indeed, the transformation has been remarkable. Since going to Easter
Road, the keeper has played in every competitive match -- 80 of them in
all -- and there isn't anyone in the premier division who can equal him
for consistency. He has strung together 69 consecutive league
appearances and 30 shut-outs in all matches.
Said Miller: ''Jim is a first-class professional and a credit to
himself and his family for the way he has handled all the
disappointments.
''Players like Jim Leighton don't suddenly lose their ability. He was
a tremendous success for Aberdeen, Manchester United, and Scotland, but
when he was at Dundee people were saying he couldn't do this or couldn't
do that. There were even those who said he couldn't handle the new
pass-back rule. All that was wrong was that he had lost his confidence.
''He needed a boost in that direction, and I had faith in him. He has
repaid that many times over. We have two young keepers at Easter Road,
Chris Reid and Jason Gardiner, both of them under-21 caps, and it must
be frustrating for them, but they can't shift Jim.
''I, for one, would have no worries if Jim had to face the Russians
next month. After Goram, I know he is the man for the job, but what is
more important, Craig Brown knows it, too.''

LIFE'S tough at the top, but just ask Norrie McWhirter what it's like
at the bottom, writes Hugh McKinlay. No whirl of Saturday night
socialising for the 25-year-old St Mirren skipper in his beloved
Paisley.
He said: ''The team's doing so badly that when I leave the ground, I
just go home and stay there, and think about the game until going back
to work again on Monday. Everyone thinks it's just a game. It's not.
It's our livelihood. We turn up at work on a Monday the same as everyone
else.''
Despite his relatively tender years, McWhirter is a 10-year veteran at
Love Street, and happily admits, despite his team's present plight, that
he is ''a St Mirren man''.
He added: ''I supported this club when I was younger, and I don't like
to see them doing badly. Now I'm the captain as well, and you don't want
to lead a team that is being beaten every week. You have
responsibilities and you must show them on the park.
''It's all down to getting results now. One result -- even a draw to
pick up a point now and again -- would get us going.''
The great threatened walk-out by fans in protest against St Mirren's
displays did not help either. We were hyped up just before the match. I
could not wait to get started.''
In the end, though, the walk-out not only failed to materialise, but
the few who did leave prompted the main body of the fans to cheer even
louder for their team despite their defeat by Raith Rovers.
As the rain hammered down, Noah's Ark came to mind. All aboard two by
two, and all that. In Love Street's case, they splashed out two by two,
and only just more than a dozen of them out of a crowd of 2600.
''I knew they would stay on and cheer the team. I did not think they
would walk out. It was just the fans making a statement before the game.
We were showing 100% effort on the field, and if the fans see that,
they're quite happy,'' said McWhirter.
Towards the end, there were more chants for manager Jimmy Bone to
quit, but McWhirter is adamant: ''The gaffer's the man for the job, and
does a good job in my book. I live in Paisley, and I can see that people
are gutted with the way the team is doing.
''It means a lot to them and it's up to the players to get the
results. Jimmy Bone will pick us up. He will get us going again.''
Lack of goals, as well as giving away daft ones, are the main problem
for Saints, and it seemed a pity that McWhirter could not even enjoy the
fact that he scored his first of the season on Saturday.
He merely followed the usual plan. He went quietly home.

JUNIOR ROUND-UP
ARTHURLIE, a goal down at half-time, came back with goals from
Hendrie, Gardiner, Cairney and Tony McDonald to beat Glencairn 4-2 -- a
result which closed the gap on leaders Pollok in Central region's Reebok
League.
Pollok, meanwhile, reached the fourth round of the Whyte &amp; McKay Cup
against a disappointing Baillieston team with goals by Grainger (two),
Paisley, Mills, and Sinclair.
Scotland junior manager -- Denis Gray -- was an interested spectator
at the Shettleston v Petershill game. He couldn't help but be impressed
with Nelson and Smith of Shettleston and full back Walker of Petershill.
The game ended 2-1 to Shettleston, who led through goals from
ex-Clydebank players Paddy Kelly and Martin Nelson (penalty).
Petershill's late rally was led by full back Walker, who scored with a
diving header with five minutes remaining. Ex-Ranger Phil Bonnyman was a
late sub for Petershill. These three points leave Shettleston fourth in
the Reebok Premier Division.
In the Ayrshire region's Western League, Glenafton moved into second
position after coming from behind to beat Irvine Meadow 2-1. Cumnock's
6-0 defeat of Kello Rovers put them into second place in the second
division -- two points behind leaders Ardeer but with two games in hand.
In the East region, Bathgate scraped through in the Whyte &amp; McKay Cup
against Crossgates after having been 2-1 down. Goals by McFait and
Strange levelled the game for Bathgate. Nicol made amends for an earlier
penalty miss by scoring the winner.
Newtongrange's 1-0 win over Armadale helped them close the gap on
league leaders Camelon.
One-and-a-half games beat the weather in the Tayside region. Arbroath
SC beat Kinnoull 1-0 to leave Kinnoull deep in relegation trouble. In
the other AT and T League game, Tayport were leading 1-0 against
Montrose Roselea at half-time only for their game to be abandoned.
In the North region, Sunnybank's defeat of Lads Club in the Centenary
Trophy takes them through to a third-round tie against Bankfoot
Athletic.
FC Stoneywood stretched their unbeaten run to 11 games and their lead
at the top of the premier division to two points following their 1-0
defeat of Hall Russell.
Lewis United, in the last 16 of the OVD Scottish Cup and lying second
bottom of the premier division, lost at home to Bon Accord.
Formartine's draw at Banks o' Dee puts them three points ahead of
Hermes in the first division.
FC Stoneywood, for the fourth time this season, were the premier
division's team of the month for January and in the first division Lads
Club picked up the award.

St Mirren 1, Raith Rovers 2
CALL it the fickle side of football, but as Raith Rovers rolled
mercilessly into joint top spot in the first division and St Mirren
plunged deeper into relegation trouble because of the Fifers' 2-1 win at
Love Street, the man who has become a folk hero in Fife was sitting in
the stand.
The simple fact of the matter is that Gordon Dalziel was dropped. ''So
what?'' is the cry. He's not the first top name to suffer that problem,
and won't be the last.
But when Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl says that he's concerned that
goal difference could be a deciding factor in what is now turning into
one heck of a promotion race, then a swift look at statistics is on the
menu.
Dalziel has scored 17 goals in 26 games -- which is only three less
than the entire St Mirren squad have scored in the league all season --
and, of course, it was his ''headed'' equaliser at Ibrox which spurred
Raith to Coca-Cola Cup glory.
Dalziel, himself, remained diplomatic. ''I was told to put on a heavy
coat and sit in the stand. Of course, I'm disappointed. If I did not
feel that way, I would hang up my boots. I'll just have to wait and see
what Jimmy Nicholl says on Monday.''
After Steve Crawford's two goals had been enough to sink St Mirren at
soggy Love Street, Nicholl said: ''Now that we're up there, I should be
pleased. But we should have scored more than two, and then we gave away
a goal near the end. Goals difference definitely will be taken into
account at the end of the season.''
But what of Dalziel, who has scored 184 times for Raith since 1987?
Nicholl said: ''Yes, Dalziel was dropped. The fact that he has to suffer
this week shows how well Steve Crawford is playing. That's five goals in
four games for him. Then there's David Narey, who can't get a place, and
Colin Cameron, who can only star on the bench. It proves how well we're
doing when you have players like that who can't get a game.''
On Raith's ninth straight win -- eight of them in the league -- he
added: ''We must keep getting the points. We face a horrific finish to
the season with our last five games against Airdrie, Dundee, St
Johnstone, Dunfermline, and Hamilton.''
Saints manager Jimmy Bone would love to have Nicholl's worries. Ayr's
victory against leaders Dundee not only tightened the promotion race, it
put the Paisley men a step nearer relegation.
But Bone refused to criticise his side too heavily. ''You cannot give
away early goals and hope to win a game. Our effort and commitment was
good, but we're playing without any confidence, and losing that goal
just before half-time to go in 2-0 down certainly did not help.''
Bone, who praised the fans for remaining loyal despite the threatened
walk-out, added: ''Ayr's victory now makes it that wee bit more
difficult, but there are still 11 games to go, and we have the ability.
The players won't lose that, but we must try to cut out the errors and
get more belief in ourselves.''
Scotland Under-21 internationalist Crawford -- who will be named today
in the Scotland B squad for next week's game against Northern Ireland --
certainly looked sharp, converting a Shaun Dennis flick after only four
minutes, and then taking advantage of a bad pass-back by Martin Baker to
score what proved to be the killer goal seconds before the interval.
Brave goalkeeping by Campbell Money and some slackness on his own part
denied Crawford what should have been at least a hat trick.
As Bone said, the effort from Saints was there for all to see, but the
vital spark which can mean the difference between success and failure is
definitely missing.
Being second to the ball for the majority of the afternoon is a polite
way of showing how much the young Saints were out-classed.
Skipper Norrie McWhirter scored his first goal of the season a minute
from time, but by then, there was no way back for Saints.

CHRISTOPHER Columbus seems tame by comparison.
Forty-two-year-old former French naval diver Guy Delage walked ashore
in Barbados, and in surprisingly good shape, after becoming the first
person to swim nearly 2000 miles -- alone -- across the Atlantic.
A solitary French flag had been planted in the sand. His wife
Catherine and his son Clement were in the water to greet him. Police
held back a crowd of several hundred, while television crews and
journalists came to blows for the privilege of the first words and
pictures of a man who for two months had enjoyed only the company of
fish.
Delage hoped to join the ranks of France's other great solitary
eccentrics such as Louis Bleriot, who flew across the Channel in 1909,
and navigator Alain Bombard, who crossed the Atlantic in 1952 in an
inflatable dinghy. But by remaining embarrassingly silent about Delage's
exploit, leading sportsmen and scientists have appeared to condemn it.
Barely back on dry land, Delage has plunged into a snide controversy
about the genuine worth and scientific interest of his marathon swim.
Delage set off from Cape Vert, off the coast of West Africa, on
December 16, pushing a small inflated raft, containing food and drink
and carrying a rifle for shooting sharks. The latter was used in the
fight between journalists after his arrival in Barbados.
He swam between six and eight hours a day, towing a dinghy on which he
slept at night. His specially designed goggles gave him 180 degrees
vision and special flippers provided 30% extra thrust. His wetsuit also
had been designed for the swim, using materials which provided both
considerable freedom of movement and exceptional insulation.
Delage was criticised from the outset for the use of the dinghy which,
by bobbing along on the current, pushed him towards Latin America at no
effort.
He was caricatured in the press. Had he not spent the first two days
of the crossing huddling on his dinghy, struggling with seasickness? Had
he not then cut his fingers, opening a can of sausages and beans? The
anti-shark rifle caused hilarity although Delage did claim he frightened
off a shark by hitting it on the nose with a flipper.
Only days into the swim, Delage's monitoring equipment broke down,
meaning that little scientific information about his general health,
physical performance and resistance to so many hours in the sea --
information often used as justification for the crossing -- was
broadcast back to France.
When Delage arrived in Barbados, he provoked suspicion by leaving his
dinghy out of sight, claiming the water was too shallow to bring it into
shore. Reporters, hoping to see a haggard figure struggling half dead to
dry land, were disappointed to see Delage walk up the beach quite
normally, once again accustomed to gravity.
Psychiatrists consulted by several newspapers about the former navy
officer's transatlantic performance tended to come down on his side.
One, Dr Michele Reynaud, ruled out suggestions Delage was insane and
compared his achievement to other, highly unusual but less publicised
feats of endurance such as mountain climbing -- cold, painful,
punishing, and for some, deeply rewarding.
Another, Dr Eric Piel, was more circumspect. He said that anyone who
wanted to swim across the Atlantic must have relational difficulties,
and that all Delage's talk of scientific experimentation was a
smokescreen. In reality, he just enjoyed doing it.
For this was far from being Delage's first publicity grabbing exploit.
Aged 18, he swam across the Channel, apparently to impress a girlfriend
living in England.
In 1978, he came first in the Route du Rhum boat race, sailing a
12-metre boat he had designed himself. In 1981, he came second in the
New York to Brest boat race. In 1991, he flew alone across the Atlantic
in an ultralight aircraft, but failed to attract the media attention he
was after.
The Legion d'Honneur medal, France's highest award, may still be out
of sight. But there is no doubt that Delage enjoyed himself in his own
unusual way.
''Having experienced terror in an ultralight aircraft, I wanted to
experience pain. It is better to die in the jaws of a shark than in
bed,'' he said.

INVESTMENT bank Kleinwort Benson is understood in a report expected
today to forecast that UK house prices will rise only at the level of
inflation over the next five years and will not increase at all in real
terms.
The report goes much further than any other assessment of the housing
market with most of the major housing forecasters, including the Halifax
and Nationwide building societies, confining themselves to the outlook
for the current year. On this basis, house prices are projected to rise
by about 2% to 3% in 1995, mirroring retail prices.
Kleinwort says, though, that house prices have not yet completed the
correction that began in 1989 when average house prices peaked at more
than 10 times per-capita national income. They have since fallen back to
7.5 times income but Kleinwort considers that they will fall to 6.5
times income between now and 1999. It draws a parallel with the 1950s
when house prices fell in real terms for 10 years.
All are agreed that the housing market remains, at best, flat with no
real evidence of recovery. Housing analysts at NatWest Securities have
suggested that house price inflation will eventually reappear but
suspect that it will not be until after the next election that a
material rise in prices is experienced.
In the meantime, low wage growth, low employment growth, high real
interest rates and faltering consumer confidence are expected to hold
down house prices. Furthermore, the analysts say, the UK housing market
has never had to cope with rising mortgage rates at the same time as a
lack of price momentum within the market.
Kleinwort also warns that demographic trends are very negative. An
aversion to taking on debt is still widespread, job insecurity has grown
and the tax system is much less favourable for house purchase. And, of
course, interest rates are on their way up at a time when there are
difficulties enough in the housing market.

THAT familiar old condition, Scottish Cup fever, broke out in alarming
fashion in Huntly yesterday. The Highland League club with a habit of
going on giant-killing runs put their tickets on sale for the impending
clash with holders Dundee United -- and within an hour their allocation
was sold out.
Some fans had queued for almost two hours to secure a share of the
2000 briefs.
They would have been happy enough to get up early anyway, having seen
their team take another important step towards a second consecutive
championship. Huntly won 3-0 at challengers Elgin City thanks to goals
from Brian Thomson, his thirtieth of the season, and a double from Gary
Whyte.
Deveronvale debut defender Stewart Cameron had to be rushed to
hospital during the match against Buckie Thistle. The 19-year-old
suffered heart palpitations only five minutes into the game and was
taken to the cardiac unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
Vale player-manager Kevin Bremner said: ''Obviously, it's a bit of a
worry, but it's happened to him before and he knew what to do.''
Doctors are still not sure what causes the problem, but Cameron's
footballing future is not thought to be in danger.
Bremner and Ross McLean both hit hat tricks as Vale routed Buckie 6-0.
Sammy Leonce gave Forres an early lead at Brora Rangers, but they had
to settle for a draw after having two players sent off.
Neil Nicol was red-carded for bringing down Brora's David Ross, who
got up to equalise from the resulting penalty. Then Andy Mathieson was
sent off for a second bookable offence only minutes after coming on as a
sub.
In the only other Highland game to survive the weather, Fort William
won through to the semi-finals of the North Cup after becoming the first
team this season to beat Caley Thistle reserves. Mike McEachan and Tom
Drummond set Fort on the way to a 2-0 win.

End of a Rolls-Royce lifestyle
As a union delegation flies out today to convince German colleagues at
BMW Rolls-Royce that RR's planned redundancies in East Kilbride could
pose a threat to their future, GAVIN BELL talks to two men whose hopes
for their families and their lifestyles have been already blighted by
the news. Where do they go from here?
THE Rolls-Royce plant in East Kilbride was opened on November 20,
1953, by the then Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. The 60,000 sq ft
complex was built in 15 months and was the town's biggest single
industrial unit at the time. It opened with 2600 employees, most of them
Scots, and there were plans to increase the workforce to 3,500 in the
following year.
Last month the company confirmed that it is to close its engineering
research and development facility at East Kilbride, and transfer the
work to Bristol and Derby. It said it needed to cut costs to compete in
the aero-engine market, and announced that 500 designers and engineers
and 100 shopfloor and store workers would be paid off. The rundown is
expected to begin in May and be completed by the end of the year,
leaving 1,000 jobs at the East Kilbride plant.
Almost half of the town's population of 70,000 is employed locally,
and the jobless rate of 7% is below national and regional levels -- but
the ratio of job seekers to vacancies is still 6:1.
THE DESIGN ENGINEER
We fear Bob won't find work in the area and we will be split up.
WHEN Bob McCallum landed a job with Rolls-Royce as a design engineer,
he felt he had stepped firmly on to the ladder of a successful career.
He resigned his position with Volvo trucks in Irvine, and was grateful
when his new employer helped him find a pleasant three-bedroomed
terraced house in East Kilbride for his young family.
After four years with the company, he bought the rented house last
November, and spent #5000 installing central heating and new windows,
and redecorating. At Christmas, he told his wife Karen that things were
looking good. He was earning steady overtime on an urgent project, and
maybe they could take the children on a Spanish holiday this year.
In the RR drawing offices, he was impressed by the team spirit of his
colleagues working on the successful V2500 engines.
But the illusions of security and relative affluence vanished abruptly
on the morning of January 19. A Herald report had alerted Bob to
impending staff cuts, but he was ''absolutely gobsmacked'' when he
learned the extent of them. The news was broken to 120 staff in Z block,
the development design and administration centre, by Keith Bradshaw,
chief design engineer. ''The room was dead silent,'' Bob recalls.
''Keith was quite emotional, saying he couldn't believe it and he was as
shocked as we were. I was devastated. I'd always thought Rolls-Royce was
as safe as you could get, that it was a job for life. Bob decided not to
phone his wife. ''I thought it would be better to wait till I got home,
so I could sit her down and give her a cup of tea and tell her not to
worry, that I'd find something else. She was very good about it, though
I couldn't hide that I was worried.
''But the full impact didn't sink in that first day. I suppose I was
in a state of shock. Even the next morning when I woke up, I thought:
did I dream that?
''We've always been very proud of what we do, but it's hard to
maintain any enthusiasm for a company that no longer wants or needs
you,'' Bob says. ''I've still got work on my drawing board, and I still
attend meetings, but . . .''
His voice trails off, and he stares into space. ''The commitment has
gone. ''It's been kicked out of us. Some feel we should try and fight
this decision, and there's no doubt the union has a very strong case,
but I don't see the management changing course.
''A few of the guys say they're going to hang on to get full
redundancy, but I don't think that's sensible. The job market in my
profession is fairly fluid just now, but God knows what it'll be like in
September when there are hundreds looking for work. I'd rather get
another job now if I can, and plan the future.''
So, instead of browsing through Iberian holiday brochures, the
McCallums are spending the winter months scanning the ''situations
vacant'' columns. With his skills and experience, Bob is hopeful of
finding new employment, but there are no guarantees in an uncertain
economic climate, and he fears he may have to uproot his family again.
Karen says: ''Our big worry is that Bob won't find work in the area,
and the family will be split up. The problem is we can't sell the house
for two years because we bought it at a discount, so if Bob has to work
far away he'll have to go on his own. That's the worst of it, the
uncertainty. What's going to happen to us?''

THE 77 top directors of privatised electricity companies have awarded
themselves share options worth a total of #72m, according to Labour
Party research published last night.
Labour claimed that the figure amounted to a charge of just above #4
for every household in the country.
The figures show that 12 directors, together with a small number of
senior executives at the generating companies PowerGen and National
Power have options worth #22,901,856 between them.

OH dear. What has happened to the Novosibirsk Philharmonic Orchestra
since its last visit to Glasgow some years ago?
An orchestral personality transplant? Jet lag? Were we sent the
reserve squad for what was one of the poorest concerts given by any
visiting orchestra since the Glasgow hall opened five years ago?
There was almost no resemblance between the way the Siberian orchestra
played last night and on its previous visit.
I recall the sound -- big, attacking, red-blooded, full-bodied. This
wasn't even a pale shadow. The entire night was a catalogue of
disappointments.
I have never heard Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kije Suite played with such
diffidence and lack of bite; it was almost tentative -- it actually
suggested (a suspicion that returned throughout a desperate evening) a
total lack of confidence in the direction of conductor Arnold Katz.
Next disappointment: the cancellation (without explanation) of
Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto. The substitute, Shostakovich's Second,
is a brilliant piece, true. But alas it was not played that way.
Pianist Paul Crossley, usually tight and incisive, seemed to lack the
steely brilliance the music requires. The slow movement brought the one
genuinely lovely moment of the evening.
Those of us who had heard the band last time round clung onto the hope
that Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition in the second half would see
the Siberians galvanised.
'Fraid not: stiff-necked, monochrome, rotten orchestral balance, and
some ropy playing.
Arnold Katz has been in charge of this orchestra for nearly 40 years.
That's a long time. Maybe it's too long. The orchestra sounded low key,
grim, and demoralised.

RANGERS, like Old Firm rivals Celtic, are ready to plunder the
value-for-money Dutch transfer market as they bid to strengthen their
squad for next season's assault on Europe.
Walter Smith, who watched his side go down 2-0 to Roy Aitken's
revitalised Aberdeen at Pittodrie yesterday, has earmarked Rob Mackaay,
the teenage star of Vitesse Arnhem and a protege of former Dutch star
Franz Thijssen.
Mackaay will not be 20 until next month, but already he is tipped for
full international honours with Holland. Thijssen, whose skills graced
the English first division, has personally coached the youngster since
he joined Vitesse from Nijmegen two years ago.
The man who is now a member of the backroom staff with the Arnhem club
admits: ''His talents are amazing. He has played for the Olympic team
already and it is only a matter of time before he moves into the full
national side.''
Arnhem know of Rangers' interest and are ready to slap a #2m price tag
on the forward. I understand the Scottish champions have watched the
player several times this season with assistant manager Archie Knox and
coach Billy Kirkwood both making hush-hush visits to Holland.
Mackaay can play in any of the front positions but his performances
wide on the right have impressed the Ibrox spies.
A source in Holland explained to me last night: ''Initially, it was
thought Rangers were watching Glen Helder, who may be signing for
Arsenal. Then we realised that Mackaay was their target.
''He is a very direct player, and the work Franz Thijssen has put in
on his coaching is now paying off. Rangers have seen this early and they
are first in line to buy the player.''
Rangers manager Walter Smith has Jesper Blomquist of Gothenburg
already in his sights, but now Mackaay has joined the Swede on the
Rangers' shopping list.
Celtic, of course, have already signed giant striker Pierre van
Hooydonk from Holland, and manager Tommy Burns has claimed that the fees
there are much more realistic than, for instance, England.
However, though Swedish captain Jonas Thern insists that he wants to
play his football at Ibrox next season, he will not be in Glasgow for
signing talks this week.
Meanwhile, Aberdeen's caretaker manager Aitken immediately set his
players fresh targets following their defeat of the champions.
For Aitken, ever-demanding as a player, is clearly going to carry that
trait into his management career.
Last night he was clearly happy to get the victory, but happier still
to move up two places in the Premier League.
Now he wants his team to continue a surge up the table and away from
the relegation threat which brought Willie Miller the sack.
After the match he pointed out: ''We jumped two places in the league
with this win.
''But it is more important for us to look at the other places which
could be jumped in the coming weeks!''
He added: ''It would be nit-picking to talk about penalty decisions.
We deserved to win.
''I told the players before the game that if they gave me their best
then that would be enough to win the match. They have proved in the past
that they are a good side. Now we have to continue to make progress.''
Disappointed Rangers manager Smith revealed: ''Trevor Steven was
injured in training on Saturday morning. He has a hip injury and it
would have been impossible for him to play at Pittodrie. We hope to have
him back for the Cup game against Hearts.
''We have no complaints about the result though I would say the
penalty turned the game.''
The demonstrations which some Aberdeen fans had threatened came to
nothing. At the end there were some chants of Willie Miller's name but
the victory really took any heat out of protests which might have been
aimed at the chairman Ian Donald.

STEPHEN Innes is in revolt. Against style and against preconceptions
about disability, not least those that tend to be projected by the
disabled themselves.
Innes, 29, a disabled photographer, whose first exhibition is showing
at the Project Ability gallery, issued a press statement that has an
edge to it. He declared himself ''fed up'' with the ''hackneyed image''
of disabled people. Exhibitions of work by disabled people, he said,
tended to show what a rotten time they were all having, their work
portraying a sense of anger, rejection, or isolation.
''Well you won't get that from me,'' he stated, though in conversation
at the opening of his exhibition, he confided he was a little concerned
about being seen as stroppy.
''Even still,'' he said, ''getting into the Necropolis at night
through a hole in the gates, and climbing up to the top with tons of
equipment to get a picture of Glasgow Cathedral, while wondering if
you're going to be mugged, does require a certain physical dexterity and
determination.''
Innes's revolt against style is hinted at in the title of his
exhibition -- Dye Hard. Is this Bruce Willis with a Canon? ''Not at
all,'' he laughed, confessing a penchant for ''dreadful puns''. (His
photograph of a shaggily golden Highland bull, which has found fame as a
postcard, is entitled Matted d'Or.)
''My main problem with photography exhibitions is that black and white
has enjoyed a resurgence to the point that it has become de rigueur,''
he said. Innes's favoured form of photography is the colour slide.
''It's such an exacting discipline; one mistake and the slide is
ruined.''
Some of the photos in his exhibition -- a wide-ranging display of 23
pictures -- suggest trickery or clever use of filters: a spectacularly
dramatic night portrait of the Forth Rail Bridge, or the witty and
whimsical Ghost Bus, another night portrait, where the spirit of a
number 62D on the Clydeside expressway has been left imprinted after the
bus has moved on.
Not so. Innes eschews filters. ''They're a pain in the backside; they
give internal reflections and detract from the finished effect.'' His
effects are all achieved by timed exposures: ''that and the inherent
ability of the lens. All my lenses I've known for a long time; each has
a slightly different signature and I know its ability.''
By day Stephen Innes mans a BBC Radio Helpline (''I'm a grease
monkey'') and by night you're likely to find him clambering up a
near-unassailable height in search of his next target, armed with his
indispensable Canon F1n and Mamiya C330. Loaded of course. Dye Hard
indeed.
* Dye Hard, sponsored by Studio Trust, is at the Project Ability
Centre, 18 Albion Street, 10am to 5pm Monday to Friday until March 3.

Glasgow's gallery street is booming -- but does the budget stretch to
the art?
AFTER five years in Glasgow's High Street, Street Level, the city's
only specialist photography venue, is installed in its new home at the
corner of King Street and Parnie Street with its first members' show
Momentary Views: Contemporary Images From The Landscape.
Situated below Glasgow Print Studio and beside Transmission Gallery,
both well-known internationally, it now forms a block which is ''the
cultural quarter of Glasgow'', according to a university sociologist who
wrote to Transmission's Will Bradley recently.
Street Level must be rejoicing. It has a prime site with glossy
gallery and extra darkrooms, colour film processing room, library, and
offices. However the exhibition disappoints. Most of the images are very
dull: untitled, small, grey, confused, confusing, vacant, and
communicate little to the viewer. Once again bricks and mortar have
superseded the art.
It's a perennial problem. Good graduates are ambitious, dedicated, and
want to keep working in their chosen medium: sculpture, print, paint,
photography, whatever. Equipment is too expensive to buy individually so
they form a group. Then they need premises -- so artists turn into
administrators to make it happen, learning how to fill in forms and deal
with builders, plumbers, council officials, and the dreaded VAT. Soon
the art is out of the window while inevitable bureaucracy slides in
under the door. This may happen in other professions, but usually not at
the start of careers.
You would think by now, with the plethora of artists' workshops,
studios, and galleries springing up all over the place, there should be
a way of employing adminstrators to adminstrate. But then they wouldn't
work for peanuts like artists do, would they?
I am a great admirer of Street Level. In small premises they did
wonderful things, putting on good shows and providing excellent
facilities and an enterprising education programme. I'm sure they will
do so again. Meantime top photographers have been too busy painting
walls to make prints -- and also too busy to chase and cajole less
committed members who grumble about lack of recognition but never get
round to submitting work.
Street Level's director, Martha McCulloch, was Glasgow Art School's
very first fine art photo graduate back in 1984. She and her team,
mostly volunteers, have relocated to a #200,000 new home with a mere
#75,000 to achieve #148,000 worth of renovation and conversion. How?
''By negotiating half-price materials; getting the donation of
professional services and volunteer labour, and using folk doing
community service to do the joinery.'' She admits their timing was bad.
''The Scottish Arts Council's Housing the Arts fund is running down and
lottery money is not yet onstream.'' Street Level's SAC grant has been
increased by #5000 to #46,000 for 1995/96 but, with three times the
space, that won't go far.
Are they being too ambitious? ''There are hundreds of camera clubs but
none has similar facilities,'' says McCulloch.
Philosophically the exhibitions reads well: ''Land in panorama or in
minute detail; as dispassionate topography or as metaphor . . . a
fundamental fusion of time and space.'' The reality is otherwise with
most of the 25 members represented showing precocious bits of sky, oddly
angled twigs, or glimpses of blurred horizon. There is little to look
at, little to get your teeth into; too many clever shadows, too few
memorable images.
There are exceptions. John McManus's junk vernacular roadside fence
made from oil drums and any old iron; Annette Heyer's giant fingers
twisting twine; Stewart Shaw's Glasgow 1990 showing what's left of the
old Glasgow Print Studio facade in Ingram Street; Kathleen Little's
running, falling nude; Kevin McCourt's Sierra Nevada overlaid with blue
rectangulars.
McCulloch herself shows a fascinating compilation of ancient Irish map
and shoreline border. Its significance for her lies in her Irish/Scots
ancestry, and how her family's migration reflects a bigger history.
Notable too are colour shots taken by Eric Botfield, Mary Birse, and
Marion McDonald as part of a project at Cowglen Hospital. After all the
monochromatic telegraph poles and tarmac, they at least concern
themselves with the stuff of landscape: green grass, leaves, and
flowers.
In 1989 the artists-run Transmission Gallery next door was still on an
arts council grant of #5700. ''We couldn't afford to print posters,''
says Will Bradley.
Now with #25,000 from the SAC, its funding is still modest. ''But we
don't pay salaries, so we end up with enough to run an exciting
programme,'' he explains. Why are these young artists prepared to work
unpaid for two years? ''It's a really good way of being involved:
worthwhile and rewarding. We learn a lot of new skills and, as the
committee of five rotates, we learn from the others.''
The formula has worked exceedingly well. Now 11 years old,
Transmission has a worldwide reputation. The ''others'' include Borland,
Gordon, Roberts, and Roddy Buchanan (who shows at Glasgow Print Studio
in March). Indeed most of Scotland's top young artists now have
connections with Transmission.
Transmission's reputation entices famous folk like American Lawrence
Weiner and Chilean Eugenio Dittborn to show with them and I was much
impressed by Dittborn's January exhibition. Making Out, till February
18, is less coherent if not a bit ramshackle, but as all nine exhibitors
are just out of college, perhaps that's not surprising. Four cities --
Berlin, Paris, London, and Glasgow -- are represented. Glasgow is way
ahead: Joanne Tatham and Tom O'Sullivan photograph each other in strange
landscapes bathed in unnatural light; Brigid Teehan also uses
photography, via 1970s found images.
Video is a notoriously difficult medium and neither effort here is
memorable although Ward Pilarsky's notion of low budget special effects
via marshmallows and blow-torch is a nice idea. Mark Jones's long-legged
chair works better than his carpet tiles while Tim Marr's scrawled magic
marker text I am a Hotel; I am a Weekend reminds us, as if we could
forget, that the 1990s is the era when Glasgow's Centre for Contemporary
Arts would have us believe that even suicide notes constitute art.

Islamabad, Sunday
MADONNA and Michael Jackson should be tried in Pakistan as terrorists,
a religious party official demanded today.
''Michael Jackson and Madonna are the torchbearers of American
society, their cultural and social values,'' said Party of Islam
spokesman Nematullah Khan.
''They are ruining the lives of thousands of Muslims and leading them
to destruction, away from their religion, ethics and morality.''
His outburst follows the arrest of a suspect in the bombing of the
World Trade Centre in New York, Ramzi Yousef, who was seized last
Tuesday at a hotel in Islamabad and extradicted to New York.
The New York blast in February 1993 left six dead and 1000 injured.
The Islamic party local chief also called on Britain and Sweden to
extradite authors Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin, both accused by
hardline Muslims of insulting Islam and both threatened with death.
''These people have hurt the feelings and religious beliefs of
millions of Muslims all over the world,'' said Khan.
The Party of Islam, which is fiercely anti-American, barely manages to
win three or four parliamentary seats in elections in Pakistan. However
political leaders are wary of them because of their ability to mobilise
public opinion.
Meanwhile, the official Iranian news agency Irna issued a
clarification today, dropping a reference to an alleged call by a deputy
minister for the killing of British novelist Salman Rushdie.
However, Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi said in remarks quoted
by Irna that the religious edict, or fatwa, that Iran's late leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued for killing Rushdie could not be
revoked.
The rare clarification highlights the fine line the Tehran government
is treading over the Rushdie affair which has marred its relations with
several Western countries.
Last Thursday, reporting from Paris where Vaezi had a stopover on his
way home from Denmark, Irna said he ''underlined the need for the
implementation of the fatwa against the writer of the blasphemous book
The Satanic Verses' (Rushdie)'' in an interview with the agency.
Today Irna said because ''different interpretations'' had been made of
that report, it was publishing the full text of Vaezi's reply to a
question about his talks in Denmark:
''In my meetings with the Danish officials, I explicitly expressed the
stance of the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) in this regard. I
emphasised that the fatwa issued on Rushdie is based on Islamic
principles and has received the confirmation of the Islamic states at
the OIC (Organisation of the Islamic Conference) foreign ministers'
conference and is therefore irrevocable.''
Iran has repeatedly said the edict, issued almost exactly six years
ago, is a purely religious matter, unrelated to the Iranian government.
Senior Iranian leaders have said Tehran would not actively pursue
Rushdie, 47.--AP/Reuter.

David Belcher meets pop culture's Renaissance man, Bob Last.
GALVANISING has long been a good word to describe the electric Bob
Last. For the past 15 years he has been inducing sudden and startling
responses across popular culture's widest spectrum from his Edinburgh
base. Beginning in the music business, he founded Fast Product in order
to ''play around with people's expectations; introduce what are seen as
difficult ideas into what is popular and commercial . . . but without
seeking to popularise them, which I see as twee and condescending.
''Back then, in the punk era, it was all about turning your back on
business, but at Fast the creation of record sleeves and the subversion
of notions about management and marketing were as much fun as making
music. You could make just as many points with them.''
Scotland's pointed riposte to a set of questions raised but never
answered by Malcolm McLaren, Bob Last initially piloted the Rezillos to
chart success before hitting the pop jackpot with the Human League, ABC,
Scritti Politti, and Heaven 17. ''Being in the music business was always
an accident, and five or six years ago I decided I'd had enough fun and
there was nothing left to do but get rich -- and I'd already done that.
''Made a lot of money and lost a lot of money. I'd worked with pop
stars who'd defined a moment -- and how do you deal with continually
recreating it? It's a nightmare.''
Given an entre by his music interests, Last was led into film, art,
and TV. Film-wise, he has most recently supervised the music for Orlando
and Backbeat, the Beatles bio-pic. He is sound-supervisor for BBC's
Cardiac Arrest. With the BFI's Colin McCabe, he has spent the past two
years co-producing a large pan-global series of TV documentaries on the
centenary of cinema, each documentary being directed by stellar names
including Stephen Frears, Jean Luc Godard, George Miller, and Martin
Scorsese.
And Bob Last has also been creating art installations, the most recent
of which, Fear, has newly opened in Edinburgh's Collective Gallery.
Fittingly, two newly-galvanised 6ft sheet-metal Greek letters -- alpha
and omega -- form part of the work, the bulk of which exists as moving
projections on the gallery's walls.
Ceaseless water droplets; repetitious film loops. What are we to make
of them? If we choose to make a bit of an effort to make something of
them, we are free to make of them what we will, is Last's gnomic credo.
''There's no definitive, 'correct' understanding, in the same way that
one of pop's strengths is the personal interpretation that fans have of
music or place on a performer. Struggling to say what something means .
. . it's obnoxious.
''You could look at my use of alpha and omega as simple images or
portentous ones. As ever, I'm playing around with people's expectations.
There's a lot of stuff about time in the installation. Galvanising a
metal defeats the effects of time, so maybe the letters are clues for a
way in to the rest of the work. Yet simultaneously, I see a challenge in
the way art is continually used to embody a definitive, overwhelming
statement. I am much more ironic.
''So while the water droplets in my video are an endless repetition,
water eventually evaporates. Or maybe watching the trickling droplets is
simply like watching a lava lamp. Maybe they give you a different
perspective, maybe not. The whole can be an unsettling environment if
you let it. Or calming. Pretty, or contemplative, or threatening, like
the evil drops in the eyeball-slashing sequence in Un Chien Andalou.
''And the repetition is important, in that you can take everything in
at a glance without having to look for half-an-hour. In the same way, a
child's repetition of a word can stop it meaning anything. I've found
that with video art, people impose literal demands that they don't with
still pieces of art, probably due to their exposure to TV. With Fear,
I'm not telling any stories. I'm showing that there are non-narrative
ways of using moving images.''
Bob Last will next be involved in the narrative use of moving images
as Hollywood producer of a forthcoming United Artists movie, Hackers. He
has a hush-hush involvement in Martin Scorsese's next project, and is
also developing a series of short TV essays which will unite global
movie mega-stars with their less well-kent admirers in the avant garde
arts (''the ideal would be Ian Hamilton-Finlay meets Bruce Willis'').
And he does have one story to tell about his previous video-art
installation, in one of London's more unusual public spaces. ''I set up
a tower of monitors atop one of the lifts in Greenwich Foot Tunnel,
150ft down, playing videos on the shaft walls as the lift went up and
down. It should have been secure, but one night a would-be thief climbed
down and wrecked it. I can't wait to see the footage on the security
video . . .''
* Fear was commissioned by the Fringe Film and Video Festival for
their tenth anniversary exhibition, and can be seen at Edinburgh's
Collective Gallery in Cockburn Street until March 4, alongside video
installations by Alan Currall and Bryndis Snaebjornsdottir.

* DEFENDING champions Barcelona plunged to a humiliating 5-0 defeat on
Saturday against lowly Racing Santander, third from bottom of the
Spanish first division.
Last year's European Cup finalists, missing three key men through
injury and suspension, finished the match with just nine players after
Albert Ferrer and goalkeeper Carlos Busquets were both sent off.
It ended a miserable week for coach Johan Cruyff who saw his side
crash 4-1 at home to Atletico Madrid in the Spanish Cup on Tuesday.

THIRD DIVISION
JIMMY Crease knows a bit about the resurrection business, having been
in charge of Berwick Rangers when they climbed back from near-extinction
to their present respectable status as challengers for a place in the
first division, so he seems singularly well equipped for the job of
steering Albion Rovers from the foot of Scottish football's basement.
Although player-coach Joe McBride picked the team on Saturday, Crease
was able to see what he is up against as the Rovers' new manager. They
lost 2-1 at home to Caledonian Thistle and it was the usual hard-luck
story.
Both keepers were required to make good saves early on, and it was a
mistake by the home side's David McDonald that allowed Norman MacMillan
to open for the Inverness team in 28 minutes. With quarter of an hour to
go, Rovers were awarded a penalty, but Martin Scott missed. Eight
minutes from time McBride did score, his 20-yarder taking a helpful
deflection, but just two minutes later Martin Lisle headed in a Colin
Mitchell free kick and Rovers were left once again to muse on what might
have been.
At least they have tasted victory at home, over Queen's Park, who went
to Gayfield on Saturday wary that they might also provide Arbroath with
a first home win of the season. But, with no goals after 54 minutes the
match was abandoned.
As manager Bill Lamont knows only too well, Alloa have a habit of
giving the opposition not one goal of a start but two. They did it in
the cup-tie against Ross County at Alloa, which they lost 3-2, and they
did it again on Saturday at Dingwall -- and went down 6-0.
Former Aberdeen player Andy McLeod had put County 2-0 up but towards
half-time Alloa gave themselves two self-inflicted wounds. Neil Bennett
and Willie Newbigging were sent off in quick succession, and the nine
men were swamped in the second half. Brian Grant hit a second-half
double, Gordon Connelly found the net, and substitute Alan Duff
completed the rout. County are now only two points behind leaders
Forfar.

THE decision by Tommy Burns to drop team captain Paul McStay for the
premier division match against Hibs on Saturday is a clear sign that the
patience of the quiet-spoken Celtic manager is running out.
Burns refused to go into depth about his decision, but it can be
assumed that the removal of McStay was the first warning to the
established internationalists that he has not been at all satisfied with
their performances this season.
Even in his praise of John Collins' showing against Hibs, the manager
gave a hint that he, too, was due to step up the quality of his work.
''John played well, but we need much more of that from him.''
McStay was still not willing to discuss the matter yesterday. ''I
really would prefer not to say anything until I have digested
everything,'' he told me. But it did not need the deductive powers of Mr
Holmes to work out that he was an angry man at being left out to make
way for one of the bright young things at Parkhead, Brian McLaughlin.
The captain had only just returned to the side at Motherwell last week
after a two-game suspension, when McLaughlin was left out to accommodate
him, and, although he had taken a slight knock, he was fit to play.
''I chose the team I wanted to play for this match,'' said Burns,
''These decisions have to be made but they are between me and the
players.''
Speculation about McStay's future is bound to be a consequence of the
weekend action, but Burns is more likely to have taken the decision to
make the well-paid internationalist aware that much more is expected of
him than has been the case in recent months.
McStay, whose contract runs out at the end of the season, has already
made it clear that he wants to stay with Celtic for the rest of his
career, and Burns also would like that to be the case.
However, by his action, the manager has indicated to his captain that
nothing is written in stone.
He will expect McStay to prove to the Celtic supporters as well as the
management that he is ready to lead the club into the promised new era.
Only Peter Grant, the much criticised, long-serving Parkhead man, has
been a consistent success in the heart of the side, and Burns has been
disappointed that his form has not been matched regularly by the three
internationalists alongside him, McStay, Collins, and Phil O'Donnell.
There are other established men who also can be sure that the quality
of their play has to improve or they, too, will be given the shock
treatment that McStay suffered at the weekend.
He may have a studious, mild appearance but Burns was never anybody's
push-over as a player.
He can bare his teeth with the best of them. Paul McStay will not be
the last of the current squad to find this out.

THE STOREMAN
THE terraced house of Peter and Jean Gildea in East Kilbride is a
tribute to the endeavours of a hard-working couple to provide a decent
life for themselves and their children. It is distinguished from its
neighbours by a smart white porch around a cottage-style door with
leaded glass windows. Inside it is warm and cosy, the lounge furniture
new and comfortable.
When they moved in two years ago, it seemed their future was secure.
The mortgage was well within their budget, as both were employed by
Rolls-Royce, and there was enough left to run a car and take their two
young daughters on regular holidays.
''We were doing fine,'' Peter recalls. ''We bought the house on the
understanding that Rolls-Royce was a reliable employer, and we felt safe
and secure.'' They were soon to be cruelly disillusioned.
The first blow fell a year ago when Jean received an ''at risk''
letter from management. After almost 20 years with the company as a
telephonist and a supervisor, she was informed of impending staff cuts
in the computer department in which she was working. Her services were
no longer required, and she had a week in which to appeal against the
decision. She didn't bother.
''I never went back,'' she says. ''A week later somebody came round
and gave me my redundancy, which was less than a year's wages, and that
was the end of it.''
The first intimation that worse was to come was a radio news bulletin.
It was 7 am on Thursday, January 19. Jean was rousing her elder daughter
for school, and she caught the end of an announcement about redundancies
at Rolls-Royce on her daughter's clock-radio. Her husband's initial
reaction was disbelief. ''It cannae be us,'' he said. ''It must be
Hillington.''
On arriving at the plant, where he has worked for eight years as a
warehouse operator, he found the place in a ferment with groups of
worried men discussing the news. ''Some said it was just a rumour, but
others said they had read it in The Herald. Then I knew it must be
right, it must be East Kilbride, and my heart sank.''
Yet the mood of disbelief persisted. ''The men were still saying it
couldn't be us. We knew the company was going through a lean period, and
we were bending over backwards to help and be flexible -- we'd even
given up a wage rise a couple of years ago. We didn't see what more we
could do.''
Soon, a member of the management came to the warehouse. He stood on a
wooden pallet, surrounded by crates of parts for RB-211 engines, and
read a prepared statement to a fearful gathering of about 100.
''When he started on about rationalisation you could see the faces
dropping,'' Peter recalls. ''When he read out the numbers of
redundancies you could hear the gasps. Two lassies beside me started
crying. Then he just said 'thank you' and walked away.''
It took a few minutes for the horror of the announcement to sink in.
If any confirmation were required, it came in the form of shop stewards
hurrying from a separate briefing from management. ''I knew then that it
was the end,'' Peter says. ''The feeling on the shopfloor was that there
was no tomorrow. That was it.
When Peter got home that night, he told his wife at the door: ''You
were right this morning, Jean. It's us.'' There was no more to be said.
He spent the evening in front of the TV, unaware of what he was
watching. ''I was numb. If I had any feeling, it was that I had been
betrayed; that I had done all I could for the company and now it was
kicking me out. We all felt badly let down.''
After the initial shock, the mood in the warehouses hardened. ''The
anger is there to be seen, but there is also determination to try and
persuade the company they've made the wrong move,'' Peter says.
''There are 108 people on the shopfloor. I know every one, and there's
not an ounce of resignation in any of them. There are enhanced severance
terms on the table, but nobody wants to know. We want to keep our jobs.
We're ready to stand up and keep this factory alive.''
Over the years, RR had instilled a sense of pride and commitment in
its workforce, and ironically it is this very team spirit which has been
roused against the company in a last-ditch fight to avoid the dole.
Peter explains: ''There is strong self-belief at the plant. I'm not
going to slag off Derby, but when it comes to designing and building
aero-engines we're second to none. From the drawing board to the flight
tests, we're the best. It's not just commitment to a job, it's pride in
what we do. If we've got to go out, we'll go out with heads held high.
But hopefully it won't come to that.''
The chances are, of course, that it will; that in a few months more
than 600 men and women will be searching desperately for alternative
employment in an area with little to offer; a little army of people
suddenly anxious about paying mortgages, supporting elderly relatives,
and educating children. The cost in corporate terms of
''rationalisation'' is easily calculated; the cost in human angst far
harder to measure.
For Peter and Jean, it may mean scraping by on her wages for part-time
work testing components at the Motorola factory. After paying the
mortgage, there is barely enough left to feed and clothe the family, and
none for luxuries.''With 600 people hitting the dole, and without a
recognised skill, it's going to be hard for me to get another job,''
says Peter. ''So it's down to the bare essentials for us.''
They have already scrapped plans to take the children to Disneyland in
Florida this year, but amid all the gloom at least Peter retains his
sense of humour. Asked if they would manage a holiday this year, he
replies: ''Aye, if we can find a roofless caravan in Saltcoats.''
But he also has an understanding of the broader issues involved. He
says: ''I think Rolls-Royce is imploding into itself by centralising too
much. It's part of a process of the whole British aerospace industry
selling out, and some day all the engines will be made overseas. It's
the economics of the madhouse. Meantime there are going to be some
families here left with no earned income whatsoever. I don't think they
realise what they've done.
0 ''We want to keep our jobs not just for ourselves, but for East
Kilbide and the youngsters who'll be leaving school in the next few
years. The town's skill factor is being taken away in one fell swoop,
and these jobs are not going to be replaced. We're not making anything
any more. If we don't make anything, how can we survive?''

A COUPLE who both suffer from multiple sclerosis pleaded yesterday for
supplies of the drug Interferon Beta to be made available in Scotland.
Mr Angus Morrison fears that the drug may reach the NHS too late to
enable him to go on caring for his dying wife Catherine.
Mrs Morrison, a former neonatal care nurse at Yorkhill Hospital in
Glasgow, contracted MS 25 years ago; Mr Morrison was diagnosed 10 years
ago as having it.
The early symptoms of exhaustion are now taking their toll on Mr
Morrison as he struggles to nurse his paralysed wife in their cottage on
the shores of Loch Fyne in Argyllshire.
The 54-year-old couple have had their hopes raised by recent
favourable trial results of Interferon Beta, hailed in the British
Medical Journal last week as giving grounds for cautious optimism.
Neither variant of the drug -- 1A or 1B -- is a cure for MS but the
trials indicate that they can slow the progress of the disease, an
auto-immune disorder in which the myelin sheathing is stripped from
round the nerves, leading to scarring and loss of function.
According to an Edinburgh-based charity, the Myelin Project,
Interferon Beta is already being widely prescribed on a named-patient
basis in England.
Ms Diana McGovern, 51, founder of the Myelin Project and an MS
sufferer herself, is one of the few patients in Scotland who has been
able to get regular supplies.
''I have been taking it for eleven months,'' she said. ''It doesn't
turn the clock back so it is difficult to say what difference it has
made -- but it is what we might become that frightens us.
''The data we have seen are very favourable but doctors in Scotland
seem to be more cautious about giving it to individual patients before
it is approved for general use.''
One of the makers, Schering Health Care, hopes to have approval from
the European Licensing Authorities for their product -- Interferon Beta
1B -- around the summer of this year.
However, Mr Morrison, who used to work at the ARMS Hyperbaric
Treatment Centre for MS patients in Maryhill, Glasgow, until the disease
forced him to quit, is afraid time is running out for himself and
Catherine. He said: ''It would be a dream if the drug could be obtained
on the NHS but it seems to be an impossibility in Scotland.
''Catherine can't move her arms or legs, and her sight is very poor.
She is so dependent on me. We get nursing help three mornings a week
but, apart from that, I do everything.
''I am starting to get weakness in my left leg and left arm . . . for
a while I could not sign a cheque. Now I have to watch when I lift a
plate in case I dropped it.''
The Morrisons' cottage has been fitted out to make it as easy as
possible for him to lift Catherine about. She has a Possum computer
which enables her to open doors, switch lights on and off, and look
after the house for long enough to let Angus pop out for the messages.
He is proud of the fact that, after nine years' quadraplegia, she has
no bedsores -- and he wonders how long this can last if nothing can be
done to slow the progress of his own disease.

STARTING today, a selection of buy, sell and hold share
recommendations from leading stockbrokers will be published weekly.
Scottish stockbrokers cater extensively for the private investor, as
do a number of firms south of the Border. But stock market analysts at
the larger securities houses in the City address a wider, mostly
institutional shareholder clientele.
Their recommendations on individual shares are nonetheless valuable to
private investors, who are unlikely to have ready access to them.
Analysts have the resources to investigate industries and particular
companies in depth.
Each analyst usually specialises in a particular sector and gets to
know it in detail. He often visits the companies in his sector and is in
a strong position to assess prospects in the long and short term --
though, of course, he does not always get it right.
The aim of this column is to provide a good cross-section of analysts'
views from City as well as Scottish stockbrokers.
The opinions expressed are those of the stockbrokers making the
recommendations, with which the Herald does not necessarily agree.
British
Telecom
BUY at 399p (now 393p), recommends Goldman Sachs, which picks it as
one of five UK stocks in its European priority list. One of the least
expensive telecommunications companies in the world on a relative and
absolute basis. BT's March 1996 estimated price earning ratio of 12.2 is
at a slight discount to the UK market, compared with a market multiple
for most other telecom companies showing a slight premium relative to
their home markets. Underlying operating results continue to benefit
from improving economic conditions in the UK as well as the company's
increasingly competitive actions. BT is well-positioned to take
advantage of opportunities associated with the liberalisation of the
European telecom industry.
Tarmac
A RECOVERY buy at 115p, suggests Albert E Sharp. One of the UK's
largest housebuilders, Tarmac fell twice as fast as a lacklustre
building materials sector during 1994. January saw it fall further to a
two-year low of 107p but has since rallied as investors began to
appreciate the solid value increasingly apparent in the shares.
Short-term sentiment on housing is likely to continue to be adverse
through much of the first quarter. But, thereafter, housing activity,
and therefore sentiment, should progressively improve and with it the
Tarmac share price.
TDG
A FUNDAMENTAL reassessment is due after 25 years of underperformance
which has seen the distribution, transport and storage company's shares
fall in value by two-thirds relative to the market, says BZW. The
reconstruction of the business is now effectively complete and the task
now is to produce the right sort of returns. Profits are forecast to
improve this year from #26.9m to #34.5m and the yield at 200p on the
likely maintained dividend is 5.9%.
Sidlaw
THE brave will buy for income only at 158p (now 146p). Significant
capital gain may be some way off, says Bell Lawrie White. The annual
statement was a major disappointment and the particular comment that
''the packaging division's first-half performance will be significantly
below that reported for the same period last year'' indicates the extent
of the hole which Sidlaw has dug for itself. In packaging, Sidlaw has
not the brand names, market shares or customer relationships enjoyed by
others, so margins are suffering.
The broker is reducing its full-year pre-tax profit estimate from
#17.8m to #14m as well as there being a probable #1.5m exceptional loss.
However, the dividend could be raised 0.2p to 11.2p for a 9.6% yield.
Kingfisher
ATTENTION continues to be focused on Kingfisher, the retail chain
whose trading formats include B&amp;Q and the troubled Comet electricals
chain following the recent abrupt departure of chief executive Alan
Smith and finance director James Kerr-Muir.
Stockbroker BZW recommends holding the shares on the basis that the
longer fundamental underperformance continues the more vulnerable the
group will become. Accordingly, one should expect Kingfisher to be
valued increasingly in line with its underlying break-up value. BZW
estimates this to range from #4.70 to #6.00 per share. This compares
with Kingfisher's price in the market of 433p.
BSkyB
GOLDMAN Sachs, the US securities house, likes the look of British Sky
Broadcasting (BSkyB). It is the leading Pay-TV broadcasting service in
the UK with over 2.9 million satellite subscribers and close to one
million cable TV subscribers. Last week, the company pleased the City
with interim results showing a 48% increase in turnover to #356.9m.
The Goldman media analyst has a price target of 310p within nine
months, ie a rise of over 10%. The company is thought to be in a very
strong position for the future, with its long-term programme contracts,
encryption technology and subscriber management centre. BSKyB shares are
currently around 268p.
British
Airways
BRITISH Airways shares are set to climb higher from the current 384p,
according to Nikko Europe, though some turbulence may be encountered
until the situation at USAir, the American airline in which BA has
invested $400m, is formally clarified. Nikko says the benefits of the
alliance, amounting to some $100m, should continue even if USAir falls
into the Chapter 11 procedure which gives companies protection against
creditors. In the first nine months of 1994-95, BA's passenger traffic
rose by 7% against a 5% increase in capacity, resulting in an
improvement in load factor from 71% to 72.4%. Passenger yields dipped
0.2% but unit costs rose only 0.4%, which impressed Nikko's analyst.
Reckitt
&amp; Colman
RECKITT &amp; Colman wins a buy accolade from BZW, which believes the
shares will soon outperform as the market anticipates accelerating
earnings growth in 1996. Similar shares in the US have recently enjoyed
a substantial re-rating and Reckitt is expected to follow suit as
investment interest shifts increasingly towards consumer stocks. The
shares, currently 646p, already up 41p since the recommendation was
issued, have underperformed the market by 31% in the past three years,
leaving them on an historically depressed rating. BZW sees Reckitt's
markets becoming easier and profits benefiting from a new focused
strategy. Dividend growth should approach 10% a year between 1994 and
1997, with earnings forecast to rise 15% in 1996 and 13% in 1997.

Celtic 2, Hibernian 2
CELTIC'S Dutch striker, Pierre van Hooydonk, demonstrated at the
weekend that he can manoeuvre just as smartly off the field as he does
on it.
Producing a neat reverse turn, he brought a new dimension to
after-match chat when he interviewed the press. The troops were a bit
taken aback. Pierre, WE ask the questions.
The Dutchman, like most of his countrymen, is a deep thinker about the
game and was concerned to discover if Celtic had changed in the time
since he joined the club. ''You saw them before I came. Is it any
better?'' The answer has to be in the affirmative, but no-one gave him
the impression his new team had reached a new plane yet.
The tall man who played for Breda is clearly anxious to make an
impression, but is even more interested in seeing the Parkhead team
establishing a style that suits his own way of playing. For van
Hooydonk, the problem his height presents is a presumption that he is an
aerial player, a kind of Dutch Mark Hateley.
''Do you see a difference in the way we are playing now?'' he asked.
''I thought we played the best football since I came here. At first the
team sent long balls into me, but my best quality is on the ground. I
think now we are playing more one-twos, more football.''
Van Hooydonk, brought up to play the thinking man's game in the Dutch
style, was frustrated in the second half when his team, leading 2-1,
continued to push for a third goal.
''In Holland, if we are 2-1 up we keep the ball, we go backward if
there is no-one to play the ball ahead to, but Celtic go forward, and
then go forward again and again. All it needs a is a half chance and it
is 2-2, which is what happened.
''I like to play the Dutch way, but maybe I need to change my ways.
The only right way is the winning way.''
Hooydonk has a soul-mate in John Collins, who plays the game as he
likes it and thinks on the same wavelength, but the Dutchman is also
impressed by the young players coming into the big team.
His own ambitions lie in getting Celtic into Europe. ''I could have
played 100 years with Breda and not played in Europe. With Celtic I hope
to get there soon. We still have chances this season, in the Scottish
Cup and the league.''
Hooydonk, having held his own chat show with the pencil brigade, then
held court with a gaudily bedecked group of Breda fans who had made the
journey to see their old favourite in action. He had a busy day.
His contribution on the field was considerable in a game which was
dominated by a man who has been around the Scottish scene a great deal
longer. Jim Leighton, the Hibs goalie, pulled of a handful of wonderful
saves, but nothing he did was better than the attempt at halting
Collins' opening goal.
Hooydonk had taken a tremendous pass from Peter Grant and then laid on
a perfect ball for Collins, who hit it firmly and accurately for the
net. Leighton's diving touch deserved a better fate than the ball going
in off the post.
Collins had his best game for some time, but the outstanding Celtic
man yet again was defender Brian O'Neil, even if he and Mark McNally
found young Kevin Harper's incisive pace difficult to contain at times.
The 18-year-old might well have had a memorable day if he had
converted two golden opportunities but, while manager Alex Miller was
disappointed at those misses, he made the reasonable point that the
teenager was bound to make this kind of error as he goes through the
learning process. ''I think the main point about him is that he did not
look out of place and caused Celtic plenty of problems.''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns, who brought in Brian McLaughlin in
preference to team captain Paul McStay, was full of praise for the
Parkhead fans. ''I thought the supporters showed patience when they saw
the team trying to play football.''
If any player had a special point to make it was Hibs' Pat McGinlay,
who was transferred back to Hibs by Burns. The midfield man got his
message across with a fine day's work, including a well-taken goal that
levelled the scores after Collins' opener.
Willie Falconer did the next trick for Celtic, when he headed in the
second goal from a Collins cross, but the man who got most enjoyment out
of scoring had yet to make his appearance.
Mark McGraw, who replaced Joe Tortolano, scored a goal that meant much
more to him than any of the others, however satisfying it might have
been for them. The son of Morton manager Allan, McGraw was scoring only
his second goal of the season and needed it to further his claim for a
first-team place.
''The club has the best set of strikers on the staff since I came here
and it makes it very comeptitive. I am just glad to get a chance,'' he
said. ''It is important that I take any goal opportunities that come my
way.''
His previous goal, against Partick Thistle, also came when he was a
substitute. ''I had one touch before I scored that day, this time I had
two, and gave the ball away each time.''
McGraw's contract ends this summer and he knows he has to make the
most of any opportunities either to be given a new one or to attract
interest from elsewhere.

EXPRO International Group, a leading independent supplier of oilfield
services, is to be floated this spring with an expected market
capitalisation of over #100m.
The company, which in July 1992 was the subject of a #52m management
buyout from Flextech, was originally formed in 1973 with venture capital
backing and established operating bases in Great Yarmouth, to service
the gas fields in the southern North Sea, and in Aberdeen to provide
services to the North Sea oilfields.
In the North Sea, the group has built strong positions in a number of
its niche markets and has expanded its franchise into other oil and gas
producing areas in Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa, South
America, the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, certain of which
have only recently become accessible to Western operators and service
companies.
The board, led by group chief executive John Dawson, now want to raise
finance to reduce debt and fund expansion.
For the nine months to end December 1994, 47% of turnover was derived
from the UK continental shelf with the remaining 53% coming from
overseas markets.
Around two thirds of revenues currently come from the development and
production phases of the upstream oil and gas industry which provide a
more stable and long term source of revenues than exploration and
appraisal activities. Some 20% of the group's turnover is at present
related to gas exploration and production.
Group products and services are provided to most of the major Western
oil companies.
Since the buyout, which was backed by CINVen, profits have risen from
#7.8m in 1992/93 to #10.4m on turnover of #65.4m in 1993/94. Further
''significant growth'' in profits is forecast for the current financial
year. The flotation will be sponsored by Robert Fleming &amp; Company and
Cazenove &amp; Co will be brokers to the issue.

EUROTUNNEL is still targeting a half share of the cross-channel car
market despite a new report which considers claims that it could reach
only a quarter and face ''commercial collapse.''
The report, from a study group including Kent County Council, ferry
companies and Eurotunnel itself, is based on work by consultants MDS
Transmodal.
The report suggests that ''using objective assumptions'', the
consultants' projections are ''much less optimistic about the prospects
for the tunnel''.
The report considers various assumptions about future tunnel market
share, from Eurotunnel's 50% to 35% or even 25% suggested by ferry
companies, which would imply ''the commercial collapse of Eurotunnel''.
But Eurotunnel spokesman John Noulton said: ''We would hardly be
producing a report which forecasts our possible collapse. This document
is not a forecast of cross-channel traffic share.
''It recognises that the cross-channel market share of the Kent ports
including Eurotunnel is growing rapidly and will continue to grow. It
produces a strategy designed to help achieve that.''
The report called for better infrastructure -- including the planned
high-speed rail line and new road links -- and backed this with
projections based on conflicting assumptions supplied by the rival
operators, he said.
''Eurotunnel happily signed up to this report which certainly does not
forecast that we will achieve 25% or 35% of the market. Our own forecast
remains that we will achieve 50% of the car market.
This was in addition to predicting that it would make ''a substantial
hole'' in the freight market -- and did not take account of through
passengers travelling by Eurostar trains, said Mr Noulton.
A spokesman for P&amp;O European Ferries confirmed the projections were
supplied by the operators. It had long held the view that the tunnel
would reach 35% of the market.

SCOTLAND reported no casualties from their squad session at
Murrayfield yesterday as the squad prepared for the Five Nations' trip
to Paris on Saturday, where they will endeavour to log their first away
win over France since 1969.
The London Scottish replacement prop Paul Burnell did not attend the
session as he is suffering from tonsillitis but, say the management, he
is expected to be fit and well by the weekend.
According to an SRU spokesman, there were no further adverse reports
on captain Gavin Hastings (back) who played no part in Watsonians'
league win over Heriot's FP on Saturday or Stirling County winger Ken
Logan (ankle) who was absent from his side's outing against
Stewart's-Melville FP.

DAVID Sole, Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam captain, declared yesterday
that if the weekend revelations that French clubs are paying win bonuses
to their players proved to be correct then, logically, the Scots should
refuse to play France in Paris on Saturday.
Sole, who raised the issue of professionalism within the French game
three years ago in his autobiography, said that Saturday's international
would, of course, go ahead but he hoped that the authorities would now
look seriously at worldwide abuses of the amateurism regulations.
The apparent admission by the president of the French rugby champions
Toulouse that their players are paid bonuses for a win comes in a BBC
Scotland documentary to be screened later this week.
The revelation, and the associated suspicion that the practice is
widespread throughout the French game, could not have come at a more
inopportune time for Scotland during the week of the Paris match and for
the International Board which is in the final stages of its own
investigation into professionalism.
Toulouse president Rene Bouscatel makes the cash revelations in a BBC
Scotland ''Frontline'' documentary -- For Love and Money? -- to be
screened on Thursday night.
Bouscatel is understood to say: ''Here we have a fixed monthly amount
which covers all the time the players lose through rugby training and
loss of earnings.''
He apparently adds: ''There is also a match bonus based on results.
That is a reward if they win, for what they've brought to the club and
for the pleasure they've brought to the sponsors and spectators. No one
here earns more than 110 francs a year. (#13,750)''
The admission by Bouscatel, if correct, is in direct and blatant
contravention of International Board regulations, which state: ''The
game is an amateur game. No person is allowed directly or indirectly to
receive payment, benefit or other material reward ... for taking part in
the game.''
It has been suspected for many years that the highly competitive and
heavily sponsored French club game is bolstered by player payments.
Between 1932 and the end of World War II, Scotland broke off playing
relations with France over financial irregularities.
The Scots are due to travel to Paris on Saturday for their Five
Nations' encounter with France, who include two Stade Toulousain players
in the side to meet Scotland.
In his autobiography -- ''Heart and Sole'' -- David Sole maintained
that the system of payments in France was borrowed directly from rugby
league, where players are on substantial win bonuses. He argued for a
''level playing field'' throughout the world so that all international
players were placed on the same financial footing.
Yesterday he said: ''It's been common knowledge among players that
this has been going on for years. The authorities, though, have chosen
to adopt an ostrich-like attitude with their heads in the sand.
''What is surprising is that here we, apparently, have a French
official coming out into the open and admitting the practice. The
logical effect of this would be that Scotland would refuse to play
France but that won't happen. Perehaps now, though, the blatant
shamateurism that goes on all around the world will be addressed,'' said
Sole who now manages Scotland's under-19 side.
Yesterday, Scotland's two IB representatives, Freddie McLeod and Alan
Hosie, were attending a meeting in London and were unavailable for
comment.
An IB investigation into professionalism within the game worldwide is
due to be presented to the board agm in Bristol next month. The inquiry
team, headed by board chairman Vernon Pugh QC of Wales, and comprising
Freddie McLeod, Rob Fisher of New Zealand, and Bernard Lapasset of
France has, as reported in The Herald a fortnight ago, already
undercovered widespread abuses of the game's amateurism regulations.

Moscow, Sunday
REBEL Chechnya said today its forces killed 250 Russian troops by
blowing up a booby-trapped missile site as they stepped up hit-and-run
attacks in flashpoints outside the capital Grozny.
Chechen Information Minister Movladi Udugov told Ekho Moskvy radio
station the Russians were killed when withdrawing Chechen forces blew up
the mined former Soviet missile launching site near the town of
Alkhan-Kala, southwest of Grozny.
Udugov said 24 Russian armoured vehicles had also been destroyed at
the site.
''The entire compound was blown up -- it had been mined . . . All the
equipment and soldiers who entered the compound were completely
destroyed by fire,'' he told Ekho Moskvy.
The report could not be confirmed, but lightly-armed Chechens have
inflicted heavy casualties on Russian troops who have been humiliated at
many stages in eight weeks of fighting.
Reuters television pictures shot this week at a military morgue in the
city of Rostov-on-Don showed numerous corpses recovered from
battlefields, some naked and decomposing on stretchers, others in red
coffins bearing the Russian flag.
Udugov reported a sniper war in central Grozny and fighting around the
key southern junction at Minutka Square, belying Russian claims that
fighting had eased over the weekend.
The Russian government's press office said there had been no active
military operations in the remote mountainous region yesterday or today
and that Russians controlled most of Grozny.
But Udugov reported Russian air raids and artillery shelling on the
towns of Alkhan-Yurt and Alkhan-Kala, a few miles out of Grozny on the
main road southwest.
He said battles were fought today at Argun, a town nine miles east of
Grozny which media reports have suggested is the new rebel headquarters.
The Chechen minister said Russian forces were trying to break through
Chechen defences outside Gudermes, Chechnya's second biggest city about
25 miles east of Grozny.--Reuter.

IF artistic director Andrew McKinnon had been looking for an
illustration of why he feels he must leave Perth, he could hardly do
better than this production. Of course the timing of the announcement of
his departure in the week before this play opened was coincidental.
Equally, he programmed it and directs it, so the blame is his.
The programme says it all. Dinner and Morum's The Late Edwina Black is
described as a ''descendant'' of Patrick Hamilton's Gaslight with
''staying power.'' Not, you'll notice, a piece of Victoriana that has
something pertinent to say to us today. It was feasible to work out the
entire plot from the title and the cast of (four) characters before the
curtain rose -- and whodunnit 10 minutes in.
The set (''co-ordinated'' by Louise Saunders, which suggests to me
that Perth regulars may have recognised bits of it) is substantially
built. The characters are cardboard and the script paper thin, but full
of superfluities like ''But who?'', and ''She's gone -- she can't harm
us anymore.'' This might be the sort of stuff the Perth board thinks its
audience likes, but at least one line -- ''I've hurt you, haven't I'' --
reduced the Circle to giggles on the first night.
The cast don't so much struggle with this stuff as roll over and die.
Kay Gallie's West Country accent would be funnier if it wasn't totally
upstaged by Kenneth Bryans Scots policeman veering hilariously from the
Western Isles to Dundee. Andrew Normington as the grief-free widower
throws inappropriately Cowardesque shapes, and Carol Brannan manages to
keep a straight face as Lisa, the late Edwina's companion and his lover.

THERE are some moments -- just a few, and they are to be savoured --
when the Royal SNO plays like no other orchestra in the world.
Usually those moments are in Russian music, and they usually occur
when the band is with a good East European conductor.
It's nothing to do with polish, ensemble, virtuosity, or any of the
characteristics with which one normally associates high-quality
orchestral playing. It's as though something elemental is unleashed in
the collective psyche of the orchestra. It's awesome when it happens, as
it did on Saturday night when principal guest conductor Alexander
Lazarev directed a performance of Prokofiev's Third Symphony that was
almost primal in its ferocity.
The key to what happens is that such a conductor gives the band its
head -- did those winds ever shriek more chillingly, the brass blaze
more aggressively? And in interpretation of the symphony, Lazarev seized
on the fact that at key points Prokofiev hurls diametrically opposing
types of music together -- broad, searing melodies and the driving,
machine-like rhythms of the factory.
Slamming the two together almost causes a short-circuit in the brain.
The effect was astonishing; mind-numbing, edge-of-the-seat stuff, with
the SNO playing out of its skin, tearing apart the piece like a
voracious predator with a hunk of raw meat between its jaws.
The first half of the concert was another extreme -- sheer
sophistication in Gounod's ballet music from Faust, and the inimitably
suave, highly polished oboe playing of Douglas Boyd in a mellow and
immaculately phrased account of Richard Strauss's autumnal Oboe
Concerto. Good turnout.

HOW ironic that the first production to open at the Brunton Theatre
after the announcement of the Scottish Arts Council's grant withdrawal
for the next financial year should not only be a new play -- the SAC
professes to encourage the work of contemporary playwrights -- but also
one with a cast of 10. With a company that size it wouldn't have taken
too extravagant a director to blow the current year's #53,000 grant on
this one show alone.
Perhaps it's coincidence, but there also seems to be an air of bolshie
defiance about Robin Peoples' production of this historical drama by
Raymond Ross. With a recurring clatter of drums and an invariable dark
and gloomy lighting plan, the play seethes and rages like a mean and
moody caged beast that won't be told to lie down.
Despite the rigours of a dense and demanding script, the actors are
uniformly unshakable, blasting out Ross's old Scots language with
relentless vigour on a stripped back Shakespearean stage.
Why then does it add up to such a tedious evening? It's partly that
with so much anger ladled out from start to finish it's very difficult
to focus on the finer points of the plot which is all about the
political machinations and institutionalised misogyny that allowed James
VI to introduce witch hunts to Scotland.
There's also not a sympathetic character in it -- James VI himself is
sickly, ineffectual and, like everyone else, bad tempered -- and so many
scenes of wordy negotiations quickly become wearing, especially when you
get the sense that the real action is happening elsewhere. Some humour
would be nice, but anything to alleviate the overbearing tone of
disgruntlement would be welcome.

Johannesburg, Sunday
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela failed today to persuade 11 ANC
members not to resign from the executive of the party's Women's League
headed by his estranged wife Winnie.
He stepped in to try to resolve the controversy, holding four hours of
talks with the 11 women who announced their decision to quit yesterday,
citing bad leadership, undemocratic practices and unaccountability in
the organisation.
''We will not change our minds about the resignations,'' said Nosiviwe
Mpisa-Nqakula who had been secretary-general of the African National
Congress Women's League (ANCWL).
''We want the ANC to resolve the problems of the Women's League,'' she
told a news conference after meeting President Mandela.
The president said: ''This is a matter that is entirely in the hands
of the women's league. They are in firm control.'' He declined further
comment.
Mpisa-Nqakula said the president had promised to arrange a meeting of
the Women's League executive, which had 25 members before yesterday's
resignations, and the ANC proper.
''He is seriously considering to put structures in place to finally
resolve the problems in the ANC Women's League. We have finally got the
African National Congress to intervene in the problems,'' she added.
Also in the 11-strong group were Adelaide Tambo, widow of ANC
president Oliver Tambo who died in 1993, and South African Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma.
The meeting came after reports of a new controversy over Mrs Mandela's
criticism of her husband's government.
Johannesburg's Sunday Times said South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki had given her an ultimatum on Friday to retract critical
statements or resign as deputy minister of arts and culture.
She had criticised the government at a funeral last week, saying it
had failed South Africans by not dealing with apartheid imbalances and
removing racism.
President Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, was unable to comment
on the reports of an ultimatum.
''He was unhappy about certain remarks. The deputy president and the
president are dealing with the matter. They will probably issue a
statement early next week,'' Mankahlana said.
President Mandela had summoned all ANC cabinet ministers and deputy
ministers to Pretoria last Thursday to discuss Mrs Mandela's comments,
the Sunday Times said.
None of the 11 disaffected ANCWL leaders identified Mrs Mandela among
their reasons for leaving.
Tambo said that she had resigned over a joint tourism venture between
the league and actor Omar Sharif, launched last Thursday by Mrs Mandela
without consulting the organisation.
Mrs Mandela was unavailable for comment today.
The league has considerable influence in the ANC, which swept to power
in all-race elections in April last year.
Mrs Mandela was elected ANCWL president in May 1993 in a dramatic
comeback after she resigned all political posts when she was sentenced
to five years' jail in 1991 on kidnapping charges. On appeal, her
sentence was reduced to a fine of 15,000 rand (#2700).
Until her trial many had considered her the ''mother of the nation''
while her husband served 27 years in prison.
Last week the Canadian government refused her an entry visa because of
her criminal background.--Reuter.

ARE you thinking of setting up in business? Or do you perhaps already
have a small business and need advice about expansion or development?
Trying to get advice and information about the different types and
sources of assistance available can be time consuming and frustrating.
Tomorrow sees the start of a series of enterprise roadshows in Glasgow
bringing together a wide range of different organisations which can help
existing businesses and business start ups. The roadshows give visitors
the opportunity to see for themselves what is on offer from the various
agencies in an informal exhibition-style atmosphere. Admission and all
advice at the roadshows is free.
There is no pressure put on visitors by the participating agencies.
They can browse around and pick up leaflets. They can stop to talk with
representatives of the agencies taking part and can arrange follow-up
meetings with them. No agreements are reached nor obligations incurred
at the roadshows themselves.
This is the eleventh series of enterprise roadshows organised by
Glasgow Opportunities on behalf of the participating agencies. GO is the
local enterprise trust for Glasgow. Jean Baillie, GO's manager of
business training services, said: ''This is the one time in the year
that all the major business advisory agencies are brought together in
one place, and so it is a unique opportunity for anyone considering
self-employment or developing their business.
''It's certainly much easier than having to ring round different
agencies for information and then having to make appointments to see
them. Here they are all together in one place so that people can get an
overall picture of what assistance might be available and from where.
The local enterprise initiative will also be there to advise people
about the opportunities and assistance available in specific areas of
Glasgow.
''For many people the roadshow is their first point of contact with
these agencies. For others it is the opportunity to see them all in one
day which otherwise might take weeks or even months to get round.
Everyone who attends is taken seriously and often follow-up appointments
are made.''
The roadshows will be of interest both to start ups and existing
businesses. Ms Baillie said: ''It does not matter how far or how little
advanced the business idea is. Some people may not even have a firm feel
yet of what they want to do. Others may have very definite plans but
need advice on their commercial feasibility or how to present them or
get financial assistance. They will all get something out of the
roadshows.''
The range of organisations taking part means that advice and
information is available to visitors about finance for start up or
expansion, training either for themselves or for their staff, finding
new or additional premises, marketing, taking on staff, and indeed on
any matter likely to be important to people setting up in or developing
a business.
Attendance at the enterprise roadshows has been rising over the years.
Last year about 500 were expected but in fact there were about 700
visitors. This year's turnout is expected to well exceed last year.
Visitors come from all age groups and backgrounds. Some are young people
who see self employment as an opportunity to develop skills and
experience for future career prospects. Some are in jobs which have
given them skills they feel they could use to set up in a business of
their own.
Others are people who have been made redundant but who have skills and
experience they can use to set up a successful business, and some are
women who have taken time off paid work because of family commitments
and who feel their skills and expertise could best be used in self
employment. Many, whatever their current work circumstances visit the
enterprise roadshows because they are committed to a business idea which
they are sure could succeed. A growing number are people who own or run
existing businesses but need advice about expansion or development. All
are welcome.
Tomorrow's enterprise roadshow is being held in the Ingram Hotel, from
noon until 8pm and the following day in the Swallow Hotel from 5pm until
9pm. Next week there will be a further three roadshows, on Monday at
Partick Thistle, on Tuesday at the Grosvenor Hotel and on Wednesday at
Celtic Park.

THE value of the enterprise roadshows is the range of agencies taking
part so that visitors can tap into the services they offer according to
their own personal business needs.
This year for the first time the Industry Department of the Scottish
Office has come on board, further broadening and strengthening the range
of advice and assistance on offer.
Located in Glasgow and Edinburgh it advises the Scottish Secretary of
State on industrial and economic development in Scotland. Its Glasgow
office is responsible for administering a range of Government and
European Community funded programmes, financial assistance schemes and
expert advice designed to stimulate business growth.
The Scottish Business Shop is also taking part. In partnership with
over 100 public organisations including local enterprise companies,
local authorities, chambers of commerce, local enterprise agencies and
development companies, the Scottish Business Shop network provides
independent and confidential advice on all areas for business start up
and development. Quality and consistency of the network's services are
overseen by Enterprise Services Scotland, a subsidiary of Scottish
Enterprise.
Strathclyde Business Development can provide grants for taking on
unemployed people or for training young people. There are also grants
for training in management and new technology and for unemployed people
starting up in business, with special grant provision for unemployed
women.
Loans of up to 50% can be available in some circumstances. Help can
also be given in seed capital funding. It has a comprehensive database
of industrial and commercial property available within the region and
can advise on current property market rates. It holds databases on
business opportunities and business information and can advise on a wide
range of business services.
Also taking part is the Glasgow Development Agency which can provide
specialist assistance in trade and export development, investment, the
Investors in People award BS5750, technology and design, and company
developments. The agency invests substantially in enterprise trusts and
local area initiatives which provide the main support and advisory
centres for people setting up in business and for small businesses in
their formative years. Glasgow North, East End Partnership, Greater
Easterhouse Development Agency and Govan Initiative are all taking part
in the roadshow.
The business development office of Glasgow City Council Industrial
Development Unit provides a free service for local businesses and
business start ups including advice on marketing, selling, production
control, financial management and business plans for retailing,
wholesaling and manufacturing. The unit operates a number of small
funding schemes.
The Scottish Co-operative Development Company was set up to help
worker co-operatives and other types of employee owned business start
ups and also to provide them with ongoing assistance afterwards. This
includes training in business practices, help in developing business
ideas and business plans, help in registering the company and an
aftercare service covering all aspects of business, training and
development.

THE city of Dundee, on the estuary of the River Tay, has had a history
as tumultuous as the giant swells that sweep up the narrow channel from
the North Sea. It went from being one of the most prosperous medieval
burghs to the most industrialised city of nineteenth-century Scotland.
One of the newest attractions in Dundee is Discovery Point, next to
Discovery herself, the first ship designed for research and development
and built in Dundee. At one time Dundee was second only to the Clyde for
shipbuilding.
Clustered around Dundee are the Tay Country Parks, of Clatto and,
further out, Crombie and Monike. They have extensive play facilities for
children and plenty of wide open spaces for quiet enjoyment.
Traces of all Scotland's history can be found in the other great city
of the Tay, Perth. Watergate was once the home of the nobility of
medieval Perth, and North Inch was scene of the Battle of the Clans in
the thirteenth century. The Inch is skirted by the lovely Georgian Rose
Terrace.
Perth Civic trust has helped to ensure that modern Perth is a good
place in which to live. There is an attractive pedestrianised shopping
centre and walkways by the side of the river. The North and South
Inches, public playgrounds are ablaze with flowers in spring and summer.
Boating, boules, football and cricket are activities you can enjoy.
Famous castles can be a bit daunting, but Scone Palace where once the
kings of Scotland were crowned is different. It is crammed full of
interest while being easy to appreciate. European seventeenth-century
carved ivories are treasures among a notable collection of furniture and
china.
If the thought of all these activities tires you, take a stroll in a
gentle place, Bell's Cherrybank Gardens, where there are more than 700
species of heather in the National Heather Collection.
From Perth take the A9 road to Inverness. There seems to be a beauty
spot around every corner.
The road, however, has a bad reputation and try to avoid rush hours
and watch the frequent changes from single to dual carriageway.
Turn right at Dunkeld, the start of Highland Perthshire. The
cathedral, begun in l570 was destroyed during the Reformation, but the
former choir has been restored for use as the Parish Church. The Chapter
House museum houses a history of the church in Dunkeld. A woodland walks
goes to the Tay and Telford's Bridge.
Connected to Dunkeld by the bridge is Birnam, home of the Beatrix
Potter garden, based loosely on her works. As a child she spent summer
holidays in this area.
You may like to rejoin the A9 briefly before the A822 to Crieff and
Comrie. Stop at the beguiling hamlet of Amulree with its unusually
designed church housing an exhibition of the history of the area
including emigration to Canada.
Crieff has Scotland's oldest distillery, going back to at least 1775.
Guided tours take place throughout the day. Nearby is Stuart Crystal,
where you can watch the intricate art of glass engraving.
Further along the A9 is The Hermitage, 37 acres of mixed woodland cut
by the River Braan and its waterfalls. Red squirrels, grey wagtails and
other creatures are commonly seen. It is interesting at all times of the
year but has a magical appeal in the winter with snow on the trees.
The Tay river system, with its host of tributaries, is vast. The river
is the most powerful in Britain, with a flow greater than that of the
Thames and Severn combined. Together they make a region of rivers, and
provide sights of enormous power and beauty. The downside of this water
paradise is serious flooding, known to the people of Perthshire for
centuries.
Few sights delight visitors more than waterfalls great or small and
there are plenty of both. The Falls of Moness in the Birks of Aberfedly
are attractive enough to make the circular walk of 1[1/2] miles
worthwhile. Seats and viewpoints help you get your breath. The Birks
still have pockets of original wildwood, though the extensive
deforestation of the early eighteenth century led Samuel Johnson to
remark that ''a tree in Scotland is as rare as a horse in Venice''. By
the turn of the century landowners were planting again and the Birks are
now a rich and highly valued woodland habitat.
The higher of the Falls of Acharn, reached by a path on the south side
of Loch Tay is surrounded by a wooden walkway. The mountains and fast
flowing rivers and streams that give Scotland much of its natural
attraction also give it hydro electricity. The dams and reservoirs are
constructed and screened to cause as little interference with the
environment.
One of the best known is Pitlochry Dam and Visitor Centre. There are
explanations of how electricity is produced and a viewing chamber to
watch the salmon moving along the fish ladder, constructed to help them
reach their spawning grounds. The Garry-Tummel scheme in particular has
many pleasant walks, including one around the man-made Loch Faskally.
Loch Tay, a loch of many woods, is probably at its most impressive
with snow on the peaks of Ben Lawers nearby. The crannogs of Loch Tay,
islands in the loch which supported human life in prehistoric times have
been investigated, and a replica crannog will be on display this year,
with a more detailed exhibition to follow later. Ben Lawers,
Perthshire's highest mountain has a visitor centre, nature trail and a
stiff walk to the summit. It is noted for alpine flowers.
Pitlochry, a holiday town since Victorian times, is at the centre of a
network of interesting places to visit. Go north to Blair Castle, the
home of the only private army in Britain allowed to bear arms, the
Atholl Highlanders.
From Loch Rannoch and Rannoch Station take a train ride to Fort
William, through beautiful Highland scenery.
At Aberfeldy there is a footbridge over the Tay made of glass and
fibre reinforced plastic, the first of its kind in the world. The water
from The Birks is harnessed for the Aberfedly Water Mill, where you can
buy stone ground flour.
If you travel over Moulin Moor you will come to Moulin itself with its
church that is well over 1000 years old. Carry on to Blairgowrie and
follow the story of heraldry through the ages at the Keathbank Mill and
Heraldry Centre.
A few hundred years ago the people of Glenshee were afraid to travel
over the Cairnwell Pass alone. They were terrorised by Catarnas,
Highland outlaws from the West, with a penchant for murder and cattle
stealing. Now the journey is made routinely by skiers to ''Ski
Glenshee'' on slopes organised for beginners and experts. If skiing is
not to your liking, go straight on to Braemar and Royal Deeside.
The Tay is, of course, a major salmon river, and first-class fishing
for salmon and trout, and coarse fishing, is easy to find. A pamphlet,
once again available from tourist offices, gives advice and vital
information on regulations.
Hotels, and agents for the estates, will be able to put you in the
picture for game shooting and stalking.
Whether you seek peace, relaxation, interesting places to visit or
strenuous physical activity, you will find them all in the Land of the
Tay.

BIG Hamish is pleased. He's got tatties and they're selling for
anything up to 10 times what he's had to settle for in recent years. And
what about the straw? Don't tell Hamish farming is coming to a bad patch
as long as straw is through the roof.
You'll remember the sale he had at the back of harvest time? He had
several thousand bales for sale at his estate by the coast. Now, I've
been going to roups for a long time and I thought I always knew what was
going on.
I knew Hamish was having a hard time selling his straw but I thought
he was working away at about #5 a bale. I thought I had got one of the
few bargains when I got 100 bales of rape straw for #150.
But that was far from the truth. In fact, mine was the only bargain.
None of the rest of the straw was sold except to seagulls. I was
suspicious when the local lollipop man had 100 bails of barley straw
knocked down to him. I knew he had five rows of strawberries but that
did seem too much.
Anyway what seemed like a disaster in October is like winning the
lottery now. Hamish's luck started to turn before Christmas. He got an
order for rape straw and was delivering it on his old lorry trailer. He
manages to get them four high on that though he has to watch for low
bridges. When he was passing through Maud he noticed that the mart was
in action, selling store cattle.
Now, half of those stores were only being sold because the farmers
were short of straw, and all the buyers know that the price will take
off once the end of the winter comes in sight. In a flash Hamish saw his
opportunity. He persuaded the auctioneer to interrupt his sale to find a
home for ''56 bales of rape straw on the trailer ootside''. They made
twice what I had paid for mine and Hamish's straw strade was off.
Now he's at #10 for barley and wheat and a fiver for spring rape
straw.
Mossie's selling straw too, ammonia treated stuff. At least he would
if he wasn't so greedy. He wants #60 a tonne for it. ''Not too bad,''
you might think with straw at #10 and the treatment costing #16 a tonne
and wrapping a couple of pounds a bale.
But Mossie's bales are five-and-a-half footers, baled with a
high-compression bailer. He weighed a few of them and they are
half-a-tonne each. That's #30 a bale he's asking.
Well, I'm saying nothing but I've about a hundred bales spare. And to
think some of us used to harvest the stuff with a marchbox.
The fact that I had all that wealth in the cornyard meant I went off
to Perth on Wednesday with confidence as well as the usual ambition to
buy a replacement for poor old Argus. It's an important job because when
you buy your bull you are buying half your herd.
I swore to be scientific. I swore to be careful. And, now that the
Breadwinner is at home doing the books and therefore cannot be fooled, I
swore not to go far above my limit of #3000.
The first to catch my eye was the junior champion, a bull so large I
wondered if I would be able to feed him through to the grass even with
all that spare straw. And he was bigger even than I thought for I
presumed, and even moved on with the idea, that he was the senior
champion. But that was a bigger bull altogether.
He was just the sort the pedigree breeders like. He was long, tall and
bonnie. Unfortunately for the seller he also had some difficulty in
negotiating the small and sloping ring and certainly spoiled himself
with one top breeder because of that.
And the seller was doubly unfortunate because long, tall and bonnie
isn't what the commercial men are looking for. They want size all right
but they want it at the back and they want to see loads of muscle on the
frame.
I should have bought that bull for he only just got over my official
limit. But buying is a very psychological affair. You can get bidding
constipation. It looks like a bargain, and then it is chapped out to
someone else and your hands are still in your pockets.
But at least that opened me up. Soon I was bidding away trying to
snatch something below three thousand. I certainly succeeded, though I
am not very proud of the manner of it.
This decent enough looking bull from Norfolk stuck at 1200gns. I
mentioned to my neighbour that he had a fabulous 400 day weight. He said
''and he's got a topper of an EBV''. Now I know that that is a very
scientific measure of everything that's known about the bull and if
theories worked it would be all you need to know to buy a bull, but I'd
never come across one before.
So I bid and got half my herd for 1300gns
Now my neighbour was Alan Fotheringham, a leader of that most
scientific of breeds, the Limousins, so I presumed his advice was good.
But on my other flank was Keith Redpath who, as a dealer, can't afford
many mistakes.
He kindly informed me that the figure on which I had bought my new
herdsire was not the EBV but the certainty with which the predicted
result would occur. On the real EBV, he was able to show us, my bull was
no better than average.
But then neither was his price.

GLASGOW Opportunities is not only co-ordinating the Enterprise
Roadshows. Its staff will also be on hand to give information about its
own training and business counselling services, most of which are run in
partnership with other agencies.
GO is the local enterprise trust for Glasgow. Initially set up as a
partnership between industry and the public sector to help new and small
businesses in the Glasgow area. It has in the past 11 years developed
and extended its role to help businesses of all types and all sizes and
has become a centre of information about financial support and training
opportunities for companies and individuals, bringing in the resources
and expertise of established companies to help new and developing
businesses.
Over the years GO has developed its services to include loan funds,
training for owners and managers, innovation counselling, venture
capital introduction and general promotional activities to encourage and
help people become self employed. Its ability to attract finance from
the private sector and to direct financial support to clients in both
the private and public sectors make it a unique organisation. GO now has
more than 60 private sector sponsors.
Other sponsors include the Glasgow Development Agency, Glasgow City
Council and Strathclyde Regional Council, all of which are taking part
in the Enterprise Roadshows starting tomorrow.
GO offers business counselling, advice and support to people wanting
to start up in business or to develop an existing business, and all its
services are free of charge.
Executive director Agnes Samuel said: ''We try to identify and fill
gaps in the provision of business support services and training and not
to duplicate what other agencies are already doing. Our work complements
other schemes and initiatives in the Glasgow area.
''We have become increasingly successful at accessing European funds,
mainly from the European Regional Development Fund and the European
Social Fund, both of which are managed in this area by the Strathclyde
Integrated Development Organisation.''
Training is a vital part of GO's activities. For the past six years it
has been the city's leading provider of business skills seminars,
offering more than 12,000 places. GO has also developed advanced
seminars on marketing, finance and management.
In partnership with private and public organisations GO organises
programmes of enterprise seminars to serve as tasters for companies and
encourage them to take advantage of other services and facilities.
Its business and human resource development programme is designed to
equip senior personnel to use the company's resources to the full to
improve planning, training and development. This programme is supported
by Glasgow City Council and the European Social Fund.
Within its offices GO has a training suite which can be hired by
companies or other organisations. The suite has a large reception area,
two fully equipped training rooms, dining area and separate kitchen.
Buffet meals can be provided if required. Both training rooms have a
full range of visual and other aids.

IF ever there was an industry facing a PR crisis it is farming today.
Let us list, in no particular order, some of the problems a corporate
PR might be asked to tackle if he won the brief to promote the farmers'
case.
First, there is the widespread public concern over the export of young
calves for the Continental veal trade and the export of live animals in
general.
Second, the claim that those animals which are destined to be
slaughtered nearer home may be badly treated in the auction markets.
Then comes the public perception that the farmer is a subsidy junkie who
will undertake no activity which is not supported by a grant of some
description.
Finally, the argument that intensive farming methods, with heavy
dosages of chemicals, place the farmer in the role of polluter rather
than preserver of the countryside.
Farmers are not unaware of the fact that they have an image problem.
The difficulty is knowing what to do about it. Some favour the hiring of
men in shiny suits to produce equally shiny PR material to show that
everything in the garden is rosy.
Others are casting about for a farmer/communicator, who can put the
public right on some misconceptions. Captain Ben Coutts has been doing
his bit in that regard this week. Those who criticise the castration of
young lambs should realise that, otherwise, stock would deteriorate
through rampant incest, he points out.
''Do city folk ever think of the stress on canaries in cages -- or on
big dogs in small flats?'' he wonders.
It does appear that an anti-farmer bandwagon is gaining speed at a
remarkable rate. In November, at the Smithfield Show in London, the
veal-calf issue was already coming to the fore. The animal rights
protestors outside Earls Court were, at best, desultory in their
picketing.
Only about eight weeks later we had Shoreham and Brightlingsea and
then the invitable death of a protestor under the wheels of a lorry.
Suddenly the stakes had been upped.
This week's BBC Frontline Scotland programme could only add to the
farmers' problems. It showed animals being roughly handled on their way
to the sale ring in a way which most people would find unacceptable.
The markets, of course, come under the control of the auction
companies and in the worst instances they were able to claim that the
people shown striking animals were not market employees. Sadly, one was
said to be an owner.
While such emotive scenes may be claimed to be isolated instances they
are definitely bad PR for both the farming and market businesses. The
solution is relatively easy. There is a market code which, if adhered
to, would resolve the issue. There seems little point in having staff
trained in animal handling if blatant breaches of the code are going to
be tolerated.
For their own sakes farmers might have to consider boycotting markets
which they considered were doing them a disservice on the PR front.
Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, who filmed the scenes in
the markets, has set out his demands as being that animals should be
reared under humane conditions, go through a humane marketing system and
reach a quiet death in the slaughterhouse. For a vegetarian that is a
reasonable stance.
Livestock farmers are already aware of the threat posed by
vegetarianism and have expressed concern at the ''brainwashing'' of
schoolchildren exposed to publicity from the vegetarian lobby. The Meat
and Livestock Commission also produces information packs for schools so
it is difficult to argue that the other side of the story should not be
represented.
Our own Charlie Allan has indicated that if his grandchildren's school
class is to be to be subjected to vegetarian propaganda he will demand
the right of reply.
As one Ayrshire farmer pointed out the vegetarians can be equally
accused of interrupting a life cycle. Most vegetables are harvested for
eating at a point before they have flowered and gone to seed -- which
would be the natural course of events. It may even be that a cabbage
lets out a scream as it is cut from the stalk.
Finally, the really big issue may prove to be the idea that farmers
are hooked on subsidies which add substantially to our food and tax
bills. Treasury Minister Jonathan Aitken weighed in last week with a
claim that the CAP was costing the average British family #28 a week.
His arithmetic is suspect. The cost person is less than 88p a week, or
#3.50p for a family of four. To arrive at Mr Aitken's total you have to
make a whole range of assumptions about world prices and the likely
effects of withdrawing CAP support.
Nonetheless, the impression is abroad that farmers are becoming an
expensive item and the main PR thrust of the disparate agriculture
industry will have to be deployed in that direction.

Washington, Sunday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton opened a meeting of Israeli and Arab foreign
ministers meant to revitalise the faltering Middle East peace process
today saying the United States would ''redouble our efforts to get the
peace process back in full gear.''
The meeting, presided over by Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
brought together foreign ministers from Israel, Jordan and Egypt and a
top Palestine Liberation Organisation aide. The peace process has been
deadlocked by Israeli-PLO differences over Palestinian self-rule plans.
''It is no secret to anyone in the world that we are at a criticial
moment in the peace process. We cannot allow the rise of terror again to
threaten this peace,'' Clinton said at the start of the meeting at Blair
House, an official government guest house opposite the White House.
''We are prepared in this country to redouble our efforts to get the
peace process back in full gear. We are doing what we can on our own and
with others to deal with the problem of terror,'' he said.
He hoped the meeting here would establish specific steps the parties
could take to keep the peace process going.--Reuter.

A BOARD game for pregnant women which hopes to teach a serious message
has been invented by student nurses Aileen Sharkey and Sheila Girvan,
from Lochaber.
They devised the dice and counters game, called Breast Feeding and
costing #40, designed to be played with qualified staff in hospital or
community health units, which is aimed at promoting breast feeding.
They hope their game, conceived while they were studying in Lochaber
at the Highland and Western Isles College of Midwifery, will be played
across the UK. It has been tried out on women attending the Belford
Hospital, Fort William.

BRIAN HENDERSON tried to dismiss public concern over live animal
exports by suggesting that anthropomorphism and sentimentality are the
driving force behind those who have taken to the streets in protest
(February 8).
He made much of doe-eyed images of calves and the cuddle factor of
fluffy lambs. Not once did he touch on the real reason why people who
have never protested before are standing in front of 40-tonne
articulated lorries.
These virgin volunteers are from ordinary homes in ordinary towns
which the media have placed in a mystical land called Middle England.
These unexceptional people were not urged to exceptional action by
popping a video in their VCRs and seeing Bambi's mum get the bullet.
They were shocked out of apathy by television pictures of calves
tethered in tiny Dutch veal crates and conscious lambs having their
throats slit in Greek and Spanish abattoirs. This technicolour cruelty
is real, not a fairy tale.
Deer farmers in Scotland do not send walking, talking Bambis abroad to
be sold as anonymous locally killed meat. Instead they export humanely
reared and killed venison with a Scottish label which attracts a premium
price. Do deer and sheep farmers never talk to each other? The live lamb
exporters could learn a thing or two.
As more people open their eyes to the cruelty of live export, veal
crates, and factory farming, our meat and egg producers are going to
have trouble justifying what they do to animals.

Sarajevo, Sunday
SNIPERS broke the relative calm Sarajevo today, wounding a 16-year-old
boy and a man, and Bosnian Serbs said Muslims shot a child in a Serb
suburb.
Doctors and United Nations staff confirmed the first attack.
Peacekeepers said they suspected the sniper fire came from Bosnian Serb
positions overlooking the besieged city.
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA later reported that a child had been
seriously wounded by a Muslim small arms attack in the Serb suburb of
Cekrcici. No further details were available.
The shootings were the latest violations of a truce which has eased
the danger to civilians in the city in recent days, allowing roads and a
railway to reopen to civilian traffic.
Doctors in Kosevo hospital said Dzemal Karovic, 16, had been shot in
the stomach. Mujo Klino, 43, was wounded when he went to help him.
The shootings occurred as Bosnian government and UN commanders met to
try to shore up a ceasefire battered by fighting around Bihac.
Apart from an isolated mortar attack, Sarajevo had enjoyed several
days of relative calm, with roads and a railway reopening to civilian
traffic as confidence built in the January 1 ceasefire holding in most
of Bosnia.
The situation in Bihac, in northwest Bosnia, has worried UN
peacekeepers who see the potential for current fighting around the
''safe area'' of Bihac town to spread elsewhere in Bosnia, ruining the
gains of the six-week-old ceasefire.
The UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith, met
Muslim government military chief General Rasim Delic in Visoko,
northwest of Sarajevo, today to try to rescue a ceasefire now
threatening to unravel.
''The main sticking point from the BH (Bosnian government army) point
of view is Bihac,'' UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward told
Reuters after the meeting.
Delic wanted Serb forces to relent in their attacks on Bihac and allow
aid to enter the area, Day said. If those two demands were met, Delic
might reconsider his refusal to attend talks with Serb commanders and
the UN on implementing the terms of the January 1 ceasefire, he
said.--Reuter.

I CAN assure Dr James Brown that not only does Eire export its calves
but it also exports a great amount of its cattle on the hoof as well
(February 7).
Britain is only allowed to ship livestock under six months of age
because of the BSE regulations. Eire on the other hand has no such
restrictions and is able not only to ship all cattle but has no
restrictions on destination. Most of its cattle are thus shipped on much
longer journeys than British livestock -- to Spain and Italy.
Eire has not been affected by the ferry ban because Dublin-based Irish
Ferries has continued to transport its livestock direct from Eire to
France, a sea journey of about 20 hours, much longer than the British
maximum ruling of 15 hours.
As to the moral question of exporting veal crates, I can assure Dr
Brown that there is no easy alternative.
What really amazes me is the RSPCA bringing out a video showing
animals being slaughtered in Greek abattoirs and labelling it barbaric.
Does it not realise that hundreds of cattle and sheep are slaughtered in
British abattoirs every day by the kosher method, part of a religious
killing as required by some cultures which I fully respect their right
to maintain.
If the Greek abattoirs are so barbaric it is up to Brussels to go and
shut them down as they have done to many British abattoirs for not being
up to EU standards.

IN the wake of the inquest into the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy in which
school pupils lost their lives while under the supervision of
non-qualified instructors, it is particularly saddening to discover that
Strathclyde Regional Council is contemplating closing its 10 outdoor

At these residential, outdoor education centres pupils from all

outdoor activities with the peace of mind that all staff are highly
qualified and operate under strict safety guidelines.

IT was with much interest that we read the Alf Young's report on the
job losses at Rolls-Royce at East Kilbride (February 2).
He is right to draw attention to the high-skill, high-wage aspect of
these jobs and the substantial knock-on effect they will have on the
local economy and the manufacturing base of Scotland.
Of the Scottish workforce, 3.2% is directly dependent on aerospace and
defence expenditure as opposed to the UK average of 2.9%.
Reductions in MoD expenditure and restructuring of our defence
industries has resulted in the loss, in Scotland, of some 20,000 jobs
since 1987. Around 10,000 of these have been in our manufacturing
companies.
However, these reductions in defence employment have not led to a
diversification of Scottish industry; in fact the opposite has occurred.
The devastating impact of the recession on Scottish industry coupled
with the trend towards service employment has resulted in our
manufacturing base becoming increasingly dependent on defence
expenditure.
The Scottish manufacturing base has risen from 4% defence dependency
in 1985 to 10.7% today. The situation is exacerbated in that our defence
companies represent for the most part the last bastion of successful
high-technology manufacturing in Scotland.
Many of Scotland's major companies and local communities are heavily
dependent on defence spending. Previous cuts are already adversely
affecting Scottish local economies.
Since 1984 Strathclyde manufacturing has decreased by more than 30%
and the lack of hi-tech manufacturing jobs continues to be a major cause
of concern. With aerospace and transport in Strathclyde already
experiencing the greatest absolute decrease in vacancies (down 91.8%),
the urgency for Government action to assist our aerospace and defence
industries and ensure that Scotland has the capabilities to enter the
new emerging markets, such as those for hi-tech, environmental clean
technologies, has never been greater.
The Trade and Industry Select Committee third report on the British
aerospace industry unanimously agreed on a number of recommendations,
calling on the Government to have an overall policy framework for these
industries and to commission a study to consider whether and how the
conversion of defence resources should be assisted.
Lobbying undertaken by the Arms Conversion Project has indicated
support for these commonsense proposals from across the political
spectrum. We now all have a duty to ensure that the Government responds
seriously to what Alf Young correctly recognises as a serious issue.

SCOTTISH lawyers of a certain age will recall a clerihew about a
famous old judge:
The nearest thing to death in life
Is David Patrick Maxwell Fyfe
But underneath his gloomy shell
He does himself extremely well
Maxwell Fyfe was Baron Fyfe of Dornoch, later Lord Kilmuir, a
remarkable old boy in many ways. A Highland landowner, Scots Guardsman,
and high Tory, he was created 1st Earl Kilmuir in 1962. By then he was
famous as an English judge who had also been deputy prosecutor at the
Nuremberg Nazi war-crime trials.
He was known for his grim persona and upper-class background which
tailor-made him for membership of the Carlton Club in London. Back in
Scotland he could have been found strolling in the Dornoch countryside.
He did, after all, own lots of it.
But Maxwell Fyfe was also the thinking man's European, so much so that
he was the force behind Britain's visionary contribution to the European
Convention of Human Rights. Today, 42 years after the convention came
into force, it is written into the domestic law of 32 of the 34 member
states in the Council of Europe.
All 34 states are democracies committed to respecting human rights,
parliamentary democracy, and the rule of law. The two which continue to
resist writing the convention into domestic law are -- no prizes for
guessing -- Britain and Ireland.
Under the aegis of the council, the European Court of Human Rights
meets in Strasbourg. In effect it is the ultimate court of appeal for
Europeans who believe they have been treated unfairly. Its decisions are
famous for regularly upsetting British judges. Last week it ordered
compensation for a convicted drug-peddler whose goods were confiscated
by an English judge invoking a European law which did not at that time
exist in domestic law. The prisoner complained that his punishment was
retrospective.
British courts have come sullenly to accept judgments of this kind
from Strasbourg but the political will to give the human rights court
full and formal recognition as the last resort in appeals procedure has
been lost during the Conservatives' long spell in office.
If old Maxwell Fyfe was around today -- he died in 1967 -- he would
probably be a Heathite when it comes to Europe in general and the
Council of Europe in particular. Like Churchill, Heath, and his
generation of Conservatives were Europeans by conviction who cared, in
the words of Harold Macmillan, more about the great issues of the world
than the price of butter.
Many present-day Tories, compelled to be reticent, feel the same,
which is why a pervasive sense of disappointment pervades the party.
A good example of this loss of the urge to be involved is our
Government's attitude to writing the convention into British law. It is
now a party-political issue wrapped up in the greater issue of
constitutional reform. Rather than bow with good grace to a modern and
useful charter which also serves as a last defence against injustice,
our Government and many judges -- especially, it must be said, Scottish
judges -- seem intent on watching the spectacle of our citizens going in
ever greater numbers to Strasbourg in search of fairness.
This is curiously perverse especially when, as I am led to believe,
the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay (a Scot), favours writing the European
convention into British law, with all that entails for a written
constitution. England's most senior judge, the Lord Chief Justice, is
known to take the Mackay view. In Scotland, greatest bastion of
resistance to Strasbourg, a pro-European view on this issue is also
advanced privately by our most senior judge, Lord Hope, Lord President
of the Court of Session.
Scottish resistance to the convention can be traced to two particular
cases. One involved a deportation and the other a complaint that a
Scottish trial had been unfair. The Scottish judicial system came out
the loser in both appeals to Strasbourg and great has been the mumping
and grumping from the Bench, or some of it, ever since. Other cases in
which the Strasbourg court has taken a firm line include a judgment
leading to the ban on belting children in state schools and the
''interrogation in depth'' of terrorist suspects.
British opposition to Strasbourg is mainly knee-jerking by
Establishment figures who see the incorporation of the human rights
convention into British law as the slippery slope to a written
constitution. As we watch the ever-increasing number of British cases
wending a way to Strasbourg in pursuit of justice -- 946 last year
although many will no doubt fall -- it is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that the slippier the slope the better.
Now that the possibility of a written constitution is taking on a new
urgency because of Labour's commitment to it -- indeed all parties
except the Tories are in favour -- it has become subsumed in the general
political debate about ''Europe''. Eurosceptics -- who must know better
-- shamelessly blame the EU for decisions of the Court of Human Rights.
Likewise they blame the Council of Europe and its court for EU policies
which displease them.
One of the obvious effects of not having the convention written into
British law is its influence on judges. In Scotland and England most of
them happily judge away, confident in the knowledge that they need not
look over their shoulders to Strasbourg. Thus they risk lengthening the
time it takes to resolve a case. If they knew at the outset that they
must respect the convention, much time and effort could be saved.
Meanwhile, today's Tories might reflect on the damage their refusal to
embrace Strasbourg is having on Britain's international reputation.

JOHN FOWLER describes the full moon rising at the horizon as
''gigantic'', and notices that it appears to get smaller as it climbs
the night sky (Weekender, February 4).
This is perfectly true and familiar to everyone, but it is
nevertheless an optical illusion. The disc of the moon is not magnified
by the atmosphere; it is always exactly the same size irrespective of
its position in the sky. Try viewing it through a hole cut in a card or,
better still, photograph it at levels throughout the evening.
He also says that it is sometimes possible to see the new moon
silhouetted against the Milky Way. Surely when the moon is new it is
nearly in line with the sun and therefore the Milky Way would not be
visible. You can certainly see the new moon as a black disc but then it
is against the sun during a solar eclipse.

JOHN MACLEOD is someone whom I would normally have some considerable
time for; however, his latest diatribe does not live up to his normal
high standard of journalism (February 7).
He derides the SNP advances in places like Paisley clearly without
checking the facts. If he had he would have discovered that the SNP
presence on the district council has increased from one councillor in
1979 to 12 elected at the last local elections, resulting in an overall
Labour loss of control in Scotland's fourth largest district council.
Similarly, in areas like Kilmarnock (the political home of Alex Neil,
another of John Macleod's ''victims'') the district council now has an
SNP provost and at the recent regional elections SNP wins in three out
of four regional wards, the last Labour survivor holding on by a handful
of votes.
These areas may not have returned SNP MPs but consistent progress
towards that is being achieved. John Macleod's comparison with Banff and
Buchan is disingenuous to say the least. Even he must recognise that
winning Tory votes against the background of a very unpopular Tory
Government is not quite the same task as winning votes in Labour areas
with Labour in opposition.
If Labour ever does win a General Election, our turn at this more
favourable position will come. This is not to say that I do not
appreciate the hard work involved in winning any seat in Scotland.

THOSE of us who hold Sir Nicholas Fairbairn in respect and affection
have greatly admired the courage and determination with which he has
fought his illness (February 3).
However, many of us will be unable to hide our disappointment that he
should disparage the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate
for this constituency, democratically elected at a well-attended
association selection meeting by those whose support Sir Nicholas
enjoyed in helping to secure his re-election in 1992.
A native of Lochaber, John Godfrey is a good, hard-working candidate
who will be able to bring valuable experience and dedication to the
constituency as MP. In this he would be following in the footsteps of
distinguished predecessors, among them Lord Home and, yes, Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn.

I WAS amused to read your article ''SNP takes a beating for Devil's
Island study trip'' (February 8).
Mr Macartney tries to defend the trip by saying that ''we must be the
only people to go to this place without being dragged there in chains''.
Once again his ignorance of historical events is plain to see as the
prison closed a number of years ago. I am sure the Guyanans, who are
trying to encourage a tourist industry, will be delighted with the
reference to chains.
I was also interested to see him describing himself as the
''Papillon'' of the European Parliament. I would point out that papillon
is French for butterfly, which we all know has a very short life.
Entirely appropriate I would have thought.
Furthermore, Henri Charriere, who based the story on his ''own
experiences'', was later exposed as a liar and a fraud.
Need I say more?

In Australia it is illegal to use a handset while the car is in motion

IN common with Alex M Smith I have seen some of my musical tastes
scorned in the columns of The Herald (February 7). Unlike him, however,
I do not regard this as an insult or grounds for any one writer's
dismissal.
Apparently he does not realise that one of the reasons for The
Herald's quality is its willingness to employ a wide variety of writers,
each with his or her own unique viewpoint.
If the newspaper were to respond positively to the rantings of every
ardent fan who had seen his idol criticised, we would be treated to no

I WAS both astonished and dismayed when I discovered last year that
neither BBC TV Scotland nor Scottish Television had filmed any of the
Celtic Connections festival concerts.
A year on I am now well and truly angered to find that the TV
companies have again ignored the festival. Here we have had, on two
occasions, the best performers of Celtic and Celtic-orientated music,
and yet they are apparently considered unworthy of TV appearances in one
of the Celtic countries.
Can it be doubted that there would have been large-scale coverage if
the world's best classical, rock, or jazz musicians had assembled in
Glasgow for such a festival?
One can only hope that the TV people have seen the error of their ways
and are, at this moment, planning to apologise to the Scottish public by
arranging extensive coverage of Celtic Connections in 1996.
More than a word of thanks is due, in the light of TV's neglect, to
all associated with Radio Scotland's Travelling Folk and Mr Anderson's
Fine Tunes, which did honour to the BBC commitment to indigenous
culture, and indeed to others from beyond our shores.

UNIVERSITIES are old institutions. Aberdeen, not Scotland's oldest, is
at present celebrating its 500th anniversary. No matter how long their
history, their role has changed dramatically over time, and few have
long enjoyed freedom from financial worry. Glasgow, the second Scottish
foundation after St Andrews, was actually established to avoid the
currency outflow Scotland suffered from students being educated on the
Continent. Aberdeen's raison d'etre was even more immediately practical
-- to provide a trained professional elite whose output from the two
other universities was insufficient to meet all of Scotland's needs. The
fact is that all were small institutions with tiny undergraduate bodies.
In early days, however, they established a reputation for scholarship
and its communication which blossomed, especially in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, with minimal intervention from the State.
Increasingly in this century state intervention has grown. The effect
has been enormous, especially in numbers, now that approximately a third
of each age cohort can expect to receive a tertiary education. The
numbers of universities have multiplied as well. Scottish medieval
foundations could have been far more numerous than what came to be
called the four ancient universities, but these are now overwhelmed by
more recent creations which may not even be the last.
It cannot be surprising that the pace of this change -- very marked
since the 1960s -- has produced a widespread feeling of stress. The
recommendations of the Robbins Report ensured that existing universities
would be massively expanded and that new foundations would extend their
benefits far beyond the old elite groups. The effects of the ensuing
growth have been compounded in the past two decades by attempts to
promote an ''enterprise culture'' in the universities while keeping
their budgets under tight constraints. The Moderator of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland was speaking for many yesterday in
Aberdeen when he defended university education from ''the whims of
accountants and market forces''. Contemporary tensions among university
teachers are everywhere evident. All notice their greatly increased
workload (both in teaching and in bureaucratic demands) and many dislike
what they identify as a business ethos being imposed on them.
These latter fears have an adverse effect on morale but they may be
exaggerated. As in so many spheres it is a matter of balance.
Traditionalists are wont to forget the way in which nineteenth-century
academic life was often closely involved in economic enterprise -- the
career of Lord Kelvin, though in many ways exceptional, makes the point
well enough. So does the manner in which many academic institutions were
funded by what is often called ''new'' money (capitalism) as by old
(land). It would be a flight from reason were academic institutions now
to ignore the benefits accountants can provide for their better
management. And ''market forces'' should not always be dismissed as
philistine, when they merely show what people want. It is up to
academics themselves to see that what are essentially auxiliaries
(accountants) do not become dictators; and that what is wanted of
universities is considered before it is delivered, assuming the eventual
decision is to deliver it. Universities can say ''no'', though their
ability to do so to the State has been undermined along with their
financial independence. No university should be driven by mere ''whim''
in any circumstance.

SHORTLY after he first broke through he became known as the ''new''
Gary Cooper and Steve McQueen and a long list of other Hollywood
legendary leading men, but Kevin Costner seemed to be different.
Whatever demons lurked he appeared to have overcome them, although he
frankly admitted to having ''a dark side''.
It sounded like some public-relations spice, for there seemed no
shades to him. He was white bread possibly in need of some Tinseltown
toasting, of gossip-page character-building. In Hollywood if they're not
talking about you it's time to plan your memorial service -- that way
someone comes to see you.
When I first met Costner he had just completed No Way Out which
boasted a strong cast, a complex plot with a clever twist, and a raunchy
sex scene involving Kev and co-star Sean Young in the back seat of a
limousine driving around and around the historic sights of Washington
DC. It was an exotic trip.
But the limousine-lover image was not him, he said. The love scenes
were difficult, embarrassing. Sean Young, more experienced in such brief
celluloid encounters, helped him.
Since then, Costner has helped himself to the handsome pickings of
Hollywood, the rainbow of fame, money, and Oscars. Now, certainly
privately and possibly professionally, it has all gone wrong. The man
who seemed to be above the temptations of celebrity while having an
uncanny knack at the box-office has stumbled. And film-industry types
are talking about his latest film, Waterworld -- the most expensive
movie ever made -- as his Waterloo.
His wife Cindy -- she paid her way through college by appearing as
Snow White at California's Disneyland -- has filed for divorce after 16
years of marriage. It is a bitter battle. There has been much gossip
about Costner's serial philandering. In the middle of this dodgem
divorce are their children Annie, 10, Lily, 7, and Joe, 6.
The man who for a moment seemed to have it all, the perfect marriage
and family, the superstar career, finds himself in a corner. It is a
surprise to most for he appeared always to be in control and to be his
own man. No better example was his Oscar bonanza, Dances with Wolves,
which the film industry predicted would be his demise. With his wife's
support he thumbed his nose at the doomwatchers and against the odds
turned an over-long film into a box-office and critical success. He was
the maverick's maverick.
And arguably that's when the cracks in the plaster began to appear.
Here we had a brand-new all-round film genius, a lean, lanky Orson
Welles, who could do no wrong. That, of course, is when you get ego all
over your face.
Costner will talk until the cowboys come home -- or until his PR
minders tap their Rolexes -- when you get him on the subject of the epic
Western that brought him everything Hollywood dreams of: money, power,
status, and the sort of sensational, life-changing superstardom some
live to regret.
He was always aware of the pitfalls but says he wouldn't change a
minute of his experience in bringing Dances with Wolves to the screen.
It was simply ''the one film in my life I knew I had to make even if it
meant I could never make another''.
At one stage it looked as if that might be the case. Costner turned
down some of the best leading-man roles on offer -- Presumed Innocent
(which went to Harrison Ford), The Hunt for Red October (Alec Baldwin),
Bonfire of the Vanities (Tom Hanks) -- which turned out to be a lucky
miss -- and Prince of Tides (Nick Nolte), and spent two years trying to
convince Hollywood to give him $18m and let him produce, direct, and
star in a three-hour Western about peace, love, racial injustice, and
Sioux Indians.
Amid gossip about a stupendous ''Kevinsgate'' flop, first-time
director Costner kept his cool -- and his faith in his vision, the film
he still describes as ''my love letter to the past''. On Oscar night,
1991, he was vindicated: Dances won him seven Oscars including Best
Picture and Best Director. He also won the prestigious Directors' Guild
Director of the Year and an armful of Golden Globes.
Before Dances, Costner had been little more than a Hollywood pretty
boy, a sexy stud to the smouldering Sean Young in No Way Out -- she
called him ''shy, puritanical, and such a private guy'' and worried that
she'd embarrassed him during their electrifying sex scene -- and the
artfully passionate toe-nail painter of Susan Sarandon in Bull Durham.
He'd made a lot of people, notably Sean Connery, dance on their toes
in the brilliant The Untouchables and the word was out, at last, that he
was a star in the making when he took his all-or-nothing gamble on
Dances.
Afterwards he was as famous as Madonna was infamous. The two icons
met, famously, backstage after her show. He, polite, earnest, a strictly
brought-up Californian working-class boy, told her her show was
''neat''. She stuck her fingers down her throat as he left, a moment
captured on her no-frames-banned video that signalled ''square'' to the
world.
The incident seemed to sum up the essential Costner. He was ''nice'',
polite, and honest, a man of his word and a loving family man out of
place in back-stabbing, fingers-down-your-throat Hollywood. He also
talked the image: ''You like to think you do the right thing. It's the
way we were brought up.'' His father Bill, a former railwayman, says:
''All the Costners are good men.'' Whenever possible his wife Cindy, a
woman who insisted on keeping her marriage and family as private as
possible, and the children would travel on location with him. They were
on the set of Dances in South Dakota, appearing as pioneers in the
opening scene, and Cindy helped to release tensions by organising
parties, including a Hawaiian luau and a 1950s prom.
The couple were just like 1950s prom sweethearts when they met in 1978
-- she was shy, he was shyer; she was Snow White while he was, he says,
''a bit like Goofy, a late developer''. He's made up for it, and until
the divorce action, whatever the rumours of his attraction to women and
vice-versa, he maintained that Cindy and the children were the most
important thing in his life.
He knew of the danger his superstardom had brought to his marriage:
24-hour days living and breathing work, 24-hour days of women throwing
themselves at him, at work, camping outside his homes in Pasadena and
Malibu and wherever he might go. The possibility of dangerous liaisons
were, he said, ''the coolest thing. Are you kidding? To undress
somebody? To be undressed? To be physically, somehow, just taken?''
Before the divorce action he said his marriage ''isn't perfect'' and
his brother-in-law David Silva agreed: ''It wasn't easy when he first
became so famous. But Cindy grew with it real well.'' Costner's brother
Danny, his financial adviser, said: ''It got to be tough on Cindy. The
business is such an emotional roller-coaster. It's bigger than life and
the stakes are high.''
Not only is his domestic situation nasty; there are also a great many
waves surrounding Waterworld. The film was given the go-ahead by
Universal Studios with a budget of $100m. Now the cost is estimated at
more than $200m once the cost of marketing and prints of the film are
included. Although filming should have been completed last year the
movie still goes on being made.
All involved are so nervous about the situation that a giant water
tank on a Hollywood lot is hidden behind blue sheeting and scaffolding.
Security guards patrol the perimeter around the clock. ''Everyone is
very paranoid at this point,'' was the very unofficial word from the
set.
They are just as nervy down at the City of Commerce, where a replica
of a hugh supertanker, a great, rusting hulk, is also being used to
complete some of the action sequences of Waterworld.
Universal Studios, which clearly has a massive investment in Costner's
movie, is concerned that its star's personal problems, lots of gossip
about turmoil during filming, sackings, and overspending, will jinx the
film before it reaches cinemas this summer.
It has, at present, all the hallmarks of Arnold Schwarzenegger's
box-office belly-flop, Last American Hero. But, of course, no-one has
seen the film. Costner was written off with Dances and the snipers are
still keen to knock him off his pedestal. Financially, they've got a
good shot.
Jurassic Park cost $57m to make and in America and Canada alone
returned $357m.
What does a $200m film have to make to become a ''blockbuster''? The
answer is an awful lot.
Waterworld is a strong adventure movie. The director is Costner's
friend Kevin Reynolds (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and is a Mad
Max-on-the-water-story. The Polar ice-caps have melted and the earth is
submerging into the water in the post-apocalyptic future.
Costner plays Mariner, who sounds like something out of Star Trek,
part human and also amphibian. Instead of Mr Spock pointy ears this
hybrid sports long shaggy hair and a beard and doesn't say a lot. The
carefully guarded script has been leaked a little -- well, it would in a
water movie -- and concerns Mariner rescuing a woman and her daughter
who are being attacked by pirates. He takes them on a quest to find the
rumoured dry land.
The co-stars include Dennis Hopper (chief nasty, we can only presume
at this stage) and Jeanne Tripplehorn who in the sex stakes makes
mincemeat of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. The actress, who also
played Tom Cruise's wife in The Firm, is, we're told, a felony
scene-stealer in the film.
The screenplay is packed with action and was conceived by writers
including those involved with Harrison Ford's The Fugitive and Keanu
Reeves's Speed. But although Kevin Reynolds is the director, this is
Costner's project.
And he needs a hit. Even with Clint Eastwood as his co-star A Perfect
World only managed a little more than $30m in America. The US domestic
take for Wyatt Earp was $25m and The War made $16.5m.
Whether Waterworld can ever make the production costs back is in
question. Filming began on June 27 last year on the big island of Hawaii
and is not expected to end until later this month. Normal production of
a full-scale action film would be three, or at the most four, months.
The stand-by date for the end of filming was February 10. But
post-production takes at least 18 weeks and Universal wants to get
Waterworld in cinemas for the big American summer market.
Great Jurassic Park-type marketing -- Universal also bankrolled the
Spielberg movie -- is planned for Waterworld and will involve
attractions at the studio's theme park and inter-active computer games.
And, maybe, Kevin Costner ''Sink or Swim'' T-shirts.

MENACED by threats of more suicide attacks, Algerian security forces
killed 20 Muslim fundamentalists, half of them tracked down and slain in
a single operation, their officers said yesterday. In the north African
country's merciless conflict, two young men, suspected Islamists barely
in their 20s, pumped two bullets into the head of a woman schoolteacher
in an Algiers suburb on Saturday.
On the same day, 10 of their colleagues were slain by security forces
in Mascara, 195 miles to the west, in a ''search operation''. Security
officers, in a statement carried by the official news agency APS, said
their men who killed the 10 recovered guns, daggers and a bomb. The
other 10 were killed in seven different areas.

WHAT do they make of it, those Europeans who stand on the mainland of
the Continent this morning and try to make sense of our governing
party's attitudes to the European Union? More importantly, does it
matter what they think? We would argue most emphatically that it does.
The old days of arrogant insouciance have gone. Quite simply, what the
rest of Europe thinks about Britain does matter for the simple reason
that, although we remain geographically insular, we cannot afford even
to pretend to be uninfluenced or unresponsive to the nations with whom
we are joined in union. The direction of much of our manufacturing
export towards Europe, and the persistently unsatisfactory state of our
trade with the world outside the European Union, merely reinforces this
point. Furthermore, although senior British industrialists may be
agnostic about the absolute necessity of being part of a European
monetary system, none of them would argue with the requirement for
Britain's influence within Europe to be strong and persistent. That is
our future, whether we are enthused by it or not.
And so we return to our original question. What does Europe think
about us now? There is evidence that a number of European governments
are becoming increasingly puzzled and restive about what they hear and
see from Britain. It is true that this past weekend has been a bad one.
Lord Tebbit's speech at the Young Conservative's conference was a
disgrace. If he were a footballer he could be charged with bringing the
game into disrepute; as he is a politician we can only comment that any
allegedly senior statesman who appears to be talking about disobeying
laws which he does not like and who, grotesquely, makes a comparison
between the experience of a Briton in Europe with a South African black
under apartheid, is either dangerously provocative or unhinged. Other
voices were involved. The Home Secretary made an extremely Euro-sceptic
speech at the same conference and a pro-European Tory called for the
winding-up of the Young Conservatives because their views were becoming
more akin to the National Front. Soothing words came from other sources
but the emollient approach is not working. Perhaps, in a sense, it
should not. The admirable Sir Marcus Fox made an appeal over the weekend
for a stop to the squabbling. Cabinet Ministers should pause before
entering into a debate between one or the other, he said, but in the
present confusion an honest debate may be the only way of achieving some
sort of coherence.
The growing unease about the face Britain presents to the world is not
just a question of the moment. The present Government could be in power
for another two years. In that time, and if matters are not resolved,
the damage done to Britain's reputation, both inside and outside Europe,
could be immeasurable. The point about perceptions outside Europe is not
fully appreciated. It is clear that the White House prefers to speak to
a conglomerate Europe rather than to individual countries. (When it
wants to speak to a single country there have long been signs that
Germany is the preferred nation, making nonsensical fiction the notion
of a special relationship in any sense that really matters.) Nor are
Japanese inward investors impressed. There is much sense in what the
extreme Euro anti-sceptic Tony Marlow MP said at the weekend. He told
the Prime Minister to gain control or resign. It is impossible to
govern, he said, by eternally seeking the centre of gravity of the Tory
Party. Mr Marlow is right. Mr Major must resolve this damaging affair or
face the consequences.

TWO years ago Chancellor Ken Clarke told the Tory conference in true
best-mates style: ''Any enemy of John Major is an enemy of mine.'' They
now seem to be the best of enemies. They ''help'' each other with
speeches, but they say different things on Europe. Mr Clarke, for
example, declares that we can have monetary union without wholesale
political union. It took only this to upset Mr Major's applecart.
Two years ago Charles Wardle, then immigration minister, warned the
Prime Minister that failure to deal with immigration from Europe would
lead to ''massive public disenchantment''. Mr Major regarded the issue
differently and did not react.
Yesterday, Mr Wardle resigned from his Government. Mr Clarke and Mr
Wardle are friends and allies on European issues, but there appears to
be no connection between the Chancellor's statement last Thursday and Mr
Wardle's words yesterday after quitting Trade and Industry, where he was
reshuffled last July.
The link is that both events intensify Mr Major's difficulties in
uniting his Government on economic and political issues, particularly
those arising out of membership of the European Union. He is exposed
again to ridicule, as was Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home 30 years
ago when he observed: ''There are two problems in my life. The political
ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible.''
Nine months later Sir Alec (Lord Home of the Hirsel) was out of
office. One wonders how much longer Mr Major can continue without more
senior resignations on principle than Mr Wardle's junior post. His
political problems of Britain-at-the-heart-of-Europe seem insoluble and
the economic factors arising therefrom, too incomprehensible to
contemplate now.
He thought after Christmas that he had drawn up a sensible line for
the whole party to take in the circumstances. If our Euro-partners try
to force a single currency, or an end to national vetoes, in the next
two years, he will block it. There is no point in arguing about a single
currency now because it is not going to happen in the foreseeable
future.
He intensified his sceptical tone in the hope that his rebels would be
appeased and restore his majority in the Commons. He refused to commit
himself to a referendum on Britain's future in Europe and he refused to
say ''never'' to a single currency.
With some logic he quoted our Maastricht opt-out on this issue; a
decision on a single currency will be taken by a Parliament other than
this one. The latest statement of Labour policy on this issue by Shadow
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is hardly distinguishable.
A pro-European union Tory backlash was inevitable when people like Sir
Edward Heath voiced their alarm at what they saw as a dangerous
pandering to colleagues who take a hard-line distrustful view. Alas,
when they held a press conference, no-one turned up. Their champion Ken
Clarke was pushed forward for a speech last Thursday, introduced by one
of them, Hugh Dykes, as ''the fightback starts here''.
The Chancellor had hardly sat down when the Tory rebels were on to
him. He rejected ''knee-jerk reactions'' against a single currency.
This, of course, irritated King Knee-jerk himself, Lord Tebbit. But Mr
Clarke also declared at a European Movement dinner: ''It is quite
possible to have monetary union without political union. It is a mistake
to believe that monetary union need be a huge step on the path to a
federal Europe.''
This irritated the Cabinet hardliners and provoked prompt retaliation.
Employment Secretary Mr Portillo observed that such personal opinions
were not helpful. He failed to reprimand himself last May when he
opined: ''Single currency would mean giving up the government of the UK.
No British Government can give that up. It's impossible.''
Welsh Secretary John Redwood intervened: ''It is not just an economic
issue. It is a very big constitutional issue as well.'' Perhaps their
chagrin was greater because they knew that the Prime Minister had vetted
the Clarke speech and cleared the final text. Some of Mr Major's enemies
smell a conspiracy between Major and Clarke to restore the equanimity of
the ardent Europeans. If so, perhaps they are the best of friends still.
But this conspiracy theory seems too far-fetched.
The Chancellor's No 2 at the Treasury, Mr Jonathan Aitken, another
hardliner, has so far constrained himself (out of courtesy to his
boss?). But he had already said his piece eight days ago on television.
''I don't want to see a single currency, period. For as far as I can
possibly foresee. I would hesitate for an eternity before I came out and
said that I would vote for a single currency.''
Was it this that set off the Tory Europhiles? Mr Aitken appeared to
them to be exploiting the Prime Minister's tactical nod to the
Eurosceptics. Up to that point all involved believed that cabinet
ministers were agreed on not stirring things up. Mr Major has taken to
having one-to-one lunches with them in recent weeks in order to reach
one-to-one understandings with them.
There is no more serious European legislation this parliamentary year.
It seemed like a good opportunity for the Tories to patch-up and
shut-up. So much for that. In vain Mr David Hunt, the Cabinet
troubleshooter, pleaded yesterday that ''we must stop fighting with
shadows''.
He would have us believe that cabinet ministers are not saying
different things, merely saying things differently. Meanwhile, Mr Major
calls Mr Tony Blair a ''dimwit'' for probing the Prime Minister's
position. The Tory plan was to establish ''clear blue water'' between
them and Labour on Europe by forcing Blair to commit himself to a single
currency and a central bank.
''Dimwit'' Blair was on to this and has avoided it, despite the
utterances of some of his members of the European Parliament. So far Mr
Major has managed only to re-establish clear blue water between himself
and other groups in his cabinet and party. There is no sign of rejoining
by the nine MPs who are off the whip.
From their point of view they are exploiting being centre-stage and
see no point in switching off the spotlights. If things get much worse,
Mr Major faces a rebellion on the other side, with Europhiles resigning
the whip. If the Ulster Unionists were to abandon him too, it could be
that all these irksome problems will be taken right out of his hands.
Who could blame him if, in the private recesses of his mind, he tired
of all this and wished for release? His party and colleagues are putting
him in an impossible position in which he is denied all he asks for -- a
temporary truce to allow them to wait and see what real decisions they
have to face about Europe.
He is like a man trying to ride two horses without having a firm seat
on either of them. His impatient colleagues impart defeatism by their
apparent disregard for their leader's position. We are entitled to
deduce that they are already jostling for their own positions come
electoral defeat.
So far Mr Major has managed only to re-establish clear blue water
between himself and other groups in his cabinet and party

NOW that the removal men have gone and I settle into a new position, a
new day, the need for reassurance that I'm still in the same world is
not hard to find. The fate of Aberdeen's football manager, Willie
Miller, is an immediate reminder that we live in harsh, unfeeling times
where nothing really matters but so-called success.
To the extent that football is a metaphor for life, reflecting with
chilling accuracy the changing moods and attitudes of the human
condition, I am tempted to escape with the distant memory of a visit to
Malta, that Mediterranean haven dusted with yellow ochre and inducing a
sense of calm and well-being.
Ulysses was lured to live here and so was Nicholas Monsarrat of The
Cruel Sea. But I wouldn't have exchanged either for the man who was
ambling towards me now in the main street of Valletta and whose approach
I absorbed with a silent awe.
At that time resident in Malta, Stanley Matthews remained the greatest
football artist I had ever seen, an aristocrat of sport, brilliant
psychologist who proceeded that day to give me a limited insight into
the mystique of a legend.
Demonstrating how he would take a ball close to his opponent,
encouraging a false sense that the poor chap had cornered him, he would
then streak past with such sleight-of-feet as to induce a dose of
demoralisation.
''In that way I caused an inferiority complex from which my opponent
did not easily recover,'' said Matthews almost apologetically, given
that the man was by nature a gentleman.
We raked over a remarkable career, in which he was still playing for
England in his forties and gained a knighthood while still playing
top-grade football at 50.
When we met in Malta, Sir Stan the Peter Pan was turning out for his
local team in his sixties -- and he could be found playing in charity
matches well into his seventies.
The different mood of his heyday can be judged from the fact that,
even when he was reducing our full-backs to helpless jellies, he could
still raise Scottish spectators to their feet in spontaneous
acknowledgement of his genius. Today, he would be an English
unmentionable.
Yet for all that talent, he was 38 before he savoured the joy of a Cup
Final victory at Wembley, inspiring Blackpool to a late win over Bolton.
The point is that the sheer magic of people like Matthews rendered
matters like winning cups of lesser importance.
There were young people who would happily grow old with nothing but
exquisite memories of individual performance.
It all came back last week, when Sir Stanley was celebrating his 80th
birthday. One of the statistics raised on the day, now quite hard to
believe, was that, not only did Matthews create a record for length of
career but he did so without a single yellow-card of caution -- and
without even one foul having been given against him!
With that kind of standard, is it any wonder that my more mellow
generation placed him on a hero's pedestal?
What a different world confronts our youth today. At a time when
examples of karate-kicking and other forms of assault are given by the
stars and role-models of the moment, is it too surprising that a new
report reveals an alarming upsurge of school playground injuries from .
. . yes, karate-kicks etc?
Similarly, the thuggery which erupted at Chelsea last week merely
symbolises the mood of aggression which is everywhere in our society.
Never mind the quality, smell the success at any price: that is the
demand of the day, whether in business, sport, or any other aspect of
life.
And that brings us back to Willie Miller, the Aberdeen manager sacked
last week after three years of failing to win a cup.
Three years? Permit his sardonic smile as he considers the record of
predecessors. The first two managers of Aberdeen FC, Jimmy Philip and
Paddy Travers, ran the club from 1903 till 1938 without a single trophy.
Thirty-five years -- and neither was sacked! Elderly Aberdonians are
just happy to remember great players, like Alec Jackson, Willie Mills,
George Hamilton.
Nowadays it is all about winning; all about beating Rangers and
Celtic. And in that respect, the same Willie Miller who led Aberdeen to
unthinkable success as their greatest playing legend walked out of
Pittodrie with the ring of managerial failure in his ears.
When the dust has settled, I know that in reflective moments I shall
think more about that night in 1983 when the same Willie Miller stepped
up to receive the trophy which hailed Aberdeen at the top of European
football.
At the banquet in Gothenburg I eavesdropped on a classic exchange as
Miller and his imperturbable chairman, Dick Donald, met for the first
time since the greatest moment of their respective lives.
Moving along the buffet table, without breaking step, Dick said:
''Well well Willie, it's been quite a night.''
''Ay,'' said the inscrutable Willie, ''so it has.''
That night, he set a standard of unreasonable expectation which, by
the irony of a cruel world, led to his own heartbreaking downfall last
week. The Fallen Idol of Pittodrie had failed the ultimate test of our
modern, sophisticated and so-called caring society.

SKINHEADS in Vienna trampled on candles lit in memory of four gypsies
murdered last week in the worst suspected neo-Nazi bomb attack in
Austria since the Second World War, human rights activists said
yesterday. Two groups of skinheads kicked and stamped on scores of
candles placed on the steps leading to the church early yesterday, the
Austrian news agency APA quoted activists as saying.

I MEAN it's one thing with teenagers, top-shelf magazines, Italian TV
shows of dubious pedigree. But what do we delicate, sensitive Scottish
souls do when the Kirk also becomes obsessed with sex? For those of you
who have inexplicably mislaid your current copy of Circle of Care, the
esteemed journal of the Church of Scotland's Board of Social
Responsibility, let me give you a flavour. The Convener, the Rev Bill
Wallace, has devoted his 40 score words and 10 to the subject of saunas.
Saunas in the nation's capital. Those particular saunas where sitting in
dry heat in wooden Swedish-style cabins seems something of an optional
extra. Those saunas, not to be mealy around the mouth about it, where
what is on offer is paid-for sexual intercourse in rather more
comfortable surroundings than are normally to be found up the average
closemouth.
Mr Wallace is much exercised by the fact that the Embra city council
has chosen to license such establishments in the full knowledge that
they are contravening the Trade Descriptions Act more than somewhat.
Though doubtless, if you still have the energy and the inclination, a
sauna is still available under the ''will there be anything else, sir?''
clause to those gentlemen who are not hurrying on to a pressing previous
engagement.
Mr Wallace's basic case is that the council is at least contravening
the spirit and very probably the letter of the law on prostitution. He
reckons, too, though I'm not entirely clear on what basis, that
prostitution on the streets has actually increased rather than declined
since the new policy, and that business is also booming in those saunas
operating as de facto brothels.
But what seems to trouble him most is that ''in the past women became
involved in prostitution because of poverty, previous abuse, to fund a
drug habit, or even to pay fines. We now have a situation where women
with good looks, good background, and good jobs are drawn into
prostitution because of the easy, tax-free money they can earn in the
saunas . . . clearly there are lots of disturbed men out there who are
prepared to pay almost anything for sexual activity.''
Ahem. Could we check that out once more, Bill? Are we saying here that
it's regrettable but typical that poor, abused women sell sex, but
absolutely beyond the pale if they're going home to Bearsden or
Morningside? Does the clerical shock threshold have some sort of
sociological sliding scale? And while we're on the replay button, let's
just reprise that interesting phrase, ''disturbed men''.
Now my field research into prostitution may be somewhat limited, but
what is not in dispute from prostitutes, police, or health workers is
that the clientele mirrors society itself. The men who use prostitutes
do so for a wide variety of reasons and come from every conceivable
background. Some of them may or may not be disturbed. Most of them are
in the market for nothing more complex than sex without strings. A
facility, I have to tell you, that many single, widowed, divorced,
frustrated, or unhappily married women envy them.
Nobody would quibble with the assertion that sex is most satisfying
within the context of a loving, committed relationship. But if people
are denied access to gourmet meals is it realistic to close down the
burger bars?
As for the wider range of women who become prostitutes from choice
rather than necessity, it doesn't actually seem anybody's business but
their own. I talked with a group of them in Edinburgh just before making
a radio programme on the subject a couple of months back. They were
bright, confident, and unrepentant. They said that they could quite see
that many women couldn't contemplate that kind of ''career'', but it
worked for them. They said the sauna option gave them protection from
pimps, a healthy environment, and an opportunity to support their family
in a manner few other jobs could offer.
Now most women would not be in the market for soulless sex with
strangers. But Bill Wallace's contention is that prostitution is
''always wrong''. That women need ''helped towards a better lifestyle''.
And if they're on the game for all the wrong kind of reasons that's
fine. If they've been forced on the street to keep themselves fed and
warm, let's give them choices and support. If they're being exploited by
cynical, brutal crooks let's rescue them. But if they've made a free,
unfettered decision, what gives any of us the right to lecture them on
the supposed error of their ways? Prostitution has been around as long
as sex, and has about as much chance of going out of fashion. In which
case doesn't it make some kind of sense to regulate and decriminalise
it?
And if the Kirk wasn't so hung up on sex, if it didn't persist in
making it matter more than it does, it wouldn't keep getting its dog
collar in such a fankle. Look at the anguished hours spent at last
year's General Assembly discussing the reports on human sexuality and
marriage. All the fervent hand-wringing over whether or not God could
love cohabitees, or homosexuals could be proper grown-up Christians.
Just like the present Government, some elements in the Church have got
themselves hung up on a nostalgia trip; desperate to get back to a set
of basics where the nuclear family sent their kids to Sunday school,
rarely got divorced, and claimed they'd never got past a serious fumble
in the back row of the ABC1 before they hit the altar. Conveniently
missing from this playback are people who were locked in miserable
relationships, illegitimate children treated as third-class citizens,
and wives with chattel status at best.
The Kirk's Board of Social Responsibility, at its fairest and finest,
is exactly what its title implies. It operates as an invaluable safety
net for all kinds of human disasters for which the State can't or won't
pick up the tab. In matters of care it is pure dead brilliant. Could it
please just get the hell out of our bedrooms?

NEARLY 60% of registered voters turned out for yesterday's second
round of elections in Maharashtra, India's most industrialised state,
and the figure could rise to a new record turnout, early estimates said.
Women took part in unprecedented numbers, and analysts said this could
reflect a late surge in support for the embattled Congress government
led by chief minister Sharad Pawar.

A TUC report dismantling Government claims that its policy of labour
market deregulation has increased employment has been submitted to the
International Labour Organisation.
According to the TUC, the report Has Deregulation Delivered the Jobs?
answers its own question emphatically by proving Government claims on
the level of employment to be ''misleading and inaccurate''.
Today, the report goes to the ILO Committee of Experts, which is
considering how well Britain has complied with the ILO requirement for
signatories to pursue policies for full employment.
The TUC sees its report as the first comprehensive challenge to the
Government's portrayal of a successful record on jobs. It was produced
as a factual rebuttal to provide the Committee of Experts with accepted
figures rather than Government statements.
The study also challenges the way a recent Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development report on Britain uncritically accepted the
Government's view in a ''factually inaccurate and partial report on the
state of the UK labour market''.
The TUC's general secretary, Mr John Monks, said yesterday that the
Government's claims that its policy of deregulation had expanded the
jobs market did not stand up to serious scrutiny. Instead, it had led to
fear and insecurity among part-time workers, those on short-term
contracts, and the self-employed. ''Government Ministers should study
our report to discover where the economic feel-good factor has gone,''
he said.
The report does not accept Government claims that employment fell and
employment expanded unusually early in this recovery, by stressing that
unemployment fell in 1993 because more people were forced out of the
labour market, not because more jobs were created.
Ministers' claims that they are giving more help to the unemployed are
countered by revelations that Britain has cut spending on active labour
market measures as a share of Gross Domestic Product to barely half the
EU average, and reduced help for the unemployed by 35% in real terms
since 1989-90. In addition, the budget for Training for Work, the only
scheme to train the long-term unemployed, is to be cut by 20% in cash
terms over the next three years.
The TUC criticises Government claims that deregulation has created a
more ''flexible'' workforce, with more working part-time or being
self-employed. Instead, says the TUC, more people are ''flexible''
because they are scared of losing their jobs.
Suggestions that youth unemployment has declined are answered by the
TUC saying that it worsened against the national average last year, and
that for the under-20s it went up from 10% to 19% between 1990 and 1994.
* The ILO Employment Convention 122 calls on members to ''pursue as a
major goal an active policy designed to promote full employment'' and
that this should ensure ''there is work for all who are available for
and seeking work''.

Kirsty Scott reports how dire warnings of a flood of immigrants to
Britain because of EU regulations has been condemned by race relations
workers as divisive scaremongering
BY EARLY yesterday afternoon Charles Wardle's farewell vision of a
powerless Britain swamped by uncontrolled immigration had become the
latest twist in the row over Conservative divisions on Europe.
For community relations officials, however, it remained a fanciful and
xenophobic notion, and a dangerously divisive way of political
point-scoring.
As the Prime Minister promised Britain's borders would not be left
unchecked and denied his Ministers were heading every which way but
together on the European question, race relations representatives were
trying to marry Wardle's vision with the reality of immigration in the
UK and Europe.
''What he said is appalling, absolutely incredible,'' said Maggie
Chetty, senior community relations officer with Strathclyde Community
Relations Council. ''It is so far from the experience of what's
happening to people on the ground.''
Wardle's basic premise was that Britain had given away its right to
keep out a flood of legal and illegal immigrants under European
legislation. He said that the 1985 opt-out that supposedly preserved
British immigration controls was not worth the paper it was written on.
Chetty said immigration in the UK had been tightened so far in recent
years that it was virtually impossible to get in. The situation in
Europe was also very tough.
The first major tightening of immigration rules in Britain came in the
1971 Immigration Act, said Chetty. In the early 1980s further changes
were made through the Nationality and Citizenship legislation and
primary immigration was stopped. In the early 1990s visa restrictions
were brought in for countries including Nigeria, India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh. Last May, the Government announced that wealthy would-be
immigrants willing to invest in Britain would be able to bypass usual
immigration rules and apply to live in the UK for one year.
''Ordinary immigration has completely stopped in Britain,'' said
Chetty. ''The only people who can get in at all, and then not easily,
are where families are being reunited.
''The major thing about this whole row is that European immigration is
already very, very strict. It's nonsense to say that it is more liberal.
What happens in Europe is that there is very restricting migration for
guest workers who have no rights in Europe. Right across Europe the
experience of black people is that it's very difficult and terribly
restrictive.''
Chetty said it was also important to note that Britain was the only
country in the EC which has any race relations legislation.
''There is no race relations legislation in Europe that protects black
people's rights,'' she said. ''Migrant legislation which exists in
Europe doesn't allow people to put down roots and have democratic rights
like voting. Life is very, very difficult for migrants and black people
in Europe.''
She said the terminology used to describe Wardle's vision of
uncontrolled immigration might foster resentment among some Britons
already feeling the pinch from unemployment and poverty.
She said in the UK there were a plethora of cases which showed the
narrowness of existing immigration rules, including the incident last
year when the parents of a Glasgow businessman were denied leave by the
British High Commission in Pakistan to come to their granddaughter's
wedding.
The Kashmiri couple were to have attended the wedding of their first
grandchild in Renfrew. They were told the immigration officer and consul
in Islamabad did not believe they would return to Pakistan after their
visa had expired. The case caused outrage among Labour MPs.
Speaking yesterday, Labour's Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson, who has
worked with the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Council, said he was
taken aback by Wardle's statements.
''My experience, particularly for people trying to get into Britain
from the sub-continent is that it's still extremely difficult. I have
also had complaints from constituents who are black British citizens
trying to travel to France. They meet all sorts of restrictions which
are not being placed on white British citizens.
''In my experience, restrictions are already severe in terms of people
coming into this country and I am not aware that the other European
Union countries allow non-EU nationals in in significant numbers.''
Tory Euro-sceptic Bill Walker MP, however, said he believed Charles
Wardle's vision was right.
The MP for Tayside North said yesterday that if the UK's ''so-called
opt-out'' was challenged by the European Court of Justice it would
probably be found invalid.
He said he agreed with Wardle's assertion that there could then be
immigration on a huge scale.
''I believe there will be,'' he said. ''There's no way we can stop
people coming from Europe. I think it's nonsense to pretend otherwise.''
Mr Walker added that the illegal immigration position in the UK today
was ''serious''. ''If it gets worse it will become critical,'' he said.
At the Home Office, a spokeswoman said that citizens of the European
Union have free movement within the union but the government was
committed to maintaining border controls for non-EU citizens. ''They
require entry clearance in order to enter the country.''
Asked what the position would be if a non-EU citizen entered a
European community country, was given a resident visa, then tried to
move into the UK, the spokeswoman said: ''That would tend to depend on
the individual circumstances. It's too hypothetical to put in broad
terms.''
She reiterated the Prime Minister's earlier assertions that the
Government had no intention of ''dismantling the frontiers''.
Some European observers, meanwhile, say they are bemused by the row,
because the much-vaunted freedom of movement among EU nationals is not
actually taking place, and the ideal of a frontier-free,
movement-for-all Europe is still some way off.
They say the computer system to get the whole common immigration
system harmonised is still not up and running, and the External
Frontiers Convention is being held up by a row between the UK and Spain
over the inclusion of Gibraltar.
Dr David Fergus, a specialist in European Community law at Glasgow
University, said that in theory all international barriers to freedom of
movement are supposed to be down and people can move across borders.
''That patently is not happening though.''
Dr Fergus said the European community was conceived at a time of
fairly high employment in Europe and the movement of workers was a real
possibility. ''Obviously things have changed over the past 10 or 12
years. Why would you go somewhere if there was no work for you?''
In a similar vein, Mike Watson believes the entire Wardle row is also
an example of the British fondly imagining that they have the best that
Europe has to offer.
''Why should thousands of people try to come to Britain rather than
Germany, France or Holland which have higher standards of living?'' he
said.

TONY BLAIR: The Moderniser
By Jon Sopel
Michael Joseph, #15.99
WHEN Tony Blair returned from holiday last summer, a break which the
newly installed Labour leader had predictably spent contemplating what
on earth he was going to do now, he discussed with a friend the
possibility of reforming Clause 4 of the party membership. The potential
pitfalls were rehearsed for him. ''The party is not worth leading,''
said Blair, ''if it's not leading to government.'' It seemed that he had
already made up his mind.
And that, really, is what the entire political debate within the
Labour Party is now about. There has to be a limit on the years in
opposition which any political party can sustain while continuing to
retain electoral credibility and any sense of purpose. The last 16 years
have already seen off the chances of a ministerial career for an entire
generation of Labour politicians, and there is a growing desperation
among the less glamorous but more faithful ranks of the party infantry.
What could be worse, they argue, than yet another Conservative victory?
And that, of course, is why they picked Tony Blair as leader in the
first place.
So, mostly, they are gritting their teeth and getting on with the
horrid task they have been set by Blair, this leader they chose to lead
them to victory at last, and who then somewhat unexpectedly rewarded
them with a campaign to replace the totem of Clause 4 and introduce
something more relevant, more widely acceptable, more modern.
There are many people who do not like one bit what is happening. Blair
may have underestimated the amount of trouble that he is stacking up for
himself -- even if he does win this one -- but it would be hard to
diminish the determined, gritty will to win that informs what is now
under way in the Labour Party.
Tony Blair is pretty gritty on this subject himself. This much is
amply demonstrated by Jon Sopel, winner here of the race for the first
biography of he who would be the next Prime Minister. The conversation
quoted above, between Blair and his friend and adviser the Labour MP
Peter Mandelson, is itself a measure of that. The importance of it is
illustrated by the fact that although the two men obviously meet and
talk with great frequency, Mandelson felt it appropriate to take a note
and keep a record of their discussion in this case.
Sopel's book has a fair amount of decent original material of this
kind -- enough, anyway, to make it a very respectable effort. There is a
wealth of previously unknown detail about Tony Blair. It is a book which
will be of value to anyone, including members of the Labour Party, who
want to understand their leader a little bit better.
There are problems here. The most obvious is that it is quite
difficult to write a decent book about someone who hasn't actually done
anything yet. That is not to underestimate the achievement of a
successful lawyer who gets first elected to Parliament and then elected
as his own party leader within 11 years. But Tony Blair would be the
first to admit that he is untried. He himself was questioned about the
fact that he had left out of his entry in Who's Who the various
front-bench jobs he has held. ''Well, they're not real jobs, are they?''
he said.
The book is chronological. We follow the ambitious, slightly bolshie,
child through school where he was miserably unhappy at Fettes, railing
against the fagging system. He apparently now jokes that his opposition
to this and petty rules that strangled individualism were his first act
as a modernising politician.
Blair is reported to be irritated by the repeated suggestions that he
had a privileged childhood. While acknowledging that the family was
never poor or hungry, it was tried by the illness of his father and his
sister. There is, however, a naivety about his reported reactions here,
which one finds, too, in his expressed surprise about the hostility he
has engendered by sending his eldest child to a grant-maintained school.
It rather suggests a man who does not truly understand the party he
leads. He has been helped along the way by those who do: notably Gordon
Brown, the Man Most Likely To for so many years and then, suddenly, with
a terrible swiftness, the Also Ran who didn't even run. For it was Brown
who helped and guided Blair, taught him to understand the Labour Party a
little better than he previously had, and, after standing down in
Blair's favour in the leadership election, helped him to write his
memorable acceptance speech and then said, simply, but with a wry grin,
as Blair walked past him having made it: ''Nice speech''.
Brown emerges in the book as a man who knows and understands the
Labour Party in a way that Blair perhaps still doesn't and maybe never
will. In a way, however, one begins to wonder whether that is in any
case irrelevant to Tony Blair's ambition.
''The project'' about which he and his advisers talk is not just about
winning the next election, about power, about agenda-setting, or
winning-hearts-and-minds, or any other cliches; it is about redefining
the nature of British politics. It has very little to do with
understanding the Labour Party and everything to do with winning the
next election. But what will happen then? We will have to wait and find
out.

Washington, Sunday
ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation pledged today to
''negotiate promptly'' an accord on Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank and Palestinian elections, US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said.
He said in a statement the commitment was made by Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres and senior PLO official Nabil Shaath on the
fringes of an Arab-Israeli foreign ministers' meeting in Washington.
The statement, agreed after a meeting this morning between
Christopher, Peres and Shaath, said Israel and the PLO expressed
determination to work for a successful meeting later this week between
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
A meeting on Thursday between Rabin and Arafat failed to overcome
differences over Islamic guerrilla attacks on Israel and Israel's
closure of its border with Gaza and the West Bank. The differences are
holding up agreement on a troop redeployment and elections.
Foreign ministers of the United States, Israel, Egypt and Jordan and
Shaath pledged there would be no turning back in the Middle East peace
process.--Reuter.

SOOTY and Sweep have fallen foul of watchdogs for plugging their
products on their TV show.
The glove puppets were censured for allowing their commercial videos
to be clearly visible in the background of Sooty and Co.
Only one viewer complained but the Independent Television Commission
was called in to investigate the Granada TV show.
The ITC's monthly report today states: ''The videos were in breach of
the programme code about undue prominence for commercial products.
However, Sooty was spared further blushes after Granada agreed to
introduce tighter scrutiny.
''In these circumstances, the ITC concluded that it would not be
appropriate to consider any additional sanction in respect of the Sooty
programme,'' the report adds.
The ITC, created by the 1990 Broadcasting Act to regulate and license
commercial television in Britain, received 336 complaints during
January.
Football pundit Ron Atkinson caused a stir when he made an ''Irish
joke'' about stretcher bearers.
Eight viewers objected and ITV companies received other complaints
about the remark made on Champions League -- Live!
Motorcyclists were upset when Police, Camera, Action wrongly said it
was illegal for a motor cycle to tow a trailer -- 27 complaints were
upheld and a correction was screened, although Carlton TV pointed out
the law was vague.

A BLUEPRINT for the future development of the Grampian area will be
submitted by the regional council to the Scottish Secretary today, more
than two-and-a-half years late.
The Grampian Structure Plan follows a long public consultation which
involved 43 meetings attended by 2000 people and the consideration of
almost 700 letters.
Now, a further six-week consultation period will start, to allow
anyone to make their views known to the Scottish Secretary.
The biggest controversy surrounded the areas identified for the 11,000
new houses expected to be required over the next 12 years, and it has
been estimated that the delay has put around #10,000 on the price of an
average three-bedroomed semi-detached house in the Aberdeen housing
area.
The region's own officials and independent consultants backed the
creation of a new settlement to the south-west of the city (for which
there was a #500m proposal from the Stewart Milne Group) but the council
rejected that advice and eventually settled on a dispersal policy.
The regional council says the structure plan moves towards sustainable
development in the North-east and, in looking forward to the year 2006,
it embraces a ''think global: act local'' philosophy to ensure that
actions taken today do not deprive future generations of their
birthright.
''The strategy is to protect the environment while promoting the
economy, especially of rural Grampian,'' the council says.
''This is reflected in, for example, the approach to transportation,
which offers improved accessibility through a balance of public
transport and by-pass schemes.''
Councillor James Davidson, chairman of the council's economic
development and planning committee, said: ''The Grampian Structure Plan
has been some time in preparation because it is such an important
matter.
''The regional council has been wholly committed to public involvement
in the process. I hope this commitment will be reflected in supportive
comments to the Secretary of State for Scotland.''
Dr Howard Fisher, the director of economic development and planning,
said: ''I cannot pretend that the preparation and subsequent discussion
of the plan has been an easy process but it has certainly been
worthwhile.
''Sustainability is not just a new buzz word, it's essential to good
forward planning. Grampian's future is bright and an up-to-date
structure plan will be critical in delivering that future.''
Mr Lang expects to approve the plan, with or without modifications,
within a year.

At least five of his colleagues are
lining up behind veteran Ulster
Unionist leader James Molyneaux.
But, as Russell Edmonds explains,
they may be motivated more
by leadership ambitions than loyalty
BEHIND the struggle to keep Northern Ireland's peace process on the
rails, another political battle is hotting up. In both cases, it could
be said that James Molyneaux, now in his 75th year, is a key player.
On the plane from London to Belfast, he looks a somewhat insignificant
figure, his head buried in a gardening magazine as it was one evening
last week. Molyneaux is probably the most low-profile political leader
in the UK, a man who shirks media attention and is noted for his reserve
and simple tastes.
But without his support, Prime Minister John Major might not survive
and the Northern Ireland peace process could falter. Wielding such
apparent power as he does so quietly, it should come as no surprise that
several of Molyneaux's lieutenants now appear increasingly envious of
his role and restless to take over from him.
The next few weeks are likely to be the most important of his
political career as the British and Irish governments prepare to launch
their framework document with its controversial plans for new
all-Ireland institutions.
As if that were not enough, the Ulster Unionist leader faces a
personal challenge. While no-one openly opposes him, the prospects of
change at the top of the Unionist Party now looms large. Even before the
recent controversy surrounding leaks to the Times newspaper on the plans
for Ulster, Molyneaux's future was in question.
Though he has said nothing publicly, his fellow MPs at Westminster
have become convinced that he would stand down from office sometime in
1995, thus ending a political reign as leader which began in 1979. Now,
as the deadline for the British-Irish proposals nears, the pressures
grow on Molyneaux and on those who are now vying to take his place.
The prize for them is the leadership of a party which holds the
balance of power at Westminster and, thus, may determine whether the
Conservative Government remains in office for its full term. More
parochially, the Ulster Unionist Party has by far the largest support in
Northern Ireland and, without its backing, it seems no future settlement
in Ireland can be obtained.
Furthermore, if a new settlement is agreed, power will move from
London to Belfast where a Northern Ireland Assembly will be established,
in which the Unionists would be the largest block, and probably provide
the leader.
Not since the 1920s have the stakes been so high in Ireland with a
focus of attention that stretches from London, Dublin and Brussels to
the White House, where President Clinton is preparing to host a special
conference on Ulster later this year.
Molyneaux has been unassailable until recently when it emerged that
his influential relationship with John Major was turning cold. The
Unionist leader, who is a Privy Counsellor, had enjoyed the ear of Mr
Major over the past two years and, particularly, during the period when
the British Prime Minister and his Irish counterpart, Albert Reynolds,
produced the Downing Street peace declaration in December 1993.
At home in Ulster, Molyneaux's supporters believed his influence was
such that no deal could be struck between London and Dublin without his
backing. But the leaks have suggested otherwise, and Molyneaux himself
admits that he has been somewhat cold-shouldered by Downing Street in
recent weeks.
If that is the case then the ageing leader's demise could well be
hastened. He faces re-election at the annual meeting of the Ulster
Unionists' Council on March 18 and, though this is a formality, the
prospect of him deciding to bow out gracefully or of a stalking-horse
candidate emerging to challenge him cannot be ruled out.
Whatever happens, other MPs in his party are already queuing up to
take over, quietly jousting for pole position in the expectation that
this will be his last year in office.
At least five of the nine-strong Ulster Unionist group at Westminster
could be in the running. They range from the dour rural character of
William Ross, the party's chief whip, to the more outspoken John Taylor,
who still bears the facial scars from being shot by an IRA attacker in
1972 when he was a minister in the Stormont government at that time.
The leader of the Orange Order, the Rev Martin Smyth, says he will
stand if and when Molyneaux steps down, while other strong candidates
include Ken Maginnis, the party's spokesman on security, and David
Trimble, a former university law lecturer who has made a name as an
articulate performer on television.
All are Members of Parliament and, while it is not beyond the bounds
of possibility that the party could choose someone from outside
Westminster, this seems very impractical given that the political power
base remains in London, for the moment anyway.
Since none of the candidates has openly declared himself, it is
difficult to pick a favourite, but the front-runners at the moment
appear to be William Ross and John Taylor.
Ross has just celebrated his 59th birthday, he owns a farm at
Dungiven, County Londonderry, and has been an MP for the area since
1974. He appears, like Molyneaux, to be a man of few public words,
unimpressive with the media but very active behind the scenes.
Unlike some of the other candidates, he does not deviate from the
mainstream party line but was among the most sceptical about the Downing
Street peace deal and a regular critic of the Irish Government's
involvement in Northern Ireland.
In 1988 he opposed power sharing, claiming it would give Nationalists
a built-in veto, and is on record as saying that Dublin could never have
a say in the government of Northern Ireland.
John Taylor, aged 57, is the party's most high-profile MP. He has been
in Ulster politics since his university days and was the youngest
Unionist to be elected to the old Stormont Parliament. Unlike Ross, he's
rarely out of the news of the local television screens, his speeches
often addressing controversial issues and, sometimes, drawing
considerable anger from Nationalists.
In 1972 the official IRA tried to assassinate him in his home town of
Armagh. He was seriously wounded in the face and chest and had to
undergo extensive surgery, but that has not deterred him from following
a political career. At one point he angered the Irish authorities by
claiming that Loyalist violence would eventually reach Dublin, and he
has also said that, in the event of a united Ireland, he anticipates an
exodus of Protestants.
Recently Taylor said that anyone considering challenging Molyneaux
should be ''politically knee-capped'' but he is clearly one of the
leading contenders when the leader resigns.
Of the others, David Trimble is seen as a tough Unionist advocate but
may not be long enough in the party to win the top role this time. He
qualified as a barrister and later became a senior lecturer in law and
Dean of the Faculty at Queen's University in Belfast, before becoming MP
for Upper Bann in 1990.
Aged 50, Trimble has been heavily critical of the Irish Government's
links with the peace process and their attempts to persuade the IRA with
what he sees as unacceptable political concessions. He is on record as
saying that it was wrong to be ''publicly negotiating with terrorists''.
Ken Maginnis, 56, the MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, is a former
teacher and speaks on security matters for the Ulster Unionists. The
Enniskillen Remembrance Day bombing took place in his constituency and
he is noted for his strong opposition to terrorism.
He was critical of President Clinton's decision to issue a visa to the
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and appeared on television in the US in a
debate with Adams. He has been demanding that the IRA hand over its
weapons before Sinn Fein can be involved in political talks.
Finally, the Rev Martin Smyth, Grand Master of the Orange Order in
Ireland, was originally a Presbyterian minister. He resigned his church
ministry to become MP for South Belfast in 1982 in a by-election caused
by the assassination of the Rev Robert Bradford.
Smyth would have enormous support from within the Orange Order, which
he leads during the summer months in a number of major parades and
demonstrations. However, the Unionist Party is attempting to shed any
sectarian image and it may be that the appointment of such a
high-profile Orange leader would not be acceptable in some quarters.
Aged 64, Smyth is seen as another traditionalist, a factor in his
favour among the grassroots Unionists who will be called on to choose a
new leader.
At the moment Ross appears the favourite even if the prospect of
having him as leader finds little enthusiasm in either Dublin or London.
But whoever is chosen is hardly likely to deviate from the position
adopted by Molyneaux over so many years.
From the speeches and profiles of the main contenders for his job, it
is evident that none of them is likely to break the solid political
mould of Ulster Unionism, which James Molyneaux has set firmly since
1979.

EDUCATION policy should not be driven by the whims of accountants or
market forces, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland told an audience of academics in Aberdeen yesterday.
The Rt Rev Dr James Simpson was speaking at the Founder's Day sermon
at a ceremony to mark the 500th anniversary of Aberdeen University.
He said: ''When accountants and economists often have more power to
determine what happens in universities than principals or professors, I
hope this university and the other Scottish universities will go on
resisting the pressure to justify everything that is taught and done
here solely by the standard of market values.''
The massive expansion of universities over the past decade, with
thousands more students being taught by fewer and fewer lecturers, has
resulted in a consequent decrease in the quality and depth of the
educational experience for many, he warned.
This meant that staff had less time to meet and debate with colleagues
or their students, which has a negative effect on the quality of their
research.
''The resultant loss is considerable, for it is through sharing ideas
and the clash of thought that understanding is enlarged, scrutinised,
and modified,'' Dr Simpson said.
One of the problems of the market force-dominated approach to
education, Dr Simpson said, was that it was attuned only to the bare
statistics of increasing the number of graduates, and did not consider
the often more important role of education in helping young people
develop into responsible members of society.
Ignoring this responsibility means that our universities can be
turning out extremely well qualified individuals -- ''walking
encyclopaedias'' with a string of degrees -- who appear ''to act and
talk like fools''.
''It takes more than knowledge and skills to make people wise,'' Dr
Simpson said. His concern was that universities were being forced to
ditch moral education, in favour of a conveyor-belt, soulless approach,
making them little more than degree-factories, in ''a culture of
contempt'' where market forces dominate virtually every sphere of life.
Education should be a process of equipping students to make a life for
themselves that was ''satisfying and worthwhile'', with the highest
ambition not the pursuit of money and an affluent lifestyle but the
enrichment of all of ''the great human family'', with the ultimate aim
greater justice for all.
The moderator's implicit attack on the Government's education policy
came just days after university chiefs warned that more funding would
have to be provided if the proposed expansion of the number of
university students were to be achieved without adversely affecting the
quality of education on offer.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals also criticised the
Government's emphasis on competition and assessing performance in terms
of bald statistics.
The Government and the universities have set a target to get 40% of
school-leavers going on to further education by the end of the decade.
At present, 30% go on to higher education, although the proportion is
higher in Scotland.

Meanwhile, Labour's Scottish employment spokesman claimed that his
party's plans to introduce a national minimum wage would not lead to job
losses, writes CAMERON SIMPSON.
Mr John McFall told a seminar on employment rights in Glasgow that
there was no credible research to substantiate the wild claims by
Government Ministers that a minimum wage would lead to job losses.
He said: ''The wide variations in the claims about possible job losses
by senior Tories shows that they don't know what they are talking about.
''Norman Tebbit estimates that a minimum wage would cost 60,000 jobs,
while David Hunt goes over the top, claiming that it could be more than
two million. Anyone who takes a hard look at the facts and the research
that has been done can only conclude that the Tory arguments are
entirely bogus.''
Mr McFall said a recent US study of 440 fast-food outlets in New
Jersey had shown that after the national minimum wage had gone up there
had been a net increase in employment, due in part to the resulting
extra spending power.
Despite a dramatic slump in wage levels in the hotel and catering
trade in the UK following abolition of the Wages Council in 1993, about
27,000 jobs had been lost in that sector.
Mr McFall told the seminar that a minimum national wage was necessary
to ensure an end to poverty in work and to prevent unscrupulous
employers from exploiting a vulnerable workforce.
In industries such as hairdressing, hotel and catering, retail, and
the leisure industries, at least 25% of the workers were being paid less
than they would have been if the wages councils had still been in
operation.
In the hotel and catering trade, 66% are being paid less than they
would otherwise have been if wages councils had still been on the go.
In all, 31% of the UK workforce -- around 840,000 people -- are in
what is considered to be low-paid work.
Mr McFall went on: ''It is clear that many employers in these sectors
simply aren't uprating their pay levels from one year to the next. It is
a staggering fact that 40.9% of families on family credit were within
the wage council orbit.''
Mr McFall also told the seminar that the Tories were at their most
callous when dealing with young people. The cumulative effect of the
abolition of minimum wage protection for the under-21s, the lower level
of income support for younger people, and the withdrawal of income
support for 16 and 17-year-olds, had been a drop in average income since
1979 for those under 20 of #34 a week.
* The Government's insistence that its policies have increased the
number of jobs was attacked as ''misleading and inaccurate'' in a new
report from the TUC yesterday.

SIGNS that the troubled Loch Lomond steamer Maid of the Loch faces
another financial storm emerged yesterday.
Dumbarton District Council is this week due to establish a trust fund
in an effort to save the Maid, which has been tied up at Balloch pier
for 14 years.
However, a report issued by Mr Michael Watters, district secretary,
the council's chief executive, indicates a reluctance on the part of the
local authority to transfer the ship to the trust immediately.
It is also reluctant to hand over the pier and a parcel of valuable
land, which were purchased along with the Maid and her sister ship, the
Countess Fiona.
''It has been proposed that the ownership of the Maid will not be
transferred until the trust has been successful in attracting the
critical mass funding which will indicate the likely success of the
trust and its purposes,'' Mr Watters says.
However, the council indicates it may be willing to lease it to the
Paddle Steamer Preservation Society, which has already kitted out the
Maid in its livery.
The society feels that without the immediate transfer of ownership
''the trust's ability to attract funding will be severely prejudiced''.
Its members want the steamer handed over as soon as the trust is
established, with the condition that should it fail to attract the
necessary cash to save it within six months to a year then the ownership
will revert to the council.
Mr Watters says he is attempting to clarify the position before the
council meets to appoint the five members of the trust on Thursday.
They are likely to be Provost Patrick O'Neill and two council
officials, Mr Michael Hugan, of the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society,
and Councillor Billy Petrie, chairman of Argyll, Loch Lomond, Stirling,
and Trossachs Tourist Board.
It will be their job to set up operating companies to restore the Maid
to one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions.
However, Mr Watters says only #75,000 has been suggested as the
council's initial contribution, although the feasibility study assumed
they would give three times that amount.
The same report also stated it would cost more than #1m to get the
steamer sailing.
Mr Watters -- says he will be contacting Dunbartonshire Enterprise to
clarify their commitment.
His report follows rumblings that enthusiasm to save the Maid is
waning.
Mr Donald MacInnes, chief executive of Dunbartonshire Enterprise, says
that although they are currently looking for a ''flagship project'' for
tourism on Loch Lomondside, the Maid may not be it.
The LEC has come under pressure from cruise operators to abandon the
Maid project because they believe it will scuttle their business.

<HEADLINE>Union attacks Peterken plan to axe 500 jobs</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRISTOPHER REEKIE</BYLINE>

AN ACCUSATION of ''ideological vandalism'' was yesterday levelled at
Mr Laurence Peterken, the dismissed general manager of Greater Glasgow
Health Board, over his recommendation that more than 500 jobs should be
axed in two divisions of the Common Services Agency.
It came from Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer with Unison, the
public service union.
Mr Peterken, now director of special projects of the CSA, where he is
carrying out a review of its services, has suggested in an internal
document that the two divisions be closed.
These control payments for dental treatment and prescription charges
and monitor the quality of services provided by dentists and pharmacists
in Scotland for the NHS.
Shutting them would mean 520 job losses in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and
Aberdeen.
Mr Devine said the union was appalled by the proposal, which showed
there was a piecemeal attack on the CSA and ''step-by-step
asset-stripping''.
Referring to 200 jobs already lost since Mr Peterken began his review
in November, 1993, Mr Devine said nearly 40% of the staff in CSA had
been made redundant, and that keeping these jobs would save taxpayers in
Scotland #26m a year.
Mr Devine yesterday took part in a meeting in Edinburgh between Unison
and the CSA about an earlier proposal by Mr Peterken to earmark 37 jobs
for redundancy in its supplies division. It was adjourned until
Thursday.
Mr Matt Smith, Scottish secretary of Unison, said yesterday that Mr
Peterken had caused nothing but problems for employees.
However, an internal management memorandum in CSA has expressed doubt
about Mr Peterken's latest proposal.
It suggests that an alternative would be to review procedures and try
to identify where savings could be made, and that this would be
preferable to the division disappearing and its functions being
performed elsewhere in the UK.
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday that Mr Peterken's report
was an internal document and he could not comment on its contents.
The recommendations were only suggestions and would not necessarily be
acted upon. The final decision would be taken by the CSA board.
Mr Peterken was appointed to his post in the health service within a
fortnight of being sacked from the health board.
His departure followed a serious of bitter exchanges with Mr Bill
Fyfe, chairman of GGHB. Mr Fyfe was in turn forced to resign after a
political row over the way he had handled Mr Peterken's dismissal.

A NUCLEAR reactor at Hunterston Power Station, Ayrshire, was twice
shut down after on-load refuelling, ScottishPower has reported. The two
incidents within 24 hours last month both led to automatic shutdown of
Reactor 3.
The first incident, on January 9, happened as power was being
increased after six channels had been refuelled. A control rod fault
triggered a shutdown. The next day, the main boiler feed pump developed
a fault as the reactor was again being powered up, and the automatic
shutdown system came into operation.

William Russell talks to Ted Short who says Tony Blair need look no
further than the filing cabinet for a Scottish Assembly scheme
TONY BLAIR should appoint a Cabinet minister from the Commons, not
necessarily a Scot, whose sole job would be to get the Devolution Bill
through Parliament, acording to Lord Glenamara, who, as Ted Short was
the architect of the Wilson Government's Devolution Bill.
He retired from the Commons in 1976, when Wilson resigned as Prime
Minister. He was succeeded as Lord President by Michael Foot.
John Smith, then a Minister of State, was Foot's No 2, and did the
remaining detailed work on the legislation. Lord Glenamara does not
believe a similar arrangement would work again. He is also sceptical
about Labour's none-too-specific plans for the English regions.
Things have changed since 1974 when, despite a commitment, Labour had
no idea what it was going to do. ''I started from scratch,'' he said.
''Harold Wilson called me in one day and said he would like me to take
charge. I asked where had we got to? We had got nowhere. No work had
been done.
''I agreed with Wilson that the Government would start from the
position that we would be as generous as possible. We were clear what we
meant. We would devolve certain powers of central government to a
regional government, which is quite different from handing over
sovereignty. In the case of devolution you can always take back or
modify. The example is Stormont.
''We decided in the case of Scotland, as it was already making its own
laws at Westminster and had it own legal system, that clearly the right
thing to do was to devolve power to make laws. In the case of Wales it
was to be executive devolution.''
He added: ''It was a massive operation. The whole field of Government
had to be reviewed and the consequences considered. In my time in
Government I have never known any operation to be more carefully
supervised.''
He said that a Blair Government would have the legislation he and
Michael Foot worked on as a basis from which to start, which meant it
would be in a better state than Labour was in 1974.
On the vexed West Lothian Question, which is bound to be raised once
again, he suggested one look at the Stormont example. ''Did you ever
remember anyone saying that the Irish MPs should not vote on English
matters here? It worked in that case and there is no reason why it
should not work in the case of Scotland.''
Should Scotland's number of Westminster MPs be reduced? ''I don't
think so,'' he said. ''Scotland's population is so dispersed you need
that number.''
He pointed out that English MPs voted on Scottish matters as it was,
and it would be possible to ensure that purely English legislation went
to committees on which only English MPs sat for their detailed
examination.
''Devolution works perfectly well in Germany, in Australia and New
Zealand and Canada,'' he added. ''We can look at their experience. We
did. I don't think devolution will lead to the break up of the United
Kingdom.''
His advice to those who will be following the path he went down in
1974-76 is to know their stuff. ''It will be difficult and take a long
time to get through the Commons. I don't know about the Lords.''
He said that he and the Labour Party diverged over the issue of the
North of England whose MPs last time round played such a major part in
impeding the devolution process. It was largely because of that response
the party had gone for a system of local government in England, he said.
He did not think there was any need for regional bodies in England.
Nor was there any demand for them, except from politicians. ''I
recommend anyone who gets the devolution job to resist other jobs. It
should be a full-time task for one minister.
''When the devolved Parliament meets in Edinburgh I will be there,''
he added. ''I feel the Scottish identity should be given a dimension of
its own through a devolved government. I am sure it will work well,
strengthen the United Kingdom, and not be divisive.''

John Linklater argues that 50 years after the devastation of Dresden,
Britain should end the long deception and admit that the city's
destruction was more a show of power than a strategic imperative.
DRESDEN must be seen as a demonstration of the destructive
capabilities of the Western Allies in anticipation of the Cold War.
Until this political motive is addressed and understood, the levelling
of Dresden 50 years ago today remains an even more senseless act.
Attempts to justify the operation in terms of strategic necessity, aimed
at accelerating victory in the Second World War, are obdurately naive
and a lasting insult.
Historians are at least agreed that there was a conspicuous failure to
meet the ostensible objectives of successive waves of attack by Bomber
Command and the US 8th Air Force. Dresden's main bridges remained
standing, trains resumed running within a couple of days and priority
was given to clearing streets of moonscape rubble. The first pictures of
the disaster area show how quickly this was achieved.
Troop concentrations, if they existed at all, were composed of
children and veterans. I met a Dresden survivor last week who told me
that at the time of the bombings his father, aged 60, had been drafted
into air defences in another part of Saxony. The criminal liquidation of
thousands of innocent refugees (the highest element of the death toll)
cannot be dignified with any discussion of strategic objectives. The
objective of sowing confusion implies that a city which had taken in
refugees to double its population to more than one million was not
already in a state of considerable disarray. This is patent nonsense.
The Press Association reported within days that Dresden was the start
of a new campaign of ''terror bombing'' designed to break the morale of
the German people, and it caused tremendous political embarrassment when
it escaped the American censor. It was suppressed in Britain, where
questions in the House of Commons and public criticism made Dresden a
delicate issue from the outset.
Suggesting the German civil population needed Dresden to awaken to
''terror'', when the British and American armies were at the Rhine and
the Soviets at the Oder, when every industrial city had received five
years of sustained pummeling, is analogous to speculation that the
war-scarred populations of Coventry and Clydebank would have collapsed
and surrendered with the subsequent news that Stratford-upon-Avon had
been fire-bombed. Such an ineptitude would have produced incredulity,
indignation and a stiffening of resolve. Dresden had that effect. Berlin
would be fought for street by street.
It also lost the Allies the moral ascendancy in a fight to crush an
evil, offering a permanent excuse for the kind of resentment and
national humiliation that had started the war in the first place. The
Neo-Nazi threat to today's memorial in Dresden is a case in point, and
it is four years since the Neo-Nazis had any kind of profile in Dresden.
It is exploiting an opportunity created by Britain's continuing
inability to express regret. The RAF have boycotted today's ceremonies,
refusing to contribute to reconciliation.
Churchill's memorandum of March 28, 1945, when he called for a review
of the policy of bombing German cities, ''simply for the sake of
increasing terror, though under other pretexts'', is generally presented
as a betrayal of Bomber Command. Its commander-in-chief, Arthur Harris,
responded typically the next day that any psychiatrist could explain
sensitivity over Dresen: ''It is connected with German bands and Dresden
shepherdesses . . . I do not personally regard the whole of the
remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British
Grenadier.'' In the face of such an embarrassing display of
vindictiveness, Churchill's missive can be taken as a belated
confession, although it still fails to tell the whole truth.
Dresden was intended to make an impression, that much is clear. It was
one of the deepest strikes made on a European city during the course of
the war. The co-ordination of British and American bombers, in waves of
nightime and daytime strikes from February 13-15, was a rare occasion in
the war when co-operation between Bomber Command and the US Air force
actually materialised.
The elaborate decoys and dummy runs planned into the attacks were
exhibitionist and out of all proportion to the level of air defence with
which Germany was capable of resisting in February 1945. Dresden was a
virgin target, so the extent of the devastation from a single operation
could be measured all the more awesomely. As an opportunity to kill a
lot of people refugee-saturated Dresden was an optimum. As a spectacle
of conflagration, it had been learned through experience that old cities
ignite most readily.
The question is, for whose education was such a stupefying prodigy of
destruction intended? On the first two days alone, 1084 British and
American planes dropped 3371 tons of bombs and incendiaries to create a
firestorm. There is a kind of mentality that will find such statistics
impressive. Stalin had asked for support on the Eastern Front. Now he
got a demonstration, and a salutary lesson. Dresden was all about giving
Stalin food for thought.
It is reported that only a week before, at the Yalta Conference,
American and British chiefs of staff were chagrined by Stalin's apparent
ignorance of the damage done to Germany and Japan by strategic bombing.
Hollywood pictures and combat footage were apparently screened to make a
point that Dresden would graphically reinforce when the Soviet Red Army
moved on another 50 miles to take the city.
More significantly, it was at Yalta that the lines for the impending
Cold War were drawn up as Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin divided the
map of East and West Europe. Dresden came precisely two days after the
conference broke up. Churchill had initiated plans for the attack in
late January.
The ''pretext'', to repeat Churchill's own word a month later, was to
support the advance of the Soviet Red Army. The hidden political
objective was intimidation, of Stalin more than the defeated German
people. If Germany was not effectively defeated, as the defenders of the
Dresden operation claim, then why did the Yalta Conference concern
itself with such issues as minimum subsistence for German civilians,
dismantling of German armaments production, reparations out of the
German people's post-war earnings and the setting up of international
courts for trials of war criminals?
Dresden was a British and American war crime because thousands of
innocent lives and a beautiful city were sacrificed to teach a salutary
lesson to the Soviets. Only the generous would ascribe deterrence value
in the coming Cold War, a demonstration of conventional warfare taken to
the extreme. It was part of an escalation of destruction the human
imagination would sanction, a preparatory to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and
their sickening illustration of nuclear capability.
Dresden belongs to a New Europe. The politics that wasted that city
are an ugly anachronism, and it is time that Britain stopped lying about
its shameful role in a 50-year deception, justified by cant and
hypocrisy.

Health and poverty in Glasgow come under the spotlight tonight when
the BBC's Panorama programme examines increasing death rates among the
poor in Britain.
Dr Harry Burns, director of public health for Greater Glasgow Health
Board, explains why the problems must be faced and why he believes
Government policies are making matters worse.
DIRECTORS of public health are not employed to win popularity
contests. If the health of the population is not as good as it should be
then it is our job to ask awkward questions. We poke around in the
system, often making people feel threatened and uncomfortable. In many
respects we are similar to -- and as popular as -- policemen and
journalists. The participation of Glasgow public health doctors in
tonight's Panorama may make us even more unpopular. By discussing
Glasgow's depressing health statistics with London-based journalists,
Glasgow's imagemakers will see us as causing damage.
In attributing the cause of ill health to poverty, Government will see
us as being critical of policies which do not concern us. Too bad. My
job description says I am employed to ''determine and interpret the
health status of the population and the factors which have a bearing on
it''. So here are some determinations and interpretations.
Young people living in poor areas of Glasgow are two-and-a-half times
more likely to die before the age of 65 as those living in affluent
areas. If you live in Drumchapel or Easterhouse or Pollok you are twice
as likely to have a stroke or a heart attack as someone living in
Bearsden or Newton Mearns. You are three times as likely to develop lung
cancer. A new-born baby leaving hospital today to go home to Drumchapel
might expect to die around seven to 10 years sooner than the baby in the
next cot who is going home to Bearsden.
The stark facts of Glasgow's burden of ill health and its relation to
poverty is well known. However, poverty influences health in more
pervasive ways which are less widely appreciated. More than half of all
women who live in an affluent area and develop breast cancer will
survive.
Despite receiving identical treatment, more than half of all women
with breast cancer living in poor areas will die. If you live in a poor
area and require a bowel operation, your chances of developing
complications and dying after the operation are at least 50% higher than
if you lived in an affluent area. If you develop angina you are less
likely to be referred for a heart operation. You are three times as
likely to be admitted to hospital with a broken leg and four times as
likely to be admitted with a psychiatric illness. The incidence of
disease is greater and ability to benefit from treatment is less among
the poor.
Similar differences in health status have been described in England,
Canada, the United States and in most European countries. The only
feature peculiar to Glasgow is the extreme nature of the inequality. The
relationship between poverty and ill health is striking and consistent
for most major causes of death and in most societies.
Furthermore, it has been known about for many years. So, why the fuss
now? Are not the poor always with us? In all societies some are better
off than others. If some people are feckless and smoke, eat unhealthy
food and drink to excess, what can be done about it? Well, quite a lot,
actually.
People differ in their understanding of the extent to which they can
control their own health. A well-paid professional, used to taking
significant decisions in his daily life, is more likely to believe he
has the ability to influence his own health. An unemployed labourer with
no prospects of ever improving the material well-being of his family and
having to live on handouts believes himself to be at the mercy of
external forces.
Sociologists call this ''having an external locus of control''. He is
less likely to give up smoking because he does not see the point. There
is little he can do to influence his life. This effect was illustrated
during recent broadcasts to commemorate the liberation of Auschwitz. One
survivor said: ''We brushed our teeth, even when the brush had no
bristles. We combed our hair even when the comb had no teeth. We would
not let them take away our dignity.'' That gentleman's survival may have
been helped by a strong internal locus of control.
A society which wishes to generate health has to develop this sense of
control and self-reliance within its members. If we consign families to
live in inadequate housing, fail to educate and train them and give them
no hope of ever having meaningful employment we will also burden them
with ill health.
Poverty undermines one's sense of control. Lack of control over one's
own life leads to stress. Stress causes a wide range of physical
illnesses. The association between poverty and physical ill health can
be explained by sound science. However, in affluent countries it is not
the absolute but the relative level of income which determines health.
For example, per capita income in the United States is higher than that
of Sweden yet life expectancy is greater in Sweden where income is more
evenly distributed. In the 1960s and 70s the share of total wealth which
Japanese society paid to the poor increased at a faster rate than in any
other developed country. In the course of those two decades, average
Japanese life expectancy increased by about seven years.
Countries which have sought to distribute income evenly across society
through taxation policies have a higher life expectancy than those which
have not. Available research leads one to conclude that profound
improvements in health across all sections of society can be achieved by
narrowing inequalities in income. Yet the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
have just issued a report confirming that the opposite is happening in
Britain.
A universally acceptable way of increasing disposable income in
Glasgow's deprived areas must be the provision of jobs. When peripheral
housing schemes were built in the 1950s it was assumed that employment
would still be available in traditional heavy industries. As shipyards,
engineering and manufacturing industries in Glasgow have died, attempts
to replace those jobs have not been nearly successful enough.
There appears to be a view in Scottish Enterprise that cities are for
service jobs. Manufacturing is done outside cities in the new towns.
Between 1981 and 1991 Glasgow lost 40% of its manufacturing jobs while
increasing its service sector by around 2%. East Kilbride increased its
manufacturing workforce by 20% and its service jobs by over 40%.
Manufacturing jobs drag service jobs with them so Glasgow faces a double
whammy.
There is rather a different view in Cardiff. Major Japanese electrical
companies have been persuaded to build factories in the city. It is
noticeable that inward investment in Scotland always seems to end up in
new towns.
The Scottish Office document on urban regeneration areas -- Progress
in Partnership -- is interesting. It advocates that ''the main route to
increased employment is to improve links to economic development outwith
regeneration areas, and the creation of employment within the areas is a
secondary objective.'' But Glasgow has the lowest level of car ownership
of any local authority in Britain and have you ever tried to get a bus
from Easterhouse to Livingston?
Unless policy is changed to ensure that jobs are created in places
accessible to the unemployed, the cycle of poverty, stress and ill
health will not be broken in this city. People will leave or die.
Planners and policy makers seem wedded to economic theory which, I
believe, is destroying lives.
Recently there have been calls for an independent inquiry into
Glasgow's health. It would show that the health service deals
effectively with the avalanche of illness confronting it. An inquiry
would also show how policy makers -- of all political shades -- have
failed to understand the destructive effects that flawed education,
employment, transport and housing policies have on health. Reminding
policy makers and politicians of all parties of the human consequences
of their policies will not make me popular. But then, winning popularity
contests is not in my job description.

BRITAIN'S social cohesion is under threat, Labour warned yesterday
after a leaked Civil Service report blamed Government policies for the
growth of an urban underclass.
The paper, which has been circulated in Whitehall, highlights fears
that ''islands'' of poverty, social division, and alienation are being
created, according to a Sunday newspaper.
The document was drawn up following a meeting of eight departmental
permanent secretaries summoned by Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler to
raise awareness of social problems.
It comes after the Government last week rejected claims of widening
inequality made in a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
The paper states: ''It was clearly not arguable that the number of
poor people were increasing, even if it was not certain that, in
absolute terms, the poor were getting poorer.''
The most worrying element was long-term unemployment.
The paper said there had been frequent ''trade-offs'' between policies
aimed at widening choice in health care, education, and housing and
policies aimed at helping the most deprived.
Generally, the policies to increase choice worked to the benefit of
the better-off who were best placed to take advantage of them.
Among the policies highlighted by the report as contributing to the
problems was the distribution of cash incentives to encourage better-off
tenants to leave poorer council estates which was creating inner city
ghettos.
Bus deregulation was blamed for leading to the withdrawal of services
from poorer areas, making it more difficult for people there to travel
to work.
The paper also said education policies discouraged schools from
targeting disaffected pupils for special help, while the growth of
housing benefits following the reduced subsidy of rents for ''social
housing'' was leading to an increase in benefit dependency.
The reduction in value of the married couple's allowance and enhanced
social security payments for single parents were leading to a growth in
the number of unmarried mothers while acting as a disincentive to
unemployed fathers to live under the same roof as their families.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar had no doubt where the
blame lay. ''I'm quite clearly pointing the finger at Government
policy,'' he said on GMTV's Sunday Programme.
''I think that if present trends ran on unchecked, at some date in the
not too distant future, we would have a divided Britain, so seriously
and bitterly divided that it would, in fact, threaten social cohesion.''
He did not think there was any imminent danger of rioting in the
streets.
''But what I do believe is that, if we go on down this road, then
we're going to have an awful lot of people who are going to be shut out
altogether from any increase in national prosperity or national
opportunity.''

STRATHCLYDE Police now believe that a three-year-old girl taken from
an Argyll hotel last week by her mother is out of the country. The
child's father has legal custody.
Officials at ports and airports across the UK were put on alert by
police on Friday, the day after Mrs Karen Stewart left the Crinan Hotel
with her daughter, Kelly. Mrs Stewart is from New Zealand.
A police spokeswoman said yesterday that a woman airline official in
Glasgow had reported selling tickets to a woman and a child for a flight
to Amsterdam on Thursday.
The airline official alerted police after reading about Mrs Stewart
and Kelly in a newspaper on Saturday.
The police spokeswoman said detectives from Campbeltown were checking
with Dutch authorities to see if the pair had arrived in Amsterdam, and
on their possible movements since then.
It is likely that Interpol will be asked to help in the inquiry.
Detectives feel that Mrs Stewart may be heading for her parents' home in
New Zealand.
The girl's father, Mr Andrew Stewart, of Bellanoch, near Lochgilphead,
had been granted custody of Kelly after the couple separated last year.
He left the child with her mother earlier on Thursday but they had
gone when he went to collect her.
Mr Stewart, 29, a woodcutter, was granted an interim custody order at
Dunoon Sheriff Court on Wednesday, which prevented Mrs Stewart, 34,
taking Kelly out of his care, or out of the sheriffdom of North
Strathclyde.
He said his estranged wife had packed her cases and left her job at
the hotel, where she had worked as a receptionist for the past month.
Mr Stewart said yesterday: ''I am gutted that my estranged wife has
been foolish enough to defy the court order. While I don't think she
will harm Kelly, my concerns will remain until I know she is safe.''
He said CID officers had asked him for the address of his estranged
wife's parents, who live in Mount Maunganui, on New Zealand's North
Island.

<HEADLINE>Mayhew calls for 'give and take' over Ulster</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979878151</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THERE can be no political settlement in Ulster without ''give and
take'', Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, insisted
yesterday as he addressed the pro-Unionist Young Conservative conference
in Southport, Merseyside.
His comments followed a warning by former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit
that the ''shadow of hooded killers'' would hang over any referendum on
the future of Northern Ireland while the IRA refused to give up its
arms.
However, in an apparent bid to calm heightened Unionist fears about
the future of Ulster, Sir Patrick said: ''We shall not propose ideas,
all of which meet the ambitions of one tradition and none of which will
be welcome to the other.
''That would result in more, not less conflict. That, too, is nowadays
widely accepted in Northern Ireland. There can be no settlement without
some give and take.''
Alluding to the politically explosive leak of a late draft of the
Anglo-Irish framework document on the future of Northern Ireland, Sir
Patrick said: ''A recent disruptive event has been received in the
province with anxiety, no doubt, but with admirable calm and balance.''
He stressed that the joint framework document would contain ''ideas''
and was not a blueprint but ''something for the parties to consult
about, not something to impose''.
London and Dublin were not there yet, he said, but should be able to
succeed before long.
His speech came less than 24 hours after Lord Tebbit, injured in the
IRA Brighton bombing, was loudly applauded when he attacked the
Government for keeping the Unionists ''in the dark and uninvolved'' in
the development of the framework document.
Lord Tebbit said Mr Major had promised the people of Northern Ireland
the last word about their future, in a referendum.
''But if the IRA remains in being as a military terrorist
organisation, still holding on to its guns and bombs, then that
referendum would be conducted with those guns at the back of the head of
the people of Northern Ireland,'' he said.
''If you vote no to the new constitution, they will be told, then you
will be voting for a renewal of the killing.
''In those circumstances, the referendum would be held under duress --
in the shadow of the armed and hooded killers.''
''It would be a dishonourable process and, whatever the result, would
lead only to renewed violence.''
Shortly before Lord Tebbit's speech, national chairman of the Young
Conservatives, Mr Adrian Lee, emphasised the Tory party youth wing's
commitment to the people of Northern Ireland, saying Young Tories would
''go to the wall'' for the union.
Mr Lee was cheered when he said it was a ''great shame'' that the
Unionist community felt totally excluded from negotiations between
London and Dublin, when Unionists had given the Government such sterling
support in the Commons.
Sir Patrick -- in a speech interpreted as a clear appeal to Unionists
not to wreck the peace process -- attempted to assuage fears by telling
Young Tories: ''We cherish the union.''
He said the union was supported by a very large numerical majority in
Northern Ireland and he had been told that 70% of Catholics there were
in no hurry to join a united Ireland.
Departing from his prepared text, Sir Patrick said: ''With the
progression of peace, people in nationalist areas are more and more
turning to the RUC as a working police force with normal duties.
''I think in turn they would give the RUC a lot of help if violence
were to return.
''If anyone tried violence again, I think they would be seen off by
the public.''

<TEXT>
VETERANS of the fight against Saddam Hussein who claim to be suffering
from Gulf War syndrome yesterday welcomed the creation of two new groups
which, they believe, will help convince a sceptical Ministry of Defence
that the sickness exists.
Researchers established the Gulf Syndrome Study Group this weekend to
gather information about the sickness.
Meanwhile, Ms Hilary Jones, 44, a former major who served with Army
nursing staff in the Gulf, has been given a place on the Gulf Welfare
Group, set up this month to act on behalf of people like herself who
believe they are suffering from the illness.
Mr Eddie Blench, co-chairman of the Gulf Veterans Association, said:
''These are important steps forward for us.''
Mr Blench, 33, who has suffered eyesight problems, energy loss,
blisters, and mood swings since serving as a lance-corporal in the First
Armoured Division HQ and Signal Regiment in the Gulf War, said the main
problem was the MoD's disbelieving attitude.
''I was just a corporal in the army so the MoD wouldn't take much
notice of me,'' he said. ''The members of these groups are powerful
people who will be listened to.''
He said the group's members included Tory MP Edwina Currie; Colonel
Terry English, the Royal British Legion's controller of welfare; and
Colonel Simon Brewis of the Army Benevolent Fund.
The Gulf Syndrome Study Group has been set up by a 20-year-old working
party of independent scientists and doctors concerned with the effects
of chemical and biological weapons.
''We are all well versed in what these weapons can do,'' said group
administrator Elizabeth Sigmund. ''We don't know what causes this Gulf
War syndrome yet, although we know a lot of factors that may be
involved.''
The group said it already had evidence that warnings from drug
manufacturers against giving some innoculations at the same time as
others, and about after-effects of anti-nerve gas pills, had been
ignored.

A SAMPLE of people who used legal services in Scotland during one year
showed that 91% were satisfied with the help they received, according to
a survey published today.
The Scottish Office survey, the result of research based on interviews
with nearly 4500 households showed that 85% of people would return to
the same adviser.
Only 8% of people said that they had, at some time, felt really
annoyed with the way their legal adviser dealt with the case and
two-thirds of them felt like making an official complaint.
Only 13% of those who had used legal services had been told by their
adviser of the complaints procedure.

TWO men were seriously ill in hospital last night after road accidents
on Saturday. Mr Hugh Strathearn, 67, of Albert Road, Glasgow, was
crossing Crown Street near Caledonia Road about 8.15pm when he was hit
by a car whose driver failed to stop. He was taken to Victoria Infirmary
and was in a stable condition. Police said the car was a white Vauxhall
Cavalier and appealed for witnesses to the collision.
Two hours earlier, Mr John Cuthbert, 57, of Fulshaw Crescent, Ayr,
received a serious head injury when he was hit by a car as he crossed
the town's Main Road. He was taken to Southern General hospital,
Glasgow, where he was said to be serious but stable.

<HEADLINE>Cantona took flying kick at our reporter, says ITN</HEADLINE>

SOCCER star Eric Cantona was at the centre of new controversy
yesterday after allegedly being involved in another kung-fu style attack
similar to the trouble at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Ground in south
London last month.
The Manchester United player, holidaying on Guadaloupe in the West
Indies after his outburst involving a Palace fan, is accused of becoming
involved in a fracas with a TV crew.
ITN said its crew went to the Caribbean island to ask the French star
when he is to return to England.
It said the three-man team -- reporter Terry Lloyd, cameraman Mike
Inglis, and soundman Mark Lyons -- politely approached Cantona on a
public beach at Guadaloupe.
Mr Lloyd told ITN News that Cantona ignored all their questions.
''He then grabbed me in a headlock and said 'come with me I'd like a
chat with you'.''
Cantona let Mr Lloyd go and walked over to the other crew members,
suggesting they should go ''somewhere quiet''.
''Suddenly, without warning, he came running at me, launched into the
air, and kicked me in the chest,'' said Mr Lloyd.
Mr Lloyd said that while he was down on the sand, Cantona stood over
him and said: ''I'm going to kill you.''
The TV crew called the police, who ordered them to hand over the film
to them, saying they would give it to Cantona.
ITN foreign news desk assistant Tony Fisher said the camera team
stopped filming and helped to get Mr Lloyd released from the player's
grip after he imposed the headlock.
''Then Cantona came running back and went into a flying kung-fu style
kick and kicked Terry in the chest,'' he added.
He said Mr Lloyd had not seen a doctor but had some chest pains.
ITN foreign news editor Robin Staniforth said of the alleged attack:
''We were filming on a public beach and I'm very keen to stress that. We
were about 40 feet away with a camera crew.
''He spotted us and came off the private beach on to the public beach.
He threatened him.
''Subsequently, he kicked him in the chest and bruised him at the very
least.''
Detectives in south London were angry when the Old Trafford idol
failed to appear for questioning at South Norwood police station on
Wednesday about the initial incident two weeks ago.
On Saturday, Manchester United's manager Alex Ferguson was understood
to have told Cantona not to return to his home because camera crews were
still camped outside.
Cantona has been banned from Premiership football for the rest of the
season by his club and fined two weeks' pay -- the maximum sanction
under his contract.
He is also due to appear before the Football Association's
disciplinary committee on February 24 to answer its charges against him.
Whether or not he will face any criminal charge will depend on the
Crown Prosecution Service, who have been sent the relevant papers.
The FA seems likely to consider that what happened on an island
several thousand miles away is outside their jurisdiction and will take
no further action.
''We are in touch with Manchester United to establish the full facts
of what has happened. Until we establish those facts, there is nothing
else we can say,'' said Mr David Davies, the FA's director of public
affairs yesterday.
The FA have yet to decide if they will punish Cantona further for the
Selhurst Park affair -- United having already banned him for the rest of
the season and fined him around #20,000.
0 United have so far remained silent but there is no doubt this latest
incident will further tarnish the club's reputation.

THE Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday criticised a fellow churchman
for ''preaching through headlines'' about the break-up of the Prince of
Wales's marriage.
Dr George Carey also accused the Archdeacon of York, the Venerable
George Austin, of ''megaphone theology''.
The archbishop was speaking publicly for the first time about Mr
Austin's new book, Affairs of State, in which he questions Prince
Charles's behaviour and his future role.
Dr Carey said: ''In an issue such as that of the Royal Family, it's
all very well to talk about, as he seems to be, megaphone diplomacy or
megaphone theology.
''But the Christian Gospel is not simply about condemnation. It's
about renewal, it's about hope.
''And what he cannot know, or perhaps he has not attempted to find
out, is that there are people such as myself giving guidance and
leadership -- but giving it in a pastoral way.
''It is a deeply personal relationship. Now we have to recognise that
there are different levels through which the Christian faith is
communicated -- but preaching through the headlines and condemning
people for sins is not the way I would want to go about it.''
Dr Carey told BBC Radio Four's Sunday programme in an interview from
India with Mike Wooldridge, that he liked Mr Austin as a man but thought
his book was ''slight and superficial''.
''I simply do not recognise the church he describes,'' said Dr Carey,
after reading Mr Austin's criticisms of the Church of England.

ENGLISH regional assemblies will not be given tax-raising or
legislative powers like those proposed for a Scottish parliament, Mr
Jack Straw, Shadow Home Secretary, said yesterday.
His assurances on BBC TV's On The Record indicated that solving the
West Lothian question is less important to the Labour leadership than
avoiding a potential backlash from English voters if the party tries to
give them bodies they don't want.
Mr Straw emphasised: ''It has never, even in a million years, been
Labour's plan to have regional parliaments with tax-raising powers.''
English assemblies were on Labour's agenda, he said, but the time
scale for achieving them was longer than for Scottish and Welsh
parliaments.
To those Scots who see an Edinburgh ''home rule'' parliament as
virtually sovereign in its own sphere, Mr Straw's remark that
Westminster must remain the final authority, may come as a shock.
Powers devolved are powers retained, he said, and the powers of the
Scottish parliament would derive from Westminster.
Other Labour MPs on the programme conceded that Scotland might not be
able to retain 72 Westminster MPs once a Scottish parliament had been
set up.
Mr Jeff Rooker, Shadow Deputy Leader of the Commons, said that if a
domestic parliament were set up ''then you quite clearly have to look at
the role of the UK Parliament and I don't think you can fudge that''.
Mr Andrew Mackinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, said that if domestic
parliaments were set up in Scotland and some English regions like the
North East, a Labour Government at Westminster might have a mandate on
foreign affairs and major economic policy ''but one has to ask whether
it would have a mandate in respect of English education''.
Mr Rooker suggested that Labour's way out of the difficulty could lie
in adopting PR. He said: ''The first-past-the-post system gives a wholly
unfair advantage to the Conservative Party and I think we will have to
tackle that head-on.''
While PR would probably mean more Labour MPs in Southern England, it
would produce more Liberals as well and mean that Labour was unlikely to
rule alone.
Conservative attacks on English assemblies as unwanted and expensive
has produced a more cautious Labour approach to their creation.
Mr Straw, while refusing to pre-empt a paper on his current
consultations, inside and outside the party, to be published in June,
indicated a phased approach.
A first stage would be to establish democratic control over the
various quangos and civil service manned bodies which already exist in
the regions. Each region could be given a development corporation and a
separate democratic body could oversee the health service in each
region.
Mr Blair and his advisers seem to be cooling on the idea of
directly-elected assemblies, at least at first, and are thinking of
manning them with elected councillors.
They are also increasingly aware of the problem of drawing boundaries
which becomes more difficult the further south in England one goes.
Mr Straw said that London, as well as Scotland and Wales, looked a
certain candidate for regional government. However, that would leave a
huge hole in the South East England region which would lack a centre.
Earlier in the same programme, Labour councillor, Mr John Power, of
Oxford, said he had no desire for his city to be part of a South East
region along with, say, Brighton, with which there was no community of
interest, and he had not heard anyone else in Oxford supporting the
idea.

THE closure of the design division at the Rolls-Royce plant at East
Kilbride would hit the development of a new series of engines in a joint
venture in Germany, union officials claimed yesterday.
A delegation of officials are to visit Frankfurt and Berlin tomorrow
for discussions with their counterparts in BRR, the BMW-Rolls-Royce
consortium which is working on a new generation of jet engines.
Last month, Rolls-Royce announced it was closing the aero-engine
design and research facility at the East Kilbride centre, with the loss
of 600 jobs, and transferring its activities to Derby and Bristol.
As part of their campaign to persuade the company to reverse the
decision, union officials are arguing that the change poses a serious
threat to the future of the BRR venture, as the East Kilbride centre has
been involved closely in the design of the new engines.
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions at the plant, said
yesterday: ''The closure will certainly have a delaying effect on the
work being done in Germany but it could also bring it to a complete
stop.
''BRR is a brand-new company and does not yet have the good will to be
able to ride out any slippages. The competition has a lot more muscle.''
He added that the delegation would be telling their German hosts that
Rolls-Royce had not proved any business case for the closure of the East
Kilbride design division.
Joining Mr Thomas in the delegation are Mr Graham Irvine, senior shop
steward for manual workers at the plant, Mr Norrie McIntosh, regional
officer for the Manufacturing, Science, and Finance union, and Mr Adam
Ingram, the Labour MP for East Kilbride.
Rolls-Royce has dismissed claims that the closure of the East Kilbride
design centre could hit the German project. It argues that it can
comfortably handle research and development on existing or future
projects within the capabilities it has at Derby and Bristol.

A 32-YEAR-OLD female office clerk who claimed she had been attacked
and stabbed by a man while working at a psychiatric hospital in Glasgow
has been reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with the
incident.
Strathclyde Police confirmed yesterday that inquiries into an incident
where a woman was allegedly assaulted within an office at the nurses'
home at Leverndale Hospital, Glasgow, were now complete.
A brief statement said: ''We are not looking for anyone else in
connection with this incident. A 32-year-old woman is now the subject of
a report to the procurator fiscal.''
An immediate review of security was ordered at Leverndale after the
alleged attack on January 30. Police inquiries are understood to have
been contained within the hospital.
The incident was claimed to have occurred shortly before 8am in an
office in the administration block at the hospital, on the south side of
Glasgow, despite security procedures already in place, including a
door-entry system.
The woman who claimed to have been attacked was employed by the
Scottish Association for Mental Health.
She was taken to Southern General hospital suffering from a deep stab
wound to her abdomen but has since been released from hospital.

A SINGLE transferable landmine lay in wait for Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson last night in his debate with SNP leader Alex
Salmond over the constitutional question.
Facing each other at claymore's length across the floor of the old
Royal High School building in Edinburgh, they clashed for the television
cameras over what kind of Scottish parliament should meet there --
independent and sovereign, or exercising powers devolved from
Westminster.
The ambush for Mr Robertson came not from his SNP adversary but from a
member of the audience identifying herself as a ''non-party floating
voter''. She asked the two protagonists to list the options of
independence, devolution, and the status quo in their personal order of
preference.
Mr Salmond said that after his first choice of independence, and with
doubts and reservations, he would put devolution second because the
status quo was ''abysmal''.
However, to repeated shouts of ''answer!'' Mr Robertson would only
give devolution as his first choice and refused pointedly to say whether
independence or the status quo came next. Although he described the
latter as ''unacceptable'' he repeatedly refused to specify his choice
between two unpalatable options.
The clash can be seen by BBC viewers tonight.
The question about the personal second choice for the constitution
helped give Mr Salmond a points victory as he concluded with one last
heavy punch: ''There has been some surprise expressed that Ian Lang
isn't here tonight. He doesn't have to be because George Robertson has
used most of his best lines.''
Mr Robertson, for his part, jabbed away at his opponent in an effort
to wear him down in the eyes of the judges as someone who would be
intent on wrecking the body most Scots wanted -- a parliament Mr
Robertson said ''he would be proud to serve in''.
Challenged on such a wrecking role by Mr Andrew Marr, one of the three
London-based Scots journalists acting as inquisitors, Mr Salmond said:
''No. We will want to get Scotland the powerhouse parliament we need.''
He added, in response to a question about what he would do if his
party failed to win a mandate for independence and ended up as a
minority in the devolved parliament: ''Legitimacy in Scotland comes from
the Scottish people. If we were not to succeed then we would have to
participate in a Scottish assembly in the same way as we participate in
Westminster at the moment.''
At the heart of Mr Robertson's case was a desire of Scots for a
parliament that would not break up the UK. ''A strong and powerful
Scottish parliament taking the power out of Whitehall and returning it
to the people, strengthening and renewing our national democracy, will
make a difference. Do we really want to make foreigners of our family
and friends down south?''
Mr Salmond challenged Labour over comments from leading policymaker
Jack Straw that Westminster could make or unmake the devolved body. Mr
Robertson replied that his colleague was speaking in a technical and
legalistic way and in practice no-one would ever attempt to dissolve a
Scottish parliament.
He then challenged Mr Salmond on a separate Scottish currency, leading
to a series of lively exchanges on Tyneside Metro shopping with Scots
notes, exchange rates, the possession of credit cards, and the Irish
experience.
The other exiled Scots journalists asking the questions, Mr James
Naughtie and Mr Neal Ascherson, implied that the two party leaders
should bury their differences for the sake of the majority of Scots who
wanted a parliament of some kind.
However, Mr Robertson said ''That's democracy'' and Mr Salmond was
equally disinclined to lower his own sights. Mr Robertson insisted in
conclusion that the key to constitutional change was that Tories
refused, the SNP dreamed, but only Labour would deliver.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said in a statement last night that the
debate was like an argument between ''Tweedledum and Tweedledum''.
Labour and the SNP might pretend otherwise, but they were both on the
same side of the argument.
He said: ''They both support a separate parliament in Edinburgh and
both their proposals, whatever the initial differences, would eventually
result in a separate Scotland.
''The SNP at least advocate an open and direct route. Under Labour's
plan it would be separation by degrees, but the end result would
inevitably be the same.''

THE taxpayer is keeping Scottish private schools in business, a Labour
MP claimed yesterday.
Ayrshire MP Mr Brian Donohue, who represents Cunninghame South,
launched a stinging attack on the Assisted Places Scheme (APS), which
gives less well-off families the opportunity to send their children to
private secondary schools by giving income-related assistance towards
the cost of tuition, fees, and other expenses.
Figures obtained in parliamentary answers from Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, the Education Minister, show that more than #10m was
spent by the Scottish Office in this year's allocation, helping to fund
the education of almost 3000 pupils at Scottish private schools.
''The fact that the independent educational sector in Scotland, which
had been declining in the late seventies, has expanded since the
introduction of the scheme demonstrates that the Government's policy of
Assisted Places has actually propped up private sector education,'' Mr
Donohue said.
He also claimed that, in addition to helping existing schools, the
scheme has encouraged the foundation of new schools, producing figures
indicating that the number of such schools has increased from 90 to 117
since 1981, when the Government set up the scheme.
The Scottish Office's Education Minister was able to confirm that
#10,263,000 was spent in the financial year 1994-5, providing assistance
for the provisional figure of 2854 pupils.
This compares with figures from 1992-3, when #9.6m was used to fund
the education of 3040 pupils, a contrast seized upon by Mr Donohue, who
highlighted what he saw as a woefully expensive scheme to administer.
A Scottish Office spokesman denied the scheme was used to bankroll
private education: ''This is an extremely popular scheme designed for
parents first to help them afford private education, and it leads to
very little direct financial benefit for any of the schools involved.''

MORE than 6000 skiers headed for the slopes at the three Scottish
winter-sports centres which managed to open for business yesterday.
All the action was on the ski centres in the eastern Highlands because
winds gusting to 60mph kept the Nevis range resort at Aonach Mor, near
Fort William, stormbound.
High winds also kept the White Corries, at Glencoe, shut in the
morning.
At Cairngorm, road-signs were erected and warnings were broadcast on
Ski FM from 10.30am telling any other skiers not to turn up.
By then, there were more than 3000 people out on the slopes and a
spokesman for Cairngorm Chairlift Company said the stay-away warning had
been given for safety reasons.
Only six lifts out of 17 were operating there on the lower runs and at
Coire Cas.High winds kept the upper slopes closed.
Temperatures stayed below zero all day at Cairngorm, which had lots of
fresh snow over the weekend.
Several coachloads of Cairngorm-bound skiers headed instead for the
Lecht Ski centre, where 11 out of the 12 uplifts were operating
yesterday on slopes which had new snow on a firm base.
Around 1500 skiers were on slopes, with sunny skies and temperatures
just above the freezing mark and gentle southerly winds at car-park
level.
The ski runs at Glenshee were also busy yesterday, with around 2500
skiers out on the slopes, where sunshine and snow showers were the order
of the day.
Fifteen out of 26 lifts were working as windy conditions kept the
upper runs out of bounds.
Mr David Stewart, of Glenshee Chairlift Company, said: ''Conditions
here are not bad at all and we have quite a lot of fresh snow, with
temperatures just above freezing.''
Skiers can look forward to ''significant' snowfalls during the coming
week.
Unsettled, windy weather will give way to a colder snap from Tuesday,
with fresh snow at most of the ski centres, said Mr Douglas Yule, of
Castle Douglas-based Weather Watchers, yesterday.

TWO gamekeepers were recovering yesterday after their car was washed
more than 400 yards down a fast-moving, swollen river.
Mr Ronald Orritt, 74, and his son, Geoffrey 46, were swept away as
they crossed a ford in the Yorkshire Dales and were dragged along for
two minutes before their car became stuck in some rocks.
After winding down the window, Mr Ronald Orritt climbed out of the car
and trudged over three miles of moorland to the town of Hawes, where he
raised the alarm for his trapped son.
The two men, both from Preston, Lancashire, had been driving home on
Saturday after collecting pheasants to breed for eggs when the accident
happened.
Although they escaped unharmed from their mishap near Widdale Foot
Bridge, on Widdale Beck -- the area has featured in the television
series All Creatures Great and Small -- their cargo of birds was washed
away.
''We were just swept off the ford and down the river, completely out
of control,'' said Mr Geoffrey Orritt.
''The car floated along like a boat, as we crashed into rocks and went
over rapids -- it was all a bit exciting.
''We got stuck on rocks after a couple of minutes and dad climbed out
of the window. I was trapped and, after he left, I wound up the window
to keep the water out and waited.''
Firefighters freed Mr Geoffrey Orritt from his watery seat. Both men
were well yesterday, although Mr Ronald Orritt said he was a bit stiff
after his trek.
''We usually go over the ford in my Land Rover, not a little Nissan,''
he said. They are now waiting for the water level to drop to rescue the
car.

POLICE mingled with hikers and ramblers yesterday near the lonely
country road where Mrs Margaret Wilson had her throat slashed by a
passing motorist.
Officers warned people in Burton Fleming, Humberside, and the
surrounding area, to take care when out walking.
''It's just a matter of being cautious -- take a friend with you,''
said a spokesman.
''We don't want to frighten people from going out but it's just the
situation we find ourselves in while the murderer is on the loose.''
Mrs Wilson, 66, a keen rambler, was attacked between Burton Fleming
and Rudstone just moments after being dropped off in a car by daughter
Heather Wilson on Thursday.
The attack was witnessed by two horrified farm labourers, who were
ploughing a field. They recognised Mrs Wilson and ran 400 yards to help
but the driver had jogged back to his car and disappeared.
As detectives continued house-to-house questioning in Burton Fleming,
Detective Superintendent Tony Corrigan, who is leading the murder hunt,
appealed for information about the killer's car, a white Montego estate,
which ''cannot have disappeared into a black hole''.
He has said it was a random killing -- the attacker would not have
known that she was on that road at that time.

SCOTTISH Homes, the national housing agency, has reacted to Labour's
criticisms over the transfer of homes to alternative landlords, and to
claims that the agency is stuffing the pockets of private developers.
Its chairman, Sir James Mellon, today calls on the Shadow Scottish
Secretary, Mr George Robertson, to say how he would secure investment
for housing in Scotland.
Last month, Mr Robertson pressed for the resignation of the agency's
board because of what he described as ''repeated and failed attempts to
persuade its members to allow tenants the choice of their own locally
elected councils as alternative landlords''.
Mr Peter McKinlay, the chief executive, also calls today on Labour's
housing spokesman, Mr John McAllion, to ''put the record straight'' over
claims that Scottish Homes was ''stuffing the pockets of private
developers''.
The demands from the agency's two most senior officials come on the
day that Scottish Homes is the main subject of debate at a Scottish
Grand Committee meeting in Edinburgh.
Tenants from the Freedom of Choice Campaign are expected to lobby the
meeting in support of Labour's resignation demand.
Sir James, in a letter to Mr Robertson, writes: ''You have recently
accused the board of Scottish Homes of denying tenants real freedom of
choice.
''But you have failed to suggest or outline by what alternative method
the substantial resources necessary to improve Scotland's housing might
be found if our present policy was to be abandoned.''
He says private investment can be attracted faster and in larger
amounts if ownership transfers to the independent rented sector, such as
housing associations.
Mr McKinlay, in a letter to Mr McAllion, says he was taken aback by
the Labour MP's claim that Scottish Homes was ''stuffing the pockets of
property developers'' and that more money was being handed out to
developers than was being invested in Scottish Homes.
The remarks were ''wrong and totally misleading'', he writes.
Mr McKinlay said a grant mechanism scheme had been developed as part
of the agency's overall aim of improving the quality and variety of
housing options available.
This allowed the agency to fund a wide variety of projects, enabling
many families, particularly first-time buyers, to buy a home at a price
they could afford, he said.
Grant approval of #27m had brought in #74m of private finance,
contributing to the development of more than 2000 new or improved houses
for sale or rent.
Mr McKinlay said the scheme had made a valuable contribution to
reducing council waiting lists and, by providing opportunities for owner
occupation in areas where they did not exist, had helped to stabilise
communities by enabling people to stay.
Meanwhile, tenants of the agency's 110 homes in Lumphinnans, Fife, are
furious about Dunfermline District Council's exclusion from a transfer
ballot which will decide their new landlord. They insist that they
should be given freedom of choice.
In Livingston, the development corporation's 6500 houses are to be
sold in October next year. The disposal is planned two months before the
corporation is disbanded.
Bids for the houses will be considered from approved landlords,
housing associations, or West Lothian District Council. Tenants will
have a ballot vote to choose a new owner. At present, gross rent income
exceeds #11m from houses, garages, and amenity land.

<HEADLINE>It's Australia by the smoky route as the Lovelaces refuse to travel without a fly drag</HEADLINE>

AN EARL and countess are travelling from the Highlands of Scotland to
Australia the long way . . .because they are smokers.
The Earl of Lovelace found, when making arrangements to take his
Australian wife, Katie, home for a holiday, and so keep a promise to her
grandmother, that the quickest route had one major problem.
Using it, he and the countess, both smokers, would have had to forego
nicotine for many hours because of the no-smoking policy of many major
airlines.
The couple therefore planned their journey from Inverness to
Melbourne, not so much by way of the scenic route as by the smokers'
route.
The couple flew from Inverness to London, then on to Los Angeles.
Then it was on the Honolulu, the Cook Islands, Auckland in New
Zealand, and then the ''hop'' to Australia, all with a couple of days
stop-over at each stage to recharge their nicotine banks.
A friend of the family said: ''They just couldn't face so many hours
without a cigarette, so Peter found out which airlines still allow
smoking and planned the journey accordingly.''
In the spring of last year, just after the earl married the
25-year-old former nurse, the couple visited his in-laws, Lem and Nola
Smolders, at Langwarrin, outside Melbourne.
He promised 89-year-old Granny Smolders -- ''a lovely Dutch lady'' --
that he would take his wife home every year.
The earl said at the time: ''Kathie's grandmother was quite firm with
me about what she expected me to do.''
Peter, fifth Earl of Lovelace, whose family seat is at Torridon, in
Wester Ross, is the great-great-great grandson of Lord Byron. He is also
a cousin of the Queen.
Since becoming the countess, Kathie has poured her energies into
improving Torridon House.
New carpets and curtains have been installed, ancient pictures of
ancient Lovelace relatives have been cleaned, and a cosy flat has been
created within the 66-roomed house.
The countess has also taken over a lot of the day-to-day
responsibility for the running of the estate.
One local said: ''She's been like a breath of fresh air.
''She's the best thing that ever happened to Lord Lovelace and, being
a down-to-earth Australian girl, she knows how to keep him in order.
''They seem to be very happy.''

THREE men and a woman were detained by police at the weekend in
connection with alleged drug offences at the Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr.
They are expected to appear today at Ayr Sheriff Court.
There is a fatal accident inquiry currently under way into the
drugs-related deaths last year of three young men, all of whom had been
at the nightclub and died after taking ecstasy.
The four detained in three separate incidents at the club, between
10pm on Saturday and 2am yesterday, were aged from 18 to 24.
Mrs Christine McIntyre, who, with other members of her family,
operates the Pavilion in which Hanger 13 is based, is understood to have
been instrumental in reporting incidents to the police.
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Police said security staff detained four
people and reported to the police. She confirmed they had been held in
connection with alleged offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
They are a 20-year-old male from Neilston, Renfrewshire; a 20-year-old
woman from Dalmarnock; and two men, one 18, from King's Park, Glasgow,
the other 24, from Wishaw, Lanarkshire.
Mrs McIntyre, 48, who is expected to give evidence to the inquiry in
Ayr today, was not available for comment yesterday.
The rave nightclub attracted crowds of more than 1000 from across West
Central Scotland at its peak early last year. However, adverse publicity
surrounding the drugs-related deaths and doubts over the continuation of
the venue's drinks licence have affected attendances.
Only about 500 were at the Pavilion on Saturday night, mirroring
attendances in recent months. Management say entry to the venue, which
costs between #7 and #9, is granted only after stringent security
searches by stewards.
In November, Kyle and Carrick district licensing committee suspended
the club's drinks licence for a year after a complaint from the chief
constable of Strathclyde. McCall's Entertainments, which operates the
Pavilion, has appealed to the sheriff at Ayr and the licence is
operating as normal pending a hearing.
The inquiry heard evidence last week that a range of drugs was
available at the club the night one youth became ill and died after a
rave. One man said he and his friends had taken amphetamine, which they
had bought inside.
The inquiry was also told that a regular drugs dealer at Hanger 13 had
run out of ecstasy tablets the night two young men died, although one
man who travelled from Airdrie for the rave claimed he was able to buy
drugs from the first person he asked.
It also heard a steward say he felt 22 stewards employed to control up
to 1400 people was sufficient.
Mr Fraser McIntyre, 21, of Racecourse View, Ayr, manager of the
Pavilion, told the inquiry that, since the deaths, paramedics, a standby
ambulance, and closed-circuit surveillance had all been introduced.
Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, Ayrshire, and Mr Andrew Dick,
19, from Glasgow, collapsed and died after attending an event on May 1
last year. Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, of Rigside, Lanarkshire, died after
attending a rave event on August 20 last year.

FIVE Scottish islands, an Austrian castle, a French villa, and a Paris
flat are being put on the market by a former Queen's Herald, Count Robin
de la Lanne Mirrlees, because he is being pressed by Lloyd's Insurance
to settle his account.
However, he will not part with his ancestral castle at Inchdrewer in
Banff or his 7000-acre Hebridean island estate of Great Bernera.
The 70-year-old laird has been caught out by being a Lloyd's name in
about 40 syndicates, and owning a salmon farming venture sunk by Norway
dumping of cheap fish.
The count, who inherited three family fortunes, is having to go ahead
with the near #2m sale because he is being pressed to settle his Lloyd's
debts, mainly caused by huge asbestosis awards in America.
Even the telephone at his 60-year-old croft house on Great Bernera has
been cut off -- ''because I can't pay the bill until I sell a few of the
assets''.
The count, who is also a Yugoslavian prince (a title bestowed on him
by his friend, the late King Peter II) is planning to visit the Serbian
islands of Kornat, Zut, Silo, and other ''dependencies'' to start
claiming the rent on the islands he has not visited in the 30 years
since the king gave them to him.
''I am not penniless but I do not have sufficient liquid cash for
Lloyd's. They have been very polite and nice about it but they are now
pressing me in a polite, nice, but now firm way.
''When I saw the thunderstorm approaching and the debts piling up, I
went through mental torture for two years deciding what to sell.
''I have now listed in order of priority what to sell. But definitely
not for sale is Inchdrewer Castle, which has been in the family since
the 1500s, and Great Bernera.
''If I sell the ones I have decided to sell, I will clear my debts and
be content in my old age.''
Up for sale are:
* Ratzenegg Castle, near Villach in Austria, for #500,000, with one
condition: that the new owners provide the count with a flat as a
holiday home for the rest of his life.
* A villa for #410,000 at Le Touquet in France, the home of his late
mother, Countess Frances de la Lanne, whose family made a fortune out of
textiles, property, land, minerals, coffee, tobacco, sugar, and slaves.
* The unoccupied islands off Great Bernera of Flodday, Berisay, Old
Hill, Vacasay, and Little Bernera for a combined #470,000.
* A flat in Paris for #180,000.
* Unspecified ''minor'' assets.
The French-born, Oxford-educated count, whose real father was the
decorated First World War hero and distinquished BBC broadcaster Captain
Duncan Grenille-Milne, has also in the last few years sold a
seven-bedroom house in London's Holland Park for #750,000 and a flat in
Switzerland, mainly to pay off the fish farming debt.
Valuable antiques and paintings have also gone under the hammer and
substantial shares he held on stock markets around the world have been
sold to part fund the Lloyd's debt.
Against the advice of friends -- including that of his 33-year-old
illegitimate son Patrick, the product of a 10-year common law
relationship with a German socialite, the count became a member of
Lloyd's 12 years ago but resigned just before Christmas.
His only marriage to his then 20-year-old nurse (he was 45 at the
time) lasted only a week ''because she thought my friends were
snobbish''.
He held the ceremonial position of Queen's Herald for 17 years, first
as Rouge Dragon then as Richmond.
He said of his insurance losses: ''I am just absolutely bloody furious
towards the American courts for making me sell my mother's home, one of
my castles, and the other stuff because of the ridiculous, cynical, and
spiteful scale of their asbestosis awards. Anybody who had a cough, it
seemed, was due to asbestos.
''I was worth several millions but I do not feel sorry for me -- I
feel sorry for the wonderful people of Great Bernera.
''I fell in love with the people here. That's why I bought the island
in 1962.
''I come from a very philanthropic background and I wanted to provide
university scholarships for young islanders, build an indoor swimming
pool, provide jobs through a hotel, and fund scientific research into
why people here live so long -- but not now I am afraid.
''When I came here, I could have built a mansion but I wanted to live
among the people, be one of them, and not strut around as the new laird.
''My family has always stuck by the principle that you make money by
creative means, and help other people. The Mirrlees supported over 200
orphans, while my real father's family (his mother married for the
second time British General ''Reay' Mirrlees) founded Grinnell College
in Iowa, mainly from a fire sprinkler invention.
''My son inherited a nice sum when he was 15, and he is fine. My
mother's family lost nearly everything in the French Revolution, and
came back. Now it is up to my son to do the same.''

POLICE in Edinburgh were yesterday investigating a fire in a West End
clothing outfitters which is believed to have been started maliciously.
The fire in Wilkies in Shandwick Place is believed to have been
started when inflammable material was pushed through the letter box
shortly after staff left the premises on Saturday night.
The fire caused considerable damage to the entrance area and damaged
the power supply.
The heat shattered a front door window, a few feet from people at a
bus stop.
A taxi driver reported he had seen a group of youths in the doorway
before the discovery of the fire.
Last night, a spokesman for the store said the shop would open for
business today.
Meanwhile, a minor fire occurred in a newsagent across the road from
the outfitters early yesterday.
Firemen were called out shortly after 3am to the R S McColl premises
where they found furniture alight in the basement. The fire was quickly
put out and the shop was open for business yesterday.

LABOUR MP George Galloway was keeping an open mind last night on
whether the theft of a computer from his constituency office in Glasgow
had sinister political overtones.
Special Branch officers and House of Commons security chiefs were
alerted at the weekend after Mr Galloway, MP for Glasgow Hillhead,
discovered that his office in Elderslie Street had been broken into on
Saturday morning.
Mr Galloway's fear that the computer theft may have been politically
motivated stems from the leading role he has assumed in attacking the
ruling regime in Bahrain.
Two weeks ago in The Herald, Mr Galloway claimed British mercenaries
were propping up the oil rich country, a former British possession.
Mr Galloway alleged the emirate was using its security forces, staffed
and trained by British ex-military personnel, to suppress calls for
democracy by opponents of the ruling royal family.
The MP has called on the Prime Minister to investigate the activities
of British citizens working with the emir's security forces, and has
tabled a parliamentary question asking for the background of some of
these men to be disclosed.
Nine people have been killed, more than 1500 people detained without
charge, and dozens illegally deported in the emir's latest crackdown on
pro-democracy opponents.
Mr Galloway said yesterday he did not know if he had been getting
under the skin of certain people in Bahrain and whether someone had
ordered the theft to try to see if he was drawing up a list of culprits.
''But I don't have any evidence,'' he said.
The MP said he had discovered the theft himself at about 10.45am on
Saturday. ''I was passing in my car when I saw the doors to the office
were open. I screeched to a halt then ran in and discovered the office
had been burgled.''
He hurried to a friend's house, where he phoned 999. ''I expected
police cars to come screeching round the corner but this didn't happen.
Thirty-five minutes later, two bobbies came plodding up.''
Mr Galloway said the thieves had cut through a padlock and four
separate locks, which argued a degree of professionalism.
They had taken only his Apple computer and disregarded other
equipment, including a laser printer, fax machine, and two radios, worth
four times the value of the computer. This, allied to the
professionalism, tended to suggest it was a political break-in with
thieves after material connected with his Bahrain campaign.
He said: ''However, if it was political, it was incompetent because
they left a box full of disks sitting next to the computer. This is an
extraordinary blunder. They should not be paid for what is a sloppy
job.''
The disk in his stolen computer contained nothing but telephone
numbers and his diary. ''There were also notes on 14 housing cases in my
constituency. All my sensitive files are kept in a safe in the House of
Commons.''
Mr Galloway said he was not ruling out common theft. However, he
absolved anyone local from the blame. ''None of the local neds would
have done it. I'm popular there and local people keep an eye on my
office.''
He said fingerprint experts had taken away one print from the back of
his desk.
He added that he had spent #1500 on new security measures at his
constituency office.
Strathclyde police said they were investigating the break-in.
* Bahrain, linked to Saudi Arabia by a causeway, was given its
independence from Britain in 1973, when a parliament was set up. This
parliament was closed on the orders of the ruling royal family in 1975,
according to Mr Galloway.
Sporadic uprisings agitating for the return of this parliament, with
the latest beginning in December last year, have met with savage
treatment, he added.

MATERNITY hospitals throughout Scotland are sure to scrutinise their
security measures following the abduction of baby Lydia Owens in Wales.
There will be lessons to be learned, just as there were after the case
of Abbie Humphries, taken from a Nottingham hospital in last July.
That case prompted Scottish maternity units to look carefully at their
security arrangements. Many are considering the use of electronic
tagging so that anybody trying to snatch a baby would set off an alarm.
By coincidence, a pilot trial of baby tagging began at Edinburgh's
Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion days after Abbie was abducted. Those
tests, involving different systems, have recently been completed and the
hospital plans to introduce its preferred option in the next few weeks.
It will also submit a report of its findings to the Scottish Office
Home and Health Department, which will pass on the results to other
hospitals and health boards.
However, the Edinburgh hospital was not the first in Scotland to use
electronic tagging. Law Hospital NHS Trust at Carluke, Lanarkshire,
installed a #6000 full system in its maternity unit four months before
the pilot scheme started.
It appears to have been a success and could provide other hospitals
with part of the answer to the dilemma of how to ensure adequate
protection without unduly restricting public access.
''You either have open visiting in maternity or you don't,'' said Mrs
Irene Barkby, midwifery business manager at the unit. ''We do not
advocate making these places into prisons.
''I think the security now is as good as you are going to get without
having a lock-down in place.''
Representatives of about a dozen other hospitals have visited Carluke
to see how the system works and Mrs Barkby believes that at least one of
them has decided to introduce tagging.
The system is not compulsory. Mothers are asked whether they want
their babies tagged and they all do. This no doubt reflects a greater
awareness among mothers of the possibility of abduction and the need to
reduce the risk.
Would such a tagging system have prevented the Welsh incident? ''It
would have been less likely to happen. Our system sets alarms ringing
all around the unit. If the baby had been ours, we would hope it would
have been discovered before it was outside the building.''
Other security features at Law hospital's maternity unit include
surveillance cameras.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said yesterday: ''After the Abbie
Humphries case, all hospitals started to look at their own security all
the more closely, without any general guidance from the Scottish Office.
It was just common sense.''
Apart from the imminent introduction of a full tagging system, the
Simpson Memorial unit has already stepped up security.
At Glasgow Royal Infimary University NHS Trust's maternity hospital at
Rottenrow, security cameras have been introduced in recent months and
administrators are awaiting the results of the Edinburgh tagging trial.
Several other changes in procedures have been introduced in line with
advice from the Royal College of Midwives.
A hospital spokeswoman said: ''The problem is trying to get the
balance right, so that people in hospitals feel secure but the hospital
is still accessible to the community it serves. We are not running
Barlinnie prison.''
The Royal Aberdeen Hospitals NHS Trust's maternity hospital is looking
very closely at tagging and is awaiting quotations and specifications
from three suppliers.
Surveillance cameras are about to be installed at Dundee Teaching
Hospitals NHS Trust's maternity unit at Ninewells. It is also
considering whether to introduce tagging. Again, various other special
procedures have been introduced since the Abbie Humphries case.

A GROUP of Scottish Labour MPs, outraged at what they see as a blatant
attack on freedom of speech, are set to go against the party's ruling
executive by providing a stall at next month's party conference for
banned anti-abortion campaigners.
The Scottish Labour Party's executive barred the protest group, Labour
for Life, from last year's conference and ruled to uphold the ban for
this year's event, to be held in Inverness.
That decision prompted a furore both within the party and externally,
with Cardinal Thomas Winning angrily contacting Labour leader Tony Blair
twice to protest.
Yesterday, Mrs Helen Liddell, MP for Monklands East, told The Herald a
number of Scottish Labour MPs had been so perturbed by the banning of
Labour for Life they intended to provide a stall themselves for
literature from the group.
She said: ''A group of us of varying religions and opinions were
sitting in the Commons tearoom and this came up. This issue has always
been recognised as a question of conscience and there was a feeling that
this ban was quite outrageous.
''The issue is one of democracy and we decided it would be right for
us to provide a stall for people's views to be expressed.''
One of the group is now investigating the procedure for booking a
stall, which is expected to cost the MPs more than #2000 for the three
day conference in March.
Mrs Liddell said the subject of the row, abortion, was irrelevant.
''The cause they are pushing doesn't matter. This is a question of
freedom of speech.''
She said she did not forsee any clash with the party's executive
despite the fact the ruling body had explicitly decided to continue the
ban on the anti-abortion group.
Mr Jim Devine, chairman of the Scottish Labour Party, also tried to
play down the conflict but added significantly: ''The MPs involved in
this should be looking to follow party policy.''
He said he felt the executive was the victim of unwarranted criticism
over the conference ban: ''All we're doing is following British
guidelines. A ruling was passed by the NEC (the British Labour Party's
policy making body) in the mid-80s about this group and now we're
implementing it.''
Mr Devine said he believed that ban had been motivated by problems
experienced in England, though he was unable to provide details of any
incidents.
The MPs' proposal, while welcomed, failed to mollify the Catholic
Church in Scotland. Cardinal Winning has written twice to Mr Blair
urging him to intervene and yesterday the Cardinal's press agent
indicated his anger that the ban remained.
Father Noel Barry said: ''Even if this back-door compromise does
happen, that merely pragmatically answers what is a question of
principle, namely the right of free speech.''
He emphasised that the Cardinal still expected Mr Blair to act,
tackling what he saw as the ''frightening intransigence'' of the
Scottish executive and ''clear up what is clearly an absurd situation''.
Mr John Connelly, co-ordinator of Labour of Life, said last night that
he would be contacting the party's national general secretary, Mr Tom
Sawyer, asking for the group's case to be heard.
It is believed to have members in more than 30 Scottish constituency
parties, and had operated an information stall at five previous Scottish
conferences prior to the 1994 ban.

A #170,000 special needs centre is to be opened in Dundee to support
students with disabilities.
The regional facility, based at Dundee University, also involves the
University of Abertay, Northern College, and St Andrews University.
It will aim to improve provision particularly for students with
dyslexia and visual impairments, groups which account for the majority
with special needs.
Of around 17,000 students at the four institutions, 246 have been
identified as having a disability and, of that number, more than 120 are
dyslexic and at least 14 are visually impaired.
The centre contains a range of equipment including computers with
speech recognition facilities, Braille printer, and specialised
software.
Mr Steve Cannon, Dundee University deputy secretary, said: ''The
establishment of such a centre will be a great asset to students with
special needs throughout Tayside and Fife and underlines Dundee's
position in the vanguard of special-needs provision and expertise in
Scottish higher education.''
''In addition to providing support for students with special needs,
the centre could potentially be available to provide support to the
local population.''

THE campaign to save the Motorail and sleeper services to Fort William
continued to gain momentum at the weekend with a rally in Inverness,
where Highland MPs urged protesters to keep up the pressure.
Railworkers in Fort William, meanwhile, were talking of industrial
action.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye,
told the rally, attended by more than 100 in Inverness Town House on
Saturday, he thought the campaign was beginning to make progress.
He said: ''The fightback which started in Fort William one month ago
has come a long way already. Following the various events of the past
week, I am confident that it will prove simply impossible to foreclose
the Motorail and sleeper services in advance of a comprehensive
consultation exercise. This is a decisive breakthrough in itself.
''However, we have to keep the pressure up. There is no way that
Scottish Office Ministers must be allowed off the hook. They must be
left in no doubt that the political and parliamentary pressure is more
than matched by the public generally.
''That is why I urge everyone in the hall today, and everyone outside
it across the Highlands, to put pen to paper and write to the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Transport. The bigger the deluge
of mail, the better the prospect of victory.''
Mr Kennedy said he and his parliamentary colleagues would be meeting
the chairman of the UK Rail Users Consultative Committee this week to
discuss tactics.
''I am greatly encouraged that both the UK and Scottish RUCCs have
taken such a consistent and strong line. That again strengthens the
case.''
His colleague, Sir Russell Johnston, meanwhile, called on the Rail
Regulator to intervene to instruct the Rail Franchise Director, Mr Roger
Salmon, to put the Motorail and sleeper services to Fort William and
Carlise back into the passenger service requirements.
Despite the growing confidence of the campaigners, there is no
indication that Mr Salmon is being persuaded to think again. The Herald
tried to contact him to ask his reaction to the news last week that
Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro had given a commitment to a
full formal consultation on the proposed cuts.
Mr Salmon was not available but his office later issued a statement
which made clear that, while he would listen to arguments, the services
would still be withdrawn.
The statement said: ''The franchising director has indicated that he
will not include the Motorail and Fort William sleeper services in the
draft passenger service requirement (PSR) for the ScotRail franchise,
which he will be issuing later this year, probably by the end of May.
''The franchising director does, however, take into account
representations on services he has not included in draft PSRs and this
will be the case in respect of the overnight services to Fort William.''
Meanwhile, Mr Phil McGarry, Scottish organiser of railworkers' union,
RMT, met local members in Fort William at the weekend to discuss
management plans for the West Highland Line, which include shedding jobs
in the town and transferring others to Mallaig. The withdrawal of
overnight services was also on the agenda.
Mr McGarry said afterwards: ''There were calls for the union to look
at the possibility of seeking a ballot for industrial action.''
He said he would be writing to the general secretary of the Scottish
Trades Union Congress demanding that a national transport conference be
held in Scotland to address the Government's transport policy and call
for the rescinding of the Railways Privatisation Act of 1993.
* Meanwhile, the Stop This Railway Madness (STORM) campaign is
distributing thousands of postcards to supporters to send to the Rail
Regulator demanding that formal consultation takes place before sleeper
or Motorail services are withdrawn.
Mr Brian Wilson, Opposition spokesman on trade and industry, said:
''The consultation should not only be about whether the Tories are
allowed to close these services, as part of their demented rail
privatisation scheme, but also about how they could be promoted and made
more viable. That is the debate we have never been allowed.''

<TEXT>
A 39-year-old woman was charged last night with the abduction of baby
Lydia Owens, from Glam Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan, Clwyd, North Wales,
police disclosed.
Three men, aged 22, 23, and 29, who were also helping police with
their inquiries after the kidnap of the baby on Friday, were released
from police custody yesterday without charge.
The woman, who comes from Rhyl but has not been identified, will
appear before Prestatyn magistrates today.
Details of the charge came shortly after the baby's parents, Christine
and Michael Owens, took their six-day-old daughter home from the
hospital, where all three had been since she was recovered on Saturday
night.
The couple said an emotional goodbye to Staff Nurse Meryl Webster, who
had comforted them after their baby -- then only four days' old --
disappeared from her cot in the maternity unit.
Mrs Ownes and her husband, 38, a hotel porter in Llandudno, left the
hospital maternity unit to rejoin their other children, Kathryn, four,
and Andrew, one.
Police said that a flood of information had followed a televised
appeal by Mrs Owens, 32, on Saturday evening.
A former woman soldier told yesterday how her military training helped
her lead police to the baby.
In newspaper reports, Belinda Ralph, 25, said she saw a couple with a
child just minutes after learning of the abduction, and became
suspicious of their behaviour.
She noted down the number of the car they were getting into, and
phoned the police.
She said she had been seven years in the Army and served in Germany
where there were regular terrorist attacks, and had been taught always
to be on the alert.
Police praised her quick thinking for saving them hours of work.
Before the couple emerged from the hospital, solicitor Liz Choat read
a brief statement on their behalf, thanking ''police and hospital staff
for all their support and help and indeed to the press for their
assistance in giving vital publicity''.
There were no security cameras in the two-year-old maternity unit, and
an investigation is under way.
Mr Ian Bellingham, a spokesman for Glam Clwyd Hospital, said it did
not believe cameras were the complete answer to hospital security.

A MAN drowned yesterday when he fell into a flooded river while
searching for his son, who had already been found by his two older
brothers.
The 39-year-old man was walking with his three sons when the youngest,
aged four, fell in upstream of a tunnel carrying flood water.
As the man started a frantic search, he also fell in and was carried
through the tunnel and into a weirpool below.
The accident happened on the West Sussex/Hampshire border.
A police spokesman said the older brothers, aged 10 and seven, found
the young boy and pulled him from the water.
''Despite the strenuous efforts of his children, their mother, a
neighbour and an ambulance crew, the man was found to be dead on arrival
at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester,'' he said.
His name was being witheld until all his relatives had been informed.
Two gamekeepers meanwhile were recovering yesterday after their car
was washed more than 400 yards down a fast-moving, swollen river.
Mr Ronald Orritt, 74, and his son, Geoffrey, 46, were swept away as
they crossed a ford in the Yorkshire Dales and were dragged along for
two minutes before their car stuck in rocks.
Mr Ronald Orritt climbed out of a window and trudged over three miles
of moorland to the town of Hawes, where he raised the alarm for his
trapped son.
The two men, both from Preston, Lancashire, had been driving home on
Saturday after collecting pheasants to breed for eggs. The birds were
washed away.
''The car floated along like a boat, as we crashed into rocks and went
over rapids: it was all a bit exciting,'' said the son.

<TEXT>
TV presenter Paula Yates and singer Bob Geldof have agreed to a trial
separation after 18 years together, it was reported yesterday.
The couple announced their intention to take a break from ''being in
each other's faces all the time'' in a faxed note to the News of the
World, the paper claimed.
The note, written in the style of a press release, says: ''After 18
years of happiness together, Bob and Paula Geldof decided to have a
break from each other for a while.''
It goes on: ''They both love each other fantastically and adore their
children and for them that's all that matters really.
''This is a break from 'being in each other's faces all the time'. Or
to put it in what Bob calls the 'repulsive parlance' of the day, they
are 'giving each other some space'.
''They will see and speak and eat with each other daily, occasionally
go out together and continue to love one another. They are each other's
best friend.''
Neighbours of the couple seemed unaware of their rift.
Neither the rock singer nor the Big Breakfast presenter were at their
#450,000 Victorian terrace home in Chelsea.
A woman who said she had lived in the street for 60 years said she had
last seen Yates on Friday after she came back from doing her show.
''She was with her nanny and she appeared to have some packed bags and
they left in a red van.''
The woman, who refused to give her name, added: ''I haven't seen him
for a while. I don't like him. He's scruffy.''
Other neighbours did not want to speak about the couple. One said:
''They're quite secretive -- they keep themselves to themselves.''
One report said both stars had gone on holiday to get away from the
''ructions'' caused by their announcement.
A Channel 4 spokesman said Paula Yates would not be appearing on the
Big Breakfast show this week.
''She was already rostered to be away on holiday this week,'' he
added.
He could not say how long the holiday had been arranged or how long
she was due to be away, he said.

<HEADLINE>More crime warning on prisoners' rent cut</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979878186</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PLANS to scrap housing benefit for prisoners serving more than three
months are today condemned by the Penal Affairs Consortium, a pressure
group which says the move could lead to more crime.
The idea of reducing the time a prisoner's rent will be paid from 52
weeks to 13 weeks was announced by Social Security Secretary Peter
Lilley at last October's Conservative conference. ''We shouldn't go on
paying criminals' rents. They should be paying their debt to society,''
he said.
In its submission to the social security advisory committee, the
consortium says the move is short-sighted and likely to increase crimes
committed by released prisoners.
A ''substantial number'' would lose their homes and possessions
between their 13th and 52nd week in custody as a result, it said.
It quoted Home Office research indicating that prisoners who were
homeless on release were more than twice as likely to re-offend as those
with homes.
Mr Paul Cavadino, who chairs the PAC, said: ''Any money saved by the
change is likely to be lost several times over by the costs of further
offending, including the cost of police time, court time, and further
prison sentences. The Government should think again and withdraw this
misguided proposal.''
Ms Mary Honeyball, general secretary of the Association of Chief
Officers of Probation, one of the groups in PAC, said: ''This
contemptible measure will be as counter-productive as it is
vindictive.''
The PAC alliance includes probation officers' groups, the Prison
Officers' Association and Prison Governors' Association, and campaigners
such as the Howard League for Penal Reform.

EXCLUSIVE
THREE Scottish women are to receive more than #20,000 following
out-of-court settlements of long-standing claims for equal pay for work
of equal value.
Their cases were among 30 lodged with 17 electricity companies in 1990
by their union, Unison, which points out that the awards coincide with
the 25th anniversaries of both the equal pay and sex discrimination
Acts.
Two of the women work for ScottishPower. Ms Liz Cummings, a
telephonist who has since been promoted to supervisor, won her case at
an industrial tribunal last year and the amount of the award was due to
be determined at a further hearing next week.
However, in an out of court settlement this week, ScottishPower agreed
to bring her previous salary as a telephonist into line with that of a
male store-keeper which, with interest, means a back payment of #14,359.
Another ScottishPower employee Ms Hiliary McGuinness, a mail order
clerk, has also had her salary brought into line with that of a male
store-keeper. This increase, plus backdating with interest, comes to
#6698.
Unison assistant secretary for electricity Ms Judith Secker said she
was pleased with the settlements but regretted that Scottish Power had
not reacted like other electricity companies which settled similar
claims years ago.
In a third out-of-court settlement this week, Ms Margaret Ferguson, a
stores clerk with Scottish Nuclear, received an undisclosed payment
after her salary was upgraded in line with that of a male store-keeper.

PERSONAL friendship took a back seat last night as two senior
councillors battled for a seat on the new Glasgow unitary authority.
The contest to be Labour candidate at Cardonald resulted in a
comfortable victory for senior district councillor James McCarron over
Strathclyde regional councillor Joseph McLean.
They are close personal friends; indeed Mr McLean is godfather to Mr
McCarron's youngest son.
The victorious Mr McCarron said last night: ''I didn't want it to be
like this but politics is a cruel discipline.
''My friendship with Joe McLean is undiminished.''
Both hold senior positions on their respective councils.
Mr McCarron chairs the district council's policy control board, which
has authority over the building and works department, while Mr McLean is
chairman of economic and industrial development with the regional
council.

THE Prime Minister yesterday promised to fight to maintain immigration
controls.
However, his letter replying to Mr Charles Wardle, who resigned from
the Government on Saturday, implicitly admits that the UK will come
under pressure from its European Union partners to accept total freedom
of movement within the union.
Mr Wardle, 55, who was the Home Office Minister in charge of
immigration for two years before being moved sideways to the Department
of Trade and Industry in last year's reshuffle, fears that more lax
procedures in other member states will mean that illegal immigrants
admitted by another partner could move on into Britain without hindrance
if current checks are dropped.
Mr Wardle, MP for Bexhill and Battle, said yesterday that this would
amount to ''leaving the back door open'' and bluntly accused Mr Major of
failing to defend Britain's interests.
He said: ''What we don't want is an unchecked flow of vast numbers of
people who would possibly stay here, creating huge costs for our health,
social security, and housing services. That would be unacceptable. It is
not what the British people want.''
The Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, said: ''I can make it
absolutely clear we have no intention of dismantling our frontier
controls.''
However, Mr David Hunt, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, admitted
on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost that the European Commission was not
satisfied that the British opt-out on immigration (won by Mrs Thatcher
in 1985) is ''as valid as we say it is''. The opt-out was agreed by all
the other EU heads of government at the 1985 summit, when Britain agreed
to the Single European Act.
The European Court of Justice has been asked by the Commission to
interpret Article 7A of the Act on free movement of persons within the
Union.
Britain's position, reiterated by the Home Office yesterday, is that
it concerns only movement of EU citizens and not non-EU visitors, for
whom Britain is entitled to use what controls it thinks appropriate.
Next month, seven EU countries -- Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland,
Germany, France, Spain, and Portugal -- will start operating the
Schengen Treaty they have signed which will require non-EU nationals to
obtain only one visa to visit all of them. Italy and Greece are likely
to join the scheme later in the year.
The timing of Mr Wardle's resignation could be related to this. His
decision raises the profile of immigration as an issue for the back
benches.
He has made plain his misgivings privately to ministerial colleagues
over the past 15 months, but is dissatisfied with their response.
His resignation, the second from the Government in a week following
that of Scottish Industry Minister Allan Stewart, is an embarrassment to
Mr Major, reflected in the rather frosty tone of his reply to Mr
Wardle's resignation letter.
Immigration is always an emotive issue within the Conservative Party
and could become so in the country if Mr Wardle's vision of much larger
numbers of illegal immigrants arriving was accepted by the public.
When he told his constituency why he resigned, he was given a standing
ovation. Bexhill Councillor Jean Hopkinson said: ''What he says is quite
right. Our frontiers should not just be thrown open to everyone.''
Mr Major referred to the existing controls as ''a vital safeguard''.
Mr Howard said the controls would be one of the issues considered by the
Cabinet Committee set up to prepare for next year's inter-governmental
summit.
For the moment, Ministers want to see how the Schengen Treaty
arrangements work and await the ruling on opt-out from the European
Court. It could be the second half of the year before they can judge how
real is the threat to Britain's immigration controls.
Mr Wardle's resignation gives the Tory Euro-sceptics another strong
card to play in arguing that the Government and Parliament are steadily
being stripped of powers which used to be considered essential to nation
states.
It is another headache for party chairman Jeremy Hanley, who was
forced to admit yesterday that on the single currency issue Cabinet
unity only extended to not joining in 1996 or 1997.
He admitted that the Cabinet might have to take a decision in 1999 --
after the next General Election.

THE search for a young bookshop manager from Glasgow who has been
missing in the White Corries area of Glencoe since Friday was called off
last night amid growing fears for his safety.
With gales gusted to more than 60mph, 87 searchers joined the second
day's hunt for Mr Allan Sands, 24, of Torrisdale Street, Strathbungo,
Glasgow, who was last seen on the Inverness-shire boundary with Argyll
on Friday. He had left no details of his planned climbing route -- a
precaution that is always recommended.
A spokesman at the Search and Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Pitreavie
Castle, Fife, said last night: ''We will have to rethink the way ahead
here. Obviously the longer that time passes the less chance we have of
finding Mr Sands alive. But the search will continue in the morning.''
Members of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team, who had scoured the area on
Saturday for Mr Sands, were joined yesterday by three other mountain
rescue teams, members of the Search and Rescue Dog Association, and a
search and rescue helicopter.
The area was swept by blizzards on Friday night, followed by a rapid
thaw on Saturday, prompting fears that Mr Sands might have been caught
in a avalanche.
Nine other climbers caught in avalanches and a spate of other
accidents this weekend in the Cairngorms should never have been in the
area, one expert claimed yesterday.
Mr Blyth Wright, a spokesman for the Scottish Avalanche Information
Service, said warnings had been issued on Friday night and again on
Saturday that areas like Coire An t'Sneachda in the Cairngorms were high
avalanche risks. Eight people were taken to hospital but no-one was
seriously injured.
''I am surprised that anyone was in that area. We urge hillwalkers to
check our information line before going on the hill so they can avoid
this sort of trouble,'' Mr Wright said.
He added: ''I do not know the full circumstances of the avalanche
incident and whether these people should have checked beforehand, but
the kind of conditions they would have immediately experienced in that
area were pretty clear.
''There was a high avalanche risk and they should not have continued
their climb. I spoke to an experienced Alpinist and he did not go into
that area because of the high risk. It is not a place I would have
been.''
Mr John Allen, the leader of Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, said:
''There was a high-risk grade four warning in force for the Cairngorms.
On days like that, climbers can be sitting targets on some of our
slopes. There were 80 to 100 climbers out on Coire An t'Sneachda alone
and it was surprising there were not more casualties.''
''Conditions were ideal for an avalanche in the gullies but there were
dozens of people in the area at the time. It is difficult to keep people
away. They come up for the weekend and do not want to waste their
time.''
Mr Stephen Carr, 20, one of a party of 16 from Newcastle University
fell-walking society, was practising ice-axe techniques yesterday in the
Chalmain Gap area when he fell 25ft into a burn.
He was taken off the mountain by members of the Cairngorm Mountain
Rescue Team and taken to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, with head and
back injuries.
Of eight climbers taken to Raigmore Hospital on Saturday, five were
still detained last night.
The first of a series of incidents in blizzard conditions in Coire an
t'Sneachda, near Aviemore, happened when two climbers, who were roped
together, fell 75ft.
Mr Anthony Park, 29, of Sheffield, was treated for head and leg
injuries in Raigmore Hospital. His colleague, Mr Roger Whetton, 48, from
Stockport, had a broken arm and was released after treatment.
As this incident was being dealt with, an avalanche further down the
same corrie engulfed six climbers. Five of them were injured.
Two climbers from Sheffield, Mr Phillip Birch, 23, and Mr Kevin McNee,
both suffered broken bones. Mr Birch suffered a broken leg and wrist,
and Mr McNee's pelvis was shattered. Mr Geoffrey Haig, 44, and Mr Joe
Lenham, 21, both of Huddersfield, and Mr Miles English, 18, from Elgin,
were all treated for severe bruising. All five were airlifted to
hospital. Mr Haig was released after treatment.
In a separate incident, a climber fell at Cairngorm's Red Gully. The
man, who has not been named, managed to walk off the hill with help from
Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, and was taken to hospital by ambulance.

THE people of Dresden crowded into the city's Roman Catholic cathedral
yesterday to remember and to pray for peace.
Outside stood Mr Derek Jackson, just one of thousands of RAF crew who
took part in one of the Second World War's most horrific attacks 50
years ago.
''The flames could be seen from 200 miles away as we approached the
city,'' the 69-year-old former gunner recalled. ''It was scary but we
knew we had a job to do.''
A firestorm engulfed the city. More than 25,000 were killed and eight
square miles of baroque and Renaissance buildings destroyed.
Yesterday's ceremony was marred when a dozen young protesters ran in
front of the altar and started to unfurl banners before being wrestled
to the ground by security guards.
However, the mood was of peace. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, Prime Minister of
Saxony, said there was no resentment of the past and stressed that the
cathedral altar contained two dates: February 13, 1945, when the raid
began and January 30, 1933, when Hitler came to power.
''These dates commemorate the source of the terrible experience and
the terrible experience itself,'' he said, adding there was ''an
emphasis on reconciliation''.
Mr Jackson, from Manchester, echoed his feelings, saying he was
''welcomed very well indeed''.
In a moving ceremony, 10 simple wooden crosses bearing the names of
cities which suffered appalling destruction were carried to the altar.
They included Coventry and St Petersburg with German ones.
The Bishop of Coventry gave a prayer for peace and its Lord Mayor, Mr
Nick Nolan, said it was a ''wonderful day for our two cities that we can
all meet here at the church and heal our differences and put wars behind
us forever''.
Tens of thousands, many with candles, later filled the streets for a
unique requiem played by bells in 46 churches across the city. Most
people gathered at the bombed-out Church of Our Lady, whose giant
cupola, once Dresden's most famous landmark, is being rebuilt.

THE Scottish Secretary, out to crush demands for self-government,
warned yesterday that a future Tory Chancellor at Westminster might
slash expenditure north of the Border.
By opting for devolution, Mr Ian Lang warned Scots, they would lose
influence in the Cabinet, leaving the way open for a Chancellor to
reduce per capita spending to the same level as the rest of the UK:
resulting in a massive #2845m cut, which would put 19p in the pound on
income tax in Scotland if services were to be maintained.
There was an angry response to Mr Lang's apocalyptic vision of life
under a Scottish parliament. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim
Wallace said his comments ''had struck a new and unpleasant tone which
amounted to bullying tactics'' against those seeking self-government.
''The ever-wilder numbers produced by the Tories show that they know
they are losing the debate,'' said Mr Wallace. ''Nobody who supports a
Scottish parliament suggests that equalisation should be abandoned. Or
would Tory vindictiveness know no bounds?
''He has produced dubious figures which are alarming and designed to
scaremonger, saying that if the Scots take this line a Tory Chancellor
will punish them. It is in keeping with some of the anti-Scots sentiment
being expressed by English Tories in the South, but I must say it is
alarming coming from the Secretary of State for Scotland.''
According to the assistant general secretary of the Scottish Labour
Party, Mr Tommy Sheppard, such tactics showed the debate was running
away from Mr Lang.
''What a shame for Scottish public life that Scotland's first elected
official can't even be bothered to examine properly the proposals he is
so intent on attacking,'' he said.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Lang was now ''howling hysterically
from the sidelines, behaving like a spoilt child because of the lack of
support for him, his party, and their constitutional stance''. He
rubbished the figures as ''the economics of the kindergarten'' and said
it was possible to demonstrate that Scotland was pulling its weight
economically.
Mr Salmond added: ''What is significant is that Lang is directing his
fire at the devolution case because that is signficantly weaker than the
case of independence, which I will happily debate with him any time.''
Mr Lang had issued a statement saying a devolved Scottish parliament
would have serious problems from day one which could be solved only by
taxing the Scots heavily. He cited the fact that, with 8.8% of the UK
population and raising only 8.3% of UK revenue, Scotland received 10% of
UK expenditure.
''By setting up a parliament in Edinburgh, and transferring so much
power from Westminster, we would sacrifice the powers we have at present
to protect Scotland's share,'' he said.
''A British Chancellor could cut our funding and, with no voice in
Cabinet, we would be powerless to stop him. If a Chancellor decided to
reduce the funding transferred to a Scottish parliament to the same
level as the rest of the UK, funding would be cut by almost #2845m.
''To replace that would need additional taxation in Scotland, on top
of UK taxation, of 19p on Scottish income tax just to stand still. We
will put the funding arguments at the centre stage of the debate and
challenge the proponents of change to address the arguments.''
Mr Lang also warned on Jonathan Dimbleby's ITV programme that
devolution would lead down the ''slippery slope to separation'' and was
''dangerous, if you value the integrity of our national state''.
Sources close to Mr Lang denied last night the Scottish Secretary was
being bullying or threatening, and said he was simply pointing out the
fiscal realities to which Scotland would be exposed if the relationship
with Westminster were weakened.
''He isn't saying this cut would automatically happen,'' said an aide.
''He is saying that over time there is a distinct possibility that
Scotland would be unable to get the preferential treatment it is getting
at the moment.
''Negotiations will continue with the Treasury for all spending
departments and Scotland would be an easier target without a Secretary
of State. That's not a threat: it's making people aware of the practical
realities.''
On Mr Lang's economic claims, Professor Brian Ashcroft, director of
the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University, said:
''Broadly, he is probably right that expenditure is greater than revenue
in Scotland but whether he is right in terms of degree is another
matter.''
He said the question of what is UK expenditure is ''very difficult to
disentangle and there is a real need for research in this area''.

PIT Pony galloped through the mud at Ayr to win his first race for
almost six years and bring an overdue success to trainer David
Robertson.
Only two of the six runners in the Marchburn Chase survived the
stamina-sapping race, but Pit Pony loved the conditions and sailed home
by 15 lengths, leaving Sheelin Lad, the odds-on favourite trailing.
He was one of six Scottish-trained winners who found the heavy ground
to their liking on an afternoon of heavy rain in which Uttoxeter called
off and Newbury and Catterick abandoned mid-card.
Pit Pony and his trainer were given a tremendous reception by the
small crowd who braved the elements.
The 11-year-old was popular when based at Cree Lodge, winning won four
hurdle races for John Wilson.
Robertson bought Pit Pony from Linda Perratt 18 months ago, and until
Saturday his best performance had been a fourth at Ayr.
''I always thought he liked heavy ground, but I was by no means
confident.'' he explained.
After Youand I had won the Martnaham Hurdle by 10 lengths from Craigie
Rambler 50-1 -- another Robertson horse -- Len Lungo gave most of the
credit to the owner-breeder, James Nelson.
''They are the backbone of jump racing,'' said Lungo, ''and really
deserve some luck. Nelson, who farms near Lockerbie, also bred her
sister, Linngate, and Bishops Pawn.
Although Sheelin Lad was beaten and Livio fell when exhausted, Lungo
completed a short-priced double when Nawrick, at 4-5, stayed on to beat
Carousel Rocket in the Carsphairn Chase.
With 17 winners he has a lead of five in The Herald Scottish Trainers'
Championship.
Alistair Whillans, the leading permit holder, also is on a winning
streak.
Water Baron, 12-1, a #3600 purchase at Doncaster in November, on his
first run took the juvenile hurdle.
''I thought he might just need the race,'' said Whillans, now on five
winners, one less than last season.
Ask Me Later, trained by Sue Bradburne, won the amateur's hurdle,
while Jim Goldie was successful with Nicholas Plant in the Fisherton
Hurdle.

THE Mitsubishi world championship team, managed by Berwickshire's
Andrew Cowan, trounced the opposition on the Swedish International
Rally, taking first and second places.
Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson, driving a Lancer, was first over the finish
ramp in Karlstad yesterday with his team mate Tommi Makinen from Finland
only 12 seconds behind.
In a bizarre ending, Makinen parked his Lancer 500 metres from the end
of the final special stage, allowing Eriksson to win. Cowan explained
this tactic had been planned on Saturday night after both drivers agreed
it would be foolish to continue racing each other in the worsening
weather conditions.
Mitsubishi's resounding victory on the second round the World
Championship, has promoted 30-year-old Makinen into the lead of the
drivers' championship and the Rugby-based team to first place in the
manufacturers' category.
Last year's winner Thomas Radstrom was third, Finland's Juha Kankkunen
fourth, and defending world champion Didier Auriol fifth. All three were
driving Toyota Celica's.
Lanark's Colin McRae and his Swedish team-mate Mats Jonsson were
unable to restart when their Subaru Impreza suffered oil leaks while
parked on the overnight Parc Ferme. At the end of Saturday's second leg
McRae was fourth overall. Results:
1, K Eriksson/S Parmander (Sweden), Mitsubishi Lancer, 4 hours 51min
27sec; 2, T Makinen/S Harjanne (Finland), Lancer, 4-51-39; 3, T
Radstrom/L Backman (Sweden), Toyota Celica, 4-52-34; 4, J Kankkunen/N
Grist (Finland, Britain), Celica, 4-53-45; 5, D Auriol/B Occelli
(France), Celica, 4-53-47. World Rally Championship for drivers after
two rounds: 1, T Makinen 25 pts; 2, J Kankkunen 22 pts: 3, K Eriksson 20
pts.

* THIS year's Burmah Scottish Rally Championship started with a bang
and ended with one of the closest finishes on record. After 45 miles
over snow-covered, slippery forest roads, David Gillanders won the
Mercury Snowman Rally on Saturday by just two seconds from Chris Wagner.
Going into the final stage, five seconds separated the leaders and
Gillanders thought he had blown it when his Ford Escort Cosworth hit a
patch of ice and spun at 100 mph, but fortunately for him, Wagner's bid
for victory in his Audi 90 Quattro hit similar problems.
Wagner's spins were not quite as lurid but they were more frequent and
he later admitted that he ''never wanted to drive that fast, on those
surfaces, ever again!''
But it was Callum Guy who opened the scoring. He was fastest on the
first special stage and then promptly fell victim to an ice-covered
downhill stretch into a left hand bend. His Toyota Celica didn't
actually crash, it slithered over the edge of the road and simply rolled
over on to its roof.
He wasn't the only one. Former Scottish champion and top seed Raymond
Munro slid into a ditch at the same place and they were followed in
quick succession by virtually the whole 80-car entry.
It was certainly a day of changing fortunes. At the half way point
John Gray wasn't even in the top ten but over the closing stages he
rocketed back into contention and finished the day third ,just 12
seconds behind Wagner.
Gordon Boyd finished fourth, George Gauld was fifth after a slow
start, and Jimmy Paterson fulfilled expectations with his first
appearance in a competitive machine rounding off the top half dozen.
1, David Gillanders/Bob Wilson (Ford Escort Cosworth) 51 mins 16 secs;
2, Chris Wagner/Alan Stark (Audi 90 Quattro) 51:18; 3, John Gray/Fergus
Loudon (MG Metro 6R4) 51:30; 4, Gordon Boyd/Fred Bell (Ford Escort
Cosworth) 52:30; 5, George Gauld/Roy Campbell (Ford Escort Cosworth)

SEVEN years ago Keith Anderson could not tie his shoe laces without
getting out of breath. Yesterday, at the age of 37, he left the whole of
Scotland gasping in his wake as he claimed the national senior men's
cross-country title on the North Inch, Perth.
Anderson, on his Cambuslang debut, led his new club to a record eighth
successive team victory, ahead of the favoured Leslie Deans Racing Club,
who, disappointingly, did not stay to collect their medals.
The oldest winner since 1948, Anderson broke clear in the final mile,
finishing in 41min.08sec, 21 seconds clear of the defending champion,
Spango Valley's Chris Robison, with Cambuslang's Graeme Croll third.
Remarkably, Anderson had taken the British Universities' championship
seven days earlier, and this time he saw off a field which contained
three former champions -- Commonwealth Games finallist Robison, Olympic
steeplechase finallist Tom Hanlon, who dropped out for the second
successive year, and three-time champion Tom Murray, who placed fourth.
A mature student at Stafford University, but son of a Scottish father,
Anderson spent 15 years in Glasgow, and his schooldays at Smithycroft
school in Dennistoun. Two years ago he pointed out his nationality to
the Scottish Athletic Federation, but despite his credentials as a
former British fell-running champion, and significant road form, he was
never given a Scottish vest.
''I looked on myself as Scottish, but when England came along and
offered me international selection at 36, I thought I'd better grab the
chance,'' he said. ''It was a ridiculous situation. I'd have preferred
to be Scottish.''
The first six to finish are due to represent Scotland in the world
championship trial at Morpeth on March 5. A seventh will be chosen by
the selectors today. But Anderson cannot be among them.
Now there will be the unique situation of Anderson, a Scot, running
for England, and runner-up Robison, England-born, representing Scotland.
The 38-year-old John Robson, 1978 Commonwealth Games medallist at
1500m, ran outstandingly, sixth, for Racing Club, but is uncertain about
accepting a world trial place. ''I hate cross-country,'' said the man
once ranked fifth in the world at the event. ''They should try younger
guys.''
The extra place in the team of seven is likely to go to Robert Quinn,
who pulled out with a viral infection -- though Alan Puckrin, similarly
afflicted, has claims.
Cambuslang packed their six counting runners into the first 17 places.
Alex Robertson finished nineteenth for the Lanarkshire men, surely the
highest placed runner from a winning club not to feature in the medals.
And on a glorious day, they won the team title in every age group,
except under-20, in which they placed third.
''I remember as a boy being inspired by watching Lachie Stewart
winning at the Commonwealth Games,'' said Anderson, a former chef. ''But
I never even ran, far less gave a thought to winning a title which he
once held.
''I had trouble tieing my shoe laces when I was 30. That's when I
started running. My wife went on a diet, and I stepped on the scales. I
was 13[1/2]st, and it frightened me.''
Cambuslang gave up their place in the European Club's championships
which also took place yesterday -- a right earned by last year's
success. But club official Dave Cooney warned: ''We will not defend the
Scottish title next year if there is a fixture clash. We asked the
Scottish federation to do something about it, but they did not, and our
club lost out on the trip. It will not happen again.''
Vikki McPherson, the Commonwealth Games team captain from City of
Glasgow, won the women's title for the third time in four years, leading
her club to victory in the team event. Shettleston, the defending
champions, were third.
McPherson beat American exchange medical student Liz Riley, of Metro
Aberdeen, by 17 seconds, with last year's winner, Sue Ridley, third.
Accountant McPherson now hopes to make the British team for the world
event for the fourth successive year.

PAUL Weir's dream of a fight with ''Baby'' Jake Matlala for the World
Boxing Organisation flyweight championship lay in ruins in Pretoria on
Saturday night when the little South African lost his crown to Mexico's
Alberto Jiminez on an eighth-round stoppage.
Weir, the WBO light-flyweight champion and former straw-weight title
holder from Irvine, had his sights set on Matlala and a record-breaking
third world title, but as he watched the action along with his manager
Tommy Gilmour, all the plans were wrecked.
Matlala, who took the title from Weir's stablemate, Pat Clinton, gave
his usual gutsy effort, but the 34-year-old found the Mexican, nine
years his junior, too hot a handful. Jiminez comfortably soaked up heavy
pressure from the champion, then poured on plenty of his own.
The end, however, came in dramatic fashion. Midway through the eighth
round, Jiminez caught Matlala with a vicious right hook to the body and
followed up with a heavy combination to the head. The champion slumped
to one knee and the Californian referee immediately called a halt, much
to the anger of the capacity crowd.
It was later revealed that Matlala had been suffering from a
''stomache ailment'' and that a fortnight before the bout, he had been
in hospital for treatment.
Weir will, of course, retain his ambition of winning world titles at
three different weights, but instead of a showdown with Matlala, he will
now almost certainly concentrate on a defence of his light-fly title
within the next couple of months.
On the same bill as Matlala, Scots-born Gary Murray outpointed
London's Ojay Abrahams in a bizarre eight-rounder which saw Abrahams
open a gash under Murray's left eye with a head butt in the opening
stages. The Londoner, who did not win a round on any of the judges
scorecards, was down twice for counts of seven, and, in the fifth, when
he looked certain to be stopped, the bell signalling the end of the
round rang almost a minute early.
This was supposed to be a simple warm-up fight before Murray, who has
lived in South Africa since he was 16, meets Ireland's Eamonn Loughran
for the WBO welterweight title.
* COMMONWEALTH Games bantam gold medallist Paul Shepherd, from
Edinburgh, captains a depleted eight-man Scottish squad against England
at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London tonight, knowing it's 19 years
since our last success over the Auld Enemy. Scottish team:
Bantam: Shepherd, A Brennan (Barn). Feather: P Watson (Barn). Light: J
Coyle (Bannockburn). Light-welter: G Howatt (Lochee). Welter: C McNeil
(Springhill). Light-middle: J Gilhaney (Cleland), B Laidlaw (Cardenden).
* HENRY Maske, of Germany, retained his International Boxing
Federation (IBF) light-heavyweight title with a unanimous points
decision over Canada's Egerton Marcus in Frankfurt on Saturday.
* RASHID Johrie dispelled the well known myth that brains and brawn
don't mix when he completed the British and Scottish Universities
championship double within seven days.
Johrie, studying History at Strathclyde University, won the UK light
welterweight crown in London last week and on Saturday added the
domestic title to his list of honours at The Union, Glasgow. He defeated
Edinburgh psychology student Chris Byrne on a second-round stoppage,
having previously outpointed Glasgow's Roberto Bertoul. Results of other

SEVERIANO Ballesteros, having led from the first day until four holes
from the finish, lost the Canary Islands Open by one stroke to Jarmo
Sandelin after the little-known Swede had produced a miracle chip at the
fifteenth hole in Gran Canaria yesterday.
Sandelin, who is not even a household name in his native Stockholm,
had started the day two shots behind the Spaniard, fell six strokes
behind after only four holes, but had closed the gap to one when he
reached the 365-yard fifteenth.
Then, with Ballesteros recording a bogey 5 after driving into trees,
Sandelin produced his killer blow.
He had mis-hit his wedge to the green and was 60 feet from the flag in
two but then, to the astonishment and dismay of the pro-Spanish gallery,
the Swede chipped into the hole for a birdie 3 to take a one-shot lead.
He parred the last three to finish with a six-under aggregate of 282,
but Ballesteros, who had parred the sixteenth and seventeenth, still had
the chance of forcing a play-off when he splashed out of a bunker to
within six feet of the hole.
The Spaniard's putt drifted to the left of the hole, however, and the
27-year-old Sandelin had gained his first European Tour victory.
Sandelin, who had come into contention after shooting a course-record
66 in the third round, carries four wedges of different loft in his bag
and uses a longer-than-average driver.
After his win he said: ''It's unbelievable. I have beaten the great
hero in the last round. It's just great.
''I was six behind after I had double bogeyed the second and had
another at the fourth. But then I had three successive birdies and that
put me back in the race.''
Sandelin thought his birdie 2 at the difficult short eighth, where
Ballesteros had the first of three bogeys, was a key shot but he
admitted he had been very fortunate in chipping in at the fifteenth with
his No.9 iron.
''I had played a bad second shot and you have to be lucky. But this
was my week and that is why the ball went into the hole. I was also
lucky when Seve missed that last putt. I thought he would make it, and
he would have been very hard to beat in a play-off.''
Ballesteros, who had been hoping to gain his fifty-fourth European
Tour victory said: ''It's more difficult for me to win this event than
the US Masters. The greens were so difficult, but Sandelin did not make
any mistakes in the last 14 holes, so good luck to him.''
Paul Eales, who had finished 15 minutes earlier than Sandelin and
Ballesteros, earned joint second place when he birdied the last for 283.
Sweden's Anders Forsbrand also shot 71 to finish fourth on 284, with
Irishman Darren Clarke, German Sven Struver and Gary Emerson of
Salisbury joint fifth on 285.
Helensburgh-born Gary Orr was top Scot in joint eight place on
level-par 288 after a closing 74. He was four under par and three off
the pace with nine holes to play, but dropped four shots on his inward
nine. Two behind were fellow-Scots Brian Marchbank (72) and Paul Lawrie
(73).

RONNIE O'Sullivan won the Benson and Hedges Masters title at Wembley
Conference Centre yesterday, running out a 9-3 winner in the final
against fellow snooker prodigy John Higgins.
The 19-year-olds were the youngest players to contest a major final
but it was the Essex youngster who headed towards the #120,000 winner's
cheque by taking a 5-2 first-session lead.
Higgins, who had wins of 5-0 and 5-4 over his rival this season,
pottedfrom brown to pink to win the opening frame. He was set for a 2-0
lead when, having made a 48 break, he led 50-16, but the wild-card entry
from Wishaw suffered a ''kick'' and jawed a red to a middle pocket.
''That was the turning point,'' he said. ''When Ronnie gets on a role,
he's the hardest player in the world to stop. He wins frames so
quickly.''
O'Sullivan put together a 47 clearance to the pink, including a
spectacular shot from brown to blue, and thus embarked on a five-frame
sequence, with further breaks of 68, 53, and 82.
In an error-strewn seventh frame Higgins constructed a run of 73 to
end the session at 2-5 but last night O'Sullivan had runs of 55, 41, and
46 as he moved to 7-2. The Scot compiled a 91 in the tenth frame but
breaks of 33, 34, and 57 in the following two frames earned O'Sullivan
his fourth professional title.
O'Sullivan, who takes over from five-times Masters champion Stephen
Hendry as the youngest winner of the event, said: ''I'm still not happy
with my game.
''I hope people don't get offended with what I say but I'm still
searching for the missing part and, when it arrives I think I can win
tournament after tournament.
''I know I can win the world title easily. For me there's Hendry,
John, and myself, and the rest are struggling.''
The Scot is the first wild-card to reach the Masters final and was
consoled by a #63,000 cheque as runner-up.

TWO things of consequence have reared their heads this weekend. The
first I found out about at the Antrim Gala dinner in Northern Ireland.
I sat beside Reg Reilly, the Ulster representative on the IRFB. ''It's
a tragedy, isn't it,'' he said, ''that the Irish have called off from
next season's Inter Provincial Championship.''
''You what?'' I stammered. This competition is the flagship of the way
ahead, a bridge between club and district.
''You didn't know?'' he went on. ''The IRFB don't think it's
worthwhile, and so the thing is off. I think it's a tragedy. We will
contact the Scottish Districts to try to play some friendly games.''
Fraser Livingston, Secretary of the Glasgow and District Union,
confirmed the news yesterday, which is a big blow to Jim Telfer's plans
for Scottish rugby's future.
''It's not official, but, yes, we have been informed that the Irish do
not want to be part of the full-scale series of matches,'' Livingston
said.
''However, like Ulster, we are keen to keep playing the Irish
regularly at District level. We think it would be good for both of us.''
I understand that Glasgow are considering the possibility of a
Friendship Cup with Ulster, a move that would delight the Northern
Irish. Reilly said: ''We would welcome that.''
Andy Little, the Glasgow representative on the SRU, said: ''I'm sad it
has come to this. The players liked the games, and already the Irish
Provinces have contacted some of our Districts.
''We thought it was valuable; the negative side came from high up the
Irish tree.''
This is huge news. But let me give them a tip. If the Districts are to
go ahead with some form of competition with the Irish, then make sure
two things happen.
First, get a sponsor. A Murphy's Cup or similar between Ulster and
Glasgow would make a big difference from some unimportant game in front
of nobody. Second, give the thing a tangible prize, or it will never
take off.
THE second bit of news came with a little video package delivered to
suburban Jordanhill on Saturday morning. It contained an uncut version
of Thursday's BBC Scotland's documentary For Love and Money? -- which
highlights the differences between Melrose and the Toulouse club in
France -- as part of the 700-year Auld Alliance.
Melrose is run by a body of people who do it for nothing, as do the
players. Stade Toulousain, winners of France's championship last season,
have a full-time staff, and run a work experience scheme with players
who are tied to one of the sponsors.
The bombshell of the piece is that one of their senior players,
Patrick Soula, is to be pictured on camera saying: ''I don't mind
telling you that an average player gets 5000 francs a month (#625) plus
a match win bonus of about 1000 francs (#125).
''All the clubs in the First Division and below get payment. We really
count on match bonuses.''
Toulouse club president, Rene Bouscatel, says: ''We have a fixed
monthly amount which covers all the time the players lose through rugby,
and a bonus scheme based on match results.''
Bouscatel goes on: ''There are certain players at certain clubs who
are earning 'way beyond what can be considered appropriate amateur
status.''
In many ways the documentary is an old chew of every accusation ever
levelled at the different approaches from different countries when it
comes to professionalism.
It combines ex-players whingeing about how they weren't paid in their
day to clever cutting to make the SRU look quite silly.
What it does, emphatically too, is prove, on camera and in interview,
that the French admit paying their players healthy money at club level.
It raises a question. As you know, it's against the rules. The French
admit on telly to having broken the rules. Therefore they shouldn't be
allowed to play. What do we do now? Call off from Saturday's game? I
think, chaps, that we should.  Answers on a postcard please . . .

San Diego
PETER Jacobsen almost certainly booked a place for himself in the 1995
US Ryder Cup side to defend the trophy in upstate New York in the autumn
when he won the Buick Invitational by four strokes with a final 68 on
the 7000-yard Torrey Pines South course in California yesterday.
It was Jacobsen's second win in succession, for he triumphed
unexpectedly at Pebble Beach last week -- after not having won a
tournament since the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in 1990.
The 41-year-old professional, who has been noted more for his
television commentating than his stroke play in the last few seasons,
again played some inspired golf, albeit in a weaker field this week, to
leave a group of four, who included Mark Calcaveccia and Hal Sutton,
gasping behind him.
He became the first professional to win two events in a row since
1993, when Zimbabwean Nick Price, and later South African David Frost,
did so.
In contrast to many professionals, who take their victories either too
seriously or too tearfully, Jacobsen is a cheery fellow who not only
impersonates many of the world stars with an uncanny touch, but runs his
own television company as well as occasionally joining other players in
a Pop group called, Jake Trout and the Flounders.
He made the crowd roar with laughter after he had birdied the last
hole, as he had done at Pebble Beach.
Jacobsen threw the ball high into the stands and, then picking up his
wife, stalked purposefully towards the nearby lake as if to dunk her, or
both of them, into the water.
Something Mrs Jacobsen whispered in his ear made him desist, but he
carried her off the green like a proud bridegroom hoisting a pretty
bride over the threshold.
Nick Faldo, who missed the cut by a single stroke on Friday night --
he missed several tap-in putts in another 71 -- and then flew off
directly to Florida to have a fortnight's break with his family, could
well have something to learn from Jacobsen's attitude.
But the Briton has his mind full with his putting problems at the
moment. Final scores:
269 -- P Jacobsen 68, 69, 68, 68.
273 -- M Calcaveccia 71, 67, 67, 68; H Sutton 67, 69, #8, 69; K
Triplett 69, 69, 66, 69; M Hulbert 70, 65, 70, 68.
275 -- D Pohl 65, 74, 66, 70; D Pruitt 69, 70, 68, 68.
276 -- D Ogrin 66, 69, 74, 67; N Henke 68, 66, 73, 69; J Huston 69,
71, 67, 69; B Chamblee 66, 66, 74, 70.
Others included:
277 -- C Stadler 69, 68, 72, 69; D Love 69, 71, 72, 65.
278 -- P Mickelson 65, 69, 75, 69; C Beck 70, 70, 71, 67; P Stewart
66, 70, 67, 72.
281 -- T Kite 75, 66, 67, 73; J Parnevik (Sweden) 72, 64, 74, 71.
Failed to qualify: 142 -- N Faldo (England) 71, 71. 146 -- D Feherty
(N Ireland) 69, 77.

JOHN Regis accepted the sponsor's flowers, reward for 200 metres
victory in Britain's athletics international against France on Saturday,
but he awarded no bouquets himself.
Despite slicing seven hundredths of a second from his own Scottish
all-comers' record, with a time of 20.67sec, he gave none of the credit
to the Kelvin Hall track.
''The banking is too steep for speed,'' he growled from behind a new
Fu Manchu-style beard. ''It's hard to attack the bends, hard to get your
feet.'' But for one who dislikes the surface, he is adept at burying his
prejudices, for he has flourished in Glasgow.
His performance at the Interflora international was his fourth
Scottish all-comers' best at this distance in four years (plus a share
of the world 4 x 200m record, in 1991) and it helped Britain to overall
victory by 155 points to 122.
But despite breath-taking wins by stars such as Linford Christie,
Colin Jackson, and Tom McKean, it is Regis who warms the heart most this
winter. For each of the others declines to run the World Indoor
championships next month in Barcelona, whereas Regis has the date
indelibly in his diary. He is convinced he is in shape to break the
world record, hence his up-tight jibes at Glasgow's bends.
He believes he can dominate the event indoors and out this year, and
that the world mark can be his in Lievin, France, next weekend, when he
faces Commonwealth champion, Frankie Fredericks.
But he might have been less effusive had he realised that the time of
20.47, which he ran last weekend, and which he believes is a British
record, cannot be ratified. There were just two men in the race, and
British rules (141, 17) require a minimum of three runners.
His latest record was just one of eight established on Saturday,
although five were set in the pole vault alone. Catherine Oberson and
Kate Staples nudged up the all-comers' mark five times before Gladiator
Staples won at 3.60 metres, her twenty-seventh record in the event.
As Jackson held off Tony Jarrett in 7.39, the world's fastest time of
the year, Jarrett equalled his English native best with 7.44. Jackson,
who is off to train in Australia tomorrow, clocked 7.39 yesterday in
Karlsruhe, but suffered slight hamstring damage.
His coach, Malcolm Arnold, said: ''Colin is running incredibly well --
less than a tenth of a second from the world record, yet he is still
lifting heavy weights three times a week.''
Christie, who won the 60m in 6.56, also confessed to be working with
heavier weights than in recent winters, and indicated progress, even at
34, which suggests that the world record which would crown his career,
is within his grasp.
''I'm lighter than last year, but lifting heavier weights,'' he said.
''That means I am stronger, and that helps you race faster. My coach,
Ron Roddan, has his ideas and I have mine. I tend to keep mine to
myself. But I don't discount going faster.''
The UK selectors' deficiencies were exposed by Arbroath 1500m runner
Ian Campbell. Omitted from the team, despite being UK fastest this year
by more than five seconds, he ran as a guest, smashing his own Scottish
native record by almost two seconds with 3min 43.53sec.
He was the only man to challenge Eric Dubus, fourth in last year's
European outdoor championships, but the effort drained him, and he was
nailed on the line by the UK No.1, Ian Grime, who had been content to
lie back. Clydesdale's Grant Graham finished fourth but slashed four
seconds from his best.
Despite maintaining this winter's 100% record, McKean remains adamant
that he will not defend his world crown. He survived a blistering
challenge from Martin Steele, and also buried last summer's leading
outdoor Briton, Craig Winrow, winning in 1-48.72.
Mel Neef preserved her unbeaten indoor 400m record -- she has not lost
on the boards since taking up the event last year. But she was pushed
all the way, winning by just 0.04sec, in 53.67.
She withdrew from the relay, with a tight calf muscle, but is
confident she will be right within days. She races Sally Gunnell a week
on Saturday, and whatever the outcome can be sure of a world team place.
Troon's Brian Whittle, beaten into third in the men's individual 400m
by teenage AAA champion Mark Hylton, came back to anchor the relay team
to victory. Winners and leading Britons:

TOMMY Burns has been to the place where real football players are made
and the Celtic manager, who is determined to glean as much knowledge as
possible before laying the foundations which he believes will make his
club a power again, intends now to speak with the one of the all-time
greats, Johan Cruyff.
Burns is not ashamed to admit he will absorb information or advice
from as many experienced managers and coaches as will give him their
time, and Barcelona will be one of the next stops on Burns' journey
towards greater footballing awareness.
Cruyff often can give the impression of being aloof and distant, but
that might simply be a side-effect of his greatness. He is still
regarded as the absolute genius of modern football and sometimes the
truly gifted can become weary of the ways of lesser people. His kind
often operate on a different frequency and tend to become slightly
insular.
It isn't that Cruyff is refusing to allow opponents a window on his
mind, but after a while he may have arrived at the concusion that there
is no further point in preaching a gospel which floats over the heads of
others because they are either unwilling or unable to comprehend the
message.
Burns' thirst for knowledge and understanding of the various
approaches to football will be accommodated by the former Dutch
internationalist, who has been told of the Celtic manager's interest in
his philosphy. If the schedules of both managers can accommodate a
meeting -- Cruyff's Catalan side malfunctioned badly on Saturday,
slumping to a 5-0 defeat by Racing Santander -- then Barcelona's leader
will meet Celtic's young manager, who only last week travelled to Ajax.
where Cruyff began the career which thrilled and inspired millions.
He was a player of natural ability and intelligence who performed with
balletic grace. Cruyff displayed an awareness way above the normal, the
sharpness of thought and clarity of vision which all of the world's best
players possessed.
Indeed, he became the finest example of the football modernists who
were the products of coaches like the Dutch innovator, Rinus Michels, a
deep thinker and schemer, who first presented total football in all its
glory to the world in the 70s.
The game should be forever grateful to the Dutch, who have never
stopped developing and refining their product, which is the reason their
players are in demand. A manager simply knows that when he buys a Dutch
footballer he is receiving someone whose understanding is widespread.
Dutch players tend to think a few moves ahead and they see the game as a
complete picture rather than an unmade jigsaw puzzle.
They also have greater technique than players from most other
countries and especially Britain, and Burns deserves credit for wishing
to examine closely what it is the Dutch are doing with their children.
Now he wants to go to the master himself.
Expansion, the need to question and experiment, is another attribute
of Holland's footballing people. They are always seeking ways of being
more expressive and are unafraid to stretch the boundaries of
convention. It was inevitable Burns would soon head in the direction of
the Dutch in search of knowledge.
A few years ago, after I had travelled to Holland to put together a
documentary for BBC on the differences between football as we know it
here and the European game, Burns, who was just starting out on his
managerial career with Kilmarnock, telephoned to remark on the
programme's value. The parts filmed at Ajax and one of the Dutch FA's
coaching schools intrigued him and it can be assumed safely that the
development programme he intends instituting at Celtic Park will be
influenced greatly by what he has learned in Holland.
Perhaps Cruyff's methods also can be adapted to suit and, if nothing
else, Burns is determined to give his club a youth development system
which will be the envy of everyone on this island. Having gone Dutch, he
is bound to be considering the possibility of introducing a scheme which
combines a youth's footballing needs with his education, something they
have been doing for years in the Netherlands.
Of course, Burns cannot afford to ignore the immediate problems
because supporters are concerned with what is happening now. They want
to see improvement on a Saturday afternoon and their desperation to
welcome a trophy to Celtic Park has been made even more acute because of
the team's failure in the Coca-Cola Cup final last November, when they
were beaten by Raith Rovers after a penalty shoot-out.
The Scottish Cup is the only shiny thing they can win this season and
if the players equal the resolve and boldness being displayed by Burns,
it would be foolish to write them off. On Saturday the manager took the
decision to drop his captain Paul McStay because he felt his style of
play was not appropriate.
Burns wanted to bring 20-year-old Brian McLaughlin back into the first
team and someone had to drop out. McStay discovered that Celtic's
manager will sacrifice anyone to find the correct playing system, one
which can add another dimension to the team's style.
Cruyff, who has dropped the player voted No.1 in the world, Romario,
and Bulgarian star Hristo Stoichkov in search of the perfect balance,
would have approved.
' Celtic seek a youth development system everyone will envy. '

THE capitulation of the opposition, allied to their own brilliance,
saw Edinburgh Ladies walk off with the women's Indoor Hockey League
title for the third successive year at the McTaggart Centre in Dundee on
Saturday, giving them the league and cup double for the first time and
setting them up nicely for the finals next weekend of the European club
championship.
Western Klick Photopoint and Bonagrass Grove simplified Edinburgh's
task by playing out a 3-3 draw in the penultimate match of the
championship, so Edinburgh had retained their crown before their final
match.
Edinburgh began the day displaying the form of champions, beating
Menzieshill 10-1 with Pauline Robertson emerging as their top scorer
with a hat trick. This performance clearly intimidated their rivals for
Western threw in the towel against Grove.
After getting back on level terms through a corner conversion by Mags
Barbour two minutes from time, goalkeeper Tracy Robb was brought back
for the closing stages, thus settling for a draw.
They obviously felt Edinburgh were beyond their reach and so it turned
out for the capital girls beat Hyndland 10-2 to complete their programme
with maximum points to finish three points clear of Western and Grove.
On this form Edinburgh can look with confidence to the Euro finals in
Russelsheim, Germany, where they could well improve on the bronze medals
won last year.
But Western, despite being relegated to a poor second, have a much
brighter future than many might envisage.
Their second string, playing as Clydesdale, won Pool B and will
compete in the top flight next season, creating a much broader base for
Western in the future. They secured their elevation by beating Royal
High Gymnasts 4-3 in the deciding game.
Indoor hockey is renowned for producing close finishes to games but
never before has a division of the league seen the top two sides so
easily matched as in Division Four on Saturday, at the end of their
campaign. Pender Uddingston and Hillhead finished equal on both points
and goal difference but Uddingston, having scored 118 goals to
Hillhead's 113, took the silverware. Results:

PLAYERS swapped shirts and fans were unusually subdued as Italy's
Serie A resumed normal service yesterday, two weeks after the murder of
a Genoa fan provoked the suspension of all national sport.
At grounds throughout the country, teams took the field wearing their
opponents' jerseys before their captains read a special message calling
on fans to unite against violence.
''Soccer should unite and not divide us,'' said Sampdoria captain
Roberto Mancini at the Ferraris stadium in Genoa, where 24-year-old
Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death on January 29.
At most grounds, fans displayed banners renouncing hooliganism, while
Genoa and Padua supporters stayed away from their teams' away fixtures
in Florence and Parma respectively.
Once back in their own playing strip, Juventus maintained their
three-point lead at the top of the table with a hard-fought 2-0 win at
Bari.

GLASGOW Mid Argyll's south division one shinty championship hopes
almost certainly perished on a rain-sodden Mossfield Park in Oban when
they went down 3-0 to reigning champions Oban Camanachd.
The 3-0 final scoreline flattered the champions. An early goal from
Stephen Jamieson and then a second against the run of play from David
Devine early in the second half, put them in an unassailable position.
Gus Campbell's third strike with four minutes remaining gave Camanachd
a comfortable two points which now leave them eight ahead of Mid Argyll
and Kyles, who have a game in hand.
Another weekend of dismal weather brought widespread postponements.
Two Glenmorangie Sutherland cup ties survived, however, and Fort
William made the most of their chance to complete a junior and senior
cup double when they inflicted a surprisingly easy defeat on Lochside
Rovers.
Rovers took an early lead through Cameron MacEachain, but an Ian
Kennedy double before half-time put Fort back in front. Andy Reid
provided a third to put Fort in the semi-finals.
The other tie was also in rain-drenched Lochaber with Kilmallie's
veterans proving too much for south opponents Strachur.
The two north sides now await the outcome of the two postponed ties
which are being re-scheduled for this Saturday. All four semi-finalists
could come from the north. Favourites Kingussie are liable to be too
strong for Oban Celtic and Beauly have home advantage against Inveraray.
Results:
Glenmorangie Sutherland Cup. Third round -- Fort William 3, Lochside
Rovers 1; Kilmallie 5, Strachur 0.
North. Marine Harvest league. Division three -- Skye 5, Glenurquhart
2. Division four -- Lochaber 4, Kincraig 0.
South. Marine Harvest league. Division one -- Oban Camanachd 3,
Glasgow Mid-Argyll 0. Division two -- Edinburgh University 0, Tayforth

THE contrast between the men's and women's finals yesterday in the
Scottish junior championships in Kilmarnock could not have been greater.
The lead changed five times in the women's event before Forfar's Julia
Ewart beat Catherine Wright (Stranraer) 10-8, while in the men's final,
six ends were blanked before Lockerbie's Tom Brewster beat defending
champion and club-mate Craig Wilson 3-2.
Ewart started the final well with a single on the first end, Wright
followed that with a 3, but the Forfar team came back with another
three.
At the sixth, Ewart scored 2to take a 7-4 lead that looked decisive,
but Wright's side fought back with 2s at the seventh and eighth ends to
regain the lead at 8-7.
Ewart's team showed fighting quality in the last two ends, scoring a
single at the ninth and then at the next to gain victory.
Tom Brewster set the tone for the men's final, choosing to blank the
first four ends. Brewster's patience paid off in the fifth when Craig
Wilson, who was trying to win the title for the third successive time,
was too heavy with his last stone, leaving Brewster with a
straightforward draw to score 2 and put his team in front.
Wilson then responded with a single at the next end. In the seventh,
Brewster returned to his blanking tactics, but in the next end, Wilson
stole another single to level the game at 2-2.
In the ninth end, Wilson had a stone at the rear of the house which
looked well guarded, but a well judged shot by Brewster took it out.
Following this, a hit-and-roll by Brewster blanked the end to let him
retain the last-stone advantage for the tenth end.
Wilson built up the head in the tenth and lay three with skip stones
still to be played. However, Craig Wilson's attempt to restore his front
guard with his last stone was too wide and too strong, leaving Brewster
with a double take-out for the title.
In this pressure situation, Brewster's stone was good enough to give
him one shot and the game at 3-2.

STRIKER Romario's first competitive game since returning to Brazilian
soccer from Spain turned into a flop yesterday when he failed to score
and was marked out of the game in Flamengo's drew 0-0 with Fluminense.
A crowd of nearly 99,000 turned out to watch Romario's proper debut
for Flamengo, whom he joined from Barcelona last month, in the Rio de
Janeiro championship game at the Maracana stadium.
But despite a delirious welcome from Flamengo fans, who threw ticker
tape and fireworks on to the pitch when Romario took the field, the
striker was outwitted and outmarked by his marker, Fluminense central
defender Lima.
Romario had only one shot on target in the 90 minutes and looked weary
and short of pace. During the first half, a fan ran on to the pitch and
hugged him. Romario led the fan to the touchline, where he was taken
away by police.
The Brazilian star had previously played in two friendly matches for
Flamengo but did not score in either game.

TOP seed Andre Agassi and No.2 Michael Chang, who have been playing
each other since childhood, won through to the final of the San Jose
Open in California.
World No.2 Agassi continued his assault on the top spot with a 6-4,
6-2 semi-final win over fifth seed MaliVai Washington, while Chang,
ranked sixth in the world, reeled off five games from 1-4 in the third

''He's the fastest guy on the tour and covers a lot of real estate out
here. He's not going to give you anything and that's always tough. But I
feel I have a little bit more firepower from the ground.''
* THIRD seed Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria, a last-minute entry into

* WEST Indies inflicted the heaviest defeat ever on New Zealand when
they won the second Test by an innings and 322 runs before lunch on the
fourth day early today in Wellington, winning the two-match series 1-0.
The first Test was drawn.
Captain Courtney Walsh destroyed New Zealand's first innings yesterday
with his best Test performance of seven for 37, making the Kiwis follow
on a massive 444 runs behind.
Walsh then took six for 18 in the second innings and, not
surprisingly, was named man of the match after match figures of 13 for
55.
West Indies batsman Brian Lara, who hit 147 on Friday, is to undergo
eye surgery.
During his innings he was hit in the face by a bouncer from Danny
Morrison. Scores:
West Indies 660 for five, decl (B Lara 147, J Adams 151, J Murray 101
n.o.); New Zealand 216 (D Murray 52, S Fleming 47; C Walsh 7-37) and 122
(Walsh 6-18).

MICHAEL Atherton has defended the management of the England team in
the wake of the disappointing Ashes tour.
The England captain spoke of a lack of unity after the fifth Test
defeat in Perth and, earlier in the tour, appeared to hint at
differences of opinion with chairman of selectors Raymond Illingworth.
But speaking on BBC Breakfast with Frost yesterday, Atherton insisted
he was happy with the current set-up.
''I think the management structure's fine,'' he said. ''I'm very happy
with my role in selection at the moment.
''We have a five-man selection committee on which I have a vote, and
I'm perfectly happy with that.''
Atherton said he was misquoted over claims that he wanted a greater
say in selection, although he repeated his call for younger selectors.
Meanwhile, the bitter taste of defeat, their first in India, should
re-focus Allan Wells' England A team for the final fortnight of their
highly successful tour.
That is the opinion of both captain Wells and team manager Phil Neale
in the wake of Saturday's controversial six-run defeat in the opening
one-day international against India A at Indore.
Wells's side felt harshly treated by the umpires, who imposed a
one-over penalty for England's failure to bowl their 50 overs inside the
prescribed three-and-a-half-hour limit.
The umpires' decision meant England had left themselves only 49 overs
in which to score 202.
In the end, despite a brave chase, the final over began with 14 runs
still wanted, and that proved too tall an order for Paul Nixon and last
man Richard Stemp.
* WEST Indies captain Courtney Walsh destroyed New Zealand's first
innings with his best Test performance of seven for 37 and made the
Kiwis follow on a massive 444 runs behind on the third day of the second
Test in Wellington yesterday.
Walsh then bowled Young for a duck in the first over of the second
innings to collect his 250th Test wicket.
New Zealand got into even deeper trouble when Benjamin got Jones lbw
without scoring in the second over and Curtly Ambrose trapped Rutherford
lbw for four soon after.
By the close, the Kiwis were reeling at 52 for three and staring at
the most comprehensive defeat in their history.
West Indies batsman Brian Lara, who hit 147 on Friday, is to undergo
eye surgery. During his innings he was hit in the face by a bouncer from
Danny Morrison.

Boroughmuir 8, Edinburgh Academicals 9
SINGING in the rain were the Academicals; up the creek without a
paddle were the boys of Boroughmuir, their championship hopes swept away
in the tide. Yet how these differing emotions were realised has to be
one of the great mysteries of the season.
Let's not mess about -- Boroughmuir should have won. They had
possession galore thanks to the spring-heeled antics of Darren Burns and
Paul Jennings at the line-out. They had the smartest back on display in
Sean Lineen, the most deadly finisher in Derek Stark.
Yet the home team were not robbed. They stole the game from
themselves.
On a day when ducks scurried for shelter, Boroughmuir wanted to play
it wide. Occasionally they even shipped the ball about in their own 22.
This was akin to turkeys voting for Christmas.
The spectating Scotland 'A' coach Hugh Campbell mildly observed that
these tactics were ''a little naive.'' Jeremy Richardson, the Scotland
and Academicals lock, put an astute finger on it. ''They had no plan
B.''
The visitors, welcoming the deluge like farmers at the end of a
drought, had little time for such extravagances. They knew exactly what
they were trying to do and fly-half Brian Hay-Smith did it.
His left foot must have been tired as he punted with it so often,
turning the Boroughmuir defence again and again. It was repetitive, not
very spectacular -- and utterly effective. He was the man of the match
by a mile.
He needed some help, of course, and that was principally provided by
David McIvor and his beavering pack, for whom such conditions were sent
by the Gods. McIvor has fallen from international grace since the South
African debacle yet one feels he should be around somewhere just in case
the weather turns foul.
Rob Hoole and Martin Waite impressed me, the former a genuine
open-side flanker. ''Nailing them in the first tackle was important and
we did that well,'' said Richardson.
They did, indeed, and managed to pinch a lot of ruck ball in the
process. On the couple of occasions the ball went beyond Hay-Smith,
Chris Simmers was ready to show he possessed a break.
Peter Wright, with Paris in his sights, had a storming match for
Boroughmuir. He may have looked like a panda but his relish to have the
ball in his hands was refreshing.
But I was still puzzled why the home side did not change the orders of
the day. ''We lacked,'' commented Iwan Tukalo, one of the 'Muir injured
men, ''a bit of experience in the midfield.'' They missed him, all
right, and scrum-half Mike Hall even more.
Handling in a ruck provided the opportunity for Hay-Smith to kick the
opening penalty. Offside at the line-out brought the second.
In 20 minutes, however, we were served up a peach of a try. Home full
back Nick Mardon entered the line and lobbed a high pass to Stark.
The international winger, whose recall papers cannot be long in
arriving, caught the ball one-handed then cut inside, wrong-footing the
entire defence. He gave to Lineen who, according to Stark, ''has lost a
yard in pace''. Old Sean has not been told this; he skipped outside one
man and side-stepped another en route to the touchdown.
Hay-Smith resumed his goal-kicking duties on the half-hour before the
home forwards, Grant Wilson to the fore, set up a penalty chance for
Bryan Easson. He kicked it but not much else went well for the lad.
The second half was barren of scores. Lineen and Stark had collected
knocks by now and Boroughmuir were stuck in the swamp.
Tukalo told me he might be fit to play in a couple of weeks. ''But is
there much point?'' he posed. Academicals, however, have still much to
play for -- they want to make absolutely certain of a top division spot
next season.
Boroughmuir -- N Marden; D A Stark, S R P Lineen, D Laird, A Millar; B
R Easson, A Knight; G D Wilson, N Dickson, P H Wright, P T Jennings, D G
Burns, G J Drummond, S J Reid, C McFarlane.

AS a rugby writer -- even as a recently qualified one -- I am often
asked the question, will even spasmodic exposure to Rugby League damage
the health?
Usually the query comes at those cosy supper parties which those of us
in colleague James Traynor's ''rugby mob'' of lawyers, bankers, teachers
and accountants so much enjoy.
Whenever the question is posed I invariably answer that, like all
things, Rugby League taken in moderation will do little harm. I cannot
bring myself to go quite so far as Des Seabrook of the Lancashire rugby
union club Orrell, who observed that Rugby League was a simple game for
simple minds.
In rugby union there are any number of individual contests taking
place within the confines of a match. There are the scrummage front
rows. Which of them will come out on top in what remains one of the true
gladiatorial, head-to-head confontations in sport? There are the locks
who have their own personal duel in the lineout. Which of the opposing
scrumhalves will win the jousting that takes place at the base of the
scrummage? The back-rows, too, have their own private battles.
In the threequarter-line and on the wings there are one-on-one and
unit confrontations, and there can be few grander sights in sport than
that of a fullback bravely fielding opposition bombs or intruding into a
threequarter attack.
Undoubtedly, rugby union has become more sterile in recent years. But
what ball-game hasn't? The Andy Irvines and Jim Renwicks of the rugby
world are given scant opportunity in which to set the game alight these
days. But Union still has so much more to offer in the way of cranial
subtlety than the crash-bang-wallop of League.
The relative merits of League and Union take on a special significance
this year. It is 100 years since the great schism which saw the Northern
Union formed amid the bitter recriminations over ''broken-time
payments.''
All of which, with Union players currently cashing in on their
celebrity status and international players entitled to #40-a-day
''broken-time'' payments when on duty for their countries, is quite
risible.
Rugby League, rightly, looks on askance as global stars of the
''amateur'' Union game like David Campese of Australia seem to do quite
nicely out of their year-round endeavours.
Just the other week, for virtually the first time in a century, the
rugby league top brass, in the form of chief executive Maurice Lyndsay,
met the union International Board chairman Vernon Pugh. Cosy, but don't
hold your breath waiting for the great rapprochement communique. We
hear, too, that League is looking to Scoland with expansionist thoughts
in mind.
Count me out. Rugby Union has its faults but by comparison Rugby
League, with its ersatz scrummages, lack of lineouts, rucks, mauls and
its flanker-free zones is simple fare indeed. Maybe Seabrook had a
point.

Heriot's FP 9, Watsonians 15
WATSONIANS kept their title hopes burning bright amid the glaur and
gloom of a hopelessly mis-named Goldenacre, but they were made to work
for the right to maintain the challenge on Stirling County, especially
in the last quarter, when Heriot's heavier pack drove with telling, but
ultimately fruitless, effect.
The Myresiders remain just two points behind Stirling with just a
couple of games still to play. But the Bridgehaugh club, aiming for
their first championship in its 50-year history, has a postponed game in
hand, and Saturday's defeat of Boroughmuir by Edinburgh Academicals has
effectively turned the McEwan's 70/- title chase into a two-horse
affair.
Boroughmuir, though, still have a telling hand to play and their
encounter with Stirling at Bridgehaugh on Saturday week will be one of
the most enthralling clashes of the season.
On Saturday, Watsonians were without Gavin Hastings. The Scotland full
back had been advised to rest his war-weary back in advance of the Five
Nations' Championship trip to Paris. But even without him 'Sonians were
able to rise above the miserable conditions and score two tries to
Heriot's none.
Watsonians took the lead after 17 minutes following a series of drives
by the pack. The monsoon conditions, which contributed to a high
turnover rate, threatened to work to their disadvantage when Heriot's
winger Harry Gilmour seemed likely to break away from deep inside his
own half, but he was recalled for an off-side offence, and Duncan Hodge
made light work of a tricky penalty attempt.
Peter Hewitt kicked Heriot's back on level terms a short while later
with a penalty effort, and on the half-hour mark he put the home side
into the lead with a second successful penalty.
Three minutes later Watsonians' eager threequarters flew in the face
of muddy convention by spreading the ball wide, and Hodge, Henderson and
Kerr each played a part before Graeme Ingles squeezed over for a try at
the left corner flag.
Honours had been relatively even in a rain-soaked first half but, on
the stroke of half-time, Watsonians landed a psychologically significant
blow when Hodge went over for a short-range try, the ball having been
popped up by Weston from a ruck on the Heriot's line. He made it 15-6 at
the interval with the conversion of his own try.
Heriot's opted for a change of tactics at the start of the second
half. The conditions had negated earlier plans for their back-row, led
by Graham Dall, to play a leading role, and they opted instead for a
short-yardage game in which Scotland hooker Kenny Milne came into his
own.
After six minutes the new game plan almost paid dividends, when the
unmarked Peter Hewitt was handed a copper-bottomed scoring chance, but
the unforced error of a knock-on merely left the Heriot's winger staring
accusingly at his hands.
Hodge missed with a penalty attempt five minutes later, and for
virtually 20 minutes Watsonians were never out of the Heriot's half.
However, territorial domination was not turned into points and for the
final 20 minutes Watsonians were forced to weather not just the storm
but a fusillade of Heriot's raids on their line.
Gordon Lawrie was recalled by the referee for obstruction as he seemed
certain to score and Andy McRobbie was denied a try only by heroic cover
tackling at the corner flag.
Hewitt kicked his third penalty goal 10 minutes from the end, and
thereafter Watsonians were forced to endure a major onslaught. Three
times within as many minutes the home side eschewed penalty awards on
the visitors' line as they opted to scrummage for the try, and three
times Watsonians kept their line and their championship aspirations
intact.
Later, Watsonians coach Peter Gallagher praised his side for the
manner in which they had absorbed Heriot's last quarter push. ''They
made things very difficult for us with their driving around rucks and
mauls. They sucked us in and denied us the opportunities to play the
expansive game that we were after even in the conditions,'' he said.
The absent Hastings is a strong advocate of summer rugby and
Saturday's proceedings lent soggy weight to his case. Gallagher agrees:
''Sometimes it was so muddy that it was difficult for the players to
recognise each other. I've never seen Goldenacre looking so bad. There's
certainly a case to be made for fine weather rugby.''
In so far as Watsonians's title hopes are concerned, and with West of
Scotland and Dundee HS FP still to come, Gallagher is confident that his
side can take Stirling to the wire. ''It's still there to play for and
the challenge is still on,'' he declared.
Heriot's FP -- C R Aitken; H R Gilmour, A R McRobbie, G H Lawrie, P J
Hewitt; I C Glasgow, D Fowler; J Bryce, K S Milne, S W Paul, G Miller, C
Humphries, S Elliot, G A R Simpson, G F Dall. Replacement -- P Meadows

GHK 17, Hawick 17
''THAT was robbery -- and we were the bandits.'' Hawick coach Bill
Murray could not have been more honest in his assessment of the dramatic
draw at Old Anniesland.
Hawick were 17-6 behind after 50 minutes but a minute into injury time
got a try that levelled the scores and left both clubs still teetering
on the fringe of next season's eight-team Premier Division.
Murray continued: ''We looked dead and buried but all credit to the
lads, they kept plugging away, and GHK made the simple errors we had
committed in the first half and we cashed in.''
Brian Gilbert, the GHK coach, more or less reiterated those sentiments
by saying: ''I think we took our foot off the accelerator a bit early.
Scott Welsh's conversion attempt to win the match was not so very far
off target. If it had gone over there would have been a few suicides
around here.''
Even when Welsh put Hawick ahead with a seventh minute penalty, GHK
always looked the more dangerous and leapt into the lead three minutes
later when awarded a penalty try after Peterson was impeded after
charging down a clearance kick. George Breckenridge converted but Welsh
pulled back three points with a penalty.
Further power play by GHK's pack put Alan Watt over to give his side a
12-6 interval lead.
GHK began where they left off and Iain McDiarmid plunged over but
there ended the GHK dominance and Hawick clawed back with two Welsh
penalties and that dramatic injury time try from Cameron Murray.
GHK -- G Breckenridge; G Agnew, T Sanderson, I McDiarmid, G Hawkes; S
Hirini, C Little; A Watt, G Peterson, G MacIlwham, D Mellor, K Wilson, W
Malcolm, C Brown, M Wallace. Replacement -- M Blackie (for Peterson,
59min).
Hawick -- G Oliver; C Murray, D Grant, T Stanger, G Sharp; S Welsh, K
Reid; M Russell, J Hay, K Scott, S Henderson, D Turnbull, J Graham, B
Renwick, D McGuinness.
Referee -- I Ramage (Berwick).

West of Scotland 13, Melrose 26
THE enthusiasm of those who follow West of Scotland is infectious. By
the middle of Saturday evening they could have convinced anyone that
they will remain in Division One next year.
Perhaps the reality will be somewhat different, but what if for sure
is that if this game against Melrose was the final straw then they went
down fighting.
To score two tries in the final quarter and make what may have
appeared a pasting into something rather different showed a depth of
spirit which will stand West in good stead in whichever division they
find themselves.
They can boast an excellent half back pairing in Fraser Stott and
David Barrett, and the back row trio of David McVey, David McLeish, and
John Shaw caught the eye in both attack and defence.
Melrose, on the other hand, continue their up and down season looking
at times like the mean machine of old and at others rather fragile.
Jim Telfer was typically frank in his summary of events as the gloom
gathered over a damp Burnbrae: ''That was not very good.
''They should have had a lot more and faded quite a bit towards the
end.''
It had seemed in the early stages like just a matter of time before
West defences were breached but they held firm until three minutes
before half time.
Gary Parker had slotted two penalties in reply to Barrett's single
penalty when Ian Leighton intruded between the centres for a well-taken
try which Parker converted.
Once the scoreboard boys had got their act together, we realised it
was 3-13 and all to play for.
Although Melrose had all the options in the line out, with the height
and bulk of Robbie Brown, Ewan Simpson, and Doddie Weir, their
possession was rather scrappy.
Within five minutes of the restart, though, they had stretched the
lead when Gary Parker crossed for a try born of Craig Chalmers' break
and Ross Brown's link.
The irrepresible Parker converted then added two further penalties for
a 21 point haul with which he declared himself well pleased.
West were not finished, though, and the eager Stuart Munro, who had
replaced Mark Craig just minutes earlier, finished off a fine spell of
West pressure with a try.
McVey and Shaw were in the van of a continuing fightback just two
minutes from time -- as referee Leslie struggled with a damp pea in his
whistle -- and it led to a try for Chris Hart after Munro had charged to
the line.
Full marks to West for effort, although some punch is needed in the
midfield if real success is to follow, but Melrose are some way off
their best and Doddie Weir looks well out of place at blindside flanker.
West of Scotland -- A Williamson; M J Craig, D R McKee, C Hart, A
Hogarth; D N Barrett, F H Stott; P Wong, S Blair, A Crear, S Campbell, G
C Perrett, D A McVey, D McLeish, J Shaw. Replacement: S Munro for Craig
(57min).
Melrose -- I Leighton; C A Joiner, R N C Brown, A G Shiel, G A Parker;
C M Chalmers, B W Redpath; M G Browne, S Scott, D Lunn, R R Brown, E M

Gala 14, Jed-Forest 13
HISTORY books speak of Jethart Justice when Borders Rievers were
hanged first and tried later. But there was no justice for Jed-Forest in
a gripping game at Netherdale, where Gala repelled the raiders with two
late penalty goals from Gregor Townsend.
Gala coach Peter Dods openly admitted his side did not really deserve
the points, but that was little consolation to Jed, whose commitment and
spirit was total.
''We got out of jail,'' said Dods. The Jed forwards dominated, with
the back row of Kevin Armstrong, Ronnie Kirkpatrick, and Calum Brown
outstanding, and they also cleaned up the line-out.
It was not a day for running rugby on a heavy pitch, and yet it was an
inspirational break from Townsend which set up Chris Dalglish for the
Gala try on the stroke of half-time. The stand-off had to take over the
kicking duties when Michael Dods, who had put Gala ahead with a penalty,
hirpled off with a knee injury. Dods went to see the SRU doctor
yesterday at Murrayfield and could be out of action for several weeks.
However, Jed's response was to steal Gala line-out ball on the home
line and good control and the pick-up by Armstrong produced the try. A
penalty by Chris Richards early in the second half and a try from
Kirkpatrick put Jed in the driving seat until Townsend, under pressure,
showed a calm head and boot.
Defeat has almost certainly dumped Jed into division two next season,
but Gala are not safe either. ''We still have a lot of work to do,''
said Dods.
Gala -- M Dods; M Moncrieff, G Bayley, B Swan, C Dalglish; G Townsend,
G Farquharson; G Isaac, I Corcoran, H Hunter, R Hogg, G Paxton, M
Ballantyne, T Weir, J Amos. Replacement: D Changleng for Dods (35min).
Jed-Forest -- C Richards; K Amos, A Douglas, H Hogg, M Yule; G Scott,
G Renwick; N McIlroy, K Barrie, R Johnstone, R Murrow, C Hynd, K
Armstrong, R Kirkpatrick, C Brown.
Referee -- J Bacigalupo (Edinburgh Wanderers).

Stewart's-Melville FP 13, Stirling County 27
THE sheer grinding, burrowing power of the battle hardened Stirling
County forwards in rolling or driving their mauls proved the most
influential factor in a full hearted contest, brilliantly refereed by
Jim Fleming, and in which the swamped conditions at Inverleith mitigated
against the open style that is the Stewart's-Melville FP hallmark.
Stirling are indeed fortunate that they can afford to leave on the
bench a loose forward of the high quality of Gordon Mackay, but even he
must have felt some frustration at the sight of Gareth Flockhart giving
an outstanding performance, whether going forward or on retreat, capped
by the clinching try.
The College scrummage held its own, Ben Gordon did especially well at
the shorter line-out throws and Willie Faulds of the big leap had a rare
duel with Malcolm Norval.
Finlay Calder still has classy little touches in his locker and Alan
Kittle made several rollicking sorties, but the College pack seldom
matched their rivals in the close quarter exchanges where Kevin McKenzie
so often was the reactivator, Stewart Hamilton, streetwise and crafty,
Jim Brough excelling in scrummage ball control and Brian Ireland
providing yet another example of his total commitment to unglamorous
chores.
Mark McKenzie's assessment of what was on and what wasn't proved
fairly accurate and, despite the atrocious underfoot conditions, he gave
an admirable display of goal kicking with five penalty goals which took
Stirling to 15-6 after 51 minutes, then the conversion of the opening
try by Colin McRobert.
It was symptomatic of the difficulties the College backs experienced
in moving by hand a ball eventually like an orange pip that a breakdown
at Danny Bull enabled Mark McKenzie to hack the loose ball and McRobert
to do the same and then use his electrifying pace to stay ahead of the
pursuit for the try.
The tidy skills of Matt McGrandles complemented the power work of Ian
Jardine, Ken Harper mixed his game cleverly and Angus Turner is an
accomplished wing.
The Colleges backs might have prospered more had their forward
colleagues excelled in ball retention instead of occasionally having
ball stolen by worldly wise opponents of impressive upper body strength.
Mark McKenzie's conversion of McRobert's try gave Stirling a virtually
unassailable 22-6 margin and they closed the door with a crashover
scored by Gareth Flockhart, twisting and turning past three tackles
after standing off yet another ruck in a spell of Stirling siege in
which Kevin McKenzie had taken a lead role.
It spoke volumes for College tenacity and resilience, however, and
hinted at what might have been in more favourable conditions that they
signed off with a magnificent bout of handling launched by mazy breakout
from Nick Penny, linkage by Gordon, Ross McNulty and Kittle and swift
exploitation of a tap offside penalty by Niall Gallagher for a closing
try by Graeme Burns and a conversion by Murray Thomson. Teams:
Stewart's-Melville FP -- M M Thomson; N J Penny, P N Gallagher, P W B
Flockhart, D J Bull; F I Pollock, G G Burns; R B McNulty, A J Cadzow, A
J Kittle, B Gordon, W T Faulds, M T Paton, F Calder, D Caughey.
Stirling County -- C M Sangster; A S M Turner, M McGrandles, I C
Jardine, C McRobert; M McKenzie, K G M Harper; J T Gibson, K D McKenzie,
G B Robertson, J S Hamilton, M Norval, G N Flockhart, J Brough, B
Ireland.
Referee -- J M Fleming (Boroughmuir).

Scotland 22, Ireland 3
SCOTLAND, finishing strongly with three tries in the last 25 minutes,
beat Ireland comfortably by 22-3 in the women's rugby international
yesterday at Myreside. It was the third time in as many matches that the
Scots have beaten the Irish.
Ireland had the wind advantage in the first half, but they made little
of it. The interval score was three-all with a penalty goal each by
Elaine Black for Scotland and Raeltine Shrieves.
An intrusion by Debbie Francis from the blind-side wing created the
opening for Sandra Williamson to score in 57 minutes. It was the
Edinburgh scrum half's third try against Ireland.
Scotland profited from their stronger pack when they disrupted an
Irish heel on the visitors' line for flanker Anny Freitas to pounce to
score nine minutes later, and full back Micky Cave rounded off by
running in from fully 40 metres, Black converting.
* GLASGOW have recalled two Stirling County players, Russell Kennedy
and Robert Wyllie, for the team for the under-19 district championship
match against North and Midlands at Cupar on Wednesday (7pm).
Kennedy returns at centre, with Kilmarnock's Stuart Jenkins switching
to the left wing to the exclusion of Ayr's Chris McDonald. Wyllie, who,
like Kennedy, played in the November under-19 district series, replaces
Graeme Inglis, the Hutchesons'/Aloysians wing forward who was sent off
in Glasgow's 12-0 win over the South last week. Team:
R Williams (Stewartry); G D Caldwell (Ayr), R D Kennedy (Stirling), N
Barrett (GHK), S Jenkins (Kilmarnock); A Sievwright (Stirling), R White
(Stewartry); M Smith (Glasgow Academicals), C P Docherty (GHK), R Harvey
(Cartha Queen's Park), D Hough (Ardrossan), G T Macfarlane (West), R
Wyllie (Stirling), E Macdonald (Newton Stewart), I W Sinclair (GHK),
captain. Replacements -- G Ferguson (Ayr), M Hogarth (Ardrossan), D
Wilson (Cambuslang), C McDonald (Ayr), C Houston (Clarkston), S Anderson
(Garnock), L McIntyre (West), D McComiskey (Ayr).

KELSO ensured that they will play in the new second division next
season with a 22-12 victory over Preston Lodge FP at Poynder Park. The
Border club have to thank their best known player, John Jeffrey, for the
only try of the match, with Graeme Aitchison scoring the rest of their
points from a conversion and five penalties.
Biggar, who defeated Haddington 8-0 to move into third place in
Division Two, will have to wait until a final decision is made by the
championship committee as to the validity of the score. The original
referee, John Denham, had to be substituted in the first half after
twisting his knee and was replaced by first class referee Ernie Murray,
who is a Haddington member. Biggar agreed to play the game as a league
match subject to the decision of the championship committee. If the win
stands, Biggar will play at least in the Third Division next season,
still with a chance of pipping Selkirk for the final place in Division
Two.
A place in Division Four of the Premier Division next season is
guaranteed to Ayr after they won their tenth league match in a row 33-13
against Edinburgh University. Their county neighbours, Kilmarnock, are
virtually certain to join them but the other two places in Division Four
are very much in doubt. The next four teams in the league, Clarkston,
Hillhead/Jordanhill, Langholm and Portobello FP, all lost, and these
clubs plus Dunfermline and Trinity Academicals are certain to play in
the First Division of the National League, with two of the clubs winning
the last two places in the Premier Division.
The top two teams in Division Four will also play in the National
First Division but it appears that the final placings will not be known
until the final game of the season, as the top four teams, Glenrothes,
Duns, Livingston and Aberdeen GSFP all won on Saturday.
Berwick, leading Division Five, are certain to play in National League
Division Three next season when they scored their ninth victory in 10
matches, 33-13 against Paisley.
Annan lost their place at the head of Division Six when they were
beaten 19-13 at St Andrews University, their first league defeat in two
seasons. Waysiders/Drumpellier take over the leadership after a 22-12
win over Marr.
Garnock completed their ninth win in as many matches with a 66-5
victory over Panmure in Dundee.
The Ayrshire club will definitely play in National Division Six next
season and look to be on course to winning the Division Seven title next
month. At the bottom of the division, Waid Academy FP, who won their
second league match of the season, and Panmure will play in Division
Seven next season.

GENERAL Cable, Britain's sixth biggest cable operator with 11% of the
market and access to 1.6m homes, is back on the starting grid for
flotation this spring on the London Stock Exchange and on America's
Nasdaq.
The flotation was to have taken place last summer but was postponed
because of poor market conditions and a proponderance of new issues at
the time.
Conditions now are considered to be a lot more favourable for the
issue which should raise more than #200m and value the company at
between #600m asnd #700m.
Philippe Galteau, managing director, commented, ''Current market
conditions and an increased level of awareness and understanding of the
UK cable communciations industry leads us to believe the time is now
appropriate to reinstate our flotation plans and to allow UK investors
the chance to participate further in this exciting industry.''
Aside from providing both telephone and television cable services to
the residential market, General Cable is a major provider of business
telecommunications services within the UK cable communications industry.
It has interests in three of the major UK cable markets, Western London
(The Cable Corporation), Yorkshire (Yorkshire Cable Group) and
Birmingham (Birmingham Cable Corporation).
The company is an indirect subsidiary of Compagnie Ge*ne*rale des Eaux
(CGE), one of the largest public companies in France.
Proceeds of the flotation, which is sponsored by the Lazard Houses
with NatWest Securities as boker to the issue, will be used to fund
General Cable's share of the Systems funding requirements to develop
their networks and to repay borrowings.

WE have an award for the most imaginative reason for a postponed
match. It goes to Partick Thistle, ever an inventive side.
The Diary dutifully turned up at Firhill on Saturday, on your behalf,
to sample the executive lunch and watch Thistle play Motherwell. A
mournful Tommy Dickson, the Jags' commercial manager, was busy putting
the champagne back on ice, the pea and ham soup on the back burner, and
the pies into the fridge.
''The groundsman thinks it's something to do with the greenhouse
effect,'' said Tommy, referring to the sea of mud that is presently
masquerading as the Firhill pitch. This is as clever as anything British
Rail ever comes up with, we thought, and could be the start of a whole
new genre of excuses for the benefit of disappointed fans.
Such as: leaves on the pitch, wrong kind of snow in the penalty area,
a signalling failure involving the stand-side linesman, Chic Charnley
running out of steam.
Between the global warming and their undersoil heating, Thistle should
have the hottest quagmire of any pitch. Mud bath, anyone?
The postponement denied the Diary the opportunity for this vigorous
sporting work-out: 12noon champagne reception; 12.15 address by Robert
Reid, Thistle historian; 12.30 more champagne; 12.45 John Lambie's
observations on the the forthcoming clash; 1.15 four-course lunch with
wines, liqueurs and cigars; 2.30 pre-match entertainment with stand-up
comic; 3pm the match, with pies and hot drinks at half-time; 4.40-5.30
back to the bar.
The Diary was particularly disappointed to miss the tour of the
Thistle trophy room (12.17 to 12.18). And John Lambie's analysis. Mr
Lambie recently informed a radio audience concerning a Thistle
performance: ''We were cock-a-hop (sic) but then it was a case of one
flew over the cuckoo's nest.'' Mr Lambie is a keen pigeon-fancier.
Lure of the lycra
IT was a short hop, step and jump from Firhill to the Kelvin Sports
Arena for the Great Britain v. France indoor athletics. For some, it was
the lure of the lycra. ''My husband's here to see Zodiac and I'll
definitely be having a peek at Linford Christie,'' a West End lady
informed us.
Zodiac is the glamorous TV gladiator who, in a parallel life, is Kate
Staples, the British pole vaulter. The Diary was afraid that, at any
moment, fellow gladiators Jet and Panther might descend on bungee ropes
from the Kelvin Hall roof to spoil Zodiac's run-up.
Kate Staples proved herself not only a lycra lovely but a proficient
athlete, winning her competition easily.
The whole event had a kindergarten quality with hordes of weans
clattering around trying to get Zodiac's autograph. There were also free
samples of Lucozade sports drink. One lady had two tins stuffed into the
ample waistband of her skirt. Well, why not? Linford Christie apparently
keeps his cans of Lucozade down the front of his shorts.
Off-balance
IN the business pages of the Daily Telegraph the day before the last
lot of Five Nations matches, we find an interview with international
rugby referee Tony Trigg. He is in the financial pages because his day
job is finance director of Allied Domecq, the bevvy multinational.
But he is talking about rugby and his experiences having refereed 16
internationals. ''It makes you very broad-minded and balanced,'' he
says. He adds: ''Sadly I will be at Murrayfield on Saturday when anybody
at all interested in rugby football will be at Twickenham.'' See these
balanced, broad-minded English, don't you just love them?
Sting in the tail
WHAT'S this we hear of fists flying during a pre-Murrayfield friendly
match between a Cartha Queen's Park verterans' XV and some of their
soul-mates from the Emerald Isle?
Afraid so, with one of the Cartha chaps being sent off for a bit of
boxing. Who could be so churlish as to welcome our Irish cousins in this
way?
An Irishman, in fact. Niall Loakman, a well-known Glasgow banker,
found himself making the early trip to the showers. But don't be too
harsh on our man. He has already been punished. As a result of a small
wound received in the encounter he had to have a tetanus jag.

'To The Woman Alone, going to the bookies is like gatecrashing a
Masonic meeting'
OVER the years there have been many changes in the socially accepted
Things To Do. Naturally, a woman must still wear a knee-length skirt to
Henley; hats, of course, are still de rigeur at Ascot. But children are
allowed into pubs and football fans are even buying shares. However,
there remains a tight knit community where women are still viewed with
utmost suspicion.
Enter The Woman Who Goes To The Bookies Alone or as the punters view
her, The Woman With Two Heads.
I like football and racing and am not averse to a wager on the outcome
of the 3.15 at Wincanton or the result of a third division tie between
Caley Thistle and Ross County, but the problem starts with crossing the
threshold of the bookies.
All credit to the major chains. They have made every effort to make
their offices more user-friendly, but it's hard to get away from the
smoke-filled, down-at-heel atmosphere, especially as the changes have
mainly entailed soft drinks machines, nasty plastic seating, and patches
of carpet. Recently I visited a betting shop in Glasgow city centre, but
at the mention of a ladies' toilet there were only blank stares. That's
hardly the way to encourage a mixed clientele.
The first hurdle for The Woman Alone is actually going into the shop.
First, the furtive glance up and down the street to see if anyone
recognises you; second, the dash through the door before anyone does;
third, the embarrassing silence.
Once inside, for the uninitiated it's like the command centre at Nasa.
The screens blink and flicker, and mysterious phrases blare over the
tannoy. On the way to the post, under orders, and the magic words
''they're off''. Pictures flash in from all over the world: one minute
South Africa, then the quaint cosiness of National Hunt racing from
Kelso, the 'crack' from Fairyhouse and finally the delights of greyhound
racing at Catford. A daunting experience, and that's before placing a
bet.
To a stranger it would be a minefield; to The Woman Alone it's like
gatecrashing a Masonic meeting. And the phrases are just as alien. What
kind of bet to put on? A placepot, a jackpot, a Yankee, a Canadian, or
the strangely named Heinz. Where did these names come from and why isn't
there a Burmese, a Gambian, or even a Venezuelan?
Having steered a course through these complexities the moment of truth
arrives. You've glanced through the form, made your selection, handed in
the slip and now all eyes are on the screen. Just as well, because The
Woman Alone still has to contend with the suspicious stares of regulars
bemused by her presence.
Racing is often described as the sport of kings, and the Queen's
interest has long been documented, but the men who frequent the bookies
are a long way from the royal enclosure at Ascot. The betting shop is a
sociologist's dream . . . or nightmare.
The Man Who Knows It All has swaggered across and derides the choices
of the other punters. His Saturday has begun by watching Channel 4's
Morning Line. He is sure of success. This will be the day when it will
all come right for him. He begins to shout strange phrases at the
screen. ''Ease up'' he boasts as his horse romps home or ''How far'' as
it gallops 10 lengths ahead of its rivals coming round the home bend.
That's on a good day. On a bad one there will be a questions over the
jockey's pre-race activities.
There are several other stereotypes in betting shops from Inverness to
Stranraer. There's always The Drunk. (Often more than one). There's also
the Old Man With Nowhere Else To Go; and The Medallion Man. The most
fascinating members of the cast is The Man Who Has Bet His Shirt. He's
the hardest to spot. For nonchalance is the key here.
After his selection goes on its nose going over the last while 20
lengths clear, the only indication that he might be suffering is a
slight tightening of his frame and possibly a blink of his eye. This man
has ice in his veins. For him it's not always the winning that matters,
but merely the taking part. Meanwhile, The Man Who Knows It All is
throwing his #1 slip on the floor in disgust.
But for all the suspicion and dread of being The Woman Alone there is
something entrancing about the atmosphere and the sense of excitement
when your selection wins at 8-1, especially when you're the only one
collecting that magic word . . . winnings.
One final mystery: We often hear of the luck of the Irish. Surely they
must believe that themselves because I've never been in a betting shop
where there wasn't an Irish accent. And not all of them were priests.

ANDY Goram: Villain or victim? Depending on which newspapers you take
and your indentikit picture of a sporting hero you will make a choice,
but if Goram is anything he is an enigma.
He gives the impression he has decided to prove all on his own the
sporting adage that goalkeepers are cerebrally challenged, yet his
behaviour between the sticks suggests something entirely different. In
fact, he survives in his sport by virtue of a mentality more robust than
the persona may suggest.
How else could the Rangers keeper get out of bed in the morning? A
variety of problems are pressing down on Goram, but somehow he picks
himself up. With emotions bruised it isn't easy to switch on a smile,
but he forces himself to project a carefree image.
''How you look can be half the battle,'' he said. ''It's important to
appear confident and brash, perhaps because there is such a fine line
between success and failure for a keeper.''
Natural or not, there is an easy manner about Goram and in common with
the famous he has a certain magnetism, but unfortunately for him he
attracts problems and can find himself in compromising situations which,
of course, appeal greatly to the tabloid press. Despite the Jack the Lad
front, life can be difficult, although Goram refuses to retreat from the
world.
Whereas others woud be afraid to open the curtains again, Goram can
walk out in front of 45,000 and perform like a real-life Alf Tupper.
''Perhaps it's a strength I have. I don't know, but I do know I love to
play football,'' he says, ''and sometimes when I walk out in front of
all those supporters it is like escaping.''
Like himself his statement is a contradiction. Goram, now 32, can
build barriers inside his head, shutting off all matters which have no
bearing on his game, and while football has long been a passion it now
offers refuge from his foibles and those who live off them.
He insists he is sometimes followed by strangers, and far from
succumbing to paranoia he believes his shadows have been dispatched by
the small-page papers hungry for further peccadilloes and exposes like
the one which ran in a blatt a couple of weeks ago.
''You know, if everything written or said about me were true I'd be
bankrupt,'' he said. ''I'd have no home. I'd have nothing.
''All right, I've done things I shouldn't have and in future I'll be
more careful, but it is ridiculous when you have to look over your
shoulder whenever you go out and be forced to make detours because
someone is following you.
''I enjoy a pint with my friends in Penicuik, but why shouldn't I? And
yes, I also like the horses, but why should that make me any different
from most others?''
Probably because he is the goalkeeper for Rangers and Scotland, and
whether he likes it or not his job sets him apart in that it gives him
recognition, fame, and a certain status. In the Scottish village that
makes him a target, and in his more reflective moments he admits he
sometimes makes himself easy prey.
''Footballers are noticed and sometimes we do give them (the tabloids)
ammunition,'' he admitted.
Goram was not the first footballer to feature in a kiss-and-tell
story, but fortunately his marriage to Tracy remains intact. He is
learning from mistakes, which will come as a relief to those closest to
him and also Rangers' manager Walter Smith, who must be afraid to lift
the papers in the morning.
His players are big news off the field also, but Goram at least has
resolved to remain on the back pages, although he is not about to
undergo radical character change. ''I can't. If I were to change I
wouldn't be Andy Goram and who knows, that could have an effect on the
way I play,'' he said.
''I have had a long talk with Walter Smith and I know Rangers can't
tolerate being involved in certain stories, but I can't stop being me. I
am what I am.
''I know everybody has me marked down now as some kind of idiot, but
there's not much I can do about that, and I don't believe I should have
to explain myself to anyone other than my wife and the gaffer.
''Tracy is interested in football and I can go home and talk to her
which means I don't bottle everything up. That helps because I'm deeper
than people think, but only my family see the emotion.
''So far as the gaffer is concerned I don't think he wants me to
change, although I have to be more careful in the future. But I'm no
monk.''
No doubt the religious community are much relieved. They have problems
of their own and are answerable to a much higher authority than even
Walter Smith, who does his best to try to fathom Goram, to understand
what makes his keeper tick. It can't be easy.
First mention of the keeper's name can induce a roll of the eyes and a
shake of the head, but after exasperation comes appreciation for Goram's
ability. ''He is the best keeper I have ever worked with,'' says Smith,
who admits Goram's exploits are of concern to a club which must be
conscious of the corporate image.
''So far though, this stuff about his outside life doesn't seem to
hurt what he does for us,'' Smith added, ''and if he takes care of
himself he could go on doing it for a while yet.''
But how much longer does Goram have? He must adhere to a specially
designed training regime to protect a his left knee which was rebuilt
two years ago and most of his fitness work is done in the gymnasium. A
balance has to be maintained between fitness and protection, yet the
32-year-old has a tendency to put on weight, something else about which
he must always be mindful.
If he remains in control, Goram, who is still recovering from a
hamstring which he damaged five weeks ago, reckons he can play at the
sharp end for another five season and earlier this season Rangers
extended his contract until 1998. But that was after Smith, critical of
the keeper's attitude toward work, had put him on the transfer list.
In response, Goram buckled down and he is at Ibrox until four in the
afternoon working in the gym. ''I want to get out in front of the
supporters, the people who are usually the first to let a player know
when he isn't doing it for them,'' he said.
Goram has become one of the crowd's favourites and he thrives on their
respect and appreciation. He is inspired by the sound, the passion, and
the tension of match days and in difficult times it is the thought of
sampling the atmosphere again which helps him through, but what will
inspire him when the chants subside and the ball stops rolling?
Often players heavily dependent on the weekly fix fail to cope when it
is withdrawn and life can become unbearable. The former player becomes
difficult and depression is never far away, but Goram knows what he will
be doing.
''When it's over, I'll play cricket,'' he said. ''You know, I've
always preferred playing cricket to football probably because of the
one-on-one thing. Bowler against batsman and vice versa. Cricket will
become Andy Goram's refuge.''
Goram signed for West Bromwich Abion the same year he signed for
Lancashire, but after a short spell at the Hawthorns he moved to Oldham
and made his debut in goal when he was 17. It was around that time his
father, Lewis, who died two years ago, was advising him to concentrate
on football because the financial rewards would be greater.
As a 20-year-old with a gift he came into contact with goalkeeping
coach Alan Hodgkinson, who still works with him two days a week at
Ibrox, and the pair developed a relationship based on mutual respect and
trust. In fact, Goram says Hodgkinson, who works with various keepers
and also the Scottish international side, became principal confidant in
succession to his father and he turns frequently to the Englishman.
However, when the game starts Goram is on his own. It's the way he
likes it and if he can keep only a few important people in his life
happy that will do.

Sir,--For the first time in many years, I sat at home to watch
Scotland's latest rugby exploits. Whilst enjoying the comfort of my own
home, and the freedom to partake of the national distillation at will, I
missed greatly being at Murrayfield. It is becoming increasingly
difficult, if not well nigh impossible, for an ordinary supporter to
attend a major international. Tickets are available to rugby club
members, as they should be; to those wealthy enough to have a debenture
or two; or to those who have joined the hospitality tents. It would
appear that rugby, or in particular Murrayfield, has no desire to
welcome the unattached to their portals. This is a great shame as I am
sure many who attend under the auspices of hospitality do so for the
champagne and smoked salmon, and not for the rugby.
The last time I managed to gain entry to Murrayfield, I was struck by
the austerity of the arena. Gone was the warmth and vitality that was
such an important ingredient in Scotland's triumphant 1990 season. Then
the crowd almost seemed to participate in the game, now they seem to be
mere onlookers peering down from a great height upon a distant scene.
The passion of the Scottish crowd has been neutered, which must be a
great pity to those striving in the Nation's colours.
The drive of the SRU in constructing such a magnificent arena must be
applauded. My concern is that it may engender even more elitism amongst
the support than was already in existence, and is curtailing the growing
appeal of the game as a spectator sport.

Sir,--Whether or not Willie Miller's dismissal will benefit Aberdeen
in the long run is a matter of opinion.
What I found objectionable was Miller's reaction, complaining that he
had been let down, stabbed in the back, or words to that effect. That
may be true, but I don't remember him complaining about the dismissal of
Alex Smith, as a result of a campaign by some supporters to get Miller
the job in the first place. Alex Smith took his sacking quietly and with
dignity, although he had much more cause for complaint (winner of both
League and Scottish cups, regularly championship runners-up).
Mind you, Willie Miller never could accept a decision given against
him.

Sir,--As an Albion Rovers season ticket-holder for many, many years I
am thoroughly disgusted and angry at the attitude of ARFC board of
directors (Marwick, McGoogan, Forrester, Lyttle) over the sacking of
team manager Tom Spence.
Tom Spence was making something of that team. Even the supporters knew
this. That's why there was no barracking directed at Tom Spence from the
supporters, and with no money coming from the board either to buy
players or sign on players, I think Tom was performing a miracle every
week just fielding a side. Players like Billy Dolan, Jim Kerr, and
others played for the Rovers not for the money (God help them) but for T
Spence.
Had Tom Spence been given the money that was wasted on the terracing
(which still can't be used) he could have taken us into the first
division by now.
It's embarrassing for true supporters to see the chairman and
directors toast the team losing a game and on TV, too. I think it's time
the SFA stepped in to stop the boards of football clubs drinking alcohol
before, during (at half-time) and after games. It's called hospitality
by the way.
Hospitality should mean putting a good team on the park for the
supporters and encouraging your manager and team to do well.
By the way, Mr Marwick, why the rush to sell the ground?
I think you and your board are trying to do a Third Lanark to this
club!
Shame on you all.

Sir,--Perhaps when the governing bodies of Scottish Sport start to
reap the benefits of the National Lottery they will consider allocating
a substantial share to the ''outposts'' of Scotland, to compensate for
the disadvantages they suffer.
As an adopted Aberdonian who left sunny Govan some 20 years ago for
the Silver City, I am acutely aware of the problems facing sports
enthusiasts who live in the north.
Progress is being made, but in so many disciplines the cream are
achieving success in spite of the facilities, not because of them. Where
in the north or north-east can budding hurdlers or hockey stars hone
their skills on a cold winter night?
For competition they have to overcome the attitude that the major
fixtures must be held in central Scotland, not only because they have
the best facilities, but because the north and north-east are too far
for competitors to travel.
The journey north is the same length as the journey south which so
many dedicated sportsmen and woman make routinely before every major
competition. Let us hope that the governing bodies, based in central
Scotland, will take this opportunity to redress the balance.

Sir, -- Back in 1973, Celtic took their eighth title in succession. In
the last seven games they scored 23 goals for the loss of only one. It
was a beautifully honed professional game, full of attacking verve.
Twenty-two years on, we watch Rangers grind towards a seventh
consecutive league flag. The #70m plus has bought a consistent ability
to hammer Scottish oponents into submission, but little else. None of
the seven titles could ever be called memorable; Laudrup and
Mikhailichenko the only interesting players. The club's real enterprise
is shown in financial management, standing as a perfect example of
Thatcherism, housed in a stadium which is a monument to Calvinism.
Where is the entertainment in that?

SOMEONE should take Fergus McCann aside and explain to him the facts
of football life, before he carries Celtic into a damaging conflict with
the Scottish Football Association.
No-one is doubting the Canadian millionaire's ability to read a
balance sheet, and after the so-successful share issue his business
acumen cannot be seriously questioned, particularly by the people who
took the grand old club to the brink of bankruptcy.
But in football affairs the Celtic saviour has a great deal to learn.
So far there have been few signs that he is willing to live by the
rules and regulations of either the SFA or the Scottish Football League.
Instead of the #100,000 fine imposed by the League providing a
salutary lesson for McCann, he has now gone on to challenge the
authority of the SFA in the Tommy Burns poaching saga.
Once more he has placed the club on a collision course with the game's
ruling body, and once again he will lose.
But, more important than McCann, Celtic will be losers, too. That is
perhaps the saddest thing of all. A club, no, more than a club, an
institution, is now losing friends.
One leading legislator told me recently: ''It used to be a pleasure to
visit the Celtic boardroom. Nowadays no-one in the game feels
particularly comfortable when they go there . . . ''
Now, in the grand scheme of things, that may not be too important; but
in football people have to learn to live together in what is a small
community. Quite clearly the man in command at Parkhead is finding that
difficult.
Eventually that will be a major problem for the club. Over the years
Celtic have enjoyed a good relationship with both footballing bodies --
better than that enjoyed by their Old Firm rivals.
That is something which McCann should be guarding jealously, instead
of frittering it away in futile arguments with authority which he is
never going to win.
Basically, Celtic cannot be run like any of the other business
ventures that made McCann his millions. That is because Celtic -- and
any football club you care to mention -- is more than merely a business.
Figures on a balance sheet cannot convey the depth of feeling clubs
can instil in their supporters. Nor can dividends for shareholders be
expected on any kind of regular basis.
Football just isn't like that. It is far, far different, as many other
millionaires found out before the Celtic chief executive came on the
scene.
In the not-so-distant past, clubs were run by businessmen who used
football to boost their images in the local communities. Now a different
breed of entrepreneur has come in but, essentially, the game has not
altered.
The rules haven't changed either. Whatever the current belief at
Parkhead, these rules are the same for every club.
When Sir Robert Kelly and, later, Desmond White, and still later, Jack
McGinn, were chairmen of the club, that was recognised. They would argue
the club's cause, defend the club's position, but they would never break
the rules in the flagrant manner of the Burns case and then expect to
get away with it.
Fergus McCann should take their example on board. There is no way that
anyone -- no matter how wealthy he may be -- ever will be allowed to run
roughshod over the soccer establishment.
Rangers chairman David Murray learned that lesson when he was left
with a bloody nose after ill-advised attempts to start a Super League.
McCann, despite warnings, has still to realise he is out of his depth
when it comes to tackling the often-complex legislation of our national
game.
It is now time for him to realise that he is on a loser over the Burns
affair. His fellow clubs -- with one exception -- have already told him
that. Now he should accept the overwhelming verdict.
When he is persuaded to do so then, perhaps, instead of all these
various diversions, the chief executive can address the REAL issues at
Parkhead, the issues that most concern his newly enfranchised support.
Because although the rescue package has been successful, there remains
a deep well of discontent among fans about what is happening on the
field.
That is where attention must be focused. Rows with the SFA, rows with
former employees, rows with other clubs, and even rows with discredited
former board members, cannot disguise the fact that only part of the
salvage operation has been accomplished.
The one that matters most, the premier division balance sheet if you
like, makes bleak reading. Celtic have won only around a quarter of
their games and scored just a goal a game in doing so.
That suggests to me that ALL energies at the club should be
concentrated on just the one thing -- and I don't mean the seemingly
endless and futile arguments which simply disguise the Parkhead
problems.
Celtic MUST qualify for Europe. If they don't, then the rescue
scenario will have a tarnished look and the new shareholders will demand
answers.
When the recent history of the club is written, Fergus McCann will
hold an honoured place as the man who stopped Celtic going into
receivership. But, if he wants more than that, then money has to be
released to bring in new players, and that has to happen sooner rather
than later.
For if the transfer moves are delayed much longer, Europe could become
a distant memory and no amount of diversions would save Fergus McCann
from the criticism that would follow.

GAELIC football is from Ireland, of course. It stands a bit between
soccer and rugby, but if the Rugby School hadn't corrupted the game
through that Ellis chap, Association and Rugby might not have diverged.
For the very origins of football lie in a very rough game, played by
very rough rubes.
For Gaelic football was played in Britain, and Scotland for many years
continued to hold the game in many a town. Ireland, of course, had
bigger problems than Scotland, and the games of hurling -- shinty in
Scotland -- and the native Gaelic football games and many other sports,
Irish and Highland dancing, and many another Celtic activity,
damned-near died out.
It was not until very late in the nineteenth century that the Gaelic
Athletic Association (GAA) came into being in order to preserve and, in
a way, re-invent the marvellous traditions of Gaelic culture. To that
end has become the remarkable development of Irish dancing, mainly for
the girls in truth, and in very recent years indeed, Gaelic football.
Thus the Willie Dowds Cup, held this weekend at St Aloysius' Rugby Park
in Millerston, near Glasgow.
The weekend saw a huge upsurge of Glasgow Irish consciousness for this
splendid attraction of Donegal versus Dublin. Three years ago the
culchies of Donegal had beaten the jackeens of Dublin in the Irish Sam
McGuire Final, a famous victory, celebrated throughout all the counties
of that country. This year, the third year running, the Glasgow-based
Pearse Park Development Fund people had the top Irish teams competing.
But much more.
There was a ceilidh on Saturday night, of course, with a large
contingent of Irish visitors, many meeting their relations in Glasgow,
relations who have lived here many years. There was a banquet and dinner
last night in a top Glasgow hotel. There is a civic reception for all
concerned at the Glasgow City Chambers this morning. But there was also
the football.
Sunday saw the girls teams competing, Scotland represented by the
Dundee Dalriada team. Most of the girls are actually Irish lassies
studying at Dundee University, average age 20, fine players but with no
experience at all, and they could not hope to beat a very experienced
team from Donegal Downings, who are a great deal younger. The Donegal
team captain was young Susie McGee a 16-year-old schoolgirl, and she is
one of the older girls. But, as the Downings-Donegal manager, Hugh
McClafferty, pointed out in a sporting manner, the Donegal team can draw
upon 21 different Donegal girls' clubs -- Scotland has only one, with
the bulk of the lassies taken from a small Scottish Yooni.
But the young Donegal girls won handsomely with eight goals and eight
points against the rather feeble three points scored by the Caledonian
team. A score of 32-3 was a bit humiliating, or would have been if it
wasn't for the fact that neither Gaels nor girls will slash their wrists
at a footy result. They enjoyed their game and so did myself.
The lassies were followed by the wee boys on a truly dreadful pitch,
(though not as dreadful as it should have been for an old chum, Dougie
Donaldson, the St Aloysius' groundsman who has over 30 years' experience
in his game, hirpled about the last two days, him with a slipped disc,
too, spiking the playing surface. His assistant, Derek Gibson, a mere
boy with 15 years looking after grounds, told me the surface water on
Saturday was so bad they doubted the matches could take place. ''But we
are the best in the business,'' the lads spake in chorus, and indeed
they are: the ground conditions were more than adequate).
The wee boys, captained by 12-year-old Kevin Lafferty, a pupil at
Cambuslang's Trinity High, won for Scotland by a massive advantage of
three goals and two points against only eight points for a Warwickshire
team, representing England. Scotland can win at something, for heaven's
sake. Young Kevin has only been playinga year but I would not pit myself
against him. He's a big wee lad.
But yet another big wee lad is Packy Bonner, the Celtic and Ireland
legend, who once indeed played for Donegal himself. Said Packy: ''You
learn handling from Gaelic, of course, and you learn fitness and how to
handle yourself physically. Gaelic isn't a game for the wee geniuses
like Jimmy Johnstone. You need a bit of weight.'' Dear God, the man is
right. Have you ever seen the height of Packy? Dean Swift, his fellow
countryman, got the idea of Gulliver from Packy.
But this was the big game, the girls and youngsters were but the
starters. The Willie Dowds Cup is no friendly: it is fiercely
competitive. And so it proved to be in this match betwixt the country
and city slickers. Donegal won at the end, but damned close it was. A
John Duffy goal for Donegal won the match really, for they scored only
10 points as against the Dubs' 11 points, with man of the match,
Dublin's John Gildea, scoring four points on his own.
Close to his own achievements has to be the remarkable performances of
the two goalkeepers, even if Dublin's Tom Quinn did fluff a put-in from
Donegal's Duffy. Quinn had an exemplary match after that. But Gary
Walsh, whom we met last year, an accountant from Donegal, had two
wonderful saves in the very last minute, one from Dublin's mercurial
full forward Charlie Redmond (the Maurice Johnson of Gaelic football),
and a rebound to Dessie Farrell saw a save which came from the moon. It
was the last move in the match. Had Dublin scored then they would have
won.
The new Donegal manager P J McGowan, who but recently took over from
Brian McEniff of Bundoran, summed it up twice. ''We won and were lucky
but good enough.'' That was the first summing. The other one was
succinct: ''Will you have a wee one?'' I would. I did. And glad.
' 'You learn handling from Gaelic, of course, and you learn fitness
and how to handle yourself physically.  You need a bit of weight. ' -
PACKY BONNER

FOOTBALL might be rather predictable otherwise, so perhaps it is just
as well that footballers are human. But it makes life difficult for the
managers, as most of the performances in the second division on Saturday
demonstrated.
Clyde manager Alex Smith saw his side lose 3-1 at home to Berwick
Rangers and it was only at 0-3, just after the interval, that Clyde
began to look like a competent team.
''I don't understand it,'' Smith admitted. ''We played so well in
midweek against Dundee United, and also a fortnight ago against them,
and we had a good result in between at Methil. And these are the same
players.''
His only theory was that Clyde's efforts against a premier division
team perhaps took more of a toll on them than the exertions of other
teams against their peers.
Berwick had had two games in two days against Meadowbank which ended
with the disappointment of missing out on a cup-tie against Celtic.
''But it is up to me to lift them,'' manager Tom Hendrie had said before
Saturday's game.
He certainly succeeded. They posed all the threats early on and scored
following free kicks after 25 and 39 minutes. Willie Irvine crossed for
their trialist defender to nod in the opener and a clearance was picked
up by Martin Neil, who drilled in the second from 20 yards.
Warren Hawke headed in an Alan Banks cross for the third and when
substitute Alan McKenzie's header cut the leeway in 56 minutes it served
only to put the home crowd in a more tolerant mood.
Morton, supposedly goal-shy, won 3-0 away to a Stirling Albion team
who had inflicted a first home defeat on leaders Stenhousemuir just a
week before. Derek McInnes set up Derek Lilley's run on goal just before
the break, and scored the second himself from a pass by Marko Rajamaki,
who also set up a tap-in for Alan Mahood.
Meadowbank were only a shadow of the team who had edged past Berwick
and were crushed 4-0 at Dumbarton. Martin Mooney scored the first and
set up the second for Hugh Ward, who turned provider for Charlie Gibson
and Martin McGarvey.

Ayr United 1, Dundee 0
EVERYONE who has listened to the man is well aware that Jim Duffy
talks a good game, has his finger on the pulse of what's happening, is
-- in the footballing sense -- streetwise.
But words uttered by the Dundee manager after his side's 1-0 defeat
against Ayr United at Somerset Park at the weekend were, it would
appear, not for those of a reserved or delicate disposition.
Duffy was with his men for ages in the away dressing room after the
ball had stopped bouncing on Saturday, and although most of the dialogue
was somewhat incoherent from the hallway outside the changing facility,
one could gather by his tone that Duffy was none too pleased.
It is a wonder smoke did not bellow from under the door, such appeared
to be the roasting that was in progress, but when Duffy eventually
appeared he was his usual courteous, calm self -- but his face told
another story.
''You must be disappointed, Jim,'' came a statement. By the man's
expression it was like suggesting to him that Atilla the Hun's main
problem was that the guy just suffered from behavioural problems. ''That
is the understatement of the year,'' said Duffy.
But now comes the difference, because most other managers would have
kicked butt, moaned a little, sworn even, and then forgiven and
forgotten. But not our Jim.
He was obviously brought up in a different way, believing that money
paid out in wages should be worked for, and as his employees had not
done a hand's turn throughout the afternoon, he said that he would fine
them.
A sudden hush went around the place.
He was joking, wasn't he? Hacks looked at each other in disbelief
waiting for the man to smile and say: ''Only kidding, lads,'' but he
didn't.
We have all seen matches where players should have paid the customers
to watch, but to actually dock wages, that really is most unusual.
He will never get away with it, some thought. Will he? Quite frankly,
Duffy could not have cared less what his players' reaction would be, if
they did not do the business -- and they sure did not -- he would fine
them one third of their wages.
And I, for one, am right behind him.
''They can go to the union, do whatever they like,'' he said. ''The
players get appearance money as part of their wages and today they
didn't appear.
''It's a team game, and as a team unit today we were a disgrace.
People pay good money to travel to see us. We can't give the fans their
money back so we will remove it from the players.''
One was of the impression that Duffy could have gone up like a volcano
at any time, such was his displeasure, but he was keeping a tight rein
on his emotions at least to the outside world.
And the manager was not for turning.
''The money will not go into a club fund for any social evenings,'' he
said. ''We will donate it to charity or something like that. It will not
be going to the players.''
Had this performance been dished up in the formative part of the
season, it would not have been tolerated by the Dundee management, but
the damage may have eventually been limited at a later time. But now,
going into the final circuit, that is what appeared so irksome to the
manager.
This defeat means that Dundee, once looking down at the rest of the
first division from afar, have now been caught, and although still in
front, are there by the skin of the teeth, and perhaps now the momentum
has been grasped by others.
As the Dundee players filed past with petted lips, Simon Stainrod was
holding court with the media. The Ayr manager was once the darling of
Dens Park as player/manager, but recently he has become a perfect pest
to the club.
His United side have taken seven of a possible nine points from Dundee
this season and when it is taken on board that Saturday's success was
only Ayr's fourth in the league all season, it is little wonder Stainrod
looked relieved.
However, let us not allow ourselves to be carried off in the euphoria,
because Ayr are no more than a very ordinary team -- a better side would
really have punished Dundee for their ineptness -- but at least this
victory allows the Somerset Park lot to scramble clear of the immediate
drop zone, for the time being.
The winning goal was scored while some were still getting themselves
comfortable. Stainrod -- of course he had to be involved, didn't he --
took a corner, the ball looked over and Vinnie Moore met it with his
forehead, allowing the home fans to work up a lather with excitement.
Stainrod said that the victory should work wonders for his side's
morale, and that after having played well in recent weeks with little to
show for their efforts, United were due a rub of the green.
Dundee now face Raith Rovers, whose warm breath they now feel on the
back of their neck in the table, in a Scottish Cup tie on Saturday, and
if Dundee do not get their act together I, for one, would not fancy
being within 100 miles of their manager that afternoon.

STEFAN Effenberg, sent home in disgrace from the World Cup Finals for
making an obscene gesture to German supporters, has had his return to
the national side blocked by captain Lothar Matthaus.
German coach Berti Vogts had revealed he was considering having the
life ban lifted on Effenberg, who has been highly effective in the
emergence of Borrusia Monchengladbach in the championship of the
Bundesliga this season.
But Matthaus, in a display of player-power that further undermined the
position of Vogts, insisted he would not tolerate a recall for Effenberg
and that Germany had enough quality to continue without his services.
A day later Vogts was forced to admit: ''The time is not right for
Effenberg to play for his country again; the wounds have not healed
after his actions in America.''
By contrast, the career of Tony Meola, who became a national hero
after captaining the USA in the World Cup Finals, continues upwards and
onwards.
The keeper will fulfil his wish to become an actor when he opens in an
off-Broadway production next week. The play, aptly called Tony and
Tina's Wedding, will run for five weeks.
Then he is off to play in Brazil with Botofoga, who are currently
negotiating to sign Bebeto from Deportivo la Coruna.
Since last summer's event, Meola has been playing baseball with the
New York Jets and indoor football with Buffalo Blizzards, whose
attendances almost doubled when he joined the club.
* THE Spanish FA has launched an investigation after claims that
Atletico Madrid rigged games to avoid relegation last season.
The allegations come from former assistant coach Diego Berregan, who
was sacked along with Francisco Maturana because of poor results.
He said that Manuel Diaz Vega, Spain's top referee, had twice been
bribed to obtain favourable results for the Madrid club. One of the
games, he said, was against Osasuna.
The Spanish FA has asked their counterparts in Colombia, where
Berregan is now employed, to provide proof to substantiate the
corruption charges.
However, Atletico Madrid's president, Jesus Gil, has ridiculed the
claims, maintaining they were made to cause trouble in the wake of
Berregan's dismissal.
* FIFA has been called in to settle the future of the Portuguese
internationalist Luis Figo, who apparently has agreed contracts with
both Juventus and Parma.
His duplicity has brought protests among the supporters of Sporting
Lisbon where he has been attacked, his car trashed, and demonstrations
have caused training sessions to be abandoned.
* CONTROVERSY has again clouded Romario's attempt to re-launch his
career atFlamengo.
Apart from several well-publicised fracas in nightclubs, including an
assault on a woman fan who attempted to obtain his autograph, he is
being sued for divorce.
This follows a paternity suit filed against him by a Spanish woman.
Romario, who was also involved in a car crash, said with masterly
understatement:
''This is not a good period in my career, but it is the price of fame.
Supporters want to build you up then knock you down. I am not a god. I
am only a human being.''
His countryman, Augusto Candido, just 23, of Belgian Second Division
side FC Boom, is the third player to die of a heart attack there this
season.
A call has now gone out to improve medical facilities, particularly
rescuscitation equipment, for players at stadia.
Plea by Gullit
A STATESMAN-like call has come from Ruud Gullit to his fellow
professionals in Italy to shun all contact with the Ultras, the
fanatical elements that follow most of the leading clubs and who were
responsible for the tragic death of Genoa fan The former Dutch
international insisted: ''These so-called supporters do not love the
game. They cause more trouble than we can cope with.
''We have also seen riots in London at Chelsea and the death of
another fan in Paris.
''It is now the duty of the players to take a stance and say enough is
enough.
''The players must shun these people and make it clear that we despise
their actions.
''Maybe if we lead a revolution against the Ultras it will end the
traumas and make it a place for decent people to go without fear,''
Gullit said.

IN ENGLAND
0HAD Blackburn won at Old Trafford three weeks ago, they would have
been eight points clear at the top of the Premiership and heavily
fancied to land a first championship since the Great War. Instead, Eric
Cantona scored for Manchester United to cut the lead to two and on
Saturday it was overhauled, however briefly, for the first time in 11
weeks.
But yesterday Alan Shearer grabbed goal No.28 of the campaign with a
second-half header as Blackburn beat 10-man Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 to
leapfrog back to the top.
Near half-time Wednesday's Kevin Pressman was sent off for
deliberately handling Paul Warhurst's shot outside his area. Former
Rangers and England keeper Chris Woods came on in his place.
By then Blackburn were set to go two points clear after a super strike
by Tim Sherwood and a close-range finish from Mark Atkins had sandwiched
Chris Waddle's goal for the visitors.
The evidence of United's comprehensive 3-0 victory over Manchester
City on Saturday was that the Reds will manage without Cantona -- at
least against sides offering no more testing a challenge than their
neighbours have given them this season.
Andy Cole suggested, in making a goal for Paul Ince and scoring the
third himself, that he is settling in nicely; Andrei Kanchelskis, the
other scorer, implied that he will have a greater part to play than in
recent weeks; and all this in the absence of Mark Hughes, tipped to make
an unexpectedly early return following his recent knee injury.
One record United lost on Saturday was for the biggest Premiership
victory of the season, their earlier romp against City being superseded
by Aston Villa's extraordinary 7-1 win over Wimbledon -- who scored
first. Tommy Johnson, recently signed from Derby County, claimed a hat
trick in the reprisals that followed as Peter Shilton, who has joined
the London club as reserve goalkeeper, wondered what he had let himself
in for.
Villa have now lost only twice in 13 league games -- both narrowly and
unluckily -- since Brian Little replaced Ron Atkinson as their manager.
Mark McGhee, who succeeded him at Leicester, has not managed such a
transformation, and on Saturday laid into his team after what some might
have regarded as a good draw, 1-1 away to Arsenal.
McGhee said: ''Not enough of the players seem to care about results or
the club's position, or even each other. Either they produce or we'll
get some other people in.''
That unexpected outburst was rather overshadowed by a report that
George Graham would leave Arsenal this week because of his part in the
transfer which brought John Jensen to Highbury three years ago. The
source of the story was the former Tottenham player Garth Crooks, who
has a show on BBC local radio and was sticking to it yesterday despite
denials by everyone at the club.
On an afternoon of thoroughly contrasting fortunes for Arsenal, Paul
Merson marked an outstanding performance with his first goal since
returning from rehabilitation, but young midfielder Ian Selley broke a
leg in two places.
Arsenal now stand at the top of a group separated by only four points
from the relegation places, which could become even more condensed
following West Ham's home match with Everton tonight.
Swindon's new goal ace Peter Thorne stunned Bolton yesterday with a
double strike for a 2-1 first-leg lead in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final
after Alan Stubbs had put the first division leaders ahead early on.

Aberdeen 2, Rangers 0
ABERDEEN clawed themselves away from second bottom place in the
Premier League with this victory. And Pittodrie players who had failed
Willie Miller so often this season pushed caretaker manager Roy Aitken
toward a permanent role with the club.
If Aitken can continue to coax and cajole this kind of fighting
performance from his team, then the manager's job will surely be his for
keeps.
Rangers remain 14 points clear at the top of the premier division, but
this result suggests that manager Walter Smith's caution over the
championship has some foundation.
Certainly the champions returned to Glasgow last night still angry
over two penalty claims that went against them in the second half.
One came before the Aberdeen spot kick that Billy Dodds converted to
give his team the lead; the other came after it. Neither incident
convinced referee Jim McCluskey, though the second looked as if it
should certainly have been awarded.
By the end, however, Duncan Shearer had scored a second goal and
Aberdeen had taken the three points convincingly.
It was a gritty performance from Aberdeen, one which brought to mind
the manner in which their caretaker manager himself played. The result
now allows Aitken breathing space as he begins to pick up the pieces
after the sacking of Miller.
It was an important result for the new man, and it demonstrated to the
rest of the country that Rangers' relentless march towards the title can
at least be delayed.
Aberdeen fielded a team that looked equipped to attack, while Rangers
appeared to have opted for a more conservative approach. They played new
signings, Alex Cleland and Gary Bollan, in midfield, sitting in the wide
positions.
For long enough in the first half that set-up looked good enough to
allow the Ibrox men to remain at least unbeaten. And, perhaps, do
better.
Eventually, however, the game hinged on the decisions of referee
McCluskey. In 55 minutes, Charlie Miller was brought down by Stephen
Wright as he went through, but the referee waved away Rangers' penalty
claims.
Then, in 58 minutes, a pass-back from Richard Gough had Ally Maxwell
in trouble. When Shearer reached the ball the 'keeper desperately
brought him down, the penalty was given, and Dodds scored.
In 69 minutes, Brian Laudrup was pushed off the ball by John Inglis.
It looked a certain penalty this time, but once more referee McCluskey
waved away Rangers' protests.
Just last week, Rangers' boss Walter Smith was critical of decisions
that went against his team when they met Dundee United. It must have
seemed like history repeating itself yesterday.
The game had started excitingly with Maxwell holding a low shot from
Dodds and then Theo Snelders pushing away a drive from Miller.
In 30 minutes David Robertson saw a gap in the Aberdeen defence, burst
through it, and slammed in a shot only to watch in disbelief as Snelders
punched the ball away.
At this stage Rangers had the better chances but, in the second half,
it was Aberdeen who took the lead and, despite Rangers' pressure, the
Pittodrie men remained in front and added a late second.
After the interval, young Stephen Glass had taken over from Stewart
McKimmie, injured halfway through the first half. The change did not
stop Aberdeen from looking more aggressive.
In 58 minutes they stunned Rangers by going ahead from their penalty.
Four minutes later Gordon Durie replaced Bollan and the Ibrox men pushed
forward looking for the equaliser.
In 68 minutes a corner from Laudrup -- his third in rapid succession
-- found Gough. His header forward almost reached Durie just short of
the goal line, but somehow Snelders got there first with a brave save as
Durie prepared to hook the ball into the net.
Four minutes after that Basil Boli had a chance from close range, but
shot high over.
While Rangers had pressure, Aberdeen were looking dangerous when they
broke forward. There was a warning ten minutes from the end when Shearer
swept over a cross from the left and Dodds smacked a header against the
bar.
The second goal was delayed for just eight minutes. Stuart McCall
tried to be over-elaborate at the edge of his own penalty box. He was
dispossessed by Shearer, who then sent a vicious low shot past Maxwell
to confirm the Aberdeen victory.
Still not content, the burly striker almost scored a third with a long
range shot that Maxwell pushed clear.
At the end, the only demonstrations at Pittodrie came from the fans
celebrating victory.
The threatened protests against chairman Ian Donald did not take place
beforehand -- and there was certainly no room for them afterwards.

Hearts 2, Kilmarnock 2
HEARTS skipper Craig Levein gathered all the experience on the
Tynecastle's staff around him, to salvage a vital point from Kilmarnock
at rain-soaked Tynecastle.
The Scotland defender watched his team go two goals behind inside 18
minutes and then saw defender Dave McPherson and Neil Berry limp out of
the 2-2 draw.
The result was that goalscorers John Millar and Gary Mackay played out
most of the second half filling in at centre half and left back.
And it was the seasoned campaigners like Levein, that summoned up all
their wisdom to avoid what would have been a damaging defeat.
''When you consider that John is very much a forward going midfield
player and ended up at centre back, it indicated how stretched we
were,'' reflected Levein.
''And Gary came on from the bench to do a fine job in midfield, before
he was asked to fulfill a makeshift task at left back.
''It was bad enough to lose an influential player like Dave early on,
but to see Neil go out of the match as well became critical.
''It's great credit to the players that they were able to adjust to
two complete reorganisations and still take something from the game.''
It seemed as though Hearts were heading for the relegation area again,
from the tightly packed mid-table area, as Killie raced to a two-goal
lead after 18 minutes.
Goalkeeper Craig Nelson looked less than confident as Steve Maskrey
drove in a rebound from the keeper in five minutes and Tom Brown's head
glance somehow squirmed in 13 minutes later.
But the resilience that Levein inspired pulled Tommy McLean's side
back from the brink with two goals inside as many minutes to ensure an
enthralling afternoon's sport.
Stephen Frail's free kick in the 29th minute offered Millar space to
beat Drago Lekovic with his fierce header and two minutes later Mackay
ended a flowing Jim Bett-Kevin Thomas move with a sweetly struck 16 yard
shot.
Nelson made amends for his earlier uncertainty when diving to his
right to push a Tom Black penalty onto the post with 19 minutes
remaining.
The direct Ally Mitchell had earned the award by forcing Millar into a
body check, and Nelson's save meant Black was missing on his second
penalty in eight years.
''We could have won the game in the end but, in fairness to
Kilmarnock, they had their opportunities late in the match as well,''
admitted Levein.
''The great thing was that on a dreadful afternoon to be out, it was a
smashing game for the supporters, with both teams still trying to win it
right up to the death.''
Alex Totten has his players happy to attack both at home and away from
Rugby Park, and consequently they are fast shedding their label as
relegation candidates.
''It was a great start to the match for us, but we couldn't get the
third goal when we were two ahead. That would have finished things
off,'' sighed Totten.
McPherson required three stitches in a shin injury and will not face a
lengthy absence, but Berry's pain in his side is less clear-cut.
Amid fears that he had suffered a collapsed lung, the former Bolton
player went for X-rays yesterday and will know the results today, with
the hope that it's simply a muscle strain.

STENHOUSEMUIR had the unusual sight on Saturday of a queue forming
outside their Ochilview ground -- even though they were not playing. It
is all part of the Scottish cup fever which has hit the club ahead of
their clash on Saturday with Aberdeen.
With Stenhousemuir's league game at Brechin off on Saturday, the
players trained at Ochilview. And when the fans heard the news, they
arrived on the hunt for cup tickets.
Chairman Terry Bulloch said yesterday: ''Because of the intense
interest we put the tickets on sale. More will be on sale on Monday when
I expect all will be taken.''

It's Valentine's Day tomorrow and with so much love in the air the
time is ripe for Joe Donnelly to recount the incredible tale of two true
romantics who happily committed body and soul to their shared passion
and saw it flourish in the coldest of climates
A LABOUR of love became a story of love, a romance of enduring
devotion. It is a tale that rivals the Bridges of Madison County in its
warmth and its ardour. It is simply a tale of two hearts.
Sentimental? Of course it is. Schmaltz it is not.
Garth and Vicky Waite fell in love with each other, with Scotland, and
more particularly, with a rocky little island battered by gales and the
tides in the Firth of Lorne.
To get there, they crossed a bridge over the Atlantic, found their
idyll on the tiny island of Easdale, and they stayed.
Romance, almost the exclusive territory of the young and excitable,
came late for the couple, their second chance of happiness which they
grabbed with fervour. Both were in their fifties, both bereaved of their
partners, when they met by accident on holiday in Scotland.
The brief encounter, a chance meeting on a train heading for the west
coast, Garth returning to places of fine childhood memory, Vicky seeking
solitude and silence, was indeed a fateful one. It sparked an interest
which led to the exchange of names and addresses, a dawning realisation
and acceptance of affinity. In less than two years they were back in
Scotland, this time on honeymoon on their enchanted island.
That first meeting on the train, as consequential as any on the Orient
Express, led to a momentous decision simply to cut and run, to give up
their past lives and start afresh on the barren little island where no
trees grow.
The one love affair sparked another, an enduring passion for the
windblown islet on the west coast, on the far side of a unique, some say
magical, old bridge. Their affair of the heart of that first year of
their life together on Easdale is recounted in Island, their book
written in affection for their home.
It is more than a book, more than a diary. It is a remarkable
collaboration of two talents, two kindred spirits who were given a
second chance of happiness and grasped it with such zest and enthusiasm
that their love was to endure. It is hard to believe, reading this
account of their adopted island, that their book was written more than a
decade ago. It is almost 20 years since Garth and Vicky's portentious
meeting on the night train heading north.
''It was in the summer of 1975, after losing her parents, that Vicky
flew to Glasgow and joined a train at Queen Street Station bound for
Oban,'' Garth recalls. ''She entered the carriage of the open-plan
variety and, much to the astonishment of the one passenger in it,
marched the full length of the carriage to sit opposite him. His name
was Garth Waite, on his way to South Uist. Both of us were eager for
adventure.
''We talked of islands, of natural history, or music. We reached Oban
that June evening and there we parted, she for Seil Island and I for
Uist. From that time until the winter of 1976 we did not meet again.''
More than a year later Vicky telephoned Garth just before Christmas.
On New Year's Day he travelled to Hove and brought her back to his house
in Welwyn, Herts, to meet his father and his son.
''She was to have stayed two nights,'' said with elaboration. ''I
would not let her return and we were married three weeks later on
January 22, 1977.''
From that day to this, Vicky and Garth have not been apart. Later that
year, for their honeymoon, they repeated their first journey, arrived on
Easdale Island where they rented a cottage for a fortnight. On one
summer day, when Garth was fishing, his new wife crept up behind him.
''What about retiring early and coming to live here?'' Garth asked for
an hour to think about it. A month later they moved into their Scottish
home, a but-and-ben 200 years old, 55 paces from the high water mark and
facing the rising sun.
It was here that the real love affair, the passion for their island
and for the surrounding countryside, really began, culminating six years
later in the most exquisitely and lovingly produced account of their
honeymoon year. And what an enormous work it became, chronicling the
life and scenery of Easdale and Seil and every exploratory trip through
the Highlands in their caravan.
The two sympathetic hearts were also ardent lovers of nature in all
its forms. Garth has been a keen naturalist since childhood, and Vicky
was gifted with a remarkable artistic talent. Combined, their gifts
enabled them to write and lavishly illustrate the story of their life.
It leaves A Year in Provence flat, if one were to be comparative. A
year on Easdale never had the comfort or the continental flavour. It
could be fierce and stormy. That first winter was the most severe in
living memory, yet they lived through it and loved it.
In his introduction to Island, in his own hand, Garth recalls: ''Set
in these idyllic surroundings, our retirement afforded us the time and
inspiration to bring about the marriage of our ambitions. Neither of us
alone could accomplish what was attainable together. Vicky took her
brush and pencil, pen and ink and clothed my ideas with colour and
script.
''What is recorded here is the journal of our first splendid year on
Easdale. It has taken us some six years to complete. In that time,
changes have occurred, a new owner, a new ferryman, several departures,
and a number of arrivals.
''The slate heart of the island does not alter.''
Vicky and Garth are a remarkable couple by any account. She was
widowed when her RAF husband was killed in a crash in Gibraltar. Garth,
deeply religious, lost his wife after a long illness in 1974. Neither
does things by halves, as the account of their romance and instant
decision shows. Together, they proved formidable and faithful
chroniclers, building up a large and disparate family of toads, cat,
donkey, and all the wild birds that could nest in and around their
garden.
Every animal, every flower that clings to the hard rock of Easdale was
observed, described, and painted in delicate watercolours, every day
condensed into a few words, equally delicate, in Vicky's careful hand.
Each day brought a new sight, from a lone heron, ''feet in the icy
water, patiently watching for a morsel'', to four mute swans flying
above the water, or a donkey feeding on a neighbour's last daffodil.
To read Island is to learn about the wildlife of Scotland's west
coast, and to comprehend the beauty in the bleakness, but the book is
more than that, bearing, as it does, not a trace of the typographer's
art -- everything is handwritten, an Edwardian Diary, an extended
holiday postcard like that Year in Provence. It is the devotion that
unfolds in the simple statements.
April 6: Found Vicky sitting on the bank painting Celandines.
June 5: Vicky's birthday. The copse rang with birdsong and we sat and
watched a tree creeper.
Simple entries speak eloquently of a couple who found each other,
beyond the bloom and excitement of youth, and were loathe to be apart,
out of each other's sight.
THEIR happiness radiates from every page, in the marvellous paintings
and sketches of plants and animals, in the words of Browning, Burns, and
MacDiarmid which spot and punctuate the days in the most fitting of
niches.
It glows, too, in the verse written by Vicky herself, in gratitude and
in praise:
Thank you for tasting, and thank you for sight,
and always the peace that one hears in the night.
But most for a partner with giving and sharing,
Exchanging a mood for the kindest of caring.
It shouts from a gloriously detailed page of watercolour flowers
simply entitled Summer Crowd.
And it endures to the last page where Garth writes: ''New Year's Eve,
Hogmanay. Going out to feed the birds, we noticed that the sun was low
in the sky and casting long shadows. Silhouetted against the pale sky, a
flock of starlings, moving as one, swerved to alight. We turned over a
few stones to find worms for Blossom the Blackbird and went back to the
warmth of the cottage.''
It was only the end of the chapter and a new year was to begin. Some
things would change. Garth and Vicky lived on Easdale until only a few
years ago when, for health reasons, they moved to another island: Cyprus
in the Mediterranean. Publishers Mainstream, who re-issue their account
in April, have been unable to trace them. Friends on the island say that
Vicky, now in her seventies, is very frail. Both are thought to be in a
nursing home in England. Their old friends on the rocky isle speak of
them fondly and remember them well.
Some things would change, but their love endures to this day, solid as
the slate heart of the island. It does not, and never will, alter.

LIFE'S tough at the top, but just ask Norrie McWhirter what it's like
at the bottom, writes Hugh McKinlay. No whirl of Saturday night
socialising for the 25-year-old St Mirren skipper in his beloved
Paisley.
He said: ''The team's doing so badly that when I leave the ground, I
just go home and stay there, and think about the game until going back
to work again on Monday. Everyone thinks it's just a game. It's not.
It's our livelihood. We turn up at work on a Monday the same as everyone
else.''
Despite his relatively tender years, McWhirter is a 10-year veteran at
Love Street, and happily admits, despite his team's present plight, that
he is ''a St Mirren man''.
He added: ''I supported this club when I was younger, and I don't like
to see them doing badly. Now I'm the captain as well, and you don't want
to lead a team that is being beaten every week. You have
responsibilities and you must show them on the park.
''It's all down to getting results now. One result -- even a draw to
pick up a point now and again -- would get us going.''
The great threatened walk-out by fans in protest against St Mirren's
displays did not help either. We were hyped up just before the match. I
could not wait to get started.''
In the end, though, the walk-out not only failed to materialise, but
the few who did leave prompted the main body of the fans to cheer even
louder for their team despite their defeat by Raith Rovers.
As the rain hammered down, Noah's Ark came to mind. All aboard two by
two, and all that. In Love Street's case, they splashed out two by two,
and only just more than a dozen of them out of a crowd of 2600.
''I knew they would stay on and cheer the team. I did not think they
would walk out. It was just the fans making a statement before the game.
We were showing 100% effort on the field, and if the fans see that,
they're quite happy,'' said McWhirter.
Towards the end, there were more chants for manager Jimmy Bone to
quit, but McWhirter is adamant: ''The gaffer's the man for the job, and
does a good job in my book. I live in Paisley, and I can see that people
are gutted with the way the team is doing.
''It means a lot to them and it's up to the players to get the
results. Jimmy Bone will pick us up. He will get us going again.''
Lack of goals, as well as giving away daft ones, are the main problem
for Saints, and it seemed a pity that McWhirter could not even enjoy the
fact that he scored his first of the season on Saturday.
He merely followed the usual plan. He went quietly home.

JUNIOR ROUND-UP
ARTHURLIE, a goal down at half-time, came back with goals from
Hendrie, Gardiner, Cairney and Tony McDonald to beat Glencairn 4-2 -- a
result which closed the gap on leaders Pollok in Central region's Reebok
League.
Pollok, meanwhile, reached the fourth round of the Whyte &amp; McKay Cup
against a disappointing Baillieston team with goals by Grainger (two),
Paisley, Mills, and Sinclair.
Scotland junior manager -- Denis Gray -- was an interested spectator
at the Shettleston v Petershill game. He couldn't help but be impressed
with Nelson and Smith of Shettleston and full back Walker of Petershill.
The game ended 2-1 to Shettleston, who led through goals from
ex-Clydebank players Paddy Kelly and Martin Nelson (penalty).
Petershill's late rally was led by full back Walker, who scored with a
diving header with five minutes remaining. Ex-Ranger Phil Bonnyman was a
late sub for Petershill. These three points leave Shettleston fourth in
the Reebok Premier Division.
In the Ayrshire region's Western League, Glenafton moved into second
position after coming from behind to beat Irvine Meadow 2-1. Cumnock's
6-0 defeat of Kello Rovers put them into second place in the second
division -- two points behind leaders Ardeer but with two games in hand.
In the East region, Bathgate scraped through in the Whyte &amp; McKay Cup
against Crossgates after having been 2-1 down. Goals by McFait and
Strange levelled the game for Bathgate. Nicol made amends for an earlier
penalty miss by scoring the winner.
Newtongrange's 1-0 win over Armadale helped them close the gap on
league leaders Camelon.
One-and-a-half games beat the weather in the Tayside region. Arbroath
SC beat Kinnoull 1-0 to leave Kinnoull deep in relegation trouble. In
the other AT and T League game, Tayport were leading 1-0 against
Montrose Roselea at half-time only for their game to be abandoned.
In the North region, Sunnybank's defeat of Lads Club in the Centenary
Trophy takes them through to a third-round tie against Bankfoot
Athletic.
FC Stoneywood stretched their unbeaten run to 11 games and their lead
at the top of the premier division to two points following their 1-0
defeat of Hall Russell.
Lewis United, in the last 16 of the OVD Scottish Cup and lying second
bottom of the premier division, lost at home to Bon Accord.
Formartine's draw at Banks o' Dee puts them three points ahead of
Hermes in the first division.
FC Stoneywood, for the fourth time this season, were the premier
division's team of the month for January and in the first division Lads
Club picked up the award.

St Mirren 1, Raith Rovers 2
CALL it the fickle side of football, but as Raith Rovers rolled
mercilessly into joint top spot in the first division and St Mirren
plunged deeper into relegation trouble because of the Fifers' 2-1 win at
Love Street, the man who has become a folk hero in Fife was sitting in
the stand.
The simple fact of the matter is that Gordon Dalziel was dropped. ''So
what?'' is the cry. He's not the first top name to suffer that problem,
and won't be the last.
But when Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl says that he's concerned that
goal difference could be a deciding factor in what is now turning into
one heck of a promotion race, then a swift look at statistics is on the
menu.
Dalziel has scored 17 goals in 26 games -- which is only three less
than the entire St Mirren squad have scored in the league all season --
and, of course, it was his ''headed'' equaliser at Ibrox which spurred
Raith to Coca-Cola Cup glory.
Dalziel, himself, remained diplomatic. ''I was told to put on a heavy
coat and sit in the stand. Of course, I'm disappointed. If I did not
feel that way, I would hang up my boots. I'll just have to wait and see
what Jimmy Nicholl says on Monday.''
After Steve Crawford's two goals had been enough to sink St Mirren at
soggy Love Street, Nicholl said: ''Now that we're up there, I should be
pleased. But we should have scored more than two, and then we gave away
a goal near the end. Goals difference definitely will be taken into
account at the end of the season.''
But what of Dalziel, who has scored 184 times for Raith since 1987?
Nicholl said: ''Yes, Dalziel was dropped. The fact that he has to suffer
this week shows how well Steve Crawford is playing. That's five goals in
four games for him. Then there's David Narey, who can't get a place, and
Colin Cameron, who can only star on the bench. It proves how well we're
doing when you have players like that who can't get a game.''
On Raith's ninth straight win -- eight of them in the league -- he
added: ''We must keep getting the points. We face a horrific finish to
the season with our last five games against Airdrie, Dundee, St
Johnstone, Dunfermline, and Hamilton.''
Saints manager Jimmy Bone would love to have Nicholl's worries. Ayr's
victory against leaders Dundee not only tightened the promotion race, it
put the Paisley men a step nearer relegation.
But Bone refused to criticise his side too heavily. ''You cannot give
away early goals and hope to win a game. Our effort and commitment was
good, but we're playing without any confidence, and losing that goal
just before half-time to go in 2-0 down certainly did not help.''
Bone, who praised the fans for remaining loyal despite the threatened
walk-out, added: ''Ayr's victory now makes it that wee bit more
difficult, but there are still 11 games to go, and we have the ability.
The players won't lose that, but we must try to cut out the errors and
get more belief in ourselves.''
Scotland Under-21 internationalist Crawford -- who will be named today
in the Scotland B squad for next week's game against Northern Ireland --
certainly looked sharp, converting a Shaun Dennis flick after only four
minutes, and then taking advantage of a bad pass-back by Martin Baker to
score what proved to be the killer goal seconds before the interval.
Brave goalkeeping by Campbell Money and some slackness on his own part
denied Crawford what should have been at least a hat trick.
As Bone said, the effort from Saints was there for all to see, but the
vital spark which can mean the difference between success and failure is
definitely missing.
Being second to the ball for the majority of the afternoon is a polite
way of showing how much the young Saints were out-classed.
Skipper Norrie McWhirter scored his first goal of the season a minute
from time, but by then, there was no way back for Saints.

CHRISTOPHER Columbus seems tame by comparison.
Forty-two-year-old former French naval diver Guy Delage walked ashore
in Barbados, and in surprisingly good shape, after becoming the first
person to swim nearly 2000 miles -- alone -- across the Atlantic.
A solitary French flag had been planted in the sand. His wife
Catherine and his son Clement were in the water to greet him. Police
held back a crowd of several hundred, while television crews and
journalists came to blows for the privilege of the first words and
pictures of a man who for two months had enjoyed only the company of
fish.
Delage hoped to join the ranks of France's other great solitary
eccentrics such as Louis Bleriot, who flew across the Channel in 1909,
and navigator Alain Bombard, who crossed the Atlantic in 1952 in an
inflatable dinghy. But by remaining embarrassingly silent about Delage's
exploit, leading sportsmen and scientists have appeared to condemn it.
Barely back on dry land, Delage has plunged into a snide controversy
about the genuine worth and scientific interest of his marathon swim.
Delage set off from Cape Vert, off the coast of West Africa, on
December 16, pushing a small inflated raft, containing food and drink
and carrying a rifle for shooting sharks. The latter was used in the
fight between journalists after his arrival in Barbados.
He swam between six and eight hours a day, towing a dinghy on which he
slept at night. His specially designed goggles gave him 180 degrees
vision and special flippers provided 30% extra thrust. His wetsuit also
had been designed for the swim, using materials which provided both
considerable freedom of movement and exceptional insulation.
Delage was criticised from the outset for the use of the dinghy which,
by bobbing along on the current, pushed him towards Latin America at no
effort.
He was caricatured in the press. Had he not spent the first two days
of the crossing huddling on his dinghy, struggling with seasickness? Had
he not then cut his fingers, opening a can of sausages and beans? The
anti-shark rifle caused hilarity although Delage did claim he frightened
off a shark by hitting it on the nose with a flipper.
Only days into the swim, Delage's monitoring equipment broke down,
meaning that little scientific information about his general health,
physical performance and resistance to so many hours in the sea --
information often used as justification for the crossing -- was
broadcast back to France.
When Delage arrived in Barbados, he provoked suspicion by leaving his
dinghy out of sight, claiming the water was too shallow to bring it into
shore. Reporters, hoping to see a haggard figure struggling half dead to
dry land, were disappointed to see Delage walk up the beach quite
normally, once again accustomed to gravity.
Psychiatrists consulted by several newspapers about the former navy
officer's transatlantic performance tended to come down on his side.
One, Dr Michele Reynaud, ruled out suggestions Delage was insane and
compared his achievement to other, highly unusual but less publicised
feats of endurance such as mountain climbing -- cold, painful,
punishing, and for some, deeply rewarding.
Another, Dr Eric Piel, was more circumspect. He said that anyone who
wanted to swim across the Atlantic must have relational difficulties,
and that all Delage's talk of scientific experimentation was a
smokescreen. In reality, he just enjoyed doing it.
For this was far from being Delage's first publicity grabbing exploit.
Aged 18, he swam across the Channel, apparently to impress a girlfriend
living in England.
In 1978, he came first in the Route du Rhum boat race, sailing a
12-metre boat he had designed himself. In 1981, he came second in the
New York to Brest boat race. In 1991, he flew alone across the Atlantic
in an ultralight aircraft, but failed to attract the media attention he
was after.
The Legion d'Honneur medal, France's highest award, may still be out
of sight. But there is no doubt that Delage enjoyed himself in his own
unusual way.
''Having experienced terror in an ultralight aircraft, I wanted to
experience pain. It is better to die in the jaws of a shark than in
bed,'' he said.

INVESTMENT bank Kleinwort Benson is understood in a report expected
today to forecast that UK house prices will rise only at the level of
inflation over the next five years and will not increase at all in real
terms.
The report goes much further than any other assessment of the housing
market with most of the major housing forecasters, including the Halifax
and Nationwide building societies, confining themselves to the outlook
for the current year. On this basis, house prices are projected to rise
by about 2% to 3% in 1995, mirroring retail prices.
Kleinwort says, though, that house prices have not yet completed the
correction that began in 1989 when average house prices peaked at more
than 10 times per-capita national income. They have since fallen back to
7.5 times income but Kleinwort considers that they will fall to 6.5
times income between now and 1999. It draws a parallel with the 1950s
when house prices fell in real terms for 10 years.
All are agreed that the housing market remains, at best, flat with no
real evidence of recovery. Housing analysts at NatWest Securities have
suggested that house price inflation will eventually reappear but
suspect that it will not be until after the next election that a
material rise in prices is experienced.
In the meantime, low wage growth, low employment growth, high real
interest rates and faltering consumer confidence are expected to hold
down house prices. Furthermore, the analysts say, the UK housing market
has never had to cope with rising mortgage rates at the same time as a
lack of price momentum within the market.
Kleinwort also warns that demographic trends are very negative. An
aversion to taking on debt is still widespread, job insecurity has grown
and the tax system is much less favourable for house purchase. And, of
course, interest rates are on their way up at a time when there are
difficulties enough in the housing market.

THAT familiar old condition, Scottish Cup fever, broke out in alarming
fashion in Huntly yesterday. The Highland League club with a habit of
going on giant-killing runs put their tickets on sale for the impending
clash with holders Dundee United -- and within an hour their allocation
was sold out.
Some fans had queued for almost two hours to secure a share of the
2000 briefs.
They would have been happy enough to get up early anyway, having seen
their team take another important step towards a second consecutive
championship. Huntly won 3-0 at challengers Elgin City thanks to goals
from Brian Thomson, his thirtieth of the season, and a double from Gary
Whyte.
Deveronvale debut defender Stewart Cameron had to be rushed to
hospital during the match against Buckie Thistle. The 19-year-old
suffered heart palpitations only five minutes into the game and was
taken to the cardiac unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
Vale player-manager Kevin Bremner said: ''Obviously, it's a bit of a
worry, but it's happened to him before and he knew what to do.''
Doctors are still not sure what causes the problem, but Cameron's
footballing future is not thought to be in danger.
Bremner and Ross McLean both hit hat tricks as Vale routed Buckie 6-0.
Sammy Leonce gave Forres an early lead at Brora Rangers, but they had
to settle for a draw after having two players sent off.
Neil Nicol was red-carded for bringing down Brora's David Ross, who
got up to equalise from the resulting penalty. Then Andy Mathieson was
sent off for a second bookable offence only minutes after coming on as a
sub.
In the only other Highland game to survive the weather, Fort William
won through to the semi-finals of the North Cup after becoming the first
team this season to beat Caley Thistle reserves. Mike McEachan and Tom
Drummond set Fort on the way to a 2-0 win.

End of a Rolls-Royce lifestyle
As a union delegation flies out today to convince German colleagues at
BMW Rolls-Royce that RR's planned redundancies in East Kilbride could
pose a threat to their future, GAVIN BELL talks to two men whose hopes
for their families and their lifestyles have been already blighted by
the news. Where do they go from here?
THE Rolls-Royce plant in East Kilbride was opened on November 20,
1953, by the then Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. The 60,000 sq ft
complex was built in 15 months and was the town's biggest single
industrial unit at the time. It opened with 2600 employees, most of them
Scots, and there were plans to increase the workforce to 3,500 in the
following year.
Last month the company confirmed that it is to close its engineering
research and development facility at East Kilbride, and transfer the
work to Bristol and Derby. It said it needed to cut costs to compete in
the aero-engine market, and announced that 500 designers and engineers
and 100 shopfloor and store workers would be paid off. The rundown is
expected to begin in May and be completed by the end of the year,
leaving 1,000 jobs at the East Kilbride plant.
Almost half of the town's population of 70,000 is employed locally,
and the jobless rate of 7% is below national and regional levels -- but
the ratio of job seekers to vacancies is still 6:1.
THE DESIGN ENGINEER
We fear Bob won't find work in the area and we will be split up.
WHEN Bob McCallum landed a job with Rolls-Royce as a design engineer,
he felt he had stepped firmly on to the ladder of a successful career.
He resigned his position with Volvo trucks in Irvine, and was grateful
when his new employer helped him find a pleasant three-bedroomed
terraced house in East Kilbride for his young family.
After four years with the company, he bought the rented house last
November, and spent #5000 installing central heating and new windows,
and redecorating. At Christmas, he told his wife Karen that things were
looking good. He was earning steady overtime on an urgent project, and
maybe they could take the children on a Spanish holiday this year.
In the RR drawing offices, he was impressed by the team spirit of his
colleagues working on the successful V2500 engines.
But the illusions of security and relative affluence vanished abruptly
on the morning of January 19. A Herald report had alerted Bob to
impending staff cuts, but he was ''absolutely gobsmacked'' when he
learned the extent of them. The news was broken to 120 staff in Z block,
the development design and administration centre, by Keith Bradshaw,
chief design engineer. ''The room was dead silent,'' Bob recalls.
''Keith was quite emotional, saying he couldn't believe it and he was as
shocked as we were. I was devastated. I'd always thought Rolls-Royce was
as safe as you could get, that it was a job for life. Bob decided not to
phone his wife. ''I thought it would be better to wait till I got home,
so I could sit her down and give her a cup of tea and tell her not to
worry, that I'd find something else. She was very good about it, though
I couldn't hide that I was worried.
''But the full impact didn't sink in that first day. I suppose I was
in a state of shock. Even the next morning when I woke up, I thought:
did I dream that?
''We've always been very proud of what we do, but it's hard to
maintain any enthusiasm for a company that no longer wants or needs
you,'' Bob says. ''I've still got work on my drawing board, and I still
attend meetings, but . . .''
His voice trails off, and he stares into space. ''The commitment has
gone. ''It's been kicked out of us. Some feel we should try and fight
this decision, and there's no doubt the union has a very strong case,
but I don't see the management changing course.
''A few of the guys say they're going to hang on to get full
redundancy, but I don't think that's sensible. The job market in my
profession is fairly fluid just now, but God knows what it'll be like in
September when there are hundreds looking for work. I'd rather get
another job now if I can, and plan the future.''
So, instead of browsing through Iberian holiday brochures, the
McCallums are spending the winter months scanning the ''situations
vacant'' columns. With his skills and experience, Bob is hopeful of
finding new employment, but there are no guarantees in an uncertain
economic climate, and he fears he may have to uproot his family again.
Karen says: ''Our big worry is that Bob won't find work in the area,
and the family will be split up. The problem is we can't sell the house
for two years because we bought it at a discount, so if Bob has to work
far away he'll have to go on his own. That's the worst of it, the
uncertainty. What's going to happen to us?''

THE 77 top directors of privatised electricity companies have awarded
themselves share options worth a total of #72m, according to Labour
Party research published last night.
Labour claimed that the figure amounted to a charge of just above #4
for every household in the country.
The figures show that 12 directors, together with a small number of
senior executives at the generating companies PowerGen and National
Power have options worth #22,901,856 between them.

OH dear. What has happened to the Novosibirsk Philharmonic Orchestra
since its last visit to Glasgow some years ago?
An orchestral personality transplant? Jet lag? Were we sent the
reserve squad for what was one of the poorest concerts given by any
visiting orchestra since the Glasgow hall opened five years ago?
There was almost no resemblance between the way the Siberian orchestra
played last night and on its previous visit.
I recall the sound -- big, attacking, red-blooded, full-bodied. This
wasn't even a pale shadow. The entire night was a catalogue of
disappointments.
I have never heard Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kije Suite played with such
diffidence and lack of bite; it was almost tentative -- it actually
suggested (a suspicion that returned throughout a desperate evening) a
total lack of confidence in the direction of conductor Arnold Katz.
Next disappointment: the cancellation (without explanation) of
Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto. The substitute, Shostakovich's Second,
is a brilliant piece, true. But alas it was not played that way.
Pianist Paul Crossley, usually tight and incisive, seemed to lack the
steely brilliance the music requires. The slow movement brought the one
genuinely lovely moment of the evening.
Those of us who had heard the band last time round clung onto the hope
that Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition in the second half would see
the Siberians galvanised.
'Fraid not: stiff-necked, monochrome, rotten orchestral balance, and
some ropy playing.
Arnold Katz has been in charge of this orchestra for nearly 40 years.
That's a long time. Maybe it's too long. The orchestra sounded low key,
grim, and demoralised.

RANGERS, like Old Firm rivals Celtic, are ready to plunder the
value-for-money Dutch transfer market as they bid to strengthen their
squad for next season's assault on Europe.
Walter Smith, who watched his side go down 2-0 to Roy Aitken's
revitalised Aberdeen at Pittodrie yesterday, has earmarked Rob Mackaay,
the teenage star of Vitesse Arnhem and a protege of former Dutch star
Franz Thijssen.
Mackaay will not be 20 until next month, but already he is tipped for
full international honours with Holland. Thijssen, whose skills graced
the English first division, has personally coached the youngster since
he joined Vitesse from Nijmegen two years ago.
The man who is now a member of the backroom staff with the Arnhem club
admits: ''His talents are amazing. He has played for the Olympic team
already and it is only a matter of time before he moves into the full
national side.''
Arnhem know of Rangers' interest and are ready to slap a #2m price tag
on the forward. I understand the Scottish champions have watched the
player several times this season with assistant manager Archie Knox and
coach Billy Kirkwood both making hush-hush visits to Holland.
Mackaay can play in any of the front positions but his performances
wide on the right have impressed the Ibrox spies.
A source in Holland explained to me last night: ''Initially, it was
thought Rangers were watching Glen Helder, who may be signing for
Arsenal. Then we realised that Mackaay was their target.
''He is a very direct player, and the work Franz Thijssen has put in
on his coaching is now paying off. Rangers have seen this early and they
are first in line to buy the player.''
Rangers manager Walter Smith has Jesper Blomquist of Gothenburg
already in his sights, but now Mackaay has joined the Swede on the
Rangers' shopping list.
Celtic, of course, have already signed giant striker Pierre van
Hooydonk from Holland, and manager Tommy Burns has claimed that the fees
there are much more realistic than, for instance, England.
However, though Swedish captain Jonas Thern insists that he wants to
play his football at Ibrox next season, he will not be in Glasgow for
signing talks this week.
Meanwhile, Aberdeen's caretaker manager Aitken immediately set his
players fresh targets following their defeat of the champions.
For Aitken, ever-demanding as a player, is clearly going to carry that
trait into his management career.
Last night he was clearly happy to get the victory, but happier still
to move up two places in the Premier League.
Now he wants his team to continue a surge up the table and away from
the relegation threat which brought Willie Miller the sack.
After the match he pointed out: ''We jumped two places in the league
with this win.
''But it is more important for us to look at the other places which
could be jumped in the coming weeks!''
He added: ''It would be nit-picking to talk about penalty decisions.
We deserved to win.
''I told the players before the game that if they gave me their best
then that would be enough to win the match. They have proved in the past
that they are a good side. Now we have to continue to make progress.''
Disappointed Rangers manager Smith revealed: ''Trevor Steven was
injured in training on Saturday morning. He has a hip injury and it
would have been impossible for him to play at Pittodrie. We hope to have
him back for the Cup game against Hearts.
''We have no complaints about the result though I would say the
penalty turned the game.''
The demonstrations which some Aberdeen fans had threatened came to
nothing. At the end there were some chants of Willie Miller's name but
the victory really took any heat out of protests which might have been
aimed at the chairman Ian Donald.

STEPHEN Innes is in revolt. Against style and against preconceptions
about disability, not least those that tend to be projected by the
disabled themselves.
Innes, 29, a disabled photographer, whose first exhibition is showing
at the Project Ability gallery, issued a press statement that has an
edge to it. He declared himself ''fed up'' with the ''hackneyed image''
of disabled people. Exhibitions of work by disabled people, he said,
tended to show what a rotten time they were all having, their work
portraying a sense of anger, rejection, or isolation.
''Well you won't get that from me,'' he stated, though in conversation
at the opening of his exhibition, he confided he was a little concerned
about being seen as stroppy.
''Even still,'' he said, ''getting into the Necropolis at night
through a hole in the gates, and climbing up to the top with tons of
equipment to get a picture of Glasgow Cathedral, while wondering if
you're going to be mugged, does require a certain physical dexterity and
determination.''
Innes's revolt against style is hinted at in the title of his
exhibition -- Dye Hard. Is this Bruce Willis with a Canon? ''Not at
all,'' he laughed, confessing a penchant for ''dreadful puns''. (His
photograph of a shaggily golden Highland bull, which has found fame as a
postcard, is entitled Matted d'Or.)
''My main problem with photography exhibitions is that black and white
has enjoyed a resurgence to the point that it has become de rigueur,''
he said. Innes's favoured form of photography is the colour slide.
''It's such an exacting discipline; one mistake and the slide is
ruined.''
Some of the photos in his exhibition -- a wide-ranging display of 23
pictures -- suggest trickery or clever use of filters: a spectacularly
dramatic night portrait of the Forth Rail Bridge, or the witty and
whimsical Ghost Bus, another night portrait, where the spirit of a
number 62D on the Clydeside expressway has been left imprinted after the
bus has moved on.
Not so. Innes eschews filters. ''They're a pain in the backside; they
give internal reflections and detract from the finished effect.'' His
effects are all achieved by timed exposures: ''that and the inherent
ability of the lens. All my lenses I've known for a long time; each has
a slightly different signature and I know its ability.''
By day Stephen Innes mans a BBC Radio Helpline (''I'm a grease
monkey'') and by night you're likely to find him clambering up a
near-unassailable height in search of his next target, armed with his
indispensable Canon F1n and Mamiya C330. Loaded of course. Dye Hard
indeed.
* Dye Hard, sponsored by Studio Trust, is at the Project Ability
Centre, 18 Albion Street, 10am to 5pm Monday to Friday until March 3.

Glasgow's gallery street is booming -- but does the budget stretch to
the art?
AFTER five years in Glasgow's High Street, Street Level, the city's
only specialist photography venue, is installed in its new home at the
corner of King Street and Parnie Street with its first members' show
Momentary Views: Contemporary Images From The Landscape.
Situated below Glasgow Print Studio and beside Transmission Gallery,
both well-known internationally, it now forms a block which is ''the
cultural quarter of Glasgow'', according to a university sociologist who
wrote to Transmission's Will Bradley recently.
Street Level must be rejoicing. It has a prime site with glossy
gallery and extra darkrooms, colour film processing room, library, and
offices. However the exhibition disappoints. Most of the images are very
dull: untitled, small, grey, confused, confusing, vacant, and
communicate little to the viewer. Once again bricks and mortar have
superseded the art.
It's a perennial problem. Good graduates are ambitious, dedicated, and
want to keep working in their chosen medium: sculpture, print, paint,
photography, whatever. Equipment is too expensive to buy individually so
they form a group. Then they need premises -- so artists turn into
administrators to make it happen, learning how to fill in forms and deal
with builders, plumbers, council officials, and the dreaded VAT. Soon
the art is out of the window while inevitable bureaucracy slides in
under the door. This may happen in other professions, but usually not at
the start of careers.
You would think by now, with the plethora of artists' workshops,
studios, and galleries springing up all over the place, there should be
a way of employing adminstrators to adminstrate. But then they wouldn't
work for peanuts like artists do, would they?
I am a great admirer of Street Level. In small premises they did
wonderful things, putting on good shows and providing excellent
facilities and an enterprising education programme. I'm sure they will
do so again. Meantime top photographers have been too busy painting
walls to make prints -- and also too busy to chase and cajole less
committed members who grumble about lack of recognition but never get
round to submitting work.
Street Level's director, Martha McCulloch, was Glasgow Art School's
very first fine art photo graduate back in 1984. She and her team,
mostly volunteers, have relocated to a #200,000 new home with a mere
#75,000 to achieve #148,000 worth of renovation and conversion. How?
''By negotiating half-price materials; getting the donation of
professional services and volunteer labour, and using folk doing
community service to do the joinery.'' She admits their timing was bad.
''The Scottish Arts Council's Housing the Arts fund is running down and
lottery money is not yet onstream.'' Street Level's SAC grant has been
increased by #5000 to #46,000 for 1995/96 but, with three times the
space, that won't go far.
Are they being too ambitious? ''There are hundreds of camera clubs but
none has similar facilities,'' says McCulloch.
Philosophically the exhibitions reads well: ''Land in panorama or in
minute detail; as dispassionate topography or as metaphor . . . a
fundamental fusion of time and space.'' The reality is otherwise with
most of the 25 members represented showing precocious bits of sky, oddly
angled twigs, or glimpses of blurred horizon. There is little to look
at, little to get your teeth into; too many clever shadows, too few
memorable images.
There are exceptions. John McManus's junk vernacular roadside fence
made from oil drums and any old iron; Annette Heyer's giant fingers
twisting twine; Stewart Shaw's Glasgow 1990 showing what's left of the
old Glasgow Print Studio facade in Ingram Street; Kathleen Little's
running, falling nude; Kevin McCourt's Sierra Nevada overlaid with blue
rectangulars.
McCulloch herself shows a fascinating compilation of ancient Irish map
and shoreline border. Its significance for her lies in her Irish/Scots
ancestry, and how her family's migration reflects a bigger history.
Notable too are colour shots taken by Eric Botfield, Mary Birse, and
Marion McDonald as part of a project at Cowglen Hospital. After all the
monochromatic telegraph poles and tarmac, they at least concern
themselves with the stuff of landscape: green grass, leaves, and
flowers.
In 1989 the artists-run Transmission Gallery next door was still on an
arts council grant of #5700. ''We couldn't afford to print posters,''
says Will Bradley.
Now with #25,000 from the SAC, its funding is still modest. ''But we
don't pay salaries, so we end up with enough to run an exciting
programme,'' he explains. Why are these young artists prepared to work
unpaid for two years? ''It's a really good way of being involved:
worthwhile and rewarding. We learn a lot of new skills and, as the
committee of five rotates, we learn from the others.''
The formula has worked exceedingly well. Now 11 years old,
Transmission has a worldwide reputation. The ''others'' include Borland,
Gordon, Roberts, and Roddy Buchanan (who shows at Glasgow Print Studio
in March). Indeed most of Scotland's top young artists now have
connections with Transmission.
Transmission's reputation entices famous folk like American Lawrence
Weiner and Chilean Eugenio Dittborn to show with them and I was much
impressed by Dittborn's January exhibition. Making Out, till February
18, is less coherent if not a bit ramshackle, but as all nine exhibitors
are just out of college, perhaps that's not surprising. Four cities --
Berlin, Paris, London, and Glasgow -- are represented. Glasgow is way
ahead: Joanne Tatham and Tom O'Sullivan photograph each other in strange
landscapes bathed in unnatural light; Brigid Teehan also uses
photography, via 1970s found images.
Video is a notoriously difficult medium and neither effort here is
memorable although Ward Pilarsky's notion of low budget special effects
via marshmallows and blow-torch is a nice idea. Mark Jones's long-legged
chair works better than his carpet tiles while Tim Marr's scrawled magic
marker text I am a Hotel; I am a Weekend reminds us, as if we could
forget, that the 1990s is the era when Glasgow's Centre for Contemporary
Arts would have us believe that even suicide notes constitute art.

Islamabad, Sunday
MADONNA and Michael Jackson should be tried in Pakistan as terrorists,
a religious party official demanded today.
''Michael Jackson and Madonna are the torchbearers of American
society, their cultural and social values,'' said Party of Islam
spokesman Nematullah Khan.
''They are ruining the lives of thousands of Muslims and leading them
to destruction, away from their religion, ethics and morality.''
His outburst follows the arrest of a suspect in the bombing of the
World Trade Centre in New York, Ramzi Yousef, who was seized last
Tuesday at a hotel in Islamabad and extradicted to New York.
The New York blast in February 1993 left six dead and 1000 injured.
The Islamic party local chief also called on Britain and Sweden to
extradite authors Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin, both accused by
hardline Muslims of insulting Islam and both threatened with death.
''These people have hurt the feelings and religious beliefs of
millions of Muslims all over the world,'' said Khan.
The Party of Islam, which is fiercely anti-American, barely manages to
win three or four parliamentary seats in elections in Pakistan. However
political leaders are wary of them because of their ability to mobilise
public opinion.
Meanwhile, the official Iranian news agency Irna issued a
clarification today, dropping a reference to an alleged call by a deputy
minister for the killing of British novelist Salman Rushdie.
However, Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi said in remarks quoted
by Irna that the religious edict, or fatwa, that Iran's late leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued for killing Rushdie could not be
revoked.
The rare clarification highlights the fine line the Tehran government
is treading over the Rushdie affair which has marred its relations with
several Western countries.
Last Thursday, reporting from Paris where Vaezi had a stopover on his
way home from Denmark, Irna said he ''underlined the need for the
implementation of the fatwa against the writer of the blasphemous book
The Satanic Verses' (Rushdie)'' in an interview with the agency.
Today Irna said because ''different interpretations'' had been made of
that report, it was publishing the full text of Vaezi's reply to a
question about his talks in Denmark:
''In my meetings with the Danish officials, I explicitly expressed the
stance of the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) in this regard. I
emphasised that the fatwa issued on Rushdie is based on Islamic
principles and has received the confirmation of the Islamic states at
the OIC (Organisation of the Islamic Conference) foreign ministers'
conference and is therefore irrevocable.''
Iran has repeatedly said the edict, issued almost exactly six years
ago, is a purely religious matter, unrelated to the Iranian government.
Senior Iranian leaders have said Tehran would not actively pursue
Rushdie, 47.--AP/Reuter.

David Belcher meets pop culture's Renaissance man, Bob Last.
GALVANISING has long been a good word to describe the electric Bob
Last. For the past 15 years he has been inducing sudden and startling
responses across popular culture's widest spectrum from his Edinburgh
base. Beginning in the music business, he founded Fast Product in order
to ''play around with people's expectations; introduce what are seen as
difficult ideas into what is popular and commercial . . . but without
seeking to popularise them, which I see as twee and condescending.
''Back then, in the punk era, it was all about turning your back on
business, but at Fast the creation of record sleeves and the subversion
of notions about management and marketing were as much fun as making
music. You could make just as many points with them.''
Scotland's pointed riposte to a set of questions raised but never
answered by Malcolm McLaren, Bob Last initially piloted the Rezillos to
chart success before hitting the pop jackpot with the Human League, ABC,
Scritti Politti, and Heaven 17. ''Being in the music business was always
an accident, and five or six years ago I decided I'd had enough fun and
there was nothing left to do but get rich -- and I'd already done that.
''Made a lot of money and lost a lot of money. I'd worked with pop
stars who'd defined a moment -- and how do you deal with continually
recreating it? It's a nightmare.''
Given an entre by his music interests, Last was led into film, art,
and TV. Film-wise, he has most recently supervised the music for Orlando
and Backbeat, the Beatles bio-pic. He is sound-supervisor for BBC's
Cardiac Arrest. With the BFI's Colin McCabe, he has spent the past two
years co-producing a large pan-global series of TV documentaries on the
centenary of cinema, each documentary being directed by stellar names
including Stephen Frears, Jean Luc Godard, George Miller, and Martin
Scorsese.
And Bob Last has also been creating art installations, the most recent
of which, Fear, has newly opened in Edinburgh's Collective Gallery.
Fittingly, two newly-galvanised 6ft sheet-metal Greek letters -- alpha
and omega -- form part of the work, the bulk of which exists as moving
projections on the gallery's walls.
Ceaseless water droplets; repetitious film loops. What are we to make
of them? If we choose to make a bit of an effort to make something of
them, we are free to make of them what we will, is Last's gnomic credo.
''There's no definitive, 'correct' understanding, in the same way that
one of pop's strengths is the personal interpretation that fans have of
music or place on a performer. Struggling to say what something means .
. . it's obnoxious.
''You could look at my use of alpha and omega as simple images or
portentous ones. As ever, I'm playing around with people's expectations.
There's a lot of stuff about time in the installation. Galvanising a
metal defeats the effects of time, so maybe the letters are clues for a
way in to the rest of the work. Yet simultaneously, I see a challenge in
the way art is continually used to embody a definitive, overwhelming
statement. I am much more ironic.
''So while the water droplets in my video are an endless repetition,
water eventually evaporates. Or maybe watching the trickling droplets is
simply like watching a lava lamp. Maybe they give you a different
perspective, maybe not. The whole can be an unsettling environment if
you let it. Or calming. Pretty, or contemplative, or threatening, like
the evil drops in the eyeball-slashing sequence in Un Chien Andalou.
''And the repetition is important, in that you can take everything in
at a glance without having to look for half-an-hour. In the same way, a
child's repetition of a word can stop it meaning anything. I've found
that with video art, people impose literal demands that they don't with
still pieces of art, probably due to their exposure to TV. With Fear,
I'm not telling any stories. I'm showing that there are non-narrative
ways of using moving images.''
Bob Last will next be involved in the narrative use of moving images
as Hollywood producer of a forthcoming United Artists movie, Hackers. He
has a hush-hush involvement in Martin Scorsese's next project, and is
also developing a series of short TV essays which will unite global
movie mega-stars with their less well-kent admirers in the avant garde
arts (''the ideal would be Ian Hamilton-Finlay meets Bruce Willis'').
And he does have one story to tell about his previous video-art
installation, in one of London's more unusual public spaces. ''I set up
a tower of monitors atop one of the lifts in Greenwich Foot Tunnel,
150ft down, playing videos on the shaft walls as the lift went up and
down. It should have been secure, but one night a would-be thief climbed
down and wrecked it. I can't wait to see the footage on the security
video . . .''
* Fear was commissioned by the Fringe Film and Video Festival for
their tenth anniversary exhibition, and can be seen at Edinburgh's
Collective Gallery in Cockburn Street until March 4, alongside video
installations by Alan Currall and Bryndis Snaebjornsdottir.

* DEFENDING champions Barcelona plunged to a humiliating 5-0 defeat on
Saturday against lowly Racing Santander, third from bottom of the
Spanish first division.
Last year's European Cup finalists, missing three key men through
injury and suspension, finished the match with just nine players after
Albert Ferrer and goalkeeper Carlos Busquets were both sent off.
It ended a miserable week for coach Johan Cruyff who saw his side
crash 4-1 at home to Atletico Madrid in the Spanish Cup on Tuesday.

THIRD DIVISION
JIMMY Crease knows a bit about the resurrection business, having been
in charge of Berwick Rangers when they climbed back from near-extinction
to their present respectable status as challengers for a place in the
first division, so he seems singularly well equipped for the job of
steering Albion Rovers from the foot of Scottish football's basement.
Although player-coach Joe McBride picked the team on Saturday, Crease
was able to see what he is up against as the Rovers' new manager. They
lost 2-1 at home to Caledonian Thistle and it was the usual hard-luck
story.
Both keepers were required to make good saves early on, and it was a
mistake by the home side's David McDonald that allowed Norman MacMillan
to open for the Inverness team in 28 minutes. With quarter of an hour to
go, Rovers were awarded a penalty, but Martin Scott missed. Eight
minutes from time McBride did score, his 20-yarder taking a helpful
deflection, but just two minutes later Martin Lisle headed in a Colin
Mitchell free kick and Rovers were left once again to muse on what might
have been.
At least they have tasted victory at home, over Queen's Park, who went
to Gayfield on Saturday wary that they might also provide Arbroath with
a first home win of the season. But, with no goals after 54 minutes the
match was abandoned.
As manager Bill Lamont knows only too well, Alloa have a habit of
giving the opposition not one goal of a start but two. They did it in
the cup-tie against Ross County at Alloa, which they lost 3-2, and they
did it again on Saturday at Dingwall -- and went down 6-0.
Former Aberdeen player Andy McLeod had put County 2-0 up but towards
half-time Alloa gave themselves two self-inflicted wounds. Neil Bennett
and Willie Newbigging were sent off in quick succession, and the nine
men were swamped in the second half. Brian Grant hit a second-half
double, Gordon Connelly found the net, and substitute Alan Duff
completed the rout. County are now only two points behind leaders
Forfar.

THE decision by Tommy Burns to drop team captain Paul McStay for the
premier division match against Hibs on Saturday is a clear sign that the
patience of the quiet-spoken Celtic manager is running out.
Burns refused to go into depth about his decision, but it can be
assumed that the removal of McStay was the first warning to the
established internationalists that he has not been at all satisfied with
their performances this season.
Even in his praise of John Collins' showing against Hibs, the manager
gave a hint that he, too, was due to step up the quality of his work.
''John played well, but we need much more of that from him.''
McStay was still not willing to discuss the matter yesterday. ''I
really would prefer not to say anything until I have digested
everything,'' he told me. But it did not need the deductive powers of Mr
Holmes to work out that he was an angry man at being left out to make
way for one of the bright young things at Parkhead, Brian McLaughlin.
The captain had only just returned to the side at Motherwell last week
after a two-game suspension, when McLaughlin was left out to accommodate
him, and, although he had taken a slight knock, he was fit to play.
''I chose the team I wanted to play for this match,'' said Burns,
''These decisions have to be made but they are between me and the
players.''
Speculation about McStay's future is bound to be a consequence of the
weekend action, but Burns is more likely to have taken the decision to
make the well-paid internationalist aware that much more is expected of
him than has been the case in recent months.
McStay, whose contract runs out at the end of the season, has already
made it clear that he wants to stay with Celtic for the rest of his
career, and Burns also would like that to be the case.
However, by his action, the manager has indicated to his captain that
nothing is written in stone.
He will expect McStay to prove to the Celtic supporters as well as the
management that he is ready to lead the club into the promised new era.
Only Peter Grant, the much criticised, long-serving Parkhead man, has
been a consistent success in the heart of the side, and Burns has been
disappointed that his form has not been matched regularly by the three
internationalists alongside him, McStay, Collins, and Phil O'Donnell.
There are other established men who also can be sure that the quality
of their play has to improve or they, too, will be given the shock
treatment that McStay suffered at the weekend.
He may have a studious, mild appearance but Burns was never anybody's
push-over as a player.
He can bare his teeth with the best of them. Paul McStay will not be
the last of the current squad to find this out.

THE STOREMAN
THE terraced house of Peter and Jean Gildea in East Kilbride is a
tribute to the endeavours of a hard-working couple to provide a decent
life for themselves and their children. It is distinguished from its
neighbours by a smart white porch around a cottage-style door with
leaded glass windows. Inside it is warm and cosy, the lounge furniture
new and comfortable.
When they moved in two years ago, it seemed their future was secure.
The mortgage was well within their budget, as both were employed by
Rolls-Royce, and there was enough left to run a car and take their two
young daughters on regular holidays.
''We were doing fine,'' Peter recalls. ''We bought the house on the
understanding that Rolls-Royce was a reliable employer, and we felt safe
and secure.'' They were soon to be cruelly disillusioned.
The first blow fell a year ago when Jean received an ''at risk''
letter from management. After almost 20 years with the company as a
telephonist and a supervisor, she was informed of impending staff cuts
in the computer department in which she was working. Her services were
no longer required, and she had a week in which to appeal against the
decision. She didn't bother.
''I never went back,'' she says. ''A week later somebody came round
and gave me my redundancy, which was less than a year's wages, and that
was the end of it.''
The first intimation that worse was to come was a radio news bulletin.
It was 7 am on Thursday, January 19. Jean was rousing her elder daughter
for school, and she caught the end of an announcement about redundancies
at Rolls-Royce on her daughter's clock-radio. Her husband's initial
reaction was disbelief. ''It cannae be us,'' he said. ''It must be
Hillington.''
On arriving at the plant, where he has worked for eight years as a
warehouse operator, he found the place in a ferment with groups of
worried men discussing the news. ''Some said it was just a rumour, but
others said they had read it in The Herald. Then I knew it must be
right, it must be East Kilbride, and my heart sank.''
Yet the mood of disbelief persisted. ''The men were still saying it
couldn't be us. We knew the company was going through a lean period, and
we were bending over backwards to help and be flexible -- we'd even
given up a wage rise a couple of years ago. We didn't see what more we
could do.''
Soon, a member of the management came to the warehouse. He stood on a
wooden pallet, surrounded by crates of parts for RB-211 engines, and
read a prepared statement to a fearful gathering of about 100.
''When he started on about rationalisation you could see the faces
dropping,'' Peter recalls. ''When he read out the numbers of
redundancies you could hear the gasps. Two lassies beside me started
crying. Then he just said 'thank you' and walked away.''
It took a few minutes for the horror of the announcement to sink in.
If any confirmation were required, it came in the form of shop stewards
hurrying from a separate briefing from management. ''I knew then that it
was the end,'' Peter says. ''The feeling on the shopfloor was that there
was no tomorrow. That was it.
When Peter got home that night, he told his wife at the door: ''You
were right this morning, Jean. It's us.'' There was no more to be said.
He spent the evening in front of the TV, unaware of what he was
watching. ''I was numb. If I had any feeling, it was that I had been
betrayed; that I had done all I could for the company and now it was
kicking me out. We all felt badly let down.''
After the initial shock, the mood in the warehouses hardened. ''The
anger is there to be seen, but there is also determination to try and
persuade the company they've made the wrong move,'' Peter says.
''There are 108 people on the shopfloor. I know every one, and there's
not an ounce of resignation in any of them. There are enhanced severance
terms on the table, but nobody wants to know. We want to keep our jobs.
We're ready to stand up and keep this factory alive.''
Over the years, RR had instilled a sense of pride and commitment in
its workforce, and ironically it is this very team spirit which has been
roused against the company in a last-ditch fight to avoid the dole.
Peter explains: ''There is strong self-belief at the plant. I'm not
going to slag off Derby, but when it comes to designing and building
aero-engines we're second to none. From the drawing board to the flight
tests, we're the best. It's not just commitment to a job, it's pride in
what we do. If we've got to go out, we'll go out with heads held high.
But hopefully it won't come to that.''
The chances are, of course, that it will; that in a few months more
than 600 men and women will be searching desperately for alternative
employment in an area with little to offer; a little army of people
suddenly anxious about paying mortgages, supporting elderly relatives,
and educating children. The cost in corporate terms of
''rationalisation'' is easily calculated; the cost in human angst far
harder to measure.
For Peter and Jean, it may mean scraping by on her wages for part-time
work testing components at the Motorola factory. After paying the
mortgage, there is barely enough left to feed and clothe the family, and
none for luxuries.''With 600 people hitting the dole, and without a
recognised skill, it's going to be hard for me to get another job,''
says Peter. ''So it's down to the bare essentials for us.''
They have already scrapped plans to take the children to Disneyland in
Florida this year, but amid all the gloom at least Peter retains his
sense of humour. Asked if they would manage a holiday this year, he
replies: ''Aye, if we can find a roofless caravan in Saltcoats.''
But he also has an understanding of the broader issues involved. He
says: ''I think Rolls-Royce is imploding into itself by centralising too
much. It's part of a process of the whole British aerospace industry
selling out, and some day all the engines will be made overseas. It's
the economics of the madhouse. Meantime there are going to be some
families here left with no earned income whatsoever. I don't think they
realise what they've done.
0 ''We want to keep our jobs not just for ourselves, but for East
Kilbide and the youngsters who'll be leaving school in the next few
years. The town's skill factor is being taken away in one fell swoop,
and these jobs are not going to be replaced. We're not making anything
any more. If we don't make anything, how can we survive?''

A COUPLE who both suffer from multiple sclerosis pleaded yesterday for
supplies of the drug Interferon Beta to be made available in Scotland.
Mr Angus Morrison fears that the drug may reach the NHS too late to
enable him to go on caring for his dying wife Catherine.
Mrs Morrison, a former neonatal care nurse at Yorkhill Hospital in
Glasgow, contracted MS 25 years ago; Mr Morrison was diagnosed 10 years
ago as having it.
The early symptoms of exhaustion are now taking their toll on Mr
Morrison as he struggles to nurse his paralysed wife in their cottage on
the shores of Loch Fyne in Argyllshire.
The 54-year-old couple have had their hopes raised by recent
favourable trial results of Interferon Beta, hailed in the British
Medical Journal last week as giving grounds for cautious optimism.
Neither variant of the drug -- 1A or 1B -- is a cure for MS but the
trials indicate that they can slow the progress of the disease, an
auto-immune disorder in which the myelin sheathing is stripped from
round the nerves, leading to scarring and loss of function.
According to an Edinburgh-based charity, the Myelin Project,
Interferon Beta is already being widely prescribed on a named-patient
basis in England.
Ms Diana McGovern, 51, founder of the Myelin Project and an MS
sufferer herself, is one of the few patients in Scotland who has been
able to get regular supplies.
''I have been taking it for eleven months,'' she said. ''It doesn't
turn the clock back so it is difficult to say what difference it has
made -- but it is what we might become that frightens us.
''The data we have seen are very favourable but doctors in Scotland
seem to be more cautious about giving it to individual patients before
it is approved for general use.''
One of the makers, Schering Health Care, hopes to have approval from
the European Licensing Authorities for their product -- Interferon Beta
1B -- around the summer of this year.
However, Mr Morrison, who used to work at the ARMS Hyperbaric
Treatment Centre for MS patients in Maryhill, Glasgow, until the disease
forced him to quit, is afraid time is running out for himself and
Catherine. He said: ''It would be a dream if the drug could be obtained
on the NHS but it seems to be an impossibility in Scotland.
''Catherine can't move her arms or legs, and her sight is very poor.
She is so dependent on me. We get nursing help three mornings a week
but, apart from that, I do everything.
''I am starting to get weakness in my left leg and left arm . . . for
a while I could not sign a cheque. Now I have to watch when I lift a
plate in case I dropped it.''
The Morrisons' cottage has been fitted out to make it as easy as
possible for him to lift Catherine about. She has a Possum computer
which enables her to open doors, switch lights on and off, and look
after the house for long enough to let Angus pop out for the messages.
He is proud of the fact that, after nine years' quadraplegia, she has
no bedsores -- and he wonders how long this can last if nothing can be
done to slow the progress of his own disease.

STARTING today, a selection of buy, sell and hold share
recommendations from leading stockbrokers will be published weekly.
Scottish stockbrokers cater extensively for the private investor, as
do a number of firms south of the Border. But stock market analysts at
the larger securities houses in the City address a wider, mostly
institutional shareholder clientele.
Their recommendations on individual shares are nonetheless valuable to
private investors, who are unlikely to have ready access to them.
Analysts have the resources to investigate industries and particular
companies in depth.
Each analyst usually specialises in a particular sector and gets to
know it in detail. He often visits the companies in his sector and is in
a strong position to assess prospects in the long and short term --
though, of course, he does not always get it right.
The aim of this column is to provide a good cross-section of analysts'
views from City as well as Scottish stockbrokers.
The opinions expressed are those of the stockbrokers making the
recommendations, with which the Herald does not necessarily agree.
British
Telecom
BUY at 399p (now 393p), recommends Goldman Sachs, which picks it as
one of five UK stocks in its European priority list. One of the least
expensive telecommunications companies in the world on a relative and
absolute basis. BT's March 1996 estimated price earning ratio of 12.2 is
at a slight discount to the UK market, compared with a market multiple
for most other telecom companies showing a slight premium relative to
their home markets. Underlying operating results continue to benefit
from improving economic conditions in the UK as well as the company's
increasingly competitive actions. BT is well-positioned to take
advantage of opportunities associated with the liberalisation of the
European telecom industry.
Tarmac
A RECOVERY buy at 115p, suggests Albert E Sharp. One of the UK's
largest housebuilders, Tarmac fell twice as fast as a lacklustre
building materials sector during 1994. January saw it fall further to a
two-year low of 107p but has since rallied as investors began to
appreciate the solid value increasingly apparent in the shares.
Short-term sentiment on housing is likely to continue to be adverse
through much of the first quarter. But, thereafter, housing activity,
and therefore sentiment, should progressively improve and with it the
Tarmac share price.
TDG
A FUNDAMENTAL reassessment is due after 25 years of underperformance
which has seen the distribution, transport and storage company's shares
fall in value by two-thirds relative to the market, says BZW. The
reconstruction of the business is now effectively complete and the task
now is to produce the right sort of returns. Profits are forecast to
improve this year from #26.9m to #34.5m and the yield at 200p on the
likely maintained dividend is 5.9%.
Sidlaw
THE brave will buy for income only at 158p (now 146p). Significant
capital gain may be some way off, says Bell Lawrie White. The annual
statement was a major disappointment and the particular comment that
''the packaging division's first-half performance will be significantly
below that reported for the same period last year'' indicates the extent
of the hole which Sidlaw has dug for itself. In packaging, Sidlaw has
not the brand names, market shares or customer relationships enjoyed by
others, so margins are suffering.
The broker is reducing its full-year pre-tax profit estimate from
#17.8m to #14m as well as there being a probable #1.5m exceptional loss.
However, the dividend could be raised 0.2p to 11.2p for a 9.6% yield.
Kingfisher
ATTENTION continues to be focused on Kingfisher, the retail chain
whose trading formats include B&amp;Q and the troubled Comet electricals
chain following the recent abrupt departure of chief executive Alan
Smith and finance director James Kerr-Muir.
Stockbroker BZW recommends holding the shares on the basis that the
longer fundamental underperformance continues the more vulnerable the
group will become. Accordingly, one should expect Kingfisher to be
valued increasingly in line with its underlying break-up value. BZW
estimates this to range from #4.70 to #6.00 per share. This compares
with Kingfisher's price in the market of 433p.
BSkyB
GOLDMAN Sachs, the US securities house, likes the look of British Sky
Broadcasting (BSkyB). It is the leading Pay-TV broadcasting service in
the UK with over 2.9 million satellite subscribers and close to one
million cable TV subscribers. Last week, the company pleased the City
with interim results showing a 48% increase in turnover to #356.9m.
The Goldman media analyst has a price target of 310p within nine
months, ie a rise of over 10%. The company is thought to be in a very
strong position for the future, with its long-term programme contracts,
encryption technology and subscriber management centre. BSKyB shares are
currently around 268p.
British
Airways
BRITISH Airways shares are set to climb higher from the current 384p,
according to Nikko Europe, though some turbulence may be encountered
until the situation at USAir, the American airline in which BA has
invested $400m, is formally clarified. Nikko says the benefits of the
alliance, amounting to some $100m, should continue even if USAir falls
into the Chapter 11 procedure which gives companies protection against
creditors. In the first nine months of 1994-95, BA's passenger traffic
rose by 7% against a 5% increase in capacity, resulting in an
improvement in load factor from 71% to 72.4%. Passenger yields dipped
0.2% but unit costs rose only 0.4%, which impressed Nikko's analyst.
Reckitt
&amp; Colman
RECKITT &amp; Colman wins a buy accolade from BZW, which believes the
shares will soon outperform as the market anticipates accelerating
earnings growth in 1996. Similar shares in the US have recently enjoyed
a substantial re-rating and Reckitt is expected to follow suit as
investment interest shifts increasingly towards consumer stocks. The
shares, currently 646p, already up 41p since the recommendation was
issued, have underperformed the market by 31% in the past three years,
leaving them on an historically depressed rating. BZW sees Reckitt's
markets becoming easier and profits benefiting from a new focused
strategy. Dividend growth should approach 10% a year between 1994 and
1997, with earnings forecast to rise 15% in 1996 and 13% in 1997.

Celtic 2, Hibernian 2
CELTIC'S Dutch striker, Pierre van Hooydonk, demonstrated at the
weekend that he can manoeuvre just as smartly off the field as he does
on it.
Producing a neat reverse turn, he brought a new dimension to
after-match chat when he interviewed the press. The troops were a bit
taken aback. Pierre, WE ask the questions.
The Dutchman, like most of his countrymen, is a deep thinker about the
game and was concerned to discover if Celtic had changed in the time
since he joined the club. ''You saw them before I came. Is it any
better?'' The answer has to be in the affirmative, but no-one gave him
the impression his new team had reached a new plane yet.
The tall man who played for Breda is clearly anxious to make an
impression, but is even more interested in seeing the Parkhead team
establishing a style that suits his own way of playing. For van
Hooydonk, the problem his height presents is a presumption that he is an
aerial player, a kind of Dutch Mark Hateley.
''Do you see a difference in the way we are playing now?'' he asked.
''I thought we played the best football since I came here. At first the
team sent long balls into me, but my best quality is on the ground. I
think now we are playing more one-twos, more football.''
Van Hooydonk, brought up to play the thinking man's game in the Dutch
style, was frustrated in the second half when his team, leading 2-1,
continued to push for a third goal.
''In Holland, if we are 2-1 up we keep the ball, we go backward if
there is no-one to play the ball ahead to, but Celtic go forward, and
then go forward again and again. All it needs a is a half chance and it
is 2-2, which is what happened.
''I like to play the Dutch way, but maybe I need to change my ways.
The only right way is the winning way.''
Hooydonk has a soul-mate in John Collins, who plays the game as he
likes it and thinks on the same wavelength, but the Dutchman is also
impressed by the young players coming into the big team.
His own ambitions lie in getting Celtic into Europe. ''I could have
played 100 years with Breda and not played in Europe. With Celtic I hope
to get there soon. We still have chances this season, in the Scottish
Cup and the league.''
Hooydonk, having held his own chat show with the pencil brigade, then
held court with a gaudily bedecked group of Breda fans who had made the
journey to see their old favourite in action. He had a busy day.
His contribution on the field was considerable in a game which was
dominated by a man who has been around the Scottish scene a great deal
longer. Jim Leighton, the Hibs goalie, pulled of a handful of wonderful
saves, but nothing he did was better than the attempt at halting
Collins' opening goal.
Hooydonk had taken a tremendous pass from Peter Grant and then laid on
a perfect ball for Collins, who hit it firmly and accurately for the
net. Leighton's diving touch deserved a better fate than the ball going
in off the post.
Collins had his best game for some time, but the outstanding Celtic
man yet again was defender Brian O'Neil, even if he and Mark McNally
found young Kevin Harper's incisive pace difficult to contain at times.
The 18-year-old might well have had a memorable day if he had
converted two golden opportunities but, while manager Alex Miller was
disappointed at those misses, he made the reasonable point that the
teenager was bound to make this kind of error as he goes through the
learning process. ''I think the main point about him is that he did not
look out of place and caused Celtic plenty of problems.''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns, who brought in Brian McLaughlin in
preference to team captain Paul McStay, was full of praise for the
Parkhead fans. ''I thought the supporters showed patience when they saw
the team trying to play football.''
If any player had a special point to make it was Hibs' Pat McGinlay,
who was transferred back to Hibs by Burns. The midfield man got his
message across with a fine day's work, including a well-taken goal that
levelled the scores after Collins' opener.
Willie Falconer did the next trick for Celtic, when he headed in the
second goal from a Collins cross, but the man who got most enjoyment out
of scoring had yet to make his appearance.
Mark McGraw, who replaced Joe Tortolano, scored a goal that meant much
more to him than any of the others, however satisfying it might have
been for them. The son of Morton manager Allan, McGraw was scoring only
his second goal of the season and needed it to further his claim for a
first-team place.
''The club has the best set of strikers on the staff since I came here
and it makes it very comeptitive. I am just glad to get a chance,'' he
said. ''It is important that I take any goal opportunities that come my
way.''
His previous goal, against Partick Thistle, also came when he was a
substitute. ''I had one touch before I scored that day, this time I had
two, and gave the ball away each time.''
McGraw's contract ends this summer and he knows he has to make the
most of any opportunities either to be given a new one or to attract
interest from elsewhere.

EXPRO International Group, a leading independent supplier of oilfield
services, is to be floated this spring with an expected market
capitalisation of over #100m.
The company, which in July 1992 was the subject of a #52m management
buyout from Flextech, was originally formed in 1973 with venture capital
backing and established operating bases in Great Yarmouth, to service
the gas fields in the southern North Sea, and in Aberdeen to provide
services to the North Sea oilfields.
In the North Sea, the group has built strong positions in a number of
its niche markets and has expanded its franchise into other oil and gas
producing areas in Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa, South
America, the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, certain of which
have only recently become accessible to Western operators and service
companies.
The board, led by group chief executive John Dawson, now want to raise
finance to reduce debt and fund expansion.
For the nine months to end December 1994, 47% of turnover was derived
from the UK continental shelf with the remaining 53% coming from
overseas markets.
Around two thirds of revenues currently come from the development and
production phases of the upstream oil and gas industry which provide a
more stable and long term source of revenues than exploration and
appraisal activities. Some 20% of the group's turnover is at present
related to gas exploration and production.
Group products and services are provided to most of the major Western
oil companies.
Since the buyout, which was backed by CINVen, profits have risen from
#7.8m in 1992/93 to #10.4m on turnover of #65.4m in 1993/94. Further
''significant growth'' in profits is forecast for the current financial
year. The flotation will be sponsored by Robert Fleming &amp; Company and
Cazenove &amp; Co will be brokers to the issue.

EUROTUNNEL is still targeting a half share of the cross-channel car
market despite a new report which considers claims that it could reach
only a quarter and face ''commercial collapse.''
The report, from a study group including Kent County Council, ferry
companies and Eurotunnel itself, is based on work by consultants MDS
Transmodal.
The report suggests that ''using objective assumptions'', the
consultants' projections are ''much less optimistic about the prospects
for the tunnel''.
The report considers various assumptions about future tunnel market
share, from Eurotunnel's 50% to 35% or even 25% suggested by ferry
companies, which would imply ''the commercial collapse of Eurotunnel''.
But Eurotunnel spokesman John Noulton said: ''We would hardly be
producing a report which forecasts our possible collapse. This document
is not a forecast of cross-channel traffic share.
''It recognises that the cross-channel market share of the Kent ports
including Eurotunnel is growing rapidly and will continue to grow. It
produces a strategy designed to help achieve that.''
The report called for better infrastructure -- including the planned
high-speed rail line and new road links -- and backed this with
projections based on conflicting assumptions supplied by the rival
operators, he said.
''Eurotunnel happily signed up to this report which certainly does not
forecast that we will achieve 25% or 35% of the market. Our own forecast
remains that we will achieve 50% of the car market.
This was in addition to predicting that it would make ''a substantial
hole'' in the freight market -- and did not take account of through
passengers travelling by Eurostar trains, said Mr Noulton.
A spokesman for P&amp;O European Ferries confirmed the projections were
supplied by the operators. It had long held the view that the tunnel
would reach 35% of the market.

SCOTLAND reported no casualties from their squad session at
Murrayfield yesterday as the squad prepared for the Five Nations' trip
to Paris on Saturday, where they will endeavour to log their first away
win over France since 1969.
The London Scottish replacement prop Paul Burnell did not attend the
session as he is suffering from tonsillitis but, say the management, he
is expected to be fit and well by the weekend.
According to an SRU spokesman, there were no further adverse reports
on captain Gavin Hastings (back) who played no part in Watsonians'
league win over Heriot's FP on Saturday or Stirling County winger Ken
Logan (ankle) who was absent from his side's outing against
Stewart's-Melville FP.

DAVID Sole, Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam captain, declared yesterday
that if the weekend revelations that French clubs are paying win bonuses
to their players proved to be correct then, logically, the Scots should
refuse to play France in Paris on Saturday.
Sole, who raised the issue of professionalism within the French game
three years ago in his autobiography, said that Saturday's international
would, of course, go ahead but he hoped that the authorities would now
look seriously at worldwide abuses of the amateurism regulations.
The apparent admission by the president of the French rugby champions
Toulouse that their players are paid bonuses for a win comes in a BBC
Scotland documentary to be screened later this week.
The revelation, and the associated suspicion that the practice is
widespread throughout the French game, could not have come at a more
inopportune time for Scotland during the week of the Paris match and for
the International Board which is in the final stages of its own
investigation into professionalism.
Toulouse president Rene Bouscatel makes the cash revelations in a BBC
Scotland ''Frontline'' documentary -- For Love and Money? -- to be
screened on Thursday night.
Bouscatel is understood to say: ''Here we have a fixed monthly amount
which covers all the time the players lose through rugby training and
loss of earnings.''
He apparently adds: ''There is also a match bonus based on results.
That is a reward if they win, for what they've brought to the club and
for the pleasure they've brought to the sponsors and spectators. No one
here earns more than 110 francs a year. (#13,750)''
The admission by Bouscatel, if correct, is in direct and blatant
contravention of International Board regulations, which state: ''The
game is an amateur game. No person is allowed directly or indirectly to
receive payment, benefit or other material reward ... for taking part in
the game.''
It has been suspected for many years that the highly competitive and
heavily sponsored French club game is bolstered by player payments.
Between 1932 and the end of World War II, Scotland broke off playing
relations with France over financial irregularities.
The Scots are due to travel to Paris on Saturday for their Five
Nations' encounter with France, who include two Stade Toulousain players
in the side to meet Scotland.
In his autobiography -- ''Heart and Sole'' -- David Sole maintained
that the system of payments in France was borrowed directly from rugby
league, where players are on substantial win bonuses. He argued for a
''level playing field'' throughout the world so that all international
players were placed on the same financial footing.
Yesterday he said: ''It's been common knowledge among players that
this has been going on for years. The authorities, though, have chosen
to adopt an ostrich-like attitude with their heads in the sand.
''What is surprising is that here we, apparently, have a French
official coming out into the open and admitting the practice. The
logical effect of this would be that Scotland would refuse to play
France but that won't happen. Perehaps now, though, the blatant
shamateurism that goes on all around the world will be addressed,'' said
Sole who now manages Scotland's under-19 side.
Yesterday, Scotland's two IB representatives, Freddie McLeod and Alan
Hosie, were attending a meeting in London and were unavailable for
comment.
An IB investigation into professionalism within the game worldwide is
due to be presented to the board agm in Bristol next month. The inquiry
team, headed by board chairman Vernon Pugh QC of Wales, and comprising
Freddie McLeod, Rob Fisher of New Zealand, and Bernard Lapasset of
France has, as reported in The Herald a fortnight ago, already
undercovered widespread abuses of the game's amateurism regulations.

Moscow, Sunday
REBEL Chechnya said today its forces killed 250 Russian troops by
blowing up a booby-trapped missile site as they stepped up hit-and-run
attacks in flashpoints outside the capital Grozny.
Chechen Information Minister Movladi Udugov told Ekho Moskvy radio
station the Russians were killed when withdrawing Chechen forces blew up
the mined former Soviet missile launching site near the town of
Alkhan-Kala, southwest of Grozny.
Udugov said 24 Russian armoured vehicles had also been destroyed at
the site.
''The entire compound was blown up -- it had been mined . . . All the
equipment and soldiers who entered the compound were completely
destroyed by fire,'' he told Ekho Moskvy.
The report could not be confirmed, but lightly-armed Chechens have
inflicted heavy casualties on Russian troops who have been humiliated at
many stages in eight weeks of fighting.
Reuters television pictures shot this week at a military morgue in the
city of Rostov-on-Don showed numerous corpses recovered from
battlefields, some naked and decomposing on stretchers, others in red
coffins bearing the Russian flag.
Udugov reported a sniper war in central Grozny and fighting around the
key southern junction at Minutka Square, belying Russian claims that
fighting had eased over the weekend.
The Russian government's press office said there had been no active
military operations in the remote mountainous region yesterday or today
and that Russians controlled most of Grozny.
But Udugov reported Russian air raids and artillery shelling on the
towns of Alkhan-Yurt and Alkhan-Kala, a few miles out of Grozny on the
main road southwest.
He said battles were fought today at Argun, a town nine miles east of
Grozny which media reports have suggested is the new rebel headquarters.
The Chechen minister said Russian forces were trying to break through
Chechen defences outside Gudermes, Chechnya's second biggest city about
25 miles east of Grozny.--Reuter.

THERE are some moments -- just a few, and they are to be savoured --
when the Royal SNO plays like no other orchestra in the world.
Usually those moments are in Russian music, and they usually occur
when the band is with a good East European conductor.
It's nothing to do with polish, ensemble, virtuosity, or any of the
characteristics with which one normally associates high-quality
orchestral playing. It's as though something elemental is unleashed in
the collective psyche of the orchestra. It's awesome when it happens, as
it did on Saturday night when principal guest conductor Alexander
Lazarev directed a performance of Prokofiev's Third Symphony that was
almost primal in its ferocity.
The key to what happens is that such a conductor gives the band its
head -- did those winds ever shriek more chillingly, the brass blaze
more aggressively? And in interpretation of the symphony, Lazarev seized
on the fact that at key points Prokofiev hurls diametrically opposing
types of music together -- broad, searing melodies and the driving,
machine-like rhythms of the factory.
Slamming the two together almost causes a short-circuit in the brain.
The effect was astonishing; mind-numbing, edge-of-the-seat stuff, with
the SNO playing out of its skin, tearing apart the piece like a
voracious predator with a hunk of raw meat between its jaws.
The first half of the concert was another extreme -- sheer
sophistication in Gounod's ballet music from Faust, and the inimitably
suave, highly polished oboe playing of Douglas Boyd in a mellow and
immaculately phrased account of Richard Strauss's autumnal Oboe
Concerto. Good turnout.

HOW ironic that the first production to open at the Brunton Theatre
after the announcement of the Scottish Arts Council's grant withdrawal
for the next financial year should not only be a new play -- the SAC
professes to encourage the work of contemporary playwrights -- but also
one with a cast of 10. With a company that size it wouldn't have taken
too extravagant a director to blow the current year's #53,000 grant on
this one show alone.
Perhaps it's coincidence, but there also seems to be an air of bolshie
defiance about Robin Peoples' production of this historical drama by
Raymond Ross. With a recurring clatter of drums and an invariable dark
and gloomy lighting plan, the play seethes and rages like a mean and
moody caged beast that won't be told to lie down.
Despite the rigours of a dense and demanding script, the actors are
uniformly unshakable, blasting out Ross's old Scots language with
relentless vigour on a stripped back Shakespearean stage.
Why then does it add up to such a tedious evening? It's partly that
with so much anger ladled out from start to finish it's very difficult
to focus on the finer points of the plot which is all about the
political machinations and institutionalised misogyny that allowed James
VI to introduce witch hunts to Scotland.
There's also not a sympathetic character in it -- James VI himself is
sickly, ineffectual and, like everyone else, bad tempered -- and so many
scenes of wordy negotiations quickly become wearing, especially when you
get the sense that the real action is happening elsewhere. Some humour
would be nice, but anything to alleviate the overbearing tone of
disgruntlement would be welcome.

Johannesburg, Sunday
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela failed today to persuade 11 ANC
members not to resign from the executive of the party's Women's League
headed by his estranged wife Winnie.
He stepped in to try to resolve the controversy, holding four hours of
talks with the 11 women who announced their decision to quit yesterday,
citing bad leadership, undemocratic practices and unaccountability in
the organisation.
''We will not change our minds about the resignations,'' said Nosiviwe
Mpisa-Nqakula who had been secretary-general of the African National
Congress Women's League (ANCWL).
''We want the ANC to resolve the problems of the Women's League,'' she
told a news conference after meeting President Mandela.
The president said: ''This is a matter that is entirely in the hands
of the women's league. They are in firm control.'' He declined further
comment.
Mpisa-Nqakula said the president had promised to arrange a meeting of
the Women's League executive, which had 25 members before yesterday's
resignations, and the ANC proper.
''He is seriously considering to put structures in place to finally
resolve the problems in the ANC Women's League. We have finally got the
African National Congress to intervene in the problems,'' she added.
Also in the 11-strong group were Adelaide Tambo, widow of ANC
president Oliver Tambo who died in 1993, and South African Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma.
The meeting came after reports of a new controversy over Mrs Mandela's
criticism of her husband's government.
Johannesburg's Sunday Times said South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki had given her an ultimatum on Friday to retract critical
statements or resign as deputy minister of arts and culture.
She had criticised the government at a funeral last week, saying it
had failed South Africans by not dealing with apartheid imbalances and
removing racism.
President Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, was unable to comment
on the reports of an ultimatum.
''He was unhappy about certain remarks. The deputy president and the
president are dealing with the matter. They will probably issue a
statement early next week,'' Mankahlana said.
President Mandela had summoned all ANC cabinet ministers and deputy
ministers to Pretoria last Thursday to discuss Mrs Mandela's comments,
the Sunday Times said.
None of the 11 disaffected ANCWL leaders identified Mrs Mandela among
their reasons for leaving.
Tambo said that she had resigned over a joint tourism venture between
the league and actor Omar Sharif, launched last Thursday by Mrs Mandela
without consulting the organisation.
Mrs Mandela was unavailable for comment today.
The league has considerable influence in the ANC, which swept to power
in all-race elections in April last year.
Mrs Mandela was elected ANCWL president in May 1993 in a dramatic
comeback after she resigned all political posts when she was sentenced
to five years' jail in 1991 on kidnapping charges. On appeal, her
sentence was reduced to a fine of 15,000 rand (#2700).
Until her trial many had considered her the ''mother of the nation''
while her husband served 27 years in prison.
Last week the Canadian government refused her an entry visa because of
her criminal background.--Reuter.

ARE you thinking of setting up in business? Or do you perhaps already
have a small business and need advice about expansion or development?
Trying to get advice and information about the different types and
sources of assistance available can be time consuming and frustrating.
Tomorrow sees the start of a series of enterprise roadshows in Glasgow
bringing together a wide range of different organisations which can help
existing businesses and business start ups. The roadshows give visitors
the opportunity to see for themselves what is on offer from the various
agencies in an informal exhibition-style atmosphere. Admission and all
advice at the roadshows is free.
There is no pressure put on visitors by the participating agencies.
They can browse around and pick up leaflets. They can stop to talk with
representatives of the agencies taking part and can arrange follow-up
meetings with them. No agreements are reached nor obligations incurred
at the roadshows themselves.
This is the eleventh series of enterprise roadshows organised by
Glasgow Opportunities on behalf of the participating agencies. GO is the
local enterprise trust for Glasgow. Jean Baillie, GO's manager of
business training services, said: ''This is the one time in the year
that all the major business advisory agencies are brought together in
one place, and so it is a unique opportunity for anyone considering
self-employment or developing their business.
''It's certainly much easier than having to ring round different
agencies for information and then having to make appointments to see
them. Here they are all together in one place so that people can get an
overall picture of what assistance might be available and from where.
The local enterprise initiative will also be there to advise people
about the opportunities and assistance available in specific areas of
Glasgow.
''For many people the roadshow is their first point of contact with
these agencies. For others it is the opportunity to see them all in one
day which otherwise might take weeks or even months to get round.
Everyone who attends is taken seriously and often follow-up appointments
are made.''
The roadshows will be of interest both to start ups and existing
businesses. Ms Baillie said: ''It does not matter how far or how little
advanced the business idea is. Some people may not even have a firm feel
yet of what they want to do. Others may have very definite plans but
need advice on their commercial feasibility or how to present them or
get financial assistance. They will all get something out of the
roadshows.''
The range of organisations taking part means that advice and
information is available to visitors about finance for start up or
expansion, training either for themselves or for their staff, finding
new or additional premises, marketing, taking on staff, and indeed on
any matter likely to be important to people setting up in or developing
a business.
Attendance at the enterprise roadshows has been rising over the years.
Last year about 500 were expected but in fact there were about 700
visitors. This year's turnout is expected to well exceed last year.
Visitors come from all age groups and backgrounds. Some are young people
who see self employment as an opportunity to develop skills and
experience for future career prospects. Some are in jobs which have
given them skills they feel they could use to set up in a business of
their own.
Others are people who have been made redundant but who have skills and
experience they can use to set up a successful business, and some are
women who have taken time off paid work because of family commitments
and who feel their skills and expertise could best be used in self
employment. Many, whatever their current work circumstances visit the
enterprise roadshows because they are committed to a business idea which
they are sure could succeed. A growing number are people who own or run
existing businesses but need advice about expansion or development. All
are welcome.
Tomorrow's enterprise roadshow is being held in the Ingram Hotel, from
noon until 8pm and the following day in the Swallow Hotel from 5pm until
9pm. Next week there will be a further three roadshows, on Monday at
Partick Thistle, on Tuesday at the Grosvenor Hotel and on Wednesday at
Celtic Park.

THE value of the enterprise roadshows is the range of agencies taking
part so that visitors can tap into the services they offer according to
their own personal business needs.
This year for the first time the Industry Department of the Scottish
Office has come on board, further broadening and strengthening the range
of advice and assistance on offer.
Located in Glasgow and Edinburgh it advises the Scottish Secretary of
State on industrial and economic development in Scotland. Its Glasgow
office is responsible for administering a range of Government and
European Community funded programmes, financial assistance schemes and
expert advice designed to stimulate business growth.
The Scottish Business Shop is also taking part. In partnership with
over 100 public organisations including local enterprise companies,
local authorities, chambers of commerce, local enterprise agencies and
development companies, the Scottish Business Shop network provides
independent and confidential advice on all areas for business start up
and development. Quality and consistency of the network's services are
overseen by Enterprise Services Scotland, a subsidiary of Scottish
Enterprise.
Strathclyde Business Development can provide grants for taking on
unemployed people or for training young people. There are also grants
for training in management and new technology and for unemployed people
starting up in business, with special grant provision for unemployed
women.
Loans of up to 50% can be available in some circumstances. Help can
also be given in seed capital funding. It has a comprehensive database
of industrial and commercial property available within the region and
can advise on current property market rates. It holds databases on
business opportunities and business information and can advise on a wide
range of business services.
Also taking part is the Glasgow Development Agency which can provide
specialist assistance in trade and export development, investment, the
Investors in People award BS5750, technology and design, and company
developments. The agency invests substantially in enterprise trusts and
local area initiatives which provide the main support and advisory
centres for people setting up in business and for small businesses in
their formative years. Glasgow North, East End Partnership, Greater
Easterhouse Development Agency and Govan Initiative are all taking part
in the roadshow.
The business development office of Glasgow City Council Industrial
Development Unit provides a free service for local businesses and
business start ups including advice on marketing, selling, production
control, financial management and business plans for retailing,
wholesaling and manufacturing. The unit operates a number of small
funding schemes.
The Scottish Co-operative Development Company was set up to help
worker co-operatives and other types of employee owned business start
ups and also to provide them with ongoing assistance afterwards. This
includes training in business practices, help in developing business
ideas and business plans, help in registering the company and an
aftercare service covering all aspects of business, training and
development.

THE city of Dundee, on the estuary of the River Tay, has had a history
as tumultuous as the giant swells that sweep up the narrow channel from
the North Sea. It went from being one of the most prosperous medieval
burghs to the most industrialised city of nineteenth-century Scotland.
One of the newest attractions in Dundee is Discovery Point, next to
Discovery herself, the first ship designed for research and development
and built in Dundee. At one time Dundee was second only to the Clyde for
shipbuilding.
Clustered around Dundee are the Tay Country Parks, of Clatto and,
further out, Crombie and Monike. They have extensive play facilities for
children and plenty of wide open spaces for quiet enjoyment.
Traces of all Scotland's history can be found in the other great city
of the Tay, Perth. Watergate was once the home of the nobility of
medieval Perth, and North Inch was scene of the Battle of the Clans in
the thirteenth century. The Inch is skirted by the lovely Georgian Rose
Terrace.
Perth Civic trust has helped to ensure that modern Perth is a good
place in which to live. There is an attractive pedestrianised shopping
centre and walkways by the side of the river. The North and South
Inches, public playgrounds are ablaze with flowers in spring and summer.
Boating, boules, football and cricket are activities you can enjoy.
Famous castles can be a bit daunting, but Scone Palace where once the
kings of Scotland were crowned is different. It is crammed full of
interest while being easy to appreciate. European seventeenth-century
carved ivories are treasures among a notable collection of furniture and
china.
If the thought of all these activities tires you, take a stroll in a
gentle place, Bell's Cherrybank Gardens, where there are more than 700
species of heather in the National Heather Collection.
From Perth take the A9 road to Inverness. There seems to be a beauty
spot around every corner.
The road, however, has a bad reputation and try to avoid rush hours
and watch the frequent changes from single to dual carriageway.
Turn right at Dunkeld, the start of Highland Perthshire. The
cathedral, begun in l570 was destroyed during the Reformation, but the
former choir has been restored for use as the Parish Church. The Chapter
House museum houses a history of the church in Dunkeld. A woodland walks
goes to the Tay and Telford's Bridge.
Connected to Dunkeld by the bridge is Birnam, home of the Beatrix
Potter garden, based loosely on her works. As a child she spent summer
holidays in this area.
You may like to rejoin the A9 briefly before the A822 to Crieff and
Comrie. Stop at the beguiling hamlet of Amulree with its unusually
designed church housing an exhibition of the history of the area
including emigration to Canada.
Crieff has Scotland's oldest distillery, going back to at least 1775.
Guided tours take place throughout the day. Nearby is Stuart Crystal,
where you can watch the intricate art of glass engraving.
Further along the A9 is The Hermitage, 37 acres of mixed woodland cut
by the River Braan and its waterfalls. Red squirrels, grey wagtails and
other creatures are commonly seen. It is interesting at all times of the
year but has a magical appeal in the winter with snow on the trees.
The Tay river system, with its host of tributaries, is vast. The river
is the most powerful in Britain, with a flow greater than that of the
Thames and Severn combined. Together they make a region of rivers, and
provide sights of enormous power and beauty. The downside of this water
paradise is serious flooding, known to the people of Perthshire for
centuries.
Few sights delight visitors more than waterfalls great or small and
there are plenty of both. The Falls of Moness in the Birks of Aberfedly
are attractive enough to make the circular walk of 1[1/2] miles
worthwhile. Seats and viewpoints help you get your breath. The Birks
still have pockets of original wildwood, though the extensive
deforestation of the early eighteenth century led Samuel Johnson to
remark that ''a tree in Scotland is as rare as a horse in Venice''. By
the turn of the century landowners were planting again and the Birks are
now a rich and highly valued woodland habitat.
The higher of the Falls of Acharn, reached by a path on the south side
of Loch Tay is surrounded by a wooden walkway. The mountains and fast
flowing rivers and streams that give Scotland much of its natural
attraction also give it hydro electricity. The dams and reservoirs are
constructed and screened to cause as little interference with the
environment.
One of the best known is Pitlochry Dam and Visitor Centre. There are
explanations of how electricity is produced and a viewing chamber to
watch the salmon moving along the fish ladder, constructed to help them
reach their spawning grounds. The Garry-Tummel scheme in particular has
many pleasant walks, including one around the man-made Loch Faskally.
Loch Tay, a loch of many woods, is probably at its most impressive
with snow on the peaks of Ben Lawers nearby. The crannogs of Loch Tay,
islands in the loch which supported human life in prehistoric times have
been investigated, and a replica crannog will be on display this year,
with a more detailed exhibition to follow later. Ben Lawers,
Perthshire's highest mountain has a visitor centre, nature trail and a
stiff walk to the summit. It is noted for alpine flowers.
Pitlochry, a holiday town since Victorian times, is at the centre of a
network of interesting places to visit. Go north to Blair Castle, the
home of the only private army in Britain allowed to bear arms, the
Atholl Highlanders.
From Loch Rannoch and Rannoch Station take a train ride to Fort
William, through beautiful Highland scenery.
At Aberfeldy there is a footbridge over the Tay made of glass and
fibre reinforced plastic, the first of its kind in the world. The water
from The Birks is harnessed for the Aberfedly Water Mill, where you can
buy stone ground flour.
If you travel over Moulin Moor you will come to Moulin itself with its
church that is well over 1000 years old. Carry on to Blairgowrie and
follow the story of heraldry through the ages at the Keathbank Mill and
Heraldry Centre.
A few hundred years ago the people of Glenshee were afraid to travel
over the Cairnwell Pass alone. They were terrorised by Catarnas,
Highland outlaws from the West, with a penchant for murder and cattle
stealing. Now the journey is made routinely by skiers to ''Ski
Glenshee'' on slopes organised for beginners and experts. If skiing is
not to your liking, go straight on to Braemar and Royal Deeside.
The Tay is, of course, a major salmon river, and first-class fishing
for salmon and trout, and coarse fishing, is easy to find. A pamphlet,
once again available from tourist offices, gives advice and vital
information on regulations.
Hotels, and agents for the estates, will be able to put you in the
picture for game shooting and stalking.
Whether you seek peace, relaxation, interesting places to visit or
strenuous physical activity, you will find them all in the Land of the
Tay.

BIG Hamish is pleased. He's got tatties and they're selling for
anything up to 10 times what he's had to settle for in recent years. And
what about the straw? Don't tell Hamish farming is coming to a bad patch
as long as straw is through the roof.
You'll remember the sale he had at the back of harvest time? He had
several thousand bales for sale at his estate by the coast. Now, I've
been going to roups for a long time and I thought I always knew what was
going on.
I knew Hamish was having a hard time selling his straw but I thought
he was working away at about #5 a bale. I thought I had got one of the
few bargains when I got 100 bales of rape straw for #150.
But that was far from the truth. In fact, mine was the only bargain.
None of the rest of the straw was sold except to seagulls. I was
suspicious when the local lollipop man had 100 bails of barley straw
knocked down to him. I knew he had five rows of strawberries but that
did seem too much.
Anyway what seemed like a disaster in October is like winning the
lottery now. Hamish's luck started to turn before Christmas. He got an
order for rape straw and was delivering it on his old lorry trailer. He
manages to get them four high on that though he has to watch for low
bridges. When he was passing through Maud he noticed that the mart was
in action, selling store cattle.
Now, half of those stores were only being sold because the farmers
were short of straw, and all the buyers know that the price will take
off once the end of the winter comes in sight. In a flash Hamish saw his
opportunity. He persuaded the auctioneer to interrupt his sale to find a
home for ''56 bales of rape straw on the trailer ootside''. They made
twice what I had paid for mine and Hamish's straw strade was off.
Now he's at #10 for barley and wheat and a fiver for spring rape
straw.
Mossie's selling straw too, ammonia treated stuff. At least he would
if he wasn't so greedy. He wants #60 a tonne for it. ''Not too bad,''
you might think with straw at #10 and the treatment costing #16 a tonne
and wrapping a couple of pounds a bale.
But Mossie's bales are five-and-a-half footers, baled with a
high-compression bailer. He weighed a few of them and they are
half-a-tonne each. That's #30 a bale he's asking.
Well, I'm saying nothing but I've about a hundred bales spare. And to
think some of us used to harvest the stuff with a marchbox.
The fact that I had all that wealth in the cornyard meant I went off
to Perth on Wednesday with confidence as well as the usual ambition to
buy a replacement for poor old Argus. It's an important job because when
you buy your bull you are buying half your herd.
I swore to be scientific. I swore to be careful. And, now that the
Breadwinner is at home doing the books and therefore cannot be fooled, I
swore not to go far above my limit of #3000.
The first to catch my eye was the junior champion, a bull so large I
wondered if I would be able to feed him through to the grass even with
all that spare straw. And he was bigger even than I thought for I
presumed, and even moved on with the idea, that he was the senior
champion. But that was a bigger bull altogether.
He was just the sort the pedigree breeders like. He was long, tall and
bonnie. Unfortunately for the seller he also had some difficulty in
negotiating the small and sloping ring and certainly spoiled himself
with one top breeder because of that.
And the seller was doubly unfortunate because long, tall and bonnie
isn't what the commercial men are looking for. They want size all right
but they want it at the back and they want to see loads of muscle on the
frame.
I should have bought that bull for he only just got over my official
limit. But buying is a very psychological affair. You can get bidding
constipation. It looks like a bargain, and then it is chapped out to
someone else and your hands are still in your pockets.
But at least that opened me up. Soon I was bidding away trying to
snatch something below three thousand. I certainly succeeded, though I
am not very proud of the manner of it.
This decent enough looking bull from Norfolk stuck at 1200gns. I
mentioned to my neighbour that he had a fabulous 400 day weight. He said
''and he's got a topper of an EBV''. Now I know that that is a very
scientific measure of everything that's known about the bull and if
theories worked it would be all you need to know to buy a bull, but I'd
never come across one before.
So I bid and got half my herd for 1300gns
Now my neighbour was Alan Fotheringham, a leader of that most
scientific of breeds, the Limousins, so I presumed his advice was good.
But on my other flank was Keith Redpath who, as a dealer, can't afford
many mistakes.
He kindly informed me that the figure on which I had bought my new
herdsire was not the EBV but the certainty with which the predicted
result would occur. On the real EBV, he was able to show us, my bull was
no better than average.
But then neither was his price.

GLASGOW Opportunities is not only co-ordinating the Enterprise
Roadshows. Its staff will also be on hand to give information about its
own training and business counselling services, most of which are run in
partnership with other agencies.
GO is the local enterprise trust for Glasgow. Initially set up as a
partnership between industry and the public sector to help new and small
businesses in the Glasgow area. It has in the past 11 years developed
and extended its role to help businesses of all types and all sizes and
has become a centre of information about financial support and training
opportunities for companies and individuals, bringing in the resources
and expertise of established companies to help new and developing
businesses.
Over the years GO has developed its services to include loan funds,
training for owners and managers, innovation counselling, venture
capital introduction and general promotional activities to encourage and
help people become self employed. Its ability to attract finance from
the private sector and to direct financial support to clients in both
the private and public sectors make it a unique organisation. GO now has
more than 60 private sector sponsors.
Other sponsors include the Glasgow Development Agency, Glasgow City
Council and Strathclyde Regional Council, all of which are taking part
in the Enterprise Roadshows starting tomorrow.
GO offers business counselling, advice and support to people wanting
to start up in business or to develop an existing business, and all its
services are free of charge.
Executive director Agnes Samuel said: ''We try to identify and fill
gaps in the provision of business support services and training and not
to duplicate what other agencies are already doing. Our work complements
other schemes and initiatives in the Glasgow area.
''We have become increasingly successful at accessing European funds,
mainly from the European Regional Development Fund and the European
Social Fund, both of which are managed in this area by the Strathclyde
Integrated Development Organisation.''
Training is a vital part of GO's activities. For the past six years it
has been the city's leading provider of business skills seminars,
offering more than 12,000 places. GO has also developed advanced
seminars on marketing, finance and management.
In partnership with private and public organisations GO organises
programmes of enterprise seminars to serve as tasters for companies and
encourage them to take advantage of other services and facilities.
Its business and human resource development programme is designed to
equip senior personnel to use the company's resources to the full to
improve planning, training and development. This programme is supported
by Glasgow City Council and the European Social Fund.
Within its offices GO has a training suite which can be hired by
companies or other organisations. The suite has a large reception area,
two fully equipped training rooms, dining area and separate kitchen.
Buffet meals can be provided if required. Both training rooms have a
full range of visual and other aids.

IF ever there was an industry facing a PR crisis it is farming today.
Let us list, in no particular order, some of the problems a corporate
PR might be asked to tackle if he won the brief to promote the farmers'
case.
First, there is the widespread public concern over the export of young
calves for the Continental veal trade and the export of live animals in
general.
Second, the claim that those animals which are destined to be
slaughtered nearer home may be badly treated in the auction markets.
Then comes the public perception that the farmer is a subsidy junkie who
will undertake no activity which is not supported by a grant of some
description.
Finally, the argument that intensive farming methods, with heavy
dosages of chemicals, place the farmer in the role of polluter rather
than preserver of the countryside.
Farmers are not unaware of the fact that they have an image problem.
The difficulty is knowing what to do about it. Some favour the hiring of
men in shiny suits to produce equally shiny PR material to show that
everything in the garden is rosy.
Others are casting about for a farmer/communicator, who can put the
public right on some misconceptions. Captain Ben Coutts has been doing
his bit in that regard this week. Those who criticise the castration of
young lambs should realise that, otherwise, stock would deteriorate
through rampant incest, he points out.
''Do city folk ever think of the stress on canaries in cages -- or on
big dogs in small flats?'' he wonders.
It does appear that an anti-farmer bandwagon is gaining speed at a
remarkable rate. In November, at the Smithfield Show in London, the
veal-calf issue was already coming to the fore. The animal rights
protestors outside Earls Court were, at best, desultory in their
picketing.
Only about eight weeks later we had Shoreham and Brightlingsea and
then the invitable death of a protestor under the wheels of a lorry.
Suddenly the stakes had been upped.
This week's BBC Frontline Scotland programme could only add to the
farmers' problems. It showed animals being roughly handled on their way
to the sale ring in a way which most people would find unacceptable.
The markets, of course, come under the control of the auction
companies and in the worst instances they were able to claim that the
people shown striking animals were not market employees. Sadly, one was
said to be an owner.
While such emotive scenes may be claimed to be isolated instances they
are definitely bad PR for both the farming and market businesses. The
solution is relatively easy. There is a market code which, if adhered
to, would resolve the issue. There seems little point in having staff
trained in animal handling if blatant breaches of the code are going to
be tolerated.
For their own sakes farmers might have to consider boycotting markets
which they considered were doing them a disservice on the PR front.
Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, who filmed the scenes in
the markets, has set out his demands as being that animals should be
reared under humane conditions, go through a humane marketing system and
reach a quiet death in the slaughterhouse. For a vegetarian that is a
reasonable stance.
Livestock farmers are already aware of the threat posed by
vegetarianism and have expressed concern at the ''brainwashing'' of
schoolchildren exposed to publicity from the vegetarian lobby. The Meat
and Livestock Commission also produces information packs for schools so
it is difficult to argue that the other side of the story should not be
represented.
Our own Charlie Allan has indicated that if his grandchildren's school
class is to be to be subjected to vegetarian propaganda he will demand
the right of reply.
As one Ayrshire farmer pointed out the vegetarians can be equally
accused of interrupting a life cycle. Most vegetables are harvested for
eating at a point before they have flowered and gone to seed -- which
would be the natural course of events. It may even be that a cabbage
lets out a scream as it is cut from the stalk.
Finally, the really big issue may prove to be the idea that farmers
are hooked on subsidies which add substantially to our food and tax
bills. Treasury Minister Jonathan Aitken weighed in last week with a
claim that the CAP was costing the average British family #28 a week.
His arithmetic is suspect. The cost person is less than 88p a week, or
#3.50p for a family of four. To arrive at Mr Aitken's total you have to
make a whole range of assumptions about world prices and the likely
effects of withdrawing CAP support.
Nonetheless, the impression is abroad that farmers are becoming an
expensive item and the main PR thrust of the disparate agriculture
industry will have to be deployed in that direction.

Washington, Sunday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton opened a meeting of Israeli and Arab foreign
ministers meant to revitalise the faltering Middle East peace process
today saying the United States would ''redouble our efforts to get the
peace process back in full gear.''
The meeting, presided over by Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
brought together foreign ministers from Israel, Jordan and Egypt and a
top Palestine Liberation Organisation aide. The peace process has been
deadlocked by Israeli-PLO differences over Palestinian self-rule plans.
''It is no secret to anyone in the world that we are at a criticial
moment in the peace process. We cannot allow the rise of terror again to
threaten this peace,'' Clinton said at the start of the meeting at Blair
House, an official government guest house opposite the White House.
''We are prepared in this country to redouble our efforts to get the
peace process back in full gear. We are doing what we can on our own and
with others to deal with the problem of terror,'' he said.
He hoped the meeting here would establish specific steps the parties
could take to keep the peace process going.--Reuter.

A BOARD game for pregnant women which hopes to teach a serious message
has been invented by student nurses Aileen Sharkey and Sheila Girvan,
from Lochaber.
They devised the dice and counters game, called Breast Feeding and
costing #40, designed to be played with qualified staff in hospital or
community health units, which is aimed at promoting breast feeding.
They hope their game, conceived while they were studying in Lochaber
at the Highland and Western Isles College of Midwifery, will be played
across the UK. It has been tried out on women attending the Belford
Hospital, Fort William.

BRIAN HENDERSON tried to dismiss public concern over live animal
exports by suggesting that anthropomorphism and sentimentality are the
driving force behind those who have taken to the streets in protest
(February 8).
He made much of doe-eyed images of calves and the cuddle factor of
fluffy lambs. Not once did he touch on the real reason why people who
have never protested before are standing in front of 40-tonne
articulated lorries.
These virgin volunteers are from ordinary homes in ordinary towns
which the media have placed in a mystical land called Middle England.
These unexceptional people were not urged to exceptional action by
popping a video in their VCRs and seeing Bambi's mum get the bullet.
They were shocked out of apathy by television pictures of calves
tethered in tiny Dutch veal crates and conscious lambs having their
throats slit in Greek and Spanish abattoirs. This technicolour cruelty
is real, not a fairy tale.
Deer farmers in Scotland do not send walking, talking Bambis abroad to
be sold as anonymous locally killed meat. Instead they export humanely
reared and killed venison with a Scottish label which attracts a premium
price. Do deer and sheep farmers never talk to each other? The live lamb
exporters could learn a thing or two.
As more people open their eyes to the cruelty of live export, veal
crates, and factory farming, our meat and egg producers are going to
have trouble justifying what they do to animals.

Sarajevo, Sunday
SNIPERS broke the relative calm Sarajevo today, wounding a 16-year-old
boy and a man, and Bosnian Serbs said Muslims shot a child in a Serb
suburb.
Doctors and United Nations staff confirmed the first attack.
Peacekeepers said they suspected the sniper fire came from Bosnian Serb
positions overlooking the besieged city.
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA later reported that a child had been
seriously wounded by a Muslim small arms attack in the Serb suburb of
Cekrcici. No further details were available.
The shootings were the latest violations of a truce which has eased
the danger to civilians in the city in recent days, allowing roads and a
railway to reopen to civilian traffic.
Doctors in Kosevo hospital said Dzemal Karovic, 16, had been shot in
the stomach. Mujo Klino, 43, was wounded when he went to help him.
The shootings occurred as Bosnian government and UN commanders met to
try to shore up a ceasefire battered by fighting around Bihac.
Apart from an isolated mortar attack, Sarajevo had enjoyed several
days of relative calm, with roads and a railway reopening to civilian
traffic as confidence built in the January 1 ceasefire holding in most
of Bosnia.
The situation in Bihac, in northwest Bosnia, has worried UN
peacekeepers who see the potential for current fighting around the
''safe area'' of Bihac town to spread elsewhere in Bosnia, ruining the
gains of the six-week-old ceasefire.
The UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith, met
Muslim government military chief General Rasim Delic in Visoko,
northwest of Sarajevo, today to try to rescue a ceasefire now
threatening to unravel.
''The main sticking point from the BH (Bosnian government army) point
of view is Bihac,'' UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward told
Reuters after the meeting.
Delic wanted Serb forces to relent in their attacks on Bihac and allow
aid to enter the area, Day said. If those two demands were met, Delic
might reconsider his refusal to attend talks with Serb commanders and
the UN on implementing the terms of the January 1 ceasefire, he
said.--Reuter.

I CAN assure Dr James Brown that not only does Eire export its calves
but it also exports a great amount of its cattle on the hoof as well
(February 7).
Britain is only allowed to ship livestock under six months of age
because of the BSE regulations. Eire on the other hand has no such
restrictions and is able not only to ship all cattle but has no
restrictions on destination. Most of its cattle are thus shipped on much
longer journeys than British livestock -- to Spain and Italy.
Eire has not been affected by the ferry ban because Dublin-based Irish
Ferries has continued to transport its livestock direct from Eire to
France, a sea journey of about 20 hours, much longer than the British
maximum ruling of 15 hours.
As to the moral question of exporting veal crates, I can assure Dr
Brown that there is no easy alternative.
What really amazes me is the RSPCA bringing out a video showing
animals being slaughtered in Greek abattoirs and labelling it barbaric.
Does it not realise that hundreds of cattle and sheep are slaughtered in
British abattoirs every day by the kosher method, part of a religious
killing as required by some cultures which I fully respect their right
to maintain.
If the Greek abattoirs are so barbaric it is up to Brussels to go and
shut them down as they have done to many British abattoirs for not being
up to EU standards.

IN the wake of the inquest into the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy in which

non-qualified instructors, it is particularly saddening to discover that
Strathclyde Regional Council is contemplating closing its 10 outdoor

outdoor activities with the peace of mind that all staff are highly

IT was with much interest that we read the Alf Young's report on the
job losses at Rolls-Royce at East Kilbride (February 2).
He is right to draw attention to the high-skill, high-wage aspect of
these jobs and the substantial knock-on effect they will have on the
local economy and the manufacturing base of Scotland.
Of the Scottish workforce, 3.2% is directly dependent on aerospace and
defence expenditure as opposed to the UK average of 2.9%.
Reductions in MoD expenditure and restructuring of our defence
industries has resulted in the loss, in Scotland, of some 20,000 jobs
since 1987. Around 10,000 of these have been in our manufacturing
companies.
However, these reductions in defence employment have not led to a
diversification of Scottish industry; in fact the opposite has occurred.
The devastating impact of the recession on Scottish industry coupled
with the trend towards service employment has resulted in our
manufacturing base becoming increasingly dependent on defence
expenditure.
The Scottish manufacturing base has risen from 4% defence dependency
in 1985 to 10.7% today. The situation is exacerbated in that our defence
companies represent for the most part the last bastion of successful
high-technology manufacturing in Scotland.
Many of Scotland's major companies and local communities are heavily
dependent on defence spending. Previous cuts are already adversely
affecting Scottish local economies.
Since 1984 Strathclyde manufacturing has decreased by more than 30%
and the lack of hi-tech manufacturing jobs continues to be a major cause
of concern. With aerospace and transport in Strathclyde already
experiencing the greatest absolute decrease in vacancies (down 91.8%),
the urgency for Government action to assist our aerospace and defence
industries and ensure that Scotland has the capabilities to enter the
new emerging markets, such as those for hi-tech, environmental clean
technologies, has never been greater.
The Trade and Industry Select Committee third report on the British
aerospace industry unanimously agreed on a number of recommendations,
calling on the Government to have an overall policy framework for these
industries and to commission a study to consider whether and how the
conversion of defence resources should be assisted.
Lobbying undertaken by the Arms Conversion Project has indicated
support for these commonsense proposals from across the political
spectrum. We now all have a duty to ensure that the Government responds
seriously to what Alf Young correctly recognises as a serious issue.

SCOTTISH lawyers of a certain age will recall a clerihew about a
famous old judge:
The nearest thing to death in life
Is David Patrick Maxwell Fyfe
But underneath his gloomy shell
He does himself extremely well
Maxwell Fyfe was Baron Fyfe of Dornoch, later Lord Kilmuir, a
remarkable old boy in many ways. A Highland landowner, Scots Guardsman,
and high Tory, he was created 1st Earl Kilmuir in 1962. By then he was
famous as an English judge who had also been deputy prosecutor at the
Nuremberg Nazi war-crime trials.
He was known for his grim persona and upper-class background which
tailor-made him for membership of the Carlton Club in London. Back in
Scotland he could have been found strolling in the Dornoch countryside.
He did, after all, own lots of it.
But Maxwell Fyfe was also the thinking man's European, so much so that
he was the force behind Britain's visionary contribution to the European
Convention of Human Rights. Today, 42 years after the convention came
into force, it is written into the domestic law of 32 of the 34 member
states in the Council of Europe.
All 34 states are democracies committed to respecting human rights,
parliamentary democracy, and the rule of law. The two which continue to
resist writing the convention into domestic law are -- no prizes for
guessing -- Britain and Ireland.
Under the aegis of the council, the European Court of Human Rights
meets in Strasbourg. In effect it is the ultimate court of appeal for
Europeans who believe they have been treated unfairly. Its decisions are
famous for regularly upsetting British judges. Last week it ordered
compensation for a convicted drug-peddler whose goods were confiscated
by an English judge invoking a European law which did not at that time
exist in domestic law. The prisoner complained that his punishment was
retrospective.
British courts have come sullenly to accept judgments of this kind
from Strasbourg but the political will to give the human rights court
full and formal recognition as the last resort in appeals procedure has
been lost during the Conservatives' long spell in office.
If old Maxwell Fyfe was around today -- he died in 1967 -- he would
probably be a Heathite when it comes to Europe in general and the
Council of Europe in particular. Like Churchill, Heath, and his
generation of Conservatives were Europeans by conviction who cared, in
the words of Harold Macmillan, more about the great issues of the world
than the price of butter.
Many present-day Tories, compelled to be reticent, feel the same,
which is why a pervasive sense of disappointment pervades the party.
A good example of this loss of the urge to be involved is our
Government's attitude to writing the convention into British law. It is
now a party-political issue wrapped up in the greater issue of
constitutional reform. Rather than bow with good grace to a modern and
useful charter which also serves as a last defence against injustice,
our Government and many judges -- especially, it must be said, Scottish
judges -- seem intent on watching the spectacle of our citizens going in
ever greater numbers to Strasbourg in search of fairness.
This is curiously perverse especially when, as I am led to believe,
the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay (a Scot), favours writing the European
convention into British law, with all that entails for a written
constitution. England's most senior judge, the Lord Chief Justice, is
known to take the Mackay view. In Scotland, greatest bastion of
resistance to Strasbourg, a pro-European view on this issue is also
advanced privately by our most senior judge, Lord Hope, Lord President
of the Court of Session.
Scottish resistance to the convention can be traced to two particular
cases. One involved a deportation and the other a complaint that a
Scottish trial had been unfair. The Scottish judicial system came out
the loser in both appeals to Strasbourg and great has been the mumping
and grumping from the Bench, or some of it, ever since. Other cases in
which the Strasbourg court has taken a firm line include a judgment
leading to the ban on belting children in state schools and the
''interrogation in depth'' of terrorist suspects.
British opposition to Strasbourg is mainly knee-jerking by
Establishment figures who see the incorporation of the human rights
convention into British law as the slippery slope to a written
constitution. As we watch the ever-increasing number of British cases
wending a way to Strasbourg in pursuit of justice -- 946 last year
although many will no doubt fall -- it is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that the slippier the slope the better.
Now that the possibility of a written constitution is taking on a new
urgency because of Labour's commitment to it -- indeed all parties
except the Tories are in favour -- it has become subsumed in the general
political debate about ''Europe''. Eurosceptics -- who must know better
-- shamelessly blame the EU for decisions of the Court of Human Rights.
Likewise they blame the Council of Europe and its court for EU policies
which displease them.
One of the obvious effects of not having the convention written into
British law is its influence on judges. In Scotland and England most of
them happily judge away, confident in the knowledge that they need not
look over their shoulders to Strasbourg. Thus they risk lengthening the
time it takes to resolve a case. If they knew at the outset that they
must respect the convention, much time and effort could be saved.
Meanwhile, today's Tories might reflect on the damage their refusal to
embrace Strasbourg is having on Britain's international reputation.

JOHN FOWLER describes the full moon rising at the horizon as
''gigantic'', and notices that it appears to get smaller as it climbs
the night sky (Weekender, February 4).
This is perfectly true and familiar to everyone, but it is
nevertheless an optical illusion. The disc of the moon is not magnified
by the atmosphere; it is always exactly the same size irrespective of
its position in the sky. Try viewing it through a hole cut in a card or,
better still, photograph it at levels throughout the evening.
He also says that it is sometimes possible to see the new moon
silhouetted against the Milky Way. Surely when the moon is new it is
nearly in line with the sun and therefore the Milky Way would not be
visible. You can certainly see the new moon as a black disc but then it
is against the sun during a solar eclipse.

JOHN MACLEOD is someone whom I would normally have some considerable
time for; however, his latest diatribe does not live up to his normal
high standard of journalism (February 7).
He derides the SNP advances in places like Paisley clearly without
checking the facts. If he had he would have discovered that the SNP
presence on the district council has increased from one councillor in
1979 to 12 elected at the last local elections, resulting in an overall
Labour loss of control in Scotland's fourth largest district council.
Similarly, in areas like Kilmarnock (the political home of Alex Neil,
another of John Macleod's ''victims'') the district council now has an
SNP provost and at the recent regional elections SNP wins in three out
of four regional wards, the last Labour survivor holding on by a handful
of votes.
These areas may not have returned SNP MPs but consistent progress
towards that is being achieved. John Macleod's comparison with Banff and
Buchan is disingenuous to say the least. Even he must recognise that
winning Tory votes against the background of a very unpopular Tory
Government is not quite the same task as winning votes in Labour areas
with Labour in opposition.
If Labour ever does win a General Election, our turn at this more
favourable position will come. This is not to say that I do not
appreciate the hard work involved in winning any seat in Scotland.

THOSE of us who hold Sir Nicholas Fairbairn in respect and affection
have greatly admired the courage and determination with which he has
fought his illness (February 3).
However, many of us will be unable to hide our disappointment that he
should disparage the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate
for this constituency, democratically elected at a well-attended
association selection meeting by those whose support Sir Nicholas
enjoyed in helping to secure his re-election in 1992.
A native of Lochaber, John Godfrey is a good, hard-working candidate
who will be able to bring valuable experience and dedication to the
constituency as MP. In this he would be following in the footsteps of
distinguished predecessors, among them Lord Home and, yes, Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn.

Mr Macartney tries to defend the trip by saying that ''we must be the
only people to go to this place without being dragged there in chains''.
Once again his ignorance of historical events is plain to see as the
prison closed a number of years ago. I am sure the Guyanans, who are
trying to encourage a tourist industry, will be delighted with the
reference to chains.
I was also interested to see him describing himself as the
''Papillon'' of the European Parliament. I would point out that papillon
is French for butterfly, which we all know has a very short life.
Entirely appropriate I would have thought.
Furthermore, Henri Charriere, who based the story on his ''own
experiences'', was later exposed as a liar and a fraud.
Need I say more?

I REFUSE to believe that a driver has complete control of his car when
I see him with one hand on the steering wheel and the other holding a
phone to his ear.
In Australia it is illegal to use a handset while the car is in motion
and all car phones must be fitted with a microphone and speaker.
Surely it is time to reconsider the law in this country and thus help
to reduce the number of road accidents.

IN common with Alex M Smith I have seen some of my musical tastes
scorned in the columns of The Herald (February 7). Unlike him, however,
I do not regard this as an insult or grounds for any one writer's
dismissal.
Apparently he does not realise that one of the reasons for The
Herald's quality is its willingness to employ a wide variety of writers,
each with his or her own unique viewpoint.
If the newspaper were to respond positively to the rantings of every
ardent fan who had seen his idol criticised, we would be treated to no
more than a broadsheet version of Hello! magazine on our doorsteps each
morning.

I WAS both astonished and dismayed when I discovered last year that
neither BBC TV Scotland nor Scottish Television had filmed any of the
Celtic Connections festival concerts.
A year on I am now well and truly angered to find that the TV
companies have again ignored the festival. Here we have had, on two
occasions, the best performers of Celtic and Celtic-orientated music,
and yet they are apparently considered unworthy of TV appearances in one
of the Celtic countries.
Can it be doubted that there would have been large-scale coverage if
the world's best classical, rock, or jazz musicians had assembled in
Glasgow for such a festival?
One can only hope that the TV people have seen the error of their ways
and are, at this moment, planning to apologise to the Scottish public by
arranging extensive coverage of Celtic Connections in 1996.
More than a word of thanks is due, in the light of TV's neglect, to
all associated with Radio Scotland's Travelling Folk and Mr Anderson's
Fine Tunes, which did honour to the BBC commitment to indigenous
culture, and indeed to others from beyond our shores.

UNIVERSITIES are old institutions. Aberdeen, not Scotland's oldest, is
at present celebrating its 500th anniversary. No matter how long their
history, their role has changed dramatically over time, and few have
long enjoyed freedom from financial worry. Glasgow, the second Scottish
foundation after St Andrews, was actually established to avoid the
currency outflow Scotland suffered from students being educated on the
Continent. Aberdeen's raison d'etre was even more immediately practical
-- to provide a trained professional elite whose output from the two
other universities was insufficient to meet all of Scotland's needs. The
fact is that all were small institutions with tiny undergraduate bodies.
In early days, however, they established a reputation for scholarship
and its communication which blossomed, especially in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, with minimal intervention from the State.
Increasingly in this century state intervention has grown. The effect
has been enormous, especially in numbers, now that approximately a third
of each age cohort can expect to receive a tertiary education. The
numbers of universities have multiplied as well. Scottish medieval
foundations could have been far more numerous than what came to be
called the four ancient universities, but these are now overwhelmed by
more recent creations which may not even be the last.
It cannot be surprising that the pace of this change -- very marked
since the 1960s -- has produced a widespread feeling of stress. The
recommendations of the Robbins Report ensured that existing universities
would be massively expanded and that new foundations would extend their
benefits far beyond the old elite groups. The effects of the ensuing
growth have been compounded in the past two decades by attempts to
promote an ''enterprise culture'' in the universities while keeping
their budgets under tight constraints. The Moderator of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland was speaking for many yesterday in
Aberdeen when he defended university education from ''the whims of
accountants and market forces''. Contemporary tensions among university
teachers are everywhere evident. All notice their greatly increased
workload (both in teaching and in bureaucratic demands) and many dislike
what they identify as a business ethos being imposed on them.
These latter fears have an adverse effect on morale but they may be
exaggerated. As in so many spheres it is a matter of balance.
Traditionalists are wont to forget the way in which nineteenth-century
academic life was often closely involved in economic enterprise -- the
career of Lord Kelvin, though in many ways exceptional, makes the point
well enough. So does the manner in which many academic institutions were
funded by what is often called ''new'' money (capitalism) as by old
(land). It would be a flight from reason were academic institutions now
to ignore the benefits accountants can provide for their better
management. And ''market forces'' should not always be dismissed as
philistine, when they merely show what people want. It is up to
academics themselves to see that what are essentially auxiliaries
(accountants) do not become dictators; and that what is wanted of
universities is considered before it is delivered, assuming the eventual
decision is to deliver it. Universities can say ''no'', though their
ability to do so to the State has been undermined along with their
financial independence. No university should be driven by mere ''whim''
in any circumstance.

SHORTLY after he first broke through he became known as the ''new''
Gary Cooper and Steve McQueen and a long list of other Hollywood
legendary leading men, but Kevin Costner seemed to be different.
Whatever demons lurked he appeared to have overcome them, although he
frankly admitted to having ''a dark side''.
It sounded like some public-relations spice, for there seemed no
shades to him. He was white bread possibly in need of some Tinseltown
toasting, of gossip-page character-building. In Hollywood if they're not
talking about you it's time to plan your memorial service -- that way
someone comes to see you.
When I first met Costner he had just completed No Way Out which
boasted a strong cast, a complex plot with a clever twist, and a raunchy
sex scene involving Kev and co-star Sean Young in the back seat of a
limousine driving around and around the historic sights of Washington
DC. It was an exotic trip.
But the limousine-lover image was not him, he said. The love scenes
were difficult, embarrassing. Sean Young, more experienced in such brief
celluloid encounters, helped him.
Since then, Costner has helped himself to the handsome pickings of
Hollywood, the rainbow of fame, money, and Oscars. Now, certainly
privately and possibly professionally, it has all gone wrong. The man
who seemed to be above the temptations of celebrity while having an
uncanny knack at the box-office has stumbled. And film-industry types
are talking about his latest film, Waterworld -- the most expensive
movie ever made -- as his Waterloo.
His wife Cindy -- she paid her way through college by appearing as
Snow White at California's Disneyland -- has filed for divorce after 16
years of marriage. It is a bitter battle. There has been much gossip
about Costner's serial philandering. In the middle of this dodgem
divorce are their children Annie, 10, Lily, 7, and Joe, 6.
The man who for a moment seemed to have it all, the perfect marriage
and family, the superstar career, finds himself in a corner. It is a
surprise to most for he appeared always to be in control and to be his
own man. No better example was his Oscar bonanza, Dances with Wolves,
which the film industry predicted would be his demise. With his wife's
support he thumbed his nose at the doomwatchers and against the odds
turned an over-long film into a box-office and critical success. He was
the maverick's maverick.
And arguably that's when the cracks in the plaster began to appear.
Here we had a brand-new all-round film genius, a lean, lanky Orson
Welles, who could do no wrong. That, of course, is when you get ego all
over your face.
Costner will talk until the cowboys come home -- or until his PR
minders tap their Rolexes -- when you get him on the subject of the epic
Western that brought him everything Hollywood dreams of: money, power,
status, and the sort of sensational, life-changing superstardom some
live to regret.
He was always aware of the pitfalls but says he wouldn't change a
minute of his experience in bringing Dances with Wolves to the screen.
It was simply ''the one film in my life I knew I had to make even if it
meant I could never make another''.
At one stage it looked as if that might be the case. Costner turned
down some of the best leading-man roles on offer -- Presumed Innocent
(which went to Harrison Ford), The Hunt for Red October (Alec Baldwin),
Bonfire of the Vanities (Tom Hanks) -- which turned out to be a lucky
miss -- and Prince of Tides (Nick Nolte), and spent two years trying to
convince Hollywood to give him $18m and let him produce, direct, and
star in a three-hour Western about peace, love, racial injustice, and
Sioux Indians.
Amid gossip about a stupendous ''Kevinsgate'' flop, first-time
director Costner kept his cool -- and his faith in his vision, the film
he still describes as ''my love letter to the past''. On Oscar night,
1991, he was vindicated: Dances won him seven Oscars including Best
Picture and Best Director. He also won the prestigious Directors' Guild
Director of the Year and an armful of Golden Globes.
Before Dances, Costner had been little more than a Hollywood pretty
boy, a sexy stud to the smouldering Sean Young in No Way Out -- she
called him ''shy, puritanical, and such a private guy'' and worried that
she'd embarrassed him during their electrifying sex scene -- and the
artfully passionate toe-nail painter of Susan Sarandon in Bull Durham.
He'd made a lot of people, notably Sean Connery, dance on their toes
in the brilliant The Untouchables and the word was out, at last, that he
was a star in the making when he took his all-or-nothing gamble on
Dances.
Afterwards he was as famous as Madonna was infamous. The two icons
met, famously, backstage after her show. He, polite, earnest, a strictly
brought-up Californian working-class boy, told her her show was
''neat''. She stuck her fingers down her throat as he left, a moment
captured on her no-frames-banned video that signalled ''square'' to the
world.
The incident seemed to sum up the essential Costner. He was ''nice'',
polite, and honest, a man of his word and a loving family man out of
place in back-stabbing, fingers-down-your-throat Hollywood. He also
talked the image: ''You like to think you do the right thing. It's the
way we were brought up.'' His father Bill, a former railwayman, says:
''All the Costners are good men.'' Whenever possible his wife Cindy, a
woman who insisted on keeping her marriage and family as private as
possible, and the children would travel on location with him. They were
on the set of Dances in South Dakota, appearing as pioneers in the
opening scene, and Cindy helped to release tensions by organising
parties, including a Hawaiian luau and a 1950s prom.
The couple were just like 1950s prom sweethearts when they met in 1978
-- she was shy, he was shyer; she was Snow White while he was, he says,
''a bit like Goofy, a late developer''. He's made up for it, and until
the divorce action, whatever the rumours of his attraction to women and
vice-versa, he maintained that Cindy and the children were the most
important thing in his life.
He knew of the danger his superstardom had brought to his marriage:
24-hour days living and breathing work, 24-hour days of women throwing
themselves at him, at work, camping outside his homes in Pasadena and
Malibu and wherever he might go. The possibility of dangerous liaisons
were, he said, ''the coolest thing. Are you kidding? To undress
somebody? To be undressed? To be physically, somehow, just taken?''
Before the divorce action he said his marriage ''isn't perfect'' and
his brother-in-law David Silva agreed: ''It wasn't easy when he first
became so famous. But Cindy grew with it real well.'' Costner's brother
Danny, his financial adviser, said: ''It got to be tough on Cindy. The
business is such an emotional roller-coaster. It's bigger than life and
the stakes are high.''
Not only is his domestic situation nasty; there are also a great many
waves surrounding Waterworld. The film was given the go-ahead by
Universal Studios with a budget of $100m. Now the cost is estimated at
more than $200m once the cost of marketing and prints of the film are
included. Although filming should have been completed last year the
movie still goes on being made.
All involved are so nervous about the situation that a giant water
tank on a Hollywood lot is hidden behind blue sheeting and scaffolding.
Security guards patrol the perimeter around the clock. ''Everyone is
very paranoid at this point,'' was the very unofficial word from the
set.
They are just as nervy down at the City of Commerce, where a replica
of a hugh supertanker, a great, rusting hulk, is also being used to
complete some of the action sequences of Waterworld.
Universal Studios, which clearly has a massive investment in Costner's
movie, is concerned that its star's personal problems, lots of gossip
about turmoil during filming, sackings, and overspending, will jinx the
film before it reaches cinemas this summer.
It has, at present, all the hallmarks of Arnold Schwarzenegger's
box-office belly-flop, Last American Hero. But, of course, no-one has
seen the film. Costner was written off with Dances and the snipers are
still keen to knock him off his pedestal. Financially, they've got a
good shot.
Jurassic Park cost $57m to make and in America and Canada alone
returned $357m.
What does a $200m film have to make to become a ''blockbuster''? The
answer is an awful lot.
Waterworld is a strong adventure movie. The director is Costner's
friend Kevin Reynolds (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and is a Mad
Max-on-the-water-story. The Polar ice-caps have melted and the earth is
submerging into the water in the post-apocalyptic future.
Costner plays Mariner, who sounds like something out of Star Trek,
part human and also amphibian. Instead of Mr Spock pointy ears this
hybrid sports long shaggy hair and a beard and doesn't say a lot. The
carefully guarded script has been leaked a little -- well, it would in a
water movie -- and concerns Mariner rescuing a woman and her daughter
who are being attacked by pirates. He takes them on a quest to find the
rumoured dry land.
The co-stars include Dennis Hopper (chief nasty, we can only presume
at this stage) and Jeanne Tripplehorn who in the sex stakes makes
mincemeat of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. The actress, who also
played Tom Cruise's wife in The Firm, is, we're told, a felony
scene-stealer in the film.
The screenplay is packed with action and was conceived by writers
including those involved with Harrison Ford's The Fugitive and Keanu
Reeves's Speed. But although Kevin Reynolds is the director, this is
Costner's project.
And he needs a hit. Even with Clint Eastwood as his co-star A Perfect
World only managed a little more than $30m in America. The US domestic
take for Wyatt Earp was $25m and The War made $16.5m.
Whether Waterworld can ever make the production costs back is in
question. Filming began on June 27 last year on the big island of Hawaii
and is not expected to end until later this month. Normal production of
a full-scale action film would be three, or at the most four, months.
The stand-by date for the end of filming was February 10. But
post-production takes at least 18 weeks and Universal wants to get
Waterworld in cinemas for the big American summer market.
Great Jurassic Park-type marketing -- Universal also bankrolled the
Spielberg movie -- is planned for Waterworld and will involve
attractions at the studio's theme park and inter-active computer games.
And, maybe, Kevin Costner ''Sink or Swim'' T-shirts.

MENACED by threats of more suicide attacks, Algerian security forces
killed 20 Muslim fundamentalists, half of them tracked down and slain in
a single operation, their officers said yesterday. In the north African
country's merciless conflict, two young men, suspected Islamists barely
in their 20s, pumped two bullets into the head of a woman schoolteacher
in an Algiers suburb on Saturday.
On the same day, 10 of their colleagues were slain by security forces
in Mascara, 195 miles to the west, in a ''search operation''. Security
officers, in a statement carried by the official news agency APS, said
their men who killed the 10 recovered guns, daggers and a bomb. The
other 10 were killed in seven different areas.

WHAT do they make of it, those Europeans who stand on the mainland of
the Continent this morning and try to make sense of our governing
party's attitudes to the European Union? More importantly, does it
matter what they think? We would argue most emphatically that it does.
The old days of arrogant insouciance have gone. Quite simply, what the
rest of Europe thinks about Britain does matter for the simple reason
that, although we remain geographically insular, we cannot afford even
to pretend to be uninfluenced or unresponsive to the nations with whom
we are joined in union. The direction of much of our manufacturing
export towards Europe, and the persistently unsatisfactory state of our
trade with the world outside the European Union, merely reinforces this
point. Furthermore, although senior British industrialists may be
agnostic about the absolute necessity of being part of a European
monetary system, none of them would argue with the requirement for
Britain's influence within Europe to be strong and persistent. That is
our future, whether we are enthused by it or not.
And so we return to our original question. What does Europe think
about us now? There is evidence that a number of European governments
are becoming increasingly puzzled and restive about what they hear and
see from Britain. It is true that this past weekend has been a bad one.
Lord Tebbit's speech at the Young Conservative's conference was a
disgrace. If he were a footballer he could be charged with bringing the
game into disrepute; as he is a politician we can only comment that any
allegedly senior statesman who appears to be talking about disobeying
laws which he does not like and who, grotesquely, makes a comparison
between the experience of a Briton in Europe with a South African black
under apartheid, is either dangerously provocative or unhinged. Other
voices were involved. The Home Secretary made an extremely Euro-sceptic
speech at the same conference and a pro-European Tory called for the
winding-up of the Young Conservatives because their views were becoming
more akin to the National Front. Soothing words came from other sources
but the emollient approach is not working. Perhaps, in a sense, it
should not. The admirable Sir Marcus Fox made an appeal over the weekend
for a stop to the squabbling. Cabinet Ministers should pause before
entering into a debate between one or the other, he said, but in the
present confusion an honest debate may be the only way of achieving some
sort of coherence.
The growing unease about the face Britain presents to the world is not
just a question of the moment. The present Government could be in power
for another two years. In that time, and if matters are not resolved,
the damage done to Britain's reputation, both inside and outside Europe,
could be immeasurable. The point about perceptions outside Europe is not
fully appreciated. It is clear that the White House prefers to speak to
a conglomerate Europe rather than to individual countries. (When it
wants to speak to a single country there have long been signs that
Germany is the preferred nation, making nonsensical fiction the notion
of a special relationship in any sense that really matters.) Nor are
Japanese inward investors impressed. There is much sense in what the
extreme Euro anti-sceptic Tony Marlow MP said at the weekend. He told
the Prime Minister to gain control or resign. It is impossible to
govern, he said, by eternally seeking the centre of gravity of the Tory
Party. Mr Marlow is right. Mr Major must resolve this damaging affair or
face the consequences.

TWO years ago Chancellor Ken Clarke told the Tory conference in true
best-mates style: ''Any enemy of John Major is an enemy of mine.'' They
now seem to be the best of enemies. They ''help'' each other with
speeches, but they say different things on Europe. Mr Clarke, for
example, declares that we can have monetary union without wholesale
political union. It took only this to upset Mr Major's applecart.
Two years ago Charles Wardle, then immigration minister, warned the
Prime Minister that failure to deal with immigration from Europe would
lead to ''massive public disenchantment''. Mr Major regarded the issue
differently and did not react.
Yesterday, Mr Wardle resigned from his Government. Mr Clarke and Mr
Wardle are friends and allies on European issues, but there appears to
be no connection between the Chancellor's statement last Thursday and Mr
Wardle's words yesterday after quitting Trade and Industry, where he was
reshuffled last July.
The link is that both events intensify Mr Major's difficulties in
uniting his Government on economic and political issues, particularly
those arising out of membership of the European Union. He is exposed
again to ridicule, as was Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home 30 years
ago when he observed: ''There are two problems in my life. The political
ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible.''
Nine months later Sir Alec (Lord Home of the Hirsel) was out of
office. One wonders how much longer Mr Major can continue without more
senior resignations on principle than Mr Wardle's junior post. His
political problems of Britain-at-the-heart-of-Europe seem insoluble and
the economic factors arising therefrom, too incomprehensible to
contemplate now.
He thought after Christmas that he had drawn up a sensible line for
the whole party to take in the circumstances. If our Euro-partners try
to force a single currency, or an end to national vetoes, in the next
two years, he will block it. There is no point in arguing about a single
currency now because it is not going to happen in the foreseeable
future.
He intensified his sceptical tone in the hope that his rebels would be
appeased and restore his majority in the Commons. He refused to commit
himself to a referendum on Britain's future in Europe and he refused to
say ''never'' to a single currency.
With some logic he quoted our Maastricht opt-out on this issue; a
decision on a single currency will be taken by a Parliament other than
this one. The latest statement of Labour policy on this issue by Shadow
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is hardly distinguishable.
A pro-European union Tory backlash was inevitable when people like Sir
Edward Heath voiced their alarm at what they saw as a dangerous
pandering to colleagues who take a hard-line distrustful view. Alas,
when they held a press conference, no-one turned up. Their champion Ken
Clarke was pushed forward for a speech last Thursday, introduced by one
of them, Hugh Dykes, as ''the fightback starts here''.
The Chancellor had hardly sat down when the Tory rebels were on to
him. He rejected ''knee-jerk reactions'' against a single currency.
This, of course, irritated King Knee-jerk himself, Lord Tebbit. But Mr
Clarke also declared at a European Movement dinner: ''It is quite
possible to have monetary union without political union. It is a mistake
to believe that monetary union need be a huge step on the path to a
federal Europe.''
This irritated the Cabinet hardliners and provoked prompt retaliation.
Employment Secretary Mr Portillo observed that such personal opinions
were not helpful. He failed to reprimand himself last May when he
opined: ''Single currency would mean giving up the government of the UK.
No British Government can give that up. It's impossible.''
Welsh Secretary John Redwood intervened: ''It is not just an economic
issue. It is a very big constitutional issue as well.'' Perhaps their
chagrin was greater because they knew that the Prime Minister had vetted
the Clarke speech and cleared the final text. Some of Mr Major's enemies
smell a conspiracy between Major and Clarke to restore the equanimity of
the ardent Europeans. If so, perhaps they are the best of friends still.
But this conspiracy theory seems too far-fetched.
The Chancellor's No 2 at the Treasury, Mr Jonathan Aitken, another
hardliner, has so far constrained himself (out of courtesy to his
boss?). But he had already said his piece eight days ago on television.
''I don't want to see a single currency, period. For as far as I can
possibly foresee. I would hesitate for an eternity before I came out and
said that I would vote for a single currency.''
Was it this that set off the Tory Europhiles? Mr Aitken appeared to
them to be exploiting the Prime Minister's tactical nod to the
Eurosceptics. Up to that point all involved believed that cabinet
ministers were agreed on not stirring things up. Mr Major has taken to
having one-to-one lunches with them in recent weeks in order to reach
one-to-one understandings with them.
There is no more serious European legislation this parliamentary year.
It seemed like a good opportunity for the Tories to patch-up and
shut-up. So much for that. In vain Mr David Hunt, the Cabinet
troubleshooter, pleaded yesterday that ''we must stop fighting with
shadows''.
He would have us believe that cabinet ministers are not saying
different things, merely saying things differently. Meanwhile, Mr Major
calls Mr Tony Blair a ''dimwit'' for probing the Prime Minister's
position. The Tory plan was to establish ''clear blue water'' between
them and Labour on Europe by forcing Blair to commit himself to a single
currency and a central bank.
''Dimwit'' Blair was on to this and has avoided it, despite the
utterances of some of his members of the European Parliament. So far Mr
Major has managed only to re-establish clear blue water between himself
and other groups in his cabinet and party. There is no sign of rejoining
by the nine MPs who are off the whip.
From their point of view they are exploiting being centre-stage and
see no point in switching off the spotlights. If things get much worse,
Mr Major faces a rebellion on the other side, with Europhiles resigning
the whip. If the Ulster Unionists were to abandon him too, it could be
that all these irksome problems will be taken right out of his hands.
Who could blame him if, in the private recesses of his mind, he tired
of all this and wished for release? His party and colleagues are putting
him in an impossible position in which he is denied all he asks for -- a
temporary truce to allow them to wait and see what real decisions they
have to face about Europe.
He is like a man trying to ride two horses without having a firm seat
on either of them. His impatient colleagues impart defeatism by their
apparent disregard for their leader's position. We are entitled to
deduce that they are already jostling for their own positions come
electoral defeat.
So far Mr Major has managed only to re-establish clear blue water
between himself and other groups in his cabinet and party

SEVERAL hundred UN troops evacuated Mogadishu yesterday as the failed
two-year mission to bring Somalia food, peace and government draws to
its humiliating close. About 450 Pakistani ''blue helmets'' flew out of
the UN-controlled airport. Lieutenant-Colonel Muhammad Tahir told

UNDER the kind of extraordinary security normally reserved for
presidents and royalty, jurors in the O J Simpson trial toured the scene
of the brutal double murder yesterday while the football legend was kept
nearby in an unmarked police car. Exactly eight months to the day
Simpson's ex-wife and her friend were stabbed to death, Judge Lance Ito
convened an unusual weekend court session and led a heavily-guarded
motorcade into the heart of Brentwood, an exclusive enclave turned
upside down by the sensational murder case.

NOW that the removal men have gone and I settle into a new position, a
new day, the need for reassurance that I'm still in the same world is
not hard to find. The fate of Aberdeen's football manager, Willie
Miller, is an immediate reminder that we live in harsh, unfeeling times
where nothing really matters but so-called success.
To the extent that football is a metaphor for life, reflecting with
chilling accuracy the changing moods and attitudes of the human
condition, I am tempted to escape with the distant memory of a visit to
Malta, that Mediterranean haven dusted with yellow ochre and inducing a
sense of calm and well-being.
Ulysses was lured to live here and so was Nicholas Monsarrat of The
Cruel Sea. But I wouldn't have exchanged either for the man who was
ambling towards me now in the main street of Valletta and whose approach
I absorbed with a silent awe.
At that time resident in Malta, Stanley Matthews remained the greatest
football artist I had ever seen, an aristocrat of sport, brilliant
psychologist who proceeded that day to give me a limited insight into
the mystique of a legend.
Demonstrating how he would take a ball close to his opponent,
encouraging a false sense that the poor chap had cornered him, he would
then streak past with such sleight-of-feet as to induce a dose of
demoralisation.
''In that way I caused an inferiority complex from which my opponent
did not easily recover,'' said Matthews almost apologetically, given
that the man was by nature a gentleman.
We raked over a remarkable career, in which he was still playing for
England in his forties and gained a knighthood while still playing
top-grade football at 50.
When we met in Malta, Sir Stan the Peter Pan was turning out for his
local team in his sixties -- and he could be found playing in charity
matches well into his seventies.
The different mood of his heyday can be judged from the fact that,
even when he was reducing our full-backs to helpless jellies, he could
still raise Scottish spectators to their feet in spontaneous
acknowledgement of his genius. Today, he would be an English
unmentionable.
Yet for all that talent, he was 38 before he savoured the joy of a Cup
Final victory at Wembley, inspiring Blackpool to a late win over Bolton.
The point is that the sheer magic of people like Matthews rendered
matters like winning cups of lesser importance.
There were young people who would happily grow old with nothing but
exquisite memories of individual performance.
It all came back last week, when Sir Stanley was celebrating his 80th
birthday. One of the statistics raised on the day, now quite hard to
believe, was that, not only did Matthews create a record for length of
career but he did so without a single yellow-card of caution -- and
without even one foul having been given against him!
With that kind of standard, is it any wonder that my more mellow
generation placed him on a hero's pedestal?
What a different world confronts our youth today. At a time when
examples of karate-kicking and other forms of assault are given by the
stars and role-models of the moment, is it too surprising that a new
report reveals an alarming upsurge of school playground injuries from .
. . yes, karate-kicks etc?
Similarly, the thuggery which erupted at Chelsea last week merely
symbolises the mood of aggression which is everywhere in our society.
Never mind the quality, smell the success at any price: that is the
demand of the day, whether in business, sport, or any other aspect of
life.
And that brings us back to Willie Miller, the Aberdeen manager sacked
last week after three years of failing to win a cup.
Three years? Permit his sardonic smile as he considers the record of
predecessors. The first two managers of Aberdeen FC, Jimmy Philip and
Paddy Travers, ran the club from 1903 till 1938 without a single trophy.
Thirty-five years -- and neither was sacked! Elderly Aberdonians are
just happy to remember great players, like Alec Jackson, Willie Mills,
George Hamilton.
Nowadays it is all about winning; all about beating Rangers and
Celtic. And in that respect, the same Willie Miller who led Aberdeen to
unthinkable success as their greatest playing legend walked out of
Pittodrie with the ring of managerial failure in his ears.
When the dust has settled, I know that in reflective moments I shall
think more about that night in 1983 when the same Willie Miller stepped
up to receive the trophy which hailed Aberdeen at the top of European
football.
At the banquet in Gothenburg I eavesdropped on a classic exchange as
Miller and his imperturbable chairman, Dick Donald, met for the first
time since the greatest moment of their respective lives.
Moving along the buffet table, without breaking step, Dick said:
''Well well Willie, it's been quite a night.''
''Ay,'' said the inscrutable Willie, ''so it has.''
That night, he set a standard of unreasonable expectation which, by
the irony of a cruel world, led to his own heartbreaking downfall last
week. The Fallen Idol of Pittodrie had failed the ultimate test of our
modern, sophisticated and so-called caring society.

I MEAN it's one thing with teenagers, top-shelf magazines, Italian TV
shows of dubious pedigree. But what do we delicate, sensitive Scottish
souls do when the Kirk also becomes obsessed with sex? For those of you
who have inexplicably mislaid your current copy of Circle of Care, the
esteemed journal of the Church of Scotland's Board of Social
Responsibility, let me give you a flavour. The Convener, the Rev Bill
Wallace, has devoted his 40 score words and 10 to the subject of saunas.
Saunas in the nation's capital. Those particular saunas where sitting in
dry heat in wooden Swedish-style cabins seems something of an optional
extra. Those saunas, not to be mealy around the mouth about it, where
what is on offer is paid-for sexual intercourse in rather more
comfortable surroundings than are normally to be found up the average
closemouth.
Mr Wallace is much exercised by the fact that the Embra city council
has chosen to license such establishments in the full knowledge that
they are contravening the Trade Descriptions Act more than somewhat.
Though doubtless, if you still have the energy and the inclination, a
sauna is still available under the ''will there be anything else, sir?''
clause to those gentlemen who are not hurrying on to a pressing previous
engagement.
Mr Wallace's basic case is that the council is at least contravening
the spirit and very probably the letter of the law on prostitution. He
reckons, too, though I'm not entirely clear on what basis, that
prostitution on the streets has actually increased rather than declined
since the new policy, and that business is also booming in those saunas
operating as de facto brothels.
But what seems to trouble him most is that ''in the past women became
involved in prostitution because of poverty, previous abuse, to fund a
drug habit, or even to pay fines. We now have a situation where women
with good looks, good background, and good jobs are drawn into
prostitution because of the easy, tax-free money they can earn in the
saunas . . . clearly there are lots of disturbed men out there who are
prepared to pay almost anything for sexual activity.''
Ahem. Could we check that out once more, Bill? Are we saying here that
it's regrettable but typical that poor, abused women sell sex, but
absolutely beyond the pale if they're going home to Bearsden or
Morningside? Does the clerical shock threshold have some sort of
sociological sliding scale? And while we're on the replay button, let's
just reprise that interesting phrase, ''disturbed men''.
Now my field research into prostitution may be somewhat limited, but
what is not in dispute from prostitutes, police, or health workers is
that the clientele mirrors society itself. The men who use prostitutes
do so for a wide variety of reasons and come from every conceivable
background. Some of them may or may not be disturbed. Most of them are
in the market for nothing more complex than sex without strings. A
facility, I have to tell you, that many single, widowed, divorced,
frustrated, or unhappily married women envy them.
Nobody would quibble with the assertion that sex is most satisfying
within the context of a loving, committed relationship. But if people
are denied access to gourmet meals is it realistic to close down the
burger bars?
As for the wider range of women who become prostitutes from choice
rather than necessity, it doesn't actually seem anybody's business but
their own. I talked with a group of them in Edinburgh just before making
a radio programme on the subject a couple of months back. They were
bright, confident, and unrepentant. They said that they could quite see
that many women couldn't contemplate that kind of ''career'', but it
worked for them. They said the sauna option gave them protection from
pimps, a healthy environment, and an opportunity to support their family
in a manner few other jobs could offer.
Now most women would not be in the market for soulless sex with
strangers. But Bill Wallace's contention is that prostitution is
''always wrong''. That women need ''helped towards a better lifestyle''.
And if they're on the game for all the wrong kind of reasons that's
fine. If they've been forced on the street to keep themselves fed and
warm, let's give them choices and support. If they're being exploited by
cynical, brutal crooks let's rescue them. But if they've made a free,
unfettered decision, what gives any of us the right to lecture them on
the supposed error of their ways? Prostitution has been around as long
as sex, and has about as much chance of going out of fashion. In which
case doesn't it make some kind of sense to regulate and decriminalise
it?
And if the Kirk wasn't so hung up on sex, if it didn't persist in
making it matter more than it does, it wouldn't keep getting its dog
collar in such a fankle. Look at the anguished hours spent at last
year's General Assembly discussing the reports on human sexuality and
marriage. All the fervent hand-wringing over whether or not God could
love cohabitees, or homosexuals could be proper grown-up Christians.
Just like the present Government, some elements in the Church have got
themselves hung up on a nostalgia trip; desperate to get back to a set
of basics where the nuclear family sent their kids to Sunday school,
rarely got divorced, and claimed they'd never got past a serious fumble
in the back row of the ABC1 before they hit the altar. Conveniently
missing from this playback are people who were locked in miserable
relationships, illegitimate children treated as third-class citizens,
and wives with chattel status at best.
The Kirk's Board of Social Responsibility, at its fairest and finest,
is exactly what its title implies. It operates as an invaluable safety
net for all kinds of human disasters for which the State can't or won't
pick up the tab. In matters of care it is pure dead brilliant. Could it
please just get the hell out of our bedrooms?

Women took part in unprecedented numbers, and analysts said this could

A TUC report dismantling Government claims that its policy of labour
market deregulation has increased employment has been submitted to the
International Labour Organisation.
According to the TUC, the report Has Deregulation Delivered the Jobs?
answers its own question emphatically by proving Government claims on
the level of employment to be ''misleading and inaccurate''.
Today, the report goes to the ILO Committee of Experts, which is
considering how well Britain has complied with the ILO requirement for
signatories to pursue policies for full employment.
The TUC sees its report as the first comprehensive challenge to the
Government's portrayal of a successful record on jobs. It was produced
as a factual rebuttal to provide the Committee of Experts with accepted
figures rather than Government statements.
The study also challenges the way a recent Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development report on Britain uncritically accepted the
Government's view in a ''factually inaccurate and partial report on the
state of the UK labour market''.
The TUC's general secretary, Mr John Monks, said yesterday that the
Government's claims that its policy of deregulation had expanded the
jobs market did not stand up to serious scrutiny. Instead, it had led to
fear and insecurity among part-time workers, those on short-term
contracts, and the self-employed. ''Government Ministers should study
our report to discover where the economic feel-good factor has gone,''
he said.
The report does not accept Government claims that employment fell and
employment expanded unusually early in this recovery, by stressing that
unemployment fell in 1993 because more people were forced out of the
labour market, not because more jobs were created.
Ministers' claims that they are giving more help to the unemployed are
countered by revelations that Britain has cut spending on active labour
market measures as a share of Gross Domestic Product to barely half the
EU average, and reduced help for the unemployed by 35% in real terms
since 1989-90. In addition, the budget for Training for Work, the only
scheme to train the long-term unemployed, is to be cut by 20% in cash
terms over the next three years.
The TUC criticises Government claims that deregulation has created a
more ''flexible'' workforce, with more working part-time or being
self-employed. Instead, says the TUC, more people are ''flexible''
because they are scared of losing their jobs.
Suggestions that youth unemployment has declined are answered by the
TUC saying that it worsened against the national average last year, and
that for the under-20s it went up from 10% to 19% between 1990 and 1994.
* The ILO Employment Convention 122 calls on members to ''pursue as a
major goal an active policy designed to promote full employment'' and
that this should ensure ''there is work for all who are available for
and seeking work''.

Kirsty Scott reports how dire warnings of a flood of immigrants to
Britain because of EU regulations has been condemned by race relations
workers as divisive scaremongering
BY EARLY yesterday afternoon Charles Wardle's farewell vision of a
powerless Britain swamped by uncontrolled immigration had become the
latest twist in the row over Conservative divisions on Europe.
For community relations officials, however, it remained a fanciful and
xenophobic notion, and a dangerously divisive way of political
point-scoring.
As the Prime Minister promised Britain's borders would not be left
unchecked and denied his Ministers were heading every which way but
together on the European question, race relations representatives were
trying to marry Wardle's vision with the reality of immigration in the
UK and Europe.
''What he said is appalling, absolutely incredible,'' said Maggie
Chetty, senior community relations officer with Strathclyde Community
Relations Council. ''It is so far from the experience of what's
happening to people on the ground.''
Wardle's basic premise was that Britain had given away its right to
keep out a flood of legal and illegal immigrants under European
legislation. He said that the 1985 opt-out that supposedly preserved
British immigration controls was not worth the paper it was written on.
Chetty said immigration in the UK had been tightened so far in recent
years that it was virtually impossible to get in. The situation in
Europe was also very tough.
The first major tightening of immigration rules in Britain came in the
1971 Immigration Act, said Chetty. In the early 1980s further changes
were made through the Nationality and Citizenship legislation and
primary immigration was stopped. In the early 1990s visa restrictions
were brought in for countries including Nigeria, India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh. Last May, the Government announced that wealthy would-be
immigrants willing to invest in Britain would be able to bypass usual
immigration rules and apply to live in the UK for one year.
''Ordinary immigration has completely stopped in Britain,'' said
Chetty. ''The only people who can get in at all, and then not easily,
are where families are being reunited.
''The major thing about this whole row is that European immigration is
already very, very strict. It's nonsense to say that it is more liberal.
What happens in Europe is that there is very restricting migration for
guest workers who have no rights in Europe. Right across Europe the
experience of black people is that it's very difficult and terribly
restrictive.''
Chetty said it was also important to note that Britain was the only
country in the EC which has any race relations legislation.
''There is no race relations legislation in Europe that protects black
people's rights,'' she said. ''Migrant legislation which exists in
Europe doesn't allow people to put down roots and have democratic rights
like voting. Life is very, very difficult for migrants and black people
in Europe.''
She said the terminology used to describe Wardle's vision of
uncontrolled immigration might foster resentment among some Britons
already feeling the pinch from unemployment and poverty.
She said in the UK there were a plethora of cases which showed the
narrowness of existing immigration rules, including the incident last
year when the parents of a Glasgow businessman were denied leave by the
British High Commission in Pakistan to come to their granddaughter's
wedding.
The Kashmiri couple were to have attended the wedding of their first
grandchild in Renfrew. They were told the immigration officer and consul
in Islamabad did not believe they would return to Pakistan after their
visa had expired. The case caused outrage among Labour MPs.
Speaking yesterday, Labour's Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson, who has
worked with the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Council, said he was
taken aback by Wardle's statements.
''My experience, particularly for people trying to get into Britain
from the sub-continent is that it's still extremely difficult. I have
also had complaints from constituents who are black British citizens
trying to travel to France. They meet all sorts of restrictions which
are not being placed on white British citizens.
''In my experience, restrictions are already severe in terms of people
coming into this country and I am not aware that the other European
Union countries allow non-EU nationals in in significant numbers.''
Tory Euro-sceptic Bill Walker MP, however, said he believed Charles
Wardle's vision was right.
The MP for Tayside North said yesterday that if the UK's ''so-called
opt-out'' was challenged by the European Court of Justice it would
probably be found invalid.
He said he agreed with Wardle's assertion that there could then be
immigration on a huge scale.
''I believe there will be,'' he said. ''There's no way we can stop
people coming from Europe. I think it's nonsense to pretend otherwise.''
Mr Walker added that the illegal immigration position in the UK today
was ''serious''. ''If it gets worse it will become critical,'' he said.
At the Home Office, a spokeswoman said that citizens of the European
Union have free movement within the union but the government was
committed to maintaining border controls for non-EU citizens. ''They
require entry clearance in order to enter the country.''
Asked what the position would be if a non-EU citizen entered a
European community country, was given a resident visa, then tried to
move into the UK, the spokeswoman said: ''That would tend to depend on
the individual circumstances. It's too hypothetical to put in broad
terms.''
She reiterated the Prime Minister's earlier assertions that the
Government had no intention of ''dismantling the frontiers''.
Some European observers, meanwhile, say they are bemused by the row,
because the much-vaunted freedom of movement among EU nationals is not
actually taking place, and the ideal of a frontier-free,
movement-for-all Europe is still some way off.
They say the computer system to get the whole common immigration
system harmonised is still not up and running, and the External
Frontiers Convention is being held up by a row between the UK and Spain
over the inclusion of Gibraltar.
Dr David Fergus, a specialist in European Community law at Glasgow
University, said that in theory all international barriers to freedom of
movement are supposed to be down and people can move across borders.
''That patently is not happening though.''
Dr Fergus said the European community was conceived at a time of
fairly high employment in Europe and the movement of workers was a real
possibility. ''Obviously things have changed over the past 10 or 12
years. Why would you go somewhere if there was no work for you?''
In a similar vein, Mike Watson believes the entire Wardle row is also
an example of the British fondly imagining that they have the best that
Europe has to offer.
''Why should thousands of people try to come to Britain rather than
Germany, France or Holland which have higher standards of living?'' he
said.

TONY BLAIR: The Moderniser
By Jon Sopel
Michael Joseph, #15.99
WHEN Tony Blair returned from holiday last summer, a break which the
newly installed Labour leader had predictably spent contemplating what
on earth he was going to do now, he discussed with a friend the
possibility of reforming Clause 4 of the party membership. The potential
pitfalls were rehearsed for him. ''The party is not worth leading,''
said Blair, ''if it's not leading to government.'' It seemed that he had
already made up his mind.
And that, really, is what the entire political debate within the
Labour Party is now about. There has to be a limit on the years in
opposition which any political party can sustain while continuing to
retain electoral credibility and any sense of purpose. The last 16 years
have already seen off the chances of a ministerial career for an entire
generation of Labour politicians, and there is a growing desperation
among the less glamorous but more faithful ranks of the party infantry.
What could be worse, they argue, than yet another Conservative victory?
And that, of course, is why they picked Tony Blair as leader in the
first place.
So, mostly, they are gritting their teeth and getting on with the
horrid task they have been set by Blair, this leader they chose to lead
them to victory at last, and who then somewhat unexpectedly rewarded
them with a campaign to replace the totem of Clause 4 and introduce
something more relevant, more widely acceptable, more modern.
There are many people who do not like one bit what is happening. Blair
may have underestimated the amount of trouble that he is stacking up for
himself -- even if he does win this one -- but it would be hard to
diminish the determined, gritty will to win that informs what is now
under way in the Labour Party.
Tony Blair is pretty gritty on this subject himself. This much is
amply demonstrated by Jon Sopel, winner here of the race for the first
biography of he who would be the next Prime Minister. The conversation
quoted above, between Blair and his friend and adviser the Labour MP
Peter Mandelson, is itself a measure of that. The importance of it is
illustrated by the fact that although the two men obviously meet and
talk with great frequency, Mandelson felt it appropriate to take a note
and keep a record of their discussion in this case.
Sopel's book has a fair amount of decent original material of this
kind -- enough, anyway, to make it a very respectable effort. There is a
wealth of previously unknown detail about Tony Blair. It is a book which
will be of value to anyone, including members of the Labour Party, who
want to understand their leader a little bit better.
There are problems here. The most obvious is that it is quite
difficult to write a decent book about someone who hasn't actually done
anything yet. That is not to underestimate the achievement of a
successful lawyer who gets first elected to Parliament and then elected
as his own party leader within 11 years. But Tony Blair would be the
first to admit that he is untried. He himself was questioned about the
fact that he had left out of his entry in Who's Who the various
front-bench jobs he has held. ''Well, they're not real jobs, are they?''
he said.
The book is chronological. We follow the ambitious, slightly bolshie,
child through school where he was miserably unhappy at Fettes, railing
against the fagging system. He apparently now jokes that his opposition
to this and petty rules that strangled individualism were his first act
as a modernising politician.
Blair is reported to be irritated by the repeated suggestions that he
had a privileged childhood. While acknowledging that the family was
never poor or hungry, it was tried by the illness of his father and his
sister. There is, however, a naivety about his reported reactions here,
which one finds, too, in his expressed surprise about the hostility he
has engendered by sending his eldest child to a grant-maintained school.
It rather suggests a man who does not truly understand the party he
leads. He has been helped along the way by those who do: notably Gordon
Brown, the Man Most Likely To for so many years and then, suddenly, with
a terrible swiftness, the Also Ran who didn't even run. For it was Brown
who helped and guided Blair, taught him to understand the Labour Party a
little better than he previously had, and, after standing down in
Blair's favour in the leadership election, helped him to write his
memorable acceptance speech and then said, simply, but with a wry grin,
as Blair walked past him having made it: ''Nice speech''.
Brown emerges in the book as a man who knows and understands the
Labour Party in a way that Blair perhaps still doesn't and maybe never
will. In a way, however, one begins to wonder whether that is in any
case irrelevant to Tony Blair's ambition.
''The project'' about which he and his advisers talk is not just about
winning the next election, about power, about agenda-setting, or
winning-hearts-and-minds, or any other cliches; it is about redefining
the nature of British politics. It has very little to do with
understanding the Labour Party and everything to do with winning the
next election. But what will happen then? We will have to wait and find
out.

Washington, Sunday
ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation pledged today to
''negotiate promptly'' an accord on Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank and Palestinian elections, US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said.
He said in a statement the commitment was made by Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres and senior PLO official Nabil Shaath on the
fringes of an Arab-Israeli foreign ministers' meeting in Washington.
The statement, agreed after a meeting this morning between
Christopher, Peres and Shaath, said Israel and the PLO expressed
determination to work for a successful meeting later this week between
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
A meeting on Thursday between Rabin and Arafat failed to overcome
differences over Islamic guerrilla attacks on Israel and Israel's
closure of its border with Gaza and the West Bank. The differences are
holding up agreement on a troop redeployment and elections.
Foreign ministers of the United States, Israel, Egypt and Jordan and
Shaath pledged there would be no turning back in the Middle East peace
process.--Reuter.

SOOTY and Sweep have fallen foul of watchdogs for plugging their
products on their TV show.
The glove puppets were censured for allowing their commercial videos
to be clearly visible in the background of Sooty and Co.
Only one viewer complained but the Independent Television Commission
was called in to investigate the Granada TV show.
The ITC's monthly report today states: ''The videos were in breach of
the programme code about undue prominence for commercial products.
However, Sooty was spared further blushes after Granada agreed to
introduce tighter scrutiny.
''In these circumstances, the ITC concluded that it would not be
appropriate to consider any additional sanction in respect of the Sooty
programme,'' the report adds.
The ITC, created by the 1990 Broadcasting Act to regulate and license
commercial television in Britain, received 336 complaints during
January.
Football pundit Ron Atkinson caused a stir when he made an ''Irish
joke'' about stretcher bearers.
Eight viewers objected and ITV companies received other complaints
about the remark made on Champions League -- Live!
Motorcyclists were upset when Police, Camera, Action wrongly said it
was illegal for a motor cycle to tow a trailer -- 27 complaints were
upheld and a correction was screened, although Carlton TV pointed out
the law was vague.

A BLUEPRINT for the future development of the Grampian area will be
submitted by the regional council to the Scottish Secretary today, more
than two-and-a-half years late.
The Grampian Structure Plan follows a long public consultation which
involved 43 meetings attended by 2000 people and the consideration of
almost 700 letters.
Now, a further six-week consultation period will start, to allow
anyone to make their views known to the Scottish Secretary.
The biggest controversy surrounded the areas identified for the 11,000
new houses expected to be required over the next 12 years, and it has
been estimated that the delay has put around #10,000 on the price of an
average three-bedroomed semi-detached house in the Aberdeen housing
area.
The region's own officials and independent consultants backed the
creation of a new settlement to the south-west of the city (for which
there was a #500m proposal from the Stewart Milne Group) but the council
rejected that advice and eventually settled on a dispersal policy.
The regional council says the structure plan moves towards sustainable
development in the North-east and, in looking forward to the year 2006,
it embraces a ''think global: act local'' philosophy to ensure that
actions taken today do not deprive future generations of their
birthright.
''The strategy is to protect the environment while promoting the
economy, especially of rural Grampian,'' the council says.
''This is reflected in, for example, the approach to transportation,
which offers improved accessibility through a balance of public
transport and by-pass schemes.''
Councillor James Davidson, chairman of the council's economic
development and planning committee, said: ''The Grampian Structure Plan
has been some time in preparation because it is such an important
matter.
''The regional council has been wholly committed to public involvement
in the process. I hope this commitment will be reflected in supportive
comments to the Secretary of State for Scotland.''
Dr Howard Fisher, the director of economic development and planning,
said: ''I cannot pretend that the preparation and subsequent discussion
of the plan has been an easy process but it has certainly been
worthwhile.
''Sustainability is not just a new buzz word, it's essential to good
forward planning. Grampian's future is bright and an up-to-date
structure plan will be critical in delivering that future.''
Mr Lang expects to approve the plan, with or without modifications,
within a year.

At least five of his colleagues are
lining up behind veteran Ulster
Unionist leader James Molyneaux.
But, as Russell Edmonds explains,
they may be motivated more
by leadership ambitions than loyalty
BEHIND the struggle to keep Northern Ireland's peace process on the
rails, another political battle is hotting up. In both cases, it could
be said that James Molyneaux, now in his 75th year, is a key player.
On the plane from London to Belfast, he looks a somewhat insignificant
figure, his head buried in a gardening magazine as it was one evening
last week. Molyneaux is probably the most low-profile political leader
in the UK, a man who shirks media attention and is noted for his reserve
and simple tastes.
But without his support, Prime Minister John Major might not survive
and the Northern Ireland peace process could falter. Wielding such
apparent power as he does so quietly, it should come as no surprise that
several of Molyneaux's lieutenants now appear increasingly envious of
his role and restless to take over from him.
The next few weeks are likely to be the most important of his
political career as the British and Irish governments prepare to launch
their framework document with its controversial plans for new
all-Ireland institutions.
As if that were not enough, the Ulster Unionist leader faces a
personal challenge. While no-one openly opposes him, the prospects of
change at the top of the Unionist Party now looms large. Even before the
recent controversy surrounding leaks to the Times newspaper on the plans
for Ulster, Molyneaux's future was in question.
Though he has said nothing publicly, his fellow MPs at Westminster
have become convinced that he would stand down from office sometime in
1995, thus ending a political reign as leader which began in 1979. Now,
as the deadline for the British-Irish proposals nears, the pressures
grow on Molyneaux and on those who are now vying to take his place.
The prize for them is the leadership of a party which holds the
balance of power at Westminster and, thus, may determine whether the
Conservative Government remains in office for its full term. More
parochially, the Ulster Unionist Party has by far the largest support in
Northern Ireland and, without its backing, it seems no future settlement
in Ireland can be obtained.
Furthermore, if a new settlement is agreed, power will move from
London to Belfast where a Northern Ireland Assembly will be established,
in which the Unionists would be the largest block, and probably provide
the leader.
Not since the 1920s have the stakes been so high in Ireland with a
focus of attention that stretches from London, Dublin and Brussels to
the White House, where President Clinton is preparing to host a special
conference on Ulster later this year.
Molyneaux has been unassailable until recently when it emerged that
his influential relationship with John Major was turning cold. The
Unionist leader, who is a Privy Counsellor, had enjoyed the ear of Mr
Major over the past two years and, particularly, during the period when
the British Prime Minister and his Irish counterpart, Albert Reynolds,
produced the Downing Street peace declaration in December 1993.
At home in Ulster, Molyneaux's supporters believed his influence was
such that no deal could be struck between London and Dublin without his
backing. But the leaks have suggested otherwise, and Molyneaux himself
admits that he has been somewhat cold-shouldered by Downing Street in
recent weeks.
If that is the case then the ageing leader's demise could well be
hastened. He faces re-election at the annual meeting of the Ulster
Unionists' Council on March 18 and, though this is a formality, the
prospect of him deciding to bow out gracefully or of a stalking-horse
candidate emerging to challenge him cannot be ruled out.
Whatever happens, other MPs in his party are already queuing up to
take over, quietly jousting for pole position in the expectation that
this will be his last year in office.
At least five of the nine-strong Ulster Unionist group at Westminster
could be in the running. They range from the dour rural character of
William Ross, the party's chief whip, to the more outspoken John Taylor,
who still bears the facial scars from being shot by an IRA attacker in
1972 when he was a minister in the Stormont government at that time.
The leader of the Orange Order, the Rev Martin Smyth, says he will
stand if and when Molyneaux steps down, while other strong candidates
include Ken Maginnis, the party's spokesman on security, and David
Trimble, a former university law lecturer who has made a name as an
articulate performer on television.
All are Members of Parliament and, while it is not beyond the bounds
of possibility that the party could choose someone from outside
Westminster, this seems very impractical given that the political power
base remains in London, for the moment anyway.
Since none of the candidates has openly declared himself, it is
difficult to pick a favourite, but the front-runners at the moment
appear to be William Ross and John Taylor.
Ross has just celebrated his 59th birthday, he owns a farm at
Dungiven, County Londonderry, and has been an MP for the area since
1974. He appears, like Molyneaux, to be a man of few public words,
unimpressive with the media but very active behind the scenes.
Unlike some of the other candidates, he does not deviate from the
mainstream party line but was among the most sceptical about the Downing
Street peace deal and a regular critic of the Irish Government's
involvement in Northern Ireland.
In 1988 he opposed power sharing, claiming it would give Nationalists
a built-in veto, and is on record as saying that Dublin could never have
a say in the government of Northern Ireland.
John Taylor, aged 57, is the party's most high-profile MP. He has been
in Ulster politics since his university days and was the youngest
Unionist to be elected to the old Stormont Parliament. Unlike Ross, he's
rarely out of the news of the local television screens, his speeches
often addressing controversial issues and, sometimes, drawing
considerable anger from Nationalists.
In 1972 the official IRA tried to assassinate him in his home town of
Armagh. He was seriously wounded in the face and chest and had to
undergo extensive surgery, but that has not deterred him from following
a political career. At one point he angered the Irish authorities by
claiming that Loyalist violence would eventually reach Dublin, and he
has also said that, in the event of a united Ireland, he anticipates an
exodus of Protestants.
Recently Taylor said that anyone considering challenging Molyneaux
should be ''politically knee-capped'' but he is clearly one of the
leading contenders when the leader resigns.
Of the others, David Trimble is seen as a tough Unionist advocate but
may not be long enough in the party to win the top role this time. He
qualified as a barrister and later became a senior lecturer in law and
Dean of the Faculty at Queen's University in Belfast, before becoming MP
for Upper Bann in 1990.
Aged 50, Trimble has been heavily critical of the Irish Government's
links with the peace process and their attempts to persuade the IRA with
what he sees as unacceptable political concessions. He is on record as
saying that it was wrong to be ''publicly negotiating with terrorists''.
Ken Maginnis, 56, the MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, is a former
teacher and speaks on security matters for the Ulster Unionists. The
Enniskillen Remembrance Day bombing took place in his constituency and
he is noted for his strong opposition to terrorism.
He was critical of President Clinton's decision to issue a visa to the
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and appeared on television in the US in a
debate with Adams. He has been demanding that the IRA hand over its
weapons before Sinn Fein can be involved in political talks.
Finally, the Rev Martin Smyth, Grand Master of the Orange Order in
Ireland, was originally a Presbyterian minister. He resigned his church
ministry to become MP for South Belfast in 1982 in a by-election caused
by the assassination of the Rev Robert Bradford.
Smyth would have enormous support from within the Orange Order, which
he leads during the summer months in a number of major parades and
demonstrations. However, the Unionist Party is attempting to shed any
sectarian image and it may be that the appointment of such a
high-profile Orange leader would not be acceptable in some quarters.
Aged 64, Smyth is seen as another traditionalist, a factor in his
favour among the grassroots Unionists who will be called on to choose a
new leader.
At the moment Ross appears the favourite even if the prospect of
having him as leader finds little enthusiasm in either Dublin or London.
But whoever is chosen is hardly likely to deviate from the position
adopted by Molyneaux over so many years.
From the speeches and profiles of the main contenders for his job, it
is evident that none of them is likely to break the solid political
mould of Ulster Unionism, which James Molyneaux has set firmly since
1979.

EDUCATION policy should not be driven by the whims of accountants or
market forces, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland told an audience of academics in Aberdeen yesterday.
The Rt Rev Dr James Simpson was speaking at the Founder's Day sermon
at a ceremony to mark the 500th anniversary of Aberdeen University.
He said: ''When accountants and economists often have more power to
determine what happens in universities than principals or professors, I
hope this university and the other Scottish universities will go on
resisting the pressure to justify everything that is taught and done
here solely by the standard of market values.''
The massive expansion of universities over the past decade, with
thousands more students being taught by fewer and fewer lecturers, has
resulted in a consequent decrease in the quality and depth of the
educational experience for many, he warned.
This meant that staff had less time to meet and debate with colleagues
or their students, which has a negative effect on the quality of their
research.
''The resultant loss is considerable, for it is through sharing ideas
and the clash of thought that understanding is enlarged, scrutinised,
and modified,'' Dr Simpson said.
One of the problems of the market force-dominated approach to
education, Dr Simpson said, was that it was attuned only to the bare
statistics of increasing the number of graduates, and did not consider
the often more important role of education in helping young people
develop into responsible members of society.
Ignoring this responsibility means that our universities can be
turning out extremely well qualified individuals -- ''walking
encyclopaedias'' with a string of degrees -- who appear ''to act and
talk like fools''.
''It takes more than knowledge and skills to make people wise,'' Dr
Simpson said. His concern was that universities were being forced to
ditch moral education, in favour of a conveyor-belt, soulless approach,
making them little more than degree-factories, in ''a culture of
contempt'' where market forces dominate virtually every sphere of life.
Education should be a process of equipping students to make a life for
themselves that was ''satisfying and worthwhile'', with the highest
ambition not the pursuit of money and an affluent lifestyle but the
enrichment of all of ''the great human family'', with the ultimate aim
greater justice for all.
The moderator's implicit attack on the Government's education policy
came just days after university chiefs warned that more funding would
have to be provided if the proposed expansion of the number of
university students were to be achieved without adversely affecting the
quality of education on offer.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals also criticised the
Government's emphasis on competition and assessing performance in terms
of bald statistics.
The Government and the universities have set a target to get 40% of
school-leavers going on to further education by the end of the decade.
At present, 30% go on to higher education, although the proportion is
higher in Scotland.

Meanwhile, Labour's Scottish employment spokesman claimed that his
party's plans to introduce a national minimum wage would not lead to job
losses, writes CAMERON SIMPSON.
Mr John McFall told a seminar on employment rights in Glasgow that
there was no credible research to substantiate the wild claims by
Government Ministers that a minimum wage would lead to job losses.
He said: ''The wide variations in the claims about possible job losses
by senior Tories shows that they don't know what they are talking about.
''Norman Tebbit estimates that a minimum wage would cost 60,000 jobs,
while David Hunt goes over the top, claiming that it could be more than
two million. Anyone who takes a hard look at the facts and the research
that has been done can only conclude that the Tory arguments are
entirely bogus.''
Mr McFall said a recent US study of 440 fast-food outlets in New
Jersey had shown that after the national minimum wage had gone up there
had been a net increase in employment, due in part to the resulting
extra spending power.
Despite a dramatic slump in wage levels in the hotel and catering
trade in the UK following abolition of the Wages Council in 1993, about
27,000 jobs had been lost in that sector.
Mr McFall told the seminar that a minimum national wage was necessary
to ensure an end to poverty in work and to prevent unscrupulous
employers from exploiting a vulnerable workforce.
In industries such as hairdressing, hotel and catering, retail, and
the leisure industries, at least 25% of the workers were being paid less
than they would have been if the wages councils had still been in
operation.
In the hotel and catering trade, 66% are being paid less than they
would otherwise have been if wages councils had still been on the go.
In all, 31% of the UK workforce -- around 840,000 people -- are in
what is considered to be low-paid work.
Mr McFall went on: ''It is clear that many employers in these sectors
simply aren't uprating their pay levels from one year to the next. It is
a staggering fact that 40.9% of families on family credit were within
the wage council orbit.''
Mr McFall also told the seminar that the Tories were at their most
callous when dealing with young people. The cumulative effect of the
abolition of minimum wage protection for the under-21s, the lower level
of income support for younger people, and the withdrawal of income
support for 16 and 17-year-olds, had been a drop in average income since
1979 for those under 20 of #34 a week.
* The Government's insistence that its policies have increased the
number of jobs was attacked as ''misleading and inaccurate'' in a new
report from the TUC yesterday.

SIGNS that the troubled Loch Lomond steamer Maid of the Loch faces
another financial storm emerged yesterday.
Dumbarton District Council is this week due to establish a trust fund
in an effort to save the Maid, which has been tied up at Balloch pier
for 14 years.
However, a report issued by Mr Michael Watters, district secretary,
the council's chief executive, indicates a reluctance on the part of the
local authority to transfer the ship to the trust immediately.
It is also reluctant to hand over the pier and a parcel of valuable
land, which were purchased along with the Maid and her sister ship, the
Countess Fiona.
''It has been proposed that the ownership of the Maid will not be
transferred until the trust has been successful in attracting the
critical mass funding which will indicate the likely success of the
trust and its purposes,'' Mr Watters says.
However, the council indicates it may be willing to lease it to the
Paddle Steamer Preservation Society, which has already kitted out the
Maid in its livery.
The society feels that without the immediate transfer of ownership
''the trust's ability to attract funding will be severely prejudiced''.
Its members want the steamer handed over as soon as the trust is
established, with the condition that should it fail to attract the
necessary cash to save it within six months to a year then the ownership
will revert to the council.
Mr Watters says he is attempting to clarify the position before the
council meets to appoint the five members of the trust on Thursday.
They are likely to be Provost Patrick O'Neill and two council
officials, Mr Michael Hugan, of the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society,
and Councillor Billy Petrie, chairman of Argyll, Loch Lomond, Stirling,
and Trossachs Tourist Board.
It will be their job to set up operating companies to restore the Maid
to one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions.
However, Mr Watters says only #75,000 has been suggested as the
council's initial contribution, although the feasibility study assumed
they would give three times that amount.
The same report also stated it would cost more than #1m to get the
steamer sailing.
Mr Watters -- says he will be contacting Dunbartonshire Enterprise to
clarify their commitment.
His report follows rumblings that enthusiasm to save the Maid is
waning.
Mr Donald MacInnes, chief executive of Dunbartonshire Enterprise, says
that although they are currently looking for a ''flagship project'' for
tourism on Loch Lomondside, the Maid may not be it.
The LEC has come under pressure from cruise operators to abandon the
Maid project because they believe it will scuttle their business.

<HEADLINE>Union attacks Peterken plan to axe 500 jobs</HEADLINE>

AN ACCUSATION of ''ideological vandalism'' was yesterday levelled at
Mr Laurence Peterken, the dismissed general manager of Greater Glasgow
Health Board, over his recommendation that more than 500 jobs should be
axed in two divisions of the Common Services Agency.
It came from Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer with Unison, the
public service union.
Mr Peterken, now director of special projects of the CSA, where he is
carrying out a review of its services, has suggested in an internal
document that the two divisions be closed.
These control payments for dental treatment and prescription charges
and monitor the quality of services provided by dentists and pharmacists
in Scotland for the NHS.
Shutting them would mean 520 job losses in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and
Aberdeen.
Mr Devine said the union was appalled by the proposal, which showed
there was a piecemeal attack on the CSA and ''step-by-step
asset-stripping''.
Referring to 200 jobs already lost since Mr Peterken began his review
in November, 1993, Mr Devine said nearly 40% of the staff in CSA had
been made redundant, and that keeping these jobs would save taxpayers in
Scotland #26m a year.
Mr Devine yesterday took part in a meeting in Edinburgh between Unison
and the CSA about an earlier proposal by Mr Peterken to earmark 37 jobs
for redundancy in its supplies division. It was adjourned until
Thursday.
Mr Matt Smith, Scottish secretary of Unison, said yesterday that Mr
Peterken had caused nothing but problems for employees.
However, an internal management memorandum in CSA has expressed doubt
about Mr Peterken's latest proposal.
It suggests that an alternative would be to review procedures and try
to identify where savings could be made, and that this would be
preferable to the division disappearing and its functions being
performed elsewhere in the UK.
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday that Mr Peterken's report
was an internal document and he could not comment on its contents.
The recommendations were only suggestions and would not necessarily be
acted upon. The final decision would be taken by the CSA board.
Mr Peterken was appointed to his post in the health service within a
fortnight of being sacked from the health board.
His departure followed a serious of bitter exchanges with Mr Bill
Fyfe, chairman of GGHB. Mr Fyfe was in turn forced to resign after a
political row over the way he had handled Mr Peterken's dismissal.

AN exhibition opens today at the Albert Hall, in McManus Galleries,

A FIFTY-FOOT trawler was hauled to safety off the Isle of Skye at the
weekend after her steering gear failed and she was drifting towards
rocks, two miles from the shore in Loch Dunvegan. The Girl Anne, owned
by Charlie Macleod, of Kyle of Lochalsh, called for help after 8pm on
Saturday night. A clam dredger, the Kelly, came to her rescue, towing
the stricken boat to Uig for repairs. The Girl Anne returned to sea
yesterday.

FOUR brothers have become the first this century and possibly in
history to be installed as Freemen of Berwick at the same ceremony in
Berwick Town Hall. Mr Carl McQueen, 30, of Cullercoats, Tyne and Wear;
his brothers Stewart, 28, of Ovingham, Northumberland; Neil, 24, of
Crawcrook, County Durham, and Neil's twin, David, also from Ovingham, on
Saturday claimed their hereditary right to be made free under a
390-year-old Royal Charter, as sons of a Freeman. The family link with
the Freedom dates back to 1784 and the brothers are the eighth
generation to claim their birthright.

A NUCLEAR reactor at Hunterston Power Station, Ayrshire, was twice
shut down after on-load refuelling, ScottishPower has reported. The two
incidents within 24 hours last month both led to automatic shutdown of
Reactor 3.
The first incident, on January 9, happened as power was being
increased after six channels had been refuelled. A control rod fault
triggered a shutdown. The next day, the main boiler feed pump developed
a fault as the reactor was again being powered up, and the automatic
shutdown system came into operation.

William Russell talks to Ted Short who says Tony Blair need look no
further than the filing cabinet for a Scottish Assembly scheme
TONY BLAIR should appoint a Cabinet minister from the Commons, not
necessarily a Scot, whose sole job would be to get the Devolution Bill
through Parliament, acording to Lord Glenamara, who, as Ted Short was
the architect of the Wilson Government's Devolution Bill.
He retired from the Commons in 1976, when Wilson resigned as Prime
Minister. He was succeeded as Lord President by Michael Foot.
John Smith, then a Minister of State, was Foot's No 2, and did the
remaining detailed work on the legislation. Lord Glenamara does not
believe a similar arrangement would work again. He is also sceptical
about Labour's none-too-specific plans for the English regions.
Things have changed since 1974 when, despite a commitment, Labour had
no idea what it was going to do. ''I started from scratch,'' he said.
''Harold Wilson called me in one day and said he would like me to take
charge. I asked where had we got to? We had got nowhere. No work had
been done.
''I agreed with Wilson that the Government would start from the
position that we would be as generous as possible. We were clear what we
meant. We would devolve certain powers of central government to a
regional government, which is quite different from handing over
sovereignty. In the case of devolution you can always take back or
modify. The example is Stormont.
''We decided in the case of Scotland, as it was already making its own
laws at Westminster and had it own legal system, that clearly the right
thing to do was to devolve power to make laws. In the case of Wales it
was to be executive devolution.''
He added: ''It was a massive operation. The whole field of Government
had to be reviewed and the consequences considered. In my time in
Government I have never known any operation to be more carefully
supervised.''
He said that a Blair Government would have the legislation he and
Michael Foot worked on as a basis from which to start, which meant it
would be in a better state than Labour was in 1974.
On the vexed West Lothian Question, which is bound to be raised once
again, he suggested one look at the Stormont example. ''Did you ever
remember anyone saying that the Irish MPs should not vote on English
matters here? It worked in that case and there is no reason why it
should not work in the case of Scotland.''
Should Scotland's number of Westminster MPs be reduced? ''I don't
think so,'' he said. ''Scotland's population is so dispersed you need
that number.''
He pointed out that English MPs voted on Scottish matters as it was,
and it would be possible to ensure that purely English legislation went
to committees on which only English MPs sat for their detailed
examination.
''Devolution works perfectly well in Germany, in Australia and New
Zealand and Canada,'' he added. ''We can look at their experience. We
did. I don't think devolution will lead to the break up of the United
Kingdom.''
His advice to those who will be following the path he went down in
1974-76 is to know their stuff. ''It will be difficult and take a long
time to get through the Commons. I don't know about the Lords.''
He said that he and the Labour Party diverged over the issue of the
North of England whose MPs last time round played such a major part in
impeding the devolution process. It was largely because of that response
the party had gone for a system of local government in England, he said.
He did not think there was any need for regional bodies in England.
Nor was there any demand for them, except from politicians. ''I
recommend anyone who gets the devolution job to resist other jobs. It
should be a full-time task for one minister.
''When the devolved Parliament meets in Edinburgh I will be there,''
he added. ''I feel the Scottish identity should be given a dimension of
its own through a devolved government. I am sure it will work well,
strengthen the United Kingdom, and not be divisive.''

John Linklater argues that 50 years after the devastation of Dresden,
Britain should end the long deception and admit that the city's
destruction was more a show of power than a strategic imperative.
DRESDEN must be seen as a demonstration of the destructive
capabilities of the Western Allies in anticipation of the Cold War.
Until this political motive is addressed and understood, the levelling
of Dresden 50 years ago today remains an even more senseless act.
Attempts to justify the operation in terms of strategic necessity, aimed
at accelerating victory in the Second World War, are obdurately naive
and a lasting insult.
Historians are at least agreed that there was a conspicuous failure to
meet the ostensible objectives of successive waves of attack by Bomber
Command and the US 8th Air Force. Dresden's main bridges remained
standing, trains resumed running within a couple of days and priority
was given to clearing streets of moonscape rubble. The first pictures of
the disaster area show how quickly this was achieved.
Troop concentrations, if they existed at all, were composed of
children and veterans. I met a Dresden survivor last week who told me
that at the time of the bombings his father, aged 60, had been drafted
into air defences in another part of Saxony. The criminal liquidation of
thousands of innocent refugees (the highest element of the death toll)
cannot be dignified with any discussion of strategic objectives. The
objective of sowing confusion implies that a city which had taken in
refugees to double its population to more than one million was not
already in a state of considerable disarray. This is patent nonsense.
The Press Association reported within days that Dresden was the start
of a new campaign of ''terror bombing'' designed to break the morale of
the German people, and it caused tremendous political embarrassment when
it escaped the American censor. It was suppressed in Britain, where
questions in the House of Commons and public criticism made Dresden a
delicate issue from the outset.
Suggesting the German civil population needed Dresden to awaken to
''terror'', when the British and American armies were at the Rhine and
the Soviets at the Oder, when every industrial city had received five
years of sustained pummeling, is analogous to speculation that the
war-scarred populations of Coventry and Clydebank would have collapsed
and surrendered with the subsequent news that Stratford-upon-Avon had
been fire-bombed. Such an ineptitude would have produced incredulity,
indignation and a stiffening of resolve. Dresden had that effect. Berlin
would be fought for street by street.
It also lost the Allies the moral ascendancy in a fight to crush an
evil, offering a permanent excuse for the kind of resentment and
national humiliation that had started the war in the first place. The
Neo-Nazi threat to today's memorial in Dresden is a case in point, and
it is four years since the Neo-Nazis had any kind of profile in Dresden.
It is exploiting an opportunity created by Britain's continuing
inability to express regret. The RAF have boycotted today's ceremonies,
refusing to contribute to reconciliation.
Churchill's memorandum of March 28, 1945, when he called for a review
of the policy of bombing German cities, ''simply for the sake of
increasing terror, though under other pretexts'', is generally presented
as a betrayal of Bomber Command. Its commander-in-chief, Arthur Harris,
responded typically the next day that any psychiatrist could explain
sensitivity over Dresen: ''It is connected with German bands and Dresden
shepherdesses . . . I do not personally regard the whole of the
remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British
Grenadier.'' In the face of such an embarrassing display of
vindictiveness, Churchill's missive can be taken as a belated
confession, although it still fails to tell the whole truth.
Dresden was intended to make an impression, that much is clear. It was
one of the deepest strikes made on a European city during the course of
the war. The co-ordination of British and American bombers, in waves of
nightime and daytime strikes from February 13-15, was a rare occasion in
the war when co-operation between Bomber Command and the US Air force
actually materialised.
The elaborate decoys and dummy runs planned into the attacks were
exhibitionist and out of all proportion to the level of air defence with
which Germany was capable of resisting in February 1945. Dresden was a
virgin target, so the extent of the devastation from a single operation
could be measured all the more awesomely. As an opportunity to kill a
lot of people refugee-saturated Dresden was an optimum. As a spectacle
of conflagration, it had been learned through experience that old cities
ignite most readily.
The question is, for whose education was such a stupefying prodigy of
destruction intended? On the first two days alone, 1084 British and
American planes dropped 3371 tons of bombs and incendiaries to create a
firestorm. There is a kind of mentality that will find such statistics
impressive. Stalin had asked for support on the Eastern Front. Now he
got a demonstration, and a salutary lesson. Dresden was all about giving
Stalin food for thought.
It is reported that only a week before, at the Yalta Conference,
American and British chiefs of staff were chagrined by Stalin's apparent
ignorance of the damage done to Germany and Japan by strategic bombing.
Hollywood pictures and combat footage were apparently screened to make a
point that Dresden would graphically reinforce when the Soviet Red Army
moved on another 50 miles to take the city.
More significantly, it was at Yalta that the lines for the impending
Cold War were drawn up as Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin divided the
map of East and West Europe. Dresden came precisely two days after the
conference broke up. Churchill had initiated plans for the attack in
late January.
The ''pretext'', to repeat Churchill's own word a month later, was to
support the advance of the Soviet Red Army. The hidden political
objective was intimidation, of Stalin more than the defeated German
people. If Germany was not effectively defeated, as the defenders of the
Dresden operation claim, then why did the Yalta Conference concern
itself with such issues as minimum subsistence for German civilians,
dismantling of German armaments production, reparations out of the
German people's post-war earnings and the setting up of international
courts for trials of war criminals?
Dresden was a British and American war crime because thousands of
innocent lives and a beautiful city were sacrificed to teach a salutary
lesson to the Soviets. Only the generous would ascribe deterrence value
in the coming Cold War, a demonstration of conventional warfare taken to
the extreme. It was part of an escalation of destruction the human
imagination would sanction, a preparatory to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and
their sickening illustration of nuclear capability.
Dresden belongs to a New Europe. The politics that wasted that city
are an ugly anachronism, and it is time that Britain stopped lying about
its shameful role in a 50-year deception, justified by cant and
hypocrisy.

Health and poverty in Glasgow come under the spotlight tonight when
the BBC's Panorama programme examines increasing death rates among the
poor in Britain.
Dr Harry Burns, director of public health for Greater Glasgow Health
Board, explains why the problems must be faced and why he believes
Government policies are making matters worse.
DIRECTORS of public health are not employed to win popularity
contests. If the health of the population is not as good as it should be
then it is our job to ask awkward questions. We poke around in the
system, often making people feel threatened and uncomfortable. In many
respects we are similar to -- and as popular as -- policemen and
journalists. The participation of Glasgow public health doctors in
tonight's Panorama may make us even more unpopular. By discussing
Glasgow's depressing health statistics with London-based journalists,
Glasgow's imagemakers will see us as causing damage.
In attributing the cause of ill health to poverty, Government will see
us as being critical of policies which do not concern us. Too bad. My
job description says I am employed to ''determine and interpret the
health status of the population and the factors which have a bearing on
it''. So here are some determinations and interpretations.
Young people living in poor areas of Glasgow are two-and-a-half times
more likely to die before the age of 65 as those living in affluent
areas. If you live in Drumchapel or Easterhouse or Pollok you are twice
as likely to have a stroke or a heart attack as someone living in
Bearsden or Newton Mearns. You are three times as likely to develop lung
cancer. A new-born baby leaving hospital today to go home to Drumchapel
might expect to die around seven to 10 years sooner than the baby in the
next cot who is going home to Bearsden.
The stark facts of Glasgow's burden of ill health and its relation to
poverty is well known. However, poverty influences health in more
pervasive ways which are less widely appreciated. More than half of all
women who live in an affluent area and develop breast cancer will
survive.
Despite receiving identical treatment, more than half of all women
with breast cancer living in poor areas will die. If you live in a poor
area and require a bowel operation, your chances of developing
complications and dying after the operation are at least 50% higher than
if you lived in an affluent area. If you develop angina you are less
likely to be referred for a heart operation. You are three times as
likely to be admitted to hospital with a broken leg and four times as
likely to be admitted with a psychiatric illness. The incidence of
disease is greater and ability to benefit from treatment is less among
the poor.
Similar differences in health status have been described in England,
Canada, the United States and in most European countries. The only
feature peculiar to Glasgow is the extreme nature of the inequality. The
relationship between poverty and ill health is striking and consistent
for most major causes of death and in most societies.
Furthermore, it has been known about for many years. So, why the fuss
now? Are not the poor always with us? In all societies some are better
off than others. If some people are feckless and smoke, eat unhealthy
food and drink to excess, what can be done about it? Well, quite a lot,
actually.
People differ in their understanding of the extent to which they can
control their own health. A well-paid professional, used to taking
significant decisions in his daily life, is more likely to believe he
has the ability to influence his own health. An unemployed labourer with
no prospects of ever improving the material well-being of his family and
having to live on handouts believes himself to be at the mercy of
external forces.
Sociologists call this ''having an external locus of control''. He is
less likely to give up smoking because he does not see the point. There
is little he can do to influence his life. This effect was illustrated
during recent broadcasts to commemorate the liberation of Auschwitz. One
survivor said: ''We brushed our teeth, even when the brush had no
bristles. We combed our hair even when the comb had no teeth. We would
not let them take away our dignity.'' That gentleman's survival may have
been helped by a strong internal locus of control.
A society which wishes to generate health has to develop this sense of
control and self-reliance within its members. If we consign families to
live in inadequate housing, fail to educate and train them and give them
no hope of ever having meaningful employment we will also burden them
with ill health.
Poverty undermines one's sense of control. Lack of control over one's
own life leads to stress. Stress causes a wide range of physical
illnesses. The association between poverty and physical ill health can
be explained by sound science. However, in affluent countries it is not
the absolute but the relative level of income which determines health.
For example, per capita income in the United States is higher than that
of Sweden yet life expectancy is greater in Sweden where income is more
evenly distributed. In the 1960s and 70s the share of total wealth which
Japanese society paid to the poor increased at a faster rate than in any
other developed country. In the course of those two decades, average
Japanese life expectancy increased by about seven years.
Countries which have sought to distribute income evenly across society
through taxation policies have a higher life expectancy than those which
have not. Available research leads one to conclude that profound
improvements in health across all sections of society can be achieved by
narrowing inequalities in income. Yet the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
have just issued a report confirming that the opposite is happening in
Britain.
A universally acceptable way of increasing disposable income in
Glasgow's deprived areas must be the provision of jobs. When peripheral
housing schemes were built in the 1950s it was assumed that employment
would still be available in traditional heavy industries. As shipyards,
engineering and manufacturing industries in Glasgow have died, attempts
to replace those jobs have not been nearly successful enough.
There appears to be a view in Scottish Enterprise that cities are for
service jobs. Manufacturing is done outside cities in the new towns.
Between 1981 and 1991 Glasgow lost 40% of its manufacturing jobs while
increasing its service sector by around 2%. East Kilbride increased its
manufacturing workforce by 20% and its service jobs by over 40%.
Manufacturing jobs drag service jobs with them so Glasgow faces a double
whammy.
There is rather a different view in Cardiff. Major Japanese electrical
companies have been persuaded to build factories in the city. It is
noticeable that inward investment in Scotland always seems to end up in
new towns.
The Scottish Office document on urban regeneration areas -- Progress
in Partnership -- is interesting. It advocates that ''the main route to
increased employment is to improve links to economic development outwith
regeneration areas, and the creation of employment within the areas is a
secondary objective.'' But Glasgow has the lowest level of car ownership
of any local authority in Britain and have you ever tried to get a bus
from Easterhouse to Livingston?
Unless policy is changed to ensure that jobs are created in places
accessible to the unemployed, the cycle of poverty, stress and ill
health will not be broken in this city. People will leave or die.
Planners and policy makers seem wedded to economic theory which, I
believe, is destroying lives.
Recently there have been calls for an independent inquiry into
Glasgow's health. It would show that the health service deals
effectively with the avalanche of illness confronting it. An inquiry
would also show how policy makers -- of all political shades -- have
failed to understand the destructive effects that flawed education,
employment, transport and housing policies have on health. Reminding
policy makers and politicians of all parties of the human consequences
of their policies will not make me popular. But then, winning popularity
contests is not in my job description.

BRITAIN'S social cohesion is under threat, Labour warned yesterday
after a leaked Civil Service report blamed Government policies for the
growth of an urban underclass.
The paper, which has been circulated in Whitehall, highlights fears
that ''islands'' of poverty, social division, and alienation are being
created, according to a Sunday newspaper.
The document was drawn up following a meeting of eight departmental
permanent secretaries summoned by Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler to
raise awareness of social problems.
It comes after the Government last week rejected claims of widening
inequality made in a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
The paper states: ''It was clearly not arguable that the number of
poor people were increasing, even if it was not certain that, in
absolute terms, the poor were getting poorer.''
The most worrying element was long-term unemployment.
The paper said there had been frequent ''trade-offs'' between policies
aimed at widening choice in health care, education, and housing and
policies aimed at helping the most deprived.
Generally, the policies to increase choice worked to the benefit of
the better-off who were best placed to take advantage of them.
Among the policies highlighted by the report as contributing to the
problems was the distribution of cash incentives to encourage better-off
tenants to leave poorer council estates which was creating inner city
ghettos.
Bus deregulation was blamed for leading to the withdrawal of services
from poorer areas, making it more difficult for people there to travel
to work.
The paper also said education policies discouraged schools from
targeting disaffected pupils for special help, while the growth of
housing benefits following the reduced subsidy of rents for ''social
housing'' was leading to an increase in benefit dependency.
The reduction in value of the married couple's allowance and enhanced
social security payments for single parents were leading to a growth in
the number of unmarried mothers while acting as a disincentive to
unemployed fathers to live under the same roof as their families.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar had no doubt where the
blame lay. ''I'm quite clearly pointing the finger at Government
policy,'' he said on GMTV's Sunday Programme.
''I think that if present trends ran on unchecked, at some date in the
not too distant future, we would have a divided Britain, so seriously
and bitterly divided that it would, in fact, threaten social cohesion.''
He did not think there was any imminent danger of rioting in the
streets.
''But what I do believe is that, if we go on down this road, then
we're going to have an awful lot of people who are going to be shut out
altogether from any increase in national prosperity or national
opportunity.''

STRATHCLYDE Police now believe that a three-year-old girl taken from
an Argyll hotel last week by her mother is out of the country. The
child's father has legal custody.
Officials at ports and airports across the UK were put on alert by
police on Friday, the day after Mrs Karen Stewart left the Crinan Hotel
with her daughter, Kelly. Mrs Stewart is from New Zealand.
A police spokeswoman said yesterday that a woman airline official in
Glasgow had reported selling tickets to a woman and a child for a flight
to Amsterdam on Thursday.
The airline official alerted police after reading about Mrs Stewart
and Kelly in a newspaper on Saturday.
The police spokeswoman said detectives from Campbeltown were checking
with Dutch authorities to see if the pair had arrived in Amsterdam, and
on their possible movements since then.
It is likely that Interpol will be asked to help in the inquiry.
Detectives feel that Mrs Stewart may be heading for her parents' home in
New Zealand.
The girl's father, Mr Andrew Stewart, of Bellanoch, near Lochgilphead,
had been granted custody of Kelly after the couple separated last year.
He left the child with her mother earlier on Thursday but they had
gone when he went to collect her.
Mr Stewart, 29, a woodcutter, was granted an interim custody order at
Dunoon Sheriff Court on Wednesday, which prevented Mrs Stewart, 34,
taking Kelly out of his care, or out of the sheriffdom of North
Strathclyde.
He said his estranged wife had packed her cases and left her job at
the hotel, where she had worked as a receptionist for the past month.
Mr Stewart said yesterday: ''I am gutted that my estranged wife has
been foolish enough to defy the court order. While I don't think she
will harm Kelly, my concerns will remain until I know she is safe.''
He said CID officers had asked him for the address of his estranged
wife's parents, who live in Mount Maunganui, on New Zealand's North
Island.

<HEADLINE>Mayhew calls for 'give and take' over Ulster</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE can be no political settlement in Ulster without ''give and
take'', Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, insisted
yesterday as he addressed the pro-Unionist Young Conservative conference
in Southport, Merseyside.
His comments followed a warning by former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit
that the ''shadow of hooded killers'' would hang over any referendum on
the future of Northern Ireland while the IRA refused to give up its
arms.
However, in an apparent bid to calm heightened Unionist fears about
the future of Ulster, Sir Patrick said: ''We shall not propose ideas,
all of which meet the ambitions of one tradition and none of which will
be welcome to the other.
''That would result in more, not less conflict. That, too, is nowadays
widely accepted in Northern Ireland. There can be no settlement without
some give and take.''
Alluding to the politically explosive leak of a late draft of the
Anglo-Irish framework document on the future of Northern Ireland, Sir
Patrick said: ''A recent disruptive event has been received in the
province with anxiety, no doubt, but with admirable calm and balance.''
He stressed that the joint framework document would contain ''ideas''
and was not a blueprint but ''something for the parties to consult
about, not something to impose''.
London and Dublin were not there yet, he said, but should be able to
succeed before long.
His speech came less than 24 hours after Lord Tebbit, injured in the
IRA Brighton bombing, was loudly applauded when he attacked the
Government for keeping the Unionists ''in the dark and uninvolved'' in
the development of the framework document.
Lord Tebbit said Mr Major had promised the people of Northern Ireland
the last word about their future, in a referendum.
''But if the IRA remains in being as a military terrorist
organisation, still holding on to its guns and bombs, then that
referendum would be conducted with those guns at the back of the head of
the people of Northern Ireland,'' he said.
''If you vote no to the new constitution, they will be told, then you
will be voting for a renewal of the killing.
''In those circumstances, the referendum would be held under duress --
in the shadow of the armed and hooded killers.''
''It would be a dishonourable process and, whatever the result, would
lead only to renewed violence.''
Shortly before Lord Tebbit's speech, national chairman of the Young
Conservatives, Mr Adrian Lee, emphasised the Tory party youth wing's
commitment to the people of Northern Ireland, saying Young Tories would
''go to the wall'' for the union.
Mr Lee was cheered when he said it was a ''great shame'' that the
Unionist community felt totally excluded from negotiations between
London and Dublin, when Unionists had given the Government such sterling
support in the Commons.
Sir Patrick -- in a speech interpreted as a clear appeal to Unionists
not to wreck the peace process -- attempted to assuage fears by telling
Young Tories: ''We cherish the union.''
He said the union was supported by a very large numerical majority in
Northern Ireland and he had been told that 70% of Catholics there were
in no hurry to join a united Ireland.
Departing from his prepared text, Sir Patrick said: ''With the
progression of peace, people in nationalist areas are more and more
turning to the RUC as a working police force with normal duties.
''I think in turn they would give the RUC a lot of help if violence
were to return.
''If anyone tried violence again, I think they would be seen off by
the public.''

VETERANS of the fight against Saddam Hussein who claim to be suffering
from Gulf War syndrome yesterday welcomed the creation of two new groups
which, they believe, will help convince a sceptical Ministry of Defence
that the sickness exists.
Researchers established the Gulf Syndrome Study Group this weekend to
gather information about the sickness.
Meanwhile, Ms Hilary Jones, 44, a former major who served with Army
nursing staff in the Gulf, has been given a place on the Gulf Welfare
Group, set up this month to act on behalf of people like herself who
believe they are suffering from the illness.
Mr Eddie Blench, co-chairman of the Gulf Veterans Association, said:
''These are important steps forward for us.''
Mr Blench, 33, who has suffered eyesight problems, energy loss,
blisters, and mood swings since serving as a lance-corporal in the First
Armoured Division HQ and Signal Regiment in the Gulf War, said the main
problem was the MoD's disbelieving attitude.
''I was just a corporal in the army so the MoD wouldn't take much
notice of me,'' he said. ''The members of these groups are powerful
people who will be listened to.''
He said the group's members included Tory MP Edwina Currie; Colonel
Terry English, the Royal British Legion's controller of welfare; and
Colonel Simon Brewis of the Army Benevolent Fund.
The Gulf Syndrome Study Group has been set up by a 20-year-old working
party of independent scientists and doctors concerned with the effects
of chemical and biological weapons.
''We are all well versed in what these weapons can do,'' said group
administrator Elizabeth Sigmund. ''We don't know what causes this Gulf
War syndrome yet, although we know a lot of factors that may be
involved.''
The group said it already had evidence that warnings from drug
manufacturers against giving some innoculations at the same time as
others, and about after-effects of anti-nerve gas pills, had been
ignored.

A SAMPLE of people who used legal services in Scotland during one year
showed that 91% were satisfied with the help they received, according to
a survey published today.
The Scottish Office survey, the result of research based on interviews
with nearly 4500 households showed that 85% of people would return to
the same adviser.
Only 8% of people said that they had, at some time, felt really
annoyed with the way their legal adviser dealt with the case and
two-thirds of them felt like making an official complaint.
Only 13% of those who had used legal services had been told by their
adviser of the complaints procedure.

and was in a stable condition. Police said the car was a white Vauxhall
Cavalier and appealed for witnesses to the collision.
Two hours earlier, Mr John Cuthbert, 57, of Fulshaw Crescent, Ayr,
received a serious head injury when he was hit by a car as he crossed
the town's Main Road. He was taken to Southern General hospital,
Glasgow, where he was said to be serious but stable.

<TEXT>
SOCCER star Eric Cantona was at the centre of new controversy
yesterday after allegedly being involved in another kung-fu style attack
similar to the trouble at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Ground in south
London last month.
The Manchester United player, holidaying on Guadaloupe in the West
Indies after his outburst involving a Palace fan, is accused of becoming
involved in a fracas with a TV crew.
ITN said its crew went to the Caribbean island to ask the French star
when he is to return to England.
It said the three-man team -- reporter Terry Lloyd, cameraman Mike
Inglis, and soundman Mark Lyons -- politely approached Cantona on a
public beach at Guadaloupe.
Mr Lloyd told ITN News that Cantona ignored all their questions.
''He then grabbed me in a headlock and said 'come with me I'd like a
chat with you'.''
Cantona let Mr Lloyd go and walked over to the other crew members,
suggesting they should go ''somewhere quiet''.
''Suddenly, without warning, he came running at me, launched into the
air, and kicked me in the chest,'' said Mr Lloyd.
Mr Lloyd said that while he was down on the sand, Cantona stood over
him and said: ''I'm going to kill you.''
The TV crew called the police, who ordered them to hand over the film
to them, saying they would give it to Cantona.
ITN foreign news desk assistant Tony Fisher said the camera team
stopped filming and helped to get Mr Lloyd released from the player's
grip after he imposed the headlock.
''Then Cantona came running back and went into a flying kung-fu style
kick and kicked Terry in the chest,'' he added.
He said Mr Lloyd had not seen a doctor but had some chest pains.
ITN foreign news editor Robin Staniforth said of the alleged attack:
''We were filming on a public beach and I'm very keen to stress that. We
were about 40 feet away with a camera crew.
''He spotted us and came off the private beach on to the public beach.
He threatened him.
''Subsequently, he kicked him in the chest and bruised him at the very
least.''
Detectives in south London were angry when the Old Trafford idol
failed to appear for questioning at South Norwood police station on
Wednesday about the initial incident two weeks ago.
On Saturday, Manchester United's manager Alex Ferguson was understood
to have told Cantona not to return to his home because camera crews were
still camped outside.
Cantona has been banned from Premiership football for the rest of the
season by his club and fined two weeks' pay -- the maximum sanction
under his contract.
He is also due to appear before the Football Association's
disciplinary committee on February 24 to answer its charges against him.
Whether or not he will face any criminal charge will depend on the
Crown Prosecution Service, who have been sent the relevant papers.
The FA seems likely to consider that what happened on an island
several thousand miles away is outside their jurisdiction and will take
no further action.
''We are in touch with Manchester United to establish the full facts
of what has happened. Until we establish those facts, there is nothing
else we can say,'' said Mr David Davies, the FA's director of public
affairs yesterday.
The FA have yet to decide if they will punish Cantona further for the
Selhurst Park affair -- United having already banned him for the rest of
the season and fined him around #20,000.
0 United have so far remained silent but there is no doubt this latest
incident will further tarnish the club's reputation.

THE Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday criticised a fellow churchman
for ''preaching through headlines'' about the break-up of the Prince of
Wales's marriage.
Dr George Carey also accused the Archdeacon of York, the Venerable
George Austin, of ''megaphone theology''.
The archbishop was speaking publicly for the first time about Mr
Austin's new book, Affairs of State, in which he questions Prince
Charles's behaviour and his future role.
Dr Carey said: ''In an issue such as that of the Royal Family, it's
all very well to talk about, as he seems to be, megaphone diplomacy or
megaphone theology.
''But the Christian Gospel is not simply about condemnation. It's
about renewal, it's about hope.
''And what he cannot know, or perhaps he has not attempted to find
out, is that there are people such as myself giving guidance and
leadership -- but giving it in a pastoral way.
''It is a deeply personal relationship. Now we have to recognise that
there are different levels through which the Christian faith is
communicated -- but preaching through the headlines and condemning
people for sins is not the way I would want to go about it.''
Dr Carey told BBC Radio Four's Sunday programme in an interview from
India with Mike Wooldridge, that he liked Mr Austin as a man but thought
his book was ''slight and superficial''.
''I simply do not recognise the church he describes,'' said Dr Carey,
after reading Mr Austin's criticisms of the Church of England.

ENGLISH regional assemblies will not be given tax-raising or
legislative powers like those proposed for a Scottish parliament, Mr
Jack Straw, Shadow Home Secretary, said yesterday.
His assurances on BBC TV's On The Record indicated that solving the
West Lothian question is less important to the Labour leadership than
avoiding a potential backlash from English voters if the party tries to
give them bodies they don't want.
Mr Straw emphasised: ''It has never, even in a million years, been
Labour's plan to have regional parliaments with tax-raising powers.''
English assemblies were on Labour's agenda, he said, but the time
scale for achieving them was longer than for Scottish and Welsh
parliaments.
To those Scots who see an Edinburgh ''home rule'' parliament as
virtually sovereign in its own sphere, Mr Straw's remark that
Westminster must remain the final authority, may come as a shock.
Powers devolved are powers retained, he said, and the powers of the
Scottish parliament would derive from Westminster.
Other Labour MPs on the programme conceded that Scotland might not be
able to retain 72 Westminster MPs once a Scottish parliament had been
set up.
Mr Jeff Rooker, Shadow Deputy Leader of the Commons, said that if a
domestic parliament were set up ''then you quite clearly have to look at
the role of the UK Parliament and I don't think you can fudge that''.
Mr Andrew Mackinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, said that if domestic
parliaments were set up in Scotland and some English regions like the
North East, a Labour Government at Westminster might have a mandate on
foreign affairs and major economic policy ''but one has to ask whether
it would have a mandate in respect of English education''.
Mr Rooker suggested that Labour's way out of the difficulty could lie
in adopting PR. He said: ''The first-past-the-post system gives a wholly
unfair advantage to the Conservative Party and I think we will have to
tackle that head-on.''
While PR would probably mean more Labour MPs in Southern England, it
would produce more Liberals as well and mean that Labour was unlikely to
rule alone.
Conservative attacks on English assemblies as unwanted and expensive
has produced a more cautious Labour approach to their creation.
Mr Straw, while refusing to pre-empt a paper on his current
consultations, inside and outside the party, to be published in June,
indicated a phased approach.
A first stage would be to establish democratic control over the
various quangos and civil service manned bodies which already exist in
the regions. Each region could be given a development corporation and a
separate democratic body could oversee the health service in each
region.
Mr Blair and his advisers seem to be cooling on the idea of
directly-elected assemblies, at least at first, and are thinking of
manning them with elected councillors.
They are also increasingly aware of the problem of drawing boundaries
which becomes more difficult the further south in England one goes.
Mr Straw said that London, as well as Scotland and Wales, looked a
certain candidate for regional government. However, that would leave a
huge hole in the South East England region which would lack a centre.
Earlier in the same programme, Labour councillor, Mr John Power, of
Oxford, said he had no desire for his city to be part of a South East
region along with, say, Brighton, with which there was no community of
interest, and he had not heard anyone else in Oxford supporting the
idea.

THE closure of the design division at the Rolls-Royce plant at East
Kilbride would hit the development of a new series of engines in a joint
venture in Germany, union officials claimed yesterday.
A delegation of officials are to visit Frankfurt and Berlin tomorrow
for discussions with their counterparts in BRR, the BMW-Rolls-Royce
consortium which is working on a new generation of jet engines.
Last month, Rolls-Royce announced it was closing the aero-engine
design and research facility at the East Kilbride centre, with the loss
of 600 jobs, and transferring its activities to Derby and Bristol.
As part of their campaign to persuade the company to reverse the
decision, union officials are arguing that the change poses a serious
threat to the future of the BRR venture, as the East Kilbride centre has
been involved closely in the design of the new engines.
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions at the plant, said
yesterday: ''The closure will certainly have a delaying effect on the
work being done in Germany but it could also bring it to a complete
stop.
''BRR is a brand-new company and does not yet have the good will to be
able to ride out any slippages. The competition has a lot more muscle.''
He added that the delegation would be telling their German hosts that
Rolls-Royce had not proved any business case for the closure of the East
Kilbride design division.
Joining Mr Thomas in the delegation are Mr Graham Irvine, senior shop
steward for manual workers at the plant, Mr Norrie McIntosh, regional
officer for the Manufacturing, Science, and Finance union, and Mr Adam
Ingram, the Labour MP for East Kilbride.
Rolls-Royce has dismissed claims that the closure of the East Kilbride
design centre could hit the German project. It argues that it can
comfortably handle research and development on existing or future
projects within the capabilities it has at Derby and Bristol.

A 32-YEAR-OLD female office clerk who claimed she had been attacked
and stabbed by a man while working at a psychiatric hospital in Glasgow
has been reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with the
incident.
Strathclyde Police confirmed yesterday that inquiries into an incident
where a woman was allegedly assaulted within an office at the nurses'
home at Leverndale Hospital, Glasgow, were now complete.
A brief statement said: ''We are not looking for anyone else in
connection with this incident. A 32-year-old woman is now the subject of
a report to the procurator fiscal.''
An immediate review of security was ordered at Leverndale after the
alleged attack on January 30. Police inquiries are understood to have
been contained within the hospital.
The incident was claimed to have occurred shortly before 8am in an
office in the administration block at the hospital, on the south side of
Glasgow, despite security procedures already in place, including a
door-entry system.
The woman who claimed to have been attacked was employed by the
Scottish Association for Mental Health.
She was taken to Southern General hospital suffering from a deep stab
wound to her abdomen but has since been released from hospital.

A SINGLE transferable landmine lay in wait for Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson last night in his debate with SNP leader Alex
Salmond over the constitutional question.
Facing each other at claymore's length across the floor of the old
Royal High School building in Edinburgh, they clashed for the television
cameras over what kind of Scottish parliament should meet there --
independent and sovereign, or exercising powers devolved from
Westminster.
The ambush for Mr Robertson came not from his SNP adversary but from a
member of the audience identifying herself as a ''non-party floating
voter''. She asked the two protagonists to list the options of
independence, devolution, and the status quo in their personal order of
preference.
Mr Salmond said that after his first choice of independence, and with
doubts and reservations, he would put devolution second because the
status quo was ''abysmal''.
However, to repeated shouts of ''answer!'' Mr Robertson would only
give devolution as his first choice and refused pointedly to say whether
independence or the status quo came next. Although he described the
latter as ''unacceptable'' he repeatedly refused to specify his choice
between two unpalatable options.
The clash can be seen by BBC viewers tonight.
The question about the personal second choice for the constitution
helped give Mr Salmond a points victory as he concluded with one last
heavy punch: ''There has been some surprise expressed that Ian Lang
isn't here tonight. He doesn't have to be because George Robertson has
used most of his best lines.''
Mr Robertson, for his part, jabbed away at his opponent in an effort
to wear him down in the eyes of the judges as someone who would be
intent on wrecking the body most Scots wanted -- a parliament Mr
Robertson said ''he would be proud to serve in''.
Challenged on such a wrecking role by Mr Andrew Marr, one of the three
London-based Scots journalists acting as inquisitors, Mr Salmond said:
''No. We will want to get Scotland the powerhouse parliament we need.''
He added, in response to a question about what he would do if his
party failed to win a mandate for independence and ended up as a
minority in the devolved parliament: ''Legitimacy in Scotland comes from
the Scottish people. If we were not to succeed then we would have to
participate in a Scottish assembly in the same way as we participate in
Westminster at the moment.''
At the heart of Mr Robertson's case was a desire of Scots for a
parliament that would not break up the UK. ''A strong and powerful
Scottish parliament taking the power out of Whitehall and returning it
to the people, strengthening and renewing our national democracy, will
make a difference. Do we really want to make foreigners of our family
and friends down south?''
Mr Salmond challenged Labour over comments from leading policymaker
Jack Straw that Westminster could make or unmake the devolved body. Mr
Robertson replied that his colleague was speaking in a technical and
legalistic way and in practice no-one would ever attempt to dissolve a
Scottish parliament.
He then challenged Mr Salmond on a separate Scottish currency, leading
to a series of lively exchanges on Tyneside Metro shopping with Scots
notes, exchange rates, the possession of credit cards, and the Irish
experience.
The other exiled Scots journalists asking the questions, Mr James
Naughtie and Mr Neal Ascherson, implied that the two party leaders
should bury their differences for the sake of the majority of Scots who
wanted a parliament of some kind.
However, Mr Robertson said ''That's democracy'' and Mr Salmond was
equally disinclined to lower his own sights. Mr Robertson insisted in
conclusion that the key to constitutional change was that Tories
refused, the SNP dreamed, but only Labour would deliver.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said in a statement last night that the
debate was like an argument between ''Tweedledum and Tweedledum''.
Labour and the SNP might pretend otherwise, but they were both on the
same side of the argument.
He said: ''They both support a separate parliament in Edinburgh and
both their proposals, whatever the initial differences, would eventually
result in a separate Scotland.
''The SNP at least advocate an open and direct route. Under Labour's
plan it would be separation by degrees, but the end result would
inevitably be the same.''

THE taxpayer is keeping Scottish private schools in business, a Labour
MP claimed yesterday.
Ayrshire MP Mr Brian Donohue, who represents Cunninghame South,
launched a stinging attack on the Assisted Places Scheme (APS), which
gives less well-off families the opportunity to send their children to
private secondary schools by giving income-related assistance towards
the cost of tuition, fees, and other expenses.
Figures obtained in parliamentary answers from Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, the Education Minister, show that more than #10m was
spent by the Scottish Office in this year's allocation, helping to fund
the education of almost 3000 pupils at Scottish private schools.
''The fact that the independent educational sector in Scotland, which
had been declining in the late seventies, has expanded since the
introduction of the scheme demonstrates that the Government's policy of
Assisted Places has actually propped up private sector education,'' Mr
Donohue said.
He also claimed that, in addition to helping existing schools, the
scheme has encouraged the foundation of new schools, producing figures
indicating that the number of such schools has increased from 90 to 117
since 1981, when the Government set up the scheme.
The Scottish Office's Education Minister was able to confirm that
#10,263,000 was spent in the financial year 1994-5, providing assistance
for the provisional figure of 2854 pupils.
This compares with figures from 1992-3, when #9.6m was used to fund
the education of 3040 pupils, a contrast seized upon by Mr Donohue, who
highlighted what he saw as a woefully expensive scheme to administer.
A Scottish Office spokesman denied the scheme was used to bankroll
private education: ''This is an extremely popular scheme designed for
parents first to help them afford private education, and it leads to
very little direct financial benefit for any of the schools involved.''

MORE than 6000 skiers headed for the slopes at the three Scottish
winter-sports centres which managed to open for business yesterday.
All the action was on the ski centres in the eastern Highlands because
winds gusting to 60mph kept the Nevis range resort at Aonach Mor, near
Fort William, stormbound.
High winds also kept the White Corries, at Glencoe, shut in the
morning.
At Cairngorm, road-signs were erected and warnings were broadcast on
Ski FM from 10.30am telling any other skiers not to turn up.
By then, there were more than 3000 people out on the slopes and a
spokesman for Cairngorm Chairlift Company said the stay-away warning had
been given for safety reasons.
Only six lifts out of 17 were operating there on the lower runs and at
Coire Cas.High winds kept the upper slopes closed.
Temperatures stayed below zero all day at Cairngorm, which had lots of
fresh snow over the weekend.
Several coachloads of Cairngorm-bound skiers headed instead for the
Lecht Ski centre, where 11 out of the 12 uplifts were operating
yesterday on slopes which had new snow on a firm base.
Around 1500 skiers were on slopes, with sunny skies and temperatures
just above the freezing mark and gentle southerly winds at car-park
level.
The ski runs at Glenshee were also busy yesterday, with around 2500
skiers out on the slopes, where sunshine and snow showers were the order
of the day.
Fifteen out of 26 lifts were working as windy conditions kept the
upper runs out of bounds.
Mr David Stewart, of Glenshee Chairlift Company, said: ''Conditions
here are not bad at all and we have quite a lot of fresh snow, with
temperatures just above freezing.''
Skiers can look forward to ''significant' snowfalls during the coming
week.
Unsettled, windy weather will give way to a colder snap from Tuesday,
with fresh snow at most of the ski centres, said Mr Douglas Yule, of
Castle Douglas-based Weather Watchers, yesterday.

TWO gamekeepers were recovering yesterday after their car was washed
more than 400 yards down a fast-moving, swollen river.
Mr Ronald Orritt, 74, and his son, Geoffrey 46, were swept away as
they crossed a ford in the Yorkshire Dales and were dragged along for
two minutes before their car became stuck in some rocks.
After winding down the window, Mr Ronald Orritt climbed out of the car
and trudged over three miles of moorland to the town of Hawes, where he
raised the alarm for his trapped son.
The two men, both from Preston, Lancashire, had been driving home on
Saturday after collecting pheasants to breed for eggs when the accident
happened.
Although they escaped unharmed from their mishap near Widdale Foot
Bridge, on Widdale Beck -- the area has featured in the television
series All Creatures Great and Small -- their cargo of birds was washed
away.
''We were just swept off the ford and down the river, completely out
of control,'' said Mr Geoffrey Orritt.
''The car floated along like a boat, as we crashed into rocks and went
over rapids -- it was all a bit exciting.
''We got stuck on rocks after a couple of minutes and dad climbed out
of the window. I was trapped and, after he left, I wound up the window
to keep the water out and waited.''
Firefighters freed Mr Geoffrey Orritt from his watery seat. Both men
were well yesterday, although Mr Ronald Orritt said he was a bit stiff
after his trek.
''We usually go over the ford in my Land Rover, not a little Nissan,''
he said. They are now waiting for the water level to drop to rescue the
car.

POLICE mingled with hikers and ramblers yesterday near the lonely
country road where Mrs Margaret Wilson had her throat slashed by a
passing motorist.
Officers warned people in Burton Fleming, Humberside, and the
surrounding area, to take care when out walking.
''It's just a matter of being cautious -- take a friend with you,''
said a spokesman.
''We don't want to frighten people from going out but it's just the
situation we find ourselves in while the murderer is on the loose.''
Mrs Wilson, 66, a keen rambler, was attacked between Burton Fleming
and Rudstone just moments after being dropped off in a car by daughter
Heather Wilson on Thursday.
The attack was witnessed by two horrified farm labourers, who were
ploughing a field. They recognised Mrs Wilson and ran 400 yards to help
but the driver had jogged back to his car and disappeared.
As detectives continued house-to-house questioning in Burton Fleming,
Detective Superintendent Tony Corrigan, who is leading the murder hunt,
appealed for information about the killer's car, a white Montego estate,
which ''cannot have disappeared into a black hole''.
He has said it was a random killing -- the attacker would not have
known that she was on that road at that time.

SCOTTISH Homes, the national housing agency, has reacted to Labour's
criticisms over the transfer of homes to alternative landlords, and to
claims that the agency is stuffing the pockets of private developers.
Its chairman, Sir James Mellon, today calls on the Shadow Scottish
Secretary, Mr George Robertson, to say how he would secure investment
for housing in Scotland.
Last month, Mr Robertson pressed for the resignation of the agency's
board because of what he described as ''repeated and failed attempts to
persuade its members to allow tenants the choice of their own locally
elected councils as alternative landlords''.
Mr Peter McKinlay, the chief executive, also calls today on Labour's
housing spokesman, Mr John McAllion, to ''put the record straight'' over
claims that Scottish Homes was ''stuffing the pockets of private
developers''.
The demands from the agency's two most senior officials come on the
day that Scottish Homes is the main subject of debate at a Scottish
Grand Committee meeting in Edinburgh.
Tenants from the Freedom of Choice Campaign are expected to lobby the
meeting in support of Labour's resignation demand.
Sir James, in a letter to Mr Robertson, writes: ''You have recently
accused the board of Scottish Homes of denying tenants real freedom of
choice.
''But you have failed to suggest or outline by what alternative method
the substantial resources necessary to improve Scotland's housing might
be found if our present policy was to be abandoned.''
He says private investment can be attracted faster and in larger
amounts if ownership transfers to the independent rented sector, such as
housing associations.
Mr McKinlay, in a letter to Mr McAllion, says he was taken aback by
the Labour MP's claim that Scottish Homes was ''stuffing the pockets of
property developers'' and that more money was being handed out to
developers than was being invested in Scottish Homes.
The remarks were ''wrong and totally misleading'', he writes.
Mr McKinlay said a grant mechanism scheme had been developed as part
of the agency's overall aim of improving the quality and variety of
housing options available.
This allowed the agency to fund a wide variety of projects, enabling
many families, particularly first-time buyers, to buy a home at a price
they could afford, he said.
Grant approval of #27m had brought in #74m of private finance,
contributing to the development of more than 2000 new or improved houses
for sale or rent.
Mr McKinlay said the scheme had made a valuable contribution to
reducing council waiting lists and, by providing opportunities for owner
occupation in areas where they did not exist, had helped to stabilise
communities by enabling people to stay.
Meanwhile, tenants of the agency's 110 homes in Lumphinnans, Fife, are
furious about Dunfermline District Council's exclusion from a transfer
ballot which will decide their new landlord. They insist that they
should be given freedom of choice.
In Livingston, the development corporation's 6500 houses are to be
sold in October next year. The disposal is planned two months before the
corporation is disbanded.
Bids for the houses will be considered from approved landlords,
housing associations, or West Lothian District Council. Tenants will
have a ballot vote to choose a new owner. At present, gross rent income
exceeds #11m from houses, garages, and amenity land.

<HEADLINE>It's Australia by the smoky route as the Lovelaces refuse to travel without a fly drag</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

AN EARL and countess are travelling from the Highlands of Scotland to
Australia the long way . . .because they are smokers.
The Earl of Lovelace found, when making arrangements to take his
Australian wife, Katie, home for a holiday, and so keep a promise to her
grandmother, that the quickest route had one major problem.
Using it, he and the countess, both smokers, would have had to forego
nicotine for many hours because of the no-smoking policy of many major
airlines.
The couple therefore planned their journey from Inverness to
Melbourne, not so much by way of the scenic route as by the smokers'
route.
The couple flew from Inverness to London, then on to Los Angeles.
Then it was on the Honolulu, the Cook Islands, Auckland in New
Zealand, and then the ''hop'' to Australia, all with a couple of days
stop-over at each stage to recharge their nicotine banks.
A friend of the family said: ''They just couldn't face so many hours
without a cigarette, so Peter found out which airlines still allow
smoking and planned the journey accordingly.''
In the spring of last year, just after the earl married the
25-year-old former nurse, the couple visited his in-laws, Lem and Nola
Smolders, at Langwarrin, outside Melbourne.
He promised 89-year-old Granny Smolders -- ''a lovely Dutch lady'' --
that he would take his wife home every year.
The earl said at the time: ''Kathie's grandmother was quite firm with
me about what she expected me to do.''
Peter, fifth Earl of Lovelace, whose family seat is at Torridon, in
Wester Ross, is the great-great-great grandson of Lord Byron. He is also
a cousin of the Queen.
Since becoming the countess, Kathie has poured her energies into
improving Torridon House.
New carpets and curtains have been installed, ancient pictures of
ancient Lovelace relatives have been cleaned, and a cosy flat has been
created within the 66-roomed house.
The countess has also taken over a lot of the day-to-day
responsibility for the running of the estate.
One local said: ''She's been like a breath of fresh air.
''She's the best thing that ever happened to Lord Lovelace and, being
a down-to-earth Australian girl, she knows how to keep him in order.
''They seem to be very happy.''

THREE men and a woman were detained by police at the weekend in
connection with alleged drug offences at the Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr.
They are expected to appear today at Ayr Sheriff Court.
There is a fatal accident inquiry currently under way into the
drugs-related deaths last year of three young men, all of whom had been
at the nightclub and died after taking ecstasy.
The four detained in three separate incidents at the club, between
10pm on Saturday and 2am yesterday, were aged from 18 to 24.
Mrs Christine McIntyre, who, with other members of her family,
operates the Pavilion in which Hanger 13 is based, is understood to have
been instrumental in reporting incidents to the police.
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Police said security staff detained four
people and reported to the police. She confirmed they had been held in
connection with alleged offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
They are a 20-year-old male from Neilston, Renfrewshire; a 20-year-old
woman from Dalmarnock; and two men, one 18, from King's Park, Glasgow,
the other 24, from Wishaw, Lanarkshire.
Mrs McIntyre, 48, who is expected to give evidence to the inquiry in
Ayr today, was not available for comment yesterday.
The rave nightclub attracted crowds of more than 1000 from across West
Central Scotland at its peak early last year. However, adverse publicity
surrounding the drugs-related deaths and doubts over the continuation of
the venue's drinks licence have affected attendances.
Only about 500 were at the Pavilion on Saturday night, mirroring
attendances in recent months. Management say entry to the venue, which
costs between #7 and #9, is granted only after stringent security
searches by stewards.
In November, Kyle and Carrick district licensing committee suspended
the club's drinks licence for a year after a complaint from the chief
constable of Strathclyde. McCall's Entertainments, which operates the
Pavilion, has appealed to the sheriff at Ayr and the licence is
operating as normal pending a hearing.
The inquiry heard evidence last week that a range of drugs was
available at the club the night one youth became ill and died after a
rave. One man said he and his friends had taken amphetamine, which they
had bought inside.
The inquiry was also told that a regular drugs dealer at Hanger 13 had
run out of ecstasy tablets the night two young men died, although one
man who travelled from Airdrie for the rave claimed he was able to buy
drugs from the first person he asked.
It also heard a steward say he felt 22 stewards employed to control up
to 1400 people was sufficient.
Mr Fraser McIntyre, 21, of Racecourse View, Ayr, manager of the
Pavilion, told the inquiry that, since the deaths, paramedics, a standby
ambulance, and closed-circuit surveillance had all been introduced.
Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, Ayrshire, and Mr Andrew Dick,
19, from Glasgow, collapsed and died after attending an event on May 1
last year. Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, of Rigside, Lanarkshire, died after
attending a rave event on August 20 last year.

FIVE Scottish islands, an Austrian castle, a French villa, and a Paris
flat are being put on the market by a former Queen's Herald, Count Robin
de la Lanne Mirrlees, because he is being pressed by Lloyd's Insurance
to settle his account.
However, he will not part with his ancestral castle at Inchdrewer in
Banff or his 7000-acre Hebridean island estate of Great Bernera.
The 70-year-old laird has been caught out by being a Lloyd's name in
about 40 syndicates, and owning a salmon farming venture sunk by Norway
dumping of cheap fish.
The count, who inherited three family fortunes, is having to go ahead
with the near #2m sale because he is being pressed to settle his Lloyd's
debts, mainly caused by huge asbestosis awards in America.
Even the telephone at his 60-year-old croft house on Great Bernera has
been cut off -- ''because I can't pay the bill until I sell a few of the
assets''.
The count, who is also a Yugoslavian prince (a title bestowed on him
by his friend, the late King Peter II) is planning to visit the Serbian
islands of Kornat, Zut, Silo, and other ''dependencies'' to start
claiming the rent on the islands he has not visited in the 30 years
since the king gave them to him.
''I am not penniless but I do not have sufficient liquid cash for
Lloyd's. They have been very polite and nice about it but they are now
pressing me in a polite, nice, but now firm way.
''When I saw the thunderstorm approaching and the debts piling up, I
went through mental torture for two years deciding what to sell.
''I have now listed in order of priority what to sell. But definitely
not for sale is Inchdrewer Castle, which has been in the family since
the 1500s, and Great Bernera.
''If I sell the ones I have decided to sell, I will clear my debts and
be content in my old age.''
Up for sale are:
* Ratzenegg Castle, near Villach in Austria, for #500,000, with one
condition: that the new owners provide the count with a flat as a
holiday home for the rest of his life.
* A villa for #410,000 at Le Touquet in France, the home of his late
mother, Countess Frances de la Lanne, whose family made a fortune out of
textiles, property, land, minerals, coffee, tobacco, sugar, and slaves.
* The unoccupied islands off Great Bernera of Flodday, Berisay, Old
Hill, Vacasay, and Little Bernera for a combined #470,000.
* A flat in Paris for #180,000.
* Unspecified ''minor'' assets.
The French-born, Oxford-educated count, whose real father was the
decorated First World War hero and distinquished BBC broadcaster Captain
Duncan Grenille-Milne, has also in the last few years sold a
seven-bedroom house in London's Holland Park for #750,000 and a flat in
Switzerland, mainly to pay off the fish farming debt.
Valuable antiques and paintings have also gone under the hammer and
substantial shares he held on stock markets around the world have been
sold to part fund the Lloyd's debt.
Against the advice of friends -- including that of his 33-year-old
illegitimate son Patrick, the product of a 10-year common law
relationship with a German socialite, the count became a member of
Lloyd's 12 years ago but resigned just before Christmas.
His only marriage to his then 20-year-old nurse (he was 45 at the
time) lasted only a week ''because she thought my friends were
snobbish''.
He held the ceremonial position of Queen's Herald for 17 years, first
as Rouge Dragon then as Richmond.
He said of his insurance losses: ''I am just absolutely bloody furious
towards the American courts for making me sell my mother's home, one of
my castles, and the other stuff because of the ridiculous, cynical, and
spiteful scale of their asbestosis awards. Anybody who had a cough, it
seemed, was due to asbestos.
''I was worth several millions but I do not feel sorry for me -- I
feel sorry for the wonderful people of Great Bernera.
''I fell in love with the people here. That's why I bought the island
in 1962.
''I come from a very philanthropic background and I wanted to provide
university scholarships for young islanders, build an indoor swimming
pool, provide jobs through a hotel, and fund scientific research into
why people here live so long -- but not now I am afraid.
''When I came here, I could have built a mansion but I wanted to live
among the people, be one of them, and not strut around as the new laird.
''My family has always stuck by the principle that you make money by
creative means, and help other people. The Mirrlees supported over 200
orphans, while my real father's family (his mother married for the
second time British General ''Reay' Mirrlees) founded Grinnell College
in Iowa, mainly from a fire sprinkler invention.
''My son inherited a nice sum when he was 15, and he is fine. My
mother's family lost nearly everything in the French Revolution, and
came back. Now it is up to my son to do the same.''

POLICE in Edinburgh were yesterday investigating a fire in a West End
clothing outfitters which is believed to have been started maliciously.
The fire in Wilkies in Shandwick Place is believed to have been
started when inflammable material was pushed through the letter box
shortly after staff left the premises on Saturday night.
The fire caused considerable damage to the entrance area and damaged
the power supply.
The heat shattered a front door window, a few feet from people at a
bus stop.
A taxi driver reported he had seen a group of youths in the doorway
before the discovery of the fire.
Last night, a spokesman for the store said the shop would open for
business today.
Meanwhile, a minor fire occurred in a newsagent across the road from
the outfitters early yesterday.
Firemen were called out shortly after 3am to the R S McColl premises
where they found furniture alight in the basement. The fire was quickly
put out and the shop was open for business yesterday.

LABOUR MP George Galloway was keeping an open mind last night on
whether the theft of a computer from his constituency office in Glasgow
had sinister political overtones.
Special Branch officers and House of Commons security chiefs were
alerted at the weekend after Mr Galloway, MP for Glasgow Hillhead,
discovered that his office in Elderslie Street had been broken into on
Saturday morning.
Mr Galloway's fear that the computer theft may have been politically
motivated stems from the leading role he has assumed in attacking the
ruling regime in Bahrain.
Two weeks ago in The Herald, Mr Galloway claimed British mercenaries
were propping up the oil rich country, a former British possession.
Mr Galloway alleged the emirate was using its security forces, staffed
and trained by British ex-military personnel, to suppress calls for
democracy by opponents of the ruling royal family.
The MP has called on the Prime Minister to investigate the activities
of British citizens working with the emir's security forces, and has
tabled a parliamentary question asking for the background of some of
these men to be disclosed.
Nine people have been killed, more than 1500 people detained without
charge, and dozens illegally deported in the emir's latest crackdown on
pro-democracy opponents.
Mr Galloway said yesterday he did not know if he had been getting
under the skin of certain people in Bahrain and whether someone had
ordered the theft to try to see if he was drawing up a list of culprits.
''But I don't have any evidence,'' he said.
The MP said he had discovered the theft himself at about 10.45am on
Saturday. ''I was passing in my car when I saw the doors to the office
were open. I screeched to a halt then ran in and discovered the office
had been burgled.''
He hurried to a friend's house, where he phoned 999. ''I expected
police cars to come screeching round the corner but this didn't happen.
Thirty-five minutes later, two bobbies came plodding up.''
Mr Galloway said the thieves had cut through a padlock and four
separate locks, which argued a degree of professionalism.
They had taken only his Apple computer and disregarded other
equipment, including a laser printer, fax machine, and two radios, worth
four times the value of the computer. This, allied to the
professionalism, tended to suggest it was a political break-in with
thieves after material connected with his Bahrain campaign.
He said: ''However, if it was political, it was incompetent because
they left a box full of disks sitting next to the computer. This is an
extraordinary blunder. They should not be paid for what is a sloppy
job.''
The disk in his stolen computer contained nothing but telephone
numbers and his diary. ''There were also notes on 14 housing cases in my
constituency. All my sensitive files are kept in a safe in the House of
Commons.''
Mr Galloway said he was not ruling out common theft. However, he
absolved anyone local from the blame. ''None of the local neds would
have done it. I'm popular there and local people keep an eye on my
office.''
He said fingerprint experts had taken away one print from the back of
his desk.
He added that he had spent #1500 on new security measures at his
constituency office.
Strathclyde police said they were investigating the break-in.
* Bahrain, linked to Saudi Arabia by a causeway, was given its
independence from Britain in 1973, when a parliament was set up. This
parliament was closed on the orders of the ruling royal family in 1975,
according to Mr Galloway.
Sporadic uprisings agitating for the return of this parliament, with
the latest beginning in December last year, have met with savage
treatment, he added.

MATERNITY hospitals throughout Scotland are sure to scrutinise their
security measures following the abduction of baby Lydia Owens in Wales.
There will be lessons to be learned, just as there were after the case
of Abbie Humphries, taken from a Nottingham hospital in last July.
That case prompted Scottish maternity units to look carefully at their
security arrangements. Many are considering the use of electronic
tagging so that anybody trying to snatch a baby would set off an alarm.
By coincidence, a pilot trial of baby tagging began at Edinburgh's
Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion days after Abbie was abducted. Those
tests, involving different systems, have recently been completed and the
hospital plans to introduce its preferred option in the next few weeks.
It will also submit a report of its findings to the Scottish Office
Home and Health Department, which will pass on the results to other
hospitals and health boards.
However, the Edinburgh hospital was not the first in Scotland to use
electronic tagging. Law Hospital NHS Trust at Carluke, Lanarkshire,
installed a #6000 full system in its maternity unit four months before
the pilot scheme started.
It appears to have been a success and could provide other hospitals
with part of the answer to the dilemma of how to ensure adequate
protection without unduly restricting public access.
''You either have open visiting in maternity or you don't,'' said Mrs
Irene Barkby, midwifery business manager at the unit. ''We do not
advocate making these places into prisons.
''I think the security now is as good as you are going to get without
having a lock-down in place.''
Representatives of about a dozen other hospitals have visited Carluke
to see how the system works and Mrs Barkby believes that at least one of
them has decided to introduce tagging.
The system is not compulsory. Mothers are asked whether they want
their babies tagged and they all do. This no doubt reflects a greater
awareness among mothers of the possibility of abduction and the need to
reduce the risk.
Would such a tagging system have prevented the Welsh incident? ''It
would have been less likely to happen. Our system sets alarms ringing
all around the unit. If the baby had been ours, we would hope it would
have been discovered before it was outside the building.''
Other security features at Law hospital's maternity unit include
surveillance cameras.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said yesterday: ''After the Abbie
Humphries case, all hospitals started to look at their own security all
the more closely, without any general guidance from the Scottish Office.
It was just common sense.''
Apart from the imminent introduction of a full tagging system, the
Simpson Memorial unit has already stepped up security.
At Glasgow Royal Infimary University NHS Trust's maternity hospital at
Rottenrow, security cameras have been introduced in recent months and
administrators are awaiting the results of the Edinburgh tagging trial.
Several other changes in procedures have been introduced in line with
advice from the Royal College of Midwives.
A hospital spokeswoman said: ''The problem is trying to get the
balance right, so that people in hospitals feel secure but the hospital
is still accessible to the community it serves. We are not running
Barlinnie prison.''
The Royal Aberdeen Hospitals NHS Trust's maternity hospital is looking
very closely at tagging and is awaiting quotations and specifications
from three suppliers.
Surveillance cameras are about to be installed at Dundee Teaching
Hospitals NHS Trust's maternity unit at Ninewells. It is also
considering whether to introduce tagging. Again, various other special
procedures have been introduced since the Abbie Humphries case.

A GROUP of Scottish Labour MPs, outraged at what they see as a blatant
attack on freedom of speech, are set to go against the party's ruling
executive by providing a stall at next month's party conference for
banned anti-abortion campaigners.
The Scottish Labour Party's executive barred the protest group, Labour
for Life, from last year's conference and ruled to uphold the ban for
this year's event, to be held in Inverness.
That decision prompted a furore both within the party and externally,
with Cardinal Thomas Winning angrily contacting Labour leader Tony Blair
twice to protest.
Yesterday, Mrs Helen Liddell, MP for Monklands East, told The Herald a
number of Scottish Labour MPs had been so perturbed by the banning of
Labour for Life they intended to provide a stall themselves for
literature from the group.
She said: ''A group of us of varying religions and opinions were
sitting in the Commons tearoom and this came up. This issue has always
been recognised as a question of conscience and there was a feeling that
this ban was quite outrageous.
''The issue is one of democracy and we decided it would be right for
us to provide a stall for people's views to be expressed.''
One of the group is now investigating the procedure for booking a
stall, which is expected to cost the MPs more than #2000 for the three
day conference in March.
Mrs Liddell said the subject of the row, abortion, was irrelevant.
''The cause they are pushing doesn't matter. This is a question of
freedom of speech.''
She said she did not forsee any clash with the party's executive
despite the fact the ruling body had explicitly decided to continue the
ban on the anti-abortion group.
Mr Jim Devine, chairman of the Scottish Labour Party, also tried to
play down the conflict but added significantly: ''The MPs involved in
this should be looking to follow party policy.''
He said he felt the executive was the victim of unwarranted criticism
over the conference ban: ''All we're doing is following British
guidelines. A ruling was passed by the NEC (the British Labour Party's
policy making body) in the mid-80s about this group and now we're
implementing it.''
Mr Devine said he believed that ban had been motivated by problems
experienced in England, though he was unable to provide details of any
incidents.
The MPs' proposal, while welcomed, failed to mollify the Catholic
Church in Scotland. Cardinal Winning has written twice to Mr Blair
urging him to intervene and yesterday the Cardinal's press agent
indicated his anger that the ban remained.
Father Noel Barry said: ''Even if this back-door compromise does
happen, that merely pragmatically answers what is a question of
principle, namely the right of free speech.''
He emphasised that the Cardinal still expected Mr Blair to act,
tackling what he saw as the ''frightening intransigence'' of the
Scottish executive and ''clear up what is clearly an absurd situation''.
Mr John Connelly, co-ordinator of Labour of Life, said last night that
he would be contacting the party's national general secretary, Mr Tom
Sawyer, asking for the group's case to be heard.
It is believed to have members in more than 30 Scottish constituency
parties, and had operated an information stall at five previous Scottish
conferences prior to the 1994 ban.

A #170,000 special needs centre is to be opened in Dundee to support
students with disabilities.
The regional facility, based at Dundee University, also involves the
University of Abertay, Northern College, and St Andrews University.
It will aim to improve provision particularly for students with
dyslexia and visual impairments, groups which account for the majority
with special needs.
Of around 17,000 students at the four institutions, 246 have been
identified as having a disability and, of that number, more than 120 are
dyslexic and at least 14 are visually impaired.
The centre contains a range of equipment including computers with
speech recognition facilities, Braille printer, and specialised
software.
Mr Steve Cannon, Dundee University deputy secretary, said: ''The
establishment of such a centre will be a great asset to students with
special needs throughout Tayside and Fife and underlines Dundee's
position in the vanguard of special-needs provision and expertise in
Scottish higher education.''
''In addition to providing support for students with special needs,
the centre could potentially be available to provide support to the
local population.''

THE campaign to save the Motorail and sleeper services to Fort William
continued to gain momentum at the weekend with a rally in Inverness,
where Highland MPs urged protesters to keep up the pressure.
Railworkers in Fort William, meanwhile, were talking of industrial
action.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye,
told the rally, attended by more than 100 in Inverness Town House on
Saturday, he thought the campaign was beginning to make progress.
He said: ''The fightback which started in Fort William one month ago
has come a long way already. Following the various events of the past
week, I am confident that it will prove simply impossible to foreclose
the Motorail and sleeper services in advance of a comprehensive
consultation exercise. This is a decisive breakthrough in itself.
''However, we have to keep the pressure up. There is no way that
Scottish Office Ministers must be allowed off the hook. They must be
left in no doubt that the political and parliamentary pressure is more
than matched by the public generally.
''That is why I urge everyone in the hall today, and everyone outside
it across the Highlands, to put pen to paper and write to the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Transport. The bigger the deluge
of mail, the better the prospect of victory.''
Mr Kennedy said he and his parliamentary colleagues would be meeting
the chairman of the UK Rail Users Consultative Committee this week to
discuss tactics.
''I am greatly encouraged that both the UK and Scottish RUCCs have
taken such a consistent and strong line. That again strengthens the
case.''
His colleague, Sir Russell Johnston, meanwhile, called on the Rail
Regulator to intervene to instruct the Rail Franchise Director, Mr Roger
Salmon, to put the Motorail and sleeper services to Fort William and
Carlise back into the passenger service requirements.
Despite the growing confidence of the campaigners, there is no
indication that Mr Salmon is being persuaded to think again. The Herald
tried to contact him to ask his reaction to the news last week that
Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro had given a commitment to a
full formal consultation on the proposed cuts.
Mr Salmon was not available but his office later issued a statement
which made clear that, while he would listen to arguments, the services
would still be withdrawn.
The statement said: ''The franchising director has indicated that he
will not include the Motorail and Fort William sleeper services in the
draft passenger service requirement (PSR) for the ScotRail franchise,
which he will be issuing later this year, probably by the end of May.
''The franchising director does, however, take into account
representations on services he has not included in draft PSRs and this
will be the case in respect of the overnight services to Fort William.''
Meanwhile, Mr Phil McGarry, Scottish organiser of railworkers' union,
RMT, met local members in Fort William at the weekend to discuss
management plans for the West Highland Line, which include shedding jobs
in the town and transferring others to Mallaig. The withdrawal of
overnight services was also on the agenda.
Mr McGarry said afterwards: ''There were calls for the union to look
at the possibility of seeking a ballot for industrial action.''
He said he would be writing to the general secretary of the Scottish
Trades Union Congress demanding that a national transport conference be
held in Scotland to address the Government's transport policy and call
for the rescinding of the Railways Privatisation Act of 1993.
* Meanwhile, the Stop This Railway Madness (STORM) campaign is
distributing thousands of postcards to supporters to send to the Rail
Regulator demanding that formal consultation takes place before sleeper
or Motorail services are withdrawn.
Mr Brian Wilson, Opposition spokesman on trade and industry, said:
''The consultation should not only be about whether the Tories are
allowed to close these services, as part of their demented rail
privatisation scheme, but also about how they could be promoted and made
more viable. That is the debate we have never been allowed.''

<TEXT>
A 39-year-old woman was charged last night with the abduction of baby
Lydia Owens, from Glam Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan, Clwyd, North Wales,
police disclosed.
Three men, aged 22, 23, and 29, who were also helping police with
their inquiries after the kidnap of the baby on Friday, were released
from police custody yesterday without charge.
The woman, who comes from Rhyl but has not been identified, will
appear before Prestatyn magistrates today.
Details of the charge came shortly after the baby's parents, Christine
and Michael Owens, took their six-day-old daughter home from the
hospital, where all three had been since she was recovered on Saturday
night.
The couple said an emotional goodbye to Staff Nurse Meryl Webster, who
had comforted them after their baby -- then only four days' old --
disappeared from her cot in the maternity unit.
Mrs Ownes and her husband, 38, a hotel porter in Llandudno, left the
hospital maternity unit to rejoin their other children, Kathryn, four,
and Andrew, one.
Police said that a flood of information had followed a televised
appeal by Mrs Owens, 32, on Saturday evening.
A former woman soldier told yesterday how her military training helped
her lead police to the baby.
In newspaper reports, Belinda Ralph, 25, said she saw a couple with a
child just minutes after learning of the abduction, and became
suspicious of their behaviour.
She noted down the number of the car they were getting into, and
phoned the police.
She said she had been seven years in the Army and served in Germany
where there were regular terrorist attacks, and had been taught always
to be on the alert.
Police praised her quick thinking for saving them hours of work.
Before the couple emerged from the hospital, solicitor Liz Choat read
a brief statement on their behalf, thanking ''police and hospital staff
for all their support and help and indeed to the press for their
assistance in giving vital publicity''.
There were no security cameras in the two-year-old maternity unit, and
an investigation is under way.
Mr Ian Bellingham, a spokesman for Glam Clwyd Hospital, said it did
not believe cameras were the complete answer to hospital security.

A MAN drowned yesterday when he fell into a flooded river while
searching for his son, who had already been found by his two older
brothers.
The 39-year-old man was walking with his three sons when the youngest,
aged four, fell in upstream of a tunnel carrying flood water.
As the man started a frantic search, he also fell in and was carried
through the tunnel and into a weirpool below.
The accident happened on the West Sussex/Hampshire border.
A police spokesman said the older brothers, aged 10 and seven, found
the young boy and pulled him from the water.
''Despite the strenuous efforts of his children, their mother, a
neighbour and an ambulance crew, the man was found to be dead on arrival
at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester,'' he said.
His name was being witheld until all his relatives had been informed.
Two gamekeepers meanwhile were recovering yesterday after their car
was washed more than 400 yards down a fast-moving, swollen river.
Mr Ronald Orritt, 74, and his son, Geoffrey, 46, were swept away as
they crossed a ford in the Yorkshire Dales and were dragged along for
two minutes before their car stuck in rocks.
Mr Ronald Orritt climbed out of a window and trudged over three miles
of moorland to the town of Hawes, where he raised the alarm for his
trapped son.
The two men, both from Preston, Lancashire, had been driving home on
Saturday after collecting pheasants to breed for eggs. The birds were
washed away.
''The car floated along like a boat, as we crashed into rocks and went
over rapids: it was all a bit exciting,'' said the son.

TV presenter Paula Yates and singer Bob Geldof have agreed to a trial
separation after 18 years together, it was reported yesterday.
The couple announced their intention to take a break from ''being in
each other's faces all the time'' in a faxed note to the News of the
World, the paper claimed.
The note, written in the style of a press release, says: ''After 18
years of happiness together, Bob and Paula Geldof decided to have a
break from each other for a while.''
It goes on: ''They both love each other fantastically and adore their
children and for them that's all that matters really.
''This is a break from 'being in each other's faces all the time'. Or
to put it in what Bob calls the 'repulsive parlance' of the day, they
are 'giving each other some space'.
''They will see and speak and eat with each other daily, occasionally
go out together and continue to love one another. They are each other's
best friend.''
Neighbours of the couple seemed unaware of their rift.
Neither the rock singer nor the Big Breakfast presenter were at their
#450,000 Victorian terrace home in Chelsea.
A woman who said she had lived in the street for 60 years said she had
last seen Yates on Friday after she came back from doing her show.
''She was with her nanny and she appeared to have some packed bags and
they left in a red van.''
The woman, who refused to give her name, added: ''I haven't seen him
for a while. I don't like him. He's scruffy.''
Other neighbours did not want to speak about the couple. One said:
''They're quite secretive -- they keep themselves to themselves.''
One report said both stars had gone on holiday to get away from the
''ructions'' caused by their announcement.
A Channel 4 spokesman said Paula Yates would not be appearing on the
Big Breakfast show this week.
''She was already rostered to be away on holiday this week,'' he
added.
He could not say how long the holiday had been arranged or how long
she was due to be away, he said.

<HEADLINE>More crime warning on prisoners' rent cut</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979878370</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PLANS to scrap housing benefit for prisoners serving more than three
months are today condemned by the Penal Affairs Consortium, a pressure
group which says the move could lead to more crime.
The idea of reducing the time a prisoner's rent will be paid from 52
weeks to 13 weeks was announced by Social Security Secretary Peter
Lilley at last October's Conservative conference. ''We shouldn't go on
paying criminals' rents. They should be paying their debt to society,''
he said.
In its submission to the social security advisory committee, the
consortium says the move is short-sighted and likely to increase crimes
committed by released prisoners.
A ''substantial number'' would lose their homes and possessions
between their 13th and 52nd week in custody as a result, it said.
It quoted Home Office research indicating that prisoners who were
homeless on release were more than twice as likely to re-offend as those
with homes.
Mr Paul Cavadino, who chairs the PAC, said: ''Any money saved by the
change is likely to be lost several times over by the costs of further
offending, including the cost of police time, court time, and further
prison sentences. The Government should think again and withdraw this
misguided proposal.''
Ms Mary Honeyball, general secretary of the Association of Chief
Officers of Probation, one of the groups in PAC, said: ''This
contemptible measure will be as counter-productive as it is
vindictive.''
The PAC alliance includes probation officers' groups, the Prison
Officers' Association and Prison Governors' Association, and campaigners
such as the Howard League for Penal Reform.

EXCLUSIVE
THREE Scottish women are to receive more than #20,000 following
out-of-court settlements of long-standing claims for equal pay for work
of equal value.
Their cases were among 30 lodged with 17 electricity companies in 1990
by their union, Unison, which points out that the awards coincide with
the 25th anniversaries of both the equal pay and sex discrimination
Acts.
Two of the women work for ScottishPower. Ms Liz Cummings, a
telephonist who has since been promoted to supervisor, won her case at
an industrial tribunal last year and the amount of the award was due to
be determined at a further hearing next week.
However, in an out of court settlement this week, ScottishPower agreed
to bring her previous salary as a telephonist into line with that of a
male store-keeper which, with interest, means a back payment of #14,359.
Another ScottishPower employee Ms Hiliary McGuinness, a mail order
clerk, has also had her salary brought into line with that of a male
store-keeper. This increase, plus backdating with interest, comes to
#6698.
Unison assistant secretary for electricity Ms Judith Secker said she
was pleased with the settlements but regretted that Scottish Power had
not reacted like other electricity companies which settled similar
claims years ago.
In a third out-of-court settlement this week, Ms Margaret Ferguson, a
stores clerk with Scottish Nuclear, received an undisclosed payment
after her salary was upgraded in line with that of a male store-keeper.

PERSONAL friendship took a back seat last night as two senior
councillors battled for a seat on the new Glasgow unitary authority.
The contest to be Labour candidate at Cardonald resulted in a
comfortable victory for senior district councillor James McCarron over
Strathclyde regional councillor Joseph McLean.
They are close personal friends; indeed Mr McLean is godfather to Mr
McCarron's youngest son.
The victorious Mr McCarron said last night: ''I didn't want it to be
like this but politics is a cruel discipline.
''My friendship with Joe McLean is undiminished.''
Both hold senior positions on their respective councils.
Mr McCarron chairs the district council's policy control board, which
has authority over the building and works department, while Mr McLean is
chairman of economic and industrial development with the regional
council.

THE Prime Minister yesterday promised to fight to maintain immigration
controls.
However, his letter replying to Mr Charles Wardle, who resigned from
the Government on Saturday, implicitly admits that the UK will come
under pressure from its European Union partners to accept total freedom
of movement within the union.
Mr Wardle, 55, who was the Home Office Minister in charge of
immigration for two years before being moved sideways to the Department
of Trade and Industry in last year's reshuffle, fears that more lax
procedures in other member states will mean that illegal immigrants
admitted by another partner could move on into Britain without hindrance
if current checks are dropped.
Mr Wardle, MP for Bexhill and Battle, said yesterday that this would
amount to ''leaving the back door open'' and bluntly accused Mr Major of
failing to defend Britain's interests.
He said: ''What we don't want is an unchecked flow of vast numbers of
people who would possibly stay here, creating huge costs for our health,
social security, and housing services. That would be unacceptable. It is
not what the British people want.''
The Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, said: ''I can make it
absolutely clear we have no intention of dismantling our frontier
controls.''
However, Mr David Hunt, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, admitted
on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost that the European Commission was not
satisfied that the British opt-out on immigration (won by Mrs Thatcher
in 1985) is ''as valid as we say it is''. The opt-out was agreed by all
the other EU heads of government at the 1985 summit, when Britain agreed
to the Single European Act.
The European Court of Justice has been asked by the Commission to
interpret Article 7A of the Act on free movement of persons within the
Union.
Britain's position, reiterated by the Home Office yesterday, is that
it concerns only movement of EU citizens and not non-EU visitors, for
whom Britain is entitled to use what controls it thinks appropriate.
Next month, seven EU countries -- Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland,
Germany, France, Spain, and Portugal -- will start operating the
Schengen Treaty they have signed which will require non-EU nationals to
obtain only one visa to visit all of them. Italy and Greece are likely
to join the scheme later in the year.
The timing of Mr Wardle's resignation could be related to this. His
decision raises the profile of immigration as an issue for the back
benches.
He has made plain his misgivings privately to ministerial colleagues
over the past 15 months, but is dissatisfied with their response.
His resignation, the second from the Government in a week following
that of Scottish Industry Minister Allan Stewart, is an embarrassment to
Mr Major, reflected in the rather frosty tone of his reply to Mr
Wardle's resignation letter.
Immigration is always an emotive issue within the Conservative Party
and could become so in the country if Mr Wardle's vision of much larger
numbers of illegal immigrants arriving was accepted by the public.
When he told his constituency why he resigned, he was given a standing
ovation. Bexhill Councillor Jean Hopkinson said: ''What he says is quite
right. Our frontiers should not just be thrown open to everyone.''
Mr Major referred to the existing controls as ''a vital safeguard''.
Mr Howard said the controls would be one of the issues considered by the
Cabinet Committee set up to prepare for next year's inter-governmental
summit.
For the moment, Ministers want to see how the Schengen Treaty
arrangements work and await the ruling on opt-out from the European
Court. It could be the second half of the year before they can judge how
real is the threat to Britain's immigration controls.
Mr Wardle's resignation gives the Tory Euro-sceptics another strong
card to play in arguing that the Government and Parliament are steadily
being stripped of powers which used to be considered essential to nation
states.
It is another headache for party chairman Jeremy Hanley, who was
forced to admit yesterday that on the single currency issue Cabinet
unity only extended to not joining in 1996 or 1997.
He admitted that the Cabinet might have to take a decision in 1999 --
after the next General Election.

THE search for a young bookshop manager from Glasgow who has been
missing in the White Corries area of Glencoe since Friday was called off
last night amid growing fears for his safety.
With gales gusted to more than 60mph, 87 searchers joined the second
day's hunt for Mr Allan Sands, 24, of Torrisdale Street, Strathbungo,
Glasgow, who was last seen on the Inverness-shire boundary with Argyll
on Friday. He had left no details of his planned climbing route -- a
precaution that is always recommended.
A spokesman at the Search and Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Pitreavie
Castle, Fife, said last night: ''We will have to rethink the way ahead
here. Obviously the longer that time passes the less chance we have of
finding Mr Sands alive. But the search will continue in the morning.''
Members of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team, who had scoured the area on
Saturday for Mr Sands, were joined yesterday by three other mountain
rescue teams, members of the Search and Rescue Dog Association, and a
search and rescue helicopter.
The area was swept by blizzards on Friday night, followed by a rapid
thaw on Saturday, prompting fears that Mr Sands might have been caught
in a avalanche.
Nine other climbers caught in avalanches and a spate of other
accidents this weekend in the Cairngorms should never have been in the
area, one expert claimed yesterday.
Mr Blyth Wright, a spokesman for the Scottish Avalanche Information
Service, said warnings had been issued on Friday night and again on
Saturday that areas like Coire An t'Sneachda in the Cairngorms were high
avalanche risks. Eight people were taken to hospital but no-one was
seriously injured.
''I am surprised that anyone was in that area. We urge hillwalkers to
check our information line before going on the hill so they can avoid
this sort of trouble,'' Mr Wright said.
He added: ''I do not know the full circumstances of the avalanche
incident and whether these people should have checked beforehand, but
the kind of conditions they would have immediately experienced in that
area were pretty clear.
''There was a high avalanche risk and they should not have continued
their climb. I spoke to an experienced Alpinist and he did not go into
that area because of the high risk. It is not a place I would have
been.''
Mr John Allen, the leader of Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, said:
''There was a high-risk grade four warning in force for the Cairngorms.
On days like that, climbers can be sitting targets on some of our
slopes. There were 80 to 100 climbers out on Coire An t'Sneachda alone
and it was surprising there were not more casualties.''
''Conditions were ideal for an avalanche in the gullies but there were
dozens of people in the area at the time. It is difficult to keep people
away. They come up for the weekend and do not want to waste their
time.''
Mr Stephen Carr, 20, one of a party of 16 from Newcastle University
fell-walking society, was practising ice-axe techniques yesterday in the
Chalmain Gap area when he fell 25ft into a burn.
He was taken off the mountain by members of the Cairngorm Mountain
Rescue Team and taken to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, with head and
back injuries.
Of eight climbers taken to Raigmore Hospital on Saturday, five were
still detained last night.
The first of a series of incidents in blizzard conditions in Coire an
t'Sneachda, near Aviemore, happened when two climbers, who were roped
together, fell 75ft.
Mr Anthony Park, 29, of Sheffield, was treated for head and leg
injuries in Raigmore Hospital. His colleague, Mr Roger Whetton, 48, from
Stockport, had a broken arm and was released after treatment.
As this incident was being dealt with, an avalanche further down the
same corrie engulfed six climbers. Five of them were injured.
Two climbers from Sheffield, Mr Phillip Birch, 23, and Mr Kevin McNee,
both suffered broken bones. Mr Birch suffered a broken leg and wrist,
and Mr McNee's pelvis was shattered. Mr Geoffrey Haig, 44, and Mr Joe
Lenham, 21, both of Huddersfield, and Mr Miles English, 18, from Elgin,
were all treated for severe bruising. All five were airlifted to
hospital. Mr Haig was released after treatment.
In a separate incident, a climber fell at Cairngorm's Red Gully. The
man, who has not been named, managed to walk off the hill with help from
Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, and was taken to hospital by ambulance.

THE people of Dresden crowded into the city's Roman Catholic cathedral
yesterday to remember and to pray for peace.
Outside stood Mr Derek Jackson, just one of thousands of RAF crew who
took part in one of the Second World War's most horrific attacks 50
years ago.
''The flames could be seen from 200 miles away as we approached the
city,'' the 69-year-old former gunner recalled. ''It was scary but we
knew we had a job to do.''
A firestorm engulfed the city. More than 25,000 were killed and eight
square miles of baroque and Renaissance buildings destroyed.
Yesterday's ceremony was marred when a dozen young protesters ran in
front of the altar and started to unfurl banners before being wrestled
to the ground by security guards.
However, the mood was of peace. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, Prime Minister of
Saxony, said there was no resentment of the past and stressed that the
cathedral altar contained two dates: February 13, 1945, when the raid
began and January 30, 1933, when Hitler came to power.
''These dates commemorate the source of the terrible experience and
the terrible experience itself,'' he said, adding there was ''an
emphasis on reconciliation''.
Mr Jackson, from Manchester, echoed his feelings, saying he was
''welcomed very well indeed''.
In a moving ceremony, 10 simple wooden crosses bearing the names of
cities which suffered appalling destruction were carried to the altar.
They included Coventry and St Petersburg with German ones.
The Bishop of Coventry gave a prayer for peace and its Lord Mayor, Mr
Nick Nolan, said it was a ''wonderful day for our two cities that we can
all meet here at the church and heal our differences and put wars behind
us forever''.
Tens of thousands, many with candles, later filled the streets for a
unique requiem played by bells in 46 churches across the city. Most
people gathered at the bombed-out Church of Our Lady, whose giant
cupola, once Dresden's most famous landmark, is being rebuilt.

THE Scottish Secretary, out to crush demands for self-government,
warned yesterday that a future Tory Chancellor at Westminster might
slash expenditure north of the Border.
By opting for devolution, Mr Ian Lang warned Scots, they would lose
influence in the Cabinet, leaving the way open for a Chancellor to
reduce per capita spending to the same level as the rest of the UK:
resulting in a massive #2845m cut, which would put 19p in the pound on
income tax in Scotland if services were to be maintained.
There was an angry response to Mr Lang's apocalyptic vision of life
under a Scottish parliament. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim
Wallace said his comments ''had struck a new and unpleasant tone which
amounted to bullying tactics'' against those seeking self-government.
''The ever-wilder numbers produced by the Tories show that they know
they are losing the debate,'' said Mr Wallace. ''Nobody who supports a
Scottish parliament suggests that equalisation should be abandoned. Or
would Tory vindictiveness know no bounds?
''He has produced dubious figures which are alarming and designed to
scaremonger, saying that if the Scots take this line a Tory Chancellor
will punish them. It is in keeping with some of the anti-Scots sentiment
being expressed by English Tories in the South, but I must say it is
alarming coming from the Secretary of State for Scotland.''
According to the assistant general secretary of the Scottish Labour
Party, Mr Tommy Sheppard, such tactics showed the debate was running
away from Mr Lang.
''What a shame for Scottish public life that Scotland's first elected
official can't even be bothered to examine properly the proposals he is
so intent on attacking,'' he said.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Lang was now ''howling hysterically
from the sidelines, behaving like a spoilt child because of the lack of
support for him, his party, and their constitutional stance''. He
rubbished the figures as ''the economics of the kindergarten'' and said
it was possible to demonstrate that Scotland was pulling its weight
economically.
Mr Salmond added: ''What is significant is that Lang is directing his
fire at the devolution case because that is signficantly weaker than the
case of independence, which I will happily debate with him any time.''
Mr Lang had issued a statement saying a devolved Scottish parliament
would have serious problems from day one which could be solved only by
taxing the Scots heavily. He cited the fact that, with 8.8% of the UK
population and raising only 8.3% of UK revenue, Scotland received 10% of
UK expenditure.
''By setting up a parliament in Edinburgh, and transferring so much
power from Westminster, we would sacrifice the powers we have at present
to protect Scotland's share,'' he said.
''A British Chancellor could cut our funding and, with no voice in
Cabinet, we would be powerless to stop him. If a Chancellor decided to
reduce the funding transferred to a Scottish parliament to the same
level as the rest of the UK, funding would be cut by almost #2845m.
''To replace that would need additional taxation in Scotland, on top
of UK taxation, of 19p on Scottish income tax just to stand still. We
will put the funding arguments at the centre stage of the debate and
challenge the proponents of change to address the arguments.''
Mr Lang also warned on Jonathan Dimbleby's ITV programme that
devolution would lead down the ''slippery slope to separation'' and was
''dangerous, if you value the integrity of our national state''.
Sources close to Mr Lang denied last night the Scottish Secretary was
being bullying or threatening, and said he was simply pointing out the
fiscal realities to which Scotland would be exposed if the relationship
with Westminster were weakened.
''He isn't saying this cut would automatically happen,'' said an aide.
''He is saying that over time there is a distinct possibility that
Scotland would be unable to get the preferential treatment it is getting
at the moment.
''Negotiations will continue with the Treasury for all spending
departments and Scotland would be an easier target without a Secretary
of State. That's not a threat: it's making people aware of the practical
realities.''
On Mr Lang's economic claims, Professor Brian Ashcroft, director of
the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University, said:
''Broadly, he is probably right that expenditure is greater than revenue
in Scotland but whether he is right in terms of degree is another
matter.''
He said the question of what is UK expenditure is ''very difficult to
disentangle and there is a real need for research in this area''.
