IT'S interesting how views on residential letting as an investment
have changed over the years, says Anne Neilson, director with Speirs
Parnie Residential.
''Circumstances have changed dramatically,'' she points out. ''With
rent deregulation, and the pump priming of the Business Expansion
Scheme, there has been an upsurge in good quality property to let.
''It has been matched by strong demand from a public which no longer
sees buying as essential. This is especially so in an employment market
where mobility can be the key to successful job hunting.''
The result? Investment in residential letting can be attractive,
giving a good return and long-term capital growth.
''Speirs Parnie is very well established. We must go back about 100
years,'' Anne Neilson says. ''We are also well-known in terms of
property management. Going into residential letting fairly recently has
been a good move, we believe.
''The landlord and the tenant both have needs to be met. This whole
business, after all, is about people, not about property. We have to
understand individual needs. Today, there is very much greater
acceptance of letting and there is a much wider market .
''We tend to be in the market for properties in the city centre and
the West End, but not exclusively. It is interesting to see moves to
custom-built flats. Again, it is a market that is attracting
investors.''
There is, for example, that attractive development of The Galleries,
just about opposite the actual Art Galleries at Kelvingrove. A modern
one-bedroom part-furnished flat offers electric heating and comes with
optional parking. It is the kind of property that is proving very
popular. Yours for #375 a month.
More into the city centre as such, and Atlantic Apartments would be
the draw. In this case, a modern two-bedroom fully furnished flat comes
with lounge/dining room, electric heating and optional parking space.
This time it is #500 a month.
Other flats in this area provide one or two bedrooms, part-furnished,
with lounge/dining area, kitchen and bathroom. Electric heating and
optional parking space. Variously #350 or #450 a month.
Moving up the scale a bit, a two-bedroom flat in the Charing Cross
area, fully furnished and offering private parking, comes in at #475 a
month.
Round the corner and on a short distance is Dalhousie Court. Again a
modern development, with two bedrooms in a fully furnished flat. Parking
is also available as a welcome item. Rent is #550 a month.
Kelvinbridge is convenient for shopping, transport, and social
facilities. A ground-floor flat here, single bedroom but fully
furnished, goes for around #400 a month.
Out of town? Thorntonhall is always a popular place. Think of a
magnificent flat, with leisure centre-cum-swimming pool in the block.
Lounge with balcony, and dining room off, through glass sliding doors.
Three gorgeous bedrooms, one en suite. Central heating. Garage. A kind
of lottery-winner's lifestyle, you might feel. And all for #1300 a
month.

A GROUP of Dundee students holds the key to lower Scottish
conveyancing fees, but the Scottish Office has slammed and bolted the
door to their new profession.
Despite vowing to break the solicitors' monopoly on conveyancing north
of the Border, the government has delayed implementing its own new rules
which would allow ''licensed conveyancers'' to compete with solicitors
for the provision of residential property legal services.
Estate agents claim that competition would break the solicitors'
monopoly, reduce conveyancing costs, and improve efficiency.
Under the 1990 Law Reform Act, the Scottish Office was empowered to
set up the Scottish Conveyancing and Executry Board which would be
responsible for ''regulating the provision of conveyancing services by
persons other than solicitors.'' Such independent conveyancers already
operate successfully in England.
Anticipating the need for qualified entrants to the new profession,
Dundee's University of Abertay set up a course in 1992 to train people
to be independent conveyancers and executors. The two-year course was to
be followed by two years practical work in a solicitor's office before
the graduates could start practising on their own.
The day after the first students took their seats, in September 1992,
the Scottish Office suspended the Conveyancing and Executry Board for
two years, claiming that the market was too slow to justify the
acceptance of the new independents.
Last June, Scottish Office minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie continued
the suspension for a further two years, although a review was promised
for this summer.
In four weeks time the first Abertay graduates will be presented with
the scrolls which qualify them for entry into a profession which has
been smothered at birth by its midwives, the Scottish Office ministers.
There are about 120 students working their way through the course at
Abertay, with about 50 in their final year. Student spokesman Mike
Devine was attracted into the course after being made redundant by
Prudential Insurance.
''None of us can practise as licensed conveyancers until the
suspension of the Board is lifted. We're all dismayed by this
predicament. Some of the students have had to live with this for the
last three years - it has been very unsettling.''
The students banded together to take counsel's opinion on their
situation and were advised that they should seek a judicial review of
the Scottish Office's suspension.
''Counsel said that we should address three main issues,'' says Mike
Devine. ''Firstly, does the Minister of State have the power to suspend
the Board? No such powers are listed in the Act. Secondly, we should
address his reasons for the suspension - the property market is slow,
but that does not justify suspending the Board. Thirdly, we were advised
that we might have a claim on the grounds that the law of the land is
being undermined by the Scottish Office's decision to suspend the
Board.''
However, Lord Fraser can rest easy in his bed. ''We don't have the
cash to take out an action,'' admits Mike Devine.
But the students' cause is being backed by the UK's leading estate
agent. May Storrie, the new president of the National Association of
Estate Agents, is calling for an end to the solicitors' monopoly on
conveyancing which she describes as ''a pernicious restrictive
practice''.
According to the NAEA, the existing system in Scotland means that
owner-occupiers are forced to bear the high cost of an ''antiquated
regime.''
Through its Scottish Parliamentary Committee the agents' association
is campaigning for for the the Board's re-instatement and hence the
eventual introduction of independent conveyancers in competition with
the solicitors.
May Storrie says: ''It is essential that when the growing numbers of
owner-occupiers wish to move house, they should have the freedom to
employ qualified conveyancers and not be caged by an onerous solicitors'
monopoly. Increased consumer choice would mean a healthier housing
market and more expeditious conveyancing.''
She claims that many house sales fall through because of slow
conveyancing by solicitors.
Kenneth Pritchard, secretary of the Law Society of Scotland, rejects
accusations that solicitors are delaying the house-selling process.
''That is an ignorant perception as to what conveyancing is all about.
It is a detailed and important business.''
Lawyers had a great deal of sympathy for the Abertay students. ''They
believed in good faith that there would be a job for them to go to, only
to find the oportunity taken from them by the Secretary of State. It's
very unfortunate and if they go to judicial review we will do nothing to
obstruct them.''
However, he declined to join the estate agents' call for the
re-convening of the Conveyancing and Executry Board. ''Certainly not.
There's more than enough competition in conveyancing as it is and we
would not welcome more. But we won't obstruct the process. If the Board
is re-convened we will work with it and advise its members.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said that last summer's further
postponement had been agreed because ministers decided that ''nothing
much had changed in two years''. But the question of re-convening the
Board was again under review ''at this moment''.

DATING back to the seventeenth century, Kirkfield House nestles on a
hillside overlooking the Clyde Valley above Kirkfieldbank, Lanarkshire.
Earliest records show it was gifted to a favourite soldier by a grateful
King James.
In later years it passed into the hands of a rich Glasgow merchant and
then to his son, who was one of the earliest mill owners in now what has
become the world-renowned conservation village of New Lanark.
The house still retains much of its old character including splendid
gardens, a walled garden, stables and outbuildings -- though some of
these are slight dilapidated. Old hunting dog kennels are still in
existence.
Kirkfield House has six bedrooms and three bathrooms on the first
floor, a library, drawing room, dining room and further rooms on the
ground floor.
The grounds consist of six acres and there is planning permission for
converting the stables to a house.
The property is being marketed by Clyde Property in Shawlands. Tel.
0141-632-3777. Offers over #198,000 are invited.

A TRADITIONAL house in a traditional village will always sell well,
despite the potential problems of repairs, upkeep, and heating costs.
But there is a house on the market at North Queensferry which comes with
two extra advantages.
The first is its spectacular views of the Forth Bridge. The second is
that, although designed to chime in with the surrounding
eighteenth-century Scottish architecture, No.27 Main Street is only five
years old.
One of a pair of houses built in 1990 under the supervision of an
architect, it has all the appearance of something much more traditional
yet comes with all of the advantages of modern construction, insulation
and central heating.
All of the main rooms face directly onto the Forth, with tremendous
views of the Bridge and the small bay of North Queensferry.
Accommodation includes lounge, open-plan kitchen and dining room, four
bedrooms, and utility room. The house has its own patio garden, bordered
by the Forth.
North Queensferry is named after Queen Margaret, wife of Malcolm
Canmore, and has many historical buildings. The conservation village has
always been an important crossing point on the Forth. The Queens Ferry
started operating in the twelfth century and only closed in 1964 with
the opening of the road bridge.
Early pilgrims on their way to St Andrews were guaranteed free passage
on the ferry. In more recent times, North Queensferry served as a base
for smugglers.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison is quoting offers over #98,000.

SCOTTISH property prices fell by 3.8% during the three months to the
end of April, the third consecutive fall since the market topped in the
middle of last year, according to the TSB's quarterly Scottish House
Price Monitor. It confirms the experience of many estate agents and
builders who saw the market weaken in the autumn and winter months.
Such a seasonal drop is normal, and the TSB is optimistic that
increased activity might yet feed through into the statistics.
''So far, the normal spring effect has not yet been recorded in the
price index. However, the number of new mortgages in February, March and
April is showing an increase compared to the previous quarter,'' says
the report.
These slight falls in price have helped to bring the first-time buyers
back into the market. In the latest quarter some 46% of all new mortgage
transactions were for first time buyers, a 24% increase on last
quarter's figure. However, first-time buyers seem determined to purchase
only at keen prices.
Other good news from the index is that Scottish demand for houses is
increasing. The TSB predicts that the total number of Scottish
households will increase by 10.9% by the year 2006, producing a
requirement for a further 161,000 homes north of the Border.

KELVIN Homes Limited, now with an annual turnover of more than #6m,
had its beginnings when two Scots working on contracts in Saudi Arabia
spent an evening discussing how they would like to see their future
shape up.
They shared an ambition to go into business on their own. Later in
1983, when their contracts expired, they met again in Scotland. They
still had the same ambition. A few months later they established Kelvin
Homes Limited.
Bob Earlie, a quantity surveyor, is still managing director, and Terry
Walker, a joiner by trade, is development director. Their venture has an
established record of growth and success.
Mr Earlie has another achievement to his credit. Now chairman of St
Mirren football club -- one of Kelvin Homes' first office locations was
just a stone's throw from Love Street -- he has worked hard at giving
the Paisley team a sound new base and much enhanced facilities.
The small firm that was the beginning of Kelvin Homes was at first
mainly involved in home reconstruction and refurbishment work and
initially moved its offices as contracts required, relocating between
Edinburgh and Johnstone, Paisley and then Glasgow.
Much increased in size, in 1988 it finally moved to Calder Street,
Coatbridge, where today a staff of 30 occupy a modern office complex.
Seven site operations are controlled from there at the moment, with
another three due to start shortly.
Present work in progress underlines the fact that Kelvin does much
more than merely build homes. It has been involved in the upgrading and
extension of Dalmahoy Golf Clubhouse and extension work at Airth Castle
Hotel in Perthshire. In the Airth grounds, it has been involved, with
Woolwich Homes, in the development of 60 houses of various sizes.
Other future plans on an area of 40 acres owned at the Airth site
include the erection of around 40 luxury houses priced from #200,000
upwards, each with a garden of between one third and half an acre.
In another market sector, Kelvin is involved in conjunction with
Scottish Homes and Glasgow District Council in various housing projects.

KELVIN Homes Limited, active in the building industry throughout
central Scotland, has achieved the twin quality accreditation standards
of BS5750 part two and ISO9002. The firm sees this as part of its plan
for future healthy growth and a clear statement of the quality of its
products.
''It took a full 18 months of work to achieve,'' said David Gillespie,
company secretary, at the head office in Coatbridge. He acted as quality
manager throughout the process. ''Quite simply, the company decided that
as our activities had broadened in a way which gave equal prominence to
development work and house building, it was necessary to emphasise the
overall quality of our work. This was partly to ensure a continued
future prosperity and also to allow our name to be accepted on many
future outside tender lists. It was a deliberate part of our long-term
planning.''
In the few weeks since the building firm was notified of success, it
has received congratulations from customers and sub-contractors alike.
Managing director Bob Earlie said: ''We feel that this achievement
underlines the way in which we are able to handle major projects in a
totally professional manner. But at the same time the ordinary
housebuyer will also benefit because of the quality benefits which have
been brought into our techniques and our already high quality of
workmanship.''
Kelvin Homes carries out a wide range of development and construction
work, including hotels, houses and offices, in a wide area of central
Scotland from near Earlston in the Borders to Perthshire.
''We were guided along the quality accreditation path by the
Strathclyde Institute,'' said Mr Gillespie, who has been with the
company since 1988. ''Some things we decided to do in our own way
because of the scattered nature of our activities. One aspect we
reversed was the usual practice of having staff meetings first then
going on from there to draft the manuals of procedures. Instead, the
first draft of each section was written then sent out to all concerned.
We then brought everyone involved into the boardroom for a session and
invited them to tear the draft to bits.''
This approach, he feels, saved time and allowed maximum staff input.
''We continued that process throughout, with consultations involving all
of our workforce. Genuinely democratic decisions were arrived at by
consensus. Suggestions were welcomed from everyone.''
As quality manager, Mr Gillespie also gave priority to a series of
consultations with the firm's site managers. ''In fact almost everyone
was involved at some stage. As soon as a new set of procedures became
ready in draft form they would be sent out with a summons to meet in the
board room in exactly a week's time to discuss and debate. We also made
sure that everyone knew exactly what we were doing and why we were doing
it.''
He describes the process as containing no major surprises but
involving much hard work for many people. ''Then things began to fall
into place. As soon as we felt we had one procedure organised we set it
going, then if necessary we improved on it as a result of experience and
might produce another draft.''
First indications of solid results came from improved paperwork. Any
previous problems caused by lack of records or back-up in writing were
eliminated. An exact history of any situation became immediately
available.
''Today we do nothing without putting it in writing first and also
having it confirmed in writing. There is always a record and the result
is that any time there is a problem we can quickly locate where that
problem belongs. We produced new check sheets and tick sheets which make
sub-contractors much more answerable for the work they have done --
something that can be valuable when three different sets of
sub-contractors can be involved on some jobs.
''Now, under the same procedures we can see that our snagging lists of
faults to be repaired are smaller than ever, at the same time as we can
identify the cause more quickly than ever before. Just about every
aspect of our operation has new and tighter controls, and from the site
manager all the way down, everyone can see who was involved and what
went wrong.
''Customer complaints are down. They get a better product. At the same
time we ask customers to help us by putting any complaints they may have
in writing. When that happens, the written complaint becomes part of our
records and can be identified and dealt with in a more efficient way to
everyone's benefit.''
The procedures have brought many other benefits. ''We feel it was
worth all the work involved,'' Mr Gillespie said. ''Even more important
we can prove it.''

IT is difficult to be here in Vienna this week, in the sunshine, and
not to throw your mind back over the years to another European Cup
final.
For a Scot, there is an obvious comparison between the day in Lisbon
when Celtic defeated Inter-Milan and this year's collision between Ajax
and AC Milan.
There is the clash of opposing philosophies at the Ernst Happel
Stadium, just as there was back in 1967, and there is also the feeling
that Europe would like to see a victory for Ajax, just as they wanted to
see Inter beaten in Lisbon.
So we wonder if this will be the year for Ajax, the champions of
Holland, who have arrived here promising attacking football. Yesterday
there seemed to be a brashness about their players, a kind of innocent
confidence which reminded me of Celtic almost 30 years ago.
Their only problem will be if they become overawed by the occasion,
but yesterday they seemed as if they would be able to handle that.
Their coach, Louis Van Gaal, is determined that they will not be
affected by nerves. The 44-year-old, who has transformed the Dutch side,
asks: ''What should frighten us. We have beaten AC Milan in two games
already this season in the Champions' League. We beat them home and
away, 2-0 each time.
''Our players must keep these games in mind as they head into this
final. Obviously Milan have improved recently. Their results in Europe
and in their own league tell us that, but we cannot allow them to take a
psychological advantage.''
''This is the biggest game of the European season and that itself
demands that we give our best. I doubt, in any case, if my players could
play another way but offensively.''
Milan may not have shown their finest form this season as they
stuttered towards this final, but who can forget the way they defeated
Barcelona last year in that epic encounter.
The differences here run deeper than simply those of style. Van Gaal
has built his team mainly from a youth policy at the club while Milan
will always use their spending power to bring them success.
Tonight, Milan will rely on the men who have kept them at the top of
European football for so many years now. Franco Baresi and Paulo Maldini
will be the mainstays of defence. Marcel Desailly will be in midfield,
and the explosive Dejan Savicavic will be up front if he's fit.
Ajax, of course, will look to their 24-year-old Finn Jari Litmanen who
scored in each of their earlier games against the Italians. And they'll
expect great things from Clarence Seedorf who is 19, Marc Overmars at
22, and Finidi George, who is just 24.
Baresi, at 35, said: ''I missed last year's final because of
suspension, and we lost in 1993, and so it would be good for me at my
age to win this one.''
For experience, the Dutch will rely on veteran Frank Rijkaard who
spent glory years with Milan and will now be a major barrier to them as
he organises the young men around him.
If Milan win then they will equal Real Madrid's record of winning the
Champions Cup six times.
If Ajax win then perhaps Van Gaal can see his dream come true of
starting off a new era in European football. It is nice to think it
could happen, but somehow I see the resilience and the experience of the
Italians being too much for Ajax on the night.

What's in a Name. The answer -- in the City of London, at least --
used to be plenty of money and the confident expectation of plenty more
to come.
Now, the answer is huge personal losses for thousands who have turned
to the courts for retribution.
Names at Lloyd's are individuals who pledge their wealth to the market
to underwrite insurance risks -- down to their last shirt button or
hairpin.
For hundreds of years little went wrong with the money-spinning
system, which gave them the chance to invest their money twice over.
Although promised to the market, the money was rarely called upon and
could be used elsehwere to earn interest. At the end of the year,
another cheque arrived from Lloyd's when the profits from premiums were
shared out.
In the booming 1980s, when a new generation enjoyed the spoils of the
market economy unleashed by Margaret Thatcher, Lloyd's became a
fashionable place for the new rich to become even richer.
In 1986 Lloyd's made an overall profit of almost #650m to be
distributed among some 30,000-plus grateful Names.
Because insruance claims can take a long time to materialise and to be
settled, Lloyd's publishes its figures three years in arrears, and by
the time the record surplus of 1986 was trumpeted in 1989 the whole
edifice had crumbled.
The influx of new money had been used by the market professionals to
chase dubious high-risk business, the economic bubble was about to burst
and an unprecedented series of natural and man-made disasters sent
claims soaring.
A #509m profit in 1987 became a loss of equal magnitude within just a
year -- and there was worse to come. Lloyd's plunged more than #2000m
into the red in 1989, lost almost #3000m in 1990 and another #2000m in
1991.
It is a far cry from the first mention of Lloyd's which appeared in
the late 1680s as an advert in the London Gazette offering a reward for
information about stolen watches.
The money could be claimed from Edward Lloyd's Coffee Shop where
ships' captains, merchants and shipowners would gather and exchange
gossip. Edward Lloyd soon built up a reputation for reliable shipping
news and his coffee shop became recognised as the best place to obtain
marine insurance.
A policy to insure ships and their cargoes would be hawked around the
City of London until someone with enough money was found to share the
risk in return for some of the premium.
An Act of Parliament in the eighteenth century granted two insurance
company charters but did not stop the underwriting activities of
individuals who traditionally gave their names to policies.
These people, usually merchants, would pledge all their wealth as
security to meet a claim and Lloyd's present system of Names is thought
to date from this omission by Parliament.
In 1769 some of Lloyd's more reputable customers broke away and set up
a rival establishment nearby but this soon proved too small and 79 of
them paid #100 each into the Bank of England to find new premises.
In 1774 rooms were leased in the Royal Exchange, the coffee house days
were over and the seeds of the modern Lloyd's were sewn.
The insurance market became a pillar of the City of London and one of
its main sources of overseas earnings, as well as a reliable
income-provider for Names from both Britain and abroad.
Lloyd's gained a reputation for honesty and fair dealing and to this
day has never failed to pay out on a justified claim.
The honest tradition was shattered in the 1970s in a series of
scandals in which a number of market professionals syphoned off
premiums, some escaping justice by fleeing the country.
Lloyd's weeded out the criminal element and kept the profits flowing
until the start of its current troubles, which eerily coincided with a
hurricane in 1987 which swept across the south of England causing
millions of pounds of damage and triggered a storm of insurance claims.
A string of expensive disasters followed, including the San Francisco
earthquake, the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in the North Sea and the
Exxon Valdez oil tanker spillage in Alaska.
Traditionally sedate annual meetings of Names turned into heated
affairs in which the increasingly irate Names revolted against the
ruling council and accused their agents and advisers of incompetence and
even fraud.
At the heart of the escalating problems facing Names was the unique
Lloyd's system of unlimited liability, by which there was -- in theory
-- no end to how deep they must dig into their pockets to meet claims.
Apart from the ill-fated offer of #900m to settle outstanding
compensation claims and draw a line under long-term risks, Lloyd's this
year introduced corporate membership for the first time.
Newly-created investment vehicles were quick to spring up, free of the
burden of past claims, confident that the run of costly disasters could
not recur and that the insurance cycle has turned in their favour.
There is money to be made at Lloyd's again, they believe, and they
have the revolutionary advantage at Lloyd's of being blessed with
corporate limited liability. You can only lose what you invest in one of
these new companies.

NIGEL Mansell's stop-start comeback to Formula One with Malboro
McLaren Mercedes ended yesterday after just two races, and the
announcement of the termination of his agreement with the team looks
like the chequered flag to his grand prix career.
The 41-year-old former world champion will be replaced by
fellow-Briton Mark Blundell for this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix.
Mansell's future has been in doubt since he missed the season's
opening two races, after having complained the cockpit of his car was
too small.
It forced McLaren to invest a further #350,000 in their #50m Formula
One challenge by redesigning the cockpit to accommodate Mansell's
12-stone frame. But he struggled to finish tenth on his #7m comeback
race in San Marino, and lasted just 18 laps in Barcelona. He said he
needed a few more races to be competitive.
Team managing-director Ron Dennis confirmed: ''The performance of the
1995 Formula One car, MP4/10, has not met the expectations of both
parties so far this year. Nigel has not felt confident within the car
and this has affected his ability to commit fully to the programme.
''In these circumstances, I believe that we have determined the most
appropriate course of action. The relationship has been short and has
obviously not achieved the results anticipated by either party.''

NO replacement has been found for the Glenfiddich International indoor
tournament, but enthusiasts in the West will have the finals of the
European Nations Cup to watch at the Kelvin Hall, Glasgow, from January
26 to 28.
Germany, the best hockey country around, will be well represented, but
Scotland, silver and bronze medallists in 1981 and '90, again will be
among the contenders for a minor medal. Draw:
Group A -- Germany, Scotland, France, Denmark. Group B -- England,

IT MAY seem an incongruous reflection of the game in Scotland, but
Airdrie, who had their last practice game on a public park, fancy their
chances of beating Celtic in front of 40,000 folk at Hampden in the cup
final on Saturday. In fact, their manager, Alex MacDonald, believes his
main task is to calm his men down, rather than work them up for the
biggest single day in the season.
Airdrie, the homeless wonders of the Scottish game, do their training
in the wide open spaces of Strathclyde Park where there is room for
everything bar a sense of self-importance. MacDonald worries about the
wait between now and kick-off time. The risk of injury or illness may be
small but he would hate to see any player knocked out of contention at
this stage.
It was for that reason that he cut short the side's final bounce game
against the reserves last weekend. ''Two of the amateurs were taken off
injured, it was so competitive, and I was a bit worried. I decided to
call a halt.''
MacDonald loved it, none the less. ''That is the way it should be and
it showed that some of the reserves fancied their chances of getting a
place in the team. I was frightened somebody got sent off and missed the
final. Incidentally, the cup final side got beat 2-0.''
The Airdrie manager intends to have all his candidates treated with
every care now as the big moment arrives and there will be no
particularly strenuous work done at their seaside base later in the
week. The practice games were mainly to assist players who have been out
recently, particularly Kenny Black, the former Hearts man.
He and the rest are looking and feeling well and it is now the
manager's job to pick the team he thinks can complete a unique first
division double, following Raith Rovers' win in the Coca Cola Cup.
Meanwhile, Celtic's gaffer, Tommy Burns, reported that optimism
continues to grow regarding their injured players, Peter Grant, Andy
Walker and Brian O'Neil. Grant trained yesterday, Walker seems fully
recovered and O'Neil, although missing training, is a lot better after
suffering a twisted knee in a work-out on Monday.

SCOTLAND will proceed with caution for their opening RWC match against
Ivory Coast at Rustenburg on Friday.
The side chosen to meet the Elephants, with its blend of what must be
interpreted as the first-choice back division allied to some unusual
combinations in the forwards, reflects the management view that the
first game of a World Cup campaign is not the time for largesse with
caps being awarded to fringe players just for the sake of it.
Nevertheless, with Tonga and France still to come in the pool
qualification stages, Ivory Coast represents the easiest game in the
section and offers the best chance for players such as Jeremy Richardson
and, in particular, Cameron Glasgow, who still seeks that elusive first
cap, to stake claims in their own right for preferment later on.
They are just two of maybe half a dozen players for whom the opening
game -- injuries aside -- represents the optimum opportunity for posting
a wee reminder to selectors.
Additionally, pitching in the big guns -- certainly in the back
division -- against the Ivory Coast opens up the prospect of the top
players having little respite as the games get harder throughout
qualification and into the quarter-finals.
The selection of Tony Stanger and Graham Shiel as the centre
combination indicates that Scott Hastings and Ian Jardine -- both of
whom are on the bench for Friday -- have slipped down the pecking order.
Probably, as against Romania when he replaced injured brother Gavin,
Scott Hastings provides cover for full back.
Team manager Duncan Paterson would not be drawn on whether the
Stanger-Shiel combination was now the recognised first-choice line-up in
midfield.
''They are for this game. The selection that we have gone for
represents, in our opinion, a strong international side to play the
Ivory Coast.
''We have chosen a very experienced side. All of these players are
experienced internationalists now and this is our strongest side for
this type of game. We don't underestimate the Ivory Coast. It may be
that we could have made more changes but if we had got it wrong then I
am sure that we would have been criticised, and rightly so.''
The front row combination of Burnell, McKenzie, and Wright is
unexpected in that it has Burnell at loose-head, on the left of the
scrummage, whereas his normal slot is on the tight-head.
The London Scot is not, though, an absolute stranger to the berth,
having played on the loose-head for Scotland against Zimbabwe in the
1991 World Cup when David Sole was unavailable due to injury.
Regular first-choice loose-head prop David Hilton has been recovering
from an ankle injury sustained in training, but team manager Duncan
Paterson stressed yesterday that all 26 players had been passed fit.
''Everybody was available for selection, including David, but it will
do him no harm to have another few days,'' said Paterson.
The back-row selection, which plays together for the first time,
offers another talking point. Peter Walton, who was one of the
walking-wounded who underwent intensive physiotherapy on an injured knee
at the Lilleshall Sports Medicine Centre, makes his comeback to the side
on the blindside flank with the erstwhile out-of-favour Ian Smith on the
openside.
More significantly, Rob Wainwright plays at No.8 instead of his
regular international position on the flank.
Paterson said that fielding the army doctor, who has played for
Scotland as a replacement lock, four times at No.8 and eight times as
flanker, at the base of the scrummage was being done ''to give him a bit
of experience and to give us further options later on if they are
required.''
Wainwright was in the wars at training yesterday, having five stitches
inserted in a cut above the right eye but he will, according to the
medics, be as right as rain for Friday.
For Walton, the recall to the Scotland colours represents a timely
recovery from injury to the tendons of the right patella.
''I was operated on last October. They said I would be out for six
weeks but the damage was worse than they expected and I was out for six
months. I played my first game, for Northampton against Gala, the day
before the Calcutta Cup match.
''After the injury I thought that I would struggle to get back but I
am fitter than I have ever been. Now that I've got a game out here I
have to take my chance. If I do then, you never know, they might stick
with me.''
Ivory Coast are very much the mystery side of the tournament. They
have not been impressive at training but they still qualified from the
African Zone play-offs at the expense of more favoured sides like
Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Morocco.
Paterson said that he had been present in Casablanca for the Morocco
game and that they had studied videos of the Elephants in action since
then.
The Ivoriennes have a reputation for volatility and indiscipline, but
the manager said that no special instructions would be issued to the
Scotland side.
''I would like to think that Scotland always have a very responsible
attitude on the field and it will be no different against Ivory Coast,''
he said.
Despite management caution, victory over the Ivoriennes must be taken,
almost, for granted. That being the case the manner of victory is as
important, if not more so, than the win itself.
To which end, Scotland must display a degree of ruthlessness that was
missing from their warm-up win over Madrid in Spain earlier this month.
It was a sentiment with which Paterson agreed. ''We have never made any
secret of the fact that if we aspire to be among the top six sides in
the world then we must acquire that ruthlessness,'' he said.
Scotland team:
A G Hastings (Watsonians); C A Joiner (Melrose), A G Stanger (Hawick),
A G Shiel (Melrose), K M Logan (Stirling County); C M Chalmers, B W
Redpath (both Melrose); A P Burnell (London Scottish), K D McKenzie

TERRY Venables, the England manager, has made it a little more
difficult for Rangers, or any other club, to complete negotiations for
the #4.5m transfer of Lazio's Paul Gascoigne -- and again strongly
denied that he had advised against the former Tottenham player moving to
Glasgow.
Venables also has put damper on the expected transfers of Nottingham
Forest striker Stan Collymore and Wimbledon defender Warren Barton,
unless the three players can sort out their futures within six days.
If nothing is settled within that time, transfers will have to be put
on ice for another fortnight, because the England manager will ban
agents from the training camp from the moment his squad assembles on
Monday, through to the conclusion of the Umbro Cup on June 11.
This has come as a heavy blow to Gascoigne, who is reported to be
nowhere near resolving his parting settlement from Lazio, or concluding
transfer talks with a host of hopeful British clubs.
Leslie Silver, chairman of Leeds, has said that he is set to meet the
recalled England player later this week to try to convince him that
Elland Road, rather than Rangers, Chelsea, Villa, or Everton is where he
should end up.
But yesterday Venables again countered claims that he has tried to
influence Gascoigne's transfer direction away from Glasgow towards
England. ''I've never done that,'' he said. ''The only one who knows
that is Gazza himself. He spoke to me and I said, 'I'm happy if you're
happy -- wherever you are, I can see you play regularly and keep checks
on you. It makes no difference to me whatsoever.'''
Everton also have tabled a #7m bid for Forest striker Collymore, while
Newcastle head the queue for Wimbledon's Barton. But Venables does not
want any distractions once his squad is closeted next week. ''Nothing
will happen during that tournament -- it's either got to be settled
before or after,'' he said.
England take a familiar walk into the unknown next month with the
return of Gascoigne for the Umbro Cup against world champions Brazil and
Sweden, plus Japan from June 3-11. After just two competitive matches in
the year since a broken leg with Lazio again threatened his career, not
even the England manager knows what he is getting.
And he has warned Gascoigne that if he is not up to scratch, he will
be just as quickly dumped from a 22-man squad which also features the
return of Blackburn's David Batty.

THE draw for this week's Women's World Doubles Cup at the
Craiglockhart Tennis and Sports Centre in Edinburgh has not been kind to
national champions Julie Pullin and Lorna Woodroffe. The teenage wild
cards will face second seeds Manon Bollegraf and Rennae Stubbs in one of
today's two quarter-final ties.
Ranked 247 and 282 respectively, Pullin and Woodroffe can expect a
fiery baptism in the $160,000 event as the Dutch/Australian pairing,
ranked eight and 26, were semi-finalists in last week's Italian Open in
Rome and runners up in the Open Gaz de France in Paris in February.
Today's order of play (2pm):
P Fendick and J Hetherington v N Arendt and L Golarsa followed by J
Lloyd and T Austin v R Taylor and W Turnbull followed by J Pullin and L
Woodroffe v M Bollegraf and R Stubbs followed by R Emerson and J Durie v
J Kreik and V Wade.
* NEWLANDS captain Malcolm Watt has made one change to his team for
today's away clash with defending champions Castle Farm in the Premier
Division of the Everest and National Club League.
The Glasgow side, beaten 4-2 by the David Lloyd Club, Bushey, and 5-1
by Banbury West End over the weekend, have retained Jason Barnett, Watt
and Euan McGinn for the top three singles but have brought in former
Scottish junior champion Calum McKnight to replace Ronnie Terras at
No.4.
Newlands require to win one of their three remaining fixtures to
retain their place in next year's event.

STIRLING County will celebrate winning the Scottish title with a match
next season against the Barbarians.
The match -- which will be sponsored -- will go ahead at Bridgehaugh
on Tuesday, September 26.
It will be only the second time that the Baa-Baas have played against
a Scots club side, the last occasion being in 1988 in a game against
Glasgow Accies.
''We were delighted to accept the invite, marking Stirling's
incredible progress through the leagues,'' said Barbarians president,
Micky Steele-Bodger.
He added that while the side will contain a number of internationals
from around the world, he could not speculate on the make-up of the team
given that a number of the players will have been on World Cup duty, and
that the season in both hemispheres is underway at that time.
Temporary stands will be erected for the occasion, which could take
the capacity at Bridgehaugh in excess of 10,000, with an invite having
already been extended to the Scottish Rugby Union patron, the Princess
Royal.

CAPE Town is one of the world's most beautiful cities, sited where the
Atlantic meets the Indian Ocean in a crescendo of colour and beauty. All
nestling under the watchful gaze of a mist-shrouded Table Mountain.
And the only Scots here to view it, like two wee boys in a sweetie
shop, are me and Roy Laidlaw.
But, looking like the kings they are at the foot of the great plateau
are the Australians, just a Michael Lynagh punt from Newlands itself,
the defending champions, who have their PR effort in full swing to
complement a city that is going rugby mad.
There are flags, posters, and adverts every two yards proclaiming the
opening game between the hosts and the holders.
What Roy Laidlaw has learned about the Aussies so far is staggering.
John Eales, their second row, practices jumping with a specially
weighted jersey.
They take contact with full suits of lightweight body armour
surrounding the defenders, and many of their skills practices come from
net ball. All hands, hands, hands.
Lynagh, their personable captain, gave up some of his time as he and
his team built up for the world's biggest match.
There were no worries despite David Campese having missed the session
with a heavy cold, and Jason Little saving a hamstring.
''Put it this way,'' said Lynagh. ''Yes there is a lot of pressure,
but I would rather be the top dog, and defending champions, than having
to prove ourselves as second raters.
''That is just the kind of people we are. This game is the biggest
event in all of our lives, and I compare it to the game when we played
the Boks over here in '92.''
Aussie coach Bob Dwyer hinted that the South Africans were holding
something up their sleeves -- all of their sessions have been
closed-door affairs -- while Kitch Christie, the South African manager,
said he thought that the Australians were favourites.
''I think that they are the best side,'' he said ''But if I were
England then I would pick Neil Back, and then they would have one of the
best teams in the world. I believe England could be real contenders.
''Meanwhile, against South Africa earlier this year I was shocked at
the way they played,'' he added. ''But they turned it around for the
Five Nations' with that win in France, and I also think that Gavin
Hastings can make his men achieve great things.
''That try of his in Paris was wonderful. This World Cup will depend
on many things, including the will to win, and it depends on how much
Scotland wants to win.''
An obvious question was whether strong commitment could continue
within the bounds of amateurism. Campese, for instance, is said to be
about to benefit from a testimonial match from his club Down Under.
''Put it this way, I have no real job but I have two consultancies,''
said Lynagh, who has spent much of his career playing in Italy. ''I hope
that at the end of my career, I can develop these opportunities into
full-time employment, but just now, with our time commitment, that is
impossible. And the demands will get greater.''
It's easy to see the strength of his argument as every word that's
uttered in this part of the world is about rugby, the upcoming clash,
the stage that is about to be set, and any other topic you care to
mention as long as it is about rugby.
On the plane over here there were groups of Scots, Welsh, New
Zealanders, and English forgoing sleep on an arduous 11-hour flight to
discuss the up and coming competition.
Even Lynagh, the captain of Australia for goodness sake, would have
talked about rugby all day if he had the chance. ''The All Blacks are
ominous with their lack of profile,'' he said. ''I find it all very
exiting, and the best bit for me is to see the youngsters coming through
in this squad.
''Yes, it's pressure, but we have to learn to relax as well.''
Presumably the ubiquitous psychologist helps them to so that too.
With that it was time for goodbye. ''Hope you boys do well,'' he said.
We'll pass the sentiment on if we get the chance. It's rugby fever here
in the Souther Hemisphere.

THE Canadians must be taking this World Cup really seriously because
they have decided to take the pledge throughout the tournament -- yes,
they have actually banned alcohol.
However, by way of a little compensation, coach Ian Birtwell has put
the emphasis on relaxation and joviality ahead of Friday's Pool A match
against Romania in Port Elizabeth.
''We encourage the players to get out and look around,'' said the
coach. ''We don't want an oppressive atmosphere in the camp. ''We
haven't set any curfews because the players are professional enough in
their approach not to need any. They've even imposed their own ban on
drinking alcohol from now on through the tournament.
''Once we really get into the World Cup there will be little time to
enjoy ourselves. So we are doing it now.''
But while the Canadians might be enjoying themselves off the field,
there has been no frivolity in training. ''In fact, it's been pretty
intense and hotly contested,'' added Birtwell. ''It's like we've played
two games already. I think we're going to have to cool it down a little.
The great thing about this team is that they get on so well. They enjoy
getting together and they enjoy each other's company.
* AUSTRALIAN backs David Campese and Jason Little have been passed fit
to play in tomorrow's opening match against South Africa in Cape Town.
Campese, still the most dangerous attacking back in the world, had
been suffering from a cold, but is certain to take his place, while
Little, who is an integral part of the world champions' line-up,
strained his upper left leg at practice.
* FRANCE have selected Aubin Hueber at scrum-half ahead of Guy
Accoceberry for their opening match against Tonga in Pretoria on Friday.
Lock Olivier Brouzet, who injured an ankle in training, was passed fit
and will take his place in the second row alongside Olivier Merle.
''Hueber has been impressive in training and we thought he deserved a
chance,'' said French manager Guy Laporte. ''Those first two matches,
against opponents we must not under-rate but who seem relatively weaker
than we are, will allow us to find out who the best players are before
the Scotland match.''
* WALES faced their first injury worry yesterday when No.8 Stuart
Davies was forced to sit out a tough scrummaging session against the
Orange Free State pack in Bloemfontein.
Davies strained a neck muscle and was forced to look on as the home
pack gave the Welsh their first taste of live scrummaging on the hard,
South African grounds.
Weles coach Alex Evans said his players had adjusted well to the
different requirements and added that prop John Davies also was
suffering from a pinched nerve in his neck. Both players will be having
manipulation and neither is ruled out of Wales's opening Pool C clash
with Japan on Saturday.
The Welsh have placed the accent on defence as they prepare for their
opening game. ''We need to remind the players that the Japanese will be
coming from them in all directions,'' Evans said.

DAVID Huish fought through the pain barrier at Blackwell yesterday to
move into contention after the first round of the inaugural Ben
Sayers/ProQuip Senior Club Professional Golf Championship.
The 51-year-old North Berwick stalwart carded a one-under-par 69 at
the tree-line Worcestershire course to sit three behind leader Tommy
Horton, but revealed a shoulder injury should have kept him away.
''I was lifting some heavy boxes at home a couple of weeks ago and I
felt something go in my left shoulder. It's so sore now that I can
hardly raise my arm at all and I can't play without painkillers,'' said
Huish.
Horton, the 53-year-old Ryder Cup veteran, dropped a shot at the
448-yard third hole after driving into a water hazard, leading him
thereafter to opt for a No.2 ron or No.3 wood from the tee. He then had
four birdies and an eagle on the 6212-yard course. Leading scores:
66 -- T Horton (Royal Jersey).
68 -- T Squires (Boston).
69 -- P Leonard (Dunmurry), D Huish (North Berwick).
70 -- B Huggett (retired), D Butler (Coombe Wood).
Other Sottish scores: 71 -- D Craik (Frilford Heath), J McAlister
(Haggs Castle). 73 -- G Gray (Dumfries &amp; County), J Hamilton (Brickendon
Grange), S Murray (Hendon). 74 -- D Mills (Crieff). 76 -- I Smith
(Hazlehead). 77 -- J Hume (Gullane), A Gauld (Germany), M Moir
(Hamilton), M McCrorie (Strathaven). 78 -- G Will (London). 83 -- J
Steven (Glasgow).

PENTIRE was the star of a 1048-1 treble for Michael Hills yesterday
when the colt claimed his third classic trial of the season with victory
in the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood.
Not entered in the Derby, he added to his growing stature over middle
distances with a determined display to clinch the listed prize by a
short head from Istidaad.
Pentire is now set to contest the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal
Ascot or the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp next month.
Hills landed the opener on First Island and completed a fine afternoon
by taking the Anne Frances Stevens Memorial Handicap on Pay Homage.

* A CROSSING at the pull-up area at Goodwood almost halted the
progress of Wisam after the colt had won at the Sussex track yesterday.
Injury was just averted when the two-year-old leapt the path and lost
balance and composure at the end of the maiden event.
Jockey Walter Swinburn, who rode the winner, said: ''He jumped the
road on the pull-up. It's completely bare. For a nice two-year-old like
this, it's not on. You don't meet it on the level, you're going down
hill. Thank God for my hunting days and I was able to see a stride.''

Japan
DESPITE the fact that his team ended up with only nine players on the
field, Craig Brown was honest enough to admit that Sunday's performance
in the goalless draw with Japan in their opening Kirin Cup match in
Hiroshima was ''acceptable but not brilliant''.
The Scotland football manager is therefore under no illusions that a
better show, and particularly a more decisive result, must be achieved
in the second and final match of the competition against Ecuador in
Toyama today.
Hearts striker John Robertson will be given another chance to prove
that he has the quality required at international level. He will be
alongside his capital rival Darren Jackson in attack.
Brown would not indicate whether Robertson was being given a final
international chance, but it may be surmised that at the age of 31, and
having been posted missing from the squad for two years, he does not
have many more opportunities. The one thing which could cause Brown to
pick him again would be if he could score against Ecuador.
''We have been extremely impressed as always by John's attitude since
his return to the group. He has complemented Darren Jackson well, and
you sense that they are going to click but you never really know until
they play a full game together,'' said Brown.
''They were on the field at the same time on Sunday, but Jackson went
back into midfield after John Spencer was sent off. Hopefully, we will
get something from our strikers against Ecuador and if Jackson and
Robertson are electric, then they could play themselves in for the
European Championship tie in the Faroe Islands next month.''
Meanwhile, Alex Miller, the Hibernian manager who is with the squad as
Brown's assistant, refused to comment on recent speculation concerning
Jackson, who is out of contract this summer. ''We had preliminary talks
which went well, and we will talk again when we get home. No-one has
asked me about Darren Jackson's availability,'' he insisted.
Brown makes two alterations to the team which drew with Japan. The
atrocious tackle which caused severe bruising to Rob McKinnon's left
knee means the Motherwell defender will sit this one out among the
substitutes, with Derek Whyte, the former Celtic defender, assuming his
role.
Paul Bernard of Oldham will be asked to keep an eye on Ecuador's
play-maker with the result that Paul Lambert, who made his debut but was
substituted in the first half on Sunday, is left out this time.
''There is no reason to beat about the bush. He did not play as well
as I had hoped in the first half on Sunday,'' said Brown.
Scotland must record a victory if they are to have any hope of winning
the trophy although nothing will be decided until the last game on
Saturday between Ecuador and the host country.

NIGEL Mansell has almost certainly donned the human billboard livery
of the Formula One driver for the last time. McLaren Mercedes managing
director Ron Dennis announced yesterday that he has terminated Mansell's
contract, suggesting the Englishman will never extend a career which
brought 31 victories from 187 Grands Prix.
The new young legion of four-wheeled gladiators, like Scot David
Coulthard, who are prepared to gamble their lives for much less than the
asking price of multi-millionaire Mansell, will ensure that.
Mansell doubtless entertained thoughts of a glorious farewell before
his fans at the British Grand Prix, but a new contract with a
second-rate, non-competitive car, holds no attraction for a man whose
ego and confidence was always as supercharged as the cars he drove.
With at least #1m for each of his 41 years, and homes dotted around
the globe's more exotic locations, to which he can fly by private jet,
he has nothing left to prove. Perhaps it is these years, and the cushion
of that fortune and lifestyle, which have made the cockpit even less
comfortable than the Marlborough one which had to be redesigned this
year to accommodate his 12-stone frame.
Predictably, Mansell kept the door open last night, refusing to
speculate about his future. ''I have no immediate plans in Formula One,
but have welcomed the opportunity to keep in touch with the team, with
whom I have parted on the best possible terms,'' he said.
''I'm obviously disappointed that the relationship with McLaren and
Mercedes, which could have achieved so much, has been concluded early.''
One always suspected that a second-coming by the Messiah of British
motorsport, after his defection to IndyCar racing in an unseemly dash
for cash, would be one miracle too many.
For all his talents, for all the vast numbers who worship him -- and
would continue to do so even if he drove a tractor -- and despite his
comeback win after his Indy flirtation, Mansell flattered to deceive.
True, he won the world title, in 1992, breaking Jackie Stewart's
19-year British record of 27 GP successes. But he won just one world
title. Stewart won three, and Jim Clark two.
Nobody, however, could ever question his commitment. Mansell broke his
neck in 1977, and was told he might not drive again. He discharged
himself from hospital, and sold his house to fund his career. On his F1
debut, in a Lotus, in 1980, his engine blew up and he suffered severe
burns.
It took another five years to win his first GP, at Brands Hatch. The
following year he took the chequered flag six times, but it was the
consistency of Alain Prost, with just three wins, which took the title
from him by two points. And in 1987, he was runner-up again, despite
winning six races compared to only three by champion Nelson Piquet.
Commendably, Mansell took the IndyCar title at the first attempt,
surviving a 170mph crash in the process. He returned from Indy racing
with a bang at the end of last season, winning the final GP in Adelaide
in a Williams-Renault. It was to be his last victory, on the scene of
the blow-out finale to the 1986 season which cost him the world title.
The writing was on the wall this year for him to read when Williams,
with whom he won the drivers' championship, opted for the promise of
Coulthard as partner to Damon Hill.
But Mansell signed a #5m deal with McLaren on the eve of the season,
only to hit immediately the cockpit problems that saw Blundell replace
him for the races in Brazil and Argentina.
Like Steve Davis at his peak, Mansell is boring -- relieved only by
the consumate perfection of their ability to win. Ability gone, the grey
mist of anonimity descends. At least Mansell, unlike many of his
forebears, has got out with a fortune, and his body intact.
Stay away, Nigel, and smell the roses.

matter over to the sport's governing body.
All Welsh clubs who do not play in the national league -- the Konica

SCOTLAND'S grand prix champions, Barry Sutherland and Claire Waddell,
have set new targets. Sutherland hopes to travel to tournaments in
England in a bid to represent Scotland in the world championships in
November.
He has played for his country as the fifth string in the European
championship. But, with only four selected for the worlds, he realises
he faces a stiff task to clinch a place.
Waddell is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Frank Ellis and Derek
Ritchie by taking up a sports scholarship at Stirling University. She
has decided to complete her education before turning to the professional
circuit.
''I've enjoyed mixing a course at Aberdeen College with squash,'' said
Claire. ''I would still like to play as a professional, but I'll wait a
few years when, hopefully, there will be bit more money in the women's
game.''
Her main target next season is to retain the Scottish title, and she
also is looking forward to a debut appearance in the European Champion
of Champions, an event in October.

JACK Holt can underline his skill in handling sprinters by taking the
Goodwood Park Hotel Stakes today with Sweet Magic.
The trainer came within half a length of landing the Stewards' Cup
over this afternoon's course and distance with Duplicity in 1992, and
could well be eyeing another tilt at that race with Sweet Magic.
The gelding improved last year and on his reappearance at Sandown was
caught only close home by Brave Edge who went on to frank the form with
success at York.
Holt's runners invariably improve for an outing and Sweet Magic will
be very hard to catch this time.
The Tripleprint Lupe Stakes is trickier, but Mandarina may prove the
better value bet to continue Luca Cumani's fine recent run.
Badly hampered when sixth behind Subya at Kempton last month, she will
be very well suited by this step up to a mile and a quarter.
Much-improved Bollin Harry is the best bet at Newcastle in the
Brunswick Handicap. The colt was a revelation on his reappearance,
outsprinting 18 rivals with a dash which belied his modest first-season
form.
The claimer looks competitive but most of them are out of form and
punters could do worse than take a chance on Captain Starlight off a
lowish weight.

ENGLAND launch another new era at Trent Bridge today -- but, for once,
the spotlight will be on their opponents. Keith Fletcher has carried the
can for last winter's Ashes tour and Ray Illingworth now is running the
nets as well as selection meetings.
But the main issue at the start of this summer is whether or not the
West Indies are ready to again be blown away. The first of three Texaco
Trophy internationals will not provide an answer, even if England make
it seven straight one-day wins over the men from the Caribbean.
But a home victory would strengthen the suspicion that Richie
Richardson's team are no longer a force to be frightened of in any form
of cricket.
They lost their first Test series for 15 years, beaten 2-1 at home by
Australia. And the form of Richardson and fast bowler Curtly Ambrose
during the early days of this tour has been far from encouraging.
England will not finalise their team until the morning, but with Mark
Ramprakash having overcome a hamstring strain, the likeliest discards
from a squad of 13 are Alan Wells and Peter Martin.
The tourists could give fast bowler Ian Bishop his first international
appearance for two years following a long fight against serious back
injury. But whatever their line-up, Richardson's message to his men will
be clear: ''We have a better record, have been playing better cricket,
and I think we are the better team,'' he insisted.

SCOTLAND'S Formula One driver, David Coulthard, may have moved to the
south of France but he has not forgotten his roots and will front a
racing team which he believes could produce other drivers capable of
following him on to the grand prix circuit.
The 24-year-old Williams driver took time out this week from his
preparations for the Monaco Grand Prix this weekend to launch the
Highland Spring Kart Team, which will be based in Lanarkshire where
Coulthard himself learned how to drive.
Highland Spring have been one of his personal sponsors since 1992 and
he is especially pleased they have decided to back the karting team with
which he started.
The team will be run by Dave Boyce Engineering, who also taught
Coulthard and who remains one of the Williams driver's confidants.
''I am sure their support of the kart team will help bring through
more drivers,'' Coulthard said as he examined the team's new karts with
two of Britain's most promising junior drivers, brothers John and Ryan
Dalziel, who were given time off from Glasgow Academy to assist with the
launch.
''Dave Boyce knows how to get the best out of young drivers and his
team has always had about it a good family atmosphere,'' Coulthard said.
''He will do well with the young drivers he has at the moment and I
fully intend to spend as much time with them as I can.
''If they want to say I am the figurehead of their team that would
please me, but I must admit that they can help me also.
''It may sound strange, but someone like me who is operating at the
pinnacle of the sport can go back to the grassroots level and still
learn.
''It might be something in the technique of one of the young drivers
or it could be in the way one of them thinks.
''This will be a two-way thing and I am just pleased to be able to
help out with the people who gave me my start.
''It's important, I think, for sportsmen and women who reach the top
to remember where they came from.''
Coulthard's father, Duncan, of Hayton Coulthard Haulage, also is a
sponsor of the kart team as is John Dalziel, father of John (12) and
Ryan (16), who is also jersey sponsor of Scottish Cup finalists Airdrie.

WHEN commercial vehicle magazines arrange a road test, they can
usually find some normal work for the van or truck to tackle.
Non-specialist publications have to scratch around for an appropriate
task, which is how I found myself, wondering if I needed my head
examined, driving a Toyota Hiace Compact van up the Rest and be
Thankful, delivering a piano to the Sound of Jura.
Toyota is a giant of the passenger car business, but it is also very
strong in the commercial market. Last year's worldwide sales of more
than two million Toyotas included almost a quarter of that number of
vans, trucks and buses. Some are built in Germany and Portugal, and a
rather arcane fact about the world motor industry is that Toyota is the
biggest manufacturer of fork-lifts.
Until recently Toyota's panel van range consisted of the Hiace and the
much smaller Liteace. The Hiace Compact is effectively a short-wheelbase
version of the former design, but it is unexpectedly roomy, with a very
good load platform area and a 1280kg payload. Its price of #9558 before
VAT actually undercuts the Liteace, even though the Compact is fitted
with a more powerful 2.4-litre diesel engine.
Vans need to be easy to manoeuvre, load and unload, particularly in
confined spaces. The Compact does the business here, with a two-stage
opening top-hinged rear door, and a sliding nearside loading door which
gives plenty of room to ease in bulky items.
Things like pianos cannot be allowed to slide around inside a van,
especially one being driven along the winding roads of Argyll. Tie-down
hooks are provided on the load floor. There are hardboard liners to
protect the load area sides, but I am always surprised that vans so
rarely come with a floor covering other than painted metal.
As for manoeuvring, the smaller Hiace does that well, both in normal
traffic and when shunting around its pick-up or delivery areas. The crew
sit over the engine, and level with the front wheels. Despite the safety
considerations which have given it slightly more front-end bodywork than
it actually needs, the Compact does not have anything really
recognisable as a bonnet. That, combined with its deep windscreen and
tight turning circle, means the front end can be edged right up to any
obstruction in front, while the big door mirrors and generous rear
window provide plenty of visibility for reversing.
There is a proper walk-in interior, with steps at all doors, and grab
handles are well placed to let the crew heave themselves into the seats.
On the move, the Compact is quiet enough at its comfortable cruising
speed, but when you wind it up on a motorway the noise levels are
unavoidably high.
With a peak output of 76bhp and a healthy spread of torque, the
2.4-litre diesel engine is a stalwart performer. It keeps the Compact
well up with normal traffic, lets it attack gradients with little
likelihood of fading away, and yet offers plenty of flexibility so that
the driver is not always hunting around the clonky gear linkage -- just
like a Toyota saloon's -- for lower ratios in traffic or on hills.
Well loaded, assuming that the load is sensibly spread, the Compact
handles reassuringly well, although in that state liberties cannot be
taken with cornering speeds. It remains generally very stable, if
susceptible to crosswinds.
On the return trip, with two people and no cargo on board, the Compact
went and handled with surprising vigour. I begin to understand why on
their back-to-base journeys so many vans are driven in a really sporting
manner.
It would be a good lesson in manners for car drivers if we all had an
occasional commercial-vehicle outing, to let us appreciate how certain
allowances should be made for a laden van. Certainly, on the outward
journey, I was always conscious of advice given to me on starting out:
''Mind you don't go off, or you'll get a piano in the back of your
neck.''

IF you need more room for living in your home, a professional firm
will help build an extension which creates more space. ''Often, the idea
of building an extension occurs to homeowners at the point where they
are planning to build a new garage, or replace an old one,'' said Tom
Fox, an Glasgow-trained architect who now runs a London-based lifestyle
research consultancy. ''The car is an extension of the home -- mobile
personal territory. And the increase in the number of privately owned
cars, and the dominant part they play in our lives, has transformed not
only our wider surroundings, but the home itself.
''Before the mid-1930s the garage was usually a crude shed or
outbuilding -- detached from the house, out of sight, and often little
better than the stable it replaced. In homes built after 1935, the
garage moved to the front of the plot, reflecting the changing status of
the car, as a more universal expression of taste and affluence. Later
homes were designed so that the garage was a part of the house itself,
affecting its interior layout.''
This change was most noticeable in suburban homes in the United
States, but houses built in Britain and western Europe during the 1950s
often devoted the whole of the ground floor to the garage and small
utility rooms -- a pattern which is still common today, and which has
made almost as much impact on the lifestyles of the occupants as the
new-found mobility that came with the car.
''The golden rule when building anything of a permanent nature is to
ensure that it fulfils the function for which it has been built,'' Tom
Fox said. ''You could extend into the garage, and construct a carport to
protect your car from the elements. If you consign the car to a
secondary position at the side or the back of the house, you could build
a pretty porch to provide a practical focal point at the main door of
your home.''
The best specialist building firms will provide advice and information
on the options you might like to consider when you are having a garage
built or extending your home. ''Many public libraries have books
containing copies of plans for extending bedrooms, bathrooms and
kitchens and for improving your home by adding a sun lounge,
conservatory or porch, and these are a useful source of ideas,'' Tom Fox
advised.
0 An extension can dramatically improve the value and appearance of
your home, and make life easier and more enjoyable for the whole family.
Whatever you plan to use the extra space for, you can have an extension
built exactly customised to suit your purpose. Most banks and building
societies will lend the cash required for extending and improving your
home, and expert specialist companies can construct extensions which
match and enhance the architecture and appearance of any house.
Choose a reputable firm with a track record of creating well-built and
imaginative extensions, and your new room will be practical and
versatile.
If you are planning to extend the kitchen or lounge to create a dining
area, the inclusion of patio doors or french windows will integrate your
home and garden. An extension can be made to appear part of the original
house by the use of colour. Have the extension and the room which it
joins in one colour scheme, using the dominant colours extensively in
both rooms, repeating variations of it on walls, carpets and textiles,
but selecting different and distinctive contrasts so that each room has
its own character.
Your home needs to feel comfortable, pleasant and convenient for the
life you lead, and creating a more spacious home with the help of a
specialist company may not be as costly as you imagine. Most reputable
firms will provide a free, no obligation, planning and quotation
service. Tom Fox considers that one of the most important aspects of
preparing a scheme for extending or improving your home is the survey.
''It is essential that a proper and accurate survey is carried out
showing positions of boundaries, services, walls structural and
non-structural,'' he said. ''Details of floor and roof construction and
of any adjoining properties with regard to zones or open space and
window should be included, as should levels of floors and related ground
levels.
These factors will determine to a large extent the different ways you
will be able to extend your property. Check that all works are properly
covered by insurance for all risks by your builder, and that you are
also properly covered. And make sure your plans are adequate in detail
and specifications, as these will form the main basis of the contract.''

ART Long, a college basketball player, is in trouble. While on a night
out in Cincinnati, Ohio, recently he ran foul of the law and now stands
accused of assaulting a police horse.
Reportedly, an officer on a horse stopped Long and his team-mate,
Danny Fortson, after they shouted abuse at him from their car. While the
policeman was questioning the two, Long allegedly began to punch the
horse. Long maintains that he was merely stroking the animal.
Regardless, he was arrested and charged with being disorderly while
intoxicated.
That charge might not be too serious if Long were not already serving
three years probation for possession of marijuana in Dodge City in 1993.
If he is convicted on his latest charge, not only will it most likely
bring his basketball career to a halt, it also will interrupt his
attendance at the University of Cincinnati where he is studying, what
else, criminal justice.
* THE city of Homestead, Florida, boasts a sizeable and impressive
sports complex that plays host to all manner of activities.
So proud are the administrators of their facility that they conduct
regular tours for interested parties. During a recent tour, a group was
shown just about everything there was to see, and outside every room a
sign briefly explained its function.
In the umpires' changing room, however, the sign appeared somewhat
different from the others. When asked the reason, the tour guide
explained: ''That's braille, so the umpires will know where to go.''
* YOU might say that Mike Brown is a man destined for misfortune. He
is a forward with the Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team. In recent
seasons, his form has been less than sparkling, a situation reflected in
the play of the team as a whole. This year they are the second worst in
the NBA.
Brown recently contemplated his fate. ''Dante's Inferno had nothing on
Mike Brown's Hell,'' he commented.
* BASEBALL players are renowned for being superstitious, and young
Dale Brewer Jr is no exception. It's just that his superstition is a
little more unusual.
Brewer is a pitcher with Sonoma State University in northern
California. In fact, he is the star of the team, something he attributes
to the McDonald's cheeseburger he stuffs into his back pocket before
taking the field.
The habit originated in 1992 when he was playing in a summer league
game in his home town of Millbrae, California. Having been obliged to
skip dinner in order to get to the match on time, he then sent his
mother off to McDonald's for a cheeseburger, which she threw to him on
the field. He wolfed half of it, stuffed the remainder into a pocket,
and promptly produced a spectacular game-winning performance. Since
then, the routine has continued and it seems to have worked.
Lindsey Meggs, baseball coach of Sonoma rival, Chico State, is
convinced that the story is true. ''It has to be,'' he says. ''Why would
anyone in their right mind make up something like that?''
* THE New York Times is a newspaper feted for the quality of its news
reporting and the dullness of its sports section. Former executive
editor A M Rosenthal once commented: ''We don't care about sport here,''
and despite an overhaul a couple of years ago, sport at the Times
remains a very poor relation.
It brought many a wry smile, therefore, when it was recently announced
that, in order to boost prices of its falling stock, the Times is
intending to build golf driving ranges at the site of several of its
printing plants. And it won't report on them either.
* DURING the now infamous baseball strike, a weight of opinion arose
that, in the fight between the team owners and the players, it was the
fans who were the ones losing out. It was they, after all, who waited
patiently while the multi-millionaires haggled venomously over
ever-increasing shares of a massive pie.
Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds and one of the most
vituperative of the bunch, was asked if she planned anything special for
the fans now that they were dutifully returning to watch her team.
''What do you mean?'' she replied.

HE will be the only player with a day job on the park at Hampden on
Saturday, but any man who survives a working week solely in the company
of six women ought to look upon the demands of a Scottish Cup final as
some kind of parole opportunity.
Graham Hay, it should be said, did not encourage the construction of
that sentence nor even hint at it, but some of us are daredevils by
nature. The manager of the Leeds Building Society in Anniesland,
Glasgow, had the day off yesterday to enjoy a rare experience, training
with his team-mates, but will revert to his normal evening work-outs
again as he heads towards the biggest game of his life.
''I am just delighted to get the chance of playing in the final at
this stage of my career,'' said Hay who, at 29, is realistic enough to
guess that he will not get many more opportunities. Hay represents the
more pragmatic branch of the professional football world, where the
possibility of fame and fortune has to be weighed against the likelihood
of long-term security in a job that he already enjoys.
''I train at nights with coach John Binnie but it is not ideal,'' said
the defender, ''simply because you don't have the banter and all the
usual football chat that goes on when you train with the lads. To be
honest, earlier in the season I wasn't really happy with the way things
were going. You don't mind the hard work, but it is difficult on your
own.''
Despite this considerable disadvantage, Hay has been able to win his
place in the side and acknowledges that the manager, Alex MacDonald, has
played it fair with him. ''If I play well on Saturday he picks me for
the next game. I take the game seriously but I can't see it as the
be-all and end-all. I enjoy my football but I have a good job.''
Hay never imagined he would be playing in a Scotish Cup final,
espeically as the years went by and he moved from one team to another,
determined to remain part-time. He started off with St Mirren, then
Stranraer, and then Falkirk, whose manager, Jim Jefferies, made it clear
that Graham could either turn full-time or go on his way. He chose to
carry on travelling and was transferred to Stirling Albion. From there
it was on to Clydebank and eventually he arrived at Airdrie.
Now he is close to his most exciting football occasion but when you
listen to Graham, one of the most laid-back footballers in the country,
you wonder if he will find it on a par with a sudden change in the
interest rate. ''I think the manager believes I am too laid-back at
times,'' he admitted, ''but he has always said that if I am playing well
enough I will be picked. It must be difficult when he doesn't see me
except at weekends.''
He was signed at the same time as Paul Harvey in a #150,000 deal
(''the bulk of it was for Paul'') but was surprised that full-time
Airdrie wanted him. ''I told the manager my situation wasn't going to
change, but he was willing to take the gamble and, thankfully, it has
worked out.''
He agrees it will probably be one of the biggest days in his life --
''every kid wants to play in a Scottish Cup final'' -- especially as he
didn't believe he would ever get there, but he takes a different
perspective as a result of being involved in another world in his day
job.
''I have too many other things to concentrate on, but I find it an
advantage if you have had a bad result to get away to think about other
things. It applies if you have had good one, too.''
He has no worry about alien supporters among the staff at the Building
Society but says that many of the calls since Airdrie reached the final
have been seeking tickets. ''A lot have said they wished me well but
hope we get gubbed.''
He had his doubts when he joined Airdrie but knows now that it was the
best move of his career.
Unlike Hay, Paul Jack has had to put aside his fondness from youth for
the team he and his mates face on Saturday. ''It is just one of these
things. I was a Celtic fan but there will be only one team that will
matter at Hampden and that will be Airdrie,'' said the midfield man who
was 30 earlier this month. Jack still admits that, if Airdrie hadn't
been in the final he would have been in the stands watching Celtic, just
as he was six years ago when they beat Rangers in the final.
His family will be wearing the Airdrie colours, too, just to make sure
there is no confusion and will be hoping that Jack will be one of a few
Airdrie men who will enjoy the victory they did not achieve in 1992
against Rangers. ''I feel we were overawed then by all the hype about
Ranger and their long wait to win that cup. It was only after we were
two down at half-time that we got a roasting from the manager and began
to play. I thought we got to Rangers a bit, too.''
''Even Coisty was not so chirpy and didn't answer the one-liners.''
Jack is convinced Airdrie have a genuinely good chance of winning the
cup while recognising that it will be a hard afternoon's work.
It is a viewpoint which you would hear again and again if you moved
among the Airdrie staff. They really do think this is their moment in
the sun.

because you don't have the banter and all the usual football chat that
goes on when you train with the lads'

SHARES of warship and submarine builder VSEL soared 88p to 1783p to
give a market capitalisation of around #680m after President of the
Board of Trade Michael Heseltine declared open season on the
Barrow-based company, allowing both British Aerospace and GEC to proceed
with their rival bids.
This certainly wrongfooted some, as strong rumours had built up that
GEC would be stopped because of its ownership of the competing Yarrow
shipyard on the Clyde. Indeed, in allowing GEC to go ahead, Mr Heseltine
has ignored the MMC's majority recommendation that GEC should be
blocked.
This is by no means the first time that a Minister has decided to
ignore the MMC's advice but it is still fairly unusual. In doing so, Mr
Heseltine said he had taken into account the views of the Departments
most closely concerned and in particular the Ministry of Defence's
appreciation of its own needs.
Two members of the MMC group did opt to allow GEC to go ahead, and the
Minister clearly found their arguments persuasive, as well as the views
of the MOD.
A double referral to the MMC is itself highly unusual. The last time
it happened was in 1989 and GEC was also then in the frame when it made
a joint bid with Siemens for Plessey. That was also eventually cleared.
The two dissenting members of the MMC, who set out their views in a
minority note, argued that in the face of sharply declining orders, the
industry would almost certainly be further rationalised and that the MOD
was well placed as an effective monopoly purchaser to extract value for
money from the industry.
They further found that the key contracts in the near term were all in
the process of being settled indpendently of the merger. And they judged
that once these contracts were placed, rationalisation would be needed
regardless of VSEL's ownership. On this basis, they concluded that the
merger was unlikely to hamper competition and that in the sub
contracting competitions it ran as a prime contractor, GEC had a strong
commercial incentive not to give its subsidiaries an unfair advantage.
This case was to Mr Heseltine's liking and he has acted accordingly.
What it means is that we are now back to a good old fashioned stock
market bid battle, something many analysts believe should not have been
tampered with in the first place. In last year's abortive tussle, BAe
raised its cash offer from #11.40 to #14 and lifted its main share part
of the offer to 3.3 from 2.747 BAe shares for every VSEL share, to match
GEC's #560m all cash offer for VSEL.
BAe of course is cash strapped -- though a rights issue to raise #383m
will have helped ease the strain -- compared to Lord Weinstock's GEC
with its enormous cash mountain of about #3000m. Both companies have
their eyes set on the next generation of five Trafalgar class nuclear
submarines and other forthcoming service ship requirements.
BAe has estimated that in the period up to 2010 approximately 1000
ships will be required with an estimated value of #112bn. It reckons
around 70% of this market will be represented by products such as
frigates, submarines and large surface ships which VSEL is capable of
building. But BAe would also like to get its hand on VSEL's cash which
would help strengthen its balance sheet. And in terms of earnings it
would also bring considerable benefits as it could offset VSEL's profits
against unused capital allowances, trading losses and ACT, driving down
the enlarged group's tax charge.
No doubt all the previous claims and counter claims will now be
repeated. Analysts expected BAe to be the first to return to the fray.
GEC, though, is quite capable of making a knockout counter offer if it
so wishes. The questions must be, though, how far it is prepared to go.
And does it in fact have longer term ambitions which encompass BAe
itself.
BAe meantine fell 10p to 537p while GEC dipped 3p to 314p.

<HEADLINE>Lloyd's offers Names #2800m settlement</HEADLINE>

LLOYD'S of London has unveiled a #2800m settlement plan to provide
''finality'' or drawing a line under losses incurred by Names or members
of the 300 year old institution in the accounting years up to the end of
1992.
The initial reaction from the Names associations was one of cautious
relief.
Some #800m is being put aside to settle Names' claims on condition
they drop litigation while the other #2000m is in the form of debt
credits which is a write-off of debts of those who simply cannot meet
their commitments.
The survival plan was accompanied by the disclosure that the 1992
accounting years had run up losses of #1193m compared with 1991's #2048m
setback. That has brought the accumulated deficit since 1988 to #7933m
and has ruined many who had pledged their wealth in order to participate
in the profits -- a total of #649m in 1986.
However Lloyds chairman David Rowland is projecting a 1993 profit of
#1051m because of better underwriting and rates and fewer disasters in
that year.
Lloyd's is planning to abandon its traditional three year accounting
and move onto annual reporting once the regulatory formalities are
agreed.
This will be a significant part of the plan to restore its viability
as it is expected that the years 1993, 1994 and 1995 will together show
total profits of over #2000m when they are announced next spring. Of
this, about #1000m will be used to fund a deficit of #5900m which is the
estimated total liabilities of Equitas. That is a vehicle set up to
absorb all Names' losses, chiefly ''long tail'' asbestosis claims in the
US.
There will be a ''firebreak'' between the past up to 1992 with the
promise not to levy the market for liabilities relating to this period
in later years Michael Deeny who is on the Litigating Names Committee
said that court action will continue until Lloyd's had made a legally
binding agreement on the #2800m package and a cap on future losses.
In February 1994, Lloyd's had offered #900m compensation and implied
it could not afford more -- but that was rejected by the Names.
Names are to be asked to put up #450m next year as a part of the
funding although that will count as a credit against future
contributions to the Central Fund. The agents are being approached for
#200m although some Names believe they should be touched for more given
the level of profits they have achieved in the past.
Mr Rowland said that capacity in the market was now an estimated
#8000m and that it will be necessary to generate additional resources
through making it easier for corporate capital to move into the market.

THE TRADING environment for retailers remains tough. Last week's
profit warning from W H Smith wiped 12% off their shares and dragged
much of the rest of the sector down. The City's antennae was put on
alert for bad news and so it was not surprising that news of a weaker
than expected fourth quarter's trading in Marks &amp; Spencer unsettled its
shares and overshadowed the good underlying performance of much of the
business last year.
Group pre-tax profits were 8.5% ahead of last year at a record #924.3m
on turnover up 4.1% to #6800m. The figures were distorted by a 53rd
trading week. Earnings per share improved by 7.2% to 22.4p and the
dividend was raised by 12% to 10.3p.
However, the City had been expecting profits of around #950m and so
the shares lost 10[1/2]p to 408[1/2]p. This follows the 20p decline last
Friday following W H Smith's profit warning. Following the M &amp; S results
announcement, City analysts cut their 1995/96 profit forecasts by as
much as #50m to around #1000m.
Attention focused on a deterioration in the trading position at
Brookes Brothers, the troublesome US menswear business. Too much
emphasis on formalwear meant that sales and profitability suffered.
However a new chief executive has been installed at Brookes and M &amp; S is
confident that it can recover from what Sir Richard described as a ''far
from satisfactory'' performance.
There was also concern, albeit lesser, about European trading. In
France M &amp; S took a deliberate decision to cut its prices to generate
more sales and it already appears to be working although margins have
slipped in the process. However there are always teething problems in
establishing a new business. Sir Richard is keen to point out that the
group is building a business for the long term not next month or next
year.
The UK business continued to perform strongly with further gains in
clothing market share to 17%, helped by the ''Outstanding Value''
campaign. Burtons, its nearest competitor has 12% market share.
Womenswear and babywear did particularly well.
By increasing the fashion content of its womens' clothes M &amp; S has
succeeded in attracting in new customers and reducing the reliance on
price. However demand for its menswear remains depressed along with the
rest of the market which may mena price cuts later in the year. The same
is true for the home furnishings business which grew by just 2% compared
with 14% last year.
M &amp; S has a high profile with its food business although it is not a
mainstream food retailer like the supermarket chains. Its emphasis on
high quality premium price fresh and chilled food products. Although
discounting is rife in the food retailing sector, M &amp; S managed to hold
its market share at 5%.
The financial services business continues to prosper. M &amp; S opened a
record number of new card accounts in the year and is very optimistic
about the prospects for its life and pensions products which went on
sale earlier this month. Sales on account cards represent over 20% of
group sales. Personal loans now represent a substantial and profitable
part of the business and the business was helped by continued
improvement in the already low bad debt ratio.
On any criterion, financial or market-based, Marks &amp; Spencer is a
leader. It has 25% of the mens' suit market in the UK, 40% of the
lingerie market and is the market leader in ready-prepared meals,
selling 78 million every year.
Although trading conditions are expected to remain tough not least of
inflationary pressures building up in food and clothing, the scale of
Marks &amp; Spencer's operation is such that it is one of the best, if not
the best, placed to withstand such pressures. Its close relationship
with its suppliers is a key advantage in the currrent challenging
climate.
However the company is confident about the future seeing scope for
expansion both in the UK and overseas in Continental Europe and the Far
East. Sites are actively being sought in Germany, Spain and the Far
East. Over #1000m of sales came from overseas operations, either from
franchisees or stand alone stores.
In the UK, refurbishment and extentions of existing town centre stores
is continuing to deliver an uplift in sales as are new product
developments. For example an expanded babywear range including bedlinen
and furniture is being introduced.
Once the City has digested the results and looked at the performance
relative to other retailers then it is likely to reassess Marks &amp;
Spencer and the shares could recover sharply. The speed of this process
will be helped by the generous dividend payment which takes the increase
in the past two years to 27.2%. The shares are an attractive investment
for the longer term.

THORN EMI made strong progress in repositioning itself last year with
the disposal of the loss-making Rumbelows electrical chain.
In the process it has increased its attraction to potential predators.
Walt Disney has made no secret of the fact that it wishes to buy Thorn
EMI's multi-million music business. EMI's record labels include Virgin,
Chrysalis and Capitol.
Thorn's chairman Sir Colin Southgate and Disney chief Michael Eisner
have had several exploratory meetings during the course of the year. Bid
rumours have fuelled a surge in Thorn's share price. Yesterday it added
10p to 1220p as the group reported a 23% rise in annual pre-tax profits
to #423.6m, before exceptional items. The total dividend increased to
36.5p after a final payment of 26.75p.
EMI Music profits jumped by 20% to #294.9m on sales up 24% to #2189m.
Thirty albums had sales of more than one million units including The
Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Bob Segar and Frank Sinatra. In
the UK, EMI Music performed strongly. The Beatles ''Live at the BBC''
reached number one in the UK chart and sold more than five million
copies worldwide. The new act Blur, won four Brit Awards and reached
number two in the UK chart with its ''Parklife'' album.
Investment continues to be made in developing and breaking new acts. A
30% increase in expenditure is budgeted for the current year. However
last year's expenditure in this area was offset by good growth in EMI's
catalogue and music publishing operations.
Thorn EMI continues to expand its music interests. In the year it
acquired Star Song Communications, which combined with EMI's existing
Sparrow Records business, created a major Christian music company in one
of the fastest growing segments of the US music market.
The HMV record store business also performed strongly posting a 130%
profits increase to #14m. Thorn plans to invest in the recently acquired
Dillons bookshop chain which is thought to have operational similarities
with the HMV business.
Thorn, the company's rentals division, saw profits rise by 18% to
#152.4m, and has been earmarked for expansion.
Following the Rumbelows disposal, Thorn EMI is now free to concentrate
financial resources and management effort on more exciting growth
markets. It has the financial strength to fund expansion with interest
cover increasing to 14.3 times during the year. Thorn refused to comment
yesterday on rumours that it is shortly to announce several multimedia
alliances that would create CD-ROMs and online services in partnership
with Apple Computer, Virgin Interactive Entertainment and publisher Von
Holtzbrinck.

SCOTTISHPOWER is one of four preferred bidders for an Australian
electricity distribution company thought to be worth between #400m and
#500m, it yesterday emerged.
It is believed the acquisition, if successful, would be the biggest
overseas move by a UK regional electricity company, excluding generators
National Power and PowerGen.
United Energy is the first electricity distribution company to be
privatised by the Australian state of Victoria.
Although the shortlist has now been drawn up, the winner of the
bidding contest is not expected to be known until the end of July.
With the state government keen to keep the wraps on the situation,
ScottishPower was yesterday remaining tight-lipped. It is thought the
administration in Victoria would require any successful overseas bidder
to bring in an Australian minority partner.
If the Glasgow-based company succeeds, the purchase will significantly
increase the size of its operations. United Energy is between
one-quarter and one-fifth of the size of an average UK regional
electricity company, with an annual turnover of several hundred million
pounds.
However, with gearing of only 7.8% at March 31, ScottishPower would
have no trouble digesting its bid target.
It is believed that Lend Lease Corp, which is quoted on the Australian
Stock Exchange, is making a joint bid with Utilicorp United and Northern
States Power, which are both listed in New York. The consortium is also
thought to include two unlisted financial institutions, Australian
Mutual Provident Society and New South Wales State Super Board.
Like ScottishPower, New York-listed Pacific Gas and Electric Co and
state-owned Electricite de France are believed to be bidding
individually.
The shortlist reportedly does not include a consortium of UK company
Southern Electric and Australian Gas Light Co.
Disclosing nothing on the Australian situation, a ScottishPower
spokesman said: ''These processes are bound by confidentiality and,
while we are interested in a number of opportunities, we cannot give any
specifics about any single one.''
ScottishPower is well-placed to make acquisitions, with the board's
international experience having been bolstered by the recent arrival of
chief executive Ian Robinson from Trafalgar House.
As well as enjoying low gearing, ScottishPower has expertise in more
areas than the distributors and generators south of the Border.
Finance director Ian Russell, another relatively recent arrival from
conglomerate Tomkins, has admitted that ScottishPower ran its rule over
Northern Electric following the announcement of the Trafalgar bid.
Shares in ScottishPower yesterday edged up 2p to 333p.

WHEN a child witness was asked not long ago whether anything had
happened during her court appearances that had surprised her, she
replied that she had not expected to be asked everything twice. It is so
obvious to lawyers that where there is examination there must be
cross-examination, that no-one had thought to explain this beforehand to
the child.
To the casual spectator in search of thrills, cross-examination is
likely to be the most interesting part of any case. If the presentation
of evidence in chief can be likened to a canny stockman leading a
compliant bull round a county showground, then cross-examination is like
that matador confronting, outwitting, and dispatching a toro bravo -- or
so it should be. Unfortunately, many would-be toreros, when not
themselves tossed and gored, opt for death by tedium or, even worse, end
up looking like men in the parade who follow the elephants.
Technically, cross-examination, by which we mean the questioning of
the other side's witnesses, involves three main things. First, any
damaging evidence should, so far as possible, be negated by way of
qualification or retraction. Secondly, any information useful to one's
own cause should be elicited. Thirdly, the witness should be given an
opportunity to comment in advance on such evidence as is likely to be
led in contradiction later in the case.
The manner in which these matters are dealt with is very much a matter
of choice, depending on the style of the advocate in question. There are
those who adopt the friendly, ''some mistake here which I am sure we can
clear up'' approach. Others are truculent and abrasive. Others again
operate with a facial expression not unlike a sneer. Some of the best
mix the three.
There is also the much-vexed question of brevity. Consider, if you
will, the situation in which a witness says he saw the accused approach
and punch and kick the victim in the street.
To challenge this, one lawyer will put a whole repertory of questions,
including such things as the condition of the lighting; the clothing of
the accused; the presence of other people; the weather conditions at the
time; how much the witness had to drink (lawyers assume that all
witnesses have been drinking); how long it all took and, a favourite
question of the dim-but-dogged, whether something else might have
happened that the witness did not see. (''Could there have been a police
horse there you didn't notice?'').
Another, in similar circumstances, will simply say something along the
lines of: ''I could stand here all day suggesting that you might be
mistaken and you would not agree with me, yes?'' There is nothing to
suggest that the latter approach is not at least as effective as the
former.
It is sometimes said that the golden rule of cross-examination is that
you should not ask any question to which you don't already know the
answer. The lead in the dark may pay off, but it is more likely to
produce an adverse result, and in this field of endeavour an own-goal
counts double. Of the many examples faithfully recorded over the years
by gleeful bystanders, I will confine myself to the following:
''Miss Brown, why was your fiance so interested in drawing your
attention to my client as he walked past your window?''
''Well, he said 'There's Eck McBain that's well known for breaking
intae folk's hooses'.''
This is a straightforward answer, but the careless questioner may lay
himself open to a dig from a more experienced witness, as in the case of
the person who, quite unnecessarily, asked a police officer to repeat
that his client had made no reply. ''That's right, sir,'' came the
answer, ''just hung his head in shame.''
But why dwell on the inefficient and the ineffectual? A skilful
cross-examination is a thing of beauty, at its best a series of
apparently innocuous questions each getting the answer sought, and thus
eventually coming to the question which elicits the answer that the
witness does not wish to, but logically must, give.
The witness may be reluctant because he is lying, or simply because he
is being driven to acknowledge that his previous evidence must have been
wrong. Either way, such results are best achieved by stealth. This,
consequently, is one of the best arguments for judges remaining quiet,
since an injudicious intervention from the Bench may have the effect of
alerting the intended victim and sending him scurrying off into a
thicket of obfuscation from which it may be difficult to flush him.
I am sorry to say that I was not present at the time of the following
story, but I had it from one who was, and pass it on as a fine, if
little-known, example of the art of the cross-examiner.
The advocate involved (now a retired judge), was questioning the
pursuer in a case involving an alleged breach of contract. The witness
had put himself forward as a scrupulously respectable businessman whose
word was as good as his bond. The defence, however, had discovered
something that the man's own lawyers did not know -- namely that he had
been a declared bankrupt in England some years previously.
Towards the beginning of the cross-examination, counsel asked, almost
as an aside: ''Were you in Torquay on 27th July, 1952?'', giving the
date and place of the unhappy event. ''Yes'' was the answer. Thereafter
the matter was not returned to, but the witness, fearing that it would
but not knowing when, went on, for reasons that his advisers never
understood, to lose his composure and make a mess of the rest of his
evidence. When you don't quite know how the damage has been done, then
you may safely say that you have witnessed a good cross-examination.

WHEN all the world was young and I was a junior counsel, thieves and
robbers had some pride. Not for them the ski mask, the bludgeon, and the
gun. Instead they preferred the delicacy of the condom, the jelly, and
the lollipop stick.
Compared with what could be done with these items, present-day crime
is just plain crude. It takes no skill. Anyone can do it: even readers
of this fine newspaper. Armed with real or simulated guns, masked with
balaclavas or the like, the criminals crash into their target making the
maximum noise to terrorise their victims; usually young women tellers.
Not so long ago you got a kicking in the jail if word went round that
you had assaulted wee lasses. Nowadays there seems to be no such
scruple. Ah! the gentle simplicity of the condom, the jelly, and the
lollipop stick; the tools of the trade of safe-blowing.
The safeblower was an aristocrat among criminals, and his victims were
institutions, not young women. I have seen security videos of robberies,
and they are terrifying in the extreme. The actuality must be terror
beyond belief. It is crude crime, dependent only on horror for its
success. The crime of safe-blowing, on the other hand, relied on skill.
If properly carried out it frightened no-one except the Bench, who
believed the whole fabric of society was about to be blown away and
handed down heavy sentences. When a new generation of safes came out
without keyholes, the safe-blower's skills became redundant.
The condom, the jelly, and the lollipop stick may well be preferable
to the gun, but in these matters society has no choice. The knowledge of
their use is still there, embedded in criminal folklore, but modern
technology makes it useless. Yet it was a crime of considerable
technical skill. Here's how the deed was done.
First you selected your ''peter'', as a safe was known, and as a
prison cell is still known. If you were wise you chose an old one on a
Friday night in a country town: old because they were more easily
opened, and in a country town because on a Friday they would contain the
takings from many of the businesses in the area.
A Friday also gave you the whole weekend to do the job, and scarper
before your workmanship was discovered. Forget all you have read about
cracksmen with stethoscopes listening to the tumblers of the combination
locks. I never met any such crook, and I doubt if they ever existed.
The safe-blower carried a piece of gelignite about the size of a nut,
known to the trade as ''jelly''. He also carried a detonator, a small
torch battery, a condom, and a lollipop stick. The trick was to get the
jelly into the lock mechanism itself, and if you idly poked it into the
keyhole it fell down to the bottom of the safe, because ten chances to
one the safe had a false front.
That was where the condom came in. The jelly was put into the top of
the condom, and the lollipop stick was used as a ramrod, and very
skilfully and gently you eased the jelly and the detonator through the
keyhole, across the intervening space, and tamped it firmly, but not too
firmly in case you blew your hands off, into the lock mechanism. How
much jelly was used I refuse to tell you. That was where the skill came
in. Too much and you blew out the side wall of the bank; too little and
you jammed the lock.
But that was not the end of the job. You now had to deaden the safe.
You did that by getting as much cloth material as you could find: the
carpets for a start. Besides carpets it was amazing what you could find
in the cupboards of a bank. From the manager's spare suit to the
cushions on the chairs, everything was piled against the safe, both to
deaden the sound and to drive the force of the explosion inwards, where
it was needed.
Then, quite simply, you led the wires from the detonator into another
room and applied them to the battery. If you had done your job properly
there would be one soft drum-beat of sound and the door would swing
open.
I think it was the excitement of not knowing what you were going to
find when you opened the safe door that drove quite intelligent people
back again and again to this type of crime. It was one easily solved by
the police.
Every skilled tradesman leaves his trademark, and safe-blowers were no
exception. One fellow I defended always applied the jelly to the hinges
of the safe, and was unique in doing so. The crime shouted the name of
the criminal, and despite the most elaborate alibi, he was soon lifted.
Ramensky, or Johnnie Ramsay, as he later called himself, was probably
the king of them all, although I know another, still alive, who would
dispute that title. Ramensky was used in Italy during the war to open a
safe containing important documents. Before doing so he coolly bargained
with a British general for his liberty from the sentence he was serving.
Others retired early and became consultants. They gave advice on the
amount of jelly to be used, and on other matters that need not concern
us here. In return they were paid a percentage of the proceeds.
Compared with the violence of present-day crime it was a gentlemanly
affair, but time lends an enchantment to this type of crime which was
probably lacking when it was committed. Ramsay died in prison, and of
the others, the three best known of their generation died violently in
petty gang warfare in the streets.
Yet I remember the misplaced skill and intelligence of the safe-blower
with a sort of nostalgia for a lost age of crime. I will never have any
such feeling for the merchant with the mask and the gun, whose only
trade is terror.

THE MacFarlane Group of packaging companies expects another bumper
year in 1995, despite suffering a squeeze in margins from the rising
price of raw materials.
''We have started 1995 strongly and sales and profits are so far well
ahead of the same period last year,'' company chairman Lord MacFarlane
of Bearsden told the annual general meeting in Glasgow yesterday.
The MacFarlane Group reported a healthy 28.1% growth in pre-tax
profits to #16.3m last year on a 20.9% increase in turnover to #117m and
Lord MacFarlane said he would be ''disappointed'' if the group failed to
make taxable profit of #20m this year.
Lord MacFarlane also made clear that the group, which spent #11m on
buying three new companies last year, is still very much on the
acquisition trail.
He said the company had cash balances of #12m which it planned to
spend on capital expenditure this year and ''some very interesting
acquisition opportunities in the pipeline.''
Lord MacFarlane told the Herald that the MacFarlane Group could spend
between #25m and #30m on buying a further two or three companies in the
UK or Ireland this year.
Chief executive Bill Mackie said these would probably be in the food
packaging and pharmaceuticals sectors, where the group is
under-represented at the moment.
''There are a lot of good private companies which are still in family
hands which at some stage will have to do something and we are certainly
in close touch with many of them,'' Lord MacFarlane said.
The Glasgow-based group employs a full-time development director,
whose job is to search out and assess acqusition possibilities.
Lord MacFarlane recognised that margins had been squeezed by an
overall increase of 30% to 40% in the cost of raw materials last year,
but said that any tightening of margins should be compensated for by
increased sales.

JUST off the M40, in the heart of the Warwickshire countryside, the
Heritage Motor Centre near Gaydon is one of the most notable vehicle
museums in Europe. Set alongside Rover's test centre -- well out of
sight behind tall bankings -- its collection features not just Rover,
but also Austin, Morris, Wolseley, Riley, Thornycroft, Albion, Trojan,
MG, Standard, Triumph, Alvis, Leyland, Land Rover and more.
The purpose-built and very modern museum, opened in 1993, is on two
floors. It has more than 150 cars on display, plus other exhibition
areas, and film shows, often of sporting events, throughout the day.
Outside, there is a Land Rover off-road course which can be sampled for
an extra charge. Some of the site is even maintained as a small-scale
nature reserve.
The cars are impeccably presented, including Austin Sevens and Morris
Minors, a comprehensive 1930s section, and rarities like the only
surviving example of the majestic Leyland Eight sports car. From earlier
decades there is a 1911 Austin Town Carriage, with its central driving
position and engine under the driver's seat, and a Wolseley Tri-Car
built in 1897.
One fascinating thing about this museum is that so many of the cars
are the property of the successor company to whichever earlier
enterprise actually built them. The ''Old Number One'' MG of 1925 is
there, alongside styling and safety prototypes, racing saloons, Metro
6R4 and TR7 V8 rally cars, the Mini Coopers which won the Monte Carlo
Rally, the Rover-BRM gas turbine Le Mans racer, and Austin's only Grand
Prix car, of 1908.
Among the most dramatic exhibits are the three world-famous MG record
cars. Last of them was EX. 181. Phil Hill streaked this wonderfully
aerodynamic machine, in its final 1506cc specification with a power
output approaching 300bhp, over the Bonneville Salt Flats at 254mph.
Only close up do you realise how tiny overall its dimensions are.
Several Scottish competition drivers are mentioned in the films, and
there are three Albions, including a formidable Scotstoun-built A6
Tourer of 1909. A special caterpillar-tracked Land Rover was produced by
Cuthbertsons of Biggar.
One of the most endearing cars is a rather stylish little Wolseley
Voiturette of 1899. It was designed by Herbert Austin before he branched
out on his own. Austin tackled the original 1000 Miles Trial with it,
and showed himself as good a driver as he was a designer by winning a
class award.
Strolling round this splendid collection gives a fine impression of
the logical steps by which car design has progressed. There is no sense
of ridiculing the pioneers, rather a feeling of affection for men like
Austin, who, 95 years ago this month, was chugging his single-cylinder
machine through the 1000 Miles Trial, by Carlisle and Moffat, up the
exhausting timed climb of Birkhill on the Selkirk road, helping to
demonstrate to a world still largely thirled to the horse, where the
personal transport future lay.

Flats in Utah, top, the car in action, above right, and the first

IT seemed odd that the launch drive for the new Skoda Felicia should
take place in Shropshire, the fictional realm of PG Wodehouse's Earl of
Emsworth at Blandings Castle. Odd, because the Skoda is usually seen as
anything but an aristocratic car: more like transport for the plebs.
There are people who continue making cracks about Skodas, assuming
that they are still rough and ready affairs. That attitude has never
been widespread in Scotland, because here we realise that this Czech
make has a very loyal following. While Mercedes customers are top of the
league in terms of how many of them trade in their old car for another
one of the same make, Skoda's are number two.
The front-wheel drive Favorit shrugged off most of the jokes aimed at
the company's archaic rear-engined designs. Now, re-financed as part of
the Volkswagen group, Skoda has introduced the Felicia as essentially a
re-skinned Favorit. Although the body is much more stylish and
aerodynamically efficient, it is still roomier than the class average.
There are welcome improvements to the passenger cabin design.
Unexpectedly, the higher-priced Favorits easily outsold the base
model. Skoda's UK marketing people, however, insisted on having one real
budget price Felicia, which is why the previously discarded 54bhp engine
specification has been brought back. That allows the entry-level Felicia
LXi to come in with a showroom tag of #5999. It is worth noting that
Skoda prices include the delivery charge.
That 54bhp car is by no means quick, with a 0-60mph time of 17 seconds
and a test track maximum just on 90mph. Fuel consumption figures are
48mpg at 56mph, 36 at 75 and 34mpg in town. Using the same 1289cc
capacity of Skoda's own all-alloy engine, the tuned 68bhp version,
available in three equipment levels up to the GLXi at #7699, has better
economy figures overall. It will hit 60mph in about 14 seconds, and the
top speed is marginally higher.
The Skoda engine shows its age in the throaty way it runs at motorway
speeds. But the Felicia -- which revives a model name previously used
for a 1950s convertible -- feels stable on the road, is more sporting to
handle than people unfamiliar with the company's excellent rally record
might suppose, and has the highest standard of finish Skoda has achieved
so far.
In 1994, for the first time, this was the company's best export market
worldwide. The Felicia should help to hold that position, especially as,
later this year, it will be available with 1.6-litre petrol and
1.9-litre diesel Volkswagen engine options. If you want a Skoda estate,
though, you will have to be content for the moment with a Favorit.
Not all companies, even those which score well in it, put great
emphasis on the JD Power customer satisfaction survey. However, Skoda
has moved up from 21st place in 1993 to 13th last year and seventh in
the most recently published table. Many manufacturers would love being
involved in a joke like that.

* THE Royal Scottish Automobile Club has attracted the strongest entry
since the 1970s to the Perth Scottish Rally on June 2 to 4. More than
160 crews appear on the complex entry list. First away are the drivers
in the main international event, a round of both the European
championship and the Mobil 1/Top Gear British rally championship.
Top seed here is Alister McRae, driving the Nissan Sunny GTi with
which he leads the Mobil points table. He faces stiff opposition from
last year's winner Malcolm Wilson in a Ford Escort RS Cosworth, as well
as from Nissan team-mates Gregoire de Mevius from Belgium and Ari
Mokkonen from Finland. Alain Oreille from France and Robbie Head drive
the Renault Clio Williams entries, David Llewellin and another Finn,
Jarmo Kytolehto, Vauxhall Astras, and Dom Buckley a Volkswagen Golf GTi.
Other high-seeded Scandinavians include Tomas Abramsson from Sweden in
an Escort Cosworth, and the Finns Tapio Laukkanen in a Golf GTi and Olli
Harkki in a Mitsubishi Lancer. Farthest-from-home entry is Ching Jung
Kao in a Peugeot 205 from Taiwan.
Contenders for the Burmah Scottish championship include the leaders
David Gillanders and Brian Lyall in Escort Cosworths. There is a special
Land Rover class, a 30-plus entry of Colway Junior championship crews,
and a small historic event led off by Mike Hibbert's Lotus Cortina. Most
nostalgic entry, though, is a Subaru Impreza midway down the
international list driven by the inimitable Roger Clark.
* THIS is a significant year for Suzuki. Its new Baleno is one of the
best-looking saloons ever to come from Japan. The Swift, an underrated
contender in the 1300 class, now also comes as a one-litre. And the
Vitara 4x4 is to have the benefit of a new V6 engine. Scottish motoring
writers were asked to keep April 27 clear for a test day involving all
three models. That was the last that has been heard of the event.
* PUBLISHED by Osprey at #25.00, the book Skoda, Laurin &amp; Klement
takes the Czech company's history, well before the introduction of the
Felicia, back to its 19th-century origins. Bicycles, motorcycles,
trucks, tanks, armoured cars, railway locomotives, elegant
Hispano-Suizas built under licence, and innumerable sporting successes,
all play their part in the story of what is shaping up to be, once
again, a powerhouse of Central European industry.

ANYONE who watched the Formula Ford race at Knockhill on April 30 will
tell you they saw something new and exciting that day. Among the names
in the most hotly contested class in Scottish motor racing was that of
19-year-old Andrew Kirkaldy, unknown to the crowd before the event
started, but the number one topic of conversation afterwards.
He qualified an impressive fourth, and within a few laps was running
second, having applied outstanding racecraft to make up the places. By
setting the fastest lap of the race he quickly caught the leader, who
held on to his position mainly through some robust defensive moves. Even
then, the winning margin was just three hundredths of a second. It was
undoubtedly the finest start to a racing career any of us had seen in
years.
Kirkaldy is reassuringly ordinary in real life -- pleasant, fun to be
with, a Nigel Mansell poster on his bedroom wall. He's from St Andrews
but is studying Mechanical Engineering at Strathclyde University. He'd
rather be a professional racing driver, but he'd also like the degree to
fall back on.
His motorsport background is in karting, which he did for seven years.
He's been Scottish Champion in his class twice, and might have made
British Champion in 1994 if it hadn't been for brake failure in the
final round.
Just as important as this experience is the fact that he has good
people behind him. His Van Diemen (one of the top makes of car in
Formula Ford) was bought by Sandy Watson, owner of Watsons Auto Salvage
and a former racer himself. Andrew's father, John, provides the finance
to run it, while the actual preparation is done by class expert Louis di
Resta.
Di Resta's contribution is vital. If Kirkaldy had gone straight out
and done a race with no practice he would have finished dead last. In
his first run at Knockhill he was, understandably, six seconds a lap off
the pace, frankly scared and confused by the car. Over the next
fortnight, though, di Resta put him through another three test sessions
and brought him up to speed, with amazing results.
All this back-up would amount to nothing, though, without Kirkaldy's
own special qualities. More impressive even than his speed is the fact
that he is quite happy to acknowledge what he's doing wrong. This is
almost unheard of among racing drivers, and was exactly the quality that
made David Coulthard stand out when he was in Kirkaldy's present
position five years ago.
Before the year is out you will hear someone proclaiming Kirkaldy as
the next Coulthard, but it's much too early to take that kind of talk
seriously. He certainly has the ability and, crucially, the attitude to
progress successfully through the sport.

In the first Motoring Extra Ross Finlay reports on the new Rover 400,
the launch of the updated Felicia from Skoda and has a look at the
latest motoring news and developments
MOST people's first reaction to the new Rover 400, has been that it is
not only a fine-looking range, but also one in which even the
entry-level 414 has a well-designed and fitted-out interior. Using, with
one notable exception, Rover's highly regarded K-series engine, it comes
as a 414 with different equipment levels at #11,795 and #12,195, as a
manual transmission 416 from #12,995 to #14,995, and with automatic
transmission at #15,945.
While the previous 400 series was a development of the 200, one being
a four-door and the other a five, the new 400 is to be a full range on
its own. This year's planned production consists entirely of five-door
hatchbacks, at the moment with 1.4 litre and 1.6 litre engines. Later
there will be diesel and two-litre petrol engine options. Four-door
saloons arrive in 1996.
This has been widely billed as the last co-operative design involving
Rover and its previous partner Honda. All the manual transmission
versions make use of the K-series engine, as a familiar 1.4-litre and
also in the 1.6-litre size it was once said could never be built.
Rover's engineers have done some subtle work to make that happen.
The exception to the K-series rule is the 416 SLi automatic. Rover
does not have a suitable self-change transmission to use with its own
engine, and the automatic comes with 1.6-litre Honda power. It is
interesting to compare the characteristics of the twin-cam Rover and the
single-cam Honda engines, which are almost exactly the same capacity,
although the Honda is a much longer-stroke design.
With 113bhp available, the Honda is marginally more powerful. The
Rover gains a modest advantage in torque, and while it peaks at 3000rpm,
the Honda torque curve does not hit its highest point until 5100.
From the outside, the Rover's ''family style'' front end makes it
clear that the 400 is meant to be seen as a smaller brother of the 600.
As before, there is no doubt that, in its appreciation of details like
the corporate grille and the rear number plate chrome surround, Rover
realises what is needed to keep its cars in the premium price bracket.
That is also obvious when you examine the interior, which includes
modern Rover trademarks like the stainless steel sill plates, wood
veneers, and the choice of fabrics.
The trim material will certainly be familiar to Scottish buyers. Up to
the 416i this is in Paisley pattern cloth. From the 416 Si onwards the
velour trim is called Kashmir. The stylists have been doing their
homework. As the wonderful display of shawls in Paisley Museum
demonstrates, the famous Paisley pattern was inspired by traditional
Kashmiri designs.
Those fabrics, the restrained use of the wood veneers, the sensible
layout of controls, and such minor items as a driver's clutch foot rest,
all combine to give the 400 an impressive interior. However, it has to
be remembered that this is the little brother of the 600. Two tall
passengers in the rear seat would hardly enjoy a long run.
On the open road, the 1.4 and 1.6-litre versions feel quite different.
Both cars, with 103bhp and 111bhp respectively, have identical gear
ratios. Only the tyre sizes give the 416 higher overall gearing. In
fact, the ratios are stacked more for acceleration than for motorway
cruising, since neither model will better 20mph per 1000rpm of engine
speed.
The 414 reaches 60mph in about 11 seconds and has a test track maximum
around 115mph. The manual transmission 416 takes a second off the time
and adds perhaps three miles per hour to the speed. But it trims more
off the significant 30-50 and 50-70mph times in fourth gear, since it
has much more urge for overtaking.
Despite the fairly low gearing, both manual versions are fairly frugal
and remarkably similar on fuel. Only a few decimal points separate the
414 and 416 in their 55mpg returns at 56mph and 43 at 75. The smaller
car has a slight advantage around town: 31mpg compared with 29.
While the 414 shows that the smaller-size K-series engine is right up
with the best in its class in performance terms, the 416 certainly feels
livelier, particularly in the middle ranges. It is also noticeably
noisier when let rip.
Although Rover has recently gone from a Japanese partnership to being
wholly owned by the Germans, it is quite clear that its own engineers
have their development programmes well in hand. Using light pistons in
the 1.6-litre engine means that it actually weighs less than the 1.4.
Enthusiasts with long memories will recall that it was designing
lightweight pistons, first for cars and then for First World War
aeroplanes, which put W O Bentley on the road to fame if not to fortune.
The magazine critics who, as usual, feel that the 400 could be a more
sporting saloon miss the point. With this car Rover is not interested so
much in high speed cornering characteristics as in secure handling and
really good ride quality. It has certainly achieved that, as well as a
high standard of finish, interior equipment and trim, a comprehensive
alarm and immobiliser system, and an overall feeling of refinement which
is the 400's main appeal.
* The aerodynamic styling of the Rover 414, the entry-level model at
#11,795 is pictured above, is complemented by the subtle blend of
Paisley pattern and wood interior, available in the 414i, 416i, 414Si
and 416Si models

SCOTTISH meat exports to Europe are booming, with sales targets being
revised upwards in the light of past success.
Scotmex, the central organisation with responsibility for developing
beef, lamb, and pigmeat exports to Europe, has already exceeded its
original target by #30m and has set a new target of #220m for the
current year.
Speaking at a news conference in Perth yesterday, Mr Martin
Grantley-Smith, Scotmex chief executive, said the figures were
particularly pleasing when viewed against a background of continuing
economic recession in Europe generally and the German restrictions on
imports because of BSE.
''We have been operating in a fairly adverse climate, so we are very
pleased to see such success,'' he said.
Much of that success in Europe has centred on the beef side of the
business, with exports in 1994 valued at #108m, as against #94m for
lamb. Scotmex chairman, Mr Alan Stevenson, outlined the company's plan
to get lamb out of the ''commodity straitjacket'' and establish it at
the quality end of the market, where it could attract a premium price.
''We aim to establish a specific identity for a proportion of Scotch
lamb, to differentiate it from the general mass of product which is
marketed in Europe,'' he said. France and Holland would be particular
targets.
The successful Scotch Beef Club formula -- where leading restaurants
are asked to serve Scotch beef and to identify it as such on the menu --
will be adapted to accommodate Scotch lamb. This system has been run on
a trial basis for lamb in Holland, and is now ready to be extended to
other outlets throughout Europe.
The hope is that, after experiencing Scotch quality at the restaurant
table, the public will recognise the product on the supermarket shelf
and be prepared to buy it at a premium price.
For pigmeat, the Scotmex marketing team has undertaken a survey to
identify niche market opportunities for Scottish producers, and expects
to see developments in that sector later this year.
One area of concern is Italy -- the largest market for Scotch beef --
where there was a slight decline last year. This was attributed, in
part, to meat exporting companies competing with one another in one
particular part of the country and being forced, as a consequence, to
drop prices. Mr Stevenson emphasised the importance of targeting sales,
so as to avoid that kind of wasteful competitiveness.
For the future, Scotmex staff propose to accelerate beef exports
through major campaigns at retail level. New markets will be explored in
Scandinavia, Austria, Greece, Portugal, and Finland.
Mr Grantley-Smith said that Sweden, in particular, offered many
opportunities. Customers were prepared to pay high premiums for quality.
Currently they ate no lamb at all, giving potential for building up a
market.
* Scotch Premier Meat has outlined plans for increasing throughput at
its Edinburgh plant. The company aim is to see one third of its output
from Edinburgh going to the export market, and have appointed sales
managers in France and Italy.

Calls for Government support for the budding cashmere industry in
Scotland have been backed by Western Isles MP Mr Calum Macdonald.
In a letter to Sir Hector Monro, the Scottish Office Minister for
Agriculture and the Environment, Mr Macdonald has called for support
payments currently available to sheep produceers to be made available to
goat producers as well.
The proposal, put forward by the Scottish Cashmere Producers'
Association (SCPA) is that farmers be permitted to substitute cashmere
goats for some or all of their sheep within the existing subsidy quotas.
Mr Macdonald said yesterday: ''I cannot see any reason why the
Government should turn down such a sensible and valuable change.''

<HEADLINE>#4.2m bid offers windfall for 'lost' wool investors</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978239646</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Wool Marketing Board officials are trying to track down more
than 50 investors -- or their descendants -- who could be due a windfall
of up to #30,000 for shares which they considered worthless.
The resurgence of interest in the shares arises from a decision of the
wool board, through its subsidiary Wool Growers (Great Britain Ltd), to
make a #4.2m offer for Scottish, English and Welsh Wool Growers Ltd
(SEWWG), on the basis of #4.10p for each #1 of capital held.
Many of the 1400 members of SEWWG live in Scotland, but because of a
fire at the company's offices in Glasgow, 10 years ago, the list of
shareholders is incomplete.
Some of the missing shareholders could be elderly Scottish sheep
farmers who joined the wool growers' co-operative society -- then known
only as Scottish Wool Growers Ltd -- when it was formed in 1926. The
last dividend, of one farthing for each pound of wool handled, was paid
in 1964.
The company still has details of the membership numbers allocated to
the missing investors, but all details of the holders were destroyed in
the fire.
Staff from both the wool board and SEWWG will travel to Westruther in
Berwickshire on Friday, for the Scotsheep '95 event, in the hope that
some of the missing shareholders may be tracked down there.
They will establish a share shop and will be able to handle enquiries
from people who want more information on the takeover bid.
As agents for the wool board SEWWG Ltd handles producers' wool at
depots at Evanton and Hillington in Scotland, and in Cumbria, south of
the border. It also runs a farm supplies business. Turnover to March 31
last year was #3.5m, with profits of #10,000 carried forward. The
takeover bid will require a 90% acceptance by June 14.
The numbers of the untraced members are:
251, 377, 421, 434, 479, 486, 487, 511, 513, 514, 516, 518, 553, 561,
584, 602, 607, 608, 634, 658, 685, 723, 733, 734, 757, 761, 774, 776,
791, 803, 827, 828, 833, 864, 876, 889, 905, 907, 908, 917, 918, 975,
3365, 4053, 4111, 4186, 9142, 9520, 9567, 9830, 9870, 9917, 91097.
Any member with one of the above numbers should contact Mr Douglas
Robertson, SEWWG Ltd, Wool House, A4 Stephenson Street, Hillington
Industrial Estate, Glasgow.

<HEADLINE>Warning to spray rape, not change</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978239648</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
OILSEED rape growers in Scotland could find more benefit in
re-considering their crop management policies, rather than changing the
variety they grow, according to Dr Kerr Walker, of the Scottish
Agricultural College.
Varieties which start out being resistant to light leaf spot disease
may later become susceptible. Expert opinion is that the disease adapts
to attack them. Farmers, by switching to other varieties, can actually
trigger a transfer of the disease to the new variety.
Dr Walker believes that the disease mutates to attack new varieties,
and he has come to the conclusion that the way forward may not be to
keep switching varieties, but to adopt a simple fungicide spray
programme.
The Bristol variety's three essential assets -- earliness, yield, and
quality -- mean that it is attractive to growers in many areas, as long
as it is well managed with a fungicide programme.
Dr Walker is of the view that light leaf spot, which has affected
Scottish oilseed rape crops for many years, is a disease of the species
rather than of varieties.
He suggests that the disease may comprise several different strains
which assume dominance in turn, according to which one is best suited to
assault the variety under attack.
''Even resistant varieties can, quite suddenly, become badly
affected,'' he said. ''However, treatment with a fungicide is reliable
and effective.''

SOME 17,000 hectares of flax will be grown in Britain this season
compared to approximately 2000 hectares in 1993, says Mr Nigel Bazeley,
a director of Robin Appel, whose two associated companies, British Fibre
and Natural Fibres Organisation, are developing the crop's processing
and marketing.
He argues that the need to increase the production of non-food crops,
in order to reduce food surpluses, should favour the expansion of flax,
supported by firmer prices and the development of a relatively low-cost
production and processing system.

OUTSIDE the Sheraton hotel here on Monday evening, Gerry Adams was
sitting in the sun, resting from his labours. Inside, Northern Ireland
Minister, Baroness Denton, was trying to get the assembled press to show
an interest in economic development.
It was an uphill task -- largely because of the unseen presence of the
man in the sun. She was incessantly peppered with political questions,
bravely replying that this week's conference on economic development was
an altogether splendid event and should not be overshadowed by politics.
It will be, of course. Marx was not the only one to observe that
economics follows politics.
This is the President's White House Conference on trade and investment
in Ireland, meaning Northern Ireland and six border counties in the
Republic. The President promised to convene it when Sinn Fein agreed to
the cease-fire and Mr Adams was allowed into the United States. It's a
misnomer, of course: the conference will take place in the hotel, not
the White House. It opens this evening and Mr Clinton is speaking
tomorrow. Other speakers will be the Vice-President, the Secretary of
State and various other American luminaries -- and Gerry Adams.
Indeed the main news event, for the assembled reporters, is
undoubtedly this evening's meeting between Mr Adams and Sir Patrick
Mayhew. The British side say that it will be a formal meeting of no
significance. Mr Adams says it will be substantive and he is quite ready
to discuss decommissioning.
Don't get all excited. For the British, this is a term of art meaning
the IRA must agree to dispose of its arsenal of weapons and explosives,
perhaps handing them over to some American intermediary. For the IRA, it
means discussing the ''demilitarisation'' of Northern Ireland, or the
departure of British troops and the dismantling of the RUC.
Or at least, this is what both sides say the dispute is all about. The
Ulster Unionists, who are boycotting the Washington conference because
of the Adams-Mayhew meeting, think that they are about to be sold out to
Rome (ie Dublin). More detached observers think all these Byzantine
negotiations are an elaborate effort to allow the IRA to save face, to
give up the armed struggle with nothing to show for it that they could
not have obtained a generation ago, just by asking.
At any event, this is what the news line will be. Which is all well
and good, but in fact there is something to the economics story.
For one thing, various American businessmen of Irish antecedents will
be asked to invest in Northern Ireland and the border counties -- some
of them after contributing handsomely to Sinn Fein. One wonders how much
of this is genuine republican fervour, how much a desire to pay off one
of the more active parties in Northern Ireland.
If the latter, that's a good sign, in one respect. It means they do
intend to invest there, and that is the clue to the future, to find jobs
and prospects for all the young men who have nothing better to do now
than hang around in pubs and sing rebel songs.
In another respect, it might be thought better to spend money on more
worthy causes than Sinn Fein. Mr Adams claims that he raised $400,000 or
so at one event in New York two weeks ago, and a steady stream of useful
contributions since then. That would have equipped a nice little factory
in Belfast or Derry.
Baroness Denton explained to the distracted press, as she will explain
to the conference later in the week, that Northern Ireland is an ideal
place for American investment. She admitted that Scotland and Wales
might reasonably object to all the attention being given to investment
in Northern Ireland, but, as they say here, that's the way the cookie
crumbles.
This week's conference is not just about Northern Ireland. There will
be an undercurrent of competition between the North and the Republic.
After all, the same qualities of hard work, reliability, and good
education offered in the North are to be found just as plentifully in
the South -- and wages are even lower and taxes much lower.
Of course, if Americans decide to invest in the Republic rather than
the North, they might very well decide to put their money into Dublin
rather than Donegal, so the competition between regions in Ireland is
not just north-south.
As for politics and the man in the sun,  Baroness Denton said that she
would have no problem shaking him by the hand in the course of the
conference -- and she expected to do so. When you come down to it, this
is a conference about politics, wrapped in economics, not the other way
round.

* WITH heritage blossoming as Britain's key growth industry, it was
only a question of time before they got around to the law. The Galleries
of Justice based at Nottingham's Shire Hall, opened its first phase
before Easter.
The Royal Bank of Scotland chipped in with a #100,000 support package,
and punters can see how prisoners spent lonely nights, watch
re-creations of different aspects of crime and punishment, and move to
the exercise yard and see the gallows where felons were strung up.
Unkind wags have suggested Parliament House as an alternative visitor
centre: the only question mark being whether it is a living museum or
not.
Bastions of the Law (74)
* HE'LL be the barman in the last chance saloon, if the Scottish legal
profession ultimately moves towards losing its powers of
self-regulation.
Garry Watson, 54, is the law round these parts and ain't averse to
letting loose the buckshot over the heads of legal varmints and critters
with the scatter gun he has as legal services ombudsman.
In his first annual report he lambasted the Law Society for delays in
investigating complaints. He wants persistent offenders to be named and
is seeking powers from the Scottish Secretary to recommend payments of
up to #1000 where clients have suffered unduly from a botched
investigation of a complaint.
All of which is pretty tough talking from a chap who made his career
as a chartered accountant and merchant banker with Hill Samuel. That
took him from Glasgow to London and Hong Kong, giving him extensive
experience of the legal profession.
He also had an interest in the legal experiences of Joe Punter,
developed as honorary treasurer for the Citizens' Advice Bureaux in
England and Wales, and latterly with Citizens' Advice Scotland when he
returned here in 1992.
''The corporate user has a certain clout which the individual does
not. Most people get an excellent service from their solicitors, but
there are a number who don't,'' says Watson.
''I don't really see my role as a consumers' champion. I think morally
I have a stronger position if I am seeking to get at the truth rather
than simply being seen to be on one side or another.''
Watson reckons many of problems relate to bad file keeping and
solicitors simply not giving clients early indication of likely fees.
Either way, he supports self-regulation as long as the professional
bodies are committed to first-class handling of complaints, which, by
and large, he says, both the Law Society and the Faculty of Advocates
are . . . but with room for improvement.
* For sheer brass neck, the report highlights one case where a
solicitor sought to charge a complainer for his work in responding to a
Law Society investigation.
''It is hoped that there are not many solicitors who would contemplate
such a practice, but I am certain that it would be a simple matter for
the Law Society to remind its members that this does not represent
chargeable time,'' Watson concluded acidly.
Scouse us
* AN enterprising sheriff clerk, faced with the task of trying to
explain court procedures to potential jurors at Edinburgh Sheriff Court,
began: ''Ladies and gentlemen, for those of you who have been watching
the Brookside trial . . . it's not like that in Scotland.''
Hair today
* IT was one of those courtroom squabbles about identifying the
accused. Witnesses began to give various accounts of the man's
hairstyle. Things were becoming complicated and Sheriff Andrew Bell
asked whether perhaps a hairdresser had been called to give expert
evidence.
''Oh no,'' replied depute procurator fiscal Brian Robertson. ''I would
not presume to take short cuts in your lordship's court.''
Faint Prais
* EDGAR PRAIS QC, always a welcome visitor to this column, makes
another sterling contribution this week. He was appearing in a case in
which the victim of an alleged rape was attempting to bring a private
prosecution. Mr Prais was quoting ancient legal authorities on a point
in the case. He was asked by the court why he was doing this, since that
particular evidence was no longer in dispute.
Mr Prais explained he just wanted to show the court that he had done
his homework. ''You can take it that we are duly impressed, Mr Prais,''
he was assured by Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk.
Bad form
* AN accused appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh with a list of
previous convictions. Nothing unusual in that, except for one offence he
was listed as having been sentenced to 75 years' community service.
Presumably the year was a misprint for hours, since 75 years is a bit
high, even for a sheriff in Kilmarnock or Greenock.
Epilogue
* THE fact that adultery may soon disappear as a legal ground for
divorce in England passes virtually without comment, but all hell breaks
loose when the Bishop of Edinburgh pipes up about Christian attitudes to
extra-curricular couplings. ''The Mirror called me Bishop Bonkers,'' he
mused philosophically, ''but it could have been worse . . . Bonking
Bishop.''

AS we now know, Sir Jerry Wiggin didn't actually do anything wrong.
There was no ''intention to deceive'' and the good knight apologised --
without reservation, mind you -- only because his wholly innocent
actions could just possibly have been open to certain interpretations
and might, only might, have tarnished the otherwise stainless reputation
of the House.
Very good. Yet we can't help but feel that Madame Speaker could do
with a couple of tips when it comes to handling such ticklish situations
in future. How to keep the boys and girls in line? News just in from
Australia might be of help.
Speaking at the Australian Veterinary Association national conference
this week, a Dr Grahame Coleman noted that ''pigs treated more gently by
their handlers -- with an occasional scratch behind the ear or pat on
the back -- are more productive''.
The doctor, presumably unaware that Betty Boothroyd had already let
Sir Jerry off with a cuff round the ear, added that there is ''no need
to treat pigs as pets, but a softer approach helps''. There was one word
of caution. ''Talking to pigs,'' the vet said, ''does not seem to make
much difference''.
Especially, we believe, when their snouts are in the trough.
Bright sparks
IF veterinary science doesn't suit, of course, the Speaker could try
other methods. Consider the report in the Sunday Telegraph which claimed
that Prince William, second in line to the throne, will be
electronically tagged when he goes to Eton in September.
The ST said the lad will wear the device, which is normally used only
to track convicted criminals, so his bodyguards will always know where
he is. If it's good enough for the warm-hearted House of Windsor, surely
it's good enough for loyal Tories?
Stress links
THEN again, prevention isn't the same as punishment, and here America
offers a lead. Home Secretary Michael Howard is already keen on
so-called ''boot camps''; why not take a leaf from Alabama's law books
and bring back chain gangs? As a member of the party of law and order
Sir Jerry would surely be happy to give it a try.
That said, the US experiment has not been without problems. Indeed, an
inmate at the Limestone Correctional Facility in Athens, Alabama,
recently filed suit against Governor ''Fob'' James Jr claiming that
working on one of the state's new gangs violates his civil rights.
Michael Anthony Austin, 29, is asking for $100,000 in damages to
compensate for ''mental anguish, distress or stress of pain and
suffering caused by the discomfort of working on the chain gangs''.
Stressful chain gangs; whatever next?
Fat chance
ANOTHER report from the US also brings Sir Jerry to mind, for some
reason.
At a meeting of the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery in Baltimore
this week a Dr Marc Leventhal reported that more men are having cosmetic
surgery to reduce the size of their breasts, and that at least 4000
American men had such operations in 1993.
A doctor writes: though such procedures rarely are dangerous, in Sir
Jerry's case care should be taken to ensure there is something left
afterwards.
Making waves
WITH broadly the same topic in mind, our spy at Toys R Us notes the
arrival of a new plaything. We understand that the highly educational
''Baywatch Barbie'' differs from the regular model in only a couple of
obvious respects, but is otherwise astonishingly lifelike.
It all adds up
PERHAPS, as some parliamentarians claim, the rewards of the job are
insufficient. To achieve anything in this life you need incentives.
Which may be why US Education Secretary Richard Riley has launched a new
literacy programme.
Quite brilliant in its way, the initiative means that schoolchildren
who keep a promise to read for at least 20 minutes a day will be
rewarded with a coupon for a free ''personal-size'' pizza from Pizza
Hut. That way, at least, they'll be able to read lists of additives.
Beyond compare
AT last it's official: the cheapest capital in which to drink, smoke,
or eat in the European Union is Madrid. The most expensive, meanwhile,
is Helsinki.
London is good for clothes and shoes; Paris terrific for medical
costs. Travel and telecommunications are cheapest in Athens; education
least expensive in Dublin, dearest in Stockholm.
How do we know all this? We know all this because Eurostat, the
European Union's statistics agency, tells us so. It's survey, Cost of
Living Comparisons in the European Union, is a mine of such information.
But how, you might wonder, does Eurostat know? It found out by
analysing three years-worth of data while calculating cost-of-living
adjustments to the salaries of EU officials posted to member state
capitals.
Naturally, they did not consider spending by locals, but looked mainly
at costs to government and business officials ''with a relatively high
standard of living''.
Nice to see they've got something more important than Bosnia to worry
about.
Sitting Members
STILL unable to get good old Sir Jerry out of our head, we hear of a
career opportunity in Monroe, Michigan, that would suit a busy MP down
to the ground.
There, one Mike Pixley, a student at the University of Michigan, is
happily earning $6 an hour. Trained to the highest standard, he comes to
work, sits down, leans back, and relaxes. During busy periods he even
rocks back and forth. Mike tests chairs.
Since May 1, according to The Blade newspaper of Toledo, Ohio, Pixley
has logged 200,000 cycles testing one love seat alone. Going flat out,
he can average about 2800 ''deep rocks'' a day.
Should any parliamentarian be interested, the company wants only
people who are ''self-motivated, who won't get bored, and who set their
own personal goals''. Apply, if you chance to lose your own seat, to the
La-Z-Boy Chair Co.
Time will tell
IN one respect, at least, Tory MPs are more useful than other life
forms.
According to the LA Times breeding the pygmy hippopotamus is even
harder work than breeding posthumous ''love children''.
An official at San Francisco Zoo notes that their male, ''Roly'', has
lived with his mate ''Poly'' since 1969, with no success. ''He'd put it
in her ear,'' said a spokeswoman. ''He'd put it under her arm. In 26
years he never put it in the right spot.''

THE Treasury's panel of six independent forecasters is evenly split on
whether interest rates should be raised to combat rising inflation.
Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Affairs, Professor David Currie of the London Business School, and Gavyn
Davies of Goldman Sachs all think that some further increase in rates
may be needed to keep inflation within the Government's 1% to 4% target
range and that it was a tactical error to leave rates unchanged after
the meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of
the Bank of England.
The others are opposed to a further increase in rates and welcome the
decision not to raise them on May 5.
Professor Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research and Professor Wynne
Godley of King's College, Cambridge, see no need for a change in policy
at the moment, but Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University
thinks that monetary policy is already too tight, that is that he would
favour reducing rates.
The panel of so called wise men, which originally had seven members,
was set up by Kenneth Clarke's predecessor at the Treasury, Norman
Lamont, after Britain was forced to leave Europe's exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992. The primary purpose was to provide
forecasting advice to the Treasury.
For that reason their significance as policy-makers is often
over-stated. The three academics opposed to an increase in rates come
from opposite extremes of economic thought. Congdon and Minford are
staunch monetarists, and Godley is an unrepentant Keynsian.
With no clear message emerging from the deliberations of the wise men
the Chancellor may be encouraged to back his hunches on the economy and
resist Bank of England pressure for a rise in rates on June 7. Recent
indicators have increased the chances of Clarke digging his heels in
again.

THE strong recovery in world stock markets since The British
Investment Trust's March 31 year-end has seen it recoup all of the
losses it sustained during the 12 months.
British Investment, which is 83%-owned by British Coal's staff and
mineworkers' pension funds, suffered a 3.8% decline in net asset value,
from 234p to 225p, in the year to March.
However, with virtually every market in which it is invested having
risen since, the Edinburgh Fund Managers-run trust's net asset value is
now about 238p.
British Investment announced a final payout of 3.1p, resulting in a
7.2% increase in total dividend to 5.2p.
The trust, which has ordinary shareholders' funds of #703m and a #75m
debenture, is 68% invested in the UK and has 10% of its portfolio in
other parts of Europe. Japan accounts for 7%, with the US making up 6%.
British Investment claimed top spot in its peer group of #500m-plus
investment trusts in the Association of Investment Trust Companies'
international general sector, in terms of total return on net asset
value and share price over five years.
Earnings per share powered ahead from 5.22p to 6.06p. However, 0.52p
of this increase arose from the receipt of two years' final dividend
from British Investment's largest holding, Edinburgh Fund Managers, as a
result of timing differences.
Shares moved up 1[1/2]p to 219[1/2]p, in a generally positive sector.

TILL Monday night I still thought I had some inkling what Labour stood
for. I knew, since the amendment of Clause 4, that it had nothing to do
with socialism in any serious sense. But I thought a Labour Government
could always be relied on to spend more than a Conservative Government.
This is a matter of historical experience. Even today, whenever I
listen to the news I hear Labour spokesmen calling for measures which
imply spending more on this, that, and the other.
New Labour, with its lecturers, social workers, and feminists, seems
even more prone to such calls than the Old Labour of horny-handed sons
of toil, who wanted nothing but a bit of subsidy to shore up industries
which they were too idle to make efficient themselves. The production of
bright ideas is more dangerous, especially when those encouraged to have
them think the rest of us will pay for them.
In any event I was always confident that, other things being equal,
Labour must always impose higher taxes because it wished to use taxation
to redistribute wealth rather than just to cover the necessary expenses
of the state.
In a sense, however, what I knew, or thought I knew about Labour was
comforting, because it always meant Labour Governments would fail. The
promises they made to bribe or reward the people supporting them would
easily have accounted several times over for the entire gross national
product. So the promises were broken.
The controls those Governments imposed did away over time with much of
Britain's capitalist enterprise, yet could not replace it by anything
better. As a result, in the era of the welfare state from 1945 to 1979,
Labour never succeeded in narrowing the gap between rich and poor, but
on the contrary made us all poorer than we might have been.
Till Monday night it was reasonable of me to assume that a Government
under Tony Blair, if it ever comes, would turn out much the same. The
very least his fans would expect after their victory would be a billion
or two extra for education, health, and social security. That might beg
the question whether simply spending more money was the answer to the
problems of those services, but the question would never be addressed
before the money disappeared into the pockets of the pressure groups
running them. Labour would again overspend to no purpose.
There would be sterling crises, cuts, strikes, and general mayhem till
the Government collapsed, and the Tories would soon be back for another
16 years.
But Blair has caught me by surprise. In his Mais lecture he set out a
policy which can only be described as one of the strictest fiscal and
monetary rectitude. What was more, he said lower taxation was in
principle preferable to higher taxation. If any faith is to be placed in
politicians' words at all, this can only mean that Blair intends to
disappoint the expectations of his followers in the matter of public
expenditure.
Fiscal conditions are such that there is little scope for raising the
totals spent on major programmes. And policies of redistribution, we
must assume, have in effect been abandoned. If high taxation could not
redistribute, then low taxation is certainly not going to. In other
words, this is a programme which in broad outline any Conservative
Cabinet since 1979 could have subscribed to.
What, then, would change on the advent of a Blair Government? The
straight answer would seem to be nothing, except younger and prettier
faces at the dispatch box. But Blair did direct our attention to the
fact that the real key to all decisions about public expenditure and the
means of financing it lies not in bright ideas of pressure groups or
utopian social visions. It lies rather in the actual growth of the
economy. Without such growth, the rest is irrelevant.
This is indeed an advance in Labour's thinking. Previous Labour
Governments in effect took the view that only after all other claims on
resources had been satisfied could we even begin to think how we might
make our economy grow with what was left, which was usually not very
much. This stood in contrast, for example, to the relatively sensible
outlook of a leftish party like the German Social Democrats, who said
that wealth ought to be created before it was redistributed.
And it is true that John Major's Government has not a good record in
generating economic growth, plunged as it was into a deep recession from
which recovery has proved depressingly slow. With annual growth rates of
2% or 3%, it may well be several years before people again feel as
prosperous as they did under Mrs Thatcher.
That is the prospect that Blair has to change if he is to escape the
dismal fate of previous Labour Governments. He should mark well the
magnitude of the task. As a self-proclaimed long-termist, he might note
for a start that the average growth rate in the British economy has lain
between 2% or 3% since 1870. The only period of notable improvement came
during the 1980s, when we suddenly put on a spurt for eight consecutive
years, an achievement without parallel in our recent history.
How did we do it? The short answer is deregulation. All sorts of
resources, both capital and labour, increasingly misused and wasted up
to 1979, were suddenly freed for more productive purposes. The
dislocations were great, but the results amply compensated for them. The
policy prescription to be derived from our experience is that we should
deregulate still more. Blair, however, in general wishes to impose
stricter regimes of regulation.
In that case, he cannot have higher growth as well. He may have
renounced most of Labour's old shibboleths, but he has still not
renounced enough. Unless he does, his, if it comes, will be another
failed Labour Government.

LORD Mackay pronounced last week that cash limits being imposed on the
legal aid budget for the first time might restrict the future path to
professional advice for many, but unqualified opinion continues to be
available 10-a-penny.
Britain is afflicted with a scourge of unsolicited advice. Despite our
hypocritical pretensions, this is not inspired by noble thoughts of the
brotherhood of man or sisterly solidarity. Rather, we are now a nation
of amateur agony aunts and uncles, forever pronouncing on the business
of others, ignoring the mess of their own lives to offer advice to
people we don't even know.
How Britain loves to gossip. We don't just pontificate on our mate's
mates we analyse the royal marriages, we have vague plans to rescue the
nation, and trouble ourselves endlessly about the trials and
tribulations of minor television characters. For the past few weeks the
country has been in a most outrageous lather about the soap antics of
Beth and Mandy Jordache in Brookside.
Thank God the bar-room philosophers are impotent advisors, otherwise
there would be no drama in our TV dramas, no crises in our sitcoms --
they'd have it all smugly sorted in no time at all.
OK, hands up. All hail hypocrisy. I take a pride in being a
professional nosey parker -- my neb is as long as my nib is sharp. I'm
happy to come clean about that but I get a real giggle out of the closet
gossips. The bruhaha over the past weeks about the marriage of Imran
Khan, the former captain of the Pakistan cricket team, and Jemima
Goldsmith, daughter of the monumentally minted Sir James, was a total
hoot, stopping just short of a broadcast nationwide telepoll on the eve
of the wedding asking ''should she or shouldn't she?''
The Daily Express popped over to Lahore to check that ''Imran's bride
will still find a social whirl'', the Observer fussed over the ''odd
match'' and declared the couple were the Romeo and Juliet of their
times, while the Guardian solicited advice from Muslim leaders and
Khan's ex-girlfriends and worried,''is she doing the right thing?''
Who cares. She's a rich bitch who can take care of herself. Let's face
it, if it all goes hideously wrong she can simply jump on to daddy's
private plane and jet out of Pakistan. Is it possible that the acreage
of advice -- which Jemima most certainly won't have read -- provided a
worthy excuse to revel in the old-fashioned glamour of a wedding between
swarthy stud and young heiress?
A sympathetic tone oft masks prurient interests, making private
problems public domain. Thus, the marital mishaps of Mandy Smith were
reported under the guise of concern over her anorexia, while Gillian
Taylforth, who has barely been out of the media lens since bringing her
spectacularly unsuccessful libel action against the Sun, had to endure
the printed lectures of various agony aunts over her stormy relationship
with her boyfriend Geoff Knight.
Even EastEnders fans wrote to offer her their tuppence-ha'penny worth.
But then, a spot of man trouble brings out the amateur psychologist in
all women, it has us glued to the box throughout the current television
drama The Politician's Wife screaming ''revenge, revenge!'' at the
screen. Even Jane Clarke, a woman universally regarded as a human
doormat for standing dreamily by her husband, the MP Alan Clarke,
despite his confessions (or should that be boast?) of rampant
womanising, joined in the fray. She penned a piece in the Daily Express
which offered advice to the wives of errant politicans.
Mrs Clarke revealed that she had not simply stood by and put up with
Alan's nonsense. No siree. Knowing his fondness for clotted cream and
Channel Island butter she would ''sometimes deliberately not get them''.
Wow, what wrath. Further, Jane reckons a cheated wife should not move
out but should stay in the marital bed and ''keep him awake with a good
noisy sobbing''.
When papers start peddling wisdom like that it's hardly surprising
that next to our zeal for dishing out advice is passion for ignoring it.
We glance at the smoking kills warnings on our cigarette packs as we
light up again and tut-tut over the latest skin cancer scares as we slap
on the suntan cream.
In a crisis I always ask my nearest and dearest what I should do but a
friend recently expressed exasperation when I applauded her years of
wise counsel, pointing out that I never, ever, follow it.
This ask-and-ignore reaction stems from a lifetime weaned on the agony
columns of women's magazines. When I was a girl the Cathy and Claire
column in the Jackie magazine received regular epistles from schoolgirls
narked that their best friend was copying their hairstyle, clothes, and
taste in lipgloss.
They all received the same patronising response: ''Imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery. '' It was clearly crap and everyone rightly
ignored it and dumped the mindless mate, who would promptly come to her
senses and find an identity of her own. Encourage that kind of
''flattery'' and years later she would be sticking a stiletto through
your boyfriend's eye.
Ultimately, we pay scant heed to the advice of others, be it tabloid
polls, public voxpops, or the therapy argot of the glossies, because we
are creatures of instinct. I just wish that I had the instincts of a
pointer hound or homing pigeon rather than those of an ostrich. At the
first sign of trouble I stick my head in the sand. Now, 'scuse me while
I have a quick fag and a wee lie down in the sun.

I AM writing to voice my support for the Tramway, which was so
unfairly attacked by Clare Henry (May 15). The Tramway is acknowledged
throughout the rest of Britain and Europe as a space which shows
exciting and innovative work.
It aims to raise the general public's awareness of a more challenging
type of art by exposure to it and through the accompanying educational
material. The Tramway is used not only by the people of Glasgow but
represents the city in an international context.
Surely there is enough room in Glasgow for a variety of spaces showing
a diversity of works. Unfortunately Clare Henry's review strikes the
arts community of the city as nothing but a grotesque and vitriolic
attack prompted by a personal agenda and far removed from reality.
As a journalist is a position of trust she should not be trying to
undermine the position of trust the curators at Tramway have with
Glasgow City Council by unfair and inaccurate means.

THE departmental changes at the Scottish Office, particularly those
which separate Home Affairs from Health, are a welcome step, especially
for those who are concerned about the administration of justice in
Scotland (Shake-up at the Scottish Office, May 17).
Last year in our response to the review of the Scottish Legal Aid
Board the Scottish Consumer Council called for a separate Department of
Legal Affairs within the Scottish Office responsible for overseeing all
issues to do with the administration of the justice system, including
the courts, legal aid, and the provision of legal services. I am
delighted that the Government has responded positively to this
recommendation.
It would have been even better if the proposed changes could have gone
even further. In recognition of the fact that Scotland's distinct and
separate legal system places the same kind of demand for constant reform
and development as does the English system, the SCC considers that it is
necessary for the administration of justice to be overseen by a
Government minister with no other ministerial responsibilities.
In England and Wales, there is a Minister for Home Affairs as well as
a Lord Chancellor in charge of the courts and the legal system, yet
Scotland's legal system currently has to share a minister with the
National Health Service.
A Scottish Home Affairs Minister would have the time to ensure that
Scotland's legal system continued to be one of which we can be proud. In
particular, a Scottish Minister for Home Affairs could ensure that civil
justice is given proper attention, subjecting the whole system to a
fundamental review.

UNLIKE others one could mention, Alan Shiach declares an interest in
the financial success of the film Rob Roy, being chairman of the
Scottish Film Production Fund, but his efforts to defend the film seem
singularly misconceived.
Certainly he has the right to dispute the validity of William
Russell's film criticism and to quote critic Alexander Walker's support,
but what really riles Mr Shiach is the fact that the majority of critics
have been far from complimentary, citing in particular the wooden nature
of Liam Neeson's acting and the pedestrian nature of the film.
But Mr Shiach denies the film critics the right to make such
judgments. He asserts that when we Scots make a big expensive film
''this single fact demands recognition irrespective of personal
opinion''.
The breathtaking arrogance implicit here is hardly worthy of a person
in a high position in Scottish film production.

SCOTTISH Screen Locations is to be congratulated on the success it has
achieved with Rob Roy and Braveheart. It is gratifying to see that the
Scottish film industry can break into one of the most competitive
industries in the world. Long may it continue!
While there should be no reason why Scotland cannot extend into the
more modern type of film, there must exist a great advantage in
concentrating on films of a historical background. After all, this
ancient nation is steeped in magical history.
Might I suggest that Scottish Screen Locations reaches for the stars
and gets to work on what could be the greatest blockbuster of them all,
Bannockburn?

IT is with utter dismay that I refer to the unbalanced and inaccurate
article written by Anthea Masey (May 13). At a time of disquiet and
great change within the financial services industry, it is imperative
that advisers and the public are informed in a responsible manner.
Anthea Masey's apparent agreement with the Which? report that the
endowment mortgage has been oversold has an element of accuracy.
However, it is completely wrong to suggest that this basis of repayment
is no longer suitable for anyone entering into a mortgage arrangement.
Packaged correctly, and I emphasise this, through a reputable office
with waiver of premium and critical illness benefits, underlying policy
guarantees, realistic percentage basis applied to premiums, and
inexpensive joint life cover, the endowment still offers, in some
instances, excellent value for money.
It may be of interest to note this was borne out by the Office of Fair
Trading report which clearly states that, in the correct circumstances,
the endowment offers an alternative to other means of repayment.
Even more incredulible is Anthea Masey's ability to anticipate
investment returns over the next two decades. There have been too many
ill-informed reporters who take snapshots of a short period of low
inflation and a low-interest-rate environment and roll them over the
next 20 years.
The reality is that only after detailed discussions with clients can
it be established whether a PEP, pension, repayment or endowment
mortgage is the appropriate method, based on circumstances peculiar to
the individual.
It is wholly irresponsible for a person in Anthea Masey's position to
propose that a particular method of repayment is always the correct
route to take.
It is important for people to remember the last two years are
non-reflective of our economic history, which makes the conclusions
drawn by the financial journalist even more fragile.
Finally, I would like to assure the public that the financial services
industry acknowledged some time ago that changes had to be made and, for
those honest enough to admit it, we have seen it move heaven and earth
in a very short time to make the conditions necessary to achieve these
short, medium, and long-term goals.

WITH mounting disbelief I have read the statements of Mr Gerald
Malone, Minister for Health, concerning the nurses' pay issue.
Does he expect the nurses now to believe that the national independent
review body set up in exchange for a no-strike policy has any
credibility after being kicked around by his Ministry and by the
Government?
Does he expect the public at large to now accept that this independent
review has any standing?
Does he really know of the weasel conditions attached to the pay
offers by local hospital trusts?
He he examined the effect on nurses' pay and conditions in the light
of reductions in pay for removal of pay for unsocial hours and public
holidays and, most critical of all, the effect of the new contracts of
employment now being touted round hospitals by managements?
Veiled threats such as those voiced by Mr Malone are beneath contempt.
When levelled at an essential body of carers such as nurses, they are
unworthy of any Government and are clearly orchestrated to party dogma
and intended to demoralise and divide the profession.

JOHN Macleod's article needs clarification in several important areas
if your readers are not to gain an inaccurate picture of the Falkland
Islands (May 16).
A common misconception is that the Falklands were once Argentine and
that the dispute is therefore about Britain ''giving them back''. In
fact, the islands have never been Argentine, their case resting on the
flimsy claim that they inherited the rights which Spain abandoned when
Spain withdrew from the islands in 1811.
Argentina's second argument, which John Macleod implicitly supports,
is that because of the geographic location of the islands Argentine
sovereignty is a matter of common sense. If mere proximity were to be
considered a reason for ownership, many countries, including the UK,
would face severe problems.
The one group that John Macleod overlooks completely is the Falkland
Islanders themselves. The population of 2120 is almost exclusively (96%)
British with a British culture and a British way of life; many of them
are fifth or sixth-generation islanders.
The islands have been under continuous and unbroken British
administration since 1833, apart from the 1982 conflict, right up to the
present day. This cannot be disregarded.
Today the islanders wish for nothing more than their right to
self-determination to be recognised by Argentina and the UN. Since the
conflict of 1982, the Falklands have come financially independent of
Britain in all areas except defence, which takes up less than half of
one per cent of Britain's overall defence budget.
In celebrating Argentina's return to democracy after the bleak days of
military dictatorships, John Macleod would do well to remember the
democratic rights of the Falkland Islanders themselves.

I AM writing with regard to the article ''Pirates clog up vital
channels'' (May 3).
We were delighted that your newspaper carried a report about the
important work the Radiocommunications Agency undertakes in facilitating
access to the radio spectrum and our dialogue meeting in Glasgow with
radio users.
Unfortunately the article unintentionally gave a distorted picture
regarding the use of cell-phones and amateur radio equipment.
The agency would like to make it clear that the frequencies allocated
to the users of cell-phones and radio amateurs are different from those
allocated to the emergency services, and if the equipment is operating
correctly it should not cause any problems of interference.
The agency's own press release stated that there were thousands of
people in Scotland using the airways for business and pleasure, not that
thousands of users were transmitting illegally.
Whilst any piece of radio equipment can potentially cause
interference, contrary to the impression your report may have given the
agency has not received large numbers of complaints in which cell-phones
or amateur radio equipment were responsible for interference to the
emergency services.

YOU can tell a lot from the tone of a press release. Take this one
from Shell, which was faxed to my office yesterday morning.
''Shell UK Limited can confirm that at 6.07 today the company
re-occupied its Brent Star installation which was boarded on April 30th,
without permission, by a group of individuals from the Greenpeace vessel
Moby Dick.''
''We can now confirm that 18 individuals (protesters and journalists)
have been removed from the Spar. As far as we are aware there are
another three trespassers remaining . . . on the upper levels of the
superstructure.''
Shell UK is speaking like a military machine, whose troops are engaged
in the Mother of all Battles. Yet the press release later confirms that
these troops are in actual fact largely sheriff officers and policemen
from Aberdeen. These are officers of the law and the courts, not cannon
fodder for the international oil companies.
Should they really be used to protect multinationals from a rational
and far-reaching debate about the safe and environmentally sensible
disposal of oil installations in the North Sea? That question is far too
important to be the stuff of petty pretend generals puffed up by
self-important press releases.
If Shell managed to ''re-occupy'' their platform without injury to any
individual, or worse, it will be by good luck, rather than good
judgment. No matter how gung-ho the invasion team was, no sheriff
officer should be expected to put life and limb at risk by being dropped
from a crane on to the deck of a North sea platform in a Force 7 gale.
And police officers have enough difficulties to face in protecting our
communities, without expecting them to behave like extras in a James
Bond movie.
And if police and sheriff officers are not to be involved in such
stunts -- and they shouldn't be -- then the oil companies themselves
should be forcibly reminded that their officials cannot act like
vigilantes, seizing back disputed territory by force.
The Greenpeace protest has been entirely peaceful and constructive.
Despite their rhetoric about indefinite occupation, it is likely that
Greenpeace only wished to be in place until the North Sea Conference in
early June when Government Ministers from all the relevant states will
discuss the potential discharge of hazardous substances as a result of
platform disposal. If any action was required before then, a blockade of
supplies could surely have been attempted.
Greenpeace would have done better, incidentally, to put their faith in
the Scottish legal system, rather than appealing to the English High
Court. Shell got their judgment from the Scottish courts, which should
have had a better chance to hear the Greenpeace case, too.
While Shell's managers behave like First World War generals, the wider
community around the North Sea is far from happy about all disposal
plans. The European Commissioner, Ritt Bjerregard, said on Danish TV
last Friday that ''most countries in the EU think that this is dirty and
should be stopped.'' The European Parliament has expressed opposition,
as has the governments of Denmark, Belgium, and Iceland. The British
Government is -- as usual -- alone in trying to favour its friends in
the oil companies, by providing an extra slice of profit for them.
Because amid all the coverage of the Greenpeace invasion of the Brent
Spar one important fact has been ignored. Oil companies were required to
cost into their figures of exploitation the complete removal of
installations.
This is a matter of international law -- The Geneva Convention on the
International Shelf of 1958 says very clearly that ''any installation .
. . must be entirely removed''. The oil companies have already made
financial provision for this task, and their attempts to avoid
undertaking their existing obligations are motivated as ever by money.
The question of disposal versus removal is a complex one. Complete
removal and recycling may be impossible for certain types of
installation. But we do need a full discussion of the matter, not a fait
accompli by the oil companies, enforced by reluctant sheriff officers
and given the nod of approval by the Tory Government. We should be
willing to listen to the North Sea Conference and to other governments.
John Major's new ''listening government'' has fallen again at the first
hurdle.
Neither the North Sea nor the Atlantic Ocean belong to the United
Kingdom, and a time bomb of pollution under the seas will affect not
just the future of our coasts and fisheries, but those of many other
nations as well.
Most countries when they discover oil become filthy rich. We shouldn't
allow Scotland just to become filthy.

IF the by-election in Perth and Kinross is a puzzling affair in some
ways, we should be infinitely glad of it. Within the beautiful and douce
compass of that constituency a variety of views, shaded in a dozen
different ways, has sprung up among the electorate. This tends to make a
mockery of the assertions of conviction politicians, and the overarching
issue which illustrates this perfectly is the argument over the future
of the Union.
This concept must be defined. We live in a united state (the United
Kingdom) but not in a unitary state as the Union represents a shared
sovereignty but the preservation of separate nationhood. These simple
facts have escaped the Prime Minister who persists in a form of fevered
rhetoric which pins Scotland into the position of a subsidiary part of a
unitary nation. This is nonsense and if he had any sense or feeling for
political, or even historical, realities he would realise it. Mr Major
is constitutionally dyslexic, and it seems there is no cure. His reading
of the nature of the bonds between Scotland and England is, therefore,
fundamentally wrong and the conclusions which he draws from this can
only compound the error.
The further conclusion which proceeds naturally is that the real
danger to the Union is not from those who propose democratic devolution,
but from those who demand independence or those who insist on the status
quo. Both are equally dangerous, but in the present context it is the
Conservative Party which is damaging the Union most severely by refusing
to accept that a substantial majority of Scottish people are in favour
of devolution in some shape or form. Lately, it seems, some of this has
managed to filter through to the party leadership. Talks are being
conducted, we hear, with significant figures in Scotland in an attempt
to find some sort of plan to defuse the demand for devolution. Naturally
this will be short of devolution; naturally it will fail. Incidentally,
why is it that whenever the Tories take soundings in Scotland they speak
to businessmen almost exclusively? We do not deny businessmen the
validity of their views, but there is a much wider constituency out
there which is virtually ignored.
If the Tories are the real danger to the Union because of their
misinterpretation of its real meaning, followed by a pig-headed refusal
to consider creative amendments to meet the spirit and demands of the
times, those who demand independence theoretically pose as great a
threat. That this is not the case is illustrated by the latest System
Three poll taken for this newspaper in the Perth and Kinross
constituency. The findings show that 49% of those planning to vote SNP
prefer a Scottish parliament with substantial powers, while only 43%
want a completely independent Scottish parliament. This holds a
painfully obvious message for the SNP for it shows that, while the party
may win the by-election, it has been chosen by a substantial number of
voters who do not approve of independence. Presumably this is because
they regard the SNP as the best vehicle in this constituency to convey
the message of discontent on devolution to the Government. The SNP will
rationalise this lesson and will probably win Perth and Kinross: we
should not deny them their triumph as they have a strong and attractive
candidate. But when the real issues are discussed it seems clear that
the people of Scotland favour devolution within the Union, and woe
betide those who deny it.

IT must be a rare event for the present administration to find any
major proposals greeted (in the main) with approval by those directly
interested or affected by them. That is the case with the ideas advanced
in the green paper published yesterday concerning the rule governing
cross-media ownership. Both the spirit and direction of the proposals
are broadly right and the Government has not felt restricted by its own
regard for free markets, something already attacked by spokesmen for
News International, owners of The Times, Sun, and Today. The markets are
to be regulated in the public interest with rules which ensure diversity
of ownership and thus plurality of opinion. The moves are not designed
to benefit or penalise particular companies but where groups already
control huge segments of the total national newspaper circulation
(defined as 20% of circulation) their ownership of television stations
will be restricted. Papers can own ITV companies outright, and may even
own two, but their maximum audience cannot top more than 15% of the
national total. Two newspaper groups, News International and Mirror
Group, with 37% and 26% of national newspaper circulation respectively,
will find these rules prevent ambitious plans to increase their
television holdings unless they reduce their newspaper titles, which may
presage problems for Today in the News International stable and the
Independent and Independent on Sunday in the Mirror Group.
It is understandable that the two biggest newspaper groups will not be
enthusiastic about proposals which clip their wings; but the rest of the
industry and many who use its products are differently placed. The
excessive concentration of media ownership is not to be welcomed. The
power of the media, but especially of television with its immediacy and
its existence in nearly every living room in the country, can hardly be
denied. It is one of the most striking developments of the age. If, to a
remarkable extent, this power has so far been used with restraint, there
can be no guarantee that that will always be the case. Television
stations do not have the sort of editorial lines and statements of
opinion, of which this article is one, which are common to newspapers,
but linking the two media and allowing their domination by a small
clutch of giant blocs should not recommend itself to those who value the
free play and expression of diverse opinion. These proposals are not an
attack on any existing body or interest but a prudent attempt to
identify the limits of media ownership consistent with a free society.
They represent an exercise in anticipation in that they seek to avoid a
problem before it indisputably exists.
It is good to see a Government committed to the market economy
recognising the market's limitations. The market is itself an essential
element of freedom and choice but its mechanisms can lead to monopoly or
oligopoly unless steps are taken to prevent such developments which are
bound to reduce diversity and inhibit free expression. Even in the
United States where free markets are often thought to reign without
impediment this was recognised a century ago in the Sherman anti-trust
legislation. In this country the control of private monopoly by a
permanent public institution, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, is
of much more recent origin, mainly because British industry was slow to
achieve the degree of concentration common in the US by the late
nineteenth century. That has changed, and the statistical evidence about
a relatively new development like television suggests that the attempt
to prevent the excessive concentration of power has not come too soon.

ALAN BOLD is still fiddling at a tune that lost its melody long ago.
The burden of his song is to convince an innocent audience that Hugh
MacDiarmid is a great poet by persistently associating him with the
finest writers in the nation, notably Robert Burns and Lord Byron
(Weekender, April 13).
Byron and MacDiarmid have only one thing in common: they both betrayed
their class; Byron when he championed liberty for the masses and
MacDiarmid when he advocated mass repression.
Byron is an infinitely superior poet to MacDiarmid, and Burns is
greater than Byron. Of the seven great poets of the romantic era, Byron
is perhaps the least distinguished. Like Wordsworth, he ultimately
failed to achieve unrivalled greatness by a tendency to
over-intellectualise.
Coleridge and Blake are finer poets but they failed for the opposite
reason: a lack of intellectual gravitas when they needed it most.
Blake's pictures are greater than his poetry, and Coleridge's brilliance
is too episodic and goes flat when you expect it to reach the heights
attained by Burns, Keats, and Shelley.
Burns, Keats, and Shelley are the golden trinity of literature in
Britain and each is as great as the other. Their poetry unveils an
almost inexpressible beauty, revealing the luminous paradox dwelling in
the heart of all great literature. All three are comparable to the
greatness of Dante, Virgil, and Homer.
MacDiarmid does not register on that scale of greatness. Thus if Alan
Bold is serious in his assertion that MacDiarmid is one of the world's
great poets, he should compare his work with the acknowledged classics
of poetry; a task he has been reluctant to attempt so far.
No-one can blame him for this. Contrasting the absolute cruelty of
MacDiarmid's Lenin with the divine beauty of Dante's Beatrice would
expose both Bold and MacDiarmid to the charge of philistinism.
If Alan Bold thinks there is greatness in MacDiarmid's poetry he
should illustrate where it lies. Does he imagine greatness dwells in
MacDiarmid's religious worship of tyrants, the drunken dirge, the
prehensile misogyny, the infatuation with cruel men, the deficient
Gaelic, the inept English, the plastic Scots, or is it a Teutonic
synthesis of all these failings?
MacDiarmid is a crude Realist and his writing is, like all forms of
Realism, the posthumous child of nineteenth-century scientific
materialism. When it aspires to being art and not science, it is at best
a form of literary ideology, and that is not poetry at all.
There is precious little public affection for MacDiarmid's verse and
less so among women. It is predominantly men of a certain age who ''kent
his faither'' that have an interest in sustaining his literary
reputation. For the rest of us, he has no future, since his work has no
artistic appeal and is bereft of the common humanity in all great
literature.
A writer untravelled in the realms of gold, MacDiarmid was a kind of
iron poet. His legacy is now rusting in the dust of Scottish literature.
The sooner it fades to nothingness, the sooner Alan Bold will be
unburdened of his penance: to fiddle constantly in the service of a
working-class Nero.

YOU are towing a trailer on a motorway. What is your maximum speed
limit? 40, 50, 60 or 70mph? No conferring and no sneak peeks at the
Highway Code. If it makes you feel any better, only three out of 12
colleagues at The Herald managed to tick the right answer, even though
they had more than 100 years of driving experience between them.
But from now on, the 1.5 million people who submit themselves to the
British driving test each year will have to try harder. The trailer
question is one of five issued by the Department of Transport yesterday
as samples for the new written theory test being introduced in July next
year.
Road Safety Minister Steven Norris yesterday hailed the new test as
having ''overwhelming support from motoring and road safety
organisations''.
One can't help wondering just which organisations he consulted. Within
hours of the announcement the AA, the RAC and RoSPA (The Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accidents) to name but three, were lining up to
lambast the new test.
Adrian Ruck of the AA described it as a ''cheap fix'' which the
Government was rushing through merely to comply with the Second European
Directive on Driving Licences. This requires member states to introduce
a common syllabus for the driving test, including a substantial theory
element from next July. ''Fewer may pass the test in future but it won't
make new drivers any safer on the road. They are the sort of questions
you could teach a monkey to answer,'' said Ruck.
Susan Nicholson for the RAC in Scotland agreed: ''This is only
tinkering around the edges of the problem. At the moment we're teaching
people how to pass the driving test. We're not teaching them how to be
responsible drivers and the new theory test won't change that. Where
they are used elsewhere, they have not had any impact on the accident
statistics for young drivers and that's the area we desperately need to
tackle.''
David Rogers, safety adviser to RoSPA said the society was
disappointed that the changes did not include a hazard awareness and
perception element: ''We know that inexperienced young drivers lack
perceptual and judgment skills. If they don't recognise a hazard or
react in time, they pose a huge threat to other road users.''
Contrary to popular belief, Britain has one of the best road safety
records in Europe, with 7.6 road accident deaths per 100,000 population,
compared with France which has 17 and Portugal with 34. Drivers in the
17 to 25 age group pose the biggest problem in Britain. They are twice
as likely to be killed in road accidents than any other group. Last year
there were more than 1500 road deaths in the 16 to 19 age group alone,
one of the worst records in Europe.
Research carried out at Southampton University for the AA showed that
more than a third of qualified drivers aged 17 to 25 were assessed as
''unsafe''.
The study even came up with a profile of a typical unsafe young male
driver (this is not a problem shared by women in the same age group):
interested in high-risk, thrill-seeking sports, such as hang-gliding and
off-road mountain biking; tends to go out at night with male friends;
thinks a good driver is one who can handle a car and has quick reactions
(rather than someone who is safe and courteous on the road); loves
driving and sees it as giving him freedom, power and satisfaction.
Recognise anyone you know?
It's hard to see how changes to the driving test could screen out
these dangerous ''boy racers'' or even make them less dangerous, when
what is required amounts to an entire culture change. The answer may lie
in interactive video technology. Motoring organisations had been
pressing the DoT for a computerised ''hazard awareness'' test. For
example, it could test the response of a driver to someone walking out
on to the road in front of them, or how they would handle conditions at
night, in bad weather or on motorways -- none of which is covered in the
current test. There could also be a computerised aptitude test to
provide a psychological profile of the learner driver. The technology
exists and has been piloted successfully at the Government's Transport
Research Laboratory at Crowthorne. But the DoT appears to have baulked
at the cost of introducing it.
Instead we are to get the cheapest option on offer. Even this should
substantially increase the swotting element in the test and the
inclusion of questions about safety and driver behaviour is likely to be
widely welcomed. A randomly selected group of six men and six women in
my office yesterday scored between three and five out of five on the
sample test. Both groups scored a total of 23 out of 30, even though
beforehand the men exuded confidence and the women fear.
For now the practical test will remain unchanged, retaining the same
format and length and almost identical content as when it was introduced
60 years ago.

Patrick Brogan examines how genius and ambition have taken Rupert
Murdoch from ownership of one small newspaper to a global media empire
which continues to grow at a prodigious rate
PROFILES of Rupert Murdoch usually devote much space to the question
''What makes Rupert run?'' -- which says something about the unusual
position he has established for himself. After all, there are plenty of
other highly successful people but nobody bothers to ask such questions
about them. What makes Margaret Thatcher run, or Tony O'Reilly, or
Conrad Black, or the head of BP? Who cares, and who is the head of BP,
anyway? All these people are driven by some engine of ambition and a
startling combination of abilities and energy that propel them far ahead
of the rest of us. The thing is not to attempt the fruitless task of
breaking down this combination into its component parts, but to see what
the man, or woman, has made of his abilities.
This is a good moment to have a look at Murdoch, because he is
evidently embarked upon another of his expansionary phases.
Repeatedly over the years he has gone through periods of wildly buying
new properties -- in newspapers, publishing, broadcasting, or the movies
-- followed by a period of relative calm during which he digested his
new acquisitions.
The last expansion left him seriously over-extended and almost led to
the destruction of his empire: he came within a hair's breadth of
bankruptcy in 1991. The trouble then was that he had made one purchase
too many, buying the Triangle Press from Walter Annenberg for $3
billion, and launched one venture too many, Sky TV.
Triangle (a series of American magazines) was worth only half what he
paid, and he lost a fortune on it (he eventually sold all but one of the
magazines, TV Guide, for a fraction of what he had paid), and the
initial losses on Sky almost pushed him over the edge.
Almost, but not quite. He had the skill, the patience, and the
reputation to survive the crisis. Robert Maxwell sank under the weight
of his debts at the same time, partly because he lied to his bankers.
Murdoch never lied and the bankers trusted him, and bailed him out.
Now Murdoch's 40% share of BSkyB is worth $2.7 billion, and the
service is hugely profitable. His debts have been reduced sharply, most
of his businesses are very profitable, so he can borrow again, on a vast
scale. A deal he has just concluded with an American telephone company,
MCI, has put $1 billion in his pocket, with the promise of another
billion later.
He is buying television networks in Italy, he is expanding in Eastern
Europe and may well extend his European television holdings elsewhere --
but that's small beer. Don't be surprised to read that he has bought
CNN, or launched some immense television enterprise in Latin America.
There was a rumour the other day that he was once again interested in
the Financial Times (remember that Pearson's, which owns the FT, is
Murdoch's partner in BSkyB). The secret is, don't put anything past him.
News Corp is worth about $20 billion, with debts of about $5 billion,
and he could easily double it by the end of the century.
The rise of Rupert Murdoch continues.
He was born in Australia in 1931. His family was half Scottish, half
Irish. His father, Sir Keith, was the most important newspaper baron in
the country, but he was an employee, not a proprietor -- a mistake
Rupert took care never to repeat. Keith contrived to buy a few, small
papers as a legacy to his son, but his widow had to sell all but one
when he died. Rupert thus inherited the Adelaide Daily News (all his
companies ever since have been called News).
Murdoch did a stint at Oxford and despised it (Bill Clinton, also,
came away from that university disliking its snobbery).
Perhaps his continuing anglophobia derives from that experience,
perhaps it was just his natural antipathy to establishments. The British
class system still requires deference, and Murdoch defers to no-one. He
expects others to defer to him. When his father died, he took over the
News and set to work to build his empire. First Australia, then Britain,
then America, then the world.
Australia was a rough place and Murdoch had to battle a series of
aggressive newspaper companies, including his father's old firm, before
becoming the pre-eminent media power down under. Nothing was ever given
to him, except the Adelaide News, and he is still fighting.
He finally won control of the Melbourne Herald, the flagship of his
father's company, in 1986 and installed himself in his father's old
office. He is not a sentimental man. As part of the deal, he sold his
first paper, the Adelaide News, and a few years later he closed the
Herald. He now owns over 70% of the newspapers and magazines in
Australia.
By then, he already bestrode the narrow world like a colossus.
He went to London and bought the News of the World and the Sun in
1969. The Murdoch revolution began immediately: sleaze, sensationalism,
exposing corruption, naked ladies, xenophobia -- and brilliant editing
and news sense -- made the Sun the phenomenon of modern newspapers.
He had already moved on America, buying the New York Post and starting
the super-trash tabloid Star in the mid-70s. By that time, he was
already running newspaper empires on three continents, with outlying
colonies elsewhere.
He bought the Times and Sunday Times from the palsied fingers of the
Thomson family in 1981, and five years later won his famous victory over
the print unions at Wapping. It was one of the two titanic battles that,
we are told, he remembers with most pride.
The other was launching Sky.
A consortium of the great and the good (and the rich) promised to
launch their own satellite service, BSB, but Murdoch got there first. He
worked harder, and pushed his staff harder, and he had Sky up and
running a year before his rival. It cost him a fortune and the losses
were staggering -- but he drove the competition into the ground.
He would have won a total victory, wiping out BSB, if the fight had
not coincided (and partly caused) the near-death experience of 1991. He
was obliged to accept a deal to merge Sky with BSB.
These two battles, Wapping and Sky, were cases of the rewards that go
to someone who is prepared to back his own judgment to the limit -- and
has the nerve, skill, and wit to succeed. Above all, he has to get
everything right. This is the genius of the man. He gets it right.
William Shawcross, who wrote by far the best biography of Murdoch,
says that he is modest, charming, frugal in his personal habits, and
rather a puritan. In 1992, he gathered the senior executives of all his
far-flung properties at Aspen, in the Colorado Rockies.
A young man he had appointed to head Fox television, Stephen Chao,
thought everything was permitted. The network was at last profitable,
partly because of the smutty shows Chao had introduced, and he gave a
talk on the future of television, and illustrated it with a male
stripper.
Murdoch, whose wife was in the audience, was not amused and fired Chao
on the spot. A man who took Fleet Street so far downmarket, and who
started trash TV, would not have his wife offended.
So what happens next? Murdoch started out as a newspaper man, and the
print media still comprise over 60% of his empire, but his future is in
electronics.
His most far-reaching successes have been Sky television and the Fox
network in the United States. He built Fox out of the Hollywood studio
and a block of TV stations be bought during that great expansion in the
1980s. Fox is now closing in on the big three networks.
The combination of television and movies makes him the most powerful
media tycoon in the country, and his European and Asian TV companies
multiply that influence.
He decided recently not to bid, or rather to submit a derisory bid,
for Britain's Channel 5. Perhaps he concluded that it wasn't worth it,
that BSkyB gives him all the power he needs in Britain.
He owns the rights to broadcast British and American football, and
other sports, too, so why spend millions on a ground-based TV channel
which would compete with BSkyB?
At any event, Fox itself and the alliances he has formed with Disney,
MTV, Turner (owner of CNN), and other American TV networks gives him
unparalleled programming. What can the BBC offer in competition? What
has happened in Britain is that the Government, consciously or not, has
allowed Murdoch to obtain a position that no media baron has ever
enjoyed and he may now bury the national broadcasting corporation
itself.
It remains a matter of mystery that any self-respecting independent
country should allow a foreigner to take over a third of its newspapers
and much of its television, use the powers he thus acquired to degrade
its public life and attack its central institutions, and then use the
money these achievements made for him to move on to greater things.
This, after all, is the classic colonial experience. Once upon a time,
it was the British who bought and sold foreign governments, industries,
and institutions. Serve us right, I suppose. One is tempted to blame it
directly on Mrs Thatcher, who consciously allowed Mr Murdoch a free hand
in exchange for political support.
Larry Lamb, then editor of the Sun, used to boast that he made her
Prime Minister in 1979 and that she was properly grateful.
So far, no Government has ever stood up to him, and there are no very
encouraging signs that a Labour Government would be any less subservient
than the present one. After all, the Labour Government in Australia is a
wholly owned subsidiary of News Corp.
The difference now is that instead of taking on, and vanquishing, one
government he is conquering entire continents.
BSkyB reaches 4 million homes in Britain, though no doubt it will soon
reach everyone. Star television already reaches 50 million in Asia, and
should hit 90 million by the end of the year.
The satellite that broadcasts its programmes has a ''footprint' that
covers two-thirds of the earth's population, including the entire
eastern Pacific and everything west to Moscow and Cairo.
There may not be much advertising revenue per viewer in Asia compared
with revenues from network TV in America, but the sheer numbers will
make up for that.
The latest known battlefront has just opened in the United States and
no-one knows quite what to make of it. Telephone companies, who have an
enormous amount of money and access to every house in the country, are
going into partnership with TV companies.
The idea is to replace broadcast signals and cable TV with a combined
TV and telephone service -- which, of course, will include the
information superhighway, interactive media, and all the other
excitements that are just hovering on the horizon.
Murdoch will be there, selling pay-per-view movies and TV shows (he
already owns the computer companies and networks he needs), through
MCI's phone lines. Meanwhile, he will sell the same services in Europe
through the Astra satellite and in Asia with Star.
Murdoch would never have got so far without being ruthless and
dictatorial: there are scores of dismissed editors and executives, in
four continents, who once enjoyed the sun of his favour and were
suddenly cast into the darkness. He has just sacked the head of his
British enterprises, August Fischer, a brilliant administrator, and
replaced him with one of his Australian heavies. Even Kelvin MacKenzie
and Andrew Neil have been cast forth.
Some of his employees mutter, sotto voce, that this is all very well,
but what will happen if he drops dead, leaving the company to his wife
Anna and a bunch of yes men?

Jennifer Cunningham lifts the lid on fresh fears about the shelf life
of food.
MANY a traveller's or adventurer's tale hinges on surviving on elderly
tins of sardines or peaches. Best known are the baked beans taken to the
Antarctic by Captain Scott and eaten 46 years later by his son, Sir
Peter Scott. Canned foods used to be regarded as indestructible.
In the past two years, however, all cans of food have had to carry a
best before label, which gives them a shelf life of between six months
and a year. Deep frozen and long-life foods and certain cheeses also
have to display date markings under the Food Labelling (Scotland)
Amendment regulations, while highly perishable foods have to carry a
''use by'' date.
Unless stranded without supplies, few people would choose to eat soup
which had been canned almost 10 years ago, especially when Heinz is
rolling them off the production line at 700 a minute. Yet Bashir and
Shahin Malik had enough out-of-date stock in their shop in Airdrie to
fill 15 bin bags, when environmental health officers removed it to the
tip. The sheer volume astonished shopkeepers, wholesalers, and
environmental health officers alike yesterday.
Most people's immediate response was: ''If it was a few months out of
date you could understand it, but not several years.'' Many of the goods
removed from the shop in Cairn View, Airdrie, had no date. They were
dated by asking the manufacturers to trace their code on the tin or
packaging. It is possible then that it could be a genuine mistake caused
by failure to keep tight enough control over stock turnover, to make
sure the oldest stock was always sold first.
The possibility raised by Monklands MP Helen Liddell, however, that
there could be a supplier of outdated foods, was echoed by others.
Spokesmen for two major Glasgow wholesalers, who were unwilling to
reveal their names, said they did not think there was such a supplier in
Scotland, but there were people in England who offered goods including
foodstuffs in ''job lots for fantastic prices'' and those could contain
out-of-date items.
One suggested that when food near its sell-by date was collected for
refugees and victims of war such as those in Bosnia, any that was
already out of date might be set aside and find its way into the wrong
hands. The age of the food in the Airdrie shop makes that particular
chain of events unlikely in this case.
Robert Taylor, assistant director of environmental services at
Edinburgh district council, said he had only once come across someone
selling 10-year-old products and that had been a very old lady with a
very low turnover. ''Some had labels I had never seen before, going back
to the Second World War, but it was not the sort of situation where you
would want to prosecute, where someone was deliberately selling unfit
produce,'' he said.
''We have had a number of prosecutions recently involving dry goods
six months over their best-before date and cooked meats over date which
can be more dangerous,'' he added. The main foodstuffs which are not
labelled are now those sold loose in wholefood shops. According to Mr
Taylor: ''They require even stricter hygiene because not only may they
become less wholesome but can be subject to infestations, for example
with moths or weevils, and also need to be subject to strict stock
control, with first in being first out.
Mike Jackson, Professor of Environmental Health at Strathclyde
University, is sometimes called in to investigate food but usually after
there has been an outbreak of food poisoning and its source has to be
traced.
''While foods being edible 10 years after being tinned are not
unknown, it is not a question of whether they are unsafe, but it is bad
practice and poor food management. The best-before date is decided on
the basis of how long the food will remain in a satisfactory condition,
not only in not causing food poisoning, but also in taste, look, and
smell because the chemistry of the food is altered. How long that would
take would depend on what was in the tin,'' he said.
''There has been a big improvement in recent years in the storage and
display of foods, particularly perishable items such as dairy foods.
Very often good hygiene goes hand in hand with good presentation and we
have seen in the larger stores especially a recognition of this in
improvements in refrigerated display cabinets. If they are seen to be
clean, people are more likely to buy the things in them, and so they are
more likely to be cleaned,'' he said.
Tales of supermarkets chucking food out of the back door to be picked
up by the hungry and the homeless because it had reached its sell-by
date without being sold on a Saturday evening may once have been true.
Sophisticated, computerised stock control means that very little now
remains unsold. Individual store managers at Tesco and Sainsbury have
the discretion to reduce the price of perishable goods on their sell-by
dates and both say they destroy any food which is past its use-by date.
Both of them and Marks and Spencer say they sell food very close to its
use-by date to staff at a reduced price or use it in the staff
restaurant. Marks and Spencer says anything still remaining will be
given up to its use-by date to a local charity chosen by staff such as a
hostel for the homeless or women's refuge, provided they have suitable
food storage.
The wholesalers say they return tinned and dry food to the
manufacturers two months before the sell-by date and dairy goods a week
before. So where do the ''job lots'' come from? Environmental health
officials would like to hear from anyone who knows.

UNOFFICIAL sources in Dublin yesterday confirmed that one of three men
arrested by Garda Special Branch officers on Monday is Mr Adam Busby,
47, self-styled leader of the Scottish National Liberation Army.
As news of the detention of the men under Section 30 of the Ireland's
Offences Against the State Act emerged, the Crown Office in Edinburgh
said they would not comment as there was an outstanding warrant from
Grampian Police for Mr Busby's arrest.
Sources in Dublin said the arrests could have been in connection with
possible explosives offences. The Irish Gardai confirmed the men could
be detained for 48 hours without charge.
They will be forced either to charge the detainees or release them
today.
Strathclyde Police launched a move in April to start extradition
proceedings to bring Mr Busby back to Scotland from Dublin where he has
lived since allegedly breaching bail here 12 years ago.
At that time, he faced a charge of daubing a slogan on a military
lorry in Northumberland after a rally. On a previous occasion, a Dublin
court refused a bid to have Mr Busby extradited.
The Grampian Police warrant, issued to them last autumn, was believed
to be in connection with an investigation into alleged terrorist
offences.
The SNLA has been blamed over the years for sending letter bombs to
politicians and committing hoaxes. All of the bombs were either
intercepted or defused.
Earlier this year, the SNLA claimed to have sent out six letter bombs
timed to coincide with Labour's Scottish conference in Inverness.
One was addressed to Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, one
went to Labour leader Tony Blair's home in Durham, and a third to Labour
Party headquarters in Walworth Road, London. None went off.
One man closely associated with the SNLA, Mr David Dinsmore, also fled
to Dublin in 1984 while accused of sending a letter bomb to Lord
Mansfield, then a Scottish Office Minister. He returned to Scotland last
year, pled guilty to the charge, and was given 250 hours community
service.
In January this year, a claim was made by a caller from Dublin to the
Press Association that the SNLA had made a death threat to Mr Ian Lang,
the Scottish Secretary, on his home telephone in Scotland.
The caller claimed the SNLA had access to a number of unlisted numbers
of politicians, senior police, and military officers and Strathclyde
Police carried out an investigation.
The force refused to comment yesterday on the events in Dublin. Mr
Busby and the two Irishmen, now detained at Fitzgibbon Street Police
Station, all gave Dublin addresses.

Benedict Brogan reports how the Government is making a stand against
the small band of media moguls who have captured a huge slice of the
British press and broadcasting market.
THERE is a simple, thoroughly political question behind all the
complexities of cross-media ownership: is it healthy for a democracy to
have all its press and broadcasting in the hands of a small number of
very rich foreigners? Yesterday the Government decided it isn't.
The Conservatives have trod carefully around this subject since it
first arose under Margaret Thatcher during Rupert Murdoch's take-over of
the Times and the rest of the Thomson newspaper stable. Ever since, they
have struggled in the shadow of the predator Australian-turned-American.
They love his firm, globalist approach to free markets. They are
desperate for the votes his tabloids can deliver. But they would rather
not be seen in public with him.
Yesterday, with the flexible approach to regulation introduced by
Stephen Dorrell's green paper, the Government closed the door on Murdoch
and Silvio Berlusconi and Ted Turner and the other media empire builders
looking for a piece of the deregulated British market.
It is a potentially brave step. For John Major and Heritage Secretary
Dorrell, Rupert Murdoch, above all the others, is the cuckoo in the
nest. Allowed in by Thatcher, first into newspapers (he controls 35% of
national titles), then satellite television (he owns 40% of BSkyB), he
is now a dominant force in British media, and wants to be even bigger.
Dorrell may have emphasised the importance of widespread consultation
yesterday. But however many organisations and individuals are consulted
for the preparation of the White Paper that will follow, Murdoch's views
-- until yesterday at least -- looked set to matter most.
The head of News Corporation has always played down his influence. On
BBC2's Money Programme on Sunday he trivialised his contacts with
Ministers since Thatcher: ''They were never very good then and they're
not very good now; not that they're very bad, I just don't happen to
know them.'' And he may be a conservative, he said, but ''that doesn't
mean to say I'm a supporter of the Tory party.''
But no contact is necessary for the Government to know that Murdoch
thinks his share of the British market -- at a spot over 10% -- is
trivial. The market, he argues, is limited enough without the Government
handing ''the world to the BBC''. Britain is paranoid and small-minded
about him. ''Let people get out there and compete with us,'' he says.
His complaints of unfairness were accompanied by an unequivocal ''or
else'' for the Tories; he has not yet decided who the Sun will endorse
at the next General Election. Coming from the man who said he could
imagine himself voting for Tony Blair, Sunday's interview will have
worried Tory Central Office.
Stephen Dorrell has ignored the warning and opted for defending a
plurality in British media outlets. Policy, he said, ''must underpin the
diversity of viewpoint that is necessary in any healthy democracy'' by
guaranteeing against a monopoly of ownership. And it must also allow the
industry to keep up with the dramatic evolution in technology and
markets.
He has responded to demands from newspaper and television companies by
allowing greater cross-ownership. The Daily Mail, for example, will be
able to buy up to two ITV franchises. But News International will be
prevented from buying into television, and the Mirror Group will not be
able to keep its stake in Scottish Television without giving up some of
its newspaper titles.
The balance achieved by the Government in its approach left Labour
little choice yesterday but to welcome the proposals. Shadow Heritage
Secretary Chris Smith did find some questions, however, notably about
the impact on regional broadcasting.
''If national newspaper companies with a national focus and interest
now seek to take over regional ITV stations, is there not a serious
danger that the regional character of those stations could be harmed?''
he asked.
Brian Wilson, the Highlands' media mogul, expressed cautious optimism.
After asking if this meant he could buy up the Stornoway Gazette, the
publisher of the West Highland Free Press and MP for Cunninghame North
said: ''It is a modest step in the direction of diversity. There will
obviously be needs for safeguards against regional monopolies.''
There is room for a smidgen of sympathy for Rupert in all this. His
bafflement at the British obsession with who owns things, rather than
the jobs they create and the consumer choice they bring, is
understandable. If Britain really does believe in free trade, then
where's the problem? ''There's something awfully wrong with Britain when
someone comes in and works hard and competes and they're successful and
is a catalyst for change. Look at the newspaper industry today. Who did
that? Is it better or worse?'' he asks.
A good question. For independent newspapers such as this one,
competing against Murdoch's cut-price, loss-making 20p Times, the answer
is worse. What is pooh-poohed as healthy competition by Murdoch is
looked upon as potentially fatal predatory pricing by the regional
press.
For the Tory party, whose MPs have suffered a battering at the hands
of News International's five sleaze-hungry titles, the answer is also
worse. It is always dangerous to read too much into the motives of
politicians, but behind the Government's commitment to preserving a
healthy, pluralistic press, could this just be one in the eye for
Rupert?

FOLLOWING a chart of who owns what in Britain's media is a bit like
looking at a plate of spaghetti tossed against a wall. There are an
awful lot of strands to follow, and it is not always clear where they
are going.
Whether the Government's green paper will help clear up the mess or
simply add more spaghetti will take longer to unravel.
The largest strand to follow is that of News International, the UK
subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's international conglomerate News
Corporation. It has the largest share by far of Britain's national
newspapers -- so big in fact that left-wing commentators continually
moan that Murdoch's newspapers have too large a say in the political
attitudes of its readers.
It was the Sun which put the Tories back into power so often,
according to the popular view of events, by ridiculing Labour, and
convincing working-class voters in the south of England that they would
be better served by voting Conservative.
Many in the Labour Party have wanted News International's power to be
curbed. Ironic, really, that the Government's green paper would appear
to do just that. NI's three daily papers, the Sun, Times and Today, have
nearly 36% of the national market between them. Its Sunday share, with
the Sunday Times and News of the World, is even higher at 38%. It also
owns 40% of the satellite company BSkyB.
It puts News International well above the 20% level which stops it
buying into television companies. The company believes it is being
penalised for being successful. As a company spokesman rather sniffily
put it: ''The message is: stop investing in expansion and increase
prices to hold back circulation.''
Hints were also made that it would have to consider the position of
papers which, by losing money, add to the percentage of market share,
but not to the profits. In other words, News International may divest
itself of some of its titles to reduce market share while having little
effect on profits.
But to shed titles in order to go below the 20% figure seems a huge
step, even for such a media gambler as Rupert Murdoch.
The other newspaper group to suffer from the 20% ruling is Mirror
Group Newspapers, owners of the Daily Record in Scotland, the Mirror,
and 43% of the fragile Independent newspaper. That gives it 23.8% market
share, although bitter and twisted rivals will say it is heading down
towards the 20% figure anyway.
The green paper will be a particular disappointment for Mirror Group
because of its 20% stake in Scottish Television. It cannot proceed with
a bid for Scottish, not only because of the 20% rule, but also a
separate proposed ruling that no newspaper group, even if it has less
than 20% of the national market, can own a television company if it has
30% of the local regional market -- which the Daily Record has with
consummate ease in central Scotland.
Consequently, Scottish Television's share price fell yesterday as,
with no sign of a bid on the horizon, speculators are taking their money
elsewhere. Provided the share-price drop does not continue, Scottish
Television's directors will not be too unhappy as it makes the future of
the present regime more secure.
Not that the Mirror Group themselves will necessarily disappear from
Scottish. The two companies are talking about making cable programmes
together, and there is nothing in the green paper to stop Scottish
pursuing co-operation with other local media companies, a Scottish
spokesman pointed out.
The winners in the green paper would, therefore, appear to be the
companies below the 20% threshold, but still with sufficient financial
clout to consider pushing further into television. The most obvious one
is Associated Newspapers, owners of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, and
London Evening Standard. It has 15% of daily national share, and already
owns 20% of West Country TV and a cable station.
Just below them is United Newspapers, owners of the Daily Express,
Daily Star, and Sunday Express, with 14% daily national share. It has no
television interests at present.
Pearson's, owners of the Financial Times, and 14% of BSkyB, is known
to want to expand into television.
In television, the two big companies are Carlton, owners of Carlton
TV, Central TV and shareholdings in GMTV and ITN, and then Granada,
owners of Granada TV, LWT, and shareholdings in BSkyB, ITN,
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and GMTV.
There are 15 television companies, divided into nine large and six
small. Scottish is the smallest of the large companies. As it stands
alone there is nothing to stop a takeover from any other company which
only has one television station, or indeed any company whatsoever, as it
is a publicly quoted company -- apart from News International and Mirror
Group that is.
But attention is bound to concentrate on the larger television
companies. If you can only own two you had  better make them as big as
possible, would appear to be the current market thinking.
Which only leaves the question of why do newspapers want to own TV
companies? The heady days of easy profits have been left behind. Badly
handled takeovers could leave profitable newspapers being bled dry to
pay for injudicious forays into television land.
Others will argue that news itself is a commodity. Delivering the same
news to people through different outlets as a hedge against any one
technology becoming too dominant would appear attractive to many.
Profits may well be out there to be made. But losses could be just as
inevitable.

ON the day Nelson Mandela was released from prison, a multitude
assembled in Cape Town to hear him speak.
Just before he appeared on the balcony of the ornate Town Hall,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu appealed to the crowd for silence.
When the hubbub subsdided, you could have heard a pin drop in the sea
of upturned black, white and brown faces. Tutu called them the Rainbow
People, and he hailed their silence as the sound of peace.
After decades of apartheid, it was at once a memorable image of racial
harmony and a symbol of hope for the future. The fact that black and
mixed race South Africans will be cheering their heads off in support of
their all-white rugby team in its opening World Cup match against
Australia tomorrow is a demonstration of how far their country has come
in the intervening five years.
Against all the odds, Mandela and his multi-racial cabinet have forged
a genuine democracy in a society devastated by generations of racial
oppression.
It is an achievement little short of miraculous and the staging of the
biggest international sporting event in the republic's history is of the
utmost importance to maintaining the momentum of peaceful development.
The Rugby World Cup not only sets the seal on the country's
re-integration into the international community, it is a showcase which
its organisers hope will promote tourism and foreign investment badly
needed by a fragile economy.
Dismantling the ivory tower of white supremacy has not rid South
Africa of the evils of apartheid. The vast majority of its black
citizens still live in conditions of relative squalor, with little
prospect of decent homes, regular jobs, and a good education for their
children.
Mandela has appealed to them for patience but it may take generations
to redress the racial balance in economic and social terms.
This is where a successful Rugby World Cup, by highlighting the
attractions of South Africa, could play a vital role in speeding up the
process.
A few miles from the Newlands stadium in Cape Town, where the opening
match takes place, there is a house without windows. Its wooden door is
the most solid feature of what Selina Mbalo calls her ''house'' -- in
reality an army tent, where she has been living for years with her son,
her brother and sister-in-law, and a fluctuating number of infants.
The view from the door is of a sea of flimsy wooden and corrugated
iron shacks in a dusty wasteland, an enduring image of the ''old'' South
Africa.
Selina is waiting for a low-cost brick bungalow to become available
for rent or purchase and in the meantime, she keeps her tent as clean
and habitable as humanly possible.
The ''living room'', curtained off from sleeping areas, has a couch
with a hand-woven cover and a threadbare carpet. A vase of fresh flowers
sits on a side-table.
The black township of Crossroads where she lives is the kind of
environment where one might expect hostility towards whites in their
affluent suburbs a few miles away. However, even before apartheid was
dismantled, apart from a few highly-politicised youths, bitterness was
curiously absent.
Most residents are good-natured people with three priorities -- a
decent place to live, a steady job, and a proper education for their
children.
Few of them can afford tickets for the World Cup games but if the
competition helps them to realise their goals, so much the better.
Selina's brother Jack summed up their attitude shortly before the
country's first multi-racial elections.
He said: ''I think it's important that every person should vote,
because if you have a white man in power he will look only on his side,
and if you have a black man he will look on his side, so you need the
two to look after everybody.''
Jack has a sympathiser in the unlikely form of Pieter ''Hempies'' du
Toit, a farmer and former Springbok prop forward whose international
career was stifled by apartheid. Outwardly, Du Toit is the
quintessential rural Afrikaner, strong, independent, and devout,
powerfully influenced by the pioneering spirit of his forefathers.
He is descended from the Huguenots, protestants who fled religious
persecution in France and settled in the western Cape in 1688. At his
farm near Stellenbosch, he produces Alto Rouge, a robust dry red estate
wine and one of South Africa's oldest.
Du Toit was among the first Afrikaners to question the immutable
truths of his privileged childhood. The doubting process began when he
was invited to add his considerable stature and skill to a rugby team of
young coloured players.
As a child, the farm labourers had called him klein baas (little
boss), and as he grew older he became meneer (sir).
''When I played for that team, the others called me by my first name.
That was the first step. When you're in a team, everybody is equal and I
realized I had no right to be called sir. That was a turning point in my
life.''
The next learning experience occurred during a controversial Springbok
tour of New Zealand in 1981.
He said: ''I remember thinking what a great country it was and how
alike the people were to South Africans, pioneering people who had built
up the land from nothing. Then I looked at the Maoris, and what had
happened to them, and thought of the blacks in my own country. I felt
depressed.''
His perception that something was fundamentally wrong in South African
society crystalized into attempts to improve it, while apartheid was
still in place, by enhancing the prospects of his workers' children.
For years, he has been providing interest-free loans for schoolbooks
and uniforms, insisting on quarterly reports from their headmaster and
awarding prizes to the best pupils.
He views the Rugby World Cup with a mixture of pride and regret. There
is sadness that it came to South Africa too late for him to participate
-- he is now 41 -- but there is also satisfaction that it reflects a
more just society in the country he loves.
''I think it is important because it shows that justice is being done
in South Africa,'' he said yesterday.
''We have a long way to go but there is a lovely atmosphere around the
World Cup that shows how people are pulling together to tackle our
problems.
''I've always felt that rugby could do a lot to bring people together
and now it is happening. Our black people will not be cheering the
opposition any more. The unity is wonderful.''
Du Toit's abiding concern is spiralling violent crime, which has
spilled out of the townships to engulf affluent neighbourhoods. The gulf
between rich and poor is still enormous, and white households still
shelter from its consequences behind a panoply of guns and razor wire.
Thus the Rugby World Cup could go horribly wrong. A high-profile
killing of a tourist by armed robbers could wreck all the endeavours to
promote international goodwill and economic development. That would be a
shame, because South Africa both needs and deserves the event to
succeed.
There have been teething troubles,notably concerning the availability
of tickets and catering arrangements at official functions. Initial high
hopes of a massive boost to the economy have receded, with the South
African Tourist Board reducing its estimate of World Cup visitors to
around 26,000.
But already the competition is proving hugely popular, with big crowds
gathering at airports and lining highways to view the arriving teams.
The overseas players have been doing their bit by staging rugby clinics
in black and mixed race townships, providing a day to remember for
legions of little boys in tattered shorts.
There is regret that the Springboks have only one coloured player, who
is unlikely to play because of injury.
However, a substantial proportion of ticket receipts and advertising
revenues, amounting to millions of pounds, has been earmarked for the
development of sports in the townships, raising hopes of a multi-racial
South African team in the near future.
There is no question that such efforts will be backed to the hilt by
Steve Tshwete, the sports minister, who is a rugby fanatic.
During his incarceration with Mandela on Robben Island prison, Tshwete
kept up the spirits of their African National Congress comrades and
bemused their guards by organising regular matches.
Another powerful incentive for success is Cape Town's bid to stage the
2004 Olympic Games.
The Rugby World Cup is thus regarded as a dress-rehearsal, aimed at
proving South Africa can host the world's biggest sporting event.
Old habits die hard, however. Rugby in South Africa is still widely
regarded as a white man's sport, with soccer the undisputed national
passion of its black citizens. In the dusty streets of Soweto, there is
more interest in the local Orlando Pirates' bid to reach the final of
the Africa Cup than in international rugby.
Whether the World Cup changes such attitudes remains to be seen. At
least revenues from the competition will give township youngsters a
chance to compete on level terms for a place in a future South African
team. And if all goes well, economic spin-offs from the event will
improve their prospects for a decent life.
Much will depend on what happens off the playing fields in the next
month. For the Rainbow People, there is more at stake than who wins the
championship on June 24.

<FLAG>GENERAL ASSEMBLY,</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>978239679</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IT would take eight years at a conservative estimate to produce a new
edition of the Church hymnary, the Assembly was told yesterday.
The Rev John Bell, convener of the Panel on Worship, said all 700
items in the present hymnary -- the 3rd edition, known as CH3 -- were
being evaluated and this would take a year before other work could be
tackled, including questions of copyright and submissions from composers
throughout Britain.
Mr Bell is also convener of the Church Hymnary Revision Committee
formed by members from the Church of Scotland, the Presbyterian Church
of Wales, and the United Free Church of Scotland, with observers from
the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.
He said it was planned to make the new hymnary a ''proper book'' which
would contain ''the core hymns in our tradition''.
The Rev Alan Sorensen, Househillwood, St Christopher's, Glasgow, moved
that the Panel on Worship be told to investigate replacing traditional
organ accompaniment by alternatives from current musical provision for
worship.
He said his congregation had bought a new organ but could not find an
organist.
They had solved the problem by buying a modern digital computerised
keyboard.
Doctor D M Campbell, of Penicuik, an elder, said music was a living
thing and needed live musicians. Worship would be diminished if the use
of pre-recorded music became common, he said.
Mr Sorensen's motion, also opposed by Mr Bell, was defeated.

RESOURCES for religious education in Roman Catholic schools in
Scotland are better than those in non-denominational schools, a Church
of Scotland minister claimed yesterday.
The Rev Andrew Mitchell, of Kilmarnock, said there was a lack of
knowledge among many young people about the Kirk.
He blamed this on a shortage of resources for religious education in
non-Catholic schools.
When acting as a schools chaplain, Mr Mitchell said he had to rely on
the good will of colleagues at Catholic schools for teaching aids such
as Scripture Union material and overhead projectors.
Mr Mitchell spoke as the Assembly backed moves to monitor the
implementation of Government guidelines on religious education and
observance in Scottish schools and welcomed a guide and video on the
teaching of the subject.
It was agreed that religious observance in schools across Scotland had
to be preserved and strengthened.
The Kirk's education convener, the Rev John Taylor, said
uncertainties, inconsistencies, and concern continued to surround the
area.
However, he told the Assembly the situation had already changed in the
last 25 years -- and pledged the battle would continue.

DISCUSSIONS over grading and jobs, between NHS officials and leaders
of the 36,000 midwives, were adjourned last night until June 7, but look
unlikely to have any direct impact on the main pay dispute involving
around 900,000 health workers.
That dispute -- over an offer of a 1% national rise, with up to 2%
available locally -- hinges on national negotiations offered earlier
this week by NHS human resources director, Mr Ken Jarrold, but still to
be arranged.
The offer was made after Unison, the largest of the unions involved,
postponed calling an industrial action ballot for six weeks.
Following yesterday's four hours of talks, Royal College of Midwives'
general secretary Julia Allison said she was more optimistic.
The college has suspended a ballot on industrial action but made it
clear that midwives would be balloted within 48 hours if the talks broke
down.

VAUXHALL is to change the name of its best-selling car from Cavalier
to Vectra when it is replaced in the autumn, it announced yesterday.
The switch has been made to bring the UK into line with the rest of
Europe where the popular Cavalier model -- first introduced in the UK in
1975 -- has always been known as a Vectra.
The company said the Vectra name ''had dynamic, positive
associations'' that best suited Vauxhall's marketing aspirations.
The Vectra will go on sale in the UK in saloon and hatchback versions,
with an estate model available later.
Vauxhall's sales and marketing executive director Ian Coomber promised
that the Vectra will be ''a radically new car'' ranging from 1.6 litre
to 2.5 litre models.
It will have a new chassis, hi-tech safety and security features, and
will consume up to 12% less fuel.
The change follows Vauxhall's desire to have uniform car names
throughout Europe -- a policy which led to the recent phasing out of the
Nova name in favour of the Corsa.
Last year, more than 100,000 new Cavaliers were sold in the UK,
putting the car into fourth place in the top sellers list. With
motorists waiting for the replacement model, the Cavalier has slipped
marginally behind the Vauxhall Astra in sales terms so far this year.
Around 1,750,000 Cavaliers have been sold.

HE looks like Holman Hunt's portrait of Jesus. Clear blue eyes, long
hair, and a soft voice. He has, according to a Gaelic-speaking
commissioner yesterday, a deep appreciation of the spirituality of the
Gael, the ability to charm the birds from the trees, and a street-wise
wit coupled with keen intelligence.
He is a member of the Iona Community and convener of the Panel on
Worship. He has gone from wild young man to establishment figure, from
hippy to hymn-writer, without any stage in between.
If you haven't guessed by now, he is the Rev John Bell, who stepped
down yesterday as convener of the Kirk's Panel on Worship. He goes back,
not like most retiring conveners to parish duties, but to his status as
a freelance musician provocateur. His interventions in this Assembly
have been intelligent and witty and gained him stature which it would be
a pity were not to be used further in the service of the Kirk.
However, John Bell has a fault -- identified by the Rev Alan Sorensen
yesterday. He is a Luddite when it comes to microchip technology. Mr
Sorensen's plea for the panel to invoke computer disks for keyboards
which could replace organists in parishes which could not find one, fell
on deaf ears. Ministers sometimes complain about difficult organists but
few were willing to vote them into oblivion.
I hope the Assembly will not be as traditionally minded when the
report of the Board of Communication is presented today. One section
commends the potential of the information super-highway but does not
specify action. The board, beleaguered by financial problems, has
reduced its number to ''twelve apostles'' and the Assembly will today be
asked to continue the slimmed down system.
However, the board could not tell me yesterday the names of those in
whose hands their future lies. Following Assembly approval for the
apostle-sized system, that secret will then be revealed by the
nomination committee. Considering the problems of this board in recent
years and the specialised nature of much of its work, the apostles will
hopefully not be amateurs or they may soon find themselves martyrs.
The Assembly is now midway through and I tried to find out from the
new computers who was leading in the Most Frequent Speaker Award (aka
Bore of the Assembly). It is apparently not programmed for this, but I
am. My selection lacks the objectivity of a machine but way out in front
in my view is the Rev Iain Whyte, chaplain at Edinburgh University, who
scarcely needs a seat he is so often on his feet.
Highlight of yesterday's several interventions was a politically
correct plea for discrimination on sexual orientation to be outlawed in
Kirk offices. Closing fast as a nominee is Charlie Webster, an elder
from Broughty Ferry, clutching his Bible (King James version of course).
The St Andrews University chaplain is not far behind, as are previous
winners, the Rev Alan Cartwright (the Talking Pullover, specialist in
points of order from the gallery) and the Clackety Clerk of Falkirk, the
Rev Duncan McClements, who is convener of Ecumenical Affairs and will
deal with the unity talks with Episcopalians approved this week.
Those who fear bishops are imminent may take heart that this is
unlikely.
Each commissioner is issued with a book of tickets for card voting
(strangely rather like raffle tickets). My suggestion is that speaking
tickets be issued also, to a maximum of 12. There were only 12 apostles
-- why should anyone need more than a dozen speeches?
Yesterday was ministry day. There was the usual parade of hair shirts
(those who want solidarity with the poor by cutting ministers' pay --
usually those who can afford the luxury of such views with two incomes)
but as evening closed the Assembly dealt for the first time in the
Kirk's history with a code of professional conduct for ministers.
After objections, that if approved, these would gain a quasi-legal
status which would confuse discipline matters, they were sent back to be
framed in legal form before being given the status of law.

AN impassioned plea by a young minister to set an example to people
less well off by freezing the service supplement paid to ministers was
rejected by the Assembly.
The Rev Martin Johnstone, of Bellshill, wanted the supplement to be
maintained at its present level of #833 and not increased in future.
This is its first year of payment.
Mr Johnstone said the ministers' stipend was not a king's ransom but
it was on a par with stipends in other denominations.
He said: ''Where I live, the comparison is not with other ministers
but with those who are on unemployment benefit and income support.
''There, I am not poor or badly paid. I am rich beyond the wildest
dreams of many.
''I have a security of employment and accommodation which others can
only dream of in the harsh reality of the nineties.''
The Very Rev Dr Hugh Wyllie, former Moderator, in a strong reply, said
many ministers had no income beyond what the Church paid them.
He knew of ministers in the Kirk who were having to draw state benefit
where they had a family of two or three and were having to live in a
home beyond their means that would not be theirs in future.
Mr Iain McCarter of Dalkeith, an elder, who had retired with ''an
excellent pension'' from a local authority, said Church of Scotland
ministers were grossly underpaid.
The Assembly agreed to set up a working party to look at all possible
means of supporting stipends.

LOTHIAN Regional Council has been admonished by a sheriff after
chlorinated water killed 900 fish in a burn.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that a valve opened when it should have
closed, causing the pollution which poisoned the fish.
In November, the council admitted allowing the polluting matter to get
into Bonaly Burn from Torduff Filter Station on May 12, 1994.
Depute-fiscal Brian Robertson said a wrongly-fitted valve opened when
it was turned in the direction of an arrow marked ''close''.
In all, 900 fish, up to 1.8km downstream, were killed.
Sentence was deferred until yesterday to allow the council to restock
the burn with fish and to take steps to make sure the same thing could
not happen again.
Sheriff Hazel Aronson QC was told Forth River Purification Board had
confirmed that both matters had been dealt with to its satisfaction.
The council's solicitor said it had been important to find out exactly
what happened.
The solicitor added that it was ironic that Lothian region had been
prosecuted as it was an organisation with an environmental charter and
which cared about the environment.

GOVERNMENT Ministers were warned yesterday that they could be
committing political suicide if they did not step up financial aid to
rural Scotland.
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council leaders claimed that recent
awards of #24m through the Scottish Office urban programme discriminated
against projects in rural areas.
They are challenging the Government to set up a rural aid fund to
redress the balance.
Councillor John Dowson, who chairs the region's economic development
committee, said that without such a move rural communities would neither
forgive nor forget the party which failed to take action on their
behalf.
He said the failure of so many of the bids put in for urban aid
funding in 1995-96 was ''bitterly disappointing''.
Dumfries and Galloway had submitted 10 bids but received approval for
only three.
Councillor Dowson said the council has struggled long and hard to
establish that urban aid money could be channelled to help Dumfries and
Galloway.
He challenged Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and Ministers Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton and Sir Hector Monro to set up a rural aid fund as part
of a current review of rural policy.
Councillor Dowson added: ''A rural fund is not a new idea. We have had
it rejected more than once in the past by this Government.''
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Office said competition for urban
programme support was particularly fierce this year.
In considering which projects to fund, account was taken of the
priority given to them by the sponsoring council, she said.

<HEADLINE>Lord Mackay rebukes lawyers over legal aid</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978239689</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Lord Chancellor launched a hard-hitting attack on lawyers
yesterday for opposing his plans to reform the legal-aid system.
He said the present system allowed solicitors to take on legal aid
work even if the service they offered was ''shoddy or at best
mediocre''.
He also accused the legal profession, which greeted his reform plans
last week with a chorus of disapproval, of seeking to maintain their
current ''straitjacket'' on the system.
Lord Mackay of Clashfern delivered his rebuke to representatives of
the profession at a London conference on the future of legal aid
organised by the Legal Action Group.
Under his reforms, funding would be provided for a wider range of
services such as mediation and advice from non-lawyers -- free from the
''straitjacket which forces people to use only those services which
lawyers currently supply''.
He said: ''My proposals would allow the system to break out of the
confines of that professional monopoly. To criticise such a system as
slicing into choice only makes sense if you examine it from the narrow
perspective of the solicitor's office.''
Lord Mackay went on to dismiss claims that proposed fixed budgets
would risk legal aid cash running out before the end of a year as a
''fantasy conjured up by a failure to understand how utterly changed the
new world would be''.
He said: ''I want no-one to be in doubt that these proposals are not
about cutting expenditure. They are about delivering more and delivering
better services.''
However, his assurances failed to satisfy Lady Wilcox, chairman of the
National Consumer Council.
She told the conference: ''We accept that the public purse cannot fund
unlimited demands that stretch indefinitely into the future. But neither
does it make sense to impose cash limits without knowing more about the
size of the problem.''
Mr Henry Hodge, deputy vice-president of the Law Society, was also
critical of proposals for spending limits, claiming: ''What the Lord
Chancellor means is not really targeting but rationing, setting those
with medical negligence cases against those with housing disrepair in
competition for funding.''
Bar Council chairman, Mr Peter Goldsmith, QC, put forward plans to
make Citizens' Advice Bureaux and other advice agencies a central
feature of the new legal-aid system.
He said: ''A national network of community-based advice agencies,
backed up by access to expert lawyers where necessary, would deliver an
efficient and cost-effective means of providing real help with the
resolution of legal problems and disputes.''
Mr Goldsmith suggested the Bar, which represents barristers, could
offer expert advice for a ''moderate fee'' direct to these centres so
they would not have to go through solicitors.
The #1200m legal-aid bill, which has increased five-fold in 10 years,
has attracted widespread criticism, with opponents claiming it is out of
control and widely abused.

THE man at the centre of a split among the membership of the Free
Church of Scotland yesterday refused to be drawn into a debate on a
controversy which could decide his career.
Professor Donald Macleod, who is under police investigation over an
unspecified complaint, said: ''I haven't got the foggiest idea what the
report to the police is.''
The Church's newly-elected Moderator faced a barrage of questions
about the affair.
At the close of yesterday morning's session of the General Assembly of
the Free Church in Edinburgh, the Rev Murdo Alex Macleod, minister at
Stornoway, said: ''I have every confidence in the functioning of the
General Assembly that it will come to a decision which is acceptable to
the Church, based on justice.''
The General Assembly is tomorrow due to consider a report from the
Training for Ministry Committee which last October dismissed allegations
against Professor Macleod who has held the chair of systematic theology
at the Free Church College in Edinburgh since 1978.
The committee has cleared the professor three times in nine years. His
supporters claim the revival of the allegations is due to a group of
people at odds with his views.
Tomorrow's debate will be held in private and Professor Macleod will
be entitled to address the assembly.
Two thousand ''adherents'' of the Church have signed a petition in
support of the professor.
Asked if his colleague had enemies, the Moderator said: ''I would say
so. He would not be a human being if he did not have enemies.''
He said he could not comment on any allegations. ''All I can say is
that any allegations made against anybody must be sustantiated in law.
You can't act against a person on the basis of suspicion.''
Mr Michael Bell, assistant procurator-fiscal in Edinburgh, said he was
aware that the police had been making inquiries.
The procurator-fiscal's office, he said, had not received any report:
''We anticipate receiving a report in the near future and it will be
considered in the normal way.''
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders police said a report was being
submitted to the fiscal.
Professor Macleod is held in a different light by two sections of the
Free Kirk. Some believe he is in conflict with the modern traditions of
the church while others regard him as one of the finest minds in any
church today.
His supporters believe Professor Macleod is being brought low by a
whispering campaign, orchestrated by those suspicious of his outlook and
jealous of the respect he has won.
Speculation as to the nature of his alleged sins has been rife within
Presbyterian circles, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.
However, there have also been gestures of support.
Whether or not this will be Professor Macleod's final assembly,
comparisons are already being drawn with the Synod of Free Presbyterian
Church in Inverness six years ago when the Lord Chancellor was suspended
for attending a requiem mass.
If Professor Macleod leaves the church, as he has already indicated he
might, he will take people with him.
The professor has established himself as one of Scotland's foremost
radical clerics. Born in Laxdale on Lewis in 1940, the son of the local
joiner, he studied at Glasgow University before going on to the Free
Church College.
His first charge was Kilmallie in Lochaber, followed by 10 years in
Partick Free Church, Glasgow. He then took over the chair of systematic
theology at the college.
While he was in Glasgow, his appointment as editor of the Free Church
Monthly Record brought him to the attention of more than the 20,000
adherents of the Free Church. His editorial column did not impress
everyone.
In 1988, for example, he wrote of a spate of prison riots:
''Christians cannot ignore the plight of the imprisoned or the condition
of our prisons. Calvary calls in question all systems of justice. It
reminds us that the prisoner is not always wrong and that the real
criminals are sometimes on the bench, not in the dock; in pinstripes not
in denims.''
Professor Macleod gave up the editorship but continued to speak out,
not least on Highland issues. He said: ''Adam was a crofter and only the
Fall gave us landlords.''
In March 1993, at the Scottish Crofters' Union annual conference in
Stornoway, he appeared on the same platform as one prominent land owner,
the Prince of Wales, and lectured him on the evils of landlordism,
demanding community ownership of land.
Last November, he appeared as an official witness at the public
inquiry into the proposed Harris superquarry and asked of the developers
and the authorities: ''Do you have God's mandate to inflict on the
creation a scar of this magnitude which detracts from creation's ability
to reflect the glory of God.''
Meanwhile, at the assembly itself, Moderator Macleod yesterday said
there had been an alarming deterioration morally and spiritually in the
life of the nation. He claimed the legislative measures of successive
Governments had catapulted society back to the brink of paganism,
singling out the National Lottery for particular criticism.

Michael Tumelty challenges the paymasters of Scottish Opera to declare
publicly that there is no hidden agenda which will spell the end of the
company inside this decade.
LET'S stop faffing about and have some plain speaking. If you are
going to see Scottish Opera perform this week, enjoy it -- because the
days of the company are numbered, and before the decade is out the
national company that Sir Alexander Gibson founded over 30 years ago
will probably no longer exist.
Alarmist? Yes: because it's time the full threat to the company was
exposed. It's time to state explicity that there is an agenda that will,
if pursued to its extreme, effectively see off Scottish Opera lock,
stock, and barrel. And if saying this inspires the profession's
political and financial masters to leap into print with statements of
refutation or commitment, then good; because that will be the clearest
thing they have said for years.
For starters, the statement issued by the Scottish Arts Council last
week is disingenuous. It declared that Scottish Opera, together with the
Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra,
had ''come together, with the support and involvement of the SAC'' to
form a working group to ''investigate ways in which the three
organisations could collaborate''.
Chairman of the arts council, Dr William Brown, said the move relates
specifically to recent collaborations between the Scottish orchestras.
No, it does not, and he shouldn't have said so. It doesn't relate at
all. The collaborations he referred to between the orchestras were
internal artistic decisions by the orchestras concerned.
They did not come about because the orchestras had been summoned by
the Scottish Arts Council. Nor, when the orchestras sat down to discuss
collaboration, did they have the arts council at the table. Nor -- most
significantly, and unlike the working group of the new, so-called
collaboration -- did they have an independent chairman, Sir Lewis
Robertson, who just happens to be a rather renowned company doctor.
This story has nothing to do with collaboration -- that is a red
herring. It has everything to do with cutting. The target is Scottish
Opera, and the arts council is not hanging about: the first meeting of
the working group takes place this week.
The superficial gloss is this: that the alleged underuse of the
orchestra of Scottish Opera -- working at only 50% capacity, being paid
100% -- remains unsolved. The proposed merger between the opera
orchestra and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra is dead in the water.
(And it really is time Scottish Opera's general director Richard Jarman
stopped reiterating the merger as his preferred option -- it is a failed
mantra.) The Scottish Arts Council, far from being the ''honest broker''
it called itself in that one, was in it up to the hilt.
Now the arts council is having another go. But this time it has
dragged in the RSNO and the SCO, its two principal revenue clients apart
from Scottish Opera, and is forcing them to come to the table. The
conventional interpretation, in recent days, sees the two symphony
orchestras sitting in the wings and, when the 54-strong opera orchestra
is finally disposed of, moving in, mopping up, and sharing the work of
an opera orchestra. Reluctant vultures, to judge from their mood.
Too easy; doesn't work like that. There are far too many occasions in
the season when neither orchestra would be free to do that; which is why
a full-time Scottish Opera orchestra was formed in the first place.
So what would happen when the orchestra of Scottish Opera is finally
disbanded? And make no bones about it, that is the immediate target of
the Scottish Arts Council. But only the first one. In recent years,
opera boss Richard Jarman, forced by the Scottish Office to balance the
books, has pruned drastically.
The company has put on fewer productions, which means less use of the
orchestra. That trend continues: Scottish Opera's new season, announced
less than a fortnight ago, contains only seven productions: not, in
anyone's terms, a lot of opera for #4.5m a year.
At the same time, Mr Jarman has gone on and on about the underuse of
the orchestra, to the extent that it has become a received apparent
truth on the music scene. He's not the villain here, but in these senses
he has helped to dig the grave for a company that does less and less,
needs more and more money for it, and to boot has an orchestral resource
that spends half of its paid time not playing.
Suddenly, last week, following the arts council announcement, Richard
Jarman did a complete volte-face and said to me that he would be
''arguing for the retention of a full-time, in-house opera orchestra and
chorus''. (Funny: I hadn't asked him about the chorus.)
So, take away the opera orchestra and chorus, and what do you have?
Apart from a couple of young contract singers, you have Scottish Opera
as a vast army of vans, furniture, premises, electrical and stage
technicians, wardrobe people, planners, administrators, and marketing
staff. Do you think the SAC will pay four and half million for that? The
company couldn't survive. No opera company: endgame.
So what would Scotland do about opera provision? Here again, Scottish
Opera might have dug its own grave. It's well known that major national
British companies -- Welsh National Opera, Opera North, Glyndebourne,
and others -- haven't been able to set foot in Scotland because Scottish
Opera has exercised territorial rights and literally prevented them from
getting over the Border. The Edinburgh Festival Theatre, desperate to
book the touring companies, is livid.
So don't kid me on that the demise of Scottish Opera is a ridiculous
concept because it would mean no opera in Scotland. We'd be invaded; and
it would be very convenient to the arts council, because it need not
even involve any transfer of the defunct Scottish Opera's funds.
The most optimistic alternative scenario would see Scottish Opera
reduced to a part-time company with ad hoc support from the RSNO and SCO
-- who, presumably under instruction from the arts council, would have
to amend their own schedules accordingly. Too messy, logistically.
The orchestra bosses are putting a brave(ish) face on it at the
moment. Roy McEwan, managing director of the SCO, did say: ''The most
honest answer I can give is that if we are talking collaborations, the
question of orchestral provision is going to come up; whether it becomes
an issue depends on what Scottish Opera's agenda is.''
Paul Hughes, chief executive of the RSNO, agreed, though he sounded
unusually depressed, saying: ''We'll go in and see what comes out,''
while implying that yet another report was perhaps the last thing they
all needed.
Matthew Rooke, music director of the Scottish Arts Council, said the
working group was ''a sensible and mature way of mapping out a
financially difficult road ahead''. Asked if there were implications for
the future of the Scottish Opera orchestra, he said: ''I wouldn't say so
at this stage.'' He also said the working group was something being
''driven from within the organisations themselves'', which is the exact
opposite of what they're all saying.
I reckon the arts council's agenda is to go for broke. Their policy is
one of maximum intervention. Forget their catch phrases of
''enablement'' and ''empowerment''. This is the council that closes
companies by removing grants.
The old autocratic warlords of the music companies are gone now. I
don't really suppose there's a chance of the RSNO's chief executive,
Paul Hughes, and the SCO's Roy McEwan calling their own press conference
to state publicly that, whatever is going on, it has nothing to do with
the orchestras -- who will be tainted by all this.
And I don't suppose there's the remotest chance of Richard Jarman and
his music director Richard Armstrong doing the same, and clearly stating
the threat that they must perceive (and that every musician in Scotland
is talking about).
I will say this. Before Sir Lewis Robertson cross-examines orchestral
and opera managements and begins to wield his knife, may I remind him
that in his most famous statement -- in assessing the ills of industry
and companies at large -- he said that the fault, in every case he had
come across, lay at the door of management. There is only one management
in this crisis. And it is the Scottish Arts Council. Go on, prove me
wrong.

FESTIVAL director Mike Hart will be praying for the sunshine which
dazzled the Edinburgh International Jazz Festival official launch to
return on the event's opening weekend, particularly Sunday, August 6.
That afternoon, in the now tentless Princes Street gardens, Jazz on a
Summer's Day gives many of the bands appearing elsewhere in the festival
a chance to put themselves in the shop window and attract people back to
their own shows later in the week.
Then, in the evening, Van Morrison appears with the BBC Radio Big Band
in the Festival Theatre. Though not strictly speaking a jazz performer,
Morrison's singing style does include improvisation, and this far from
business-as-usual setting should produce the hoped-for full house.
Less tenuously linked to jazz, and one of the attractions that leaps
out of the programme, is the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, who will be
appearing alongside Bob Wilber's original Soprano Summit and many others
at the gala concert in the Festival Theatre (August 9) and during the
busy Cotton Club series at the Cavendish in Tollcross (August 6-10).
The Dirty Dozen single-handedly revived the New Orleans brass band
tradition, adding a shot of rhythm and blues and a dash of gospel, and
to say that their performances are exuberant is something of an
understatement. More gospel music comes from the Five Blind Boys of
Alabama, who appear in St Giles' Cathedral (August 11), where the
marvellous pianist Dick Hyman and Ben Saunders give a jazz organ recital
alongside gospel singer Topsy Chapman (August 7).
The Queen's Hall is the setting for the Opening Party (August 5), the
return of Rosemary Squires, Barbara Jay, and Maxine Daniels singing the
Ella Fitzgerald Song Book II (August 7), George Melly (August 8), and
the double bill of guitarist Martin Taylor's Spirit of Django and singer
Claire Martin (August 10).
The ever popular -- and free -- McEwan's Pub Trail once again offers a
five day (August 7-11) crawl round eight Old Town hostelries, and the
Tron Jazz Cellar will host a programme of top Scottish contemporary jazz
(August 5-11). The Blues Festival moves to the Cavendish for two days
and nights (August 12 and 13) of continuous blues on two stages, with
former Muddy Waters guitarist Jimmy Rogers headlining a modest line-up.
Meanwhile, Dundee Jazz &amp; Blues Festival will celebrate its 13th year
after all. Following the local committee's demise, Edinburgh-based jazz
promoters Assembly Direct have stepped in to present four concerts at
Dundee Rep: The Tommy Smith Quartet (June 7); Suzanne Bonnar (June 8);
Tam White (June 9), and Courtney Pine (June 10). A Blues Bonanza
featuring eight Scottish bands in six pubs replaces the popular Jazz
Village on Saturday, June 24.

CHRONIC traffic congestion and poor air quality are the two problems
most likely to harm Edinburgh's appeal as a business and tourist centre,
it was claimed yesterday.
The claim is made in a review carried out last year by management
consultants Touche Ross and commissioned by Edinburgh District Council,
Lothian Regional Council, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (Leel),
and Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce.
Separate surveys of residents, businesses, visitors, councillors, and
schoolchildren, found that they felt Edinburgh compared favourably with
other cities because of its history, good access to the countryside, and
its clean streets and drinking water.
However, the review found: ''There was also a broad measure of
agreement with respect to Edinburgh's environmental weakness.
''Two of the major weaknesses to emerge were traffic congestion and
poor air quality. The city was also generally regarded as not 'green' in
terms of its overall environment performance.''
Though Edinburgh ranked reasonably well with other British cities, the
report found, it was ranked only eighth in a list of 15 European cities.
In waste management, it was placed well behind Copenhagen, generating
large amounts of waste and disposing of virtually all of it to landfill.
''Similarly, Edinburgh lags behind the leading European cities in
terms of the imagination and effectiveness with which it is addressing
the problem of traffic congestion,'' it stated.
Although the consultants acknowledge that new strategies are emerging
each year, they say Edinburgh could follow the lead of Bologna, which
had introduced free public transport during rush hours (funded by a levy
on employers) and park-and-ride facilities and had pedestrianised its
streets and piazzas.
It urges Edinburgh to follow the best international practice in a
range of other areas, including heritage protection and energy and open
space management.
It also suggests the city adopts ''a clear and practical vision''
which takes into account environmental concerns and aims to improve the
quality of life in general.
Areas of neglect highlighted in the report include the coastline
around the city and its parks and open spaces. It warns of potentially
dire consequences if the Scottish capital does not tackle these issues.
''Edinburgh's natural environment has historically been one of the
city's key strengths, attracting businesses and visitors who have
underpinned its prosperity.
''If nothing is done to correct areas of weakness, Edinburgh risks
slipping down the UK league table as well. This represents a potential
threat to the continued prosperity of the city.''
The review also calls for the establishment of an environmental forum
to bring together all interested groups and co-ordinate a common
strategy.
Addressing a conference in Edinburgh to promote such a strategy,
Councillor Keith Geddes, Labour leader on Lothian Regional Council, said
the review provided a good starting point.
Councillor Geddes said: ''I would hope that by the year 2000 we will
not still be talking about integrated transport systems and recycling
25% of the domestic waste within the city but that we will actually be
coming forward with working plans to implement these targets''.

LESLEY STEVENSON visits a London exhibition exploring the relationship
between art, money, and gambling.
GAMBLING is now more popular in Britain than in any other country in
Europe: the nation spends #60m per week on the National Lottery. As the
art world waits to see how the income from the lottery will be carved
up, the exhibition floor of the Barbican Art Gallery was transformed
over the weekend into a huge betting arena, making explicit the
connections between art, money, and gambling.
The chances of success in the art market are increasingly risky and
the show, Art Casino, cleverly managed to expose this by comparisons to
the fake glitziness of the gambling world and the way it has been
glamorised by the use of new media.
The interactive nature of many of these specially commissioned works
made them hard to resist. Several of the artists were present, dressed
as croupiers, and we were all invited to have a flutter.
Curated by performance artist Annie Griffin, the event was an assault
on all the senses. A lush Las Vegas soundtrack accompanied the punters
as we toured the various attractions, and the evocative smell of turf at
the end of a long day at the racecourse was everywhere (the gallery had
been carpeted with grass).
The video installation, My Mind is Racing, by the actress Tilda
Swinton and John Maybury, recorded their trip to Newbury races to spend
#1000 from the Arts Council on the horses. A fax from Ronnie, a
professional punter, laid out a set of golden rules for gambling,
including only ever spending 2% of one's bank roll and not betting
without a strong opinion.
The film-maker, Peter E Richardson, and Mark Wallinger, collaborated
on A Real Work of Art, which follows the fortunes of Wallinger's
unsuccessful racehorse. Swinton made no money and Wallinger's horse was
injured and managed only one race in the season; but resulting works
managed to capture the moment of hope before the inevitable
disappointment.
Laura Ford had replaced the reels of dayglow fruit in her Fruit
Machines with poignant phrases about the perilous nature of selling
work: ''Sold to a friend'', ''Sold to the Arts Council'', and ''Sold to
an important collector'', and had given them hypnotic sound effects.
Sher Rajah's It's a Big If involved an infra-red sensing device which
activated two ball machines to fire foam rubber balls at the punter.
Perhaps the most powerful works of all were Hugo Glendinning's
photographs, including Select -- a series of life-size photographs of
greyhounds -- or Reveal, a set of large photographs of people taken on a
three-mile walk along a high street in East London.
Above the photographs, a large coloured dot distinguished between
those who had played the lottery and won, those who had never played,
and those who had played and lost. Not surprisingly this last group was
the largest.
This clever and ambitious show managed to expose some of the
seductions of gambling. A small plaque with the Gamblers' Anonymous
telephone number was tucked discreetly into a corner.

BOSSES yesterday accused a union of intimidation by boarding works
buses in a bid to get workers to join up.
However, the general workers' union, the GMB, described its boarding
party as a ''bold initiative''.
Union organisers boarded the 6am buses which take workers to the
Mimtec Electronics factory in Gourock. The plant is non-unionised and
there have been complaints about poor wages and working conditions for
the 500 workers.
GMB organiser Duncan McNeil said that for 18 months, Mimtec -- part of
Rangers owner David Murray's industrial empire -- had refused workers
the right to even choose whether they wanted to be represented by a
union.
As management had also refused the union permission to even speak to
staff, the GMB decided on the unusual step of boarding the buses.
Mr McNeil said given the management's heavy anti-union and bullying
attitudes, they got a great reception.
''We received a tremendous response,'' he said. ''Eighty courageous
workers have already joined the GMB and more signed up today.
''It's the clearest message to Mimtec's chairman David Murray and
managing director Gordon McKie that they must do the right and
democratic thing -- allow their workforce the right to choose.''
A management spokesman claimed, however, that union efforts so far had
met with limited success.

THERE must be something wrong when, in a concert that opens with
Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks and a potent example of Haydn storm and
stress, it is Vivaldi's The Four Seasons that receives the most
arresting performance.
But that was how it was when America's celebrated conductorless
chamber orchestra visited Edinburgh last night, with Gil Shaham as the
smooth, alert, bright-toned soloist in Vivaldi's four violin concertos.
The playing was a model of fleet, keenly profiled responsiveness,
alive to every phrase, rhythm, change of speed, and picturesque detail.
To Hans Keller's famous statement that Vivaldi had written background
music with nothing in the foreground, it was a performance that replied
''So what?''
If this was background music, then a foreground was irrelevant. The
music was like a box of brilliant Italian tricks, none of which failed
in its effect.
Though the product presumably of long and scrupulous rehearsal, with
the continuo player switching between harpsichord and chamber organ in
the course of a single concerto, it sounded zestfully spontaneous,
lavish in its dynamic range, and seductive in its interplay between
soloist and first cello.
Haydn's 52nd symphony, on the other hand, sounded curiously
characterless and Stravinsky's witty concerto simply grumpy. Viva
Vivaldi!

A celebration of a soft shade of many hues: Anne Simpson signals the
return of an uninhibited style from which no woman of imagination should
shrink.
WHEN Elsa Schiaparelli inflamed the eye with her preposterous pink she
liberated women from the unremarkable niceness of timid taste. And once
freed they became almost intoxicated by colour, the more reckless among
them demanding shocking pink wigs and shocking pink boudoirs, shocking
pink stockings, and the concocted decadence of shocking pink vodka.
Suddenly from the black and whiteness of the thirties the whole social
whirl of fashionable living seemed to shimmer and throb like a vast,
exploding peony.
Ever restless Madame Schiaperelli herself moved on to even more
startling effects, teaming up with Salvador Dali to create tiny hats
shaped like lamb cutlets, only now she used pink instead of white for
the traditional paper frills cuffing the bone.
In between such mad capers she was also experimenting with outrageous
textiles which she composed from Cellophane, straw and glass. More
lastingly Schiaparelli introduced the padded shoulder, the large bow
worn on a jumpered breast, and the wayward notion of mountainous tweeds
for town.
But her most valuable contributions were her beliefs that no woman
should shrink from exploiting colour, and her uninhibited insistence
that style must be fun. Now, more than half a century later, her lively
ghost hovers over many a collection where pink is celebrated in all its
variations, adding blush to garments ranging from indispensable,
slightly wasted linen jackets to delicate chemises.
And along the way it transforms the canvas chukka boot into something
flirty steeped in raspberry sorbet. The downside to pink, however, has
been that certain tackiness associated with candlewick bedspreads,
Crimplene two-pieces and cheap nylon drapes.
Sticky rock, blancmange and dusty marshmallows haven't done the colour
any favours, either. But its latest rehabilitation began more engagingly
last year with Gianni Versace's bubblegum cire outfits which brought
back the look the bobbysoxer.
Since then a tide of pinky milkshakes has lapped over the work of many
designers. There are Paul Costelloe's pert, little suits in clover, lots
of candyfloss dress and jackets from Dolce and Gabbana, sugar almond
suede blazers by Christian Lacroix, and at Jean-Paul Gaultier, pink
scrubbing-brush haircuts.
But this just isn't the colour of the catwalk. Pink has flushed the
hottest high street names, Kookai, and Esprit going for sunset richness,
Jigsaw, and Hobbs using the palest of geranium for sexy twin sets while
Whistles, and Monsoon both have lots of silks and satins in softest
shell.
At The Gallery in Glasgow there is a wonderful fizzing pink in Lainey
Keogh's chenille knitwear, a watercolour pink used for a Prada suit, and
a dusty foxglove for separates by Jean Muir.
At Cruise in Glasgow's Princes Square, Moschino is remembered in a
series of baby pink shifts and trouser ensembles, and there you will
also find one of Ozbek's petal-soft dresses, plus Ferretti's elegant
little boucle suit in the tenderest of pinks featuring mother of pearl
buttons, or her mauvey tailored shirt in chiffon. And, as a footnote to
the pink story, Marks and Spencer have the dolly shoe, a pert little
pump in the colour of the palest carnation.
In fact, this season's pink comes in many guises: lilac, cerise,
pearl, lupin, and the rosiest of rose. But in each case the primary
purpose is to flatter without being over-sweet. A good pink against the
skin cajoles the mood and its elegant delicacy can make light of even
lousy weather, lifting some of the weight from a sullen sky.

THE Herald went to court yesterday to challenge the principle of a
judge's ban on the use of a picture of the wife of the Safeway poisoner,
Dr Paul Agutter.
Agutter, 48, was jailed for 12 years at the High Court in Edinburgh in
February this year for attempting to murder his wife, Alex, at their
East Lothian home by spiking her gin and tonic with the deadly poison
atropine.
A jury also found him guilty of trying to cover his tracks by placing
bottles contaminated with atropine on the shelves of the Safeway
supermarket at Hunter's Tryst, New Swanston, Edinburgh.
A number of customers became violently ill after drinking from the
bottles and the shelves had to be cleared during a nationwide safety
alert.
Agutter has now lodged an appeal against his conviction and sentence.
At the start of the trial, Lord Morison made a ruling that the media
could not publish pictures of an 11-year-old girl who originally
featured in the attempted murder charge.
He also banned the media from using pictures of Mrs Agutter, taking
the view that this would help protect the identity of the girl.
Yesterday, Caledonian Newspapers, publishers of The Herald, asked Lord
Justice General Hope, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and Clyde at the
Court of Criminal Appeal, to rescind the part of the order which banned
the use of a picture of Mrs Agutter.
Miss Leeona Dorrian QC, for The Herald, submitted that the terms of
the order made by Lord Morison went beyond the powers provided by the
1975 Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act.
The Act bans publication of details calculated to identify children
under the age of 16 involved in criminal proceedings.
She argued that although Lord Morison had talked of ''dispensing
with'' the provisions of the 1975 Act, by banning publication of
pictures of Mrs Agutter (although not the printing of her name or
relationship to the accused) he had imposed a wider restriction than
laid down by the legislation.
''In making an order prohibiting the publication of photographs of Mrs
Agutter, he was making an order that was not competent for him to
make.''
Miss Dorrian added: ''The Herald has no wish to publish photographs of
the 11-year-old girl or identify the girl, nor has it sought to do so.
The view that has been taken, however, is that prohibiting publication
of photographs of the wife of the accused is not warranted by the
statute and must be opposed as a matter of principle.''
There was a legitimate public interest in reporting court proceedings
and any restriction was an exception to the general rule.
Miss Lucy Keane, appearing for Agutter, opposed any lifting of the
ban. She argued that Lord Morison had been correct to make the order
which he did and that the terms of the order did not go beyond the
powers provided by the 1975 Act.
Mr Colin Boyd, Advocate-depute, felt it was in the interests of the
press that they should be clear about what they could and could not
publish and Lord Morison's order had left a feeling of uncertainty.
Lord Hope said the court would give a decision in writing later,
adding that it was important, particularly in view of the wider public
interest, that the terms of the ruling were carefully worded.

Scotland spoils visitors for choice in nominating their favourite
places for a Tourist Oscar Award, as LESLEY DUNCAN reports.
MAY'S in full swing. Daffodils have given way to bluebells and lilacs.
Sunshine, if not warmth, tempts travellers. This year's Tourist Oscar
Awards seek nominations from you, the public.
The Herald, in conjunction with the Scottish Tourist Board, Caithness
Glass, and Grampian Television, wants your help in choosing Scotland's
best town, best village, and best overall tourist attraction, as well as
winners of the new ''on the water'' and ''glorious garden'' categories.
There's the chance of a luxury break for two at the Turnberry Hotel,
Ayrshire, for anyone who nominates a winning entry.
An introductory article on the awards last month made some
suggestions, including the recently opened Duff House, Banff. This great
eighteenth-century mansion, designed by William Adam and lapped by winds
off the Moray Firth, has been given new life as an outstation of the
National Galleries of Scotland.
It displays Ramsays and Raeburns as well as an El Greco amid exquisite
period furnishings and decor. All sorts of educational initiatives also
tempt the public to enjoy its facilities. Mount Stuart, Bute, with its
mansion and 300 acres of landscaped grounds and woodlands, is also set
to charm the public when it opens next month.
Readers have already been offering ideas on possible award winners. In
the town category, Stirling so far vies with Perth -- two handsome towns
with much Scottish history. Stirling has, of course, the advantage of
Bannockburn, the Wallace Monument, and its castle brooding above the
town. Trees in new leaf on the castle's western escarpment and the
golden ranks of whin on the Gowan Hill to the east make it particularly
picturesque these days. Unfortunately, some of Stirling's central
streets have been undergoing prolonged upheaval in the course of being
pedestrianised.
Perth probably cherishes the Tay more than Stirling does the Forth. It
is a splendid backdrop to the town's annual festival, which starts next
week.
Inverness has its fans. Luss on Loch Lomondside, the royal village of
Ballater, Sorn in Ayrshire, Inveraray at the head of Loch Fyne,
Aviemore, Ceres and Anstruther in Fife, and last year's winner,
Plockton, are among the villages nominated.
Suggestions for the best tourist attraction include New Lanark, David
Dale's restored eighteenth-century industrial village near the Falls of
Clyde.
The Waverley is paddling ahead in the ''on the water'' category,
though Deep Sea World, in the shadow of the Forth Bridge and an
award-winner last year, is also a popular choice. Portpatrick,
Wigtownshire, with its scrambling start to the Southern Upland Way, and
Crovie village, east of Macduff, are other nominations for this
category.
Scotland's wealth of gardens is shown in the range of early
nominations: the great terraces at Culzean; the statue-dotted acres of
Drummond Castle Gardens, Crieff (featured in the film Rob Roy); the
Younger Botanic Gardens near Dunoon; the gardens at Crathes and
Inverewe.
There's still plenty of time for new thoughts, new nominations. The
Speyside town of Keith, for example, has just seen the opening of a #6m
''heritage project'' designed to boost sales of Scotch throughout the
world for the Canadian distilling company Seagrams.
Down in Ayrshire the salutary tale of a man who drank injudiciously --
''The Tam o' Shanter Experience'' -- is told at Alloway with all the
latest multimedia techniques. It can be followed with a visit to Burns'
Cottage and the real Brig o' Doon, where Tam's mare lost her tail. The
Queen will open what's officially dubbed the Burns National Heritage
Park on July 5, an event of particular significance on the run-up to the
poet's bicentenary in 1996.
''Experiences'' are the thing this year. The Perthshire Visitor Centre
at Bankfoot offers its Macbeth version, which promises to reveal the
complex reality behind the Shakespearian character -- and of course the
witches. There's lots specifically to amuse children at Loudoun Castle
Park, Ayrshire.
The Golf Museum in St Andrews, close to the Old Course, is bound to be
a hit with the thousands of enthusiasts drawn to the town for the Open
Championship in July. An attraction of a totally different sort was
opened in Fife last year. Scotland's Secret Bunker, on a quiet road
between Anstruther and St Andrews, was built in the early 1950s as a
command post for senior members of the Government and officials in the
event of nuclear war. From its disguised entrance in a farm cottage, an
underground world for survivors of nuclear holocaust can be explored.

THE founders of the London Marathon, Mr Chris Brasher and Mr John
Disley, yesterday collected six-figure sums in a #1.1m action against
Channel 4 TV and New Statesman magazine.
The payments, which will be covered by insurance, were claimed by a
spokesman for Mr Goodman Derrick, the plaintiff's solicitors, to be one
of the highest libel damages ever paid by a TV firm in the UK.
The magazine article, in 1990, and the TV Dispatches programme, the
following year, were researched and written by Scottish journalist
Duncan Campbell. They made serious and untrue allegations of fraud,
deception, and dishonesty, wrongly alleging that the two former athletes
had used the London Marathon to enrich themselves.
Mr Brasher, the 1956 Olympic steeplechase champion, is understood to
have received #230,000. Mr Disley, Olympic bronze medallist in 1952, and
a vice chairman of the Sports Council, accepted #150,000.
In addition, the race itself is believed to have received #10,000.
With costs awarded to the plaintiffs, the settlment is substantially in
excess of #1m, with solicitors the biggest beneficiaries.
An injunction against the original programme was applied for but was
refused because the TV company claimed it could justify everything
broadcast. The settlement acknowledged it was unable to do so.
In addition to broadcasting the programme, the TV company sent a
dossier to the Company Fraud Department of the Metropolitan Police,
Charity Commissisoners, Inland Revenue, and the Institute of Chartered
Accountants. Each conducted an inquiry but found no case to answer.
Indeed, the Revenue found a #15,000 tax overpayment.

A COUNCIL'S politically correct policies were yesterday blamed for
allowing care workers suspected of abusing children to escape detection.
An independent report said 32 staff working for Islington Council in
north London faced allegations of abuse, including involvement in
paedophile rings, child pornography, and child prostitution.
However, the council was so ''paralysed by equal opportunity and race
issues'' it prevented any proper investigation. Only two were dismissed.
The report said some of the staff were possibly still working in child
care with ''potentially serious consequences''.
Last night, an Islington Council spokeswoman said the council would be
writing to all of Scotland's regional authorities advising that they
check the records of social work staff.
A spokesman for Scotland's largest authority, Strathclyde Regional
Council, said it was not uncommon for authorities south of the Border to
issue such warnings.
He added that if one were received from Islington, checks would be
run.
However, he added that authorities had to be careful not to infringe
employees' civil rights.
The report follows an inquiry ordered by the Government in the wake of
newspaper allegations that some children in Islington's care were
gang-raped, worked as prostitutes, and took drugs.
It paints a picture of a council where ''poor practice and negligent
management action'' could flourish.
Islington yesterday suspended the head of a family centre in the wake
of the report, which follows 13 separate inquiries into standards of
care in the borough.
Although the Department of Health has issued guidance on checking such
groups, the report said there were worries there was not a ''consistent
approach nationally to this''.

The hair is expensively cut but casually worn. The charcoal Armani
suit over a beige blouse spells power lady. Douglas Thompson reports on
the metamorphosis of Meg Ryan.
SHE is Hollywood's best contender for Twenty-first-century Superwoman.
And now Meg Ryan is Central Casting for the role. Her uniform of
sun-bleached jeans, white tee-shirts, trademark round sunglasses, cowboy
boots, and crazy cropped blonde hair that matched her naughty, lopsided
grin, is now stashed irrevocably in her off-duty wardrobe.
This is Miss Capability Ryan. Until recently she was content simply to
sell her services to the movies -- her films have earned $750m at the
American box office alone -- but there's been some dramatic happenings.
She's now a working mother and having triumphed domestically -- much to
her surprise -- she wants more control of her professional life.
Her new, more mature attitude is visible at 11am in the penthouse
suite of a Beverly Hills hotel. Previously with Meg Ryan it was casual
wear, coffee, giggles, and throaty laughs. She was always serious about
her work and life but a remarkable metamorphosis is clear. Ironically,
by her reservation.
Her hands and arms don't jump around the place. Mostly she sits with
them clasped as she makes her points. The hair is expensively cut but
casually worn. The charcoal Armani suit over a beige Donna Karan blouse
spells power lady. As do the dark suede heels. She grins: ''When I wear
high heels I have a great vocabulary and I speak in paragraphs. I'm more
eloquent. I plan to wear them more often.''
Meg Ryan, who made her screen debut at age 15, a funky adolescent with
a wistful, faraway, safe smile, has grown up. But not, as many thought,
to become just another Doris Day, a fluff in a lithe, dancer's body, the
perennial (until the looks went) girl-next-door romantic star.
Nora Ephron, who wrote Ryan's breakthrough film When Harry Met Sally
(1989) and directed her landmark movie Sleepless in Seattle (1993),
believes she knows what has made Ryan a major power player today. And
it's not because she graduated with honours from the usual Hollywood
leading lady talon contest.
She is liked by both men and women on and off screen. It helps her box
office and her present production arrangements. Ephron said: ''She has
no vanity. The women that women love are women who don't walk around
full of their own self-love. You absolutely know when you see Meg on
screen that if you found yourself next to her you might become
friends.''
Ryan has certainly become dealer-friendly. Her latest film French
Kiss, in which she co-stars with Kevin Kline and Timothy Hutton, charged
into the American box office this month a commercial, if not totally
critical, success. She is a co-producer and on location in France would
''take'' script meetings with director Lawrence Kasdan.
''I was just trying to make it better than it already was. When I read
the script I thought: 'I can't believe they haven't made this yet. Isn't
it a movie everybody would want to see?' ''
Of course, that's a producer talking. She's selling her film which
involves her teaming up with Kline to hunt France for her runaway
husband-to-be Hutton. It's a tangled triangle but she uses it to make a
point: ''It's all about this confusion about roles. The difference
between what you're supposed to do and what you really feel like
doing.'' There is no confusion in her life.
She married actor Dennis Quaid on St Valentine's Day, 1991, but only
after he agreed to overcome his cocaine addiction. With her support and
help he did. Almost 14 months later, their son Jack Henry was born. And
a year later she created her own company, Prufrock Pictures, named after
one of her favourite poems, T S Eliot's The Love Song of J Alfred
Prufrock.
''Meg's dedication to the company is very pragmatic,'' said her
business partner Kathryn Galan, adding: ''It has to do with her wanting
to control her destiny. She hears her instincts clearly about what does
and doesn't work.''
The busy hyphenate -- like Jodie Foster her future is all wrapped
around being an actress-producer-director -- explains: ''Becoming a
mother helped give me the confidence to move into other areas. I felt so
capable as a mother which is something I never thought I would be. And
that invaded other parts of my life. I felt like: Listen I can do this.
''Why shouldn't I be able to do that thing -- and how come people are
underestimating that part of me? She applies much pressure on herself
and, apart from Sleepless in Seattle, which she says she was ''forced''
to see, she has avoided her other films. ''I always think I could have
done things better or won't like how I look.''
The vanity, of course, is professional. She is well aware that a
''look'' matters before and behind the cameras. And this has helped her
turn out films like a popcorn machine. French Kiss is one of a
rapid-fire trio. Another was IQ which had her choosing her partner
between good 'ol boy Tim Robbins and smart, toffee-nosed Stephen Fry and
you don't have to be Einstein (as co-star Walter Matthau was) to know
who won. Restoration, a $14m production made in Britain last year, found
her co-starring with Robert Downey Jr. In the film, which will be
released in September this year, she's a mentally unstable woman
involved with Downey's doctor at the court of Charles II.
She's hoping to play another troubled woman, the poet Sylvia Plath, in
a film biography produced by Prufrock. Her company has a string of other
projects in development including Antonia and Jane which charts the
friendship of two women and Best Friends which is about what the title
says.
Whether Meg Ryan appears in all films, directs them, or just produces,
she will be The Boss. And that is the reason she is playing -- and
dressing -- by the mogul method and leaving Brando types to the white
T-shirts.
More and more women are wearing the Power Pants. Meg Ryan's fit very
well. Although she still has diffiulty understanding Hollywood: ''I've
been in this business for years and I'm still befuddled by the ways of
this town. Sometimes a studio will send me a script and say would I like
to produce with them. Or would I like to be ''attached'' to the project.
Or can they ''sneak'' me a script. I know as soon as I put down the
phone they'll be trying to ''sneak'' it to someone else. I like to
understand the logical progression of things but this business is just
too convoluted.''
So is the situation with her mother, Susan, who got the daughter she
calls ''Peggy'' her first role in 1981's Rich and Famous in which she
played Candice Bergen's daughter. Soon after her mother left the family
home in Connecticut she remarried a journalist called Pat Jordan, who
wrote attacking articles about the family relationship. American tabloid
television took up the emotional tale of a Family at War.
Meg Ryan has stayed silent. She acknowledged the family estrangement
in an American magazine this month but only to say: ''I'm just really
happy to be away from them. It's the only peaceful way for me to be. I
just want to make clear it has nothing to do with something that
happened when I was 15. I'm over it. It's a long-running personality,
character thing.''
Quaid calls his wife ''positive'' but quickly qualifies: ''She doesn't
come from a shallow place. She's vibrant and positive in spite of having
gone through a lot of hard things in life.''
Ryan, Quaid, and Jack live in a 1917-built bungalow in Santa Monica,
California, or on their 200-acre Montana ranch. Her life revolves around
the men and places in her life. And, of course, Prufrock.
''My family responsibilities don't conflict with my career. Not at
all. I'm not tired. I like the fact that, finally, I have a home where I
can stay for a long time. And I like that Jack has a routine, which I
never had, and now because I have one -- because of him -- I realise I
thrive on it.''
As she does in her marriage with Quaid. They met making the film
Innerspace in 1987 (they also teamed in DOA in 1988 and Flesh and Bone
last year). For a long time Quaid was the bigger star.
''Dennis and I have a theory about success. It comes in waves. It's
easy to be in a marriage with someone who does what you do if you
respect him a great deal, and Dennis is an amazing actor. I don't think
it will ever be a problem for us. Acting is what I do. It's not what I
solely define myself as. It's not something to die for. I like my job. I
love my son.
''After Jack was born I'd think about how when I was younger I used to
wonder if I was living life the way I should be. I used to worry that I
was off on the wrong tangent, that the road I should be on was over
there.
''Now I look at myself, at my life, my marriage, our child, and I say
with some disbelief: 'You are doing OK'.''

Washington, Tuesday
THE ruins of the Alfred Murrah federal office building in Oklahoma
collapsed to the ground at 7am today as a series of explosions brought
down each part of it. The demolition lasted barely eight seconds.
Survivors of the terrorist attack, and hundreds of relatives and
friends of those who were killed, gathered around the site to watch and
weep.
A siren gave a two-minute warning of the event. There was a string of
muffled booms, and first the side walls, then the back, and finally the
stairwell and lift-shafts shuddered and subsided.
It was quite unlike the explosion of April 19, which involved over two
tons of fertiliser explosive in a parked truck in front of the building.
The shock ripped out its centre and wrecked buildings three or four
blocks away, and blew out windows up to three miles from the site.
This time, only 100lb of dynamite was used. All that remains now is a
huge pile of rubble, and the bulldozers moved in immediately to clear it
all away.
The authorities know that the bodies of two women, who worked in a
bank, are still buried beneath the rubble.
They said yesterday that a third body may also be there, of a
54-year-old man who may have been in the bank and who has not been seen
since April 19.
Before the explosives were set off, the area of the rubble where the
two women are thought to be buried was covered with plastic sheeting, to
guide workmen when they reach it.
The friends and relatives who watched today's blastleft quickly when
it was over. Others chose not to watch, saying they just want to forget.
''I've seen the damage. I've felt the damage and I have no need to see
it again,'' said Bill Day, whose 38-year-old sister, Diana Day, died in
the bombing.
Meanwhile, police in Detroit, Michigan, freed James Nichols, who
prosecutors say had a role in the attack but whose lawyer said the
government had failed to produce evidence to prove a connection.
He is the brother of Terry Nichols, who with Timothy McVeigh has been
charged under a federal anti-terrorism statute in the April 19 blast.
Both men are being held at a federal prison in El Reno, Oklahoma. If
convicted, they could face the death penalty.
James Nichols had been in jail for about a month on charges that he
recently helped his brother and McVeigh make and detonate illegal
explosives on his Michigan farm.
Investigators continued to search for a third suspect in the attack.

Osnabruck, Tuesday,
GERMAN police today arrested two escaped HIV-infected convicts and
freed a jail guard hostage unharmed, ending a 51-hour drama in which the
prisoners led police on a zig-zag chase around north Germany.
The men were arrested in the city of Osnabruck, said police spokesman
Klaus-Dieter Tietz.
He said a special police unit captured the kidnappers. In the final
moments of the chase, as police closed in on them, the prisoners threw
DM100 (#43) bills out their car window, he added.
The prisoners had seized the guard at the prison in Celle on Sunday
morning. Thirteen hours later they fled the prison in a Porsche 928
provided by police and DM200,000 (#93,000) in cash.
The escapees had strapped a bomb to their 35-year-old hostage, prison
guard Dietmar Kraft, and warned they would blow all of them to bits if
police tried to hinder their escape.
The escapees, who said they had nothing to lose because they had the
Aids virus, had driven hundreds of miles in a zig-zag course, with
police occasionally losing them.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Jail ruled out for East German spies</HEADLINE>

Bonn, Wednesday
GERMANY'S supreme court today ruled that communist spymasters from the
days of the former East Germany cannot be jailed for their
cloak-and-dagger work against West Germany.
The ruling means dozens of East Germans who ran spy networks in West
Germany will not have to serve sentences that have already been imposed
and others will not have to face trial.
In a verdict that provoked reactions ranging from anger to praise, the
Federal Constitutional Court said justice would not be served by trying
men like legendary spy supremo Markus Wolf.
It ruled that Germany -- reunited in 1990 -- would be acting as a
''foreign power'' if it jailed top spies who had faithfully served the
old East German state and complied with its laws, only to find
unification had turned them into citizens of their arch enemy.
The court distinguished between senior intelligence officials based in
East Germany and the foot soldiers of the Cold War who carried out
spying missions inside West Germany.
''Citizens of the former East Germany who before restoration of German
unity spied for the secret services of their state exclusively from the
territory of East Germany against West Germany may no longer be
prosecuted after reunification because of their espionage,'' it said.
The judges accepted a point stressed by Wolf and others that they had
only done the same work as Bonn's spymasters.
They ruled in favour of freeing East Berlin's senior spies and said
courts in future must decide case by case how to deal with communist
spies caught in West Germany.
West Germans who spied for the East still face the full force of the
law, the justices ruled.
Wolf, who led communist East Germany's foreign intelligence service,
welcomed the court decision as encouraging but said Bonn might continue
persecuting spies.
However Michael Glos, the leader of the conservative Christian Social
Union in Parliament, said: ''East Germany was an unjust state that did
not respect the law. Those who helped prepare and conduct its unjust
deeds do not deserve to be excused.''--Reuter.

Tokyo, Tuesday,
JAPANESE socialists, pacifists, and trade unionists joined a rally
today to back Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's plan to apologise for
Japan's aggression in the Second World War.
Some 3000 people, including at least 40 MPs, crowded the meeting in
central Tokyo to hear demands to compensate sex slaves and forced
labourers.
Right-wing opponents of any apology by Japan for its role in the war
tried to drown out the speeches using loudspeakers mounted on lorries.
Premier Murayama plans to offer Asian and Pacific countries an
unambiguous apology for the war in the form of a parliamentary
resolution to mark the 50th anniversary of its end. Japan surrendered in
August 1945.
Past efforts by Japanese leaders to please nationalist and pacifist
sentiment have produced ambiguous expressions of remorse that countries
such as the two Koreas and China did not accept as forthright apologies.
Opponents of a full apology have also held rallies and claim to have
four million signatures opposing the move in Parliament.
As well as angering right-wing extremists the issue has also exposed
divisions that could unravel Murayama's 11-month-old coalition
government, which partly owes its existence to a deal agreeing to
acknowledge and apologise for Japan's wartime past.

SINN Fein President Gerry Adams today urged Britain to use tomorrow's
historic meeting as the first of a series to seek a political solution
over Northern Ireland.
He also urged Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew to show a
''generosity of spirit'' towards the nationalists' dream of a united
Ireland at their meeting.
''I would like to see it as part of the first of a series of

Nicosia, Tuesday
IN A significant change of tone, Iran's judiciary chief today said his
courts did not have the authority to enforce the death sentence against
Salman Rushdie.
The statement by Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, broadcast on Iranian radio,
appeared to be an attempt to satisfy European demands that Iran distance
itself from the sentence as a prerequisite for improved political and
trade ties.
Yazdi said the 1989 sentence was outside his jurisdiction even though
it was promulgated by the country's former leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
Last weekend an unnamed Iranian official was reported as saying his
government was ''not going to send anyone to assassinate
Rushdie''.--Reuter.

Belgrade, Tuesday,
EFFORTS to get Serbia's hardline President Slobodan Milosevic to
recognise Bosnia collapsed today, but at the same time rebel Serbs in
Bosnia signalled that they may at last agree to peace talks.
American special envoy Robert Frasure left the Serbian capital
Belgrade and has no immediate plans to return, diplomatic sources said,
dashing hopes that Milosevic would recognise Bosnia in exchange for the
easing of crippling UN sanctions.
Russia said President Boris Yeltsin's representative Alexander Zotov
would be in Belgrade tomorrow to try to sort out remaining disputes.
In Paris, the new French Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, linked the
continued presence of French UN troops in Bosnia to a deal with Serbia.
He told the French Parliament that without progress on recognition
''neither France nor its partners could for long maintain its
peacekeepers in the UN Protection Force, whose impotent presence would
have lost all purpose.''
The linkage will increase the pressure on the United States to offer
extra incentives to Milosevic, who is believed to be pushing for a more
generous package of sanctions relief.
The hope is that Serbian recognition of Bosnia will push the Bosnian
Serbs towards accepting an existing international peace deal that they
have so far refused to contemplate.
Today, however, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic offered to
discuss the plan to divide Bosnia in two, suggesting that military
pressure by the Bosnian Government and its Croat allies, and a blockade
of supplies from Belgrade, was wearing the Serbs down.
Karadzic said: ''We would like the Security Council to know that we
are ready to treat the Contact Group's plan as the basis for the
resumption of the peace process.''
His announcement surprised diplomats in Belgrade and one warned: ''We
have to look at the wording of this very carefully.''
Informed sources said Karadzic had told his self-appointed Bosnian
Serb parliament that the plan itself was still unacceptable without
significant changes. It was not clear what compromises were on offer
from Karadzic to restart discussions that have been deadlocked for five
months.
The plan devised by the so-called ''Contact Group'' of Britain,
France, Germany, the United States, and Russia was rejected last July by
the Serbs, who hold 70% of Bosnia after more than three years of war.
Since then the tide of battle has swung against the Serbs, who have
been unnerved by a chance that their former mentor Milosevic might
recognise the state they have been trying to destroy.
On Sunday Karadzic urged Milosevic to resist pressure to do any such
thing, saying it ''will not and must not happen''.
US envoy Frasure's talks with the Serbian President collapsed over the
terms on which UN sanctions could be suspended and the mechanism for
reimposing them if Serbia failed to meet its obligations.
''It's 90% done but there remain some differences over the sanctions
package,'' said one source.--Reuter.

Buenos Aires, Tuesday,
ARGENTINA said today that it would consider a suggestion from a former
adviser to Baroness Thatcher to give #66,000 to every Falkland islander
if they voted to hand British sovereignty to the Argentines.
Buenos Aires Foreign Ministry official Andres Cisneros said the idea
would be considered ''as another element for a future negotiation''.
Sir Alan Walters, one of Lady Thatcher's close advisers when she was
Prime Minister, suggested that Argentina deposit #66,000 for each of the
2000 islanders in a Swiss bank account.
A referendum on sovereignty would then be held and, if 66% agreed on a
transfer, the money would be released.
He made the suggestion at a forum on the fate of the Falklands at the
private Council for Argentine International relations in Buenos Aires.
''It would be one of the greatest bargains of all time as everybody
would be better off,'' Sir Alan Walters said. ''If the islanders say
'no,' we must try again in three years as time may prove the great
healer.''
Despite its defeat in the 1982 Falklands War Argentina has continued
to pursue control of the South Atlantic archipelago through diplomatic
means.
''What I'm saying is that for $200m (#132m), all tensions could be
removed from the South Atlantic. Relations between Argentina and Great
Britain could be improved and both countries would be able to
significantly reduce military expenditures,'' Sir Alan said.
Almost 1000 servicemen during the 74-day war over the islands. Britain
has since maintained a garrison on the islands.
Argentina, which maintains that Britain usurped the South Atlantic
archipelago in 1833, last year enshrined its sovereignty claims in its
national constitution.
President Carlos Menem, who won a second term in May 14 elections, has
vowed to recover the islands by 2000 through diplomatic channels.
Menem has said Argentina would be willing to pay cash for sovereignty,
an offer Falkland Islands Governor David Tatham has dismissed as
''seduction and bribery''.
Sir Alan, on a two-day visit, said Britain was considering a leaseback
of the islands to Argentina in 1980, but that the idea was shelved after
General Galtieri ordered an invasion.--AP/Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Two Ebola cases feared in capital</HEADLINE>

Kinshasa, Tuesday,
TWO possible cases of the deadly Ebola virus have surfaced in Zaire's
capital Kinshasa, doctors fighting to contain the disease said today.
The report was the first in the city of five million people since a
nurse with a fever absconded from hospital just over a week ago,
triggering a frantic hunt to trace her.
That and a second suspected case proved false alarms.
So far the epidemic, which has killed at least 101 people, has been
confined to Zaire's Bandundu Province, particularly its main town of
Kikwit, 300 miles from the capital.
''A suspected case from Kinshasa University Hospital has been reported
to the Health Minister,'' said Dr Paluku Kalenga, a member of a
government commission fighting to contain the virus.
''The lady in question came from Kahemba, near the Angolan border. She
is now staying at a house in Kinshasa, but health officials are still
keeping a close eye on her.''
The head of the commission, Bompenda Bonkumo, said there was another
suspected case in the city but declined to elaborate.
The disease, spread by contact with blood or bodily fluids, kills by
causing uncontrollable bleeding. There is no known vaccine or cure.
Doctors in Kikwit, on the look-out for a surge in cases as the virus
incubates, say this week could prove critical.
''This is a key week,'' said David Heymann, an American doctor with
the WHO.
''Looking at what happened previously we can see that every 10 days or
so the number of cases quadrupled,'' he said of a 1976 outbreak which
killed hundreds of people in the village of Yambuku. ''We have to see if
the same will happen this time.''
The latest death toll from the World Health Organisation, which is
tracking the disease from Geneva, dates back to Sunday. It showed 101 of
137 confirmed victims had died -- up from 97 deaths by Saturday.
However, although the WHO in Kinshasa reported no new deaths today,
journalists who visited Kikwit yesterday saw five Ebola victims being
buried.
Today a sixth nun based in Kikwit died of the virus and another has
its symptoms. The latest victim is a 58-year-old mother superior of the
order in Africa who went to help the others when the disease broke out.
Journalists who visited the town of 500,000 people yesterday reported
a further seven deaths, although it was not immediately clear whether
all seven could be blamed on Ebola.
A Swiss woman just returned from Zaire has been put in hospital in
Switzerland on suspicion of having the virus.
Earlier, fresh supplies of disposable gloves, masks, and protective
clothing from the US were rushed to Kikwit General Hospital, where they
were running short.
The WHO in Geneva, which hopes to contain the disease with proper
clinical safeguards and a public information campaign, said more
countries were coming forward with aid and that the total now pledged
topped #1.3m.
Red Cross regional representative Adelhalim Senouci said fresh
supplies were on their way to Zaire. ''It was bad planning to allow
equipment to run short. The problem is that because it is disposable so
much is needed.''
The WHO says basic sanitary protection and an information campaign on
how the virus spreads should be enough to contain the epidemic, as in
1976.
Meanwhile, it emerged in Japan that the doomsday cult accused in the
Tokyo subway gas attack was interested in the deadly Ebola virus.
Cult scientist Seiichi Endo included it in a discussion of possible
biological weapons agents during a radio broadcast from Moscow in
December.
Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) also once sent a medical mission to
Zaire.
Both Endo and Aum leader Shoko Asahara are in jail in connection with
the deadly March 20 nerve gas attack.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister firmly told a Euro-sceptic Tory yesterday that he
will not yield an inch on subsidiarity at next year's Great Summit on
the future of Europe.
The Foreign Secretary was absolutely right, he added, to say that the
Community should stay out of the nooks and crannies of everyday life in
Britain.
Yesterday, many MPs were more bothered about the nooks and crannies of
everyday life in the Commons, into which the Nolan Committee threatened
to shine a gigantic spotlight.
To them, Mr Major could offer little comfort. He picked his words
carefully when Mr Blair sought to pin him down to a commitment that any
Commons committee on Nolan will take the report as read, and simply
discuss how to translate its recommendations into House rules.
Would he also make clear, asked Mr Blair pleasantly, that this
committee would not hang about but would report by July?
Some MPs -- it would not perhaps be uncharitable to suppose those with
large earnings from consultancies which Nolan wishes them to declare --
feel that a timescale of, say, up to the next election would be
preferable.
After all, given the current state of the opinion polls, several of
them will not be here afterwards and so will not be parliamentary
consultants.
Mr Major -- probably aware of several dozen pairs of critical eyes
boring at a point between his shoulder blades, which could start feeling
particularly itchy round about November -- temporized a little.
An ''interim report'' might be available then, he suggested, which was
greeted with suspicious grunts and cries from the Opposition side.
How ''interim'' would ''interim'' be, the grunts seemed to ask; the
cries came from those quicker thinkers who had already decided that Mr
Major's reply had fallen short of a cast-iron guarantee.
Falling short of giving cast-iron guarantees is, however, part of a
Prime Minister's job and Mr Major was also obliged to fall short of
providing a cast-iron rebuttal of a press report suggesting that the
Cabinet was about to decide to give up efforts to reclaim areas of
influence from the EU at the next summit.
Mr Major told his Euro-sceptic inquirer that the report in question
had been ''speculating on decisions on matters that are still under
discussion, have not remotely been concluded and will not be concluded
for some time.''
Now, struck several times with a hammer, that assurance would not, the
Sketch felt, give out the sound of cast- iron.
What Mr Bernard Jenkin (Colchester -- Con.) had been looking for was
something like: ''That report was absolutely wrong. We are determined to
retrieve national powers which Europe has stolen and we will do so if I
have to hang Kohl and Chirac up by the thumbs''.
Perhaps the bit about thumbs could have been left to a private chat,
but to the Euro-sceptics Mr Major's words, however true, must have had a
rather cardboardy, provisional feel about them.
Thinking about iron and certitude brings us naturally to Lady
Thatcher.
Labour MP Tony Banks declared himself an admirer of the Prime
Minister, thus signalling he was up to no good, and said he considered
that the noble Baroness had treated Mr Major disgracefully in the second
volume of her memoirs likening him to ''an incompetent train spotter''.
Readers must be clear that this was Mr Banks's interpretation of
advance reports of the memoirs which, in fact, make no reference to
train spotting, competent or otherwise.
Would he like to take this opportunity, asked Mr Banks expansively, to
''damn Mrs Thatcher and all her policies'' which had got him and his
Government into the appalling mess they were now in.
One thing about which Mr Major could have given a cast- iron
guarantee, if asked, was that he would not criticise his predecessor
with the House of Commons and the nation looking on. In fact -- which
might be significant -- he decided not to mention the Lady at all.
It was less of a surprise to hear Mr Banks was an admirer than a shock
and a disappointment, he declared and sat down.
Silence on any given topic can sometimes be more eloquent than words.

THE Prime Minister yesterday appeared to bow to Labour pressure for
fast action on implementing new rules governing the behaviour and
business dealings of MPs.
He called for ''rapid progress'' by a new committee of senior MPs
being set up to assess the hard-hitting recommendations of the Nolan
Committee on standards in public life -- and set a mid-July target for
the publication of its initial findings.
The two main parties were locked in secret talks at Westminster on the
role of the new committee but a breakthrough was widely expected by
today.
The main sticking point over the committee -- a dispute over whether
it was being established to alter or to deliver the Nolan proposals --
seemed to have been resolved with the Government's apparent acceptance
that its purpose was to ease the implementation of sometimes complex
proposals.
Labour had accused the Government of attempting to delay the proposals
to pacify angry backbench Tories who object to being made to disclose
outside earnings.
However, Mr Major yesterday reinforced his determination to restore
shaken public confidence in Parliament in the wake of the Nolan
Committee inquiry.
''We have now seen the report and I have said repeatedly that I favour
greater transparency and I accept the broad principles of the Nolan
committee,'' he told Labour leader Tony Blair.
''But we do need to examine how that will work and what its
implications will be for Parliament.
''That needs to be done. I hope it can be done on an all-party basis.
I believe that would be in the interests of the House, so that the whole
country can see that the House is seeking to live up to the highest
standards that I wish it to have and I believe you have said you wish it
to have.''
Mr Blair, stepping up the pressure on a subject on where the
Opposition believes it cannot lose, called for a commitment to swift
action from the committee.
Mr Major said detailed proposals were under discussion with Shadow
Commons Leader Ann Taylor.
''I would certainly anticipate that the committee would make rapid
progress. I would certainly hope that there could be agreement that
there would be at least an interim report before the House rises for the
summer recess,'' he said.
''But I think the committee itself must determine how rapidly it can
discuss these matters.''
Some Labour MPs suspect the softer Government line on Nolan -- first
signalled on Monday night when Mr Major announced the committee would be
charged with implementing the proposals -- was the direct result of a
behind-the-scenes deal with Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd.
They argued that the change flowed directly from the swift and -- in
their view -- lenient treatment of Tory MP Sir Jerry Wiggin over his
involvement in the cash-for-amendments affair.
Labour MP Peter Hain -- whose Commons motion demanding the case be
sent to the Privileges Committee was signed by 80 backbench colleagues
-- said: ''There was a remarkable coincidence between Sir Jerry
apologising and the Prime Minister leaping into life after the
Government fudged the issue of implementing Nolan on Thursday.
''I think the Speaker is exasperated by these repeated sleaze
allegations, and I am sure she wants to see Nolan implemented
speedily.''
Sources close to the Commons authorities denied reports of a deal but
noted the ''coincidence'' of the timing.
* Later, Labour's Bill Michie (Sheffield Heeley) a member of the
Members' Interests Select Committee which is investigating allegations
involving Tory ex-Minister Neil Hamilton, raised the issue of ''sleaze''
again.
Mr Michie said: ''Bearing in mind the sleaze and the conduct of this
place . . . if you want to demonstrate to the public at large that we
are going to get our act together in this place, will you approach your
members on the Interests Committee to stop blocking the consideration of
evidence and remove the Tory whip so we can proceed in a proper
democratic way?''
Labour MPs, including Mr Michie, walked out of the committee last week
after a row about which witnesses should be called.
The committee is looking into claims, strongly disputed by Mr
Hamilton, that he failed properly to disclose a stay at the Ritz Hotel
in Paris.
Mr Major told the Labour MP: ''You know the powers, influence and
independence of committees like the Members' Interests Committee. You
also know the membership of that committee is approved by this House
before it sits.''

TOUGH new targets have been set for the Scottish Prison Service for
1995-96 by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
He said last night in a Commons written reply to Eastwood Tory MP
Allan Stewart that, on the number of prisoners unlawfully at large, no
category 'A' prisoners should escape, and that the number of escapes by
'B' category should be no higher than 2.3 per 1000 prisoners.
The number of significant incidents should be no higher than 10, the
number of serious assaults on staff should be no higher than four per
1000, and the number of serious assaults on other prisoners should be no
higher than 10 per 1000.
The key targets have been set for the prison service against a series
of performance measures.
On basic quality of life for prisoners, the Government wants to see,
by April 1996, 63% of available prisoner places having access to forms
of night sanitation.
On available opportunities for prisoners' self-development, 85% of
convicted prisoners should have the opportunity of at least seven hours
per working day of programmed activities. And on average 30% of
unconvicted prisoners' time (seven hours out of every 24) should be
available for out of cell activities.
There also is a target to keep average annual costs to #26,724 per
prisoner place.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''These are realistic
targets which have been drawn up after careful consideration and in the
light of experience from the operation of the prison service in recent
years. We are confident they can be met.''

BRITAIN was consulted before the FBI put the two men accused of the
Lockerbie bombing on its ''Ten Most Wanted'' list with a $4m reward for
their capture, the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger said last night.
The US Justice and State departments spoke to both the Crown Office
and Foreign Office, he siad.
The Lord Advocate was responding to Labour demands to say if Britain
was consulted by the Americans about a move which the party said had the
''ring of international banditry'' and could encourage bounty hunters.
In a letter to Lord Macaulay, Opposition spokesman in the Lords on
Scottish legal affairs, Lord Rodger rejected the ''extravagant
interpretation'' he put on the US move.
The Foreign Office and Crown Office were consulted before the FBI
announcement, Lord Rodger said.
Britain made it ''quite clear'' that if the two Libyans accused of the
bombing were acquitted in Scotland, they would be allowed to return to
Libya.
''We told the Americans that we were content with their proposal to
place the two men charged with this most serious crime on the list of
Ten Most Wanted fugitives'', he said.

<TEXT>
THE UK will continue to have the world's most generous compensation
scheme for crime victims even after controversial changes in the way
awards are calculated, Home Secretary Michael Howard told the Commons
yesterday.
He was speaking during the second reading debate on the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Bill which sets out a tariff of awards, with a
payment set for each injury according to severity.
A late concession after protests from victims' groups, peers and
unions means it also offers extra help in the most serious cases.
Mr Howard was forced to bring in the Bill after Law Lords ruled he
acted unlawfully by not seeking Parliament's approval before introducing
a new tariff-based scheme in 1994 to replace the existing common law
damages scheme.
He said: ''The enhanced tariff scheme provides the right balance
between the needs of victims and the interests of taxpayers.''
Mr Howard said that #165m was paid out in compensation to 65,293
people in 1993-94, which was more than double the cost six years before.
Without reform the scheme would cost an estimated and ''not
sustainable'' #460m by the year 2000-01 and the cumulative cost over the
five years from 1996-97 to 2000-01 would be about #1.8bn.
Under the proposed new scheme, annual costs would continue to rise
each year, but to about #260m-a-year by 2000-01 and about #1.1bn over
the five years to then.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said: ''Throughout, you have shown an
arrogant disregard for the proper procedures of Parliament and a
contempt for the victims of violent crime.
The increase in the scheme's costs had arisen largely from ''the
failure of the Government to control the relentless rise in violent
crime'', Mr Straw said.
''This is a Government which promised to control crime, to create
greater law and order, and has palpably failed to do so.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Simon Hughes warned there were still
areas in criminal compensation that needed to be improved and were not
addressed by the Government's plans.
Not enough emphasis was being placed on cutting crime, he said. ''The
fewer crimes there are, the fewer victims there are and the less the
public will be asked to pay.''

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson last night sought to
reassure Scots businessmen in London, that Labour's devolution plans
would not threaten the competitiveness of Scottish business.
Corporate tax would remain the preserve of Parliament at Westminster,
he said, and Britain would continue to operate as a single market. ''We
have no intention to alter the rules for Scottish business competing in,
and in some cases dominating, the British scene,'' he added.
Mr Robertson said: ''Indeed, the economic powers of the parliament --
over the Scottish Enterprise network, the training budget, and Locate in
Scotland, for example -- will all be deployed to create the most
advantageous environment for Scottish-based business to thrive and
develop.''
Addressing the quarterly meeting of the Scottish Council Development
and Industry, Mr Robertson emphasised that a Scottish parliament's right
to increase the standard rate of income tax by up to 3p in the pound was
''only a power and not a policy''.
He said: ''It will provide the parliament with a mix of financial
flexibility and discipline and is likely to be exercised only with great
caution and patience.''
His speech was clearly intended to be part of the reassurance campaign
Labour is running on its economic policies, as it seeks to win the
confidence of the City and industry in advance of the next election.
Mr Robertson said a Scottish parliament would be able to legislate in
all areas currently controlled by the Scottish Office: ''But it will not
trespass on to the commerical territory of the Single British Market.
''UK corporate taxation will continue to be the responsibility of the
Westminster Parliament, as will the UK regulatory framework for
financial services.''
A Scottish parliament could undertake an audit of the strengths and
weaknesses of the Scottish economy. ''The Audit of Scotland is vitally
needed to establish what our business strengths are, and what can be
done by public or private sectors to get maximum advantage.''
Mr Robertson also defended devolution on constitutional grounds, and
claimed no national company would adopt the Government's ''no change''
approach for its constitution.
''No change is simply not an option and, in a democracy crying out for
modernisation, it is the most inappropriate option of all,'' he said.

JOHN Godfrey is the only candidate to have failed to endorse a
statement issued by numerous organisations after last week's
STUC-sponsored Save Our Railways conference.
Last night Richard Leonard, spokesman for the railways campaign, urged
voters in Perth and Kinross to back only those candidates who oppose
privatisation.
He said: ''We are astonished that, in the face of cuts in Scotland's
railway services, the Tory candidate is standing by privatisation. Perth
has long been an important railway city and the threat posed to services
north of Perth is undoubtably an issue of concern to constituents.''
Last week's conference, attended by the business community, local
authorities, churches, rail unions, political parties, and others,
condemned the decision to withdraw subsidies from several sleeper
services and Motorail.
It also opposed restructuring which would fragment the railway network
and lead to a further deterioration in services. There was a call to the
Government to ''pull back from this most damaging privatisation''.
The conference, in a submission to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, sought
an immediate moratorium on actions which would further threaten the
future of rail services before full public consultations were concluded.
Mr Godfrey said that some common ground was shared in that he wished
to see the best possible future for the railway system. However, he
could not endorse the statement made by Save Our Railways.
The Tory candidate argued that it appeared that the STUC had already
rejected even a constructive appraisal of privatisation plans.
He added: ''I firmly believe that privatisation represents the best
future for our railways, not only in improving the quality of existing
services but in generating the necessary investment for the future.
''In addition, the statement does not seem to offer any constructive
alternatives to our privatisation plans. I do not believe that simply
returning to the old rail structure is a viable option.''

As the frontrunner draws clear in the final straight, Robbie Dinwoodie
studies the form.
NOT everyone has a firm and crystal-clear recollection of the defining
moment in their life which emotionally underpinned their politics and
determined the future course of their lives.
The last MP for Perth and Kinross did. He was fond of recalling his
response to the khaki election which swept Labour to power after the
war. The young Nicky Fairbairn rushed out and stoned the windows of the
local Co-op, the most visible manifestation of the accursed socialists
he so loathed.
For the woman now destined to succeed him, the image different and the
emotion was not anger but sorrow. As an excited eight-year-old from
Glasgow, she boarded a liner at Southampton with her mother, father, and
wee brother to make a new life in Australia. It was June 1960, a bright
day, and as the quayside thronged with relatives of other families, the
band ended Waltzing Matilda and struck up Will Ye No' Come Back Again.
The young girl had never thought about her Scottishness before but she
suddenly burst into tears at the realisation that she was leaving home.
A few weeks later, she blew out the nine candles on her birthday cake
in Perth, Western Australia, and made a wish; to return to Scotland one
day. Now she stands poised to represent the original Perth at
Westminster after a by-election in which she and her team have barely
put a foot wrong.
It has been interesting to watch the SNP handle the unaccustomed
burden of running a candidate who has led the field.
As underdog, you can come out fighting, rummelling up the favourite,
creating fights, charging the atmosphere, goading, provoking. The SNP
has in the past been good at that and in Roseanna Cunningham they would
have had an ideal candidate in such a situation -- quick of temper,
combative, feisty, a martial arts exponent with a feminist approach
which rightly rejects adopting a passive role as a victim.
Instead, the candidate has reigned in all of that, kept it all smiles,
laughs, and shrugs. It has been skilfully done.
The more she has been castigated by all the other candidates as a
dangerous and unrepresentive extremist, the more she has smiled and
laughed and turned up the positive body language. Scottish Nationalism
equates with Nazism? Kiss a few babies. Dangerous republican extremist?
Cuddle some old ladies.
This performance has achieved a number of things. First, it has
exploded the opponents' accusation that the SNP always cheats by picking
horses for courses, matching candidates to the perceived prejudices of
the constituency -- a leftist for an urban seat, a ''tartan Tory'' in a
rural area.
Ms Cunningham, noted republican socialist of this parish, burst into
raucous laughter over this idea yesterday, for ''Republican Rose'' is
romping to victory in a Tory-held seat with more than double the support
being accorded to New Labour, according to our poll yesterday and
another newspaper which confirmed this last night.
Secondly, it has done no harm at all to the general cause of making
the republican view more widely acceptable. Ms Cunningham was pinned on
her opposition to the monarchy at the outset of the campaign. Although
she emphasised it was not high on her list of priorities and she
accepted her party's pro-monarchy line, she was goaded into describing
the Queen as ''the pinnacle of the class system''.
The Tories have gone on about this relentlessly and even Labour have
called it a gaffe which has damaged the SNP campaign. Ms Cunningham
asserts that perhaps in this day and age opposing the monarchy is not
the automatic vote loser than has been assumed. Should she win by
awhopping margin of several thousand votes, in a rural, Tory-held
constituency, what will that tell us?
Thirdly, there is the ''clone'' factor, so resoundingly highlighted by
the late MP in his criticism of his successor. Ms Cunningham admits she
disagrees with her party on the issue of the monarchy. Would not Mr
Godfrey have done better to disagree with one or two policy issues of
his own party? Or Douglas Alexander done better by showing a bit of
passion and independent thought for an issue, any issue?
Ms Cunningham, a 43-year-old High Court defence lawyer, has been
frankly delighted by the one-dimensional nature of her opponents'
campaign. She expected the early onslaught on her republican views but
was clearly shocked by the claim that the SNP could be equated to the
German Nazis -- a gaffe to which she gave a forceful and impassioned
response at the time.
However, when the VE weekend passed and ''Republican Rose'' became a
daily refrain, she was shocked.
''We began to wonder when they would begin to get round to talking
about their own poicies,'' she said. ''Ten days in, it became clear that
they were running a one-note campaign. We realised it wasn't an opening
tactic but their entire strategy we thought, 'How extraordinary! How can
they think they can sustain that through the campaign?' ''
Her own campaign opened with the overture from Hell, with her being
forced out of the candidature by the revelation that many years ago she
had a relationship with the estranged husband of Margaret Bain, now
Margaret Ewing SNP MP.
For a single woman to have such a relationship seemed innocuous but
the row was front page news and Ms Cunningham had to be persuaded to
re-enter the fray. Having done so, she was selected by a resounding 14-4
vote and the constituency had themselves an instantly famous candidate.
Attacks from rivals have served only to keep things that way.
The bright yellow sweatshirts paraded in Perth last Saturday dispensed
with the surname and proclaimed simply Roseanna!
But will her reputation work against her as she tries to forge the
relationship with the electorate that would prevent the Tories
recapturing the seat? ''Not if I work hard enough,'' she said. As an
advocate who stands up for people in court she should be able to
represent Perthshire farmers.
''I will do exactly the same kind of job as Alex Salmond, Andrew
Welsh, and Margaret Ewing. I have been straight and honest with people
and spoke language they can accept.
''What people are looking for is whether you are the kind of person
who can represent their interests as MP. My opponents' tactics in
attacking me have simply served to make me appear as a strong candidate.
''What John Godfrey betrayed all the way through this campaign was
that he doesn't understand Scottish politics. The kindest thing you can
say is that this was because of how long he has lived in the south. He
can't take on board what he has little experience of. The debate here is
quite different but he has tried to press the buttons that would have
worked in the south.''
Some issues such as pensions, benefits, and the minimum wage are not
seen in the same ideological way north of the border, but are viewed
simply as matters of decent values. Even the term socialist, which she
is happy to use of herself, does not have the same connotations as it
does in the south.
From this flows her conviction that New Labour has lost its way: ''Ask
them for hard commitments, the single policy they would reverse if they
came to power. If the choice is between a Conservative Government with a
capital C or a Conservative Government with a capital L what choice is
that? Labour is no longer an aspirational party and that is why we will
go on from this victory.''

THERE were the first signs of recrimination last night among rival
political camps as the SNP continued its surge towards victory in the
Perth and Kinross by-election.
Following yesterday's Herald poll by System 3, showing the SNP 29
points ahead of Labour in a poor second place, a poll in another
Scottish newspaper confirmed that the SNP was surging ahead and that the
Labour bandwagon, which had been pushed under the personal imprint of
Labour leader Tony Blair, had stalled.
The ICM poll for Scottish Television and the Scotsman put SNP even
further ahead with 55% of the vote, three points further than System 3,
and Labour lagging a further two points behind on 21%.
The Tory decline is confirmed at 14%, one point down on The Herald
poll, and the Liberal Democrats are showing no real movement on 10%, one
point up on our reckoning. The levels of voters saying they either
didn't know, would not say, or were determined not to vote totalled 31%,
again broadly similar to our figures.
Earlier in the day, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang had made an 11th hour
appeal to the voters in the constituency not to indulge in a ''dangerous
flirtation with a Nationalist protest vote''.
Labour candidate Douglas Alexander, who had appeared visibly upset
when news emerged of yesterday's Herald poll, said last night: ''The
central message of these opinion polls is that the Tories are being
completely routed in this by-election and we take great satisfaction
from that.
''The fact for the electors now is that they must focus their
attention exclusively on how they deliver defeat to the Tories. They
don't want separatism and they should choose Labour.''
There is still no sign of the progress hoped for by the Liberal
Democrat camp in spite of a visit over the last two days by leader Paddy
Ashdown. He launched a scathing attack yesterday on the Labour Party for
stealing the policies and language of the Tories while putting up
nothing positive of their own.
Last night, his candidate Veronica Linklater said the latest poll
showed the Tories crumbling and Labour in decline.
She said: ''There is still a large group of people undecided and we
hope to win them over in the final two days. There is still all to play
for.''
Speaking of the chances of success for SNP candidate Roseanna
Cunningham, party Chief Executive Michael Russell said: ''This latest
poll confirms, like all the others, that the SNP are well ahead. It
proves that our positive message for Scotland is getting across
throughout the constituency.''

NEGOTIATORS for the trade union Unison decided yesterday to recommend
that a claim for an additional average top-up increase of #5 a week be
lodged on behalf of its 860,000 local authority members.
As revealed in The Herald several weeks ago, Unison decided to invoke
a reopener clause in the two-year agreement which is about to trigger
second-stage increases of 1.4%, plus one-off payments of #100.
The GMB has since followed suit, and the TGWU is expected to do the
same.
The three unions represent about 1.5 million blue-collar and white-
collar local authority employees -- 100,000 of them in Scotland.
However, the national employers yesterday launched their own
pre-emptive strike by advising authorities of their ''firm view'' that,
as things stand, ''there can be no question of the employers agreeing to
reopening what was agreed last October''.
Last autumn, the unions accepted a two-stage deal involving 1.5% plus
#100, to be followed this June by a further 1.4% plus #100 and due to
run until next April.
It included an acceptance that the unions could seek to reopen
negotiations if inflation, local government finance or public-sector pay
settlements ''take unexpected turns''.
The unions argue that, at the time of last year's settlement,
inflation was running at 2.2% and that it is now 3.3%, with average
earnings increasing at a similar level.
However, in a bulletin to local authorities, the national employers
emphasise that ''there have been no such unexpected turns of events ''
and that, for as long as that is the case, talks could not be reopened.
Unison head of local government Mr Keith Sonnet said the employers
must not be allowed to back out of their commitment. He is advising
branches to call meetings to discusss campaigning for talks to be
reopened.
A glance at the agenda for next month's Unison agenda shows just why
officials are pressing for reopening.
There are a dozen motions all deeply critical of the deal and several
seeking to censure the negotiators while several others -- including
those from Strathclyde region and Glasgow district -- demand that talks
be reopened in order to negotiate top-up increases.

LIBERAL Democrat Transport spokesman Paul Tyler will today mark the
end of sleeper services between the West Country and Scotland by
publishing figures and correspondence from Ministers contradicting
claims that there is no demand for the link. The strongest evidence he
will offer of the service's popularity, however, will be his own
experience. He had intended to travel on Friday's last train, but was

this fiasco -- a cock-up or a conspiracy,'' he said.

SPIRALLING costs and delays in key defence projects are hampering the
ability of the armed forces to respond to military threats, according to
a report out today.
More than 90% of leading projects are late by an average of over three
years with serious knock-on effects -- and the problem is getting worse,
the National Audit Office said.
Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark accused Ministers of ''gross
financial incompetence'' and said it belied the Government claim to be
putting front-line forces at the top of its list of priorities.
The worst offenders identified in the report included:
* Eurofighter 2000, where ''over-optimistic'' initial estimates and
other difficulties have seen costs rise by #1.13 bn
* Spearfish torpedo, seven years late and #175m over budget
* Bowman radio system, four years late and #12m over budget

A BILL to allow registrars to carry out civil naming ceremonies in
register offices was introduced in the Commons yesterday. Senior Labour
MP Frank Field said his Naming Ceremonies and Parental Responsibilities
Bill was a response to the dramatic decline in baptisms. It would
provide an alternative to baptism and an ''occasion for both sides of
the family to come together and celebrate the great event of birth and
welcome the child into the community''. His Bill was given a formal
first reading without a vote, but stands no chance of becoming law.

A REVIEW of internal security in Britain's intelligence agencies was
called for yesterday by the new parliamentary committee set up to
oversee their operations.
The committee's first interim report identified the protection of
agency information and operations from traitors as one of the ''major
issues'' needing further investigation.
It said the case of Aldrich Ames, the American double agent who sold
CIA secrets to the Soviet Union during the Cold War, provided the
''starkest possible warnings of the disastrous consequences'' if
security was neglected.
The committee chairman, former Defence Secretary Tom King, told a news
conference that although Britain's major spy scandals were some time
ago, there was no room for complacency.
''There is no point in gathering secrets and building an intelligence
service for the protection and security of our country unless you
protect them,'' he said.
''It is very much part of our concern to review with them how adequate
and well maintained these systems are.''
Ames's activities over nine years led to the deaths of at least 10 CIA
sources in Russia and compromised around 100 operations. Mr King
confirmed that ''British interests'' were also damaged.
Ames, currently serving a life sentence in America, has claimed that
he betrayed Oleg Gordievsky the Russian double agent who was spying for
the British and subsequently escaped to the West.

SUPPORTERS of Transport and General Workers' Union general secretary
Bill Morris claim that he has a huge lead among union members in
Scotland in his campaign for re-election.
They said yesterday that Scottish branch nominations showed 301 for Mr
Morris and only 38 for the challenger, national secretary Jack Dromey,
and that 53 branches from the union's public services group, headed by
Mr Dromey, actually nominated Mr Morris.
Key Scottish branches nominating Mr Morris include Strathclyde Bus,
United Biscuits, Distillers and a number of local authorities while
those nominating Mr Dromey include Rosyth RN dockyard, Royal Ordnance,
Bishopton, and Glacier Metals.
Mr Dromey will today renew his contacts with union leaders from the
royal naval dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport -- they too are backing Mr
Dromey's challenge -- when they join forces to lobby Parliament in
opposition to the proposed sale of the yards, which he claims could mean
a further 2000 jobs being lost.
Mr Dromey maintains he has received nominations from the union's
largest branches, as well as from every region and every trade group.
As the union has 7000 branches, not too much should be read into the
overall breakdown of nominations which showed a total of 844 for Morris,
383 for Dromey and four for Kent tractor driver Norman Davidson.
Postal voting will get under way soon, with balloting ending on June
16 and the result due to be declared on June 23.

<TEXT>
A MOTHER was found guilty of inflicting ''staggering'' injuries on her
son by burning him with cigarettes and scalding him with hot water, at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
The child, aged between one year and 18 months at the time, was left
with second degree burns over almost six percent of his body.
Yesterday, the jury unanimously found the 25-year-old woman, who has
two other children, guilty of wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, and
neglecting her baby.
The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child,
repeatedly slapped the child, burned his hand with cigarettes, scalded
him to his severe injury, failed to feed and clean him properly, and
failed to get him proper medical attention.
The incidents occured between January and August 1993. The woman
admitted failing to appear for an earlier trial date in October 1994.
Dr Thomas Clark told the trial that he was called out just before 2am
to the house where the mother was staying at the time, after a report of
a baby being burned.
He described a large burn on the child's left thigh, another large
scald on the right lower leg, and smaller burned areas around a foot and
on a hand.
He had been told the baby had been playing with hot water earlier but
said the explanation was not consistent with the injuries.
''Nor could I believe that a child playing with hot water could
inflict upon himself such major burns,'' Dr Clark told the court.
He decided that the boy was in danger and had him taken to the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children, in Edinburgh.
Professor Anthony Busuttil, of the forensic medicine department at
Edinburgh University, examined the youngster and concluded that it was
unlikely that several of the injuries, especially the four cigarette
burns, could have been accidental.
''The multiplicity of bruises and other injuries on this child are
staggering,'' he wrote in his notes at the time.
A woman, with whom the mother was staying when the scalding happened,
told the court that her boyfriend called the doctor after hearing the
baby crying and discovering the burns.
The mother's solicitor, Mr Kenny McFarlane, told Sheriff Peter
McNeill, QC, that none of her three children now lived with her.
Sheriff McNeill deferred sentence until June 13, for background
reports and, as she was a first offender, allowed the woman to remain on
bail.

A HUSBAND revealed yesterday that while his wife's dead body lay
undiscovered by police in her crashed car -- thieves broke in and stole
the stereo.
Mr Les London's wife, Sally, 39, of Lidlington, Bedfordshire, was
found dead in her car in a cornfield at nearby Ridgemont, close to the
M1 last Thursday, 36 hours after the crash.
After the discovery, it emerged that, 24 hours earlier, police had
gone to the scene and put a ''Police aware'' sticker on the up-turned
Ford Capri, failing to notice the body inside.
The Londons had recently separated after 11 years of marriage.
Yesterday, Mr London, 49, said of the theft of the radio: ''The very
thought of someone breaking into the car and stealing things as Sally
lay there is sickening.
''How could they calmly commit such an act while my wife was lying
there. It is the most callous and despicable thing to do.''
He explained: ''She was visiting her niece in Milton Keynes the night
she crashed.
''I know that when she left Milton Keynes the stereo was still in the
car because her niece has told me so.
''She hadn't mentioned having the stereo taken to anybody. It was
missing when the car was discovered. It must have been stolen as the car
lay in the field.
''This has upset us more than anything else -- even more than the fact
police may have missed Sally's body when they checked the car. It is the
final blow to us all.''
A Bedfordshire police spokesman said yesterday: ''We can confirm we
are investigating the fact that a radio may have been stolen from the
car between the time of the accident on Tuesday evening and the
discovery of Mrs London's body on Thursday morning.
''Relatives have told us that the radio was in place on Tuesday
evening when Mrs London visited Milton Keynes.''
A post-mortem examination showed that Mrs London, a solicitor's
secretary, died almost instantly when her car left the road.
She left Milton Keynes at 9.10pm for the 30-minute drive back to the
house she had been renting in Ampthill, Bedfordshire.
Bedfordshire Police announced yesterday that two officers have been
suspended pending an investigation into how Mrs London's body was not
discovered.
A spokesman said the outcome would depend upon the findings of a
Police Complaints Authority investigation into the incident.
The investigation was requested by Mr Michael O'Byrne, deputy chief
constable of Bedfordshire Police.
The spokesman added: ''The officers, both PCs, have been suspended on
full pay until such time as the investigation is completed.''
It is not believed there was a complaint from the dead woman's family.
PCA member Mr Tony Williams, who will oversee the inquiry, said: ''I
can understand the public concern about this tragic case. I will ensure
that a thorough and impartial inquiry is conducted.''
Superintendent Ralph Miller, of Bedfordshire Police, has been
appointed investigating officer.

A SCOTTISH local authority is set to launch a wide-ranging sports
strategy which it believes could provide a benchmark for the unitary
councils established under local government reorganisation.
Lothian region will shortly set out a ''clear statement of policy''
which it maintains will reinforce its considerable commitment to sport.
In the document, Councillor Elizabeth Maginnis, chairwoman of the
council's education committee, says sports provision in Lothian is at
the forefront of national developments.
The policy statement, to be issued next week in Edinburgh, identifies
key areas including ''the essential ingredient'' of joint initiatives to
develop opportunities for all ages.
Continued partnership with sports governing bodies such as the
Scottish Rugby Union and the Scottish Football Association, along with
district councils and the Scottish Sports Council, is seen as vital to
the policy strategy.
While the aim is to achieve the widest possible participation in sport
it will also pay special attention to opportunities arising through
specialism and excellence in sport.
The local authority is looking at ways of bringing the most talented
youngsters together to receive special tuition and ''advance their
talent to the highest possible level''.
The region is also looking at developing sport through sponsorship and
believes provision of first-class facilities is fundamental to any
sporting policy.
When Lothian region, which has had a sports unit since 1993, splits
up, four new authorities will take over.

A SCOTS woman who was given emergency surgery on board a flight from
Hong Kong was well enough to leave hospital last night.
Mrs Pauline Dixon, 39, from Torry, Aberdeen, left Ashford general
hospital in London after being warned not to fly for several weeks.
The doctors who saved her life played down the operation carried out
at 35,000ft. Professor Angus Wallace, head of the orthopaedic department
at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, was praised for his quick
actions as he gave a graphic demonstration of the operation he carried
out using improvised surgical instruments.
After diagnosing a collapsed lung, shortly after the plane had taken
off, he said he inserted a straightened coathanger into a catheter and
sterilised it with brandy before draining Mrs Dixon's lung into a bottle
of mineral water.
He was assisted by Dr Tom Wong, a senior house officer at Stracathro
Hospital, near Brechin. Saying he did not want to be interviewed on
television or radio, he stressed he had played only a minor role in the
operation and expressed surprise at the attention the doctors' action
had attracted.
Dr Wong said credit for the operation must go to Professor Wallace.
Mrs Dixon had been returning home from a 10-day trip to Hong Kong
where she was visiting her sister Kathleen.
She had been involved in a motor-cycle crash during her holiday and
suffered a collapsed lung 20 minutes after the flight to Heathrow took
off.
The crew appealed for help and the doctors stepped forward.
Afterwards, Professor Wallace confessed it had been the most unusual
operation he had yet performed.
Dr Brain Ellis, consultant surgeon at Ashford General Hospital, said
Mrs Dixon had been 15 minutes from death. He said: ''It would have been
unlikely to have got the plane on to the ground and got her to hospital
in time. I do not think Professor Wallace had an option but to say, 'I
need to save your life and I need to save it now'.''

AN industrial tribunal in Stornoway yesterday heard witnesses give
evidence in support of sacked Mod director Mr Donald Maclean.
Part-time college lecturer Frank Thompson, 64, said that once Mr
Maclean had found #200 in a drawer which had lain there unnoticed for
two years, then gave it towards a staff party, as had been originally
intended.
Another witness, teacher Iain Gordon Macdonald, 44, from Ness, Lewis
-- who steps down as an An Comunn management committee member in June --
said Mr Maclean had also bought jewellery for a historical exhibition.
He also said Mr Maclean had told him he intended to sell an old office
word processor and that Mr Maclean's family had offered #100 for it.
It was claimed that these incidents were used as grounds for Mr
Maclean's sacking.
Mr Maclean, 58, is claiming unfair dismissal from his former job as
national director of Royal National Mod organisers An Comunn
Gaidhealach.
The tribunal is expected to end today.

FORMER Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart pleaded not guilty
yesterday to brandishing a pickaxe and committing a breach of the peace
during an alleged confrontation with anti-motorway protestors near
Glasgow earlier this year.
Mr Stewart, 52, resigned as Scottish Industry Minister ''to save the
Government embarrassment'' after the alleged incident with protesters
against the M77 motorway extension.
In a letter to Paisley Sheriff Court, Mr Stewart, of Crofthead House,
Neilston, Renfrewshire, denied a charge that on February 5, in Stewarton
Road, Pollok Castle Estate, Newton Mearns, he did ''conduct yourself in
a disorderly manner, shout, repeatedly push about Lindsay Keenan (a
protester), c/o Pollok police office, brandish a pickaxe, and commit a
breach of the peace''.
Mr Stewart's son Jack, 17, who was 16 at the time of the alleged
incident, and a friend were with the MP at the time and both pleaded not
guilty through solicitor David Howat to two related charges.
Jack Stewart, of the same address as his father, pleaded not guilty to
possessing a loaded air weapon without lawful authority in public places
at Patterton railway station, at Stewarton Road in Pollok Castle Estate,
and at Giffnock police office in Braidholm Road, Giffnock, on February
5, contravening Section 19 of the Firearms Act of 1968.
He also denied a charge that he bought an air weapon while under the
age of 17 at a sports shop occupied by Victor Morris in Argyle Street,
Glasgow, on January 13, contravening Section 22 of the Firearms Act.
His friend, David Clow, 16, of Dumbarton Road, Scotstoun, in Glasgow,
also pleaded not guilty to the same charges.
A trial date for all three was set for September 11 at Paisley Sheriff
Court.
Six protesters against the M77 extension in Mr Stewart's Eastwood
constituency, including Mr Lindsay Keenan, 30, of George Street,
Paisley, mounted a picket outside Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday and
some witnessed the proceedings inside.

FOOTBALLER Paul Ince repeatedly denied attacking a spectator during a
match, a court was told yesterday.
The 27-year-old England midfielder, who captained Manchester United
during January's match against Crystal Palace, admitted he used to have
a ''reputation'' -- but said he had lived it down.
He told police he was ''gutted'' to have been dragged into the furore
which followed team-mate Eric Cantona's attack on another fan,
magistrates in Croydon, south London, were told.
He said: ''I haven't done nothing, you know.
''I've got a reputation before when I was 21 or 22, and it took me two
years to get rid of it. As a player I've matured, got a family, and all
that rubbish.''
While this part of his interview with officers was read to the court,
the player turned and grinned at his wife Clare, sitting feet away.
Ince, of Bramhall, Cheshire, denies a charge of assault by beating and
a second allegation of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or
behaviour.
Ince allegedly taunted home supporters at the match at Selhurst Park,
shouting: ''Come on then, we will take the f...... lot of you.''
Mr Jeffery McCann, prosecuting, claimed that, seconds later, the
player attacked Mr Dennis Warren, a Palace supporter.
The 48-year-old father-of-two suffered only a ''minor injury''.
Mr Warren, a dustman, of Anerley, south London, said he went to the
front of the stand following the Cantona incident.
He claimed: ''Mr Ince caught me on the end of the nose and I went
backwards and on to the floor. All I said was, 'You're a joke, and your
team's a joke'.''
Cross-examined by Mr Henri Brandman, for Ince, Mr Warren agreed he had
a number of convictions for threatening behaviour at football matches 20
years ago.
He also accepted that he was banned for three months by the Surrey
Football Association the season before last.
However, he rejected a suggestion by Mr Brandman that it was for
shouting in a Surrey league match: ''Get the nigger.''
He claimed he was banned for abusing the referee.
After watching TV footage of the melee, magistrates Michael Barnes,
Mrs Rosemary Rigden, and Mrs Maureen Nuttall heard from a series of
spectators and match stewards.
Mrs Adele Hardingham, a Palace season ticket holder, said Ince was
''flailing with his fists into the crowd''.
Mr Edward Barber, a steward at the ground, told the court: ''As we
were pushing people back, I saw Mr Ince strike out and hit a
spectator.''
Spectator Paul Jameson, a Football Association referee, said saw Ince
''lean over and appear to strike somebody'', who fell on to chairs and
steps.
United supporter Michael Darby said Ince taunted Palace fans but did
not throw a punch.
Ince said the only reason he ran off the pitch was because he thought
Cantona had been attacked by a fan after he was sent off.
Cantona was ordered to do 120 hours' community service after appealing
against a two-week jail term imposed for a charge of common assaultThe
trial continues today.

THE love affair between the Government and Rupert Murdoch's newspaper
empire appeared to cool last night as the Government published proposals
to free up the common ownership of newspapers and television -- but not
for large groups such as News International.
The proposals put forward in a consultative green paper would allow
newspaper groups to invest more money in the TV market and clear the way
for terrestrial broadcasters to expand into cable and satellite.
However, to stop domination by one or two large companies, there would
be thresholds which would appear to hamper only two companies -- Mr
Murdoch's News International, publishers of the Sun, Times, Sunday
Times, News of the World, and Today; and Mirror Group Newspapers,
publishers of the Mirror and Daily Record.
Most national newspaper groups would be able to own up to two ITV
companies with a maximum of 15% of the total television audience share,
while independent television companies could in turn buy greater stakes
in print.
However, only newspaper companies owning less than 20% of the national
newspaper circulation would be able to take advantage of the looser
expansion rules -- and that rules out News International and the Mirror
Group.
Both companies would have to sell off parts of their empire if they
wanted to benefit, and there were broad hints from News International
that it was considering such a drastic move.
The Government is suggesting that:
* Only newspaper groups which control under 20% of the national
newspaper market be allowed to expand, and control up to 15% of the
total television market.
* Newspapers below the 20% national circulation threshold be able to
apply for control of licences for national and local radio provided that
the company does not, as a result, control more than 30% of the media in
a local area.
* Broadcasting companies, although still limited to owning only up to
two regional ITV companies, be allowed to expand to up to 15% of total
television audience share.
* Terrestrial broadcasters be permitted to buy controlling interests
in satellite and cable companies as long as the combined total of their
interests does not exceed 15% of the national television audience share.
* Satellite and cable companies be able to have outright ownership of
Channel 3 or Channel 5 licenses provided they do not exceed 15% of the
total market or the two-licence limit.
* The circulation threshold under which newspaper groups can buy into
smaller papers without a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission be doubled from 25,000 to 50,000.
* No cross-control be allowed between newspaper and TV companies where
the newspaper's regional titles count for more than 30% of the regional
newspaper circulation in the relevant ITV area.
In the long term, the Government is aiming to limit single companies
from controlling more than 10% of the total UK media market or 20% of
any one regional market or media sector.
Ministers are not proposing an absolute ban on ownership above those
thresholds, but any proposal to breach the ceiling would be subject to
approval by an independent regulator.
The immediate effect is to throw into doubt any possibility of the
Mirror Group launching the long-rumoured takeover bid for Scottish
Television, where it holds 20% of the shares.
Scottish Television's share price fell yesterday as speculators
realised that, with no imminent takeover, the chances of a quick profit
had decreased.
Unveiling his consultation paper, Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell
said one of his aims was to stop media domination by individual
companies, but denied his intention was to stop Mr Murdoch.
''I don't think it's right to develop public policy with your eyes too
firmly set on a single company or personality,'' he said.
The measures are unlikely to come into operation before January 1997.
The proposals were given a mixed response in the Commons after Mr
Dorrell announced his plans.
Two Labour MPs -- Mr Tony Worthington (Clydebank and Milngavie) and Mr
Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow) -- raised questions about the impact on
Scotland, but Mr Dorrell swept their concerns aside.
Mr Worthington asked: ''Can you tell us what there is in there (the
Government document) that will stimulate good quality programme-making
in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and the regions of England?''
Mr Dorrell replied: ''The key issue of quality is always served by
ensuring that those responsible for media activity are healthy
businesses. The interests of quality are not served by artificial
constraints on business. It is all about the conditions on which the
licence is granted.''
Mr Dalyell referred to the ''genuine concern'' in Scotland over the
Government's plans, and asked: ''Should not national newspaper sales be
taken into account when assessing suitability for assessing regional
radio and TV franchises?''
Mr Dorrell replied: ''That is exactly what I propose. That national
circulation should limit the group operators who can invest in Channel 3
and Channel 5 licences. I think we are going in the same direction.''

LABOUR yesterday called on the National Lottery regulator to force
Camelot to reveal how much profit it was making.
The call, by shadow heritage spokesman Chris Smith, came amid
speculation that the lottery operator could be making #1m a week in
profits.
Mr Smith said the watchdog, the Office of the National Lottery
(Oflot), should insist on Camelot giving monthly details of what it
spends and what it keeps.
He added that the Government would be wise to review the formula which
decides how money from the lottery is divided, to ensure the maximum
possible is going to good causes.
''Oflot should insist on Camelot issuing figures month by month,'' he
said.
When it became lottery operator last year, Camelot said it would keep,
on average, 5% of the money raised by the game for operating costs and
profits over the seven years of its licence.
However, Mr Smith claimed that Camelot officials had admitted to him
that the consortium -- made up of Cadbury Schweppes, Racal Electronics,
International Computers Ltd, De La Rue, and Gtech UK Ltd -- was
currently taking 9%.
Oflot, for its part, said it had no plans to impose any new curbs on
Camelot. A spokesman said division of the lottery money was controlled
by a formula agreed between Oflot and Camelot. That formula allowed
Camelot to vary the percentage up or down, providing the figure averaged
5% over seven years.

Iain Wilson reports on a Glasgow University study
which resurrects the image of the struggling artist
THERE may be no business like show business but other myths are well
and truly shattered by the Glasgow University socio-economic study of
artists in Scotland.
The research, for the Scottish Arts Council, reveals that rewards for
artistic endeavour are often miserly at best, although 0.2% of artists
can expect an income of more than #100,000 a year.
One in five artists -- writers, dancers, actors, musicians, opera
singers, and visual artists -- receive less than #5000 a year; almost
half earn below #10,000, and only 6% receive #30,000 or more.
Unemployment is also a common experience. Nearly a third have
experienced a spell of registered unemployment last year, rising to 45%
over the last five years.
Being out of work is endemic in the acting profession, with 67%
unemployed in the last year, rising to 79% over a five- year period.
In broad terms, however, they are happier than any other group of
performers -- accustomed to the irregularity of employment and income
which typifies the sector. They are also the highest paid when they get
work. Lucrative ancillary activities, from long-term advertising
contracts to after-dinner engagements, can provide up to 50% of the
highest earners' income.
The profile of dancers was the bleakest of all -- with interviewees
complaining of a complete lack of interest in dance in Scotland. The
availability of training was said to be nil.
Dancers, from Scottish Ballet to small contemporary dance companies or
freelances, were the artists' group least satisfied with Scottish Art
Council's support for their activities.
They blamed low morale on inadequate funding from the SAC -- and poor
pay rates in a career which lasts only a few years in most cases.
One told the research team: ''Scottish Ballet simply does not get
enough funding. Compared to the opera, the funding and facilities we
have to put up with are ridiculous . . .''
It was argued Scottish Ballet had done one show in London in 15 years
whereas all the English companies get to come north with funding from
the British Arts Council. Scottish dancers claimed to be leaving in
droves because of the failure to support creativity and underfunding.
Musicians' morale was also fairly low. Among classical musicians, the
reasons cited included the lack of artistic control or value in large
organisations and the proposed merger between Scottish Opera and the BBC
Scottish Symphony Orchestra.
Their wider concerns about the future of music in Scotland added to
poor morale. Many pointed to a growing problem of underfunding at school
level.
Opera singers complained that Scottish Opera, the only employer in
Scotland, was ''grossly underfunded'' when compared with other companies
in Britain. Their main concern was the level of grant to the company and
Government policies which ''threatened overall funding for the arts''.
Around 40% rated SAC support as poor and warned that some of the best
singers in the country, if not Europe, had to go to London or abroad for
work.
The study found that artists had identified a need for more direct
financial support throughout their careers. Other needs included raising
their economic status to wanting a more flexible funding system that
would allow small grants to be made more quickly.
Artists sought collective resources in the major cities, including
susidised rehearsal space and access to training, information, and
advice. They also called for national and regional actors and dancers'
centres, a writers' retreat, and help in developing international
contacts to raise the profile of Scottish art in Britain and abroad.
One in three rated SAC support for the arts as poor, while two-thirds
said it was good or adequate.

THE last two Greenpece protesters finally gave up last night after
spending nearly 16 hours perched high above the helideck on Brent Spar.
They had been told at first by their ringleader Jon Castle, as he was
taken off by security men, that they should stay put.
But police spoke to Mr Castle when he was taken aboard the Stadive and
urged him to call down his last two colleagues on humanitarian grounds
because of the danger and the risk of exposure they were facing.
He agreed, and was taken up on the deck of the Stadive and shouted out
across to them: ''Come down.''
Both scrambled wearily down from their perches and transferred across
to the Stadive, leaving only their tattered Greenpeace flag behind.
Police Commander David Beattie said afterwards: ''We have no reason to
believe there is anyone else hiding on there. It appears to be all
over.''
Brent Spar was hijacked in protest at plans to dump the redundant oil
installation in the Atlantic.
However, sheriff officers at first failed to find Mr Castle, ''Captain
Greenpeace'', the only man against whom Shell has an interdict.
Safety concerns prevented the oil company from a quick search of all
areas of the facility. It feared there could be toxic gases in some
areas.
The dangers on the Brent Spar were highlighted in 1977 when three
workers died after being overcome by hydrogen sulphide while working on
a low deck.
After an abortive bid to board from the multi-purpose vessel Stadive
on Monday, Shell's successful raid started at 6am yesterday.
A metal basket slung from a crane on Stadive was swung across to the
helideck of the Brent Spar. In spite of attempts by some of the
activists to impede the lowering of the personnel basket and push it
away, 15 men -- including six Grampian Police officers, sheriff
officers, and Shell staff -- were able to board.
The Greenpeace protesters then scattered, some deep inside the
platform and some up a crane beside the helideck. Some set off smoke
canisters as they headed into the accommodation area.
With the offshore installation manager, Mr Diarmid MacAllister-Hall,
on board, Shell was able to order Greenpeace activists and seven
journalists off the Brent Spar under the 1971 Offshore Workings Act.
Shell said the eviction involved no excessive use of force, although
some activists did offer passive resistance.
None of those removed has been charged with any criminal offence.
Shell said the occupation had highlighted a loophole in the law which it
plans to discuss with the Department of Trade.
Shell's production director, Mr Dick Parker, said: ''The police were
unable to follow a criminal procedures process because the law didn't
work in that direction and I think it poses some questions for offshore
legislation. We were left to pursue the civil option. We have not
enjoyed the adverse publicity, but we have tried to take a measured
approach to the whole problem.
''It has opened up a loophole in the law. We have many many more
unmanned facilities in our operation and one has to think now about the
safety and integrity of those, viz a viz anyone who might try to get on
them.''
He added that Shell at no time had any intention of risking injury by
attempting to remove the protesters on the crane.
Mr Parker denied claims by some of the activists that the eviction had
been heavy handed, adding: ''I don't think it could have been done in a
more controlled manner.
''I would like to acknowledge the exceptional support we have had from
Grampian Police and the sheriff officers in preparing this programme.
The police have tried to find every opportunity to talk to the
Greenpeace people to try to get them to understand the situation.''
Mr Heinz Rothermund, Shell's managing director, said Greenpeace and
other organisations pointed to problems and Shell respected that. Many
things were being done world-wide thanks to the fact that problems had
been pointed out, but as industrial organisations they were paid to find
solutions and compromise and evaluations were required.
Greenpeace said its campaign would not end with the removal of all the
protesters. It has already spent #75,000 on the operation to highlight
the Brent Spar issue.
''It is only three weeks until the North Sea Ministers' meeting where
the UK Government is going to have to face the wrath of its
neighbours,'' said protester Jan Rispens.
''Shell knows it cannot remove all the toxic waste from the Spar while
it is at sea -- in fact it doesn't even have a proper picture of exactly
what waste is in the Brent Spar.
''Shell is trying to appear responsible to the public whilst carrying
out one of the most irresponsible acts of environmental vandalism we
have seen for years.''
At the same time as Shell was boarding the installation, Greenpeace
was staging another demonstration -- blocking the entrances of the Shell
International building in The Hague.

THE former soldiers who lay injured and dying amid the wreckage of
their coach maintained an ''almost deathly calm'' during the huge rescue
operation lasting more than three hours, said a fire officer at the
scene.
The sight which met more than 100 emergency service workers was
''horrendous'', said Station Officer John Dando of Avon Fire Brigade.
Some of the injured veterans had been able to scramble out of the
upturned and collapsed wreckage, covered in blood from severe cuts, but
others were still trapped inside, he said.
''Despite the seriousness of some of the injuries, there was no
screaming and shouting. There was an almost deathly calm. People were
suffering from shock.''
Nearly 50 firefighters were on the scene and crews were soon using
cutting gear to get inside the coach and free those trapped, said Mr
Dando.
''But six people, some of whom were clearly mortally wounded, were
trapped for nearly three hours -- we just couldn't get them out any
quicker.
''The coach was extremely unstable. It had overturned down an
embankment and was on its roof over a drainage culvert.
''It was physically impossible to get to six people, and there was
also a real risk that the coach could have turned over again at any
moment.''
Hydraulic gear and air bags were used to prop up the coach and later a
crane was used to lift it to enable rescue workers to get underneath to
reach those still trapped.
Paramedics were able to get close enough to give pain-killing drugs to
some of those trapped as the operation went on, said Mr Dando.
The dead and worst injured did not seem to be from any particular part
of the coach, he said.
''I think everyone on board was injured to some extent. But one of the
strangest things is how it happened in the first place.
''There is no indication that any other vehicle was involved and the
coach went off the road on a straight stretch of the motorway.''

THE crash is the latest in a series of fatal road accidents involving
coaches and minibuses. Pressure to make seat belts on coaches compulsory
has increased.
The issue reached prominence when the faces of 12 schoolchildren,
killed in the M40 minibus crash, stared out from the front pages in
November 1993.
Their vehicle crashed into the back of a maintenance truck. At the
inquest, the coroner said they would have stood a better chance of
survival if they had been wearing seat belts.
* November 1993: Ten American tourists and their British driver are
killed when their coach careers off the M2 in Kent. They were not
wearing seat belts.
* February 1994: Two Biggar schoolboys are killed after a collision
between a school bus and a lorry on the B7016.
* May 15, 1994: Two eight-year-old cub scouts and a 42-year-old man
are killed when a minibus collides with a coach carrying Army cadets on
the A59 between York and Harrogate. Campaigners again call for seat
belts to be compulsory in minibuses.
* August 29, 1994: A teenage girl dies when a minibus crashed on the
M6 in Staffordshire. Rescuers said the other passengers were saved by
their seat belts.
* September 18, 1994: Three Girl Guides and two of their leaders die
when a bus collides with low bridge in West Street, Glasgow. The driver,
Mr Campbell Devlin, was later cleared of causing their deaths.
* March 28, 1995: European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock unveils
plans for the compulsory fitting of seat belts in all new coaches and
minibuses.
Some of the questions investigators into the latest crash will be
seeking to answer are:
* What was the condition of the coach? Had the coach been properly
maintained, or was there some sort of unforeseen mechanical failure such
as a burst tyre?
* What were road conditions? The weather was generally fine but there
may have been heavy traffic. Although no other vehicle was damaged in
the accident, could the coach have got into difficulties because of the
action of another road user?
* Was the driver momentarily distracted just before the crash?
Investigators will want to talk to the injured driver to establish the
events immediately leading up to the tragedy.
* Could the incident be on film? Investigators may have a complete
picture of the accident from surveillance cameras.
* Were the safety barriers adequate? A witness reported that the coach
seemed to have crashed through a wooden fence.
* Could seat belts have prevented some deaths and injuries? A study of
the injuries to passengers might establish if seat belts might have
helped.

<RECORDNO>978239767</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government is facing fresh demands to bring in immediately coach
safety laws after yesterday's West Country crash.
Once again, the calls centre on the fitting of seatbelts but the age
and variety of the UK coach fleet makes this difficult.
The Confederation of Passenger Transport UK currently urges its member
coach companies to fit belts on new vehicles.
However, it believes there are serious practical difficulties in
forcing older vehicles to be fitted with belts.
''We doubt very much if they can be safely fitted to pre-1988
vehicles,'' a CPT spokesman said.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said: ''A detailed inquiry
into this dreadful tragedy is urgently required. We must look carefully
at the hours of work required of the driver concerned and at the
roadworthiness of the coach.
''In addition, Labour has long argued for compulsory car-type safety
belts to be fitted in every coach and minibus.''
He stressed: ''If fitted safety belts could have saved lives in this
latest case, there can be no excuse for further delay.''
Two accidents in late 1993 sparked the call for a tightening of coach
and minibus safety -- 10 people died in a coach crash near Faversham,
Kent, and 12 schoolchildren and their teacher were killed in a minibus
crash on the M40 in the west Midlands.
The school minibus disaster finally prompted action. In July 1994, the
then Transport Secretary John MacGregor announced a package of proposals
to improve coach and minibus safety.
He said the UK would seek agreement to have seatbelts fitted to all
buses and coaches specifically used for transporting children.
This measure was proposed formally by the current Transport Secretary,
Dr Brian Mawhinney, in March this year.
Both the UK Government and new EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock
are keen to make it compulsory to have all new coaches and minibuses
fitted with seatbelts.
The UK would like to see this ruling brought in by the end of the
year.
At present, there are two types of seatbelt available -- the lap strap
(as used on planes), and the three-point belt (as used in cars).
The lap strap is easy to instal and operates by restraining the lower
half of the body in the seat.
The three-point belts are thought to give the best protection but the
problem is where to fix them.
Substantial reinforcement of the seats, fixing, and floors is
necessary for some three-point belts to the effective. However, this
could seriously affect the vehicle's centre of gravity and could raise
the possibility of a roll-over.
At present, just the driver and a coach courier -- when travelling in
the seat next to the driver -- are required to wear belts on coaches.

SCIENTISTS in Scotland are preparing to begin trials of a
revolutionary cancer treatment which uses a virus to attack tumours
while leaving healthy cells intact.
The virus, genetically engineered in the laboratory, will be used on
people with head and neck tumours. They account for about 5% of all
cancers cases.
Professor Allan Balmain, director of laboratory research at Glasgow
University's medical oncology department, said yesterday: ''There is a
limit to what chemotherapy and radiotherapy can do for these patients,
particularly if they have a recurrence. Oral cancer tends to be
particularly resistant to therapy.''
Professor Balmain and his team, based at the Cancer Research Campaign
Beatson Laboratories in Bearsden, are awaiting ethical clearance to
begin patient-trials with the virus, which has been developed in
collaboration with a company in California. They hope to recruit the
first patients later this year.
Cancer of the oesophagus is increasing -- 739 deaths in Scotland in
1993 compared with 416 just 20 years ago.
''In the US they are among the fasting rising tumours and are rising
predominantly among youngish white males, and they are rising
exponentially,'' said Professor Balmain.
''It looks as if there is some aetiological agent that would date from
the 1950s onward, something that young whites had access to that black
children at the time couldn't afford. Speculation has included soft
drinks.''
The campaign will shortly launch a corporate appeal to fund a #1.5m
gene therapy laboratory in the Beatson complex, to bring forward the
kind of work Professor Balmain described.
The virus used is an adeno-virus, which commonly causes respiratory
illness. Normally it invades healthy cells, which try to kill it using a
protein called p53, which also has the function of ensuring that cells
die when they are supposed to, instead of becoming cancerous. Cancer
cells do not have p53, and so succumb to the virus.
The Phase I trial will involve around 30 patients in the advance
stages of cancer, and will test the therapy for side-effects.
The Phase II trial will be designed more closely towards successful
treatment. Two Scottish specialist companies are being considered to
manufacture the mutant virus.

A WILD West gunslingers' display left a fast-draw champion blind in
one eye after he tangled with ''Desperate Dan'', the High Court in
Edinburgh was told yesterday.
Mr William MacGregor, 41, also known as Wishbone, and his former wife
Miss Lorraine Parker, 32, whose nickname was Hellcat, told the court
they were attacked on the way home from a night out.
The couple said they first met Mr John McMillan, 27, also known as
Desperate Dan, at a Country and Western night in the city's Clermiston
Inn, on March 13, 1993.
The court was told that, during the evening, Mr MacGregor and Mr
William Reid, 51, nicknamed Oilcan Wullie, had put on a shooting
exhibition. Using blanks, they burst balloons held by women by shooting
at them with their guns.
Mr McMillan had wanted to take part in the shoot-out and was ''not
very happy'' when he was refused.
Mr McMillan, of Wester Hailes Park, Edinburgh, has denied assaulting
Mr MacGregor, c/o the police, by attempting to gouge out his eye to his
severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
He has also denied attacking Miss Parker.
Mr MacGregor, the East of Scotland fast-draw champion, who is now
divorced from Miss Parker, told the court that trouble flared during the
course of the evening and he had tried to calm things down with Mr
McMillan.
He said that as he and his former wife made their way out to their car
Mr McMillan made a lunge at Miss Parker, he intervened, but was then
attacked himself.
He said Mr McMillan went first for his left eye, but then went for the
right one. ''He then actually gouged at my right eye,'' he said, adding
that he told Miss Parker: ''He has blinded me.''
Mr MacGregor said he spent 14 days in hospital after the attack, and
has lost the sight of his right eye.
McMillan denied that he had caused trouble. He said he could not
account for the injury to Mr MacGregor, and did not touch Miss Parker.
The trial before Lord Johnston continues.

THE M4 tragedy comes two weeks after the Government was warned that
further delay in forcing operators to fit seat belts in coaches and
minibuses could have ''deadly consequences for passengers''.
Consumers' Association director, Mrs Sheila McKechnie, wrote to
Transport Minister Steven Norris on May 9 urging him to act quickly to
protect passengers.
She said the European Commission was dragging its heels in bringing in
legislation and called on the Government to take unilateral action.
''The latest research shows that car-style three-point belts are the
only safe solution for minibuses, while two-point lap belts are an
acceptable option on coaches,'' said Ms McKechnie.
''But, after pressure from Italy, France, and Germany, the Commission
now looks set to introduce a compromise solution which would deny
passengers the best possible protection.
''Any compromise solution is totally unacceptable. For the sake of
passenger safety, three-point seat belts must be made compulsory in all
new minibuses urgently.
''If the EC wants to water down proposed measures then the UK
Government has a duty to take unilateral action to ensure British
passengers are protected.''
The CA has been campaigning for compulsory seatbelts in coaches and
minibuses for more than a decade.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said it would urge
the Government to make it compulsory for seatbelts to be fitted to all
coaches and minibuses.
A spokesperson said: ''Lapbelts could be easily fitted to the vast
majority of coaches and would greatly reduce the number of serious
incidents. As it is, there are very, very few coaches with belts
fitted.''
The Confederation of Passenger Transport UK (formerly the Bus and
Coach Council) said a number of its major members were already fitting
seatbelts into new coaches.
However, a confederation spokesman added: ''We doubt very much that
retrospective fitting would be appropriate for many pre-1988 coaches.''
He added: ''We recommend that new coaches should have three-point
belts. We're certainly not against belts.''

EUROPEAN safety laws for coaches which could have saved lives in
yesterday's tragedy are on the way but not until next year at the
earliest.
The measures were announced earlier this year by the new Transport
Commissioner in Brussels, Mr Neil Kinnock, and he called for British
support to cut the death and injury toll on the roads.
Mr Kinnock's first concrete proposal for legislation since taking
office focused on seatbelts in coaches and minibuses and they go further
than the Government's latest moves to introduce compulsory seatbelts on
all school minibuses and coaches.
If member states back Mr Kinnock's plans, all coaches above 3.5 tonnes
will have to be fitted with lap belts on all seats. Minibuses would be
required to fit full three-point belts on forward facing seats.
The EU directive would apply to all new coaches and not just those
used for school transport, at Mr Kinnock's insistence. He told a road
safety conference in Glasgow earlier this year that it was vital all
coach passengers should benefit from the increased protection offered by
seat belts.
The commissioner would like the legislation in force by next year and
added: ''I trust that we will be able to count upon the UK's support.
Implementation of these changes, without question, saves lives and
prevents or reduces injuries. Any procedural, political, or commercial
resistance to the proposals must, because of that fundamental point
alone, be overcome.''
The UK's 80,000 coaches are subject to stringent and frequent safety
checks and drivers have to pass an increasing number of medical tests as
they get older.
To operate a coach, drivers have to be at least 21 and have a
passenger vehicle licence as well as an ordinary driving licence. This
PSV licence is valid until drivers reach the age of 45, after which it
has to be renewed every five years. Once drivers reach 65, the licence
has to be renewed annually. Each of these renewals is dependent on a
medical report.
Unlike cars which have no MoT tests until they are three years old,
coaches have their first MoT when they are one year old. The tests are
tougher than they are for cars, with as many as 500 items being checked.

A UNION flag was raised and kept at half mast outside the British
Legion building in Christchurch last night, as a mark of respect for the
dead.
A steady procession of friends and relatives of those on the fateful
day-trip made their way to the grey pebble-dashed building, desperate
for news of their loved ones.
Veteran Mr Percy Pitman, 75, among those gathered at the building,
said: ''It's absolutely terrible. Everyone is totally shocked. Some of
my friends were probably on the trip but I don't know for certain. I
won't know until I have been inside and found out.''
At the London Headquarters of the Royal British Legion, Secretary
General Lieutenant Colonel Philip Creasy described the accident as
''appalling''.
He said: ''This tragedy will certainly be felt, not just by the
families and friends but by the people of Christchurch as a whole and by
the Royal British Legion nationwide.''
Christchurch Mayor Edward Coope, who was in his last day of office
yesterday, said: ''At the moment, everyone is devastated. We are going
to try to co-ordinate things to see what the council can do.''
Leaders of Dorset County Council expressed their horror at the
''dreadful'' accident. Council leader, Dr Geoffery Tapper, himself a
member of the Royal British Legion, said: ''My sympathy goes to the
families and relatives of all those involved.''

THE mangled wreckage of the coach involved in a crash which claimed 10
lives was towed away last night.
The accident happened at possibly the worst spot along a section of
the motorway for the coach to have left the carriageway.
It had ploughed nose first upside down with its elderly passengers
into a knee-deep concrete culvert beside the M4.
The impact crushed the roof and a police spokesman said two of those
who died had drowned when they plunged head first into the drainage
ditch.
As a recovery truck hauled away the twisted remains of the silver,
blue and red coloured vehicle at 9.15pm last night -- five hours after
the crash -- rescue workers continued the painstaking task of retrieving
belongings.
Several fire officers clambered down a ladder from the embankment and
waded into the gulley, raking through the grimy cocktail of diesel and
water.
First a man's jacket surfaced, then another nearby.
A man's black-leather shoe floated on top of the murky water. A
firefighter retrieved it while another found the other shoe in the
opening of a pipe leading under the motorway into the culvert.
A woman's white-leather sandal, a black shoulder bag, a camera, a
man's tie and umbrella were also salvaged. A plum, part of one
traveller's snack for the long journey from Cardiff back to
Christchurch, floated forlornly on the water.
A large number of local sightseers had watched the rescue operation
unfold from what became an impromptu car park by the side of a minor
road a few hundred yards from the crash site.
A retired prison officer from Bristol, admitted he had come to the
scene out of ''inquisitiveness''.
His wife, a doctor's receptionist was peering through binoculars at
the crumpled debris as it was craned up the embankment on to the hard
shoulder.
A video camera sat on the front seat of their Ford Escort.
The woman said: ''How any one came out of there alive is unbelievable.
''It's devastating for their families and you can't help thinking
'there but for the grace of God . . . '.''
She added: ''It's so sad when you think they fought through and
survived the war to lose their lives like this.''
Half a mile away the eastward tower of the Severn Bridge cut a
reassuringly solid backdrop as the sun set.
Fire brigade spokesman Mr John Dando reflected the views of many of
the rescue workers when he described the scene when he first arrived as
''pure carnage''.
Chief Inspector Jeff Bromage of Avon traffic police said: ''In all my
33 years in this job this is the worst single vehicle accident I have
encountered.''
As darkness drew in, at the Royal British Legion in Christchurch the
Union flag hung at half mast as anxious visitors came and went, one
woman leaving in tears, while police officers stood outside.
The British Legion provided welfare staff to help cope with distressed
relatives and cars were made available to pick up people from Bristol
who were well enough to travel.
Mr Michael Pierce, mayor of Christchurch, was celebrating his first
day in office when news of the crash broke.
''It's tragic news, a lot of the members of the British Legion are
very much personal friends. It's a close-knit community and the town
this evening is saddened and shocked by the news,'' he said.
Mrs Irene Hopkins, 77, told how she and her husband Howard, had been
due to go on the trip but had changed their minds at the last moment.
''We have just been away for two weeks and we felt it would be a very
tiring day out so we decided not to go at the last minute,'' said Mrs
Hopkins.
''I can't believe this has happened. It would have been a full coach
except for the two empty seats we had booked.''
Mr Brian Gwynne, 58, who operates Laguna Travel, which has two
coaches, said: ''I was stunned when a policeman arrived at my door to
break this terrible news. Our coaches have never been involved in an
accident before. As a coach owner it's the sort of experience you hope
you will never have to go through.''

THE second round of the bitter takeover battle for control of
Britain's warship construction industry is due to start immediately
after defence electronics giant GEC yesterday received the green light
to bid for Trident submarine builder VSEL.
Board of Trade President Michael Heseltine overturned a Monopolies and
Mergers Commission ruling that GEC, which already owns Yarrow
Shipbuilders on the Clyde, should have its bid for the rival Cumbrian
yard blocked.
Now both GEC and British Aerospace are set for a shares fight which
could eventually decide the ownership of the bulk of the UK's defence
electronics, military aircraft and naval shipbuilding industries.
The other fear is that if GEC is successful, it will be forced to
rationalise its warship-building operations. Thousands of jobs at
Yarrow, which is currently the leading British yard for Type 23
frigates, and VSEL, front-runner for a new contract for up to five
Trafalgar-class nuclear patrol submarines and two assault ships, are at
stake.
The UK's only other warship builder, Vosper-Thorneycroft, specialises
in smaller naval craft such as fast patrol boats.
BAe fired the first shot in the battle last year, but when GEC entered
the contest, the issue was put on hold until the MMC could investigate
the implications and give its recommendations to Mr Heseltine.
It ruled that the BAe bid would not operate ''against the public
interest'', but that GEC's takeover attempt should be blocked because of
its ownership of Yarrow and the potential for restricting Defence
Ministry choice of contractors in future naval orders.
Mr Heseltine said yesterday that he accepted the MMC's findings on
BAe, but rejected its majority view that GEC should not be allowed to
bid.
BAe wants VSEL to help diversify its existing aircraft and electronics
interests, but is at risk of being outgunned financially by GEC, whose
net cash holdings exceed #1000m. BAe's entire net worth is valued at
#876m.
The immediate prize is control of a group with potential submarine and
surface warship orders worth #3000m. But the wider implication is Mr
Heseltine's apparent tacit approval for a longer-term merger of the two
companies' complete defence interests.
City analysts yesterday believed that rejection of the MMC's
objections to GEC had paved the way for a takeover of BAe in the
interest of gaining a consolidated share of Britain's shrinking defence
budget and creating a platform for expansion of defence export business
in Europe.
A GEC spokesman said the company welcomed the opportunity to allow
''financial market forces'' to come into play. He declined to comment on
possible job reductions at either VSEL or Yarrow.
Scots MPs on both sides of the Commons voiced concern about the impact
of a GEC takeover of VSEL on the Yarrow yard and Jetstream aircraft
production at Prestwick.
Mr Tony Worthington (Clydebank and Milngavie -- Labour) asked what
assurances the Government had been given about the future of Yarrow if
the GEC bid was successful.
Mr Heseltine said GEC chairman Lord Weinstock had given an assurance
to the Defence Ministry that if GEC won the competition to build the new
Type 23 frigates, they would be built at Yarrow.
But Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr -- Conservative) expressed doubts if real
competition could exist within a company which owned two shipyards.
Afterwards Mr Brian Donohoe (Cunninghame North -- Labour) said that if
GEC did win he forecast a merger with British Aerospace within five
years which could be bad news for the workforce at Jetstream.

THE European Commission is investigating possible Scottish Office
misuse of regional aid from Brussels after accusations that it spent
#93m helping to fatten public utilities for privatisation.
The Commissioner for regional policy, Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, told
the European Parliament last night that she wanted to know more about
how the money was spent over a four-year period on British Telecom,
electricity and gas industries, airports, shipping ports, and buses.
Her investigation comes after a similar inquiry ordered by Mr Bruce
Millan, her predecessor. His last act as a Commissioner was to inquire
into how #3m of European funding was used in the privatisation of
ClydePort and how other money was used in the sale of assets in four new
towns. The Scottish Office and ClydePort denied misusing the money.
Under EU rules, it is illegal to use regional funding simply to fatten
public utilities for sale.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies said the Commission could demand repayment if it was
proved, as Labour Euro-MPS claim, that the money had been grossly
misused. Public benefit from the results of privatisations also had to
be considered, along with whether the result of using the money for
privatisations gave a commercial advantage to one party, breaching
competition policy.
She was aware that Mr Millan had left Brussels with worries about how
such money had been spent in Scotland but she said she had not discussed
the issue with him.
She said other countries were also being investigated but she did not
name them. She told Euro-MPs that it was ''quite clearly not an EU
policy'' simply to use structural funding for privatising public
infrastructure.
''EU funds are not intended for making enormous profits for privatised
companies,'' she said.

THE Scottish Arts Council was accused yesterday of secretly sanitising
an academic study it commissioned after the findings revealed a
widespread condemnation of its performance.
Members of the Glasgow University research team are said to be so
unhappy with the edited version for public release that some have
dissociated themselves from it.
The five-strong team, in a summary, had found that artists perceived
the SAC as bureaucratic, too secretive in its decision making, and not
responsive to those it is supposed to represent.
It added that many artists -- including writers, dancers, actors, and
musicians -- also thought the SAC adopted ''a too subordinate role in
dealings with central Government''.
Interviewees also complained that the SAC concentrated on
administering funds handed down by Government -- rather than being
advocates for the arts, and making sustained, well-publicised cases for
increased funding.
These criticisms, and others -- including the attitude of Government
to the arts, and ''inadequate'' funding for the SAC -- are effectively
missing from the published report.
One sociologist close to the independent research team described the
Socio-Economic Study of Artists in Scotland, as published, as ''a
travesty'' and added: ''It is not like the original report it was based
on.''
Mr Drew McFarlane, Scottish organiser of the actors' union Equity,
claimed the differences between the original and published findings are
blatant, with most criticisms and political points removed.
He added the controversy will only heighten public perceptions that
the SAC, which distributes #20m worth of Government funds to the arts,
is secretive and incapable of accepting criticisms in any shape or form.
SAC depute director, Ms Christine Hamilton, strenuously denied
allegations of a cover-up or that the findings had been doctored to
present the quango in a better light.
Ms Hamilton was adamant that any deletions were mainly down to the
research team exceeding its brief or to the cutting of ''muddle.''
However, there is no doubting the university team spent weeks in
negotiations with the SAC after insisting the report could not be
described as its own, because data had been removed.
Agreement was finally reached on a form of words for the published
title: A Scottish Arts Council report based on original research by the
Departments of Sociology and Social and Economic Research, University of
Glasgow.
The report, which cost at least #18,000, had four main objectives.
They ranged from discovering artists' earnings and conditions of work to
establishing what they thought of SAC schemes of support.
One aim was to define key problems facing artists which may cause them
to reduce or cease their activities.
Ms Hamilton denied that the brief opened the study to political
issues, including artists' criticisms of the Government or SAC failures
to press for more public money.
Mr McFarlane said Equity will demand to know why the SAC, a
State-funded body, has not published the full findings of a study which
was met out of public funds.
He added: ''The SAC should make the report available in original form
and not this sanitised version that contains little of the criticisms of
issues that stem from this quango.''
The Federation of Entertainment Unions, which embraces musicians,
broadcasters, writers, and other entertainers, is also expected to make
representations.
Labour's Scottish arts spokesman Maria Fyfe said she would be
interested to see both the university and SAC's versions of the report,
and added: ''I will be asking the SAC what conclusions it has drawn up
from the study.''
Ms Hamilton said of the edited product: ''I deny it was sanitised. It
was to create sanity from what was a fundamentally good piece of
research from what was a lot of muddle.''
She said the SAC was clearly arguing the case for funds, having
achieved a near 3% increase this year.

TEN pensioners were killed yesterday when a coach carrying Royal
British Legion veterans on a day trip to a brewery plunged off a
motorway and overturned. A fire brigade spokesman said two of the
victims had drowned in the 4ft of water running alongside the motorway.
The driver was among 20 others injured, one critically, in the
accident on the M4 near Bristol. Several elderly victims were in a
serious condition. The cause of the accident was unclear.
The single-decker coach apparently careered off the motorway to scrape
along 400-yards of wooden boundary fence before crashing through and
tumbling onto its roof in a water-filled culvert.Many of the passengers
were trapped upside down.
Station Officer John Dando of Avon Fire Brigade said: ''When I arrived
I saw a number of walking wounded. There were 22 people still trapped
inside, but the driver and seven others had managed to get out.
''Firefighters and paramedics who went to the vehicle initially, put
themselves at extreme personal risk. The way the coach had crashed, it
was still very unstable. There was a possibility that it would tilt,
crushing rescuers and those waiting to be rescued.''
Fire crews placed special inflatable lifting gear alongside the coach
to stabilise it while the rescue continued.
Assistant divisional officer John Waft was the first senior fire
officer on the scene. As soon as he saw the mangled wreckage he called
for five more crews, two rescue tenders and a mobile crane.
Fire crew had to wade in 4ft of oily water to attempt an entry to the
front end of the coach where people were trapped in their seats.
He said: ''It was more like a battlefield that a coach which had gone
off the motorway.''
He said that a lot of the victims had been thrown violently forward
when the coach struck the culvert.
Rescuers cut an 18-inch gap in the front of the coach and used it to
pull clear the injured and dead, he said.
''It was a miracle anyone came out alive.''
The head of Avon and Somerset police traffic department, Chief
Inspector Jeff Brommage, said: ''This is probably the worst single
vehicle accident I have attended in 33 years' service.''
More than two dozen police officers were at the scene and some would
possibily require counselling after witnessing the harrowing scenes
involving the coach party.
The police chaplain who helped the injured and counselled some
paramedics is a local vicar at Pilning. He is the police chaplain at the
Almondesbury motorway control centre which oversees the massive
interchange and motorway routes close by.
The chaplain operated close to the crash scene which had been cordoned
off by a green tarpaulin.
Firemen used ladders to bring the injured and dead from the ditch to a
green and white inflatable tent erected nearby. The tent acted as
emergency medical centre and temporary mortuary.
Mr Waft said: ''Four bodies had to be cut from their seatbelts and
were hanging upside down in the wreckage. The driver is thought to have
been thrown clear and he was able to assist firefighters by telling them
how many people were on board and where they were sitting.''
Avon and Somerset Police confirmed last night that the driver was
given a breath-test which proved negative. A spokesman said: ''This is
normal standard practice.''
Rescuers from the emergency services battled for more than three hours
to free victims trapped in the wreckage.
The tragedy immediately rekindled controversy over the safety of
coaches. Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney called for an urgent report
into the crash.
The pensioners were all from the Legion's Christchurch branch in
Dorset, one of the largest in the country with a membership of more than
2000.
They had been on a day-trip to a Bass brewery in Cardiff and were
returning to Christchurch when the accident happened.
The nine-year-old coach was owned by Laguna Coaches of Bournemouth.
More than 100 emergency workers fought to free veterans from the
wreckage.
The former soldiers who lay injured and dying amid the twisted
wreckage of their coach maintained an ''almost deathly calm'' during the
huge rescue operation, said Station Officer Dando.
''It was sheer carnage, there is no other way of describing it.''
Some of the injured veterans had been able to scramble out of the
upturned and collapsed wreckage, covered in blood from severe cuts, but
others were trapped inside, he said.
''Despite the seriousness of some of the injuries, there was no
screaming and shouting. There was an almost deathly calm. People were
suffering from shock.
''Unfortunately we are used to dealing with major accident scenes, but
this one was horrendous for firefighters and paramedics,'' he said.
The pensioners were described as an ''extremely quiet'' group of
''reasonably elderly gentlemen'' by brewery communications manager Arwyn
Owen in Cardiff.
He said they would have had ''one or two small glasses of the beer''
before an hour-long tour of the brewery.
Afterwards they had a ploughman's lunch and sandwiches, and ''one or
two more small glasses of beer''.
He added: ''The coach drivers always have soft drinks.''
Mr Brian Gwynne, 58, who operates Laguna Travel, which has two
coaches, said: ''I was stunned when a policeman arrived at my door to
break this terrible news. Our coaches have never been involved in an
accident before. As a coach owner it's the sort of experience you hope
you will never have to go through.''
He was waiting to hear details of the accident from driver Stephen
Brown, 39, who was treated in hospital for minor injuries and later went
home.
Mr Gwynne added: ''I still know very little about what happened
because I have not been in contact with my driver.''
He said Laguna worked regularly with Legion branches around
Bournemouth.
Mr Gwynne said Mr Brown, who is married with three children, was an
experienced driver and had worked for him for nearly five years. ''I
have known the driver some time. He has been driving all his life and he
is about 38 years old.
''He is a very safe driver and he's never been involved in any
accidents.''
He added: ''The coach was approximately nine years old.It was
partially fitted with seat belts, not 100%. My understanding is that no
other vehicle was involved.''
At the Royal British Legion building in Christchurch the Union flag
hung at half mast as anxious visitors came and went, one woman leaving
in tears, while police officers stood outside.
The British Legion provided welfare staff to help cope with the
distress and cars were made available to pick up people from Bristol who
were well enough to travel.
At the Legion's London headquarters, Secretary General Lieutenant
Colonel Philip Creasy described the tragedy as ''appalling''.
He said: ''This tragedy will certainly be felt not just by the
families and friends but by the people of Christchurch as a whole and by
the Royal British Legion nationwide.''
He added ''It is an appalling tragedy especially at this time of year
just after VE Day.''
The Liberal Democrat MP for Christchurch, Ms Diana Maddock, said the
crash was a ''tragedy''.
''This is an absolutely tragic accident and our immediate sympathies
must go to all those involved and to their families.''
She added: ''Everyone will want to know how such a terrible accident
could occur.''
Mr John Skinner, general manager at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, said:
''We have been training for an emergency like this for 15 years. We have
never seen anything like it before. Staff have been called in to help
and we're putting our red alert procedure into practice.''
More than 50 paramedics, policemen and firefighters were scrambled to
the crash site. A special rescue crane was dispatched to help
firefighters to free the injured from the wreckage.
Ambulances were being escorted to and from the scene by police motor
cyclists.
Ms Ann Lloyd, chief executive of Frenchay Healthcare Trust, said: ''We
were originally told to expect 30 patients. As we are the regional
centre for neurology, plastic surgery, and burns we were expecting the
more seriously injured patients.
Two casualties were in a critical condition at Frenchay Hospital.
A hospital spokeswoman said both were female and in intensive care.
Two more victims previously in intensive care had been moved to a high
dependency ward.
Three other less seriously injured casualties were being looked after
in general wards.
The spokeswoman said the victims had suffered mainly chest and head
injuries. Some had undergone surgery.
Casualties were also taken to the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in
Gloucester, the Bristol Royal Infirmary.
Mr John Gray, spokesman for Bristol Royal Infirmary, said later that
six passengers were being detained overnight -- two with serious
injuries in the intensive care unit and four with less serious injuries
on the accident ward.
Seven other injured had gone home, including one with relatives in the
Bristol area.
One of the injured allowed home was believed to be the coach driver.
The injured men and women were aged from their 30s to over 70.
None of the patients wanted to talk to the media. ''They are all
shocked, concerned about their relatives and anxious to return to their
homes,'' he said.
Most could remember little of what happened but a woman in her 30s
could recall the bus swerving -- ''That was all she could recall''.
Extra blood was being taken to the hospitals to supply transfusions to
the injured.
Mr Tim Wallington, medical director of the National Blood Transfusion
Service in Bristol said: ''We had calls from both Frenchay and the Royal
Infirmary.
''We scrambled 100 pints of blood to the two hospitals and contacted
Birmingham, Cardiff, Oxford and Southampton in case we needed back up.''
Motorist Richard Thomas, 29, of Bristol, passed the scene just seconds
after the accident. He said: ''It was absolutley horrific. There was a
coach which had ploughed down a bank. It was upside down and its roof
had caved in.
''I had never seen anything like it in my life. I hate to think what
must have happened to the people inside.''
Station Officer Dando said he had never seen such an horrific crash in
his 15 years with the service. ''The roof is completely crushed to
within inches of the coach floor. When I first arrived it was utter
carnage -- a scene of total devastation.
''There were half a dozen people wandering around on the motorway,
bloody and dazed. I can only describe them as the walking wounded.
''I have no idea how they got out of the wreckage. They could have
climbed out or they could have been flung out in the crash. I saw a few
women among the injured but, thank God, there were no children.
''Many people suffered crush injuries and cuts from glass. Human flesh
was not designed to take the impact of metal and glass.''
The coach had been travelling along a flat, level stretch of road when
it suddenly left the road.
Friends of the victims last night spoke of their ''shock and
disbelief''. Mr Donald Nias, 41, landlord of the Royalty pub in
Christchurch, the local for veterans of the Second World War, said: ''I
had friends on that coach. All we can do is wait to hear who has died
and who has survived.
''We are very deeply shocked at the news. It is a terrible, terrible
tragedy.''
At 7pm, two and a half hours after the crash, more than 120 rescue
workers were still at the scene.
Emergency services erected an inflatable casualty unit in the slow
lane of the motorway to treat the injured.
A spokesman for Almondsbury motorway police said: ''This is the worst
coach crash in this part of the country and possibly nationally that we
have ever had to deal with.''
All fatalities were understood to have been taken to Southmead
Hospital.
Mr Joe Starling, 67, president of the Bristol City Branch of the Royal
British Legion, rushed to Frenchay Hospital ''to help -- because that is
what we do in the Legion''.
Pensioner John Pearce whose cousin's husband Tom Park was on the coach
said: ''Tom said it was absolutely horrific. He managed to crawl out of
a broken window when the coach came to a standstill upside down.
''He said he was very lucky to be alive. We are so thankful he
suffered only cuts and bruises.''

THE search for a mother who is on the run with her two-year-old
daughter in defiance of a series of court orders is now being
concentrated in Scotland.
Glasgow-born Angela Garcia, 28, left the United States with her
daughter, Catherine, in November 1993 for a six-week holiday in the UK,
but then telephoned her American husband Daniel to tell him she was not
coming back.
She was last seen at her grandmother's house in Barlogan Avenue,
Craigton, Glasgow, on April 9 this year and the custody dispute is now
the subject of court orders in the US, England, and Scotland.
Mrs Garcia (formerly Angela Devlin) married US Air Force Sergeant
Daniel Garcia, 31, in Corby, Northamptonshire, in June 1990. They moved
to Arizona the following September and Catherine was born in January
1993.
In November that year Mrs Garcia came back to Britain with Catherine
for a six-week holiday. She had return air tickets but, on January 2,
1994, called her husband to inform him that neither she nor Catherine
were coming back.
The following month Mr Garcia filed a petition for divorce and for
custody of his daughter in the US.
That same month the US court asked the courts in England for an order
under the Hague Convention for Catherine's return and in June last year
Mr Justice Wilson ruled that Catherine should be sent back immediately
to the US.
This followed undertakings by the father that he would provide air
tickets, accommodation, and financial support on their return for his
wife and daughter. Mr Garcia bought the tickets for a flight on July 7
last year but Mrs Garcia and Catherine never boarded the plane.
The following day Mr Justice Singer issued a seek-and-locate order and
the next month the English courts granted leave to Mr Garcia's solicitor
to mount a press and TV campaign to try to locate the mother and
daughter.
Last month, English court officers received information that Mrs
Garcia and Catherine were staying at an address in Barlogan Road,
Glasgow, and police located her there on April 9.
They told her of the existence of the English court order, but by the
time court officers arrived from England the mother and child had
vanished.
After Mrs Garcia was located in Scotland the English court action was
transferred to the Court of Session where both Lords Clyde and Cullen
have now issued orders directing messengers at arms to search for and
remove Catherine so that she can be sent back to the United States.
