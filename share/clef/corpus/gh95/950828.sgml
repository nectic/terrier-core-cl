THE Russians have agreed to construct and operate, at least initially
with the requisite fuel, two new nuclear reactors for Iran. Less
assuredly known, but widely suspected, is another agreement to provide a
range of biological weapons to the Iranians. These have already been
developed and vary from relatively well-known substances like anthrax to
entirely new toxins, not all of which have attracted antidotes, and some
of which are unknown to Western scientists. The development has been
anticipated by Western, particularly American, diplomacy, but it has
come to pass in spite of all efforts. Nothing the US could offer
financially could offset the appeal of multi-billion dollar swops from
the Iranians whose own oil industry is not as crippled as its Russian
counterpart.
The American efforts included direct intervention by President Carter
and contact with President Yeltsin himself. The outcome indicates Mr
Yeltsin's failing clout and the way authority on military affairs has
become fragmented: the high command desperately needs cash to pay
soldiers' wages which are often now in considerable arrears. Even more
generally, the Russian economy is starved of hard currency and both
sales of weapons and hi-tech ''know how'' attract immediate payment in
dollars. It is hard to see how the Americans can interdict such traffic
by lending Russia even more. The sums are all too great and the salient
fact of the economy's refusal to grow remains paramount. Yet the dangers
of these deals, even to Russia itself, remain evident. The one
consolation is that even with all the knowledge they are buying, expert
opinion believes the Iranians will remain five years short of a nuclear
weapon. As with early Iraqi installations, the new Russian-designed
reactors will have peaceful purposes in mind from the beginning. But
that is an unavoidable subterfuge. No-one will say they are from the
beginning seeking to make nuclear weapons, but the capacity to do so is
a direct by-product of the peaceful process, and it is impossible to see
the Iranians foregoing the opportunity. As for biological and chemical
weapons there is no room for dubiety at all -- if the proposed sale
takes place, the Russians are selling sophisticated weapons or mass
destruction to an unstable society on their own southern frontier. It is
an unwise policy, though the first potential victims are Iran's Arab
neighbours, with Israel a close second.
In retrospect, all such developments are the consequence of the way in
which the old Soviet economy was allowed to implode. It produced so
little anybody else wanted to buy. Weapons are the great exception and
it is their sale which is now funding much of the attempt to contain the
effects of the collapse. It seems to be impossible to identify any
positive consequences of this deal. Even the peaceful use of nuclear
power which could benefit most countries is an expensive luxury for Iran
given its enormous energy resource in oil. The present transactions look
to be entirely military with the one excuse the unprovoked Iraqi
invasion which produced Saddam Hussein's first war which he lost but
only narrowly and at enormous Iranian cost. Beyond that of course is the
militant stance of Iran vis-a-vis the rest of the Middle East.
Inside five years a sustained attempt must be made to bring Iran back
into some rational dialogue with the West. There are signs that the
present Iranian Government is, for reasons of its own, anxious to bring
about this change. A nuclear and biologically armed rogue state outside
the community of nations is a huge threat to peace. The Russians have
made it possible for Iran to take that road.

SECOND DIVISION
STRANRAER'S lack of commitment in the 3-0 defeat away to Stenhousemuir
on Saturday earned their players an extra stint of training yesterday,
writes Bill Sutherland.
Tiredness after their midweek exertions was ''not an acceptable
excuse'' as far as manager Alex McAnespie was concerned. ''No-one
performed apart from Stevie Ross,'' he complained.
The keeper was beaten by an Ian Little header from a corner in 18
minutes, but battled bravely. The Warriors dominated the second half and
struck twice within a couple of minutes.
Paul Logan's shot was parried to Miller Mathieson, who headed in the
rebound. Jimmy Fisher then sidestepped his marker out on the left to
send in a right-foot shot from the angle of the box.
Top of the table are East Fife, whose second win came via a goal in 33
minutes against Ayr United, Robert Scott converting a Steve Archibald
cross.
The crowd of 1213 at Broadwood saw a repeat of the opening-day defeat
by East Stirlingshire in the Coca-Cola Cup. A header by Eddie Annand
gave Clyde the lead but again they conceded two goals in quick
succession, a David Bingham header and Doug Craig's volley giving Forfar
a 2-1 win.
Berwick shrugged off two cup defeats to hammer Stirling Albion 3-0.
One-time Albion man Willie Irvine struck twice and Graeme Fraser once.
Queen of the South gave Montrose a Colin McGlashan goal of a start but
doubles by John McLaren and veteran Colin Harris made it 4-1 as Queens
went daft in the closing minutes.

Sheffield Wednesday 0, Newcastle Utd 2
FRENCH winger David Ginola confirmed his status as the most impressive
of the current crop of foreigners imported into English football with a
stunning goal at Hillsborough yesterday. It put Newcastle, the
championship favourites, on their way to the top of the table on goal
difference from Leeds United, the only other team with an unblemished
record after three matches.
Seven minutes into the second half, Ginola carried the ball square
along the edge of the penalty area, slipped his marker and drove a shot
into the far corner. Peter Beardsley secured the points 23 minutes later
with a goal that, coming from most other players, would have been
regarded as a fluke. In Beardsley's case, it was quite possible to
believe that he intended a curling cross-shot from an acute angle to
finish in the net.
* NOW that the Premiership has at last been reduced to a more
manageable 20 clubs, those hoping to win it cannot afford to lose any
more than six of their 38 games. So whatever noises are made about these
being early days, being beaten twice in a week has already handicapped
the champions Blackburn Rovers as they prepare for tonight's televised
encounter with Manchester United.
Having to play local derbies in the space of three days against
newly-promoted Bolton and then the team who have gone head-to-head with
them for the title in the past two seasons emphasises the intensity of
the task facing Blackburn. Throw in Everton's victory in the FA Charity
Shield at Wembley, and three defeats in four games is not an auspicious
start to what is supposed to be the biggest season in their history --
all this just as the draw for the European Champions' League mapped out
their arduous schedule on an entirely different front.
Even bearing in mind the time of year, the importance of tonight's
game at Ewood Park is immense. Blackburn badly need a victory in their
first game against major opposition, while United must continue their
rehabilitation after that drubbing at Villa Park on the opening day.
Alex Ferguson's side make the short journey in much better heart
following successive home wins against West Ham and Wimbledon, during
which Andy Cole and Ryan Giggs both returned ahead of schedule.
On Saturday Cole scored a characteristic goal in a 3-1 success and
Giggs later replaced him for an encouraging 20 minutes.
For once nobody dared to mention the names of Andrei Kanchelskis and
Mark Hughes, two of the proven warriors allowed to leave during the
summer. Kanchelskis did well in his first game for Everton, a 2-0 win
over Southampton, though Duncan Ferguson was missing and may need
surgery on a groin.
Hughes has been less successful for Chelsea, who have not managed a
goal from anyone in their opening three matches. The third of them, on
Saturday, was a 2-0 defeat that commemorated the opening of a another
magnificent ground -- Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium. A little
further south Leeds claimed their third victory, this one by 2-0 against
Aston Villa.
Chelsea are once again not the only London team under-achieving.
Tottenham, without five of last season's team for various reasons, were
utterly outplayed 3-1 on their own ground by a Liverpool side managing
quite happily without the injured Stan Collymore.

Morton 1, Dumbarton 2
ON paper this looks like another desperately disappointing result for
Morton and sweet revenge for Dumbarton.
It was defeat by Morton in the second-last game of last season that
denied them the championship, but this result should not make them too
complacent nor Morton too disheartened.
In an extraordinary game, Morton dominated, despite being reduced to
10 men after just eight minutes. Two first-half goals and a lot of
defending were enough to see Dumbarton through.
At half-time, the scoreline could have read: Arts and Industry 0,
Opportunism 2.
A speculative Colin McKinnon shot tempted John Anderson into a moment
of madness in the eighth minute.
When David Wylie muffed a punched clearance, McKinnon volleyed back
into the goal and Anderson punched the ball over his own bar and was
subsequently red-carded.
Martin Mooney was efficient from the penalty spot and Morton already
looked down and out. They came back ferociously, however, and accurate
passes and biting tackles had Dumbarton in a flat spin.
Just as Morton looked certain to equalise, another moment of
opportunism slapped them down again after 34 minutes.
Chic Charnley picked up the ball near the halfway line, glanced up,
and lobbed Wylie, who was well off his line.
Even this sensational goal didn't dampen Morton's spirits and they
continue to press their case for the rest of the match, pulling a goal
back in the second half but never quite managing an equaliser.
Morton manager Allan McGraw admitted blame had to be attached to his
goalkeeper. ''I know keepers see themselves as sweepers, but he should
never have been so far from his line. Goalkeepers have to defend the
goal above all else.''
Dumbarton caretaker manager Jim Fallon was happy to concede that his
team had been outplayed. ''However, I would rather be here with the win
and I'm sure Allan McGraw would be to. Our defence was outstanding.''

ROWING:
Tampere, Finland
BRITAIN failed to add to its medal count on the third and last day of
finals at this year's World Championships yesterday, but still finished
with a record haul of six medals -- two gold and four silver.
Two men's crews were in final action yesterday, but the eight could
finish only sixth and last behind surprise winners Germany, while the
lightweight four crossed the line fifth in a tight race won by Italy.
The British women's eight, with former Edinburgh University captain
Dot Blackie aboard, raced well to win the B final, for a ranking of
seventh overall.
Following Peter Haining's heroic and historic victory on Friday,
Britain's flagship crew, the reigning Olympic and world champion pair of
Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent imperiously retained their title on
Saturday to record their fifty-second consecutive victory.
These were the only golds won by Britain this year, but no-one came
closer to joining these two crews than the men's coxless four of Tim
Foster, Rupert Obholzer, and Olympic cox pairs champions Jon and Greg
Searle, who just lost out on the run-in to reigning world champions
Italy in their final on Saturday.
Other British silvers were won by the men's lightweight eight, who
lost their title to Denmark, the women's lightweight four, and the
women's light pair.

TENNIS: US OPEN
GREG Rusedski leads Britain's quartet of singles hopefuls into battle
in the US Open today -- the first time that four British players have
qualified for the tournament since 1979.
Former Canadian Rusedski and Jeremy Bates earned their tickets to
Flushing Meadow on the basis of their rankings -- 52 and 107
respectively -- while Mark Petchey and Tim Henman both came through the
qualifying rounds.
Rusedski opens against little-known Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink,
ranked 222 in the world, and could face former French champion Sergi
Bruguera in the third round.
Bates opens against Spain's Emilio Sanchez and it is not beyond the
former British No.1 to reach the third round.
Petchey, ranked 139, enjoyed a fine victory over Karol Kucera in the
first round last year. This time the Essex player has drawn the
dangerous South African Marcos Ondruska, ranked 102.
Henman will play fellow qualifier Juan Albert Viloca, of Spain, in
what is the 20-year-old Oxford player's first main draw appearance in a
grand-slam event outside Wimbledon. Henman is ranked No.145 against
Viloca's 159.
The last time Britain had four men in the US Open men's singles was 16
years ago, when the four were John Lloyd, Buster Mottram, Mark Cox, and
Colin Dowdeswell.
The only British entrant in the women's qualifying tournament, Clare
Wood, lost in the first round to US Open junior champion Meilen Tu.

EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP
SIMON MacKenzie, in fifteenth place, was leading Scot in the European
Amateur individual golf championship in Barcelona. A final round of 72,
level par, gave the Scottish amateur champion a 72-hole total of 286,
two under par.
That left him 10 strokes adrift of the winner, 15-year-old Spaniard
Sergio Garcia -- already being hailed as the new Ballesteros -- who
finished with a 69 for a 276 total and a one-stroke victory over
Sweden's Mattias Eliasson.
MacKenzie got to four under par for the championship after 12 holes
thanks to an eagle 3 at the long ninth and then a birdie at the twelfth.
However, he dropped shots at the thirteenth, fourteenth, and seventeenth
holes.
Hugh McKibbin completed a highly consistent tournament with a third
successive round of 72 to finish on 287 in a tie for eighteenth place.
Defending champion Stephen Gallacher returned a 71 yesterday but was
well out of contention on 290, with his fellow Walker Cup team member
Barclay Howard a further shot back. Leading final scores:
276 -- S Garcia (Spain) 68, 72, 67, 69.
277 -- M Eliasson (Sweden) 71, 70, 66, 70.
278 -- D Howell (Broome Manor) 70, 66, 71, 71.
281 -- A Langenaeken (Belgium) 74, 70, 71, 66; M Brier (Austria) 74,
73, 67, 67.
Scottish scores: 286 -- S MacKenzie (West Linton) 72, 73, 69, 72. 287
-- H McKibbin (Troon) 71, 72, 72, 72. 290 -- S Gallacher (Bathgate) 72,
77, 70, 71. 291 -- B Howard (Cochrane Castle) 71, 70, 75, 75. 295 -- A
Reid (Kilmarnock Barassie) 78, 74, 71, 72.

IT IS a long way from the beaches of Lewis to the sand pits of Europe,
in which Jonathan Edwards has plied his trade this season. The world
triple-jump champion's wife, Alison, is from Achmore, near Stornoway,
and he enjoys the solitude of training there.
His technique, which brought him a UK all-comers' record yesterday in
the McDonald's Games at Crystal Palace, might have been learned
loitering by the shore.
The action which Edwards has brought to his event, like a boy skimming
flat stones off water, contrasts with the more common pounding style,
and left all his opponents at sea, or marooned behind him in sand.
Edwards defeated the world silver and bronze medallists with a UK
all-comers' record of 18.00 metres, the third-longest legal jump behind
his two records at the world championships.
''Some people are born to be good, and it is no surprise to them --
but it is to me,'' he said. ''It is unbelievable, hard to take in.''
In every contest this year, Edwards has jumped further than his best
before this season (17.44), when a virus looked as though it might
finish his career. At this meeting 12 months ago, he could manage only a
wind-assisted 15.85m.
''My body aches, and I did not expect to jump as far as this again
this season,'' added Edwards. ''There have been so many pressures . . .
You become like a commodity, everyone asking you to do things -- I was
even asked to abseil off the Tyne Bridge, for charity -- the answer was
no.''
Nor can he believe what it has done financially. ''I can remember
getting $100 to compete in Lausanne, in 1990, and Tom McKean was taking
the mickey, because he was getting $12,000.''
Glasgow's David Strang was first Briton in the 800m, but in attempting
to match the suicidal pace of the leaders (24.03 at 200, 50.6 at the
bell) he burned himself out, finishing eighth in 1-49.36.
But Yvonne Murray ran her fastest 3000m of the year (8-42.82), second
behind world champion Sonia O'Sullivan, thanks to emergency treatment on
her back.
''I thought I wouldn't be able to run until Saturday night,'' said the
Motherwell woman. ''Then the chiropractor who travels with Jon Drummond
took a look at me. He told me to take a deep breath, then let it out,
and as I did so, he cracked my spine. The effect was incredible. I ran
pain-free today -- almost in tears with relief.''
Drummond himself almost cracked Linford Christie's resolve, holding
him off in the 100m. A dead-heat in 10.11 was the official result. ''I
thought I had it until Linford stuck his big chest out,'' said Drummond.
Glasgow's Mel Neef, exhausted, had her slowest 400m race of the
season, finishing seventh, in 52.49, on a windy afternoon.
Tony Jarrett, who had lost his previous 31 successive hurdles races to
Colin Jackson, finally got ahead of the Welsh world record-holder. Yet
after three years of seeing his rival's back, he was again denied the
satisfaction of victory. The American world champion, Allen Johnson,
crossed the line in 13.05, relieving Jackson of the stadium record, with
Jarrett timed at 13.14, and Jackson at 13.20.
There were no Scots in the Emsley Carr Mile -- won in the race's
fastest time (3-49.80) by Venuste Niyongabo -- all being relegated to a
development 1500m. Ian Gillespie finished fourth (3-44.14), Grant Graham
sixth (3-44.30), Gary Brown eighth (3- 45.44), and Glen Stewart
fourteenth (3-53.89).
But Anglo Vicky Lawrence won the women's 800m development event in
2-06.57, and Achmed Al-Kowari (Aberdeen) and Richard McDonald (Perth)
clocked 49.81 and 50.31 in the boys' 400m.

St Mirren 0, St Johntone 0
FOR their visits to Paisley, St Johnstone have a good, simple habit.
They don't lose. Even the greyest memory boxes cannot recall when last
they went home with nothing. Thirty years, they suggested; perhaps more.
It has been yonks enough hardly to count. Whenever it happened was in
another football age. Both clubs have since seen generations of change.
Only St Johnstone's knack for being modestly quids-in has stayed the
same. On Saturday, they sustained a club tradition with a squad who
looked young enough to believe that last season is history already.
Sometimes they seemed new even to each other. Yet behind the raw
eagerness were glimpses of a settled core. They had an outline of mature
firmness and formidable shape.
Having a canny head on broad young shoulders was personified by Danny
Griffin, who at 18 had been chosen by his team-mates to be captain for
the day. Early on, he showed his alert agility. When an initial flurry
by St Mirren was about to peter out, the burly Lavety was steaming for
goal after collecting a quick, deadly Alex Bone pass. Instantly Griffin
was right there to nip the ball away.
He appeared to enjoy the incident, with a small burst of tap dancing
that made an agreeable change from the heavy-duty stopper chores that a
makeshift team selection had laid on him in central defence.
Paul Sturrock, the St Johnstone manager, could hardly contain his
enthusiasm for the boundless potential he saw in a midfield maestro of
the future. For going on with, however, there was not much to ignite the
passion of the 2424 crowd.
It was an agreeable, almost saintly encounter. Although four players
were booked, two were for yapping at the referee.
After a lifeless first half, the contest brightened, although a goal
felt increasingly unlikely. Griffin's solid performance was matched at
the other end by a steady captain's game from St Mirren's Robert Dawson.
With two such steely skippers on board, it was going to take a bold
crew member with a mind of his own to rock the boat or burst the
rigging. Such individual flair as St Mirren showed came mostly from
Ricky Gillies, who bobbed up brightly in unlikely places, and had a
crack on the turn from 20 yards or so that struck a post.
Kevin Twaddle -- like Gillies, a substitute -- showed a similar
independent approach that made the second thoughts of both managers
easier to enjoy than their first. Twaddle eluded his markers by having
the stamina and speed to give them a wide berth and his crossing was not
bad at all.
St Mirren's failure to sustain their opening burst was hard to figure.
''It won't do,'' Jimmy Bone the manager said. He appeared as much
puzzled as disappointed.

Dundee 1, Airdrie 1
DUNDEE's Michel Pageaud did . . . Airdrie's Peter Duffield did not . .
. and the age-old maxim that ''he who hesitates is lost'' was acted out
and confirmed yet again in this draw at Dens Park.
The Dark Blues, ahead since the sixth minute of the action through an
Andy Cargill corner which bent in at the near post, to the intense
embarrassment of John Martin and company in the Airdrie defence, entered
the last minute of normal time at long odds-on to extend their 100%
record into a fourth league and cup outing.
Enter Lady Luck, as home defenders slipped to allow Diamonds'
close-season capture Duffield the chance to burst through an alarming
central defensive chasm on a solo run which took him deep into the home
penalty box.
Keeper Pageaud, who minutes earlier had denied the visitors with two
of the best saves seen at the ground in a long time, stood alone as the
home salvation as the pint-sized Duffield made to round him.
The Frenchman admitted afterwards: ''I could and maybe should have
brought him down, leaving us to take our chances with a penalty kick.
But I suppose it flashed through my mind that I was red-carded for being
judged to do something similar last season, and I just checked myself.''
Duffield displayed no such hint of hesitation and promptly sidestepped
the keeper to net a first and vital league goal for his new club.
Unusual or not, the equaliser earned Alex MacDonald's visitors a point
which at one stage had appeared highly unlikely, and yet, in the end,
was deserving of the effort expended in achieving it with just 10 men,
Sandy Stewart being ordered off 11 minutes into the second half for a
second bookable offence.
Remarkably that incident, when allied to the introduction of Paul
Harvey just 60 seconds earlier, served to provide some much-needed
inspiration into the Airdrie performance.
And, while Dundee conspired to create but waste the game's best
scoring chances, Airdrie slowly built up a head of steam with which to
fuel their own late charge.

WORLD SERIES
GREG Norman clinched one of the most memorable victories of his career
at the World Series of golf in Akron, Ohio, yesterday. Norman, on the
losing end of so many unlucky breaks, chipped in for a birdie from 20
metres at the first extra hole to win a three-way play-off at Firestone
Country Club.
Zimbabwean Nick Price and American Billy Mayfair could not match
Norman's birdie, leaving the Australian an unlikely winner.
The Australian, who was persuaded by his wife Laura not to quit after
his first-round rules run-in with Mark McCumber, whose card he refused
to sign, said: ''Always listen to your wife.'' He also revealed that as
he approached his chip he told himself to remember the 1990 Doral Open,
when he chipped in to win a four-way play-off.
''The game of golf always evens out,'' he philosophised. ''I hope you
guys write about this one as much as all the other things that have
happened to me.''
Norman -- who plays this week in the European Masters in Switzerland
-- got into the play-off with a closing three-under-par 67. He finished
at two-under-par 278, and then watched as Price and Mayfair stumbled
with late bogeys. Two-time Open champion Norman, 40, won $360,000 for
his fifteenth victory on the American Tour, and his third this year. He
also becomes the all-time leading money-winner on the American Tour on
$9,493,579, passing Tom Kite.
It was a tale of two halves for Andrew Coltart. After shooting 79 and
78 in the first two rounds, Coltart was in danger of recording the
highest score in the tournament's history. Over the final two rounds,
however, he came to terms with the Firestone course and carded 67 on
Saturday and 71 yesterday to finish at 15-over 295.
Playing with a painful right shoulder, the result of a fall incurred
during an ill-conceived sprint race on Thursday night, Coltart dropped
five shots in five holes mid-round yesterday. The former Scottish boys'
and Scottish professional champion recovered, however, to compile three
successive birdies starting at the thirteenth and finish on a positive
note. ''It was a bit of a learning process,'' said Coltart, who finished
thirty-fifth among the 44 players to complete the tournament.''
He will find the course considerably easier at the Greater Milwaukee
Open starting on Thursday.
Coltart played the final three rounds with a sore shoulder after
suffering a fall in a hastily-arranged sprint against Wayne Riley on
Thursday night. Primed by a few beers, Coltart and Scottish Open
champion Riley decided to race over about 60 metres. Nearing the finish,
Coltart fell on his right shoulder on the paved road, while Riley
sustained a knee injury which led to the Australian's withdrawing from
the tournament after the third round. Leading final scores (Americans
unless stated):
278 -- G Norman (Australia) 73, 68, 70, 67; N Price (Zimbabwe) 72, 69,
69, 68; B Mayfair 70, 68, 70, 70. Norman won play-off.
279 -- P Mickelson 69, 74, 70, 66; V Singh (Fiji) 71, 69, 65, 74.
280 -- F Couples 68, 76, 68, 68; J Gallagher 66, 71, 70, 73.
281 -- M Sullivan 71, 67, 74, 69.
282 -- L Roberts 72, 74, 70, 66; J M Olazabal (Spain) 68, 70, 69, 65.
Others included: 284 -- N Faldo (England) 71, 71, 70, 72. 295 -- A
Coltart (Scotland) 79, 78, 67, 71.

Partick Thistle aficionado IAN ARCHER examines the takeover bid by
Asian businessmen that has been mooted for the Firhill club.
A GROUP of Glasgow businessmen from the Asian community in the city
have expressed an interest in buying Partick Thistle. It just goes to
show they must be about as daft in Delhi as we are around this place,
praise be.
The reaction all the way from the Elephant and Bugle to the Arlington
Bar has been unanimous.
These men would be good and resourceful owners of the club and should
be given the chance to move Thistle towards their rightful place as
European Cup holders.
Mr Charan Gill has fed me splendidly in his many restaurants and,
although I have not yet learned to work a video, Mr Maq Rasul clearly
keeps the couch potatoes happy. Their presence in the Firhill boardroom
would add a new dimension to Scottish football.
There will be those who see the Asian connection as a sign that this
community now feels assertive enough to become involved at the heart of
our world, which is football. But it is nothing of the sort.
Thistle were run for many decades by the Reid family -- Tom and then
Miller -- whose interests were in the licensed trade, the very kind of
local person who gave football clubs what the lonely-hearts columns
called TLC before the smart money muscled in. This takeover is part of
that tradition.
The Asians have long been accepted around Maryhill or, being
geographically pedantic, in Woodside.
They have been assimilated like the Irish, the Italians, and the Poles
before them, adding a density to the Glasgow experience.
Any schoolteacher will tell you that his or her heart rises in front
of ranks of Asian kids in class. They will be quiet, polite, and keen to
learn, unlike some sections of our own proletariat.
The most cursory of glances at the graduation list from Glasgow
University shows that if there is to be some enlightenment in the West
of Scotland in the next century, they will form its bedrock.
My own experience is anecdotal, but none the worse for that.
A few years ago, Pakistan came to play cricket against Scotland at
Titwood. It rained. The cosseted players stayed in the pavilion and
would not sign autographs.
Through the crowd came an Asian gentleman to deliver his opinion of
such arrogance. ''Yous,'' he said ''are nothing but a bunch of
nig-nogs.'' Except there was added the adjective which always brings
perfect symmetry to Glasgow invective.
Then there was Rocky, a waiter in my favourite Indian restaurant, the
Shimla Pinks in Johnstone (not one of Mr Gill's), who commuted there
from Dumbarton Road.
He said one night that he would be away for a while because of some
family reunion in Delhi and this did not impress him, because he would
miss his five-a-sides and his beloved Rangers. ''The place sounds like a
hell hole,'' he said, adding the adjective which brings a perfect
symmetry to Glasgow invective.
Three weeks later he was back, entranced. ''Magic place. Never seen so
many five-a-side pitches. It's all wrong, but they've got better
facilities than Glasgow, the home of football.
''How are the Gers playing, by the way?''
There is one thing which bothers me, though. Since this takeover was
first leaked, no-one has actually referred to Partick Thistle any more.
It needs no demonic crossword puzzler to realise that it has been
abbreviated by removing three consonants then rearranging the remaining
four letters into a different order.
In these politically correct times, there will be those who object.
The world seems full of people like the Race Relations Board, stress
councillors, anti-smoking campaigners, and even those who think there
isn't enough meat in a Big Mac, who are determined that we should not
speak our minds.
On behalf of that bunch of non-conformists, happy bohemians, detesters
of bigotry, the simple plain barmy, and the very proper ones from the
Bearsden and Milngavie outstation who make up Firhill's faithful, I will
cheerfully break the taboo.
''Away the Jags, the Harry Wraggs, the Paki Thistle.''

'There is nothing quite like a handful of good results on a football
pitch and two Andy Gorams to make the world look a better place. Right
now, planet football is vibrant.'
THE old failings may still be with us -- lack of passing ability, not
enough technique, and a woeful absence of creative thinking -- but let
us not dwell on the negative this morning. Open the curtains and take a
good, long look at what could lie ahead. Scottish football is in Europe
and it's a wonderful feeling.
The game on the domestic front started rolling in earnest on Saturday,
when the premier-division clubs went out to play, but it was what had
gone before that put a spring in the step.
Scotland, Rangers, and Raith Rovers already had given supporters a
lift with results against foreign opponents, and Celtic, although facing
a difficult trip to Georgia in the European Cup-winners' Cup, might
present another opportunity for this small nation to crow.
In recent times there has not been much to excite the fans, indeed the
game has been on a downward spiral in terms of skill and spectacle. Club
sides were prone to falling early in the three European competitions and
the national side, which failed to qualify for the last World Cup
finals, appeared to be faltering in the quest to reach the finals of the
European Championship.
However, from the moment one of the game's forgotten men, Ally
McCoist, was released from the Hampden dug-out just under a fortnight
ago and scored the goal which positioned Craig Brown's team in a
powerful position within Group 8, people began to dream again. Maybe
this year. Perhaps this will be the season when the bedraggled, unshaven
troops will be able to puff out their chests and walk tall on spindly
legs again.
There is nothing quite like a handful of good results on a football
pitch and two Andy Gorams to make the world look a better place. Right
now, planet football is vibrant, although Motherwell's fans will still
be depressed by their team's UEFA Cup defeat by Finnish side MyPA-47,
but at least they can line up behind the national side without
distraction.
The club scene usually benefits when teams are involved in European
competitions, with interest spreading among the fans of most clubs,
because most of the game's disciples relish the sight of the best
professionals at work. After all, it is in everyone's interest to see
how players from different countries kick the ball.
Horizons are broadened and for a short time we all feel part of a
larger game, although if we search within ourselves we realise that we
are not exactly main players in the major competitions, because
somewhere back there we took our eyes off the ball and Johnny Foreigner
ran away with it.
So far he hasn't passed it back to us yet, even though we try every
year to regain possession, but if we manage to stay on the European bus
beyond the first stop, we might be driven closer to the secrets of
football life. Scottish teams and supporters might just begin to accept
again that if you can't pass or think quickly enough, then you can't
perform properly.
Scotland still have a difficult European qualifying match against
Finland a week on Wednesday, but their win against Greece earlier this
month strengthened considerably their chances of qualification, and the
wave of confidence which is washing over Brown's players should carry
them into the draw for the finals in England. It is there we will see
most of the finest players in the modern European game and it is there
we must learn.
No-one expects Scotland to win the European crown, Rangers to win the
Champions' Cup, Celtic to play in the final of the Cup-winners' Cup, or
Raith Rovers to be around when the UEFA Cup medals are being
distributed, but the longer each side stays in the field, the more their
players should be able to learn. Also, the fans must watch and
appreciate real football.
The proper game is played with less of the premier division's
desperation and more skill and thought, the qualities which will be
demonstrated by Rangers' opponents in the Champions' League and also by
those who remain in UEFA's two other cup competitions.
It would be sheer folly of any Rangers supporter to believe Steaua
Bucharest -- Rangers start their campaign in Bucharest two weeks on
Wednesday night -- will fall simply because they lost 4-0 at Ibrox in a
pre-season competition. The Romanians are formidable. When the matches
are important these sides play with flair and a feel for the ball which
only the truly skilful possess.
Juventus and Borussia Dortmund speak for themselves, and Rangers will
do remarkably well to qualify from Group C in second place. The Italians
start as favourites to win the section with the Germans second, although
neither Steaua nor the Ibrox side should be underestimated.
Rangers, for instance, are likely to benefit from the defensive
triumvirate of Richard Gough, who has started the season in fine form,
Alan McLaren, and Gordan Petric. Once they have had a few more matches
together they will be hard to break down, which will crucial, because
the full backs, Stephen Wright and David Robertson, are liable to give
the ball away too often, putting their own side under pressure.
Wright, in particular, is a source for concern, because he plays like
the person he is. Quiet and unassuming, he rarely looks comfortable when
surrounded by opponents. He and Robertson will always need to have
options when they are in possession and that means their team-mates will
always have to stay close.
Players like Charlie Miller, who is beginning to realise how good he
is, and Brian Laudrup, whenever he is fit again, could make life easier
for their less gifted defenders by always making themselves available.
Also, when Gascoigne is restored to richer health, the midfield could
become a much more productive area for Rangers than it has been for some
time.
However, Gascoigne's mind and body will have to be in proper shape if
his contributions are to be decisive. Thus far his worth to Rangers must
still be a matter of serious doubt.
It is up front where Rangers have most problems, because Mark Hateley,
who has been an absolute hero for the Ibrox side, could be in decline.
While he will continue to score against premier-division defences, his
powers could be on the wane and that would make him less effective
against top-class defenders. Rangers would have to look to Ally McCoist
-- who cannot go on forever, either -- Gordon Durie, and Oleg Salenko.
The fitness level of the Russian, however, is nowhere near optimum and
the Champions' League will be well under way before he is ready.
Celtic, hopefully, will survive their first-round tie against Dynamo
Batumi, although they may have more problems with the civil unrest in
Georgia than their opponents. Tommy Burns would have liked at least a
couple of more new faces in his squad by now, but he is confident his
players will do themselves and the country proud.
They have Andreas Thom and Pierre van Hooydonk, but neither appears to
be an out-and-out striker, which might be causing Burns some concern.
However, in midfield Celtic should be strong and wily enough to compete
for the ball and then use it to effect.
In defence, Tommy Boyd might have a lot of running to do to compensate
for John Hughes' lack of pace -- Celtic will miss Brian O'Neil in Europe
-- and that could create problems against any intricate and slick
European side, of whom there are many.
Raith Rovers have already survived the first European tie of their
history -- a UEFA Cup preliminary outing against Gotu of the Faroe
Islands -- and are happy enough about the next step, a game against
Akranes of Iceland. Jimmy Nicholl has a wealth of European experience
from which he will have to continue to draw, but the freshness of the
challenge may be Raith's strength.
Players like Colin Cameron and Stephen Crawford can advance their
education with these ties and with the likes of Jim McInally behind
them, they should be able to relish this time and make the most of it.
Indeed, all of us should be ready to take everything we can from the
European ties, because it isn't often we get the chance. May we look and
learn and be better for the experiences when Scottish involvement
finally is killed off.

WITH places in the last eight of the Abercorn Builders League Cup at
stake, there were nail-biting finishes to several sections on Saturday.
Cup-holders Petershill needed to beat Glasgow Perthshire by six goals
to enable them to overtake Maryhill at the top of Section E.
They started well, with two goals by McDonald and Kielty in the first
12 minutes of the game, but despite constant pressure couldn't improve
on this before half-time.
In the second half, they scored a further two goals -- McDonald again
and Andrews -- but ran out of time.
Section winners Maryhill will now meet Coltness United in next week's
quarter-finals.
Pollok, seemingly out of contention following last week's 3-0 defeat
by Arthurlie, fought back with a 9-2 midweek win against Benburb and a
6-0 victory over Neilston on Saturday to clinch the section on goal
difference from Arthurlie.
Brownlie and Murray goals gave Blantyre Vics victory over Larkhall
Thistle and passage to the quarter-finals, where they will meet
Baillieston, who won their section with a plus-one goal difference from
Wishaw.
The full quarter-final draw is: Blantyre Vics v Baillieston, Maryhill
v Coltness, Yoker v Shettleston, Rob Roy v Pollok.
Tayport and Downfield remain undefeated in the Tayside Region. On
Saturday a Hamish McKay goal and one from Reilly gave Tayport a 3-2
victory over last season's OVD semi-finalists Lochee United.
Lochee Harp, 3-0 up at half-time against East Craigie, eventually lost
out 5-4.
Luncarty, beaten 8-0 by Brechin Vics, have now lost 33 goals in their
past three games.
Linlithgow Rose continued their excellent start to the season with a
convincing 5-1 win against Bathgate Thistle.
Harthill Royal, controversially promoted to the first division of the
John Walker League, started their campaign in style with a 4-0 win over
Arniston Rangers.
In the Scarlett Cup, Glenafton Athletic had to beat Kello Rovers to
reach the quarter-finals. They went ahead early in the game thanks to a
Billy Mullan strike and dominated the game until the fortieth minute,
when Kello struck with two goals within two minutes from Lennox and
Russell.
In the second half, a double from Victor Kasule, a recent signing from
Portadown, and one from Tom McKenzie took Glenafton through to meet
Maybole in the next round.
Beith, under new manager Dick Brock, had their first victory of the
season on Saturday with a 4-1 win over Winton Rovers. A Quigg double,
Conlan, and Love were their scorers. The quarter-final draw for the
Scarlett Cup is: Kilbirnie v Irvine Meadow, Ardeer v Dalry, Maybole v
Glenafton, Cumnock v Darvel. Results:

Hamilton 0, Clydebank 2
CLYDEBANK struck two stunning first-half goals yesterday through Ken
Eadie and Joe Robertson to leave homeless Hamilton the first division's
only team with no points.
Eadie has scored many a fine goal in his long career but the opener
against Hamilton will rank among the best.
With 14 minutes gone, the striker -- enjoying his testimonial season
and rumoured to be retiring at the end of this campaign -- netted a
spectacular overhead kick from 12 yards after a James Grady pass had
been knocked in the air by Craig Paterson.
Eadie said: ''It's not the first time I have scored like that. In fact
the last time I did it was also against Hamilton a couple of years ago.
''Indeed, one of the Hamilton players said he was sick of me scoring
World Cup goals against them.''
Clydebank, playing in an incredibly bright away kit of yellow and
purple, added a second goal two minutes later when young Robertson
accepted a Grady pass before evading two defenders and slamming a
left-foot shot high into the net beyond David Cormack.
Bankies' coach Brian Wright said afterwards: ''We scored two great
goals but missed easier chances. Our flowing moves in the first half
were superb.''
The afternoon had begun quite promisingly for the home side with
Steven McCormick, Gary Clark, and John McQuade all having good attempts
in the first 10 minutes.
Accies manager Iain Munro said: ''Our approach to the first half was
disappointing and the complete opposite of the performance against
Airdrie on Tuesday. After we missed the early chances, we were punished
and that has been the story of our season so far.''
Accies' lack of firepower is obvious. The closest they got to dragging
themselves back into the game was a 35-yard free kick from Martin
McIntosh which struck the bar.
HAMILTON -- Cormack, McKenzie, McInulty, McEntegart, Paterson,
McIntosh, Clark, Sherry, Baptie, McQuade, McCormick. Substitutes --
McParland, Lorimer, McCulloch.
CLYDEBANK -- Matthews, Tomlinson, Sutherland, Murdoch, Currie,
Nicholls, Robertson, Connell, Eadie, Grady, Bowman. Substitutes --
Kerrigan, Teale, Lovering.
Referee -- E Martindale (Newlands).

Dunfermline 3, Dundee Utd 0
DUNFERMLINE'S own version of Little and Large are certainly no joke as
far as Dundee United are concerned. Allan Moore and Greg Shaw destroyed
the Tayside men with two of the goals at East End Park on Saturday --
and then later proved that they were as good a double act off the field
as on it.
Neither has had an easy time since moving to Dunfermline, but as Moore
admitted: ''Now that I'm finding some form, the fans seem to be warming
to me. That was a fine ovation I got when I was substituted.''
This is the first time for two years that Moore has come through
pre-season training and matches without injury. ''It has given me the
confidence to start taking players on again, and getting in the crosses
for Greg and Stewart Petrie. There's no doubt that with Paul Kinnaird on
the other wing, we are setting up the chances for Greg and Stewart.''
Step in Mr Shaw. ''I got pelters off the boss for having a bad game in
midweek against Ayr. And when their keeper made three cracking saves, I
thought: 'Here we go again.' It was great to see my goal go in.''
Mr Moore: ''Not a bad cross for it, eh?''
That was after 80 minutes and added to Stewart Petrie's opening strike
after 71 minutes when a Kinnaird cross was met by Shaw, but the ball was
blocked on the line. It fell to Petrie, who made no mistake.
Moore's goal came after a sweeping move out of defence by the Fifers,
and he finished it off perfectly with a sweet shot from the right into
the corner of the net.
The game itself was highly entertaining, and so tense that it was like
a time-bomb waiting to go off. The only trouble was nobody knew where
the explosion would be. Dave Bowman, who had been challenging really
hard all afternoon, supplied the answer just after Dunfermline's opening
goal when he put in a crunching tackle on Petrie, and was sent off for
his trouble.
Kinnaird, for his second booking, followed him near the end after
another crunching tackle on Andy McLaren.
Dunfermline manager Bert Paton was rightly delighted with the result.
''We're having a good start to the season. That's two hard opening
games, and to have full points is brilliant. We will be a difficult side
to beat this season. Once the first goal went in today, it was all
one-way traffic.''
Paton, though, agrees that despite United's shaky opening to their
first-division campaign, they'll still be up there challenging by the
spring.
United manager Billy Kirkwood admitted that Dunfermline had taken the
honours in the first half, and that he had ''chatted'' to his troops at
half-time -- a tongue-in-cheek way of saying that they had been given a
rollicking.
''We started well in the second half -- it was ironic they they scored
when we were having our best spell. But we will have to stop giving away
daft goals.''
And thereby lies Dunfermline's secret. They have given only one away
in four games so far this season -- and that was against Ayr United in
midweek. Their reorganised line-up -- which has Ivo Den Biemen and Marc
Millar as attacking full backs, Jackie McNamara in right midfield
complementing Paul Smith on the left, and Norrie McCathie and Andy Tod
looking solid at the heart of the defence -- certainly is working for
the East End Park side.
And with nine goals now scored in those four games, the men up front
are not doing too badly, either. The midweek Coca-Cola Cup visit to face
Hearts at Tynecastle should be interesting. As Paton said quietly: ''We
fear no-one. We always enjoy playing against Hearts.''

A SENSE of deja vu swept over me at the weekend when I saw Scottish
League secretary Peter Donald maintaining that Celtic would not be
allowed a postponement of their premier division match just 48 hours
after their European Cup-winners' Cup game.
Thirty years ago, Celtic found themselves in a similar situation when
Georgia was still a part of the Soviet Union. In a Cup-winners' Cup tie
back then, Dynamo Kiev moved the second-leg tie to Tbilisi to avoid the
cruel winter of the Ukraine.
At that time, as now, Celtic faced a marathon journey which was not
helped by an emergency landing on the journey out, and then being caught
in a blizzard in Stockholm on a re-fuelling stop on the way back.
By Friday -- 24 hours before their league game against Hearts --
Celtic were still stranded in the Swedish capital. I was there in the
airport when an impromptu board meeting, involving Sir Robert Kelly and
Desmond White, was held deciding whether or not a postponement of the
Tynecastle match should be requested.
If memory serves me correctly, Celtic opted against making an official
request, feeling, with some justification, that the Scottish League
should address the problem and come to their rescue. But the cavalry did
not arrive . . .
And so they eventually arrived home at Prestwick Airport late on
Friday night after a nightmare journey, and Jock Stein took his tired
players to Parkhead and trained them under the floodlights.
The next day they lost 3-2 and that result allowed Rangers to come
closer to them at the top of the first division. It could have cost them
their first title under Stein's management.
Now they go back to Georgia, in the same tournament, and already the
League say they won't get any postponement of their home game against
Motherwell.
Peter Donald says there is ''no precedent'' and he is right, but there
should have been one back in l966. And, in any case, things have changed
dramatically in European football and, whether the Scottish League like
it or not, they will have to change a little, too.
UEFA have decreed that the Cup-winners' Cup games must be played on a
Thursday. Last season, Dundee United were refused any postponement but
they were facing a journey back from Slovakia, considerably closer to
home than Georgia.
It seems entirely likely that, because of conditions in the former
Soviet republic, Celtic will not be able to fly home after the game.
That would mean the players facing a six-hour journey and being asked
to adjust to a four or five-hour time difference the day before their
first home game of the season.
That would be grossly unfair and the Scottish League must recognise
that.
When our clubs go into Europe, they carry the banner for the whole
country. If they find success, then that can help others avoid dangerous
preliminary-round games in future seasons.
That should be taken into consideration in this current situation. So
far Celtic have made no request for assistance. If they do so, it will
be because the club will have checked thoroughly and found out that
serious travel problems exist for them after being sent to one of
Europe's farthest outposts.
This is a severe handicap for a club who are in the competition to
represent the whole of Scotland as well as their own support.
The SFA presumably agreed to the changes proposed by UEFA, and the
League accepted that situation when it was put into operation without
the clubs being consulted.
Anyhow, haven't the League been postponing games to help the national
side in the current European Championship bid and in previous World Cup
efforts? Where is the difference?
And weren't games changed willy-nilly last season once the lucrative
television deal was signed?
Neither clubs nor fans were considered in the rush for TV money and
now one club may be penalised again, simply because they won the
Scottish Cup a few months ago and have now been unlucky enough to be
thrust into a tie thousands of miles from home.
Manager Tommy Burns and his players -- several of whom will be helping
Scotland in their European cause -- deserve more understanding in this
matter.
I am not suggesting a blanket decision from the League to cover every
Cup-winners' Cup tie in the future. What I am saying is that in
exceptional circumstances -- and few can argue that these prevail here
-- then help must be extended to clubs who find themselves in trouble.
That is simply common sense, and Peter Donald and the Scottish League
must apply a proportion of that.
Celtic have a strong case for special treatment, whether or not there
has been any precedent . . .

FIVE-YEAR-OLD Chelsea Burke, who was sent to the United States for
treatment for a brain tumour after British doctors said they could not
help her, died at home early yesterday.
Friends feared the worst after Chelsea and her parents, Steve and
Shelley, arrived quietly back in Britain from New York, where, despite
treatment, the cancer had spread to her spine and doctors realised there
was nothing more they could do.
Yesterday, Chelsea's grandmother Geraldine Burke said: ''It is with
profound sorrow and breaking heart that Steve and Shelley have to
announce that their most precious and darling daughter Chelsea died
early this Sunday morning.''
Chelsea, from Herne, Kent, first came to public attention in March
when she flew to the New York University medical centre for an operation
to remove the tumour in her brain.
Her father said at the time: ''I am not prepared to do as the British
doctors have said and sit back to watch my daughter die. We thought
there was no way she could live. But while there is hope we shall not
give up.''
The treatment, estimated to have cost more than #100,000, was in part
paid for by public donations to a special appeal fund set up for
Chelsea.

<HEADLINE>Poll spells 'grave warning' for Labour and 'snub' to Tories</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DUNCAN BLACK</BYLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday declared that the results
of a new opinion poll carried a ''grave warning'' for Labour and its
plans for a tax-raising Scottish parliament.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson retorted that the results
showed undiminished backing for devolution and were a ''snub'' to Mr
Forsyth.
The survey, by National Opinion Polls, showed 46% support for a
Scottish parliament, 30% for independence, and 21% for the status quo.
Even among Conservative voters, there was substantial support for
constitutional change, with 31% in favour of devolution and 7% for
independence. The poll, conducted for the Sunday Times Scotland, also
found that Labour has 52% support among voters, the SNP 26%,
Conservatives 13% and Liberal Democrats 8%.
The high level of support for devolution continues despite a recent
escalation of the Tory campaign against home rule in which Ministers
have focused on what they call the ''tartan tax'' -- the proposed power
to vary income tax by up to 3p in the #. But the constant attacks from
Mr Forsyth and his colleagues do seem to be having some effect on public
opinion about the taxation issue. Asked whether a Scottish parliament
should have the power to impose up to an extra 3p in the #, 42% agreed
but 47% objected.
Mr Forsyth said yesterday that, with a further 11% undecided on
taxation powers, it was clear that a majority of Scots were ''alarmed by
the tartan tax and its damaging effect on jobs and prosperity''. He
said: ''These poll results carry a grave warning for Labour and its
allies in the Scottish Constitutional Convention.''
Mr Forsyth repeated earlier Tory claims that a devolved parliament
would cost each Scottish household up to #6 a week in extra taxation
which no other part of the UK would have to pay. ''If George Robertson
truly has the interests of the Scottish people at heart, I call upon him
to abandon the tartan tax and the hardship it would create.''
The poll also showed that a majority accepted that a Scottish
parliament would mean a reduction in the number of Scots MPs at
Westminster. ''But it is at Westminster that the block grant for a
Scottish parliament would be decided,'' said Mr Forsyth. ''With reduced
influence there, Scotland could not prevent a squeezing of the block
grant in times of financial stringency, with disastrous consequences for
health, education and the other vital services, as well as an even
higher tartan tax.''
He added that the poll's finding of 13% support for the Conservatives
in Scotland represented a 2% rise. ''It is an indication that we are
beginning to get our message across, but we still have a tremendous
amount of work to do.''
For Labour, Mr Robertson said: ''The results of this poll are a
serious snub for John Major and Michael Forsyth. Their ruthless
propaganda has not dented the home rule vote. The support for Labour's
plan stands firm and secure in the face of the most vitriolic propaganda
campaign ever mounted against an idea.''
Mr Robertson added: ''Even on taxation, a question which wrongly talks
about the Scottish parliament 'imposing' tax and does not mention the
power to cut tax gets a 42% approval vote. When people realise that
there is no tartan tax and that the power to increase or cut taxation
will lie with a decision of the people, then opinion will swing on this
issue as well.
''The prevailing level of support for the Labour Party is well over
50% in Scotland in a four-party fight. That is the challenge to Michael
Forsyth and his propaganda machine. The Scots are not stupid and cannot
be conned. It is time he listened to them instead of lecturing at
them.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond also welcomed the survey results, saying:
''This is a good poll for the SNP in terms of our own support and the
strength of support for independence.'' He highlighted a specific
question which showed that nearly half the respondents felt they and
their families would be better off if England and Scotland were ruled
separately. ''We are totally satisfied that we are winning the economic
argument. It means that the Tories' economic arguments against
independence have blown up in their faces.''
Referring to the survey's finding that only a quarter of respondents
wanted Labour to win sole control of a devolved parliament, Mr Salmond
added: ''Labour's lead in Scotland is not as secure as it might seem.''
The SNP leader said the Tories' position was so weak that they could
not even persuade their former Ministers, a reference to an article
written by former Defence Minister Alan Clark in the same newspaper
yesterday. In the article, Mr Clark apparently promotes the cause of an
independent Scottish republic, although many will question the
seriousness of his support given the piece's characteristically
mischievous tone.
For the Scottish Liberal Democrats, chief executive Andy Myles last
night said: ''The poll confirms the pattern that 75% of Scots want
change and that the bulk of those want a home rule parliament. It
reaffirms our determination to make sure that the Constitutional
Convention provides a strong parliament for Scotland.''
Mr Myles believed the poll under-rated the Liberal-Democrats' support
in Scotland. ''We regularly receive more votes at the ballot-box and I
am convinced that our support is much higher than this level.''

COWAL GAMES
THE Cowal Highland Gathering retains its attractions, but not, it
seems, for track athletes. A laudable attempt to revive running events
at Saturday's annual games could not be billed a success. Performances
were above average, but given the prizes and free entry, numbers were
thin.
One of those more used to modern tartan described the sensation of the
yielding red cinders as: ''Like racing carrying a sack of tatties.''
After a gap of six years, it will take more prolonged nurturing to
revive a tradition launched in 1871.
Showpiece event in Cowal's handicap track programme was always the
3000m scratch race -- derby among the selling platers, for which enough
current and former internationalists turned out to make this the quality
race of the day.
Adrian Callan was content to sit in as clubmates John Mackay and
Graeme Wight set the pace, but when Robert Quinn made his move, breaking
clear with 800m left, Callan stuck like highland toffee, going on to win
in 8-28.21.
100m: B Holliman (Irvine, 7m) 10.9secs. 200m: A Young (Victoria Park,
15m) 22.0. Mile: G Gibson (Kilbarchan, 160m) 4-07.0. 3000m scratch: 1, A
Callan (Shetteston) 8min.28.1sec. Junior men. 100m: J Usher (Greenock
Glenpark) 11.5. 1000m: D McRae 2-51.2. Heavy events. Shot: M MacDonald
14.41m; 28lb weight: MacDonald 21.12m; hammer: MacDonald 35.50m; 56lb
weight for height: M Hunter 14ft 0ins; caber: Hunter. Overall: 1, M
McDonald (Scottish Games Association) 41 points; 2, M Hunter (Dumfries
AC) 30; 3, J Young (Irvine AC) 27; 4, W Sutherland (Connecticut) 25; 5
equal, A Pettigrew (Shettleston) and L Nisbett (Edinburgh Southern
Harriers) 22.
WORLD Highland Dancing championships -- adult winner -- Deryck
Mitchelson (Monifieth). Junior -- Natalie-Anne Hall (Ontario, Canada).
Juvenile -- Colleen Rintamaki (Ontario).
Pipe Band Chamionships : Grade 1 -- Shotts &amp; Dykehead Caledonian,
runners-up Power of Scotland. Grade 2 -- Hydro Electric Buchan, Boghall
and Bathgate Caledonian. Grade 3 -- Dumfries &amp; Galloway Constabulary.
Grade 4 -- Morpeth.

ITALIAN champions Juventus -- drawn in the same Champions' League
section as Rangers -- made an ominously impressive start to the defence
of their Serie A title with a 4-1 defeat of Cremonese yesterday.
Fabrizio Ravanelli hit two goals in five minutes midway in the second
half. Vladimir Jugovic, signed from Sampdoria, fired Juventus in front
with a solo effort in 17 minutes only for Riccardo Maspero to equalise
with a free kick in 47 minutes. Frenchman Didier Deschamps scored Juve's
fourth.
Paul Ince made his debut for Inter against Vicenza, and was thankful
for Brazilian Roberto Carlos' winner.
George Weah took just six minutes to hit a debut goal as AC Milan won
2-1 at Padova.

TOM Carbery's letter criticising Celtic's ticket distribution
arrangements could have gone further and criticised all the premier
division clubs who make their surplus tickets available to the
''marginal market'' at the stadium on the day.
Television reveals that the home sections of many of these stadiums,
when Rangers or Celtic come to visit, contain empty seats. If these
seats were made available from, say, Thursday before the game, through a
country-wide network of ticket agencies linked to a computerised on-line
booking system, then the ''marginal market'' might be tempted into
Tannadice or Tynecastle as well as Parkhead.

I, AND a good few hundred other spectators in the stand and on the
ground around the fourteenth hole in the second round of the Open,
witnessed the incident referred to in Douglas Lowe's recent article.
The point is completely missed because Jay Haas did not replace his
ball when it was knocked off the green into the bunker by Lee Trevino's
ball.
All the players and the match referee were presumably unaware of what
had happened because there was no discussion when the players reached
the green.
Much to my surprise, Trevino clearly looked at his ball, identified it
as his, and Haas duly descended into the bunker and played an immaculate
shot out. Unfortunately he missed the birdie putt.
So far as I could see no spectator or marshal said anything and all
proceeded as normal to the fifteenth tee.

Rules Corner replies: Not having been present, we stand corrected on
this point of fact. Rule 18-5 required Haas to replace the ball, but in
this case Decision 18-5/3 would free him from any penalty in not doing
so when he was unaware the ball had moved. Spectators did the American
no favour by keeping quiet.

IN REPLY to Mr Carbery's 'open letter' to Mr McCann, I have some areas
of agreement but more of disagreement.
Not being a season-ticket holder for season '94/95, I agree with his
comments as to ''bewilderment'' in trying to obtain tickets and
especially to the seat allocation system. However, these circumstances
were unique to the ''Hampden year''.
It remains to be seen as to how well the ''spare seats'' will be
allocated to non-season ticket holders -- hopefully better than the
season-ticket system (which saw my six-year-old son receive two season
tickets for two separate seat numbers!).
The comparison he makes with obtaining theatre tickets via computer is
one I've long agreed with. Though Mr Carbery should note that Celtic
have had a city-centre outlet for tickets in their Dundas Street shop
since at least November '94.
In general, I don't think that Celtic supporters want to be seen by
the club as customers, but as fans, who are the club's first concern.
As there hasn't been a ''run-of-the-mill'' game at Celtic Park (not
Parkhead) to date, how can Mr Carbery ''compare the disparate
arrangements'' with obtaining theatre tickets?
As for his comments regarding Mrs McCann getting tickets in disguise,
as she is several months pregnant, the disguise, like the suggestion,
would be useless.
Surely Mr Carbery should take into account: a) What the new board, in
the most difficult of circumstances, after just over a year have
achieved; b) The most successful share issue in British football, #17m
new stand, etc; c) What time will tell as to the allocation to fans of
non-season ticket seats, at the new Celtic Park; d) That he should get
off Tommy Burns' back to get on with the job he knows best.

WHILE at Rangers' European tie at Ibrox, I was both disappointed and
disgusted with the attitude of many of the so-called Rangers supporters.
It was not the best performance by the team, but they could not have
been helped by the torrents of verbal abuse given by many of the
''fans''.
Surely when things are not going as well as they might, that is when
the supporters need to get behind the team instead of getting on top of
them and consequently giving the opposition encouragement.
Hopefully, now that Rangers are in the Champions' League, these
''fans'' will indeed support the team and not continue with this
disgraceful behaviour.

I READ the article by Jack McLean, of August 14, and in one respect,
when he speaks about the ''Celtic sports'', he is totally wrong.
My group had travelled from Brittany to attend the World Pipe Band
Championship with great expectations and had expected to see a
manifestation of Scottish culture at its best. The piping was indeed
superb as was the dancing, but what can be said about that travesty of
sport: ''the strong men''?
At our events in Brittany we also include strength competitions but
the contests are in traditional sports, unlike this strange exhibition
which was presented to us as sport. Where were the magnificent hammer
throwers I had hoped to see, why was there no cabe,r and, above all,
where were the kilts?
What are we in Brittany, or from any foreign countries, to think of
Scottish Sports Culture after this, when so many other nations now work
to preserve their traditional sports. Have the Scots already given up?

SWIMMING ain't what it used to be. A trip to the baths used to mean
changing in seriously segregated rooms, in fairly grim surroundings with
Victorian tiles on the walls and stern attendants marching round
watching your every move.
Now the choice of water activities is so much wider and the emphasis
is on fun.
Swimming has always been a sport for all and the children are still
there, as are the old men. Last week, I saw a 79-year-old woman wearing
water wings in the pool as she began the learning process.
Part of the sport's charm is that, unlike many others, you can start
as a baby and continue till old age. But the facilities and scope have
moved on dramatically and some may feel the pendulum has swung too far.
There are many pools where the emphasis appears to have been taken
away from serious swimming. They have fancy names, wave machines and
imitation rapids, slides, and flumes.
While children, and many adults, may love these theme pools, to others
who want to practise their stroke they are anathema. And the money spent
on these facilities, as opposed to Olympic-length pools, has done
nothing to advance the cause of competition swimming at an international
level.
Britain's record in last week's European championships in Vienna was,
at best, uninspiring. Two silver medals and a collection of bronzes is
not something to cheer about.
However, there was jubilation for Scot Graeme Smith who came second in
the 1500 metres freestyle yesterday, setting a Scottish record in the
process.
Many British swimmers might envy the fame of 17-year-old German
champion Franzi van Almsick, who scooped handfuls of gold medals at the
games. She is well known, is a heroine of the young, and has her own
television show.
Advertising contracts have made her a multi-millionairess. She appears
to thrive on controversy and last week apparently said Hitler was one of
her favourite historical figures. One Viennese newspaper advised her to
''swim but don't talk.''
But why is the standard in Britain, and particularly Scotland, so
disappointing at international level?
Jim Park is part-time Scottish coach and he lays the blame at three
key areas. The facilities are not nearly good enough, swimmers don't get
enough access to pools, and there are no full-time professional coaches.
''I've just come back from the Canadian championships in Winnipeg,''
he said. ''In relative terms that's the backwoods and yet there were two
50-metre pools side by side there. Yet there are only two in the whole
of Scotland and indeed, only eight in Britain.''
Money problems also keep swimmers back.
''Rugby is finding a way to pay players and, in athletics, the sums
are astronomical. Yet swimmers in this country can't afford to swim
full-time,'' he says.
Yet he is optimistic. ''We have taken a long, hard look at ourselves
and there has been a shake-up which has brought a more streamlined
set-up all the way down to the grassroots.
''With the arrival of Martin Woodruff as director of coaching, things
have begun to take off. We have set up a four-year programme focused on
the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. Indeed we have already
set the times for qualifying.''
At the last Games in Victoria, there were only 10 Scottish
competitors. There was an allocation for 14, but only 10 managed to make
the times. Jim Park believes that the same criteria should apply for the
games in Malaysia.
Who knows, by 1998 we might have a Scottish swimmer in the bad books
for calling the Duke of Cumberland their favourite historical figure.

CITY of Glasgow AC, who defeated their rivals Edinburgh Woollen Mill
in the United Kingdom Women's League, maintained their superiority over
the Edinburgh club when retaining the Monklands Scottish Cup title at
Coatbridge.
Susan Freebairn won the discus with a throw of 44.70m ahead of
internationalist Helen Cowe (Aberdeen), who reached 43.72m. Sheila
Fairweather took the 3000 metres in 10min 8.0sec and schools sprint
champion Gillian Hegney won the 100m in 12.1sec.
Edinburgh's best performances came from Mary McClung, who recorded a
middle-distance double with wins in the 800 (2-15.2) and 1500 (4-55.4),
Helen McCreadie in the hammer (44.92m), and Lorna Jackson, javelin
(50.94m).
* LOCHABER ''Iron Man'' John Brooks, who trains on Ben Nevis,
celebrated his twentieth birthday yesterday by finishing seventh in a
12-kilometre run up the Matterhorn in Switzerland.
Brooks, who just missed out on a place in Scotland's team for the
World Mountain Trophy in Edinburgh in two weeks' time, was first Briton
home in the International Matterhorn Lauf from Zermatt won by Columbia,
with Britain third behind Germany.

yesterday.
Sigmatic was the seventeen-strong Sigma 33 Class's top performer with
a first on Saturday and a second behind Simon Pender in St Joan
yesterday.
With the breeze gusting regularly to over 40 knots, the brand new
Hunter 707, after taking second on Saturday lost its mast yesterday,
while Angus Spence's First Class 8, The Black Pig, won on Saturday in
the Sportboat class, but could not complete yesterday's contest when
cracks appeared in their mast.
Jim Donaldson in Tunnock's Teacake, the Melges 24, won the Sportboat
class yesterday.
On the first day of the Brut British Olympic trials at Weymouth there
were two encouraging results for the Scottish contingent seeking
selection to go to Savannah next year.
Shirley Robertson sailed to her top-ranked seeding in the Europe
class, but Ayrshire's Adrian Jones, fresher in the fleet after
converting to the Olympic class, won the first race and placed fourth in
the second to share the overall lead.

UEFA look certain to win the power struggle with FIFA to have a
greater say in governing the game. UEFA president Lennart Johannson has
been rallying substantial support for his radical proposals.
The main aim of the dynamic Swede is to create a more democratic
process involving four confederations -- America, Europe, Africa, and
Asia and Oceania, who will amalgamate.
Each would in turn have their representative elected to head FIFA for
a four-year period.
This proposal has wide appeal, as the various confederations have
complained in the past that they do not have the clout to make changes,
as this requires more than 75% of votes within FIFA.
The autocratic rule of FIFA president Joao Havelange is also under
fire. He refused to meet with Johannson to discuss his plans last week
at the bash to open Belgium's replacement stadium for the ill-fated
Heysel.
Johansson has accused the ageing Brazilian consistently of
under-valuing the television rights for the World Cup Finals. Already
UEFA generate more from the Champions' League than the #22m FIFA will
receive from the next World Cup Finals in France.
To underline that point he revealed that a consortium involving
sporting entrepreneur Mark McCormack and the German company UFA, have
offered #550m for the television rights to the event in 2002.
* SERIE A commenced yesterday, with the three main protagonists for
the championship, Juventus, AC Milan, and Parma, all making a
satisfactory start.
Roberto Baggio is in no doubt that he made the right move from
Juventus to Milan, who won 2-1 at Padova. He revealed: ''The talent is
here to help me realise my last ambition -- to play in the Champions'
League and win it.''
That hope may rest on the man-management skills of coach Fabio Capello
to blend the qualities of Baggio with George Weah and Paulo Futre, his
other new acquisitions.
Hristo Stoichkov has made an electrifying start at Parma, who drew 1-1
at Atalanta. Coach Nevia Scala is certain his arrival will take the club
to new heights. ''For the first time ever, the title will be won by a
team from the provinces,'' he said. ''Stoichkov is a truly brilliant
player who will take us to another level.''
Juventus effortlessly beat Cremonese 4-1 at home to demonstrate the
threat they pose to Rangers in the Champions' League.
* IN THE wake of their European Cup defeat -- the first time
Anderlecht have failed to be represented in the first round in 33 years
-- problems continue to beset the stricken Belgian club. The veteran
Raymond Goethals will quit after tomorrow's Brussels derby with FC
Bruges after barely a week in the job.
Anderlecht also may be without their best player, Gills de Bilde, who
spent a night in jail for an attack on a male nurse and vandalising an
ambulance. The incident occurred when he was refused permission to
travel in the ambulance with his father, who had suffered a stroke.
If Anderlecht lose the derby, their prospects of maintaining their
monopoly of the championship will be even more remote.
Two other Belgian coaches have been dismissed -- Jean Thissen
(Seraing) and Walter Meeuws (Ghent).
* THE arrival of coloured striker Freddy Rincon at Real Madrid has
sparked off racial demonstrations, and the Bernebeu Stadium has been
daubed with slogans against his signing. Rincon says if the hate
campaign continues, he will seek to end his contract with the Spanish
champions.
* RENE Notten, coach of Aruba and a former FC Twente Enschede player,
has died from a heart attack.

THE Melrose gamble of playing two backs, Ross Brown and Rowen
Shepherd, in their forward trio paid handsome dividends as the
Greenyards club captured the CIS Insurance Selkirk Sevens trophy for the
first time since 1988 with a runaway 55-12 margin over Kelso in the
final.
Brown and Shepherd not only adapted to the role of ball providers with
more commitment than at the Kelso tournament six days previously but
also provided an additional cutting edge to a Melrose back division
strike force, each of whom was capable of scoring from long range.
Shepherd scored four tries and Brown a fine support effort in the final.
It must have been thoroughly heartening also for Scotland's new
selection chairman, Jim Telfer, to note the sharpness and ball skills of
the Melrose backs. In providing a splendid lead as captain, Graham Shiel
looked stronger and quicker in running in nine cracking tries and Craig
Chalmers was eager, positive, and a creative master of scoring pass
delivery.
There was, too, a tour de force by Gary Parker, who displayed all his
cheeky skills of deception and some impressive goal-kicking (all
conversions with drop kicks nowadays) for the top-scoring spot, with
five tries and 17 conversions for 59 of the massive Melrose haul of 159
points in four ties.
Kelso had put together some sparkling passages in registering 77
points while disposing of Langholm, then of the pacy Waterloo.
They owed much to the power play of their captain, Stewart Bennett, in
ball-winning and in thunderous running. And they had a livewire scrum
half in Graeme Cowe, who was their top try-scorer with five.
Kelso were unfortunate, however, to lose, after the first round, their
orchestra leader and goal-kicker, Graeme Aitchison, with a dead leg.
Although they recovered from a 10-point deficit to finish the stronger
in eliminating Jed-Forest in the semi-final with a clinching late try
and conversion by Adam Roxburgh, they were 31-5 down to Melrose at the
changeover in the final and just could not keep the door closed against
a blizzard of Melrose handling and running at pace.
Parker had a field day, with four tries and five conversions, and
other Melrose tries were by Shiel (2), Derek Bain, Chalmers, and Brown.
Gordon Laing's try and conversion, plus a penalty try, were scant
conciliation for a Kelso seven lacking the midfield incisiveness at the
Melrose command.
Jed-Forest had reached a peak of performance in eliminating a
much-favoured Gala side, packed with pace, by 29-22 in a cut-and-thrust
quarter-final. David Forster exhibited high work rate for Jed and Clark
Laidlaw showed skills and resolution for long associated with his famous
father, Roy. The crucial Jed try against Gala was by Michael Yule, who
just would not be denied even by a momentary stumble just short of the
promised land.
Gala had flattered to deceive with seven tries in the demolition of
Newcastle-Gosforth, but Craig Townsend, brother of Gregor, made some
impact with five tries and five conversions in just two ties.
London Scottish appeared a well-balanced outfit, with frontal power
and clever support running especially from Gavin Thompson, formerly of
Harlequins. But they badly missed, in the semi-final, the authority and
influence of David Millard, and his superb cover tackling that had
prevented three Selkirk tries in the quarter-final. They were put to the
sword by Melrose, Shiel and Shepherd each running in three tries.
Results:
First round -- Gala 43, Newcastle-Gosforth 5; Jed-Forest 19, Peebles
5; Kelso 41, Langholm 5; Waterloo 27, Stirling County 17; London
Scottish 43, Hawick YM 0; Selkirk 15, Wigton 5; Melrose 26, Wakefield
14; Hawick 31, Edinburgh Borderers 17.
Quarter-final -- Jed-Forest 29, Gala 22; Kelso 36, Waterloo 19; London
Scottish 19, Selkirk 17; Melrose 29, Hawick 0.
Semi-final -- Kelso 28, Jed-Forest 15; Melrose 49, London Scottish 5.
Final -- Melrose 55, Kelso 12.
Melrose -- D Bain, C Chalmers, A Shiel, captain, G Parker; R Shepherd,
S Scott, R Brown.
Kelso -- D Baird, R Laing, G Laing, G Cowe; R Bennett, captain, K
Hendry, A Roxburgh.

Melrose 19, London Scottish 10
HAIL the new 15-a-side season! Despite mighty endeavour Melrose and
London Scottish were unable to fashion a match of exciting continuity
and riveting play but rather one of error-strewn and fractured action in
which there were 11 cases of player replacement, some for injury, but
most apparently by mutual agreement to give more players a taste of the
action at Greenyards.
Both sides held to fairly predictable strategies with midfield
defences generally watertight, much ball return to the forwards, and
wings having to forage for opportunity. There was, too, a marked absence
of fast recycled ball because of bodies on the floor.
Melrose produced the higher quality of lineout possession, especially
from Ewan Simpson, and Robbie Brown led some exhilarating charges. But
although Craig Chalmers sought to ring the changes, Melrose were unable
to finish what they started. However, Gary Parker supplied some choice
items, especially in running cover.
Perhaps most encouraging was the form of Rowen Shepherd at full back
-- sound under high ball, aggressive in counterattack, and with at least
one memorable sinking of a charging Bob Bishop.
The exiles were unlucky to lose after 56 minutes, with knee damage,
their blind-side flanker Max Duthie, who had a busy workrate, and they
didn't quite match Melrose in the use of driving detached forwards. John
Steele, formerly of Northampton, had some neat touches but looked short
of sharp pace.
Yet the exiles stepped up the tempo markedly in the last 10 minutes to
fashion a splendid try.
They might have had another when Graham Shiel, for once, missed a
tackle on Ewan Ferguson.
He had scored that London Scottish try when the exiles won three
stoppage balls in a row before Ferguson waltzed inside and threw three
tackles.
Steele converted, having earlier kicked a penalty goal for a ruck
offence.
Parker potted four penalty goals and converted Jimmy Turnbull's try,
which had its origin in a Simpson lineout delivery, a thrust by the
detached Chris Davies, and Turnbull showing that he has lost none of his
sizzle off the mark.
Melrose -- R J S Shepherd; D C Bain, J G L Turnbull, A G Shiel, G A
Parker; C M Chalmers, G L Haldane; M Browne, S Scott, K R Allan, R
Brown, E M Simpson, C R Davies, S Aitken, G Inglis. Replacements: A
Redburn for Bain (31 minutes); S J Brotherstone for Scott (56); D Lunn
for Allan (56); A Purves for Redburn (65); B Hogg for Davies (66).
London Scottish -- N Robinson; E Ferguson, G Thompson, M Sly, M Kemp;
J Steele, A Devlin; S Anderson, L M Mair, A Burnell, D Johnstone, D
Orr-Ewing, M Duthie, R Bishop, S Holmes. Replacements: D McGavin for
Mair (40); S Burnell for Johnston (40); C Carson for Orr-Ewing (40); D
Rowlands for Holmes (40); A Robinson for P Burnell (56), I Neary for
Duthie (56).
Referee -- A Lyall (Gala).

THE intensity with which clubs are approaching next Saturday's
kick-off of the Tennents Premiership was revealed at New Anniesland.
Fifteen minutes into a ''friendly'' between Glasgow Accies and Dundee
HSFP, the referee had to call the captains together and demand a cooler
approach.
Accies, who won 39-20, were already ahead thanks to a try by one of
the brothers Steve and Matt Begley, whose arrival from Blackheath has
taken the pack into a new dimension.
Dundee have the problems of the loss of leading points-kicker Jonathon
Newton and the disappearance of their three top props. Last week Danny
Herrington told the club that, like John Manson and Tom Smith, he will
be playing elsewhere.

THE news that the game is now professional means that there will be a
few nervous little souls on the SRU committee twitching at the very real
possibility that professionalism renders them surplus to requirements.
Immediately!
If the game is to become professional, and if it is to make strides
forward into a new era, then -- whereas Will Carling blasted some
flatulence in the direction of the RFU ''Famous 57'' -- the 15-strong
body that comprises the SRU committee can rightfully expect that calls
will be made to replace them with one administrator.
But it goes deeper than that, too. I have a friend involved in club
rugby who has said for some time that the day the game becomes
professional, he will consider withdrawing his services. At the moment
he will happily run up hundreds of pounds of his home phone bill on club
duty, man the bar, take calls from whingeing players at work, drive
players around the country, sit at endless meetings, and carry the
sponge on to the pitch if needed. He might not want to do that if the
players get paid, and I see that kind of thinking having a massive
effect on rugby in Scotland, which is still based on the goodwill of
many clubs that are run like family units.
That's at the lower level, and in the rarefied atmosphere that is made
up of international players and the SRU I can see that relations between
the players and the SRU will deteriorate.
I can reveal, for instance, that Jeremy Richardson and Rob Wainwright
are the ''leaders'' of the squad at the moment and they are thinking
long and hard about their strategy. Today's meeting with Ian McLauchlan
will no doubt sort some of it out but I understand, and believe, that
the whole squad is in agreement that they will not be bullied into
signing contracts with the SRU that are not to their liking.
Richardson, who is a hard-headed businessman and a director of Noble
and Co, the stockbrokers, in Edinburgh, is not a man I would like to
have at the other end of the negotiating table from me.
Jim Telfer, the new manager, is the man the Union will be looking to
for signatures on bits of paper, but I cannot but help think that the
new breed of rugby player is far more ''mercenary'' and street-wise.
You see, I don't think that a threat to drop the whole of the national
squad, should they refuse to sign a bit of paper, would have much of an
effect on the current crop, who know -- and they are right in this --
that outside the top team there isn't a lot to choose from. There aren't
many threats that would work with this lot.
For instance, the SRU are bound to stipulate that any players wanting
the benefit of being paid by the union have to have some limit put on
them as far as playing club rugby outside Scotland.
Yet I see problems arising at club level.
Jimmy Martin, the GHK president, told me yesterday that he welcomed
the clarification from the IB. ''We accept what the IB have said. That
is modern rugby.'' he said. ''We will examine our position over the
coming weeks. We at GHK will definitely go along with it.''
Now, I actually believe that many clubs who operate some pretty
dastardly slush funds at the moment will realise that they have the
wherewithal and money to put what they have been doing for some time
through the books. I know that GHK, for one, like Glasgow Accies, West,
and Glasgow Southern, will now be looking at methods other than slush
funds or trust funds to pay players, and that may well mean the rapid
placement of players, and coaches, on to a payroll.
And the total effect of it all is that the clubs, who have a
day-to-day contact with their players and I am sure will be able to pay
their players very soon, will become more powerful than the districts
unless the latter get their act together.
If all of this talk of money, and the latent greed that will abound,
doesn't bankrupt the game in the short term, then rugby is set to
burgeon in the long term. Not rugby union. And not rugby league. Just a
game called rugby with as few dammed committees as possible.

ALL Black star Jonah Lomu was punched and jostled by spectators at a
provincial match on Saturday.
Lomu's team, Counties, had beaten Canterbury 41-39 in the North Island
town of Pukekohe when a punch was thrown by a spectator as the giant
winger left the field.
Lomu, a target of a string of English rugby league clubs until he
announced his intention to remain in rugby union, was caught a glancing
blow. A second spectator attempted to tackle Lomu but witnesses said he
bounced off. Now his team are considering giving Lomu protection at
matches.

AXA EQUITY AND LAW SUNDAY LEAGUE
LEADERS Kent kept their AXA Equity and Law Sunday League title hopes
alive with a 21-run victory over Essex at Canterbury.
Chasing 222 to win, the visitors looked well on course at 175 for
three but collapsed and lost their last seven wickets for 25 runs in
five overs.
The dismissal of Nasser Hussain, who made a Sunday-best 83, was
crucial to Kent's success, and started the Essex slump.
Martin McCague was the pick of the Kent bowlers, trapping Mark Waugh
(51) and Graham Gooch on his way to claiming five for 41.
Worcestershire climbed up to second place with a two-run win -- their
fourth in a row -- over title rivals Warwickshire at New Road.
Tim Curtis made 62 as Worcestershire posted 157 for seven, then Phil
Newport and Tom Moody grabbed three wickets apiece as the visitors were
restricted to 155 for eight in reply.
It was Warwickshire's first limited-overs defeat after 14 successive
victories.
England pace bowler Peter Martin took four for 29 as Lancashire
maintained their title challenge with a 15-run win over Hampshire at
Portsmouth.
Bottom-of-the-table Hampshire looked set for victory when they reached
125 for three, needing 72 for victory from 13 overs.
But Martin ripped out the middle order and Hampshire fell away,
closing on 181 for seven.
Martin's former Test colleague Darren Gough posted his best Sunday
return of the season at Headingley where Yorkshire defeated Middlesex by
18 runs.
The England paceman marked his return to action in the competition
after injury by taking four for 35 as Middlesex were dismissed for 143
in reply to Yorkshire's 161 for eight in a contest reduced to 37 overs a
side by rain.
Australian star Michael Bevan hit a superb 81 and took three for 35 to
clinch Yorkshire's victory.
Teenager Owais Shah kept Middlesex's hopes alive with 64 from 89
deliveries but received little from his team-mates, and Middlesex, who
are going so well in the county championship, continue to struggle when
it comes to the one-day code.
Big-hitting Gloucestershire batsman Andrew Symonds blasted Glamorgan
to a six-wicket defeat at Abergavenny.
Gloucestershire, replying to the home side's 153, lost two wickets for
23 runs in nine overs before Symonds tucked into the Glamorgan attack.
Symonds, who hit a first-class record sixteen 6s in an innings in the
county championship match, was back on the big-hitting trail again
yesterday.
He smacked Steve Barwick, the Sunday League's top wicket-taker, for
four 6s in one over and smashed him for a total of 49 runs from four
overs.
Symonds completed his first Sunday League half-century before he was
dismissed for 69, which came off just 39 deliveries, as Gloucestershire
cruised home.
Adrian Rollins, whose previous Sunday best was 57, smashed an unbeaten
126 as Derbyshire overcame Surrey in a game reduced by showers.
Rollins cracked his ton off just 68 balls after Derbyshire had been
set a reduced target of 249 in 37 overs.
Surrey's innings was built on a stand of 190 in 25 overs between
Darren Bicknell (91) and Nadeem Shahid (101).
A third-wicket stand of 124 between Peter Bowler and Piran Holloway
helped Somerset to a thrilling four-wicket win over Leicestershire at
Weston-super-Mare with just two balls to spare.
But the home side needed a rapid 22 off 10 balls from Mushtaq Ahmed to
secure victory after Leicestershire had made 232 for seven, thanks
largely to Ben Smith's sparkling 115.
A third-wicket stand of 158 between Richard Johnson and Chris Cairns
helped Nottinghamshire to a seven-wicket success at Northampton.
Johnson was unbeaten on 136 while Cairns made 70 as the visitors
reached their target with 6.4 overs to spare.
Earlier, Richard Montgomerie, Mal Loye, and Rob Bailey all had cracked
half-centuries for Northants.
Durham's game with Sussex at Hartlepool was washed out with the
visitors on 89 for three after 14.2 overs.

THE SIXTH TEST:
A RESPLENDENT sixth-wicket partnership of just under 200 runs between
Carl Hooper and Shivnarine Chanderpaul enabled West Indies to amass
their highest total against England and took the final Test into the
last day with distinct possibilities of an enthralling finish to a
memorable series.
England, with all second-innings wickets intact, need a further 199
runs to avoid an innings defeat. But on a wicket which has remained true
for four days, they should bat well enough to see the series end level
at 2-2.
The tourists resumed yesterday on a massive 424 for four, but their
captain, Richie Richardson, clearly intent on keeping the scoring
momentum going, which they had achieved so effortlessly against the
England bowling on the previous day, had added just six to his overnight
score of 87 when he fell as early as the third over.
Angus Fraser had bowled only the first over of the day, when Dominic
Cork took over, and in his opening over, Richardson played a square cut
to a ball that wasn't all that short, and Graeme Hick at gully threw
himself to the left to clutch the ball with both hands.
It seemed that West Indies' hopes of piling on the runs with quick
scoring would diminish, with just Hooper and Chanderpaul remaining of
their specialist batsmen.
But both seemed keen to end this magnificent series with a flourish --
Hooper, because his injury prevented him from playing in the last Test
at Trent Bridge and prior to that his contribution had been modest, and
Chanderpaul, because he was given his chance in this series only in the
previous Test because of Hooper's absence.
There was no lack of zest in their endeavour as they took the
opportunity to make their mark. During the partnership spanning nearly
two sessions, they gave a superb display of strokes.
Devon Malcolm, whose dropped catch from Hooper off his own bowling on
Saturday had proved so highly expensive, had another chance wasted,
albeit difficult, when Hick was unable to accept a sharp, low catch at
second slip.
Hooper was 19 then and a little shaky, particularly after the next
ball hit him hard and square on the helmet just above the forehead.
Malcolm followed that with a bouncer, but that was the extent of his
aggression for most of the day.
England's bowling made little impression on the two Guyanese batsmen
as they drove, cut, and pulled shots almost at will.
Hooper's 50 came from 109 balls immediately after lunch, which was
taken with West Indies on 520 for five, and Chanderpaul's followed not
much later off 91 deliveries.
The century mark for Hooper was a lot faster, with the second 50
taking just 48 deliveries. His wide range of strokes was in evidence in
one particular over from Watkinson when he hit the off-spinner to
mid-wicket for 4, lifted the next ball for 6 over mid-on, and followed
it with two runs to third man from a deft, late cut.
Earlier, he had put a ball from Fraser straight over the bowler's head
into the pavilion balcony.
Chanderpaul matched Hooper's stroke-play, showing excellent timing in
his shots. He used his feet well to Watkinson, and drove with style and
ease on either side of the wicket.
Their sixth-wicket partnership fell just four short of 200 and was a
record at The Oval in a Test between these two sides.
It ended with Chanderpaul driving Cork uppishly to extra cover, and
Gallian took the catch. With the last ball before tea, Malcolm found the
outside edge of Hooper's bat, and the tourists were 653 for seven, a
lead of 199.
The declaration came an hour later on 692 for eight, which is the
second highest -- behind Pakistan's 708 -- in England by any team since
the war.
In just over an hour's batting, England, 238 behind on the first
innings, had reduced the deficit by 39 without loss.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES:
THE row over allegations that Aberdeenshire ducked out of a fixture
with West Lothian at Boghall on August 12 should finally have ended
yesterday, when the re-arranged fixture was due to be played on the
orders of the Scottish County Cricket Board.
But reports of ''new evidence'' being available not only caused a
further postponement of the game, but also has prompted a meeting of the
Scottish County Cricket Board to be held at The Arns, Alloa, on
Wednesday.
The trouble began when Aberdeenshire, who had several top players
unavailable, turned up with only seven players at Boghall. Four others
were stranded when their hired car broke down at Stonehaven.
The Scottish Counties board, at a specially convened meeting, cleared
the Mannofield side of purposely avoiding the game, and ordered it to be
played yesterday.
The Mannofield side's game against Ayrshire at Prestwick was rained
off on Saturday, but West Lothian got much the better of the draw in
terms of points against Forfarshire at Forthill.
They made 194 for nine, with Ian Beven hitting a half-century, Bryce
Robertson taking four wickets, and Barry Stewart three. Paul Crosse's
three for 16 had Forfarshire struggling to make 101 for eight -- and the
umpires penalised them five points for a slow over rate.
Jon Taylor top-scored with 94 as Stirling County defeated neighbours
Clackmannan County by 101 runs at Williamfield -- Bruce Russell taking
seven for 42.
Steve Blackie's three for 15 and Andy Monteith's three for 27 were the
main reasons for Fifeshire making only 94 against Strathmore at Lochside
Park. Fifeshire's poor performance was emphasised when Strathie raced to
95 without loss.
And Arbroath County, thanks to 60 from Kevin Ritchie and five wickets
from Barry McGill, defeated Perthshire by nine wickets.

DAMON Hill's dream of winning the world drivers' championship faded
yesterday as Michael Schumacher claimed victory in a controversial and
enthralling Belgian Grand Prix.
Hill snatched second place from Martin Brundle after having received a
crucial 10-second penalty, though it was the vagaries of the Ardennes
weather that had a dramatic effect on the outcome.
There was also added tension when the result was confirmed only after
the Williams team saw a protest over Schumacher's driving behaviour
rejected by the race stewards. The team had complained that Schumacher
zig-zagged excessively and that the rivals' cars also touched as Hill
attempted on several occasions to get past.
But the defeat means that Schumacher, who won after having started the
race from sixteenth place on the grid, now leads his title rival by 15
points with just six races left.
The defeat came at the end of easily the most exciting race of the
campaign, with the lead fluctuating as rapidly as the changing weather
before Schumacher triumphed by nearly 20 seconds.
The German's gamble on staying on slick tyres when rain first appeared
paid off, as Hill was forced into the pits five times, most crucially on
the last occasion when he collected a 10-second penalty.
Hill had taken advantage of the safety car surprisingly being sent out
to erase a 30-second deficit, but as soon as it left the track, he was
handed a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, which ended any hopes of
victory. However, he took second spot on the final lap from Brundle
after having emerged from his enforced stop 11 seconds adrift of his
fellow Briton's Ligier.
''It was a shame,'' moaned Hill. ''It would have been a great finish
otherwise, because I was right behind Michael and we had 14 laps left.
''I know there have to be regulations, but some common sense should be
used. I was only a few kilometres an hour over the limit.
''I knew I had to get past Martin, because I needed those extra two
points for finishing second. It was that kind of race -- had it stayed
raining I would have been a hero.''
Brundle, disappointed at dropping to third place, said: ''I would have
liked to have got in between the two championship contenders. I just
wish they'd run into each other a bit harder!
''I tried to make it as difficult for Damon as I could, but his car
was just too quick and I was very surprised to see the safety car out.
But it was a great race.
''It's a fantastic experience to drive a Formula One car in changing
conditions and on such a fantastic circuit. I wish I could do it again
straight away.''
Hill, who began from eighth place, looked set for victory after he
grabbed the lead when team-mate David Coulthard suffered engine trouble
after 14 laps.
''It is disappointing for me and the team,'' said Coulthard, who has
been axed by Williams for next season. ''I had time in hand and was
confident, but again just did not finish.
''I saw some oil coming from the car after about six laps. It cleared
up, but maybe it pumped the oil out of the gearbox and it eventually
overheated.''
Hill lost the advantage when he made his scheduled pit-stop for fresh
fuel and rubber, but quickly regained it when Schumacher went into the
pits. But Hill found himself adrift again when he decided to change to
wet-weather tyres as rain came, before using his greater grip finally to
re-overtake Schumacher after their controversial battle.
Schumacher was soon back in front as the track quickly dried. Hill
opted to change back to slicks, only for the rain to return within
moments of his pit stop. That should have given Schumacher a clear
victory until the unexpected appearance of the safety car allowed Hill
to reduce the gap and set up an exciting finale. But then the pit-lane
penalty was imposed.
The start had been no less dramatic, with birthday boy Gerhard Berger
seeing Ferrari team-mate Jean Alesi and Johnny Herbert storm past him.
Herbert grabbed the lead from Alesi, lost it a lap later, but took over
again when Alesi went into the pits and quickly retired with suspension
problems.
But the Benetton driver could not hold off the attentions of
Coulthard, who swept past him when he spun. A later spin dropped him
further down the order to finish seventh, while Mclaren's Mark Blundell
was fifth.

EAST LEAGUE:
FRASER Watts, just turned 16, was thrilled to have been called up for
first-team duty, especially since the match was going Carlton's way.
They had dismissed Royal High for 119 and a mere 30 runs were required
for victory with nine wickets in hand.
The visitors' professional, Pakistani Test player Manzoor Elahi, dug
deep for one last effort to turn the tide. Suddenly three wickets went
down for six runs.
No need yet to pad up, thought the lad who was listed to come in at
No.10. The 100 was posted, only 20 needed, but immediately two more
wickets fell. Eleven short of the target and another two dropped,
requiring the boy to walk out and face an internationally experienced
bowler, with seven wickets under his belt and the scent of blood.
With incredible coolness, the youngster tamed the bowling as he and
his partner nursed the score ever closer to the target. Up charged the
pro, the ball was short enough and wide enough, and the boy cut it to
the boundary for the winning runs.
Later, as he sat in the dressing-room savouring the moment, there was
a knock on the door and there stood the Pakistani star. Warmly he
congratulated the lad, wished him well and graciously presented him with
a pair of batting gloves.
While his colleague Hugh Parker, Carlton president, was contemplating
a distinguished contribution to the game from which he retired on
Saturday, this highly talented youngster looks to have a glittering
career ahead of him and is set to join the Durham Cricket School to
develop his skills.
Elsewhere, Stenhousemuir's failure to get the better of Corstophine at
The Tryst scuppered their chance of pipping Watsonians for the crucial
fifth position, despite the latter's defeat by champions Heriot's at
Goldenacre.
At Falkland, Edinburgh Academicals gained the better of a drawn match,
while at nearby Freuchie, big innings from Peter Steindl (91) and Alec
Davies (70) generated a final win for Grange.

ENGLISH COUNTIES
LEADERS Middlesex took a step closer to the Britannic Assurance County
Championship title as spinners John Emburey and Phil Tufnell forced
Yorkshire to follow on 266 behind at Headingley.
Only skipper Martyn Moxon stood firm with a defiant 104 as Emburey
(five for 75) and Tufnell (three for 68) dismissed the hosts for 250 --
the last seven wickets yielding just 40 runs.
Tufnell, left out of the England side at The Oval, then claimed both
wickets to fall in the second innings as Yorkshire reached 179 for two
by the close of the third day, with Moxon again impressing before he was
out for 78.
Third-placed Northants were in record-breaking batting form against
Nottinghamshire as Russell Warren, with his maiden first-class century,
Allan Lamb, and Alan Fordham all reached three figures at Northampton.
Warren (154), Lamb (115), and Fordham (130) boosted Northants to a
mammoth 709 for seven -- the county's highest total in first-class
cricket.
It surpassed their 636 for six against Essex at Chelmsford in 1990 and
was the most runs ever scored by any side against Notts.
It was also the biggest championship total of the season to date, and
with a lead of 182, Northants still have hopes of victory to keep their
title challenge alive.
Second-placed Warwickshire's bid to keep up with Middlesex was checked
by an unbeaten 70 from Steve Rhodes as Worcestershire were assisted by
rain and bad light at Edgbaston.
The former England wicketkeeper lifted his side to 325 for nine and
they will resume today with a lead of 40.
Kent slumped to defeat by an innings and 12 runs inside three days
against Essex at Canterbury despite a superb innings by Aravinda de
Silva.
The Sri Lankan made 95 off 96 balls before he was trapped leg before
by Graham Gooch, the first of two wickets for one run in 11 balls by the
former England skipper.

HOT-TEMPERED Russian Dainius Bauba was red-carded as Paisley Pirates
were denied a well-deserved victory at Whitley Warriors last night.
Bauba, who hit six goals as Paisley beat Blackburn Hawks 12-5 on
Saturday, was sent-off for fighting early in the first period on
Tyneside but his colleagues dug deep to go 4-2 ahead.
Warriors hit back to level at 5-5 at the end of the second only to see
Vas Vasilenko fire a sixth for Pirates with 10 minutes left.
But English international Dave Longstaff equalised two minutes later
to earn Warriors a 6-6 draw.
Returning hero Ronnie Plumb looked on as under-strength Fife Flyers
routed Murrayfield Royals 14-3 in their Benson &amp; Hedges Cup opener at
Kirkcaldy on Saturday.
The Canadian, who steered Flyers to their only British Championship
triumph 10 years ago, will, hopefully, get the clearance to take over as
head coach this week.
The Royals crashed to a second successive Benson &amp; Hedges Cup defeat
last night, 14-6 at Blackburn.
New head coach Jim Lynch watched his Dumfries Vikings cruise to a 16-3
Autumn Trophy win over Billingham.

COLLINGTREE SENIORS
FORMER Ryder Cup star Neil Coles fired a four-under-par final round of
68 to win the Collingtree Seniors Championship for the second time at
Northampton.
The 60-year-old totalled 211, five under par, to collect his ninth
senior title in 10 years, after scorching to the turn in a five-under 31
with just 13 putts.
''It's great to win again, especially as I am 61 next month,'' he
said. ''It registers a score for the older seniors against some of the
younger men coming in.''
However, he had to concede some of the final day spotlight to tour
rookie Brian Barnes, the Senior British Open champion, who set a course
record of 66 to finish second on 215. Leading scores:
211 -- N Coles 71, 72, 68.

He edged past 20-year-old Frederik Jacobsson, last year's British
Youths Open Amateur champion. Leading Britons were Stuart Little, from
Minchin Hampton, and Paul Gareth Simpson, from Harpenden Common, in
joint fifth place on 285.

A THREE-under-par 69 in windy conditions was enough to give
Glencorse-based professional Colin Brooks a two-stroke victory in the
Renfrew Pro-am yesterday.
Playing the back nine first, Brooks reached the turn in level-par 36
before a fine closing half saw him notch four birdies and only drop one
stroke to be home in 33. Leading scores:
69 -- C Brooks (Glencorse). 71 -- B Dunbar (Easter Moffat), A
McCloskey (Airdrie), D Thomson (Kings Links). 72 -- W Guy (Buchanan
Castle), D Robinson (Fereneze). 73 -- R Weir (Cowal), G Weir (Braid
Hills), F Mann (Musselburgh), S Martin (North Engineering), G Collinson
(Windyhill), G Harvey (Grangemouth), S Stephen (Braid Hills), L Vannet
(Carnoustie Golf Links).
Team: 58 -- Renfrew (Paul Brookes (Braehead), Stuart Campbell, William
O'Donnell, Scott Johnstone).
* PETER Smith saw his course record broken by two shots in the
Portlethen Pro-Am on Saturday, then reclaimed it with a nine-under-par
63.
Smith's record of 66 was broken earlier in the day by David Scott, who
fired a 64, but Smith bagged seven birdies and an eagle on the final
hole across the demanding 6707-yard course to reclaim the honour.
Leading scores:
63 -- P Smith (Deeside). 64 -- D Scott (Letham Grange). 67 -- S
Thomson (Gleddoch), S Martin (North Engineering), A Crerar (Downfield).
68 -- S Kerr (Renfrew), S Henderson (Kings Links), B Marchbank
(Marchbank Golf Enterprises), G Harvey (Grangemouth). Team: 55 -- C
Ronald (East Kilbride), A Wells, B Yuill, J Marshall (AIS Wells).
* SCOTT Henderson won the Kintore Pro-Am with a four-under-par 66 in
squally conditions. Leading scores:
66 -- S Henderson (Kings Links). 67 -- G Harvey (Grangemouth). 68 -- J
Wither (Paisley). 69 -- K Hutton (Downfield), R MacDonald (Westhill), A
Marshall (Kingsknowe). 70 -- K Walker (Kings Links), B Davidson (Kings
Links), C Everett (Caldwell). Team: 54 -- A Crerar (Downfield), D Horne,
A Fyfe, T Caswell.
* A TWO-under-par 68 by Turnberry Hotel assistant Guy Redford was
enough to give him victory in the Shotts Assistants Pro-Am at the
Lanarkshire course yesterday.
The former Scottish youths cap reached the turn in level-par 35, and
followed with an eagle 3 at the 506-yard tenth. One further birdie at
the short thirteenth and a dropped shot the next were Redford's only
other departures from par. Leading scores:
68 -- G Redford (Turnberry Hotel). 70 -- D McCormack (Murcar). 71 -- I
Bratton (Cruden Bay), P Wardell (Longniddry). 72 -- M Hastie (Turnberry
Hotel), H Lee (Routenburn), F Menzies (Cawder). 73 -- N McGill (King
James VI), A Locke (Banchory), D Drysdale (Dunbar).
Team: 56 -- Keith Young (Broomieknowe), John McKae, Mark Burns, Kevin
Wright.

ALISTER McRae earned the distinction of becoming the highest-ever
placed British driver in the 45-year history of Finland's 1000 Lakes
Rally. At the finish in Jyvaskyla yesterday, he was classified third
overall in the fiercely fought F2 category for two-wheel drive,
two-litre cars.
On both the fourth and twenty-ninth special stages he coaxed his
Nissan Sunny GTI out of the timed sections on three cylinders after a
rocker arm broke in the upper engine. Only rapid roadside repairs by his
team kept him in the 1600 kilometres World Championship Rally.
''The second time the engine went on to three cylinders, we knew
exactly what was wrong,'' said McRae. ''My co-driver, David Senior,
radioed to our mechanics while we were still driving the special stage
so they could have replacement parts ready.''
Finland's Jarmo Kytolehto, driving an Opel Astra, won the F2 category,
with Sweden's Per Svan second in a similar car. Overall victory went to
last year's winner, Tommi Makinen, from Finland.
In two weeks' time McRae goes into the final round of the Mobil 1/Top
Gear British Rally Championship with a healthy lead and the prospect of
becoming the third member of the Lanark family to be crowned British
champion. Results:
1, T Makinen (Finland), Mitsubishi Lancer, 4hr 39min 25sec; 2, M
Gronholm (Finland), Toyota Celica, at 9min 31sec; 3, J Kytolehto
(Finland), Opel Astra, 20-41; 4, P Svan (Sweden), Opel Astra, 21-43; 5,
A McRae (GB), Nissan Sunny, 24-48; 6, M Korhonen (Finland), Mitsubishi
Lancer, 27-28; 7, M Ipatti (Finland), Mitsubishi Lancer, 27-52; 8, J
Ahvenlammi (Finland), Toyota Celica, 30-08; 9, M Utria (Finland),
Mitsubishi Lancer, 34-43; 10, P Sibera (Czech), Skoda, 37-32.

SHINTY
WHISKY distillers Glenmorangie have sprung a major pre-season
surprise. The Leith-based distillers, who ended their 18-year
association with shinty after last season's Camanachd Cup Final in Oban,
have announced that they are to continue their sponsorship of the
tournament for three more years.
The deal will be worth #15,000 a year to the Camanachd Association and
#3000 more is being committed to the shinty/hurling internationals with
Ireland.
With the first games in the new national premier league starting on
Saturday, the Glenmorangie deal is a considerable coup for
administrators, who had been struggling to find financial backers.
Camanachd Association president Duncan Cameron said: ''We are deeply
indebted to Glenmorangie for the huge contribution it has made to shinty
development over the years.
''We are delighted that this close relationship is to be continued and
that the company is now willing to support the Camanachd Cup and the
internationals. This makes it easier for us to complete our overall
sponsorship support.''
The new arrangement with Glenmorangie enables the Association to bring
in new sponsors for other competitions. The deal has been quickly
followed by another financial boost from a mystery couple who will
sponsor the Balliemore Cup, the Scottish Intermediate championship.
The couple, who are said to be keen followers of the game, wish to
remain anonymous, but their sponsorship of the trophy will be worth
#10,000 for each of the next two years. The competition will remain as
the Balliemore Cup and will not carry the sponsors' name.
Skye Camanachd, who narrowly failed to clinch a place in the new
national league set-up, have also clinched a new sponsorship deal with
Caledonian brewery.
Meanwhile champions Kingussie continued their pre-season preparations
with convincing 7-1 win over a north select at the Dell on Saturday
night. Last season's national player of the year, Ronald Ross, scored a
hat trick, as did Ali Borthwick.
Kingussie brought on defender Rory Fraser, formerly of Glasgow Mid
Argyll, as a second-half substitute and it seems likely he will be
returning to play with the champions. His return is welcome, as
Kingussie are likely to be without Michael Thain and Dave Thomson for
the first few weeks of the season, and there are still doubts about Eck
Sutherland and Dallas Young's availability.

SCOTLAND'S women bowlers lost the final test at Ra'ananna on Saturday
by 7-1 to leave Israel with a 3-0 whitewash in the series.
However, the match was a lot closer than the scoreline suggests for
Scotland suffered last-bowl defeats in the triples and fours.
In the pairs, Sarah Gourlay and Frances Whyte led Carmel Scop and
Renee Kusman 13-4 after 10 ends, but singles on the last two ends gave
Israel a 16-16 draw.
In the triples, Betty Forsyth, Eleanor Allan, and Joyce Lindores
counted a 5 on the sixteenth end to tie 12-12 against Isobel Myres,
Merle Swerdlow, and Maureen Hirschowitz. The Israelis edged ahead again
with a double, but a great trail of the jack from Lindores on the last
end left the Scots lying a match-winning four. However, Hirschowit, drew
shot with her last bowl and the Israelis scraped home 15-12.
In the singles and fours, Scotland looked as if they might get the
victories they needed when Sarah Gourlay led Swerdlow 11-6 in the
singles while the Scots led 12-2 in the fours.
However, Israel hit back to take the fours 22-20 and the singles
25-20.

ANYBODY who has been to the Braemar Games will tell you of the sheer
impertinence of the young polis who protect the toffs' enclosure, and
how you get cheeked, by proxy, by the junior Royals, while kilted nobles
running about with cromachs sneer at proles.
At Braemar what is really needed is a tumbril event, with the aristos
guillotined in front of a baying crowd driven in coachloads from
peripheral estates of our cities.
Well, Cowal is not like that one bit. Cowal is the People's Games, a
jamboree for the peasantry, and all the better for it. Well, we would
say that, for the Dunoon festival was originally partly set up by a
certain Major George Outram, and in 1907 the Argyle Shield was presented
by the bold soldier.
In 1909 Sir Harry Lauder started up the civilian pipe-band contest and
presented the Lauder Targe, later the Lauder Shield -- Lauder had been a
miner and knew that there was a burgeoning of pipe bands from every
community in Scotland.
There is a lot of history in the Cowal Games (the Games celebrated its
centenary just last year, in 1994). There is also a history of
absolutely awful weather.
History repeated itself on Saturday, for the day started with
torrential rain, which indeed put a dampener on the day, for had the
tropical sunshine of the past few months been present there would have
been massive crowds. A pity, but even then there were between 12,000 and
14,000 spectators crowding the beer tents at the weekend.
It cost roughly #85,000 to stage the event, which is undeniably one of
the major Games of the season, social cachet notwithstanding. This year
saw the return of the track racing.
This was the decision this year of a new and vibrant committee and
people like director Eric Brown with, he insisted on telling me, the
''help of the Spence brothers''.
Cameron and George, both athletes, worked hard to bring back the
running with perhaps the top 3000-metres field in Scotland, though, as
Eric said, ''we badly need a tartan track (ie, a weatherproof one), but
you never know.'' Says Brown, a captain with the Western Ferries which
brought myself across to Dunoon: ''We've had much increased sponsorship
this year and the future looks good.''
It does in the town itself. When the Yanks left Gareloch, it looked
serious for the little Bute town. But, oddly, Dunoon seems to have taken
on a new life. I spoke to new councillor John Allison, himself
originally from Perth, and owner of the Glasgow Hotel, established in
1706. He told me of the new Dunoon with pride.
Certainly you can smell a vibrancy about the place, a far cry from the
complacency I remember more than 30 years ago when I worked there as a
cocktail barman in McColl's Hotel.
A strange place, Dunoon: did you know the joint has bristled for years
with national politicians? John Smith, Brian Wilson, George Robertson,
even Virginia Bottomley, and most amazing of all, none other than Ken
Livingston, attended, at one time or another, Dunoon Grammar?
Adrian Callan, a school jannie of all things, won the much-valued 3000
metres; no doubt his chasing wee boys out of the school playground much
assists his training.
But despite the return of the athletics, two things which especially
delight the Cowal crowds are the strong men and the Highland Dancing.
This year Mark McDonald came in first very convincingly with a first
in the hammer, weight, and shot. He came second in the caber, thereby
being accorded a friendly observation from a fellow giant of a
competitor that he was ''a lazy big lump''. The spectators love it,
especially the caber, an awesome implement which defies one's notion of
engineering and dynamics. Frankly, it defies sense as well.
But what makes the Cowal Games unique is that it is where the Highland
Dancing World Championships are. It is where every dancer wants to
compete. This year there were more than 300 Scots entrants and 90
Canadians, with English and Americans there in good measure, three South
African dancers, and even one German.
The dancing had been moved, because of the rain, to the Queen's Hall,
but the Games organisers, with somewhat of a superhuman effort, had
managed to erect a platform at the stadium in the afternoon so that the
crowds could witness the finals.
The World Champion was Deryck Mitchelson, a 24-year-old from
Monifieth, Angus, who was defending his title from last year. He has
something of a pedigree, for brother Gareth had four years in the
eighties as world title-holder.
Two Canadian girls snatched titles, too, Natalie Ann Hall winning the
Junior, and Colleen Rintmaki taking the juvenile.
Later that night in Dunoon, even the adults were juveniles. It was
just the ticket for jaded journos, like myself.

MICHELE Mair and Kenny Wood retained their singles titles at the Du
Pont Scottish National Championships at Whitecraigs, Glasgow, yesterday,
writes Judy Murray.
Mair, ranked 451 in the world and No.14 in Britain, defeated the host
club's Nicola Burns 6-0, 6-3 in Saturday's semi-final to set up a clash
with double Scottish champion Heather Lockhart, who had survived two
match points on her way to a 6-7, 6-2, 7-5 victory over world-ranked
teenager Jennifer Duncan.
The Newlands player came within two points of clinching the first set
when she led 5-4, 30-30, but Mair fought back to win 7-5, 6-2 in 58
minutes.
Wood, who teams up with Mair, Lockhart, and Ross Matheson to represent
Scotland in next month's Four Nations International Championships in
Glasgow, dominated the men's event.
The 24-year-old from Dunfermline dismissed Ronnie Terras in the last
four and yesterday faced old rival Malcolm Watt, who had upset second
seed Jason Barnett. Wood found himself 4-3 down in the first set, but an
arm injury sustained by his opponent in the sixth game restricted his
service and he won just two more games as the Scottish No.3 recorded a
6-4, 6-2 victory.

TOURING CARS
RICKARD Rydell's hopes of closing the gap between himself and series
leader John Cleland were raised yesterday when the Swede took pole
positions for both of today's rounds of the Auto Trader RAC British
Touring Car Championship at Snetterton in Norfolk.
It marked the twelfth and thirteenth times that the Volvo driver has
claimed pole position in the first 21 qualifying sessions of the season.
However, Rydell, who trails Cleland by 40 points in the series, is
notorious for throwing away his front-row advantage by making slow
starts.
With just six rounds left in the championship and 24 points awarded to
the winner of each of tomorrow's races, Rydell can ill-afford any more
costly mistakes, particularly as the Renault of arch-rival Alain Menu
lines up alongside the Volvo at the front of the grid for both 20-lap
races.
Like Rydell, Menu desperately needs two good results to maintain his
challenge -- after 19 races he lays third in the table, 68 points adrift
of Cleland, who starts from third and sixth places on the grid
respectively.
Privateer Matthew Neal provided the biggest surprise of the day by
qualifying his Ford Mondeo in fifth place for round 21. Qualifying
results:
Round 20: 1, R Rydell (Sweden), Volvo 850, 1min 12.369sec, 97.10mph;
2, A Menu (Switzerland), Renault Laguna, 1-12.386; 3, J Cleland (GB),

GERMANY retained the Nissan European Nations Men's Cup in Dublin last
night by beating Holland 9-8 on penalties after a 2-2 draw.
The Olympic champions trailed 2-0 at half-time from goals by Wouter
van Pelt and Stephan Veen, but they levelled through Cristoph Bechmann
and a controversial penalty by Andreas Becker.
It was in the third series of penalties that Germany finally claimed
their victory after their own Bjorn Michel and Holland's Leo Klein
Gebbink had failed.
Ironically, it was player of the tournament, Marc Delissen, who cost
the Dutch the title, putting the ball over the bar as he attempted to
nullify Becker's opening counter.
The bronze mendal went to England, who overcame Belgium 2-1 in the
play-off for third place.
Scotland sank to their lowest position for 25 years when they finished
tenth. Fortunately, this was good enough to secure their place in the
preliminary round of the World Cup in Sardinia next year. They made
certain of their place on Saturday when beating Switzerland 3-2 in their
first classification match. Yesterday, though, they lost 4-2 to Belarus.

Rangers 1, Kilmarnock 0
USUALLY a player arriving at a new club requires time to settle and
become accustomed to the ways of others, but Gordan Petric has stepped
into the heart of Rangers' defence without having had to break stride.
His has been a classy introduction, almost imperious, and the former
Yugoslav internationalist appears already to be on the same wavelength
as those around him.
Petric played in Rangers' away leg of their European Cup preliminary
tie against Anorthosis Famagusta, and along with Richard Gough, made
certain Andy Goram enjoyed a relatively straightforward evening in
Cyprus. On Saturday he performed again with laid-back panache against
Kilmarnock at Ibrox.
That game was only his second competitive appearance for Rangers, but
he was totally relaxed, always looking to find his own people with the
ball -- a basic requirement in football you might think, but remember we
are talking premier-division football here -- and usually succeeding.
His style and thoughtful play should be of considerable benefit to
Rangers as they attempt to qualify from their Champions' League group,
but it will also make Rangers a more composed outfit in the frenetic
domestic league.
Petric will not resort to hurling the ball high and long towards Mark
Hateley, or whoever else may be up front for Rangers, and he probably
regards such desperate tactics as a sign of weakness. He wants to play
no matter where on the pitch the ball comes to him, and he has the speed
of mind and touch to be able to do so, unlike so many of the premier
division's other defenders.
Successful sides have the capacity to begin the construction of moves
from the back, and this is obviously what Walter Smith wants to see his
team indulge in. In Stephen Wright and David Robertson the manager now
has two of the fastest full backs in the game, and he will want to
utilise their qualities by having them break on to balls played
diagonally through defences, something Petric could do from deep
positions.
There may be times when Petric will be caught in possession, but he
can be used as a defensive and attacking force, and the early signs are
he will emerge as one of the dominant influences in this Rangers squad,
which is not short of big-time performers.
The Kilmarnock goalkeeper, Dragoje Lekovic, who played with Petric in
the former Yugoslavia's national side, was as impressed as ever with the
defender, and was anxious to talk about him even though Rangers started
another premier-division programme with a 1-0 win against Kilmarnock.
''I thought that with Gordan in the team, Rangers' back three looked
very good,'' he said.
''Others want to give the ball away all the time, but not him. He
wants to play, even if he is in his own box.''
Only five minutes from the end, Petric appeared to have played the
legs of Tom Brown and not the ball inside Rangers' box, but Kilmarnock
were denied the penalty. It seemed a harsh decision by referee Jim
McGilvray, and one which left the Rugby Park club's players furious.
Neil Whitworth claimed it was an obvious penalty and his alleged
criticisms of the referee might not be greeted too well at Park Gardens.
He could be invited to stop by headquarters to be reminded of SFA
protocol.
Naturally, Petric continued as though nothing had happened, but it
helped that Gough was beside him, because the Rangers captain has
started the season in sterling form, and looks as though he has been
given a new lease of life. He, too, has been extremely composed and it
is usually he who makes telling interceptions around his own penalty
area.
With Gough and Petric able to exert an influence, the third member of
the defensive line, Alan McLaren, should benefit. They may be able to
calm him down because he is still prone to lunging into tackles and he
can still be drawn out of position, but if he can't learn from Gough and
Petric, then no-one can help him to improve his game.
Rangers also introduced another of their close-season signings, Oleg
Salenko, but it might be some time before he is able to complete a full
match. He took over from Charlie Miller in the second half, but before
the end, the Russian was bent over gasping for oxygen.
''It's really the first time he has played in four or five months, and
it will take time for him to get the fitness he requires,'' said Smith.
''He's been doing a lot of training on his own -- pre-season stuff,
really -- but he will be in the side against Stirling Albion on
Wednesday.''
Salenko produced some good touches and might even have scored on his
debut, but there were also times when he appeared rooted to his spot
when the ball was played across Kilmarnock's box. However, that was a
problem not only he would suffer.
In 79 minutes, Robertson took a long throw on the left and sent the
ball into the box, where Lekovic, Neil Whitworth, and Tom Black were
caught in confusion. The ball carried all the way to the far post, where
Stuart McCall was waiting to pounce. He stabbed the ball into the net
and Rangers had started off in pursuit of their eighth successive
championship with a win.
Nevertheless, Kilmarnock knocked the ball around well and they won't
be easily beaten if they continue to play with the same degree of
confidence. They looked very sprightly and should be able to cause
problems to any other side's defence.

Falkirk 2, Aberdeen 3
HIS manner can be gruff, his language a little colourful, and when
John Lambie has something to say, he is the type of guy who never messes
about.
His Falkirk players trooped off the field at Brockville on Saturday,
heads bowed in dejection after having been done by Aberdeen. But you can
take it as read that Falkirk's finest will be feeling worse after Lambie
has brought home, in his eyes, a few home truths.
The man sat hunched in his chair looking almost distressed that
professionals under his leadership could have turned in such a shoddy
day's work.
''The first half was a gala day for Aberdeen,'' said the manager. ''It
was unbelievable. They just walked through our midfield and we couldn't
get near them. It was heart laziness and the goals they scored were a
joke.
''They have a lot of good players -- if you allow them to play.
Heavens, I could play if I was given the room they had.''
His eyes filled with anger as he became more and more agitated. ''I'll
have to make changes,'' he said. ''There are players here who are just
not good enough for this league.''
A few minutes later, some of the Falkirk players trooped out of the
ground, signing autographs as they went, oblivious, perhaps, to the
great annoyance they had aroused in their leader.
But was it really that bad? After all, it was Aberdeen they were
playing and Falkirk did manage to score two goals and were unlucky not
to force a draw late in the match.
The truth is that Aberdeen were, in stages on Saturday, the
infuriating team of last season, a joy to behold at times, while for
other periods, they didn't appear to know what day of the week it was.
''We showed again that we have two sides to our character,'' said
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken. ''We showed a little inconsistency in our
performance after having dominated the first half.''
A ''little inconsistency'' has the same ring of truth about it as
saying Gazza's new hairstyle is reserved and tasteful. But certainly, in
the earlier part of the game, Aberdeen looked the part. It is now up to
Aitken and his cohorts to make sure that the shine doesn't dim.
It all started so brightly for them when, after 30 minutes, John
Inglis headed Aberdeen into the lead. Approaching half-time, Billy Dodds
did the business to make it two. Joe McLaughlin and Steve Kirk scored
for the home lot, with Scott Booth netting the most important goal just
after the hour mark.
Later, Lambie was asked to record a message for the nation on TV. As
he walked to face the camera, his expression was enough to frighten the
children. Yes, Falkirk training sessions this week should be a load of
fun.

Hearts 1 Motherwell 1
CRAIG Levein has grown weary of the question. Twelve years at
Tynecastle and precisely 400 matches in a maroon shirt have been spent
watching other clubs share the silverware.
On the opening day of a new season, and playing for his fifth manager
at the club, the inevitable question comes up: Can this be the year
Hearts end their separation from major trophies?
At this stage, the Hearts' captain can only offer: ''Who knows? I'm
fed up saying that I want to win something with Hearts and every year
goes by and nothing happens.
''I know that this year I've got a good feeling but that's all I'm
prepared to say. It's early yet. It looks good at this stage and I'm
sure the manager is looking to bring in the type of player who will fit
into the system that he is playing.''
This was an encouraging start, if nothing more. At least Hearts
gathered a point from their opening league fixture which is more than
can be said of the previous three years.
Manager Jim Jefferies has shown his willingness to accentuate the
positive and this was as an attack-minded Hearts as has been seen at
Tynecastle in recent years.
New signing Alan Lawrence played through the middle with the
rejuvenated John Colquhoun, and Allan Johnston and David Hagen occupied
the flanks in a fluent Hearts attack which Motherwell struggled to
shackle in the first-half. The suspended John Robertson is due back to
face Dunfermline on Wednesday.
The most pleasing aspect for Jefferies must have been the variety of
attacks. The system is fluent enough to allow defenders to come forward
and try their luck and, at times, Motherwell seemed unsure of where the
next threat would come from in the Hearts' team.
It is a remarkable statistic that, of the 12 outfield players Hearts
used on Saturday, 10 of them had a direct attempt on goal. The only two
who did not try their luck were Fraser Wishart (who limped off after 51
minutes) and Scott Leitch (who played only the final six minutes).
Yet for all of this, Jefferies must be concerned that Motherwell
goalkeeper Scott Howie was not overworked and his team did not manage a
goal in a first-half they dominated almost totally.
''When we went in at half-time, frustration was the biggest factor,''
Levein admitted. ''Motherwell had hardly been up the park in the
first-half but what we had to try to do is keep our concentration in the
second-half, try not to give anything away and we knew something would
surely come.''
At the end of a hard week, Motherwell deserve credit for their
first-half resilience and making it a more even contest in the
second-half. They had the man of the match in the tireless and creative
Paul Lambert and, for the time they spent with their backs to the wall,
arguably created the best three chances.
Chris McCart was denied a first-half goal only by the goalkeeping
instincts of Henry Smith, Dougie Arnott headed a delightful goal in 64
minutes, and Alex Burns underhit a lob in the closing minutes which
allowed Smith to show his agility again.
In fact, it took a goal of genuine quality from David Hagen midway
through the second-half to deny them a win.
''I thought we controlled the second-half after we scored. If Burns
had scored with his lob, there would have been no way back for Hearts.
I'm not unhappy with the point,'' manager Alex McLeish concluded.

GERMAN OPEN
IAN Woosnam failed in his attempt to rescue a Ryder Cup place in
Stuttgart yesterday, leaving European captain Bernard Gallacher with the
nightmare he feared now a reality.
Gallacher is forced to leave out either Woosnam or Jose Maria Olazabal
for next month's match with the Americans after the Welshman, needing a
fifth-place finish in the Volvo German Open, managed only a closing 74
and thirty-third spot.
His six-under-par total of 278 was 10 behind Colin Montgomerie, who
birdied the last two holes for his first victory since the same event
last year.
Montgomerie, wearing the same outfit he did in Dusseldorf last August,
fired a 67 on the Schloss Nippenburg course to pip fellow Scot Sam
Torrance (70), and Swede Niclas Fasth (66).
Irishman Philip Walton, who just missed out in the 1989 Ryder Cup,
dropped seven shots in his last nine holes for a 77 and joint
sixty-ninth place, but he was not overtaken in the Ryder stakes.
Ulsterman Darren Clarke, Swede Jesper Parnevik, and German Sven Struver
also fell short, and the top 10 at the start of this, the final
qualifying event, are also the top 10 at the end.
Woosnam said: ''It's up to Bernard Gallacher, but the feeling I got
when I spoke to him last was that if Olly's foot is all right he is
going to pick him. I think there will be somebody blasting down
Bernard's ear.''
He did not say who, but it is not hard to guess that he meant Seve
Ballesteros -- Olazabal's partner in the last four matches.
Woosnam added: ''If I do miss out I think I will drink a fair bit
these next few weeks.''
Part of the anger he feels is because he and Europe's other superstars
have said all along that the Ryder Cup committee, of which Gallacher is
a member, should never have changed from three to two wild cards after
the last match.
Montgomerie holed a 25-foot putt on the short seventeenth, then almost
chipped in for an eagle at the par-5 last. The tap-in birdie put him
ahead of Fasth and left Torrance -- ahead until he bogeyed the sixteenth
-- needing to birdie the last to tie. But he was short of the green in
two and left his chip 25 feet short. The putt was never on line.
It not only cost Torrance nearly #52,000, but also the No.1 spot to
Montgomerie.
Montgomerie said: ''Winning means everything to me. There are a few
players in the world who don't come to finish second and I am one of
them.''
The closing slip may cost Torrance a place in the World Matchplay
championship at Wentworth in October. Leading scores (British or Irish
unless stated):
268 -- C Montgomerie 69, 64, 68, 67 (#108,330).

CURRIE travelled to Millbrae with 200 points and the remnants of
Edinburgh Wanderers and Musselburgh in their wake while Ayr brought but
their fitness sessions and unopposed training over the past six weeks to
a match conducted over four sessions, thereby adding to the phoney-war
atmosphere which always attends pre-season games.
With the leagues only seven days away, however, both sides approached
the match with a purpose which belied, on Ayr's part at least, the fact
that few shots had been fired in anger.
Ally Donaldson opened the scoring for Currie when Ayr were penalised
from the kick-off then had the kick advanced 10 yards for disagreeing
with referee Maxi McFarlane's decision.
The home side had the opportunity to redress the balance immediately
but newly arrived Kiwi stand-off Craig Foster saw his attempt fall
short.
Donaldson twice repeated the dose to give Currie a 9-0 lead after 20
minutes, during which they dominated the lineout through Dunn and Semple
and certainly had the upper hand in the loose.
That they failed to cross Ayr's line was due mainly to solid midfield
defence by the McMillans and the efforts of a doughty back row of Kenny
Nicol, Doug Smith, and David McVey, the latter returned from his
sojourns at Stirling County and West.
This pattern of play continued through the next two sessions, with
Donaldson landing a penalty and the conversion of Ward's try, having
failed to convert Weatherhead's score, Ayr's only riposte being a
penalty from Foster.
Having used most of their 25-strong squad, Ayr reverted to almost
their strongest side for the final spell and started to string things
together, culminating in George McMillan crossing for a try after
thrusts by McVey and Kerr. The final scoreline of 29-10 was of little
consequence in itself, the purpose of the exercise being to establish a
settled side, in Currie's case for the visit of Kelso next week while
Ayr will entertain Wigtownshire.
The Malleny Park men must be concerned at making so little out of so
much possession in the knowledge that they will be sorely harassed by
Kelso and will have to focus on improving a misfiring midfield, where
too many moves broke down.
Ayr's front five will need more ginger in their game and locks David
Moore and Kerin Martin, a New Zealand under-21 recruit, will require to
make more impact in the lineout against the wiles of the Drysdale and
Parker clans who descend on Millbrae next Saturday.
* BIGGAR have come a long way in a short time and now their aim is to
top the third division.
Despite the calls of agriculture, both the sides they took to Alnwick
on Saturday won.
After a stodgy first half the top team produced tries through winger
Willie Steele and flanker Alan Harvey, both converted by Malcolm Bruce,
to win 14-5.
''Our youth structure's paying off,'' said coach Bill Watson. ''We've
had four young players in Dunedin over the summer, and they're back
match fit.''

BELGIAN GRAND PRIX
WORLD champion Michael Schumacher was handed a one-race ban, suspended
for four races, after holding off a strong challenge by Damon Hill in
yesterday's Belgian Grand Prix.
Schumacher said he would appeal against the ban, which was assessed
following an appeal by the Williams team, who claimed Hill had been the
victim of bad and unacceptable driving by the German. Hill claimed the
champion had zig-zagged over the track and banged wheels with him to
prevent the Englishman overtaking him.
Hill, branded ''crazy and stupid'' after his overtaking attempt sent
both crashing out of the British Grand Prix last month -- when both were
warned about their future conduct -- was angry at the German's
behaviour.
''If bumping wheels is okay, then we'll do it,'' said Hill. ''If the
rules do not prevent using cars as instruments to prevent others from
overtaking -- in other words, drive at another car -- then the rules are
wrong, aren't they?''
Schumacher responded: ''I wanted to keep Damon behind me as long as
possible, because I knew the track would soon dry out and I would have
the momentum. I was defending my position. It got very tight, but I
think we did it satisfactorily.
''It was quite easy, because we did not do it at high-speed corners.
It was at low-speed corners, and nothing can really happen there. I
think it is acceptable then, because we are professional drivers and we
know how to keep the car on the road.''

CRICKET: SIXTH TEST
CARL Hooper yesterday bludgeoned and caressed the West Indies to a
formidable first innings 692 for eight declared, the West Indies'
highest score against England and second largest against all countries.
Hooper's 127 and a partnership of 196 with Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who
made 80, set the West Indies up for the record total in response to
England's first innings 454. Captain Richie Richardson, out for 93 in
the third over of the day, surpisingly delayed his declaration until the
record was passed 40 minutes after tea, giving his bowlers only 19 overs
to make inroads into England's batting.
Mike Atherton and Jason Gallian withstood the final session in
deteriorating light, taking England to stumps at 39 for no loss, but an
appropriate thrilling climax to a fluctuating series looms, with a draw
still the likely result.
Most of yesterday's damage was done by the Guyanese pairing of Hooper
and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who put together a stand of 196 for the
sixth wicket. West Indies could have gone on beyond 700, but they
settled for the tenth highest Test total of all time.
The West Indies total surpasses the 687 for eight declared which they
made, also at The Oval, in 1976. The England touring team of 1929-30
holds the highest total of both teams with 849 in Kingston. The West
Indies highest total is 790 for three declared against Pakistan in 1958.

Raith Rovers 0, Celtic l
THIS was the type of game which would have cost Celtic a couple of
points last season, another draw to go along with all the others which
blighted their title ambitions.
At Stark's Park, however, Celtic were able to score in the
seventy-eighth minute through Pierre van Hooydonk, which had manager
Tommy Burns suggesting that the goal threat which was missing on so many
occasions last season, had now returned.
Said Burns: ''I always felt we were capable of scoring, particularly
in the second half. We appear to be carrying more threat in the last
third of the pitch than we did last season.''
The 18 draws in the Premier League destroyed Celtic as potential
challengers for the championship and that must still haunt Burns and his
players as they begin this new campaign.
Their new #4m strike force of Dutchman van Hooydonk and the German,
Andreas Thom, has not yet gelled, even though both were involved in the
goal.
Thom won the free kick which led to van Hooydonk's header, which flew
beyond Scott Thomson, but there were complaints from the Kirkcaldy side
at that crucial decision.
The player directly involved, Davie Kirkwood, claimed later: ''I
didn't even make a challenge. He pushed the ball past me and then ran
into me. All I did was stand my ground and he went down, and the referee
gave the free kick.
''It was disappointing for us because we didn't believe they had
threatened us all that often.''
Thom, the new hero of the Celtic support, brushed aside any hints of
controversy. He said: ''I got the ball, pushed it past the defender, and
he stood in front of me. It was a free kick and I was never in doubt
about that.''
This was the premier-division debut for the new pairing and neither
man felt Stark's Park was the ideal setting for that occasion. More can
be expected from them when they take their talents on to bigger, wider
playing areas, but as a taste of how tight premier-division marking will
be, it was invaluable experience for the German internationalist.
Celtic's new centre half, John Hughes, has been over this course
before, although never with the expectations which surround the Parkhead
side. With Falkirk, he would probably have been happy to accept a share
of the points. With Celtic, that attitude will not be tolerated.
Hughes, however, declared later: ''I did not feel any extra pressure
today though, obviously, it was great to start with a victory. We didn't
give any goals away and if we can keep our defence tight, we know
someone up front will score.''
Raith did not have that comfort after Steve Crawford limped off in the
first half. He had caused problems to Hughes and Tom Boyd at the heart
of the Parkhead defence and, when he left, manager Jimmy Nicholl had to
re-arrange his team.
''We lost a bit after that,'' complained Nicholl later. ''I had to
push Colin Cameron up and bring on Danny Lennon. The way we had started
with Stevie, I thought we were ready to provide them with a few
headaches
''Still, we might have scored through Tony Rougier in the first half
and, while they had much more possession after half-time, I thought the
game was heading for a no-scoring draw. Then they scored and I can't say
I was happy with the marking from our lads when the free kick came
over.''
When John Collins swung the ball into the penalty area, the unmarked
Rudi Vata sent a header back across goal and there was van Hooydonk,
also unmarked, to finish things. Despite the feeling among the Raith
players that the giant Dutch star was offside, television evidence
proved otherwise.
Now the two sides must meet again at Celtic Park on Thursday in a
Coca-Cola Cup revenge tie. There were brave noises from Stark's Park
after this match, but the reality is that Crawford, new Kirkcaldy star
Rougier, and the experienced Jim McInally, are all doubtful and look
sure to miss the game.
Celtic left for home with no injuries to upset their plans.

THIRD DIVISION
IS THERE no stopping Jim Leishman's Livingston? Partick Thistle will
have a shot at it in midweek when they meet in the Coca-Cola Cup, but
meanwhile the new team have yet to taste defeat.
John Brogan's Arbroath must have been hopeful when Steve McCormick
scored just before the interval. But Jason Young equalised immediately
after the break, and added a penalty 12 minutes from time. Graham Harvey
made the points safe at 3-1 after Arbroath's John Fowler had been sent
off for a second booking.
Brechin City also have maximum points and they, too, fell behind just
before the break. New man Iain Stewart shot Caley Thistle ahead but the
1000-strong Inverness crowd were silenced in the second half by a quick
one-two from Ray Smith and Sandy Ross.
Albion Rovers scored first at Alloa through Gordon Young but lost 3-2.
Barry Moffat and John Bennett turned it around only for Martin Scott to
level with a solo run on the interval. Steve Rixon hit Alloa's winner.
Queen's Park were the only team to score first and go on to win.
Striker John McCusker scored with a 20-yard shot and a header against
Cowdenbeath. A Barry McMahon header pulled one back but Scott Edgar
sealed the points in the final minute.
The scoring-first taboo was back at work yesterday when an own goal by
Ross County's Johnstone Bellshaw put the hex on East Stirlingshire.  The
big defender scored at the right end just after the break and Jamie
MacPherson hit County's winner in 67 minutes.

Atlantic City
GARY Jacobs, in defiant mood, announced yesterday: ''I am convinced
that I can still win a world title and hopefully, when I get another
chance, I will have the advantage of fighting in Glasgow because boxing
at home these days is so important, especially after what happened
here.''
The 29-year-old was speaking after having lost a unanimous points
decision to America's World Boxing Council welterweight champion Pernell
Whitaker in Atlantic City, where the scoring was bizarre in the extreme.
There is no doubt Whitaker won -- but he had to pull out everything
and prove once again just why he is rated the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world. Yet the atrocious, bias scoring of the judges will
be remembered as another stain on the sport.
Judge Tamotusu Tomihara, of Hawaii, scored it 118-107, which was a
joke at which no Scot in the sell-out crowd of 3000 laughed at.
Australian Gus Marcurio made it 118-109, and Japan's Takeaki Kanaya
117-109 which wasn't much better.
American referee Ron Lipton was no better as he was constantly on the
back of the Scot for various offences -- surely some of them imaginary
-- while letting the champion do more or less as he liked. Indeed, in
the final round, Lipton told the judges to deduct a point from Jacobs
for holding.
He, like myself, must have thought the fight was close to make such a
decision, with Whitaker doing as much wrestling as the Scot.
That plus two stunning knock downs by the champion in the closing
stages made the Japanese judge score the round 10-6 to Whitaker. Yet
when Whitaker took a count of eight in the previous round, the man from
Hawaii scored that round in the champions' favour.
All of this and other matters will be included in an official
complaint by Jacobs' manager Mickey Duff to the boxing authorities.
He will also make a scathing attack on Larry Hazzard, boxing
controller of the state of New Jersey. ''His behaviour and language at
the weigh-in was appalling,'' said Duff. ''During one of the round
breaks at the fight he was seen telling the referee how to control the
fight -- that's something I've never seen before -- And when Gary had
been knocked down for the second time, he was at the referee to call it
a technical knockout but that was nonsense.
''We are taking nothing away from Whitaker. He won the fight and we
have no complaints about that.''
Jacobs was a credit to himself and Scotland. He could have taken
easier options but decided he wanted to fight the best, and he gave it
his best shot. ''Sure I'm disappointed and upset'' he said. ''The
scoring was a scandal but I have proved a point.
''I am now taking my wife and two children for a holiday where I'll
have a rest and then think about what is next.
''There are three other versions of the title and I'll probably go
down one of them, either Ike Quartey (WBA), Felix Trinidad (IBF), or
Eamonn Laughran (WBO). This was all a new experience for me and I'll be
all the better for it. Believe me, I will win a world title.''
Whitaker praised the Scots' effort: ''I would like to thank Gary
Jacobs for a terrific fight,'' he said. ''He was well prepared and did a
good job but his best just wasn't good enough.''
Whitaker likes to take control of fights from the start, but on this
occasion Jacobs didn't allow him to do that. He hustled the champion,
forcing him back with powerful jabs and hurt him with hooks to the body.
By the end of the sixth, the Scot was ahead on my scorecard.
''The lads in my corner were delighted with me at that stage,'' said
Jacobs. ''They told me I was in front and then I made the mistake of
taking my foot off the pedal.''
Either that or the champion raised his performance because the seventh
round was a big one for Whitaker. He caught Jacobs and began to control
the pace and tactics. I also thought Whitaker won the eighth and the
tenth.
Then came the first knock down of the fight in the eleventh round.
Both men threw a punch at the same time, Whitaker missed and stumbled to
the canvas, and the referee immediately began the count which reached
eight before he allowed the fight to continue.
''He didn't hit me,'' said the champion. And Jacobs said: ''I don't
remember too much about it. I saw him go over and the referee started
counting. You could hardly expect me to tell him it wasn't a knock down.
''Again I thought I was ahead but again I made the mistake of easing
up and paid for it when he caught me in the last round. I was angry with
myself and more so when I let him catch me again at the end.
''I'm not complaining about the result. He won it and is still a great
champion but the scoring was so unfair.''
Dino Duva, Whitaker's co-manager, later revealed that he had made
Ireland's Eamonn Laughran an offer of $1m to be the next challenger. He
said: ''I spoke to his manager, Barry Hearn, but he couldn't put the
phone down quickly enough -- he said they weren't interested. Obviously
they only want to fight in Ireland.''
Laughran has been shouting that he wants to fight Jacobs. That sounds
like an attractive proposition.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
CLACH star Stuart Golabeck will miss Saturday's Scottish Qualifying
Cup showdown with Peterhead after lashing out at Doug Rougvie.
Fiery Dunfermline target Golabeck elbowed the Huntly player-manager in
the forehead during the frantic final minutes of the Highland League Cup
semi-final.
Tempers frayed as Clach crashed out of the cup to a solitary Craig
Yates strike in 67 minutes.
Suspension rules Golabeck out of the next big tie, but the incident
could also spell trouble for Huntly.
Former Aberdeen and Scotland full back Rougvie faces a race against
time to be ready for league action after his head wound needed stitches.
Rougvie was reluctant to comment on the flare-up, but is understood to
be seething about Golabeck's conduct.
Huntly striker Gary Whyte is another injury doubt after hurting his
knee.
The Christie Park side lined up a dream final against holders Cove
Rangers, who outclassed Elgin City in the other semi.
Mike Beattie grabbed a double to add to his hat trick last weekend,
while Ray Lorimer rounded off a 3-0 drubbing.
Cove manager Kenny Taylor admitted: ''Two weeks ago, when we were hit
for six by Fraserburgh, I would have laughed in your face if you said
we'd make the cup final.
''Now things have clicked into place and I'm certain we can beat
Huntly.''
Elsewhere in the league action, only a handful of supporters turned up
to watch Rothes and Buckie dish up a ding-dong battle of epic
proportions.
The goal feast had Rothes 4-3 up at half-time, but Buckie sneaked
victory by 6-5.
Peterhead moved to the top of the table on goal difference with a
crushing 4-0 win against Lossiemouth.
Also tied on six points are Deveronvale and Keith, who enjoyed easy
wins at Forres and Fort William. Results:
Tennent's Highland League Cup: Huntly 1 (Yates 67min), Clach 0; Cove
Rangers 3 (Beattie 4, 63, Lorimer 69), Elgin City 0.
Highland League: Rothes 5 (Thomson 7, Pilichos 15, 59, C Smith 16,
Rowley 27), Buckie Thistle 6 (Thain og 21, Lumsden 29, 42, Bruce pen 50,
Begg 60, 80); Forres 1 (Graham 82), Deveronvale 4 (Dolan 5, Wolecki 60,
Grant 78, M Stewart 89); Peterhead 4 (Bridgeford pen 19, 49, Yule 26,

Partick Thistle 1, Hibs 1
EVEN AT Firhill things change but, it being Firhill, nothing much
changes, as a French proverb might have put it. There is the sparkling
new stand, a new manager, and the possibility of new owners, but Thistle
are very much still Thistle. They were at their impish best against
Hibs, drawing a game they ought to have lost and leaving the opposition
with that how-did-it-happen sensation.
Much the same could be said of the Hibees. They played well but didn't
take the chances they created. To be fair, they did a bit more than play
well, they were quite marvellous at times.
In fact, they really should have dumped Thistle with the kind of
score, 5-0, that they delivered against Dundee United on the opening day
of last term. Such early brilliance is hard to sustain, of course, and
they failed to reproduce that kind of victory, even when it might have
been possible. At least their manager, Alex Miller, can point to
genuinely encouraging signs, as he fielded a team, almost half of which
was at the apprentice stage.
Chris Jackson (20), Darren Dods (20), Kevin Harper (19), Steven Tweed
(23), and Graeme Donald (21) provided firm evidence that Miller is
unearthing some of the best talent in the country, the only rational
route forward for a club without the resources to match the Old Firm.
Jackson was particulalry effective as an attacking right back, Dods
did well in the other full-back position, Donald is getting used to the
premier-division midfield harassment, while Tweed has already
established his candidature for the first team, and Harper remains one
of the most exciting potential stars in the business.
''It was a very young team,'' said Miller, ''and that gives me most
satisfaction. When you are without as many senior players as we were, it
is good to know the challenge is there.''
Michael O'Neill, one of the more experienced brigade, reckons the fact
that the team hit form so well so quickly is down to the pre-season
work. ''It is down to a lot of hard work and getting our act together
quickly. What was good was to see the young players who have come in
doing so well. It means we all know there are people pushing for places.
''Chris Jackson has worked very hard. Last week he played on the left,
this week on the right. He has been given his chance and taken it.
Darren Dods was unlucky at their goal, but his use of the ball was
great.''
In the first half, Hibs dazzled and bemused Thistle, producing a
series of flowing moves that had the neutrals, if there were any outside
the press box, sitting up in delighted surprise.
One move which involved a handful of players ended with Harper, using
that electric speed, flashing into the box with only Nicky Walker to
beat. The striker tried to steer the ball past the keeper but pushed it
just outside the post.
Walker was outstanding. He had a clutch of fine saves, one in
particular from a ferocious volley by O'Neill, and in effect, stood
between Hibs and a handsome half-time scoreline.
Knowing all we know about Thistle, it was a racing certainty they
would now score first, and they did not let us down. The goal was lucky
in that young Dods slipped, allowing Andy Gibson to nip in and beat Jim
Leighton.
Gibson, who worked hard up front, especially in the second half,
proved as honest in his appraisal. ''It was a lucky goal, but they
count. We were disappointed at the way we played and Hibs must count
themselves very unlucky.''
The Jags did improve after the interval, playing some very decent
stuff themselves. They could not entirely deny Hibs some consolation,
and when O'Neill scored with a powerful right-foot shot, there was a
semblance of justice shown. The Edinburgh team hit the bar twice, and a
post, in searing raids afterwards, but Thistle had a couple of chances,
too.

THE environmental future of the internationally-recognised Rowardennan
Woodlands on the east shore of Loch Lomond has been secured by the
signing of a management plan between Forest Enterprise -- the commercial
arm of the Forestry Commission -- and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).
Rowardennan, which extends to 500 hectares (1235 acres), is a site of
special scientific interest (SSSI), and has 60% hardwoods, mainly oak,
and 40% conifers.
It forms about a quarter of the Forestry Commission's total
landholding on the east shore of the loch, and is managed by Forest
Enterprise. The oakwoods are part of the most extensive area of native
broad-leaved trees in Scotland and a component of a semi-natural
landscape of loch, forest and moorland.
Before the signing ceremony, Hugh Clayden, the Aberfoyle Forest
district manager, conducted a tour around the SSSI to indicate agreed
management objectives.
Blair Wood was managed as oak coppice with standards for charcoal and
tanning for at least 250 years by the Dukes of Montrose, until the
beginning of this century.
The site was underplanted extensively with conifers in 1964 by the
Forestry Commission as part of the then policy of enrichment to obtain a
cash crop. ''One of the principal objectives of the management plan,''
said Mr Clayden, ''is to maintain and restore the ecological diversity
of these and similar woods.''
This has three phases. The first is past. It ended in 1969 when the
underplanting policy ended. There has been no further loss of native
broad-leaf woodlands in the SSSI since then.
The second phase is to restore those sites that were native woodlands
and are now carrying a conifer crop. This will involve the removal of
some 170 hectares throughout the SSSI, most of which will be felled
within the next five years.
The third phase involves restoring to semi-naturalness the existing
native broad-leaves, although they have all, to a great extent, been
influenced by man's activities.
Other species of trees in the SSSI oakwoods include elm, ash, holly,
alder and birch. There is not much Scots pine; it is concentrated in the
Ross Wood.
This will be managed to mimic the Caledonian pine woodland structure
in an attempt to increase the area of habitat suitable for capercaillie.
The big grouse is found in Ross Wood and on the islands of
Inchtavannach, Inchconnachan, Inchmoan and Inchcruin on Loch Lomond.
The population is small, the 1995 count recording 27 birds, with males
outnumbering females by two-to-one.
Sir Peter Hutchinson, Forestry Commission chairman, said that if the
full population of the woodlands was to be realised on a sustainable
basis, a truly multi-purpose approach to managing them had to be put
into effect.
''This comprehensive management plan sets out a clear framework, and
Forest Enterprise will now be able to go ahead with an ambitious, but I
believe a deliverable programme, over the next five years.
''We have seen some of the issues involved in managing a forest for
multiple purposes; the bringing together of the recreational aspects,
people going out to enjoy themselves, as they do in great numbers, in
the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park.
''Alongside this is the commercial objective of Forest Enterprise. All
is set in this very sensitive, ecological matrix. It shows the
complexity, and indeed the cost, of managing a sensitive area such as
this.

So I took it to the smiddy
But there I found a queue
For Hillie and Mossie and
Mains were there
And their's were broken too.
I COMPOSED that rather sad little chorus last Monday.
It was going to be such a good day. The hash was on. The Man of Few
Words was here to plough the barley stubble and sow the crops which will
surely make me a rich man in 1996. All day long a great five-furrow slab
of Little Ardo would be folded over, hard behind would come the one-pass
to sow the seeds, and I would follow as quickly as might be with the
rollers to seal in what little moisture had been left by the summer's
drought.
In the meantime Potions, the chemist who comes to play in his spare
time, would clear a way in front of us by removing bales of straw from
the fields, and even the Wasting Asset would appear at a decent time of
day, certainly before ten. His job would be to start sorting out the
mess in the cornyard.
It would be almost like old times again on the farm, with people on
it. And I suppose it was really, for things broke down even in the old
days.
The ploughing and planting had hardly started when the ram that shoves
the plough over at the end of the drills, so that the five socks that
plough north can be engaged and the five that plough south rested,
broke. Though it is an inch-and-a-quarter thick it snapped in two, with
a break so perfect that it was hard to believe it hadn't been cut by a
machine.
Though with all that weight of tackle it was by no means straight
forward, we got the ram off. The Man of Few Words got on the phone.
There was not a ram like this one to be had in the whole of
Aberdeenshire. One would have to come from Leicester.
It was a lovely day and I knew the Man of Few words would be quite
happy to leave as soon as the dew was off to bale some of the malting
barley that is being cut round about, so my trick was to get the ram
sorted quick.
So I took it to the Smiddy
But there I found a queue
For Hillie and Mossie and
Mains were there
And their's were broken too.
The Red Rooster was there and all. He'd burst something about the
side-knife of his combine and was adamant that his job would need to be
done first as he had rape which was down to 7% and falling. His rape
cheque was shrinking before his very eyes. And Penny Washers, the White
Settler, had an even bigger crisis. His daughter's holidays would be
ruined if she didn't get a bit brassed on to her pony's bridle.
By the time I eventually got to the top of the queue I had been joined
by Potions with a burst oil pipe from the digger. The smith would make
up a new unit for me, but I'd need to go 15 miles to a hydraulics firm
for a new ram for he didn't have one the right thickness.
Off I went and was returning on the hour when I overtook the Wasting
Asset limping up to the smiddy. He always drives like time was short and
a cup medal was at stake so it was no wonder that he'd broken one lift
arm on the old International. That had sent the bale grab smashing
through its window.
So he took it to the smiddy
But there he found a queue
For Hillie and Mossie and
Mains were there
And their's were broken too.
There were countless hold ups that afternoon, but I got all my
equipment back to the field at five o'clock, by which time the Man of
Few Words had gone off baling and my day was ruined.
It had all been Mossie's fault really. He it was he who suggested that
I stop growing wheat and spring rape and concentrate on winter barley
and rape. He's done the same himself. What it means is that instead of
having four small harvests between August and September, and a sowing
season that lasted until well into November, we now have two big
harvests in August and must have all of what used to be called the
spring work done by the last week of September.
And the mad rush is set to get worse as more and more people here
realise that wheat is only best two years in five and spring rape is
worst every year.
One of Mossie's answers was to buy a Mega. This combine costs #165,000
if you're not careful, so I hope he's worked out that it will only be
working for four weeks in the year, if everyone follows his advice.
Maitland Mackie also bought a Mega this summer. Now the former
vice-president of the National Farmers' Union is lucky enough to have on
his farm the man who (before VJ Day) brought the first combine to
Westertown. His many admirers will be pleased to hear that Sir Maitland
Mackie wheels around the place in a battery drive golf buggy and still
takes a keen interest.
But even the great man had difficulty in grasping the finances of the
Mega. As he drove round the hulk which cost considerably more than his
father had paid for the title deeds, the old man asked to be reminded:
''How much did my first combine cost?''
''#880, Dad.''
''And how much did this cost?''
''#108,000 plus the old one.''
''And how much did my first one cost?''
''#880.''
''And how much did this one cost?''
''#108,000 . . .''

<HEADLINE>Farmers on financial knife edge. Industry to press Minister for emergency cash aid.</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976666816</RECORDNO>

A SHARP increase in demand for silage and soaring prices will leave
many Scottish farmers on a financial knife edge this winter, according
to NFU Scotland's senior commodity director Richard Henton.
Because of the acute cash pressure that will fall on the industry in
the autumn, the Earl of Lindsay, Scottish Office Agriculture Minister,
will be pressed for cash aid for the hardest hit.
Said Mr Henton: ''We do not yet have all the figures to allow us to
assess the problem but we expect to be urging an increase in HLCAs (Hill
Livestock Compensatory Allowances) -- or a special payment.''
NFU officials have a scheduled meeting with the Minister on November 2
and the question of emergency financial aid for Scotland's farming
industry -- particularly specialist high hill sheep farms where the
average annual income is just #8500 -- is sure to be on the agenda.
Ninety per cent of Scotland's 18,000 farmers make their livelihood in
what are officially-designated Less Favoured Areas.
The Minister will be reminded that 10 years ago the Scottish Office
agreed special weather payments -- on that occasion, ironically, because
of continued heavy rain throughout the summer which forced farmers to
leave sodden crops in the ground.
This summer it has been drought and high temperatures. ''There will be
sufficient fodder in the country but it will be expensive. Many farmers
will be very much on a financial knife edge,'' said Mr Henton.
A late spring and this summer's drought have produced shortages that
have already forced silage prices up 58% on last year's figure while the
cost of straw is running 26% up on 12 months ago.
Early returns from an NFU survey indicate demand for silage up by 30%
already this year and, according to Mr Henton, likely to rise even
further. Response to the union's costs survey has been slow to come in
and is being treated as ''only indicative'' but, says Mr Henton: ''I
expect the late answers will show an even sharper rise in prices.
''We have got until November and the situation could improve but my
guess is that prices for silage, hay and straw will continue to rise
even higher, perhaps up to 50% on last year and that was pretty
expensive.'' Hay in Scotland currently costs #85 a tonne and straw #43.
The fodder problem started this spring -- cold and late -- forcing
many farmers to exhaust their winter supplies. First cut silage was,
according to Mr Henton, not too bad but: ''Come July and August, with
continued heat and no rain, there was not the grass. Very few managed to
get a second cut and now they are having to lay in winter feed because
of the shortfall.''
If fodder prices rise as high as feared the hill farmers' case for
special financial help will certainly be pressed with vigour by NFU
officials when they meet the Minister -- not least because of the steady
wastage of small units that have disappeared from the scene -- a decline
of around 25% in the past 15 years.
There is also fear of further financial hardship next year, the
concern being that the dry weather could have left ewes in poor
condition for breeding. A poor lambing next spring -- either because of
a higher-than-usual porportion of barren ewes or severe weather -- would
add greatly to the financial pressures on farmers. Said Mr Henton: ''The
west of the country would, as usual, be the hardest hit.''
Scottish Office cuts in HLCA over two years -- totalling 28% -- have
squeezed the differential between farmers in Less Favoured Areas and the
10% who farm in more benign conditions. A major effort will be made by
the NFU at its November meeting with the Minister to have that reversed.
The grassroots membership has been asked to play its part in putting
pressure on the Government by arranging briefing meetings with local
MPs. Union president John Ross has been out and about speaking to hill
farmers and recently addressed a meeting in Fort William.
His message to the Government is that unless a real commitment is made
to hill farming the rural population in some of the upland areas will
sink to unacceptable levels and a spiral of decline will set in. ''HLCA
payments are crucially important to the level of economic activity in
some of Scotland's remotest areas,'' he said.
Mr Ross's promises to fight for the hill farmers hae not diverted the
Scottish Hill Enterprise and Farming group (Sheaf) from making its own
representations. It will join with hill farming lobby organisations from
England and Wales to meet ministers in London next month.
When the Earl of Lindsay was tackled about the plight of hill farmers
this week he highlighted the Government's ''solid commitment'' to that
sector and listed the ''wide number of schemes'' -- HLCAs, livestock
subsidies, extensification subsidy and Objective One money for the
Highlands and Islands -- designed to direct money to the hill areas.
It was, he said, too early to predict what the HLCA settlement would
be. A response that, in itself, was entirely predictable.

IT is an astonishing coincidence that a great Scottish bridge builder
from the past and the man with the unenviable job of stopping Glasgow's
Kingston Bridge from sliding into the Clyde should share the same name.
There is no family connection between Thomas Telford, the
Dumfries-born civil engineer, and Ian Telford, project manager at the
problem-ridden Kingston Bridge.
However, a shared destiny with river crossings will ensure both of a
place in civil engineering history, although the emphasis will vary.
While the elder Telford is remembered for significantly durable
engineering projects such as the Menai Straits Bridge and the Caledonian
Canal, Telford the younger would wish to be recognised as the man who
took a flawed, modern structure and, by one of the most spectacular
rehabilitation projects in engineering history, made it strong enough to
fulfil its role as the nucleus of the West of Scotland's motorway
system.
Although filled with admiration for the work of his famous namesake,
Airdrie-born Ian Telford, 42, a father of three, claims that
strengthening and assessing bridges calls for more engineering judgment
than designing a bridge from scratch.
He argues: ''If you're having to live with what's there and what has
happened to it, the engineering is more challenging and requires a lot
more judgment than a straightforward design from a sheet of paper.''
Indeed, involvement in an awesome project such as saving the Kingston
Bridge has for him been all-consuming and invasive of his private time
-- as his family can testify.
Calls to his home about the state of the bridge and sleepless nights
as he wrestles with highly complex engineering problems, take their toll
on normal family life.
Even his six-year-old daughter, Laura, is aware of the enormous
pressures on him and has composed a ditty out of sympathy for her
father's predicament.
''Kingston Bridge is falling down,
My poor daddy!''
Despite his weighty responsibilities, the younger Telford adopts a
positive attitude. The bridge, opened in 1970, is not falling down. Its
highly-complicated refurbishment is an exciting challenge often taking
his project team to the cutting edge of new technology.
Consequently, the operation has attracted interest from all over the
world, and many delegations have visited Scotland to see progress first
hand -- from Europe, United States, and China, and lectures have been
given in the Far East.
Next month, Ian Telford is off to Montreal to present a paper on the
Kingston Bridge to the World Road Conference.
It is ironic that as Strathclyde region pursues the original designers
through the Court of Session, claiming that the bridge suffers from a
design fault, new engineering reputations are being built on the back of
that alleged design failure.
Like any bridge of its type, Kingston Bridge was designed to allow for
movement in its structure.
However, as the whole world now seems to know, at the centre of the
span a dip has appeared in the bridge deck. Cracks underneath the bridge
signalled a potential weakness in the centre span. On the north bank of
the river, cracks were apparent in the quay walls, while alongside walls
were bulging.
On the road surface, which carries more than 155,000 vehicles per day,
expansion joints designed to open and close with changing temperatures,
were raising other questions.
The answer was that the deck of Kingston Bridge had moved northwards.
Over the past four years, Ian Telford's project team has recorded and
monitored the structure. Thirty-six censors on the pillars and on the
ground feed information on the bridge's movements. One hundred and
twenty-eight thermometers measure the bridge deck temperatures.
Air temperature, wind speed and direction, and humidity are also
recorded.
Indeed, Kingston Bridge is probably the most heavily monitored bridge
in the world.
The first set of remedial contracts was for the stabilisation of the
quay wall. If the quay wall had collapsed, rapid washout of the sand
gravel below the footing was a real possibility.
The work ensured the pillars and quay wall remained stable at every
stage, and at no time was bridge traffic disrupted.
Work also began on refurbishing the cope and parapets, pieces of which
were falling off, much to the consternation of the citizenry.
As if that were not enough to contend with, the bridge also requires
to conform to new European regulations on loading. Work was needed to
strengthen the superstructure.
In extreme cases, too much load on the centre of the bridge could
cause the ends to lift.
Immediately, one lane of the bridge was closed to vehicles of over 7.5
tons. One lane was closed completely and concrete ballast placed to the
bridge ends.
Even more complex work lies ahead with the bridge strengthening
measures. The system of bearings on the north and south piers will be
replaced. Strengthened piers are to be constructed, requiring piers to
be built up around the existing one.
A jacking system will then support the bridge on the new piers, after
which the old piers will be removed.
Finally, and amazingly, the deck of the bridge will be jacked to the
side, the new bearings installed, and the jack removed.
Three major contractors -- Morrison Construction, Balfour Beattie, and
Norwest Holst -- are preparing tenders and work is expected to start
early next year.
It is an awesome task and one worthy of the older Telford.
The sheer scale and complexity of the remedial works has prompted
Strathclyde's director of roads, Mr Donald Carruthers, to demand that
proper and correct maintenance manuals for such complex structures
should be made available by bridge designers and that monitoring
instruments should be built in from day one.
His talented project engineer, the Young Telford, joined Strathclyde
Regional Council in 1979 following a four-year spell with Babtie Shaw
and Morton. Initially, he was involved in the design of piers, harbours,
and ferry terminals and worked on the Gigha ferry terminal, the
extension to Campbeltown harbour, and a pier for Tiree.
After two years in the marine section, he made an important step
towards his destiny by joining the bridges section, working on such
schemes as the Townhead interchange, then as senior engineer on the M80
Stepps by-pass where he designed some of the bridges.
His first contact with the task that was to dominate his life was in
June 1990 when he was seconded to the project team for Kingston Bridge.
He was appointed assistant project manager in February 1992, and
became project manager in June 1993. He was well and truly hooked.
One night last week, he was on the bridge at 10pm looking at movements
in the expansion joints because of the hot weather.
He explained: ''It was pretty close to being at its longest in the
five years I've been involved. So we closed another two lanes of the
bridge and went out and inspected the joints from the deck and from
beneath the bridge by torchlight.''
He concedes the project is all-consuming, involving work at odd hours
and at weekends if there are problems that require lane closures.
Does he ever switch off? Very rarely.
''While work on really complex jobs provides a lot of satisfaction, it
does suck you in and consumes you totally,'' he says.
''There are times when you're so wrapped up in it, you get out of bed,
have a cuppa and doodle some notes. It's just because you're unable to
switch off. It's not the kind of job where you switch off a five o'clock
and go home. The job is always there in your mind.''
The pressure is likely to be on him for for some considerable time
yet.
He points out: ''We've a ten-year programme of work ahead and if I'm
fortunate enough to be involved in that there are a lot of people who
would swop places with me.
''I'd like to see the job through to the end.''
For him, there is no question of a catastrophe given the prudent steps
taken by the project team since 1990.
He declares: ''I feel the bridge is safe and it will remain safe right
through the strengthening works and then when we get it back to full
capacity.
''I have no qualms about using the bridge. If I'm driving to the
airport or anywhere south, I always use the bridge.''
As we converse, a shrill telephone at his elbow is screaming for
attention. He tries to ignore it, but after a few minutes, he yields and
answers it -- ''Just in case,'' he sighs. Happily, it is a routine call.
Surprisingly, he finds the public has been tolerant about the problems
with the bridge and the traffic disruption.
This he attributes to the huge amount of information put out by
Strathclyde roads department, making the public well aware of what is
going on.
He grins: ''Obviously, we've had some people asking when we were going
to close the bridge so they can book their holidays. But generally
speaking, people realise the extent of the task we're facing and are
tolerant of what we're trying to do.''
The fact that the bridge casts a shadow over his limited social life
provokes a wry smile. Once people discover he's the Kingston Bridge man,
he is buttonholed by lay experts, all of whom have solution to the
bridge's problems.
This unwelcome celebrity is coupled with an acute sense of social
conscience.
Life without the bridge would make one heck of a difference. There is
simply not the same capacity elsewhere.
It cost #9.5m to build. Strathclyde has already spent about #11m on
the bridge and its approaches. A further #10m is required for the bridge
strengthening. Depending on which strategy is adopted for the
approaches, which also require further work done on them, a staggering
cost of #50m could well be reached.
Mr Telford argues, however, that this has to be balanced against the
horrendous cost to the community, business, and commerce -- probably in
the region of #500,000 a day -- that would be consequent on total bridge
closure. There could well be serious employment implications.
He adds: ''If a person has a heart attack in the South Side of the
city, how to you get the ambulance to hospital? These kinds of things
have got to be considered.''
Looking to the longer term, he sees the emphasis in civil engineering
industry shifting from designing roads and bridges to taking care of
existing stock.
Therefore, in having to cope with a very difficult situation because
of a design faults on the Kingston Bridge, he and his team are
developing skills, technologies, and experience that are going to be
invaluable in other parts of the world.
He agrees: ''Yes, there will be a lot of people watching what we do.
Our techniques and methods could be developed for the strengthening of
lesser structures. Certainly, these skills will be much sought after.
''There is life beyond Kingston Bridge I hope,'' concludes the younger
Telford.

WHEN Ian Cherry was made redundant for the second time he did not get
on his bike to look for work.
Instead he put together a package of loans, invested his own capital,
harnessed a handsome pair of greys and drove off to fulfil a lifetime's
ambition on the box seat of a carriage.
Now the 29-year-old coachman teaches the sport of princes -- well,
Prince Philip's favoured pastime at any rate -- to a growing band of
enthusiasts who get their kicks with a pair in hand.
Aged from just 11 to late middle age the pupils of the former head
coachman at Scot-Mid Co-op are taught the skills of carriage driving on
the public road and at a private cross-country circuit complete with
water-splash . . . the real effort coming from Ranger, Harvey, Storm,
Misty, and Cally.
Three of the five magnificent greys at Mr Cherry's Edinburgh School of
Carriage Driving formerly worked with the Co-op until it closed its
carriage hire business and carriage driving school last October.
Ranger, at almost 30 the oldest of Mr Cherry's five carriage horses
and referred to with no disparagement as ''the spare'', was once in the
milk business . . . 16 years between Co-op shafts delivering gold-top
and yoghurt throughout Edinburgh. And no, he does not know Sean Connery.
Mr Cherry says: ''I was head coachman at the Co-op when the carriage
department closed and I was made redundant -- for the second time.
''I lost my first job as a miner when Bilston Glen Colliery was shut
and here I was, out of work again. I have been around horses all my life
and had been driving them since my late teens so I simply bought what I
needed from my former employers and set up on my own in the same line.
''I managed to get loans from the Bank of Scotland, Midlothian
District Council, also British Coal's Enterprise Fund, and put in my own
money as well.
''I was able to buy three horses from the Co-op and some vehicles . .
. including the splendid glass coach which dates from the 1860s. It was
restored by the Co-op just over three years ago at a cost of #15,000.''
The glass coach, an open landau and a shooting-brake wagonette --
borrowed from the Co-op by the Queen some years ago in order to exercise
royal horses at Balmoral -- are all in demand for weddings and other
special occasions.
Mr Cherry can even do a horse-drawn funeral, the hearse coming from a
collection at Hopetoun House and formerly part of the Co-op's fleet of
nearly 30 horse-drawn vehicles . . . milk carts apart.
Of the Co-op's carriage collection nine went to Hopetoun House, bought
by West Lothian District Council as the core of a collection shown
there, and six to another museum.
The landau at Mr Cherry's Edinburgh School of Carriage Driving can be
drawn by one, two or four horses and his ambition before the year is out
is to run it as a four-in-hand -- an ambition in part fuelled by the
knowledge that such a rig in the south of England is currently
commanding a hire fee of #1000 a day.
''This is still just the first year of the business but it is busy and
as far as teaching carriage driving is concerned I can say that not one
pupil has failed to come back again.
''Carriage driving really catches people -- partly because it is
different, but mainly, I think, because it is very relaxing and
enjoyable. Mark you, it can be exciting too,'' says Mr Cherry.
Pupils learn the rudiments on a light one-horse rig known as a silky
and, at #15 an hour, are taught how to master tight turns, backing up,
steering through cones and the more challenging techniques demanded by
the cross-country course.
All that mastered the pupils can enjoy the quiet local roads around
the school's premises just a mile-and-a-half south of Penicuik. Two
horses in the traces and the cost rises by #5. Pay-off for the greys for
their endeavours is, apparently, an end-of-lesson mint with a hole.
''As well as teaching people to drive -- we get all kinds, police,
dentists, doctors, brickies -- we do carriage hire for a wide variety of
occasions, specially weddings, and an increasingly popular event known
as Japanese Blessings -- couples who have married in Japan and then
flown to Scotland to have, for some reason, their marriage blessed here.
I have had about a dozen of these in the past year.''
Physical strength is not necessary for carriage driving, says Mr
Cherry, whose pupils include an 11-year-old girl -- ''very promising''
-- and ''some arthritic old ladies''.
It is, he says, something that anyone can have a go at if they don't
mind running the risk of getting hooked. Who knows, one day they may be
able to drive a four-in-hand which is a lot of horse-power -- top of the
Ranger one might say.

FROM 20 miles away the island silhouette, hazy in the sunshine,
beckons temptingly from the crowded, throbbing Tenerife resort of Los
Cristianos. La Gomera, the second smallest Canary Island, exercises a
spell which only a visit to it can break.
Its rugged terrain, covering most of the surface, has determined
Gomera's past history and the development of its unique, though now
little-used, whistling language practised today mostly for the benefit
of visitors.
But in La Gomera, geography supports the concept of such a means of
communication as in few other places. The altitude of its highest peak,
Alto de Garajonay may not be a great height by the standards of some of
the larger islands but Gomera offers the impression of a fearsome maze
of eerie crags.
This dramatic, savage and utterly sensational environment covers the
whole island with little more than the thickly wooded plateau of the
Garajonay National Park at its heart that could be described as anything
approaching a horizontal plane.
Arrival at La Gomera is by way of the port of San Sebastian, the
island's capital and not one of great inspiration despite the fact that
Christopher Columbus also resided here for a time.
There is but one beach on the island. This is the swathe of volcanic
sand spreading out at the bottom of the beautiful multi-tiered Valle
Gran Rey. Here on steep terraces, avocados, pineapples and dates are
grown in addition to bananas.
A curiosity of the often wetter north coast is the strange rock
formation known as Los Organos consisting of thousands of regularly
shaped basalt columns rising everywhere from the sea like the pipes of
some mighty organ.
General information from the Spanish National Tourist Office, 57-58 St
James's Street, London, SW1A 1LD.

Andrew MacKay visits Shropshire where the past is very much part of
the present
IT is certainly a relief to leave the screaming thrust of the flat
packed M6 into a county which on many another day has been flashed past.
Apart from turning three lanes into one, the slower A53 lets the car's
window come down to allow the scents and sounds of Shropshire
countryside to waft in.
It takes a spell, a gradual adjustment of the senses before the
realisation that this area, jammed between the motorway and the Welsh
border, has been left behind in a time warp.
Thick hedgerows line narrow roads and long drives lead up into elegant
ivy-covered houses. Old ladies on bicycle tring tring their way to the
village shops and it just seems possible that behind every curtain a
Miss Marple may be in wait for her next assignment.
Quaint village pubs with thatched roofs appear righteous, almost
temperate, possibly offering the thirsty traveller lashings of cold
ginger beer. The village Bobby puffs contentedly on his pipe, while
keeping an eye on the cricket match being played on the village green.
And the only sign of any discord in this ideal area is the occasional
skirmish between William and that terribly spoiled bully, Hubert Green.
Life certainly appears to be running at a gentle pace and even
transport has silently slipped into the sky. And huge multi-coloured hot
air balloons are a common sight as they drift by casting a bulbous
shadow downward from their aerial path.
Market Drayton announces on its boundary sign that it is home of
Gingerbread which seems fairly futuristic for a town enveloped in
historical traditions. However, it is not that the town has no care for
the single parent organisation but that its links are with gingerbread,
the delicacy, and go back 200 years.
A great deal of commotion draws the eye to where a small crowd has
gathered. At its hub are two ranks of white-clad dancers decked with
ribbons, cross-belts and bells. The ritual consists of much
stick-clashing and handkerchief-waving by the group whose faces appear
blackened in disguise but possibly no more than to represent the Moorish
origins of morris dancing.
Clive of India was first of Market Drayton for he was born here in
1725. He must have known he was going places and as a boy he would climb
St Mary's tower and look down on the town. If Clive were around today
and he made his climb on a Wednesday he would look down on the town's
market. As market's go this one is a worthwhile visit because on sale
are many ''perfect'' items from well-known Staffordshire potteries, and
at a fraction of the normal retail price, or so the stallholder said.
But where does the weary time-traveller eat and lay his head down?
Guests who first enter Old Colehurst Manor just outside Market Drayton
may be forgiven for momentarily feeling that they have just gone into
one of Walt Disney's themed attractions. It is a house that is authentic
seventeenth century in every way from the flag-stone floors, four-poster
beds, crockery, cutlery, costume and cuisine.
Because of the industry of owners Bjorn and Maria Teksnes, the hotel
offers a unique experience -- to step back in time.
Bjorn was a professional golfer playing on the European Tour. He had a
lot of fun but didn't earn much money. Maria, a beauty consultant from
London, met the genial Norwegian while he was competing in a golf
tournament in Spain. They married shortly afterwards by which time Bjorn
had taken up a golf tuition job near London.
After seeing Colehurst Manor in a property magazine, Bjorn and Maria
were attracted to it right away and decided to make a visit. A sad,
lonely and neglected figure of a house stood before them. They bowed
their heads and returned to London. Still somewhat seduced by the house
Bjorn and Maria made a second trip the following day. The house, they
decided, needed love and tender care and wishing to restore that
one-time pride they bought it.
Son of a cabinetmaker from Bergen, Bjorn believed he had been born
with some kind of inherent skill and it was this that steered him
through the immense task that was before him. For seven years he and a
local lad restored and renovated the property employing many original
building techniques to achieve authenticity. They are particularly proud
of the roof which contains not one nail, being held together by wooden
pegs.
For guests, however, the experience begins on arrival when they are
led through the massive double oak doors and into a wood-pannelled,
flag-stone paved and candlelit reception area. After a while it may
require a pinch to determine whether you are really living through this
or dreaming. For around are curtains and tapestries, antiques, hundreds
of candles and an overwhelming visual reality that it is 1630.
Bedrooms, all seven, are furnished with antique furniture from a
specific period or country and each has a four-poster bed on which lies
a lute so that you may strike up a romantic note with your lady.
To dinner, but first a visit to the wardrobe. A selection of more than
40 costumes are available up to XXXL, leaving little excuse for not
joining in the adventure.
In the dining room the table is laid out seventeenth-century style
with crockery and glasses, original or reproduced, from that period. A
huge open fire helps light the room and has a spit on which a wild boar
has a regular role. Candles by the dozen assist the lighting and antique
furnishings create the atmosphere.
Bjorn's wife, Maria has not been at rest while her husband patiently
restored the property. She studied cookery books of the fifteenth,
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and has developed recipes, many of
which use original cooking techniques with little help from her modern
kitchen. Maria has been gifted with a love for her craft and this is
evident in the food she serves.
Expect to savour dishes such as onion and almond soup, home-smoked
salmon, small bird pie, olive of pork, gelatine of capon stuffed with
minced pork and figs and spices. And for dessert, cool rice cream and
raspberries in raspberry sauce served with freshly baked
seventeenth-century Shrewsbury biscuits can only be matched with the
delicious marigold and honey and saffron tart or traditional bread ice
cream.
It seems strange to be back in twentieth-century clothes and the
tights and breeches have been returned to the laundry to await the next
customer. But no sooner are we moving forward in time than we are
whisked back even further. And it was in Brother Cadfael's footsteps
that we had landed.
A Benedictine monk of the twelfth century, Cadfael was certainly
before the time of Miss Marple, however, his ability at solving
mysteries and murders has been given the modern treatment and its
commercial potential exploited. Cadfael Trails take the aspiring
detective to scenes of the crime and clue cards help to solve the
specially created mysteries.
In the south of the county is Aston-on-Clun, a small village at the
centre of which is a black poplar tree. Large flags decorate the tree
and each year, Arbor Day May 29, the flags are ceremonially renewed. It
is a custom that has been going on for more than 200 years and although
it indicates some kind of tree worship, villagers prefer to relate to a
wedding that took place in 1786 when the bride of the local squire gave
money to ensure its annual repetition.
Modern society seems ready to attach itself to much nonsense and twigs
from the poor old poplar became very popular as they were being promoted
as having fertility-inducing powers. The tree suffered some damage as a
the resultant clamour grasped for samples and the custom was almost
abandoned.
To abandon the past would see the end of The Sealed Knot Society, the
trug maker, Much Wenlock's Olympian Games and the goings on at Blists
Hill, howver, the good people of Shropshire know where they want to be.
Old Colehurst Manor from #115 per room includes breakfast and
afternoon tea. Six-course dinner for residents is #30.60. Party of four
persons for dinner is #46.80 per head, reducing as party size increases.

Sarajevo
AMERICAN envoy Richard Holbrooke said today the Bosnian Serbs faced
tough Nato action unless there was swift progress towards a negotiated
settlement of the Bosnian war.
Speaking before leaving for Europe to try to revive Washington's peace
initiative, he also said the onus was on Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to pressure Serbs in Bosnia to compromise.
''If this peace initiative does not get moving, dramatically moving in
the next week or two, the consequences will be very adverse to the
Serbian goals,'' Holbrooke, an assistant secretary of state, said on the
NBC News programme Meet the Press.
''One way or another Nato will be heavily involved, and the Serbs
don't want that. Nato will either assist the UN withdrawal or there will
be more active Nato air (sic) over the skies. These are not things the
Serbs should want.''
Holbrooke identified the Bosnian Serbs as the chief obstacle to a
peace settlement but did not make clear how Nato air strikes might be
used to force them to negotiate.
Nor was it clear how the US expected Milosevic to persuade Bosnia's
separatist Serbs to make the compromises necessary for them to be
invited to talks or what concessions they must make.
Holbrooke said Milosevic would have to make difficult decisions in the
next week. The Serbian president is desperate to have crippling trade
sanctions against Belgrade lifted, but he says he cannot force the
Bosnian Serbs to make peace.
The US peace team, reconstituted after a traffic accident outside
Sarajevo killed three key diplomats, was due to meet Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic in Paris tomorrow.
It will then attend a meeting of the ''Contact Group'' -- Britain,
France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- which has been trying
to coordinate peace efforts in Bosnia since 1994, before flying to
Belgrade to meet Milosevic.
Holbrooke has cautioned against high expectations. ''We've got a
window of opportunity which is small and a window of danger which is
large. It's an uphill struggle, but we are committed to it and we think
there's a chance,'' he said.
Washington has refused to reveal details of its plan but Holbrooke
said it maintained Bosnia's territorial integrity while allowing Bosnian
Serbs separate administration.
The Serbs would have to give up roughly 20% of the nearly
three-quarters of Bosnia they hold, something they have consistently
refused to do since war broke out when Sarajevo opted for independence
from Yugoslavia in 1992.
Holbrooke described this week's peace efforts as potentially decisive.
Diplomats say the United States has been spurred by the growing threat
of a United Nations withdrawal from Bosnia and worries over flashpoints
elsewhere in former Yugoslavia.
Croatia's recapture of swathes of rebel Krajina Serb land in early
August changed the balance of power, but Zagreb is now threatening
further campaigns.
President Franjo Tudjman has said Croatia's last rebel Serb enclave
will be retaken within months. If negotiations failed to win the region,
a new military offensive would do it, he said, despite the danger this
might spark war with Serbia.
Tudjman later told reporters he would give the US plan three to four
months to return Eastern Slavonia, bordering Serbia, to Croat control
before taking any offensive action.
Meanwhile, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said today Muslim
nations would meet in Malaysia next month to discuss supplying arms to
Bosnia.
Mahathir told reporters on returning from a visit to South Africa that
the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) contact group would
hold a special meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
''We will discuss this because we know that although we have agreed to
supply and sell weapons to Bosnia, the West will definitely stop us so
that the Bosnian Muslims will remain unarmed and can be easily
slaughtered by the Serbs,'' Mahathir said.
''This is what the Western people want,'' the Prime Minister said.
Defence Minister Syed Hamid Albar said yesterday the Kuala Lumpur
meeting, involving the foreign and defence ministers and armed forces
chiefs of the OIC contact group and member countries with troops in
Bosnia, would work out an initiative to end the war in the Balkan
republic.
Leaders of Bosnia and Croatia would also be invited to the meeting,
the defence minister said.
Malaysia has contributed over 1600 soldiers to the UN peacekeeping
force in Bosnia, the biggest contingent after Britain and
France.--Reuter.

IN an industry conscious of the need to maintain the highest standards
at every stage of the construction process, the successful manager on a
house-building site must be a man of many talents, allied to wide
experience.
His role has become increasingly complex over recent years with the
constant upgrading of building specifications and safety regulations.
Eric Purves, NHBC director, Scotland, says: ''While the Pride in the
Job Awards go to the managers, they cannot be achieved without a high
degree of teamwork, and the ability to motivate his team of tradesmen
towards a high level of workmanship is an essential quality in a site
manager.
''He must also be a diplomat. At a time when people are far more aware
of their rights and are more inquiring about their future home, he is
likely to be the first person contacted.
''Today's site manager must have a working knowledge of the many items
of equipment now supplied with new houses and flats, including
double-glazing, safety alarms, white goods in the kitchen and, in some
cases, carpeting and curtains.
''He must be able to control everything from laying the foundations to
the last lick of paint, and meanwhile run a safe and tidy site.''
One job the site manager doesn't have to do is fill in an entry form
for the Pride in the Job Awards. NHBC sites are automatically entered
and are assessed continually throughout the year by the NHBC inspectors
during their spot checks on new homes under construction.
Each site manager's work is evaluated -- from floors to roofs, from
plastering to plumbing -- using a marking sheet covering critical
building elements and awarding marks out of 10 for good building
practice.
Assessments also include safety procedures, and site managers lose
marks if workmen are seen not wearing safety hats.
As the Pride in the Job assessment is made on the basis of many
visits, allowing the inspector to examine the site at different stages
of development, this provides a complete defence to the ''You caught us
on a bad day,'' complaint.
This year, NHBC has introduced a new marking sheet which draws the
site team's attention to specific areas of construction where less than
adequate workmanship can lead to problems. It introduces a separate
section for the quality of foundations, and there are new marking
categories for workmanship in wall cavities.
In order to ensure that, as far as possible, like is being compared
with like, new award categories take account of company size, the degree
of off-site assistance that the site managers may enjoy, and special
difficulties under which they may work, such as restricted site access.
''The Pride in the Job Campaign, as with all other NHBC activities,
undergoes constant development over the years,'' says Eric Purves. ''No
other campaign within the building industry has been more instrumental
in raising standards of Scottish housebuilding.''
The three new categories, named after the classical orders of
architectural columns, are Doric, which applies to a company building
fewer than 30 homes a year and not affiliated to any group; Ionic,
applying to companies with an annual output of up to 200 homes; and
Corinthian, for builders with an annual output of more than 200 homes.

Phnom Penh
SOLDIERS guarding the home of Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen
opened fire and wounded a Briton, Australian and two Bulgarians early
today, some of the victims said.
A Hun Sen bodyguard said the incident occurred as security guards were
checking out a report that 100 troops loyal to First Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh were moving towards the capital.
It was later discovered that the troops were taking part in a military
exercise.
Englishman Greg James, 29, and Bulgarian Dimita Vaskov, 18, said in
Phnom Penh's Calmette Hospital that they and another Bulgarian were on a
motorcycle when the guards opened fire.
An Australian diplomat said a fourth foreigner, an unidentified
Australian, received a slight head wound during the fracas outside the
house.
Bulgarian Vrekyko Ivanov Zahov, 17, received serious head injuries in
a fall from a motorcycle and was expected to be flown to Bangkok for
treatment tomorrow.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said he had no knowledge of the
incident.
The bodyguard said security forces had been sent to beef up security
around the house of Hun Sen, who has the title of Second Prime Minister.
Hun Sen is a former member of the communist Cambodian People's Party.
Royalist leader Prince Ranariddh is the son of King Sihanouk.
Cambodia's rival factions agreed in 1991 to demobilise or disarm and
Sihanouk became head of state, but fighting continues in rural areas
between government forces and Khmer Rouge rebels.--Reuter.

EVERY buyer knows to look for the National House-Building Council's
Buildmark 10-year warranty when considering a new home, but not everyone
realises the immense amount of work undertaken on their behalf long
before they receive their Buildmark warranty and insurance documents as
a proud new owner.
''New homes continue to benefit from technological innovations, but
they remain largely a hand-built product from start to finish,'' points
out Eric Purves, the council's Scottish director.
''So the quality of your new home, and its overall performance
throughout its lifetime, rests to a great degree on the workmanship of
the men and women involved in the day-to-day housebuilding process. And
the key person in this process is the site manager.''
That is why the NHBC runs its annual Pride in the Job campaign, the
most prestigious award scheme in the UK house-building industry, which
recognises the importance of the role of the site manager and culminates
in the Pride in the Job Awards annual gala dinner in London.
Following an intense judging programme that began in July last year,
the names of Scotland's 28 Quality Award winning site managers have been
announced in the first stage of the 1995 Pride in the Job campaign.
As always, the competition has been tough, with more than 17,000
managers competing for just 400 awards presented throughout the UK.
Now in its 15th year, the campaign has been given a fresh perspective
designed to reflect the needs of today's housing industry and ensure the
award scheme is fair and impartial.
The timetable has been extended so that judging is now on a continuous
basis, starting from the July preceding the competition year. The
judging criteria have been revised to give more importance to
foundations and weather-proofing, and additional marks can be awarded to
take account of particular development difficulties.
The 28 winning site managers now progress to the second stage of the
competition as rigorous judging continues throughout Scotland to find
those site managers who have reached a Scottish shortlist and will
collect one of 200 Seals of Excellence awarded nationwide.
These awards will be announced at an awards lunch held at the Sheraton
Grand Hotel, Edinburgh, Friday, October 6. At this event, the shortlist
will be further reduced by competitive elimination to find the national
Scottish winners in each of three categories based on the size of their
companies.
These three site managers will then represent Scotland in the quest to
claim the ultimate industry accolade -- a UK Supreme Award.
Eric Purves comments: ''Pride in the Job glory is achieved through
sheer determination and the proven ability to construct new homes to a
standard which goes beyond the call of normal duty.

THE National House-Building Council (NHBC) was set up nearly 60 years
ago as the self-regulatory body of the private house-building industry,
and it has sought to improve quality in the industry ever since. It is a
private, non-profit distributing organisation, independent of the
Government.
The council of NHBC comprises all those organisations interested in
improving the standards of house-building, including mortgage lenders,
professional bodies, consumer groups and house-builders.
NHBC operates a nationwide network of offices, offering nationally
co-ordinated services delivered locally by its 750 employees. Today,
about 23,000 builders are NHBC registered -- including around 1400 in
Scotland -- and the large majority of new homes built for sale in the UK
benefits from NHBC services.
NHBC's work on behalf of the Scottish new homebuyer begins well before
a new home is put up for sale,
First, it carries out a thorough technical and financial check-up
before the builder is registered with the organisation. The builder
agrees to abide by the council's rules, as well as the NHBC technical
standards -- the bible of the house-building industry -- which provides
technical requirements and guidance on practical design, suitable
materials and quality of workmanship.
Once the builder and all the new homes it wishes to build are
registered, NHBC technical staff inspect every one of those flats or
houses. Spot checks are carried out throughout construction, helping to
ensure that the houses are being built to the standards and that the
builder gets all the advice and assistance he needs on site.
When the inspector is as sure as he can be that the house has been
built to NHBC standards the organisation will issue its world-famous
10-year warranty -- the Buildmark.
In addition to its regulatory role, NHBC is a registered insurance
company with more than #380m of reserves. Since the mid-sixties, more
than four million home owners have benefited from the peace of mind the
Buildmark provides.
The builder includes the one-off premium for the Buildmark in the
selling price of the house, and thereafter the warranty gives new-home
buyers 10 years of protection against loss in the following three main
ways:
Before completion: even before your builder begins construction, the
purchaser is protected. Should the builder become bankrupt before your
house is complete, NHBC will refund your deposit or protect you against
financial loss caused by incomplete and faulty construction, up to the
limit specified in the policy.
The first two years: under this part of the Buildmark protection, it
is the builder's responsibility to rectify breaches of NHBC standards.
You must report any faults in writing and, if he fails to rectify the
problem, NHBC will ensure that remedial work is undertaken.
Years three to 10: During this period, NHBC meets the cost of putting
right any major damage caused by a defect in the structure. This could
be serious problems in the foundations or other load-bearing parts of
the house, causing damage which requires partial or complete rebuilding
of the property.
The Buildmark warranty does not cover wear and tear, condensation and
shrinkage -- and neither does it relieve a homeowner of the duty to care
for and maintain the home. The warranty can, however, be passed on to a
second and subsequent purchasers of the home, within the 10-year period.
In partnership with the UK house-building industry, NHBC offers a
proven combination of risk management and comprehensive insurance cover.
Described by European Union experts as the most comprehensive and
cost-effective home insurance and purchaser protection scheme in Europe,
NHBC has been used as a model in many other countries, from Eire to
Australia.

WHEN the curtain goes up on the MacRobert Arts Centre's autumn season
at the beginning of next month, it will unveil a raft of innovative and
ambitious productions and performances with an accent on the young, plus
some big-name surprises.
An early feather in the campaign cap was Mel Brook's announcement that
he would attend the European premiere of his film Braveheart at the turn
of the month.
A second boost to prestige and profile came in the shape of Dame Diana
Rigg. She opens the season with a Gala Evening performance on September
8 of No Turn Unstoned. Based on her book of the same name, the evening
promises to be a celebration of survival in the theatre, revolving
around Diana's compilation of the worst-ever or funniest theatrical
reviews. The nasty, ill-informed, or just plain vitriolic notices were
donated to her by just about everyone who is anyone in showbusiness.
Not that Diana will have any qualms about facing critics in the
Stirling crowd. A well-kent face locally, she's also the centre's
chairman, and is ''very excited that at long last I have the opportunity
to perform on the stage of the arts centre with which I have been
associated for several years''.
Change has been taking place behind the scenes also. A new management
structure, and a completely refurbished studio theatre, sponsored by the
Bank of Scotland and the Friends of the MacRobert, are now in place to
compliment the new season, which includes drama, the best in European
contemporary dance, a specially produced opera project, a challenging
classical music series, pop, folk and jazz, plus a magical Christmas
show.
One highlight, and an early indication of the centre's interest in
work for and with young people, will be Mecklenburgh Opera's
co-production with the MacRobert of The Terezin Operas (October 19-21).
The Czechoslovakian transit camp at Terezin held Jews during the Second
World War. It also held Hans Krasa and Viktor Ullman, composers who
scored the downfall of tyranny in two one-act operas of optimism and
hope in the face of savage repression. Brundibar, by Krasa, is performed
by 40 young children from all over Central Region with Scotland's
premier contemporary orchestra, the Paragon Ensemble. It tells of a
bullying organ grinder who bans all music from the village except his
own. In Ullman's The Emperor of Atlantis, performed by six professional
opera singers, Death is sated with war and goes on strike, allowing the
power of love to conquer all.
If you're drawn to the company of those who know how to step out in
style, be sure to catch the Nederlands Dans Theatre 2. In the top six
dance companies in the world, October 27 and 28 are the only Scottish
dates for the group of 17-22-year-old dancers. The four ballets to be
performed, Un Ballo, Passomezzo, Petrol-Head Lover, and Solitaire, offer
showcases for very different styles, ranging from breakdancing to the
unique blend of exuberance and sensitivity which ganed NDT2 its
reputation and attracts the best young dancers from all over the world.
Innovation is also to the fore in TAG Theatre Company's adaptation of
Alasdair Gray's superb flight of imagination Lanark (September 12-16).
Set in 1950s Glasgow and the grim futuristic state of Unthank, Gray's
work is a huge holdall of ideas and philosophies crammed with literary
and classical allusions and by turns hilarious and horrific. But TAG
have had great success in adapting novels, most recently with A Scots
Quair and Gray has given them a free hand with the production, which
features an ensemble company of actors, musicians and singers.
Another modern novel adapted for the stage is the Tron Theatre
Company's adaptation of Janice Galloway's The Trick is to Keep Breathing
(October 3-7). Hailed in 1993 as a remarkable piece of theatre while
being performed as a work in progress, director Michael Boyd has pulled
the production into a tightly focused study of mind on the edge of the
edge.
The theme of childhood links three European plays aimed at the teenage
audience by The Oxford Stage Company (November 13-18). Mirad, A Boy From
Bosnia, deals with a 13-year-old fleeing Bosnia to start a new life in
Amsterdam, and his eventual return to the war zone.
Hitler's Childhood reminds us that all adults were once children and
that powerful forces are at work in our formative days, while Grace is a
magical comedy where a prince marries his Cinderella, a cleaning lady,
with disastrous consequences -- five years later he announces his
intention to hold another ball.
All this plus Stuart Paterson's adaptation of The Snow Queen, from
December 8 to January 6, adds up to a fascinating season of events in
Stirling, which will only add to the MacRobert Arts Centre's
well-established reputation as a first-class platform for the arts.

Cairo
ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation signed an agreement
here today transferring a wide range of administrative powers to
Palestinians in the West Bank, witnesses said.
The accord, part of a deal to expand Palestinian autonomy from Gaza to
the West Bank, was signed by PLO negotiator Jamil Tarifi and by Israel's
General Oren Shahor.
It covers the transfer of labour, trade and industry, gas and petrol,
insurance, postal services, statistics, agriculture and local
government.
Israel and the PLO are due to continue discussing the transfer of
authorities in some 32 other spheres to give Palestinians the kind of
control they have enjoyed in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of
Jericho since last year.
The two sides are believed to be several weeks away from full
agreement on implementing the second stage of the 1993
Palestinian-Israeli self-rule accord -- an Israeli troop redeployment in
the occupied West Bank and the holding of Palestinian elections.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the continued
closure of self-ruled Jericho today to pressure the PLO to hand over two
Hamas militants suspected of involvement in a deadly bus bombing,
security sources said.
Palestinian officials said the two Hamas men had been tried and
sentenced in the West Bank enclave of Jericho on Friday and would not be
surrendered.
Jericho was sealed off from the rest of the West Bank last Wednesday,
two days after a Hamas suicide bomber killed four passengers on a
Jerusalem bus.
* Israeli air force jets launched two raids against Muslim guerrilla
targets on a south Lebanon mountain ridge today, security sources said.
There was no immediate report on casualties in the raid, the 26th into
Lebanon this year.--Reuter.

WOMEN often receive far less from their late husband's occupational
pension scheme than they expect, but at least if he died before he
retired she can also expect the scheme to pay out a lump sum benefit
(usually of between two and four times his salary).
If her husband dies after he retires this extra life assurance benefit
falls away and she will have to rely on her widow's pension.
What few women realise is that even this income can be taken away from
them, as Mrs Barnum found out to her cost.
After five years of widowhood, Mrs Barnum found a step-father for her
children and the prospect of lonely years of widowhood was put behind
her.
Her new husband was not wealthy but they had the security of her
widow's pension from her late husband who had been a policeman for 30
years until just a year before his untimely death.
With her new husband she had a wonderful holiday and returned,
refreshed and relaxed, to take up their new life.
Soon after their return, the proverbial brown envelope hit the
doormat. It effectively said: ''Congratulations on your marriage. As Mr
Barnum's widow you are entitled to a widow's pension of #440.50 per
month.
''As you no doubt know this pension was payable to you until such time
as you remarried. Now that you have remarried these payments will stop
with immediate effect. We hope you have many years of happily married
life ahead of you.''
Mrs Barnum's ''crimes'' were:
* She was married to a man who died just after he retired, rather than
just before he retired. However, had he died before retirement she still
would have lost the pension;
* He had worked in the public sector rather than the private sector;
* She had not read, or had explained to her, the small print of her
late husband's pension scheme.
This Kafkaesque situation is not a spoof -- it is real -- although the
words of the letter have been changed. As you can imagine Mrs Barnum was
shattered.
''How can this be right?'' she says. ''My husband worked for 30 years
to build up our financial security for retirement. I have now lost all
the income which I have been receiving since he died.
''I assumed once this sort of payment was made it could not be
stopped. I am both broke and angry. I have been penalised just because I
wanted to remarry.''
Research by the National Association of Pension Fund has concluded
that in the public sector 21% of schemes continue to pay the pension on
remarriage and 79% of schemes cease payment to a widow of an employee if
she subsequently remarries.
In the private sector 88% of schemes continue to pay the pension on
remarriage. and 7% of schemes stop paying the widow's pension if she
remarries at any time.
Two per cent of schemes stop paying if she remarries before age 60 and
3% of schemes may stop paying but ''treat each case on its merits''.
So for women whose husbands worked in the public sector there is an
eight in ten chance that what they see, quite rightly, as ''their''
income will be stopped if they remarry, even in the private sector there
is a one in 10 chance that they will lose their income.
What should widows do if they want to get remarried?
* Don't -- live in sin instead! Even that may not work, as some public
sector pension funds will stop paying a pension if they find out the
widow is ''cohabiting''.
* Find out the facts -- before committing themselves to another
marriage they need to find out, if it has not been clearly pointed out,
whether or not they will be caught in this anachronistic and inequitable
trap.
Although it is time this ludicrous situation is legislated against it
is indicative, along with the Government's resistance to changing the
pensions law in relation to divorce, of an outmoded attitude which
implies that an occupational pension plans is 'his' rather than 'their'
deferred income.
The fact that pensions are allowed to continue to be organised in this
way is reminiscent of a Victorian code of morality where the wife is
seen as a chattel, and the husband or his employer only has any
responsibility for her while she wears widow's weeds.
Any wife married to a man older than herself, or who just might want
the option of remarrying should make sure she checks the rules of her
husband's pension arrangement.
As Mrs Barnum says: ''My previous husband would never have wanted to
stop me getting remarried and grasping whatever happiness I could get.
'' If only we had known this when he was still working, maybe we could
have saved money differently instead of contributing everything into his
pension.''

Financial Independence published in June.

Tokyo, Sunday -- Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama plans to
submit to parliament on October 5 a second supplementary Budget for the
current fiscal year to stimulate the sluggish economy, Kyodo news
service reported today.
Kyodo quoted a senior official of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
as saying the Japanese parliament would be called back for an
extraordinary session on September 29 and the Government hoped the
supplementary budget would be passed one week later.
''The Government must compile a Budget exceeding 10 trillion yen to
stop a decline in the economy,'' Kyodo quoted LDP secretary general
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka as saying.
Japan is experiencing a stubborn recession that shows little sign of
ending. -- Reuter

WHAT better way to celebrate 50 years in the building industry than
with your second NHBC Pride in the Job Quality Award? That's the
achievement of George Rogers, 64-year-old site manager at The Cedars,
McCarthy &amp; Stone's development of retirement flats in Corstorphine,
which was opened in June by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Norman Irons.
When George began work as a 14-year-old apprentice to Stockbridge
jobbing joiner John Fraser, his wage was 16s (80p) a week, and the only
powered tool used in the trade was a circular saw - everything else was
strictly hands on.
His five-year apprenticeship was followed by three years in airfield
construction in the Middle East while serving with the Royal Air Force.
Back in Edinburgh, he joined T Boland &amp; Co as a joiner, was promoted to
chargehand and then spent the remaining nine years of his 14 years with
the firm as site agent - the forerunner of today's site manager.
His next job, as site agent with civil engineers W &amp; JR Watson, West
Calder, was another 14-year stint, which included winning an NHBC Award
in 1982 for the Riding Park site at Barnton, Edinburgh.
Then in 1984 George joined McCarthy &amp; Stone, where The Cedars has
turned out to be the fastest-selling development in the company's
18-year history as retirement builders, with just one flat left to sell.
He says: ''I arrived on site in June last year to demolish, started
brick work in August, and occupation began at the end of June this year.
Not bad for a three-storey building with 39 flats, and 290-odd hours
lost through bad weather.''
George's toughest challenge at The Cedars was constructing the
circular turrets that adorn three of the flats. ''We had to get a
special crane to lift them into place, and then build the pre-formed
sandstone blocks around them,'' he says. ''It wasn't easy, but the
effect is very good.
''I'm delighted to have won another NHBC Award. It's the buyer who
benefits at the end of the day from Pride in the Job, and if you
purchase a McCarthy &amp; Stone flat you can be sure its construction has
been well monitored.
''We keep a site record book in which the NHBC inspector records his
visits and comments on any faults - which have to be put right. When
construction is complete, the record book is kept by the company and it
can be referred to in case of any complaint.
''We also have supervision from our own construction manager two or
three times a week, and from our architect and consultant civil
engineer.''
Having come up the hard way, George Rogers believes in sticking to
basics - like keeping a clean and tidy site.
''Everyone has really got to get the message right from the start. As
soon as you let a site get untidy, with materials all over the place,
you may as well go home as far as quality workmanship is concerned.''
The outspoken McCarthy &amp; Stone manager believes there is another
important aspect to a well-run site.
''Safety is at a premium in the building industry now, with the new
CDM (Construction Design and Management) Regulations, but building sites
are only as safe as you make them. A tidy site is normally a safe site.
George is a firm believer that to be a successful site manager you
have to come up through the trades, and he reckons that being a joiner
is a good starting point as the joiner is always involved with other
trades.
He is not a great believer in the current trend to train young
graduate civil engineers as site managers because, as he puts it,
''whatever else you have learned, if you don't know how to handle
brickies, joiners and plumbers, you're on a hiding to nothing.''

THE gas repairman is going hi-tech, with engineers now carrying a
laptop computer with them as well as their toolbox when they call to fix
faulty central heating and gas fires.
The service side of British Gas, which is a separate division within
the group, is being modernised, with Scotland in the vanguard for the
changes ahead. All British Gas Service engineers are being equipped with
a Panasonic CD-ROM personal computer which has been specially toughened
to withstand the rigours of being bumped around vans.
The servicing business is being extensively reshaped and managing
director David Wells reckons his company is two-thirds of the way
through the process.
''We've got all the pieces of the jigsaw and now it is just a case of
putting the pieces together,'' he said.
The hope is to improve on levels of service but there is a downside to
this -- the computers will also generate instant bills so that the
engineer himself can collect the money straight away. However, most of
the three million British Gas Service customers are covered under
contracts so are normally not charged for call-outs.
The computers are currently used as expert systems, enabling the
engineer to diagnose and deal with unusual problems without referring to
others. They can also be used to play games -- but only after working
hours of course.
The large capacity of the CD-ROMS enables detailed technical
information to be on tap for all makes of equipment. But this is only
one of their functions.
Soon service centres will be beaming call-out instructions straight to
the machines so that at the touch of a button the engineer will know his
daily timetable without any phone calls being necessary. If he does not
carry the necessary part in his van he will be able to order it directly
with the computer.
Eventually there will be just one parts centre in Leicester covering
the whole country and parts will be sent out overnight by the Post
Office for collection at drop points by the engineer the following
morning.
All this means is that the number of support staff can be drastically
reduced and around 10,000 jobs will be lost, though all on a voluntary
basis and some employees have been transferred to other parts of the gas
industry.
It is a typical example of what the information age is all about and
why the service sector is being hit so hard by job cuts.
The new system is being put in place first in Scotland. About 100 more
people are being taken on at the British Gas office in Uddingston to
provide the national administration for contracts and billing. If the
spares delivery system is found to be failing distant parts of the
country like Scotland then some subsidiary spares depots may be left in
place.
British Gas had many customer complaints last winter and Mr Wells
accepts that the telephone appointments system was overwhelmed at times.
But he does claim that their surveys did show that customers were
satisfied by the work done.
The new system is expected to improve on the punctuality of repair
visits, which gives rise to the largest number of complaints. Contract
customers will receive a visit the same day if they telephone before
7.30 in the morning and there will be several appointment time-bands.
Under consideration is a two to four-hour call-out time for a small
extra charge.
New employment contracts, which received a strong endorsement from the
labour force, mean that appointments can be made at weekends and up to
9pm during the week to suit the working couple.
Customers have suffered at times because of the radical shake-up in
British Gas, which is moving to a divisional structure by function
rather than by geography. This is being driven by competition and the
need to satisfy regulatory requirements, notably the separation of the
gas pipeline system (TransCo) from the rest of the group, to facilitate
new gas supply entrants.
The change has to be completed by the time the market is fully open to
competition next April, when even domestic consumers will be able to
choose their supplier.
The changes are likely to cause some confusion to consumers. For
example if a gas cooker is bought from a gas showroom it is not British
Gas Service which will install it but an outside contractor. Nor will a
British Gas engineer repair a cooker or any other appliance supplied by
a company shop. Increasingly manufacturers are making both gas and
electric appliances and establishing their own service networks
repairing both kinds of appliances.
British Gas Service has decided to concentrate on central heating, hot
water systems and gas fires. But it will be still involved in the
installation of heating systems and bathrooms, though mainly through
sub-contractors.
The other area of possible confusion concerns the most important fault
of all, gas leaks. When an emergency is reported, it is a technician
from the pipeline company, TransCo, who will appear on the doorstep.
He is responsible for problems up to the customer's meter but will
also render a leaking appliance safe and do what he can to rectify the
fault -- until he has spent half an hour. When this time is up he will
ask the customer whether he wants British Gas Service or an independent
engineer to finish the repair.
Mr Wells insists safety is paramount and there clearly has to be a
break point somewhere between where TransCo's responsibilities end and
Service's begin. But it does seem an area where confusion could occur,
with potentially dangerous consequences.

Moscow, Sunday -- Russian banks face a new test this week after the
central bank injected cash into the economy to ease a severe credit
crunch.
The central bank and Government said their actions would be enough to
calm the crisis, which sparked fears of bank closures or mergers, but
Russian markets, still slow to react to events, reserved judgment.
Some economists and officials said such problems were common in
economies in transition and were partly a result of Russia's success in
achieving a measure of stabilisation.
The non-payments crisis arose after some banks stopped lending,
fearing they would not get their money back. On Thursday, overnight
interest rates soared to 1000% from Wednesday's 300%. The interbank
credit market froze.
The central bank made 300 billion roubles of short-term credits
available to the banks. It also bought Treasury bills worth one trillion
roubles on Friday to pump extra cash into the market.
Despite this, the credit market remained comatose but acting central
bank head Tatyana Paramonova told a news conference the situation should
be back to normal by tomorrow or Tuesday.
However, the respected Sevodnya daily said on the weekend that doubts
remained about whether the action would be enough to revive the market
and that further cash injections could mean higher inflation and a
weakening of financial policy.
Russia has cut monthly inflation from 17.8% in January to 5.4% in July
and expects further falls.
First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said the credits would not
be inflationary or derail economic reform.
Moscow agreed strict targets for credit issue with the International
Monetary Fund as a condition for the release of a $6400m standby loan
earlier this year.
''We have not once, not for one month, not for one day, broken the
terms of the standby . . . For us these are principal limits from which
we will not depart,'' Mr Chubais said.
The Kommersant Daily financial newspaper commented on Saturday that
the Government could not have ignored the crisis with parliamentary
elections due in December.
''To allow the collapse of fairly large banks on the eve of elections
would have meant practically giving away most votes to the left-wing
opposition,'' it said.
Some bankers said the crisis, however it was resolved, heralded a
shake-out of the system. ''The time is ripe for a restructuring of the
banking system,'' one told Sevodnya.
Mr Chubais said the Government would set up a working group to look at
the restructuring of the banking sector.
Russia has almost 3000 banks, many of them little more than currency
exchange operations. But many have survived because of big returns on
rouble instruments in a time of high inflation.
With inflation falling, rouble instruments are less profitable while
high interest rates are making it hard for companies to repay loans. --

George Hume explains why Highland filling stations may be exterminated
SCOTLAND'S remote rural petrol stations, facing extinction as a result
of cut-price hypermarket competition and expensive environment and
safety standards, may be replaced by unmanned robot pumps controlled
from up to 50 miles away. All that motorists will need will be a credit
card, but they will have to wipe midges from their windscreens
themselves.
The number of filling stations in the Highlands and Islands has fallen
from 348 to 200 in just two years and most of the remaining sites have
equipment that is at least 30 years old -- likely to be ruled as ''high
risk'' and in need of substantial upgrading. Trade experts calculate
that by the turn of the century traditional filling stations still
operating in the remoter parts of the Highlands will number just a few
dozen.
Throughout the country 998 filling stations closed last year. In all,
3500 remaining small rural sites are considered to be at risk -- each
located at least eight miles from a town with a population of 4000 or
more. Twenty per cent of the 17,000 petrol stations in Britain could
close in the next 10 years.
But some filling stations far removed from hypermarkets, protected by
their distance from towns, are holding their own. Colin MacDonald, of
Morar Motors, 46 miles from Fort William, said: ''It is not viable for
motorists from this area to go into Fort William to buy cut-price
petrol. We are able to hold our customers and make a turn on the
trade.''
The operators of remote area filling stations closer to towns are,
however, suffering a two-pronged attack. First, hypermarkets are able to
heavily undercut the prices that have to be charged by small traders
with a modest throughput on their forecourt. Secondly, an impending
safety review could leave the small operators facing modernisation bills
of up to #150,000.
To meet environmental improvements alone, the operators of most remote
Highland petrol stations would have to spend up to #30,000 for twin-wall
storage tanks and a further #7000 for vapour recovery systems.
Now a health and safety steering group set up by the Department of the
Environment is looking at the possibility of changes in the licensing
regulations governing petrol stations with a view to allowing
robot-operated pumps to be set up in the corner of a farm field or
beside a lay-by.
Able to be moved about on the back of a lorry, the pump and its
electronic equipment would be put down on a specially prepared site,
simple to move elsewhere if local demand failed to make it viable.
According to Bruce Petter, director of the Petroleum Retailers'
Association and a member of the health and safety steering group, the
plight of petrol stations in the Highlands is ''serious''. Lateral
thinking, he says, could keep the local population supplied with petrol
from above-ground storage at robot stations -- up to eight satellite
stations, fitted with card readers and a modem, controlled from a
computer centre as far as 50 miles away.
''People in remote rural districts are absolutely dependent on their
cars and we are very concerned about the apparently unstoppable decline
in the number of traditional filling stations in these areas,'' says
Petter. ''But set against modest sales and supermarket competition,
given the cost of modernising very old equipment and meeting modern
safety and environmental standards, investment to allow them to carry on
just does not make sense.''
The robot stations, he says, would be well lit for security, fitted
with automatic closedown, have overflow bunkers well able to take the
entire contents of a petrol tank if it were to leak, and be surrounded
by earth bunds to contain blast in the event of an explosion.
Unmanned robot truck stops serving diesel -- and not requiring a
licence -- operate up and down the country, allowing drivers to fuel
their vehicles at any hour. Petrol stations, on the other hand, have to
be licensed under the Petroleum Consolidation Act of 1928, brought in
after 35 deaths when a load of petrol in tins exploded in London.
Robot petrol stations could be set up in the Highlands, says Petter,
at a cost of about #15,000 each. ''All that is needed is a small piece
of land, a supply of electricity, and a telephone line. Self-contained,
no digging and, alas, no staff -- but one way of keeping a petrol supply
in remote areas.''

Milan, Sunday -- Italy could be taking an unnecessary gamble if it
takes the lira back into the European monetary system prematurely, a
senior economist with Deutsche Bank was quoted as saying.
''My personal opinion is that you would be better off waiting,''
Norbert Walter told Rome's La Repubblica newspaper in an interview.
''There is time until the autumn of 1996 to take part in monetary
union,'' he added.
Budget Minister Rainer Masera said on Friday the current lira exchange
rate against the mark could be a basis for negotiating the Italian
currency's reentry into the European exchange rate mechanism.
Prime Minister Lamberto Dini is also known to be in favour of taking
the lira back into the EMS later this year.
The lira closed on Friday at around 1100 lira against the mark.
''To re-enter now in such a hurry is too risky, it could provoke the
markets before the last political uncertainties disappear. No, it is
better to use the time available before taking the chance,'' Walter told
Repubblica.
Mr Walter, one of Germany's leading economists, said Italian exports
retained a strong competitive edge despite the recent strengthening of
the lira against the mark.
''There is still a margin of a good five percent by which it (the
lira) can strengthen and exports remain very competitive.''
He also said Italy could be in a position to lower interest rates as
long as it did not lose sight of the need to put its public finances in
order.
''If you do not lose sight of the conditio sine qua non of reordering
public finances, the tendency on international markets is towards
stabilisation with falling rates.''
Milan financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore quoted a report by German
research economic research institute IFO as saying it would be
unrealistic for the lira to reenter the EMS before the end of the year.
IFO believed Italy did not have room to bring down interest rates soon
because the lira was still a weak currency vulnerable to dollar
volatility, Il Sole said.
* ITALIAN Prime Minister Lamberto Dini has sought the go-ahead from a
high court to offer shares to the public in state oil company ENI
without waiting for a regulatory authority to be set up, news reports
said.
Mr Dini wanted to be sure that a first batch of shares in ENI could be
sold without a special authority being established to regulate ENI's gas
production and distribution interests and had sought the opinion of the
State Council. -- Reuter

James Freeman Home Affairs Correspondent, talks to the Scottish
Secretary about proposals for the prison service which aim to tackle
both rehabilitation and punishment of offenders
IT DID not take long for Michael Forsyth to get the gloves off in
relation to crime. The messages he is sending out are clear and as
hard-line as Scots would expect them to be, yet underlying the
soundbites, which can only be expected with the conference season
approaching, there is an unexpectedly thoughtful and constructive
thread.
The new Scottish Secretary seems, at first blush, to be tempering Home
Office dogma by indicating a willingness to take the best of it for a
Scottish context while leaving aside the dafter excesses of Howard's
''magic bullet'' solutions.
A cynic might say that Forsyth will concentrate on the prisons in the
coming months because that is the only part of the criminal justice
process to which he has direct access and, therefore, the only component
of the system where he can demonstrate his toughness on crime.
The police force has probably had enough political interference for a
generation, which leaves the judges and the courts. It will be
interesting to watch his efforts to secure improvements for the public
in those areas.
Forsyth has arrived at a time when the planning of Scotland's first
private prison -- financed, built and run by the private sector -- is
advancing, designed to take the heat out of projected overcrowding in
excess even of the current high prison numbers.
''I start from the standpoint that the prison service has to provide
the places to meet all the disposals of the courts and we cannot have an
approach which says that the policy of the courts to criminals has to be
driven by the availability of prison places. There is an absolute duty
to see that we provide places and provide prisons where the staff are
able to run effective regimes.
''The experience in the South has been that private sector design,
build, and finance has resulted in us getting prisons which are very
much less expensive, very much easier to manage, and which have been
constructed very much more quickly than they were in the past. This
policy can find capital for prison service development at a time when
prisons are competing with schools and hospitals. For understandable
reasons, the public sympathy is always with schools and hospitals.
''I want to see additional capacity in the prison service achieved as
quickly as possible to accommodate the disposals of the courts and to
relieve overcrowding,'' Forsyth said.
He went on to allay the fears of Scottish prison staff that his Home
Office background would inevitably mean a return to market testing of
prison functions and whole prisons for private sector participation.
The service would continue to be required to make savings from greater
efficiency, he said, but what had been achieved -- a reference to the
staffing structure review which created a two-tier grading system for
front-line prison officers and those with no direct prisoner contact --
was an acceptable compromise.
He did not think it would be right for him to interfere with the
arrangements reached by his predecessors, Ian Lang and Lord Fraser. If
the prison service did not deliver, it would be right to revisit the
idea of market testing, he said, but it would not be right to create a
feeling of uncertainty because the Secretary of State had changed.
The courts' sentencing policy, Forsyth said, was a matter for them and
he would not suggest otherwise.
But he was keen to see that the courts were aware of the widespread
public feeling that there must be penalties which fitted the crimes and
he was ''not at all sympathetic to the notion that we must have
limitations on custody because of capacity constraints on the prison
system''.
In this respect, Forsyth showed he was aware of the current purge on
drug dealers in Strathclyde and expressed support and praise for the
policies of Leslie Sharp, Strathclyde's chief constable, some of whose
initiatives were being copied in England, let alone in Scotland.
''We really have to show no quarter to those involved in supply of
drugs. Prison is the only appropriate place for them and I would like to
see the courts imposing long sentences and using the powers we have
given them to take away their assets,'' he declared.
The drugs issue raised more complex questions, however. There was no
point imprisoning people for misusing drugs if the prisons were not
actually able to provide them with support to help them get off drugs.
While ruthlessness was called for in dealing with suppliers, it had to
go hand-in-hand with demand reduction and education.
Prison, he said, was about punishment and the protection of the
public, and a large part of that was putting people back into the
community who were less of a threat.
''I want to see if we can here in Scotland crack a problem which
people struggle with around the world -- trying to work out effective
regimes and programmes which are successful in preventing reoffending,''
he stated.
Research had to be undertaken to measure success. He had been
impressed in England by the work undertaken at Grendon with sex
offenders, work which he was aware was also going ahead at Peterhead
Prison on a successful Canadian model. He acknowledged that these
programmes did not always attract proper credit because they run against
peoples' prejudices.
Turning to drugs in prison, Forsyth said there was now a possibility
of people entering prison and actually being introduced to drugs, which
was absolutely unacceptable. People were saying that it was not possible
to stamp out drugs in prison but, he promised, there were ways they
could do it.
''Drugs misuse in prison has to be stopped and people held to account
for it. But it is more than just a matter of identifying misuse; it is
about also having in place proper programmes to help prisoners get off
drugs,'' he said.
The resource implications were positive if people were prevented from
going back inside, he believed, adding that keeping a prisoner in a
Scottish jail for a year costs 10% more than in England. Emphasising
that better use had to be made of time in prison, he said he was pushing
at an open door as far as the SPS was concerned.
While advocating this greater range of treatment programmes, Forsyth
made an unexpected plea to tabloid editors who whip up hysteria about
allegedly soft regimes.
''I very much hope that the tabloid media would actually try to play a
part, to explain to the public what it is we are trying to do. The
public is concerned about the effects of crime, and rehabilitation work
is an important part of addressing that concern,'' he said. ''At the
same time I do not think that prisons should be a place where you have
access to facilities that you could only dream about if you lead an
honest life.''
Many young offenders, he had found in England, were pathetic young men
-- ''lost souls many of them, unable to read and write, getting into
early truanting, finding themselves unable to hold down a job and then
drifting into drugs''.
While it was not possible to succeed with all of them, he said, he
wanted to address the problems. It would take time to put regimes in
place and monitor them.
He believed in diverting people who should plainly not be jailed --
fine defaulters for example -- away from prison, but, he mused, might it
not be more appropriate to rename community service orders as community
punishment orders.
''There has to be an element of punishment, and in the coming months I
will be satisfying myself that there is,'' he said. He was concerned
also that the public should be satisfied on sentencing questions that
punishments should fit the crime, and that offenders should not be seen
to achieve release too early in their sentence.
There was an indication that he might, before long, be examining the
current Scottish remission arrangements. He was also keen to establish
good relationships with people interested in prisons, he said.
''People who want reform are often pigeonholed as do-gooders and those
who believe there should be an element of punishment as unthinking
right-wingers. But it is possible, I believe, to have rehabilitation and
punishment going hand-in-hand. There is much common ground.''
''People who want reform are often pigeonholed as
do-gooders and those who believe there should be
an element of punishment as unthinking
right-wingers.''

Madrid, Sunday -- The Bank of Spain is likely to freeze interest rates
until after the Government presents its 1996 budget to parliament in
late September, Secretary of State for the Economy Alfredo Pastor said.
''What the Bank of Spain does will depend firstly on inflation data
for August and September . . . and secondly, we have to see how the
budget is greeted in parliament,'' Mr Pastor said in an interview today.
''If data is positive on both these fronts, the markets themselves
will give the signal for a rate cut,'' he said.
Asked when the Bank of Spain might consider trimming rates, Mr Pastor
said: ''I'd be thinking of the middle of October.''
The central bank's key money rate stands at 9.25%.

HER conversation can call upon a Who's Who of Britain's entertainment
industry workforce for more than five decades but Billie Whitelaw is not
precious, she is professional. Just when you are running through names
like Olivier, Joan Littlewood, Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, and
playwright Samuel Beckett, with whom she collaborated for a quarter of a
century, she happily announces: ''I was in the first Dixon of Dock
Green.''
Indeed she was and in so, so much else. Leeds and Leicester and
London, the Royal Court, the Royal Shakespeare Company; she was on stage
with Albert Finney and in films like Charlie Bubbles and Gumshoe. She
was the gangsters' mother in The Krays five years ago and directed by
Zeffirelli in Jane Eyre this year. She's been a child star -- age 11 --
and a pin-up, and a kitchen sink dramas sex symbol, and a lecturer at
universities across America. She's been directed by John Ford and Joseph
Losey and pursued by more young -- and old -- actors and directors and
other tempted types than she cares to name or remember.
She insists it was her work with Beckett which had publishers pursuing
her -- for purely artistic reasons -- for a decade to write her
autobiography. ''I'm under no illusion about that,'' she says in a soft
voice that has spoken spectacular words over the years.
Now, she has written some. But it is only when you glance at the
credits at the end of Billie Whitelaw . . . who he? that memory is again
alerted to the amount of work she had done. Presumably to help forest
conservation they have only listed ''a selection'' of her work in
theatre, film, television and radio.
We can argue it is that, and her remarkable personal story, which
attracted publishers as much as her working relationship with Beckett.
She sits in the garden of her paradise of a Suffolk cottage -- there is
a flat in Hampstead and a studio in Cannes but this is her most
''permanent bolt-hole'' -- and, at 62, seems settled. Content is not a
word that would jump out of the dictionary at her.
Her neck is bothering her (it has since she was 23) but it makes a
painful nuisance rather than cancellations in her schedule. It's clear
that for her the show has always gone on.
There was a reading from her book at the Edinburgh Festival on
Saturday night and a hectic round of engagements involved with its
publication will follow in the next weeks. She also expects to be a
grandmother in November and sits in one of her low-beamed, burrow-type
cottage rooms playfully joking around with a pink-eared cuddly rabbit
toy (she has a collection) which she says ''will be useful soon''.
It was something she never thought would happen. ''I keep being asked
how to play witches and grandmothers, but a real life granny? It's
wonderful. I'm so looking forward to it.''
The role has special significance for her. Following what she calls
her ''hobnailed divorce'' from the actor Peter Vaughan (also a believer
in the work ethic and a familiar face in film and television for as long
as his former wife) after 14 years of marriage, she met the writer
Robert Muller at the home of Bob Monkhouse in early 1966. He was married
with two young daughters but his relationship was also cracking-up.
Their son Matthew was born a year later and his image jumps from the
walls of their cottage. In the upstairs bathroom, the comfortable
bedroom with views of open land all around. His picture is up there with
posters from plays his mother was in and next to photographs and
paintings which reflect his father's European background: as a
13-year-old he arrived in Britain as a refugee from the Nazis in 1933.
Matthew, stage manager of the Pavilion Opera Company, grinning next to
his girlfriend Nicola is on a wall glanced over by a photograph of
Samuel Beckett. Her son was five when a desperate battle to save his
life began. She was making the film Night Watch with Elizabeth Taylor
who was having problems with Richard Burton and the late Laurence Harvey
who was suffering from cancer. Her son had bacterial meningitis. Death
was, not perhaps, but probable.
Billie Whitelaw got the pills and what she calls ''everything else''
to hand in preparation to commit suicide should Matthew die. The chances
were strong that he would.
''It wasn't because I couldn't bear to face life without Matthew but
in a quite practical, unemotional way I thought it would be better if I
went with him in case he got lost if he died. When he would go wherever
one goes he'd be too little to manage on his own. Afterwards I thought
what a rotten thing to do to Robert. But I decided that Matthew would
need me more because he was only five years old . . .''
Her son survived but it was only on his 10th birthday that he was
taken off the ''at risk'' register. For five years his parents devoted
themselves to one job -- their son. As he slowly got better his treat
was to kick around a football at Upton Park with his hero the late Bobby
Moore. Billie Whitelaw remains a West Ham fan. But she had more medical
troubles. Robert Muller, who wrote two plays for her and works in German
and English, suffered a series of massive heart attacks which almost
killed him before he was 60.
But she coped: ''Albert Finney once told me, 'Whitelaw you're like a
Yorkshire pit pony -- you never give up.' ''
She sits sipping her mug of tea looking out over her series of
''secret gardens'' which are hidden behind hedges and carefully placed
trees in a garden that is only four years old but ''old''. Her attitude
to the gardeners and designers who told her that it would take 15 years
to create was: ''I haven't got the time.'' It has worked well and she
has a nineteenth-century green-painted railway car as her ''summer
house''. It is being renovated and she has the original lamps which will
go with it.
She's a collector. Of hats and cuddly toys and posters, paintings,
postcards and people. She is a close friend of Eric Lomax whose story of
his horror with the Japanese is told in his book The Railway Man -- as
it was on TV with John Hurt as Lomax -- and she is reading it in her
railway carriage. She met Eric Lomax through her charity work for
''Victims of Torture''. She'd rather flog copies of his book than her
own, she says. It is more important. There is no Luvvie-speak in this.
In fact, she is remarkably non-theatrical given her journey from
Bradford to trouble at mill dramas to Olivier's Desdemona background and
all the Samuel Beckett muse accolades. Irish writer Beckett's work --
Waiting for Godot has been and is performed around the world -- is
eccentric and has been controversial. There is no easy access to it even
for the star who worked with him for 25 years.
She pushes back her grey hair which remains thick as a scrubbing brush
as she sits at an astrologer's table in her garden. ''The Americans
invite me over to lecture on Beckett. They think I'm an expert. I'm not.
I can take his work and read it and perform it. But I never pretend I
can analyse it. I always understood the feelings inside myself that he
wanted to say even if I didn't understand the words.
''It was in here,'' she says stabbing at her chest.
She is 5ft 1in tall which just gets her in the back door of her
cottage without bending. Of course, she has not been in the habit of
bowing down to anyone. She is proud of being direct and determined. But
it wasn't always so and still after all the years of work, she suffers
from stage fright.
Her marriage to Peter Vaughan was complex and difficult and they never
really resolved their differences until the funeral of actor Donald
Pleasance this year. He had been a very good friend. One afternoon in
the mid-1950s she came home to find a strange man in her kitchen cooking
cauliflower. Her husband told her: ''Oh, this is my friend Donald
Pleasance, he's got marital problems. He's going to stay with us for a
few weeks.''
Seven years later their ''house guest'' was still with them.
''I did feel so resentful about my divorce with Peter because I tried
to go twice and I came back because he was miserable. I should never
have gone and he just went off with somebody else. Seeing him at
Donald's funeral, I suppose both of us sharing that pain, we were able
to give each other a hug and it was a genuine, warm hug and all that
resentment of the divorce had gone.''
Much stronger than her first marriage was her time with Beckett: ''It
was a 25-year quite unique relationship.
''We just got on and he once was asked: 'Why do you like working with
Billie Whitelaw?' And he said: 'Because she doesn't ask me a lot of damn
fool questions!' ''
She's the straightforward sort: ''My parents were Liverpudlian
although I was actually brought up in Yorkshire. That is where my roots
are, where my heart is, not that I'd ever go back. Never go back. My
home is where my suitcase is and the photographs of my family, and with
a little luck my husband. I do live in sort of globules of the present
in my own sort of time warp,'' she says.
Her book is a practical rather than esoteric account of her life. It
could have been racier, a wonderful kiss'n'tell: ''Oh yes, I could have
written a totally different sort of book. Without question. Of course I
could.
''I had endless affairs when I was younger. Endless. You would find it
very interesting but I feel there are various things that I can't write.
It would hurt too many people and I haven't got the right to do that.
''There's a totally different book to be written but that has to be
done when a number of people are dead I think.''
She says she and her husband believe they have earned the time now to
relax somewhat. She says he has not earned ''mega bucks'' but says she
has got nothing against big cheques and after years of work her
lifestyle is extremely comfortable. But the money thing concerns her:
''The latest Kevin Costner release -- if you've made the most expensive
movie ever that's a great selling point. But having been brought up with
Joan Littlewood that is totally alien to me.
''I would not say no if anybody wrote me out a mega-buck cheque, but
then I know that sort of world would kill me for I have no respect for
it. I don't think I'm talking from envy or sour grapes because I have
had money offered to me and turned it down. Not because I've thought I'm
not worth it but because something else has turned up that I would
rather do that didn't pay mega bucks.
''I don't need a lot. Having said that I live in this idyllic place
but a lot of people think 'Oh well have you got a farm? How many acres?'
I say: 'As far as the eye can see.' The fact that I don't own it is
something else.
''I like little rabbit hutches, secret gardens. I sat in that garden
yesterday after I had sort of watered and got drenched. I wish someone
would bring out a wetsuit so that people like me can water the garden.
I've never been able to water a garden without getting drenched. I sit
out there and if I sit very quietly I watch every bird and I can sit
there for hours.
''I can't do things in half measures. If I'm going to do it, I've got
to do it. Albert Finney did say to me: 'I'll say this to you Whitelaw,
you don't just take the money and run. You work.' ''
She has, of course. As a mother, a muse, and one of the entertainment
world's long-running magic makers.

Sceptical about career women lurching from bed to a networking
breakfast, JULIA LANGDON finds the idea a remarkable success
SOME people do it at the bus stop. Some do it in restaurants, or pubs,
or at the school gates. Just about everyone does it on the telephone.
And some women are so incredibly busy that they get up particularly
early in the morning and go out to breakfast in order to do it.
The subject is gossip -- or what we used to call gossip. Now that we
know better we call it networking. From across the Atlantic -- where
else? -- a new structure has been introduced to the humble exchange of
news, information, advice and help. It was the Americans who gave us
Ladies who Lunch and now they have exported to us Businesswomen who
Breakfast.
Networking sounds more respectable than gossiping and, of course, no
self-respecting businesswoman would have made it to Belgravia before 8am
for anything so vulgar as a gossip. But here we are, several dozen of
us, in the bar of a luxury hotel at a time of day when most women in
Britain are either at work, in bed, or doling out cornflakes -- and we
are all networking like mad at the tops of our voices.
On the day I attended there was an extraordinarily mixed group of
professional women present. Among others there were women from business
and the City, from public relations and girls' school -- among them a
senior Girl Guide, an image consultant, a barrister, a personal and
business development consultant -- whatever that is -- a massage
therapist, a local government official and a woman who helped companies
relocate their businesses. Significantly, almost without exception, they
referred to each other as ''ladies''.
''They are ladies who have made it,'' one of the organisers, Caroline
Salmon, explains: ''They have got somewhere and they want to meet people
who are like-minded souls -- that's what you find here. If they don't
like it, they don't stay.''
They sipped an orange juice, nibbled at croissants or a piece of fruit
-- although one sat down with a knife and fork and got stuck in to a
plateful of ham and cheese and fruit -- chipped in #10 each to a kitty
to raise money for research into ovarian cancer, and when the traffic
wardens came on duty most of them whizzed off to work.
We all gossip, most of us enjoy it and many of us find it extremely
useful. But is it really necessary to rise at dawn in order to go and
gossip with a group of like-minded women. Is it a reflection of
something missing in the reality of their daily lives? Are these perhaps
people without partners, or children?
Not so, says Sandra Hepburn, a former broadcasting executive with
Thames TV, who was one of the co-founders of this club, the Belgravia
Breakfast Club, six years ago. Sandra, a Scot, was born in Bearsden,
Glasgow. Those without partners, either through divorce or because they
have always been single, are very much in the minority among the
membership of just over 100; most also have children. It was the case,
however, that for obvious reasons the younger members with young
children were probably less regular attenders at the monthly meetings .
She started the group when a Canadian broadcaster who was in Britain
doing some research into management development had asked if there was
no ''multi-disciplinary'' women's group where she could meet a
cross-section of people. Sandra Hepburn had been an early member of
Women in Media, founded in the early 1970s, and knew of other groups for
women in industry or the City or business. There was also another group
which brought together a cross-section of high-fliers, but it was
expensive to join and what she called ''very shoulder-paddy''. She
recognised a need and thus the Belgravia Breakfasters came into being.
She talks about networking quite frankly and without any embarrassment
as a philosophy of life. ''I don't really think of it as networking'',
she says: ''It's the way I live''. She sees it as being partly about
feminist campaigning, and that from this there develop friendships and
support networks. It is the equivalent of a contacts' book, the little
black address book with the names and numbers of a wide range of people.
She is tirelessly energetic. I know because in the six months or so
since we first met she has ''belled'' me up from time to time on half a
dozen different subjects, all worthwhile and of mutual interest. She
conveys her interest and enthusiasms to others, too. ''It's the
knowing-somebody-who-does syndrome,'' she goes on, extolling the virtues
of networking. ''The person you want to talk to is only one phone call
away. It is an essential tool of survival''.
Networking is very much a two-way street. You receive help, but you
also expected to give it. ''The phrase has become somewhat cliched, but
if you call it a women's support group it sounds as if you are dealing
with battered wives. That is what it is, though, a support group.''
Her organisation deals with a great many high-powered well-connected
women. Don't those further down the employment ladder seem to manage to
get by without such a formal structure? She points out that many among
her membership run their own businesses or, for the very reason that
they are such high-fliers, are isolated at work and thus unable to
discuss their problems with others around them.
And women making their way in business and in professional areas which
may have been previously closed to them, do not have the same
established structures of all the Old Boy networks -- gentlemen's clubs,
or golf clubs, or even school and university. A networking organisation
does fill a need. Certainly those present when I attended were greatly
enthusiastic.
One of them was Nancy Wise, the broadcaster who now runs her own
presentation training business -- coaching people in speech-making or
how to handle the media. Like many others, she works mostly with men.
''I've nothing against them, they're a lovely lot,'' she says laughing.
''But it's absolutely terrific once a month to get together with
like-minded women who are all achieving. This group, they're all very
positive. You don't find youself talking to people who are down in the
mouth. They bring this very positive sort of energy and I think that is
quite invigorating.''

Bruce Sandison reports on a new plan to exploit the peat bogs of the
Flow Country
SCOTTISH raised peat bogs enjoyed a high profile in Edinburgh recently
at the International Peatland Convention. But as the experts opined,
work continued apace in Caithness, from where, for a decade, thousands
of tonnes of Flow Country blanket bog peat have been stripped and
shipped to fuel Swedish power stations.
Since the late 1980s, Highland Peat, the largest peat extraction
company in the UK, has supplied Flow Country peat to a Gothenburg power
station. In 1991, the company's then managing director, Innes Miller, of
Dale Farm, Westerdale, Caithness, and upon whose land the peat lies,
hoped for further business in Sweden: ''We are supplying only one
location, but there are 50 peat-burning power plants in operation in
Sweden and more are being built all the time.'' Miller is no longer
associated with Highland Peat or with Dale Farm, and he has disposed of
his interest in these companies.
Highland Regional Council (HRC), the planning authority, has
identified 9884 acres of Flow Country peat for commercial exploitation.
The HRC policy cornerstone is a barbecue charcoal factory. Barbecue
charcoal has, allegedly, a market value of #90m per year. The proposed
factory site is at Halsary, adjacent to present peat workings by the
Latheron/Thurso road, the principal tourist route into Caithness. The
factory will provide 16 long-term jobs.
David Richard-Jones, the HRC economic development officer, said: ''I'd
like to think this can get off the ground soon. It will provide a major
boost to the local peat industry which has previously been set back
through the power of the environmental brigade.''
The first application for charcoal processing at Halsary was made in
1991 by Dr George Weir, of Caithness Charcoal Ltd,
but the plan was abandoned because of funding problems. An attempt was
then made to process Flow Country peat in Wick by Islecroft Ltd, who
said their company would employ 50 people and send peat every week to
Arabia to mix with sand for making playing fields.
The research director of Islecroft Ltd was Dr Weir, of Caithness
Charcoal Ltd, and his associates included Duncan MacLeod, an ex-director
of the Bank of Scotland, and Alan Mackay, of Port Glasgow, who praised
the support Islecroft received from Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise.
Islecroft Ltd went into receivership in 1993.
Following the sale of Dale Farm Estate by John Clegg and Co, who
highlighted the fact that the estate held planning consent to extract
peat commercially while many similar planning applications were being
rejected, a new firm, Charcoal Process Ltd, announced proposals to
resuscitate the Halsary factory scheme.
Charcoal Process Ltd managing director is George Farlow. Farlow
designed the original, 1991, charcoal processing factory for Dr Weir's
company, Caithness Charcoal Ltd, and, subsequently, Farlow sustained
financial loss through his association with Islecroft Ltd.
HRC's Richard-Jones has been an eloquent advocate of charcoal
processing. In the 1990s Caithness Charcoal traded as Ayrshire Charcoal.
The company made a peat-processing application to Cumnock and Doon
Valley District Council in Ayrshire which was rejected. Richard-Jones
then invited them north -- when they changed their name to Caithness
Charcoal Ltd.
At the time of the 1991 Caithness Charcoal Ltd planning application,
greater claims were made about employment prospects: work for 80 people,
up to #700,000 a year for haulage contractors, cash for crofters who
supplied peat to the factory, and a benefit to the local economy of #40m
over 30 years.
Current job promises have been downgraded, but Charcoal Process Ltd
promises similar local employment and economic benefits. And, the
company claims, noxious gas emission will be strictly controlled. It
says that its development will have a minimal effect on the environment.
Local people are not reassured.
Scottish peatlands play an important part in locking away carbon
dioxide, the principal gas responsible for global warming. Peatland
plants accumulate carbon via photosynthesis, which is laid down in the
peat. It barely decays and, if left undisturbed, stores carbon for
thousands of years.
There is no evidence that commercial peat extraction has brought any
substantial benefit, either to local people, or to the Caithness
economy. What is evident, however, is a sterile wasteland, devoid of all
sign of life other than two tractors ploughing the black moor, and a
scrapyard of broken machinery by the banks of the Thurso River at
Westerdale.

ONE hundred years ago tomorrow, the Northern Rugby Union was formed in
The George Hotel, Huddersfield, after a breakaway from the English RU by
21 clubs who wanted to pay players for taking time off work to play.
It led to two rugby codes -- one openly professional and one arguably
amateur -- until now.
Rugby Football League chief executive Maurice Lindsay reacted to
decision by rugby union's International Board by saying: ''Both games
now will be judged on their athletic merits.
''Clearly, they have bitten the bullet and it will be interesting to
see now what their attitude is to us.
''At least this shamateurism of payments under the counter will
disappear and the regulations in their books, which effectively are in
there to keep us away from them, will have to be struck out.
''If they still insist on the ridiculous, hypocritical attitude
towards Rugby League, then it will prove that it is nothing more than a
snobbish, anti-social approach, because they can no longer hide behind
the amateur principles to keep us below stairs.
''It's amazingly ironic, almost as though it's got the hand of God in
there somewhere, that they have had a meeting to finally recognise the
principles that we approved of 100 years ago.
''Does that mean we are 100 years in front of them?
''I feel quite pleased for the people in our sport and for our
predecessors, who are no longer with us, who fought against the
hypocrisy over the century.''
On the prospect of there now being two professional rugby codes,
Lindsay added: ''We'll have to wait and see how they (Rugby Union)
manage their professionalism.''
Meanwhile, Australian rugby league chairman Ken Arthurson said he did
not expect any professional league players to switch codes as a result
of the IRFB decision.
''I don't hold any great fear of Rugby League players being poached,''
he said.
''Why would they want to switch, they can earn good money playing
Rugby League and traditionally league players have shown little interest
in Rugby Union. I think that's the way it will stay.''

The announcement was inevitable. If the IB had fudged the issue then
they would have lost all credibility
Ian McLauchlan
It puts the game on to a completely different sphere . . . it gives
the game a real chance to rival some of the true mass sports
Scott Hastings
THE news that rugby is at last to go professional, which I never
thought I'd see in my life, has been greeted with a mixture of
incredulity and understanding by those involved at the highest echelons
of the game in Scotland.
Ian McLauchlan, the players' agent, has a meeting set up for this
morning with six of the national squad, among them Rob Wainwright, to
plan ahead. He will also attend the SRU press conference at Murrayfield
later today.
''The announcement was inevitable. If the IB had fudged the issue then
they would have lost all credibility,'' McLauchlan said. ''I am pleased
that this has happened though.
''I am meeting the players to find out who their representative will
be, and it is apparent that the players will have to be involved in much
of what happens at every level from now on in Scottish rugby. Until I
find out the exact SRU position at their press conference there is not
much else I can say.''
Scott Hastings, the international centre, was similarly pleased at the
IB announcement. ''The players will now have to decide what they are
worth, and plan with the SRU the best way of maximising the income,'' he
said.
''It puts the game on to a completely different sphere, and now that
it's out in the open it gives the game a real chance to rival some of
the true mass sports like football and athletics.''
And, hinting that many players will see the change as just reward for
their efforts, Hastings looks forward to some remuneration. ''I think it
gives a player like me a chance to get some earnings at the tail end of
my career,'' he said.
''I may be able to take something out of the game now, after putting
so much in. Not that I ever played the game to start with for money.''
Vernon Pugh's statement that the only difference now between Rugby
Union and Rugby League was that union had 15 men and lineouts, whereas
league had 13 men and no lineouts, has put pressure on Rugby League as
never before.
The top league coach, New Zealander Graham West of Wigan, thinks that
the games should examine merging. ''I think that the situation is that
we could look at the two games closely now that union is professional.''
He added: ''There must be a hybrid form of the game that would be as
good as any game in the world. I think that it could happen at some
stage in the future.''
One immediate question that needs answered is how the money that will
be needed can be attracted into the game.
District rugby, supposedly the stepping stone to international
honours, has always struggled for benefactors, and yet is perceived as a
cut above the club game.
As an insight into district rugby, the fact that 80 players were asked
to a fitness test last Wednesday but only 30 turned up tells its own
story.
''Where is all of the money going to come from?'' asked the Glasgow
convenor, Hamish Fyfe. ''I just can't see how we can pay our players. We
would have to get further major sponsorship -- or else some help from
the SRU. I am a little stunned by the decision.''
Echoing the concerns of many about the immediate reward by cash
payment for winning in an overtly physical game, he expressed fears
about the dreaded win bonus.
''I have always worried about the win bonus,'' he said. ''I also
wonder whether there will actually be a place for someone like me now,
as this must inevitably call for professional administrators.''

As the game turns professional, Chief Rugby writer Derek Douglas in
Paris considers the changes.
THE symbolism is sublime or catastrophically ironic depending on the
point of view.
On August 29, 1895, in The George Hotel, Huddersfield, eleven clubs of
the Yorkshire Union broke away from the amateur game to form the Rugby
League. They were joined almost immediately by other clubs from
Lancashire and Cheshire and the great rift which has separated the two
codes of the rugby game was born.
The parting of the ways was over money. The North of England clubs,
which drew their players from the ranks of the working classes, wanted
to compensate their members for wages lost through playing rugby. They
called it broken-time money.
The South of England clubs -- bastions of the professional middle
classes, whose members were not suffering monetary disadvantage through
playing their sport, considered rugby to be a recreation which would
become tainted if its players were paid.
Yesterday in Paris, just two days short of the full century, Rugby
Union abandoned its impossible efforts to keep Mammon at bay and, as of
next month, following a meeting of the International Rugby Football
Board council in Tokyo, Rugby Union will become an open game and the
very mention of the word amateur will be exorcised from its regulations.
For three late summer days in Paris the 20-strong IB Council,
representing the 12 most powerful unions in the world, met to make a
decision of such tremendous impact that the game of rugby union will
never be the same again.
The former international referee Alan Hosie -- one of two
representatives from the Scottish Rugby Union (the other is Freddie
McLeod, who was a member of the IB's four-man working party on
amateurism) -- knew full well that he had been playing a part in
history.
''I never thought that I would live to see this day and neither did I
think that I would be part of it,'' he said.
McLeod and Hosie had come to the Paris meeting armed with a mandate
from the SRU that the hitherto unthinkable concept of professionalism
should be embraced.
As of next month, Scotland's rugby players can be paid. The
international stars -- the Logans, the Chalmers, and the Joiners -- will
be put under contract to the SRU and cash will be dispensed via a trust
fund.
Such a fund already exists, but yesterday's Paris announcement now
means that the sky is the limit and the full-time rugby professional is
a very distinct possibility.
However, the new ''open'' game also opens up the prospect of club
players and, even, schoolboys being paid or, in the case of the latter,
being sought out at an early age -- as in football -- by ambitious
clubs.
Whether the clubs in Scotland can afford to pay their players is
another matter entirely.
Despite the weekend decision in Paris, individual unions will still be
able to put in place domestic regulations which are more restrictive
than those drafted by the board.
Scotland's international players were initially led to expect some
#35,000 a year. Where the figure -- now revised to between #15-20,000 or
whatever the SRU can afford -- came from no-one now knows.
With All Blacks already in receipt of contracts worth more than
#100,000 a season, and England's internationalists promised #40,000 a
season through a new jersey sponsor, the capacity for player dissent
looms large.
The full committee of the Scottish Rugby Union was due to meet at
Murrayfield last night, McLeod and Hosie rushing straight from the
airport to brief their colleagues on events of the past three days in
Paris.
The SRU will stage a press conference today at which their position
will be made known to the Scottish rugby fraternity -- and not least the
players -- which waits in eager anticipation.
Although they denied it yesterday there is little doubt that the
international board were driven to the decision to end amateurism by the
events of quite seismic proportions which have rocked the game in the
past six months.
They have seen Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation sign an exclusive
#370m broadcasting deal with New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia,
and the Southern Hemisphere unions were now in a position to reward
their players handsomely.
Secondly, the board was fighting for its very survival in the face of
the planned coup by Kerry Packer's World Rugby Corporation. It sought to
sign up the world's top 1000 players to a professional game and then to
sell franchises to the existing unions.
Yesterday's announcement, in truth, was an indication that the board
was fighting for its life.
There is little doubt that the decision to embrace professional rugby
was not unanimous. Yesterday, IB amateurism working party chairman
Vernon Pugh, QC, of Wales, was asked that very question. ''That you will
never know,'' he replied, indicating that it was not.
Pugh was also asked whether clubs could afford to pay its players. ''I
would expect that the majority of first division clubs in most countries
will be able to pay something,'' he said. This statement flies in the
face of what most Scottish club are saying.
Pugh was also unable to determine how much players could expect to
earn.
To all intents and purposes Rugby Union is now a pay-for-play game
and, more, a game in which win bonuses are to become de rigueur.
The win bonus in particular, within the context of a physical contact
game, in which the capacity for violence simmers always just beneath the
surface, is sure to cause concern in many quarters.
Pugh said: ''We have debated this issue at length. We have looked at
the models elsewhere and Rugby League, for instance, is capable of being
extremely violent, but it seems to us that they have managed well enough
even when win bonuses are being paid.''
Another area of contention lies in the transfer of players from one
nation to another and from club to another. The board expects domestic
unions to regulate the club transfer market. Further regulations on
switching from one nation to another -- maybe from a lower paid nation
to one offering better terms -- are expected after next month's IB
council meeting in Tokyo.
Similarly, Rugby Union's position now vis-a-vis Rugby League will be
fleshed out at the Japanese summit.
The demeanour of Pugh, IB secretary Keith Rolands, and its chairman
Bernard Lapasset, at yesterday's momentous news conference indicated
that they had been dragged kicking and screaming to the altar of Mammon.
Pugh insisted that this was not the case. It was true, he said, that
he worried for the fundamental ethos of the new open Rugby Union, but
any sense of sadness was overtaken by the fact that a professional game
was, perhaps, inevitable.
He was right. Rugby Union could no longer maintain its credibility in
the face of widespread shamateurism charges. Nevertheless, William Webb
Ellis and many of those who have followed in his wake since that day at
Rugby School, in 1825 when the game is, by folklore, said to have been
born, will be birlin' in their graves, they will, though, birl in vain
because the decisions taken in the Hotel Ambassador in Paris these last
three days were inevitable and long overdue.

WHEN Lord Wakeham summoned up all the majesty of his position as
chairman of the Press Complaints Commission to ask the press kindly to
respect the privacy of Prince William at Eton College he must have
known, surely, that his efforts were likely to be met by one gigantic
rude raspberry. It has already been blown back in his face.
It was revealed yesterday that Sky Television is to show a film about
the life and expectations of the schoolboy Prince which will be shown to
mark his arrival at boarding school for the new school year. It may not
amount to much but Prince William and his parents will know, even if
Lord Wakeham does not, that there will be worse, much worse, to come.
Most newspaper editors in this country will have heard Lord Wakeham's
appeal and may respect it more or less, for a week or two, a month or so
-- or, alternatively, for however long it takes for the first marketable
photograph to be snatched. But that picture, whatever it is, whenever it
is taken, will not, in any case, have been the work of a staff
photographer employed by any newspapers answering to the Press
Complaints Commission or subject to the authority of an ex-Cabinet
Minister.
It will almost certainly have been produced by a freelance
photographer, who may quite possibly be foreign and will probably never
have heard of Lord Wakeham -- let alone the PCC -- and who may invest
weeks or months in seeking to secure just one shot that will sell around
the world and make it all worthwhile.
We are talking big business here. A man of my aquaintance told me this
week how he used to have on display a photograph of himself and a former
girlfriend meeting the Pope. The woman is known to the press and a
newspaper editor who visited his home saw the photograph and offered him
#30,000 for it. My friend was shocked and, outraged, said: ''How dare
you!'' The newspaper editor said: ''I'm so sorry. I do beg your pardon.
#60,000.'' That picture is now in the bank.
Do you think the press should be curbed? Do you feel that the
newspaper and magazine coverage of the royal family is offensively
intrusive? Do you believe that public figures, politicians, actors,
television stars, have a right to privacy?
You have probably answered ''Yes'' to all those questions, so here are
a few more. It is interesting, isn't it, to discover from the
peccadilloes of politicians that despite all their exhortations to
virtue, many of them are themselves little more than human? And you were
interested, weren't you, in Hugh Grant's search for relief in the course
of an acute attack of pancreatitis? And didn't you laugh when you saw
those photographs of Fergie getting her financial advice?
Here is one more question: are you a hypocrite? It is not an easy one
for any of us to answer. I do not have a great interest in the private
lives of famous stars of stage, screen, or Kensington Palace. But I
still look at the pictures in the newspapers and read with relish the
reports of juicier injudicious goings-on among the rich and famous.
Yet I also despair at some of the methods employed by a minority of my
colleagues which amount to a gross intrusion of personal privacy and I
have witnessed, with horror, the misery visited upon some people during
15 minutes of unsought fame, mesmerised by the attention they have often
unwittingly attracted and equally helpless in the headlines as rabbits
in the headlights.
I have added disgust to that despair since watching a video, on sale
in a shop near you, called Paparazzi. It is about the photographers who
make their living from snatching photographs of those whose photographs
can be marketed. Do not hasten, however, to purchase it on salacious
grounds for you will be sadly disappointed. It is, alas, nevertheless
''selling quite well'' according to its distributors.
It would be a mistake to call this ill-assorted selection of snippets
a film. It is a collection of shots of photographers photographing --
and most of those not filmed by an expert cameraman. It contains a great
deal of ''previously unseen video footage'' presumed to be of interest
to a voyeuristic public and designed to appeal to just such a public,
its appetite whetted by the rubbish printed daily in the cheaper
newspapers.
What is offensive about it is that it presents the paparazzi as
heroes, men (there were no women featured -- except as targets, of
course) who submit their lives to their search for the perfect picture,
who sacrifice their own private lives in order to intrude upon those of
others. And that this is made to seem in some way noble or worthy.
Here is a British photographer, a man called Jim Bennett, trying to
catch the royal family off guard hunting at Sandringham -- or
Sandring-ham as the commentary irritatingly describes it -- who is
apparently put to the inconvenience of leaving home at 6am daily and
driving 250 miles to Norfolk and back in the hope of a photograph which
might go around the world and help pay for his mortgage.
''My experience from the past is not to try to make any sort of
friendship with any of them,'' he says of the royal family, in what must
be a classic example of lese majeste. ''I found it interfered with
work.'' Here are men who wait for days up trees with their long-distance
lenses in the hope of a topless shot of Joan Collins, who pick through
Elizabeth Taylor's garbage before the rubbish trucks get there, who hire
helicopters to snoop on film stars from above -- all apparently in the
genuine belief that they are doing a job that needs to be done.
The reality is that they are meeting the needs of a market. They know
that if they capture the right photograph it will sell somewhere.
Nothing that Lord Wakeham could say will alter that. He might just as
well have saved his breath.

<TEXT>
FERRY passengers could be in danger from the maze of passageways being
created for money-spinning services, a marine safety watchdog claimed
yesterday.
The Sea Safety Group is worried that the increasing numbers of shops,
bars and amusement arcades on ferries could mean that, in the event of
fire, passengers would not find emergency exits.
Captain Tony Starling Lock, chairman of the group, which comprises
international ship-owners, pilots and captains, said: ''In maximising
facilities to boost profits, designers have created their own Hampton
Court maze for passengers.''
He also criticised the poor siting of emergency-exit signs, and
proposed improvements in line with the all-party Commons Transport
Committee report on cross-Channel ferries.
It recommended fitting transverse watertight compartment bulkheads on
car decks and introducing hotel-style star ratings for each ferry's
safety.
The group also recommended that: ship evacuation procedures and
equipment be upgraded; manning levels and hours of duty be changed to
''safe operating levels''; heavy vehicles be lashed on car-decks at all
times and crews given independent training in fire-fighting and
emergency procedures.
The group said that the Department of Transport had expressed concern
about the safety of roll-on roll-off ferries 30 years ago and the group
queried their use today.

A PAISLEY minister has attacked ''the cloak of silent secrecy''
surrounding the operation of the Church of Scotland's selection school
for applicants to the full-time ministry.
The Rev Thomas Cant claims there is now sufficient ''anecdotal
evidence'' to raise serious doubts about selection methods.
His criticisms come in a letter in the new issue of the Kirk's Life
and Work magazine, where he voices support for the men and women who
have offered their lives and services to the full-time ministry ''only
to be rejected by its selection school''.
Mr Cant, minister of Laigh Kirk, said that for many years he had been
involved as a parish minister with men and women who wanted to enter the
ministry in one way or another.
''To offer one's self to the Church for service is, in itself, a
deeply moving experience. When rejection and hindrances are placed in an
applicant's path, real pain and distress are added to the experience.''
Mr Cant criticised ''the cloak of silent secrecy'' which prevented the
applicant, his or her adviser, family, and minister from knowing why
they failed.
''The personal pain of rejection is compounded by the inability to
understand.''
Believing there is now sufficent anecdotal evidence to raise serious
doubts about the selection methods, he said: ''From my experience, I
would maintain that the wrong criteria are used in the wrong way in the
selection or rejection of potential candidates.''
He said committees of the Church of Scotland appeared in control
''while the voice of the people, the pew, and the parish is
disregarded''.
A spokeswoman for the Church of Scotland said the accusation about
secrecy was totally unfounded. ''There is no secrecy. It is an open
process which is constantly under review.''
Meanwhile, a Kirk committee and the editor of Life and Work, the
biggest selling religious monthly magazine in Britain, have clashed over
a move to increase its cover price.
Mr Robin Hill, editor of what is known as ''The Record of the Church
of Scotland'', is understood to be deeply concerned about the board of
communication's decision to raise its price from 60p to 70p at the start
of next year.
Five years ago, the cover price of the magazine -- which circulates
Kirk news and provides a forum for views within the Church -- was 30p,
with a readership of more than 100,000. In 1994-95 it cost 50p, and
circulation was 80,000. Presently, costing 60p, circulation is around
70,000.
The concern of Mr Hill, who took over the editorship a year ago, is
reflected in a small notice in the latest issue of the magazine which
indicates the price move to the readership.
It states: ''The board's decision -- taken without the support of the
magazine's staff -- was justified by rising production costs, caused by
a series of paper price increases in recent months.''
Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Kirk said the Board of Communication
had concluded that the price had to be increased, largely due to the
''soaring'' price of paper.
''It is fully aware of the staff's concern, but reluctantly decided
that the increase was necessary.'' It is thought staff fear a possible
further drop in the magazine's circulation as a result of another 10p
rise.
Mr Hill was not available for comment yesterday.

Bogota
POLICE officers and army troops combed a mountainous region southwest
of Colombia's capital today, trying to track down a British diplomat
believed kidnapped by leftist guerrillas two weeks ago, a senior police
official said.
However, he said the search operation was moving forward with
''extreme caution'' because of a strong rebel presence in the area and
hopes of avoiding a firefight in which the diplomat himself might be
killed.
''We want to get him safe and sound, without putting his life at
risk,'' the official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
He added there was no question that rebels were responsible for the
abduction of 32-year-old Timothy Cowley.
But authorities doubted that the kidnapping was politically motivated
and said the guerrillas were probably planning to exchange Cowley for a
hefty ransom to fill their war chest.
The staff sergeant and aide to the military attache at the British
Embassy in Bogota has been missing since he set out on a bird-watching
expedition in Colombia's rugged Tolima region more than 15 days ago.
Small search parties had been combing the area since British officials
informed Colombia's secret police of Cowley's disappearance two weeks
ago but the search was beefed up after a Colombian army officer revealed
the kidnapping on television on Friday night, the police official said.
Britain's Foreign Office said yesterday it was doing all it could to
secure Cowley's release but would not pay ransom.
Armed forces commander General Camilo Jose Zuniga has said there were
unconfirmed reports that Cowley's kidnappers were members of the Jaime
Bateman Canon Front, an offshoot of the M-19 guerrilla group active in
Colombia from 1974 until 1990.
But the police official said the kidnappers could also be members of
the much larger Revoutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which
specialises in kidnappings and providing protection for clandestine drug
operations.
There have been no public claims of responsibility for the kidnapping
and neither the British Embassy nor Colombian officials would comment on
any ransom demands.
Zuniga said Cowley had failed to take any security precautions when he
went on his trip.
''He was a functionary who, according to what I've been told, liked to
watch birds and went to the area without taking any security measures.''
He was abducted at a highway roadblock 100 miles west of Bogota, near
the village of El Toche, two weeks ago but his capture was kept quiet by
Foreign Office officials while negotiations were carried out with the
kidnappers.
''He may just have been in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' said a
British official. ''This is unfortunately a very common occurrence in
Colombia. He was unfortunate.''
Colombia has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world with an
average of four people abducted every day by guerrillas or ordinary
criminals. The kidnappers often make exorbitant ransom demands and
insist on cash payments even for the slightest tidbit of news about
their victims.
More than 700 people have been kidnapped in the country this year,
according to government figures.
Underscoring how commonplace the crime has become in Colombia,
Cowley's kidnapping was barely mentioned on its radio news programmes
today and ignored by most leading newspapers.
Cowley is the third Briton to have been abducted this year in
Colombia.
In the previous two kidnappings -- including a January incident
disclosed by a military intelligence source yesterday -- one Briton
killed some of his captors and escaped and one was killed by his
kidnappers, officials said.
They said the kidnappers had made contact with the British Embassy in
Bogota but it was not known if any ransom demands had been made.
A Foreign Office spokesman in London confirmed that negotiations have
been taking place with Cowley's captors but was unable to provide

''We are doing all we can to secure his return but our position with
ransoms is well-known -- we don't pay them,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said Cowley had been working
as a clerk at the embassy, assisting the defence attache with
administrative and personnel duties.
He held the rank of staff sergeant in the General Adjutant's Corps,
which is responsible for much of the clerical work within the British
Army.
Earlier this month, officials discovered the body of another Briton,
Trevor Catton, who was kidnapped two months ago.
Catton, 22, who had been living in Colombia with his family for years,
appeared to have been shot dead by his unidentified captors.
His family had been in the process of selling their home, a car and
motorcycle to scrape together his ransom when they learned of his death.
Another British citizen kidnapped in Colombia in January killed some
of his captors and escaped, according to a Colombian military
intelligence source.
The man, whose kidnapping was not made public, was abducted by
National Liberation Army guerrillas in the country's eastern region of
Casanare.
He was reportedly held about five days until he managed to escape,
killing several of his captors in the process.
The source said the man, whom he could not identify, worked as a
security adviser to a British company in Colombia.--PA/Reuter.

ONE of the oddest phenomena of Scottish politics to an observer based
at Westminster is the suspicion or fear that sweeps interested members
of the electorate from time to time that Labour will not really set up a
Scottish parliament if they win the next election.
When I was in Scotland some months before the last election I was
surprised by the number of people of varying views who asked me if I
thought Neil Kinnock would actually go ahead with it.
I replied that the commitment would be in the manifesto, that Kinnock
had publicly promised the legislation would be introduced in the first
session of the new parliament and that, based on talking about
devolution, with leading Labour figures for years, I had absolutely no
doubt that the Bill would be forthcoming. This assurance was often met
with a less-than-satisfied grunt or ''Oh well that's all right then''
which sounded more like someone unwilling to prolong the discussion than
someone really convinced.
In a way I could understand it. Kinnock had campaigned against
devolution in 1979 and was still reckoned not to be over the moon about
it. Also, if you counted the referendum as well as three General
Elections Labour had failed four times to deliver a devolved assembly
though they could certainly say they had tried. Now, of course, they
have failed at another election and had a leader closely involved in
devolution politics succeeded by one who, again, is thought to acquiesce
in the policy rather than being a real fan.
None the less the commitment to a Scottish parliament will be in the
next manifesto. Mr Blair has already promised to legislate in the first
session of the new parliament and I continue to have absolutely no doubt
that if Labour win, which looks likely, the legislation will be
forthcoming. The doubts seem to spring rather from the ''England will do
us down'' attitude that has been a fairly constant factor on the
Scottish political scene over the past two or three decades. It is, and
I speak as a Scot, an unattractive attitude.
If it is true, which I personally don't believe, that the English or
the Westminster system is doing Scotland down then, as Mr Salmond
constantly reminds us, the Scots can do something about it. Elect 72 or
even a majority of independence candidates and we are on the road to
controlling our own affairs or as much as it is possible to do in an
increasingly interdependent world.
It is not much use devolutionists complaining that Scotland has voted
for devolution in four elections and been denied it by a non-Scottish
anti-devolution majority and Westminster. If you are a devolutionist
rather than a separatist you have to accept that within the Union you
support such things can happen.
Although the size of the Edinburgh parliament and whether it can be
dissolved unilaterally by Westminster as was Stormont will provoke many
more fierce debates, the tax question may well loom larger in the mind
of the average voter.
The devolvers have to accept that even if all the assigned taxes
raised in Scotland -- VAT and income -- go to Edinburgh the parliament
will still need a ''top up'' from Westminster which will, of course,
have already fixed the income and VAT rates.
If they go for a block grant similar to the present one they will
require strong arguments that Scotland does actually deserve what it
gets over the UK per capita figure. If they go for an agreed percentage
of the UK tax take they have to bear in mind that formulas can be
revised. In other words it seems to be built into a devolved system that
if the devolved area wants more spent on it than it raises in taxes it
will remain dependent on the central parliament.
Labour are clinging to the Scottish parliament having tax-raising or
cutting powers to give it political teeth. But there is more than a
suspicion that these may turn out to be false teeth. It is very hard to
imagine Westminster being so prodigal with its grant that the Edinburgh
government can say ''Oh, we don't need all this cash actually. We'll use
it to cut income tax.'' It is not quite so hard, but still hard, to see
a Labour-dominated executive saying ''Scots feel differently about
public services, they won't mind paying 1p more for better ones''.
Variants are possible. Westminster could levy a tax on all four parts
of the UK to cover foreign representation, EU dues, defence, and social
security and then levy additional taxes for everything else in England,
Wales, and Northern Ireland leaving the Scottish executive to decide how
much it wanted to raise for these. That would give the Edinburgh
parliament greater autonomy but the political risk of taxing more or
providing less than the UK level would remain. As Labour step back from
moving to a federal UK system the Edinburgh parliament may look even
more like a halfway house.
That is not necessarily a criticism. One of the fears that has haunted
Scottish Labour MPs for nearly three decades is that failure to deliver
on a Scottish assembly would make them hideously vulnerable to the
nationalists.
All one can say is that after each of five electoral failures to
deliver the nationalists have won either two or three seats at the
following election and have never done better than 21.5% of the total
poll. Yet, even if apparently contradicted by the facts, the fear
remains potent and may, despite the genuine attachment of many Labour
Party members to the devolution idea, be the main reason why, if Labour
win next time, there will be a Scottish parliament.

A MINISTER from Jamaica began a two-year stint as a missionary in two
Scottish parishes yesterday.
The Rev Norbert Stephens, 31, of the United Church of Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands, will work as an associate minister and divide his time
between the Glasgow suburb of Bearsden and Clydebank's Faifley housing
scheme.
Mr Stephens, from the Jamaican mining town of Spalding, was invited to
Scotland by the Church of Scotland, which said there was a need for
''missionaries in reverse''.
The Rev Dr John Munro, of the Kirk's Board of World Mission, said the
Church needed the vision of its overseas partners if it was to thrive.
Yesterday, in Bearsden South Parish Church, Mr Stephens said he hoped
to share his experience of religion and worship with the congregations
and communities of Bearsden and Faifley.
He admitted he found the Glasgow climate rather cold, but said he and
his wife, Josephine, and their two young daughters were settling in
well. The family arrived in Glasgow a week ago.
After visiting both parish churches Mr Stephens said the services were
very different from those in Jamaica. ''I found the Scots very open
people. We've been warmly welcomed and I don't feel there's any
opposition to us being here.''

COUNCIL-TAX levels in South Ayrshire will soar if the Scottish Office
does not increase funding and Glasgow is allowed to drain money from
other councils, the leader of the new authority warned yesterday.
Councillor Ian Welsh described the situation as ''very serious
indeed'' and called for pressure to be brought to bear on Secretary of
State for Scotland Michael Forsyth for an acceptable solution.
He disclosed that the new South Ayrshire Council faces a deficit of
more than #777,000, which is the difference between Scottish Office
assessments for the first year of the authority and what is currently
spent by Kyle and Carrick District Council and Strathclyde Regional
Council in the area.
This deficit alone would lead to an increase of over #19 a year for
Band D council-tax payers with similar percentage increases in all other
bands.
Councillor Welsh, along with leaders in other councils in Strathclyde,
is also worried that the #79m deficit which Glasgow City Council faces
may end up being shared among them.
This, he estimates, would add #99 to the average council tax for no
new services, no provision for funding pay awards or even contingency
funding to cope with new legislation.
He said: ''This is a very serious situation indeed and we are most
concerned. We are calling on the Government to take action quickly as it
is grossly unfair for people in South Ayrshire to be penalised as a
direct result of local government reorganisation.
''If nothing is done we will end up paying much more for the same, or
perhaps fewer, services than we have now.''
Councillor Welsh added: ''We need to alert all council-tax payers to
the problem and put pressure on the Scottish Office to find sufficient
funding to allow a seamless transition between the old and the new
councils -- something which we in South Ayrshire are trying very hard to
do.''
Deputy council leader John Baillie said: ''This situation exposes the
myth that reorganisation would save council-tax payers money.
''Before the new council has even begun to operate, the Scottish
Office is trying to saddle us with an enormous financial burden.''
The case is to be taken up by Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick,
Cumnock and Doon Valley, who will urge Mr Forsyth to look again at the
funding levels not only for the Ayrshire councils but for all of the new
authorities.
Mr Foulkes said: ''The Government set up these new single-tier
authorities despite little local support so it should now be prepared to
fund them. It appears from these figures and from others emerging
elsewhere that far from saving money as was promised the new councils
are going to cost the people they serve an enormous amount more.
''Michael Forsyth must be prepared to think again and allow proper
funding for all councils so that neither Glasgow nor South Ayrshire nor
any council will have to cut services or put round the begging bowl . .
.''
Mr Foulkes added: ''What I find even more despicable is the fact that
Michael Forsyth may be using this as part of a grand pre-election
strategy to force councils to raise taxation levels and then put the
blame on them.''
Mr Phil Gallie, Conservative MP for Ayr, said: ''I am meeting
officials of the new South Ayrshire authority this week and I am sure if
there are concerns these will be expressed to me then.
''I will be looking very closely at the figures to see if there is a
genuine problem or if we are just hearing the traditional Labour
councils bleating about money.
''The people of South Ayrshire have been subsidising Glasgow for years
through Strathclyde and I am now hoping that the new set-up will bring
them genuine benefits.''

Salem, Montserrat
THE threat from a tropical storm ebbed today but the Caribbean island
of Montserrat remained in a state of high alert as its rumbling volcano
showed increased activity.
Tropical Storm Iris sent threatening clouds over the tiny island,
where thousands of people were crammed into public shelters and
overcrowded homes waiting for a possible eruption.
Authorities had torn down a tent city and moved evacuees into shelters
on Friday when it appeared a much stronger Iris would pass close to the
British colony in the Lesser Antilles.
At least 20 small earthquakes rattled the area around the Chances Peak
volcano on Friday and early yesterday, heightening concern for residents
who needed to return to the evacuated danger zone in the south of the
island to tend to livestock, pets and homes, said Governor Frank Savage.
''We have to tell them the risk they are running. We can't protect
them while they're there,'' Savage told Reuters.
Formerly a hurricane, Iris had faded, but the threatening weather
brought more discomfort to Montserrat residents, who have been out of
their homes for four days after an evacuation of the southern half of
the island.
Authorities issued the evacuation order for more than half of the
island's 11,000 residents and closed the capital on Wednesday when
scientists said there was a good chance the volcano, which rumbled to
life on July 18, would erupt.
After painstaking reconstruction of its homes, economy and image after
the devastation of Hurricane Hugo, the island was just hitting its
stride.
Tourism was rising, the tiny manufacturing sector was booming, real
estate was buoyant and shops were doing well.

A BORDERS man, who rushed to the aid of victims of a road accident,
collapsed and died at the scene as he tried to free them from the
wreckage, it emerged yesterday.
Good Samaritan James Riddell reached the accident spot to find that
two brothers had been fatally injured when their car had overturned.
It is believed the trauma of the men's injuries was too much for the
54 year old, who had a heart condition.
Mr Riddell, of Abbots Row, Coldingham, Berwickshire, who had been
first to arrive at the scene, fell to the ground with a suspected heart
attack and died at the side of the road.
The two men who died in the accident, at around 8pm on Saturday
evening, were named as 55-year-old hotel owner Charles Campbell, of the
Gordon Arms Hotel, Gordon, and his brother Robert, 45, of Briery Baulk,
Duns.
The vehicle, a Hyundai Pony owned by the elder brother, left the road
and overturned on the A6105 Duns to Greenlaw road three miles west of
Duns.
A third occupant of the car Mr Terence Porter, 27, of Glebe Park,
Gordon, was seriously injured and taken to Borders General Hospital.
Last night Mr Riddell's wife Moyra, 48, spoke of how her rugby-loving
husband, who had been driving home from a rugby sevens tournament at
Selkirk, would always put the needs of others before his own health.
''He was always first to volunteer to help someone if he thought he
could,'' said Mrs Riddell, who runs a caravan site at Coldingham.
''There was no way he would have driven past those men in the crashed
car.''
The couple were due to celebrate their 27th wedding anniversary later
this week. Their 24-year-old son Alec was yesterday travelling from his
home in Aberdeen.
The Gordon Arms Hotel was closed yesterday as a mark of respect.
Meanwhile, a 21-year-old Scottish nanny was killed and the triplets
she was looking after were injured when the car in which they were
travelling overturned.
Nichola Moon, from Langside, Glasgow, had been looking after the
12-month-old girls of the Veazey family from London since June this
year.
They were returning from a holiday in the West Country when their
Toyota Spacecruiser collided with a Montego on the A303 near Andover,
Hampshire. Both cars overturned down an embankment and Miss Moon was
certified dead at the scene.
The driver of the Toyota, Mrs Janis Veazey, 39, and her husband
William, 37, sustained minor injuries.
Their daughter Celeste suffered a broken leg but her sisters Paris and
Morgan only received minor cuts and bruising.
Miss Moon spent her early years on Arran and was educated in the
Langside area of Glasgow. She recently completed training as a nursery
nurse and this was her first job.

MEN IN BLACK
By John Harvey
Reaktion Books: #19.99
THIS gloriously earnest tome is about clothes. Men's clothes, and
black clothing in particular. Black is not a colour at all; it is a
no-colour, a negation of light, the colour of night and sin, penitence
and death. But, in our modern era, it has become the colour of power.
From Victorian times, men seeking authority, men declaring themselves to
belong to some ruling class -- be they bankers, lawyers, Presbyterian
ministers, Nazi storm troopers, Jools Holland, or Hastings Banda --
have, more and more, arrayed themselves in solid, monolithic black.
John Harvey is a lecturer in English at the University of Cambridge.
What might seem, at first sight, a bizarre essay in fetishism proves a
most worthy, frightfully clever essay in clothing, culture, and
psychology. It is very hard reading -- ''. . . the ambiguities, puns,
and equivocations of dress are so subtle and multiple that a science of
them would need to be not so much a clear coded semiotics as a science
of inferred contradictory implication,'' laughs our author -- and, at
times, has all the character of an earnest Open University broadcast
glimpsed, by accident, on Saturday morning.
Light reading it aint. But successive chapters, drawing heavily on
fiction and art through the ages, put some life into the theme.
From Hamlet to Dickens, via the Spanish Inquisition, through the
Impressionists to the Blackshirts, the Gestapo and Be-Binbagged punk
rockers, Harvey drools over black, investing it ever more solemnly with
complex codes of meaning. There's lots of pictures in the book. Good
pictures too.
There's also a great deal of quotation, and much selection from choice
English writing. Indeed, Harvey's analysis of, say, Hamlet, or The
Mystery of Edwin Drood, are much more accessible and worthwhile than
some of his sillier thoughts about black. I'm sorry he doesn't address
Hogg's Memoir and Confessions Of a Justified Sinner: Robert Wringhim and
Gil-martin, I am sure, would reduce Harvey to quivering ecstasy, and
stop him saying quite so many daft things about Calvinism.
He also ignores Mary, Queen of Scots, one of the most celebrated
black-clad icons. I don't think Harvey likes Scotland much.
But he does give us Bela Lugosi, cinema's definitive Count Dracula;
the All Blacks make an appearance, of course, and Marlon Brando
(complete with still from The Wild One, 1953), and Sir Oswald Mosley . .
. so it's not all Vermeer, Cezanne, and the great Gothic novel. There
is, somewhere in the profundity of the text, Harvey's distant chuckle;
the humour of a honed academic mind trawling through culture ancient and
modern, opining at every point, analysing, but never quite losing sight
of his own dance with absurdity.
In our age black has shifted curiously in the generations. It's young
folk, by and large, whom one now sees in that most dramatic shade.
Politicians have abandoned morning suits for various shades of sad blue.
Advocates wear their blacks as little as possible. Most striking in my
own culture is the dramatic decline in clerical dress. When I was a
child, almost all Free Church ministers wore dog collars, black suits,
and Anthony Eden hats; on Sabbath, they preached in frockcoats. Today,
only a minority ever wear the Roman collar; a mere handful still cling
to black suits or jackets, and I'm not sure if there's a frockcoat left
in captivity.
In fact, the issue has been politicised. The majority party in the
Free Church today positively recoils from traditional black clerical
dress; the image is now associated with the unpopular and aggressive
right wing. This is rather a pity.
The monochrome look is the most effective preaching attire; white
collar and cuffs emphasise the orator's most important extremities, and
the look is self denying, stressing the role over the individual. There
are now some lamentably dressed padres about, given to porridge-coloured
suits, swede shoes, and sad anoraks.
Reaction is setting in, especially among the Young Turks of the Free
Church right, and the late General Assembly saw some of these intense
lads in attendance, latter-day Wringhims of chilling mien and exuding
the kind of virtue that is its own punishment. It is the young, after
all, who most burn with idealism, who most crave identity in and
conformity to a power-class and a higher cause. It was the young, not
the old, who followed Hitler.
The Free Presbyterians -- following a spectacular row at their 1976
Syndod -- still adhere uniformly to clerical garb, by order of canon
law. Only in the option of the traditional white bow-tie or the round
dog-collar does their young minister retain room for individuality. By
seizing on the key points -- uniformity, humility in self, pride in
group -- of black, they have negated any internal political notes, and
-- since the Lord Mackay affair split the church and took away the sort
of ministers who wore light blue stocks -- the Free Presbyterians
symbolise unity in monochrome.
Men In Black is one of Reaktion Book's ''Picturing History'' series,
billed as a ''New kind of historical writing in which images form an
integral part . . . as active tools of negotiation, parody, and
resistance -- as basis in which history is made and enacted, as well as
recorded.'' How nineties.
''One may say that if there is a dominant meaning in the widespread
use of black,'' concludes Harvey, ''that meaning is associated at once
with intensity and with effacement; with importance, and with the
putting on of impersonality. Alone or in ranks, the man in black is the
agent of a serious power; and of a power claimed over woman and the
feminine . . . the fashion derived from the use of black in churches,
where it was associated with a kind of spiritual grieving: with a
spirituality that place humanity in an infinite abandonment and depth of
need.''

Copenhagen
TWELVE Danish convicts escaped from a Copenhagen prison today after an
accomplice drove a bulldozer through the perimeter wall in a mass
jailbreak filmed on national television.
The prisoners, some of them convicted murderers, were enjoying a grill
party with visiting family members in the yard of Vridsloeselille state
jail when the bulldozer smashed a four-metre wide opening in the wall at
around 5pm.
A television crew from a local station, TV-Stop, who said they had
been tipped off about some kind of action at the prison, were in place
to shoot the entire event.
Footage shown on Danish national television showed the bulldozer
smashing into the wall and the driver jumping out and running away from
the jail followed by a dozen convicts, some of them shouting ''Yes'' in
triumph.
Only two prison guards were in the yard at the time of the escape,
police said.
Two of the 12 fugitives were arrested within a few hours. Police,
continuing a search for the other 10 and for the accomplice, said
several getaway cars may have been waiting outside the jail.
Criminal inspector Villy Eliassen told national television that most
of the fugitives had been serving long sentences, some for murder, some
for armed robbery and others for narcotics crimes.
Eliassen said members of the television crew were being questioned
about what exactly they knew when they set up their camera outside the
prison.
He said they might face charges for failing to inform the police about
the tip-off.
The escape took place as police were busy keeping order at a nearby
premier league game between Copenhagen's top soccer teams -- Broendby
and FC Copenhagen.
''It was very well timed. The people who planned this may have known
we were tied up elsewhere,'' Joern Bro, police chief in the south
Copenhagen suburb of Glostrup, said on television.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH bird expert has been enlisted to help the Faroe Islands
save their puffins from invading rats. Almost half of the islands'
puffin population has been wiped out by the egg-eating rodents.
After flying north to survey the situation, ornithologist Bernie
Zonfrillo said: ''They've certainly got big problems. The rats are on
just about all the islands and the puffin nests are beginning to
disappear.
''The rats were never meant to be on these islands and some of the
people are now becoming very conscious that their puffins are going to
disappear completely unless they do something about it.''
Mr Zonfrillo has already rid Ailsa Craig of rats in the first such
project ever undertaken in the northern hemisphere, and the puffins are
now circling the island deciding whether to nest there again after more
than 70 years.
But he admitted the Faroe Islands will present a much bigger
challenge.
''It's going to take a lot of manpower and a lot of money -- thousands
of pounds certainly, probably hundreds of thousands. It's going to be a
long-term project to eradicate each island in turn,'' he said.
The rats on Ailsa Craig, which took over the island in 1886 after a
coal boat sank off its shore, were exterminated four years ago using
warfarin, a humane poison. It had taken them around 35 years to rob the
sanctuary of all its puffins.
Mr Zonfrillo is from Glasgow but spends almost half the year living
and working alone on Ailsa Craig.

GREAT advert, shame about the product -- most of us at some time have
thought that about a TV commercial that took our breath away, had us in
stitches, or revived one of our favourite rock'n'roll tunes.
Powerful drama, rather than comedy or music, was the mode for the
latest ad that had everything going for it -- nine out of 10 people
surveyed remembered seeing it -- apart from the fact that it didn't
work.
The scene -- an ostensibly happy couple with their friends in the pub.
He is buying a round, she is looking subdued. We see why when the ad
flashes back to the state of her face the last time it collided with his
fist.
Now the Scottish Office, who commissioned the ad, have been reminded
that ''When are you going to stop beating your wife?'' is a metaphor for
the type of annoying question people don't like being asked, because
they can't win no matter how they answer it.
The idea that it might just make some men mad, instead of ashamed,
obviously hadn't occurred to them. Victims of domestic violence who
phoned for help were put through to an answering machine.
Particularly chilling was the discovery that some women lived in dread
of the advert coming on while they were sitting watching TV with their
violent partners.
It is almost as if it were putting ideas into their men's heads. Men
are luckier -- for them this frisson of fear is more likely to be
brought on by advertisements for house-paint.
How, then, to curb their less-decorous instincts? The Zero Tolerance
Campaign is one approach, and not one to which I immediately warmed.
My first encounter was a row of posters along Princes Street in
Edinburgh proclaiming ''Male abuse of power is a crime''.
There are two flaws in this argument. 1. Abuse of power isn't
necessarily a crime -- that's why people get away with it.
2. They aren't all male. Most, maybe, since males have more power, but
13 years of Thatcherism should have disabused us of the notion that we
have a monopoly on it.
Pedantic? Perhaps so, but I abhor violence against women or anyone
else. If people like me are put off by Zero Tolerance, what chance does
it have of getting through to the thugs? Clearly something different is
required.
Some advertisements which borrow their motif from the cinema are
particularly effective.
The scene from The Godfather in which a brutish husband is garrotted
by one of his father-in-law's henchmen seems par ticularly apposite.
Perhaps the current mix of real life and soap opera, involving the
release from prison of wives who have slain their husbands, will succeed
where advertising has failed.
Public service advertisements are not the only ones to suffer from
this gap between production excellence and moving the product.
Take Rowan Atkinson. He is in various adverts, and I love them all,
but off the top of my head I couldn't tell you what they are for. Smith
and Jones, Fry and Laurie . . . I lap them up. But what was the name of
that building society? As for John Gordon Sinclair, it would be easier
to list the ads that don't use his voice.
Sometimes the gap extends beyond mere apathy towards the product. The
series of ads for Coors beer (''Lift up the Coors, John'') is one of my
favourites, but the only time I lifted a Coors I couldn't put it down
again quickly enough.
None of these pitfalls appears to have discouraged the world's richest
man, Bill Gates, from splashing out millions of pounds on the launch of
his latest computer software, Windows 95, a package which seems to add a
few bells and whistles to the stuff Mr Gates has been using for years to
take over the world of computing.
If you have managed to get this far without having heard or read about
Windows 95, I congratulate you, even though you probably think ethnic
cleansing is something that happens in a Chinese laundry.
The consensus among serious computer users seems to be that the hype
comfortably exceeds the significance of the product.
It was ever thus. Can you remember the hype back at the start about
what an indispensable educational tool a computer was for your children,
no home should be without one, and so on.
The early ones lived up to that. The Acorn commissioned by the BBC
could be plugged in, started up, and used as it was. It had a built-in
programme which allowed free rein for programming creativity. The
manual, though thick, was a model of clarity.
Once we were softened up, the picture changed.
The BBC was crowded out by home computers which had become a vehicle
for selling more and more games software, requiring more and more memory
to be added on to the hardware. When you thought Junior was upstairs
learning how to become the new Bill Gates he was probably taking part
vicariously in a grotesque, grunting Kung Fu fight.
If it is an education, let us hope it isn't for married life.

Kinshasa
ZAIRE could begin throwing out Rwandan refugees again this week after
its talks in Kinshasa with the UN refugee agency UNHCR broke up today
without accord on the future of a million homeless.
Officials said the talks will continue in Geneva, where the UNHCR
announced today its chief, Sadako Ogata, would meet Zaire Prime Minister
Kengo wa Dondo on Tuesday
''There could not be agreement here because the UNHCR wanted to
consult at a higher level,'' an official source at the talks told
Reuters.
''Expulsions could begin again this week if no agreement is found, and
at this stage the signs are not good,'' said another government source
before the talks broke down.
Zaire began to expel Rwandan and Burundian refugees from camps in the
east of the country on August 19. An international outcry resulted, with
protests from the United Nations Security Council and many Western
countries calling for the forced repatriations to stop on humanitarian
grounds.
More than a million refugees fled civil wars in their own countries to
Zaire, where they are accused of destroying the local environment and
economy and of introducing massive insecurity.
Special envoy Carrol Faubert, on a mission for the UN High Comissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), has been meeting Zaire officials for four days
trying to agree a formula to turn the forced expulsions into voluntary
repatriations.
Faubert and Zaire's Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda were leaving
for Geneva today, officials said. Kengo's adviser on refugees, Mutiri wa
Bishara, was travelling with them.
Since Zaire suspended the use of force to drive the refugees back to
Rwanda, very few have taken up the offer of the UNHCR to take them under
its wing. The voluntary repatriation plan came to a virtual halt
yesterday, when only 47 refugees crossed into Rwanda.
The Rwandans are mostly from the Hutu majority and fled after the
victory in July 1994 of rebels dominated by the Tutsi minority. Many
feared reprisals for a campaign of genocide in which up to one million
Tutsis were killed by Hutu soldiers and militias.
Public opinion in Kinshasa, while not always influential on government
policy, is for once in agreement with Kengo on the expulsions.
Kengo himself has now left Kinshasa on holiday from where he will head
for his talks with Ogata on Tuesday. Ogata's spokesman said the meeting
might be at the UNHCR offices or elsewhere.
''Some details may be changed, but Tuesday in Geneva is firmly planned
now, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said.
Meanwhile, refugees at one of the transit camps for Rwandans expelled
by Zaire said today they were happy to be home and their reception
dispelled fears of revenge for last year's genocide.
''I am very happy, but I am also very weary. Happy that I am going
home, tired that it is a long time since I left and I don't know what
changed,'' Apolinari Mugambira, a peasant, told Reuters at the Nyagatare
transit camp, near Cyangugu.
UN military observer Captain Victor Inakah said at Nyagatare no
security problems or cases of Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) soldiers
detaining returnees had been reported since the expulsions.
But further north at Nkamira transit camp 36 men among 200 refugees
who left Zaire voluntarily on Friday were detained by the RPF soldiers
and questioned about whether they were involved in the genocide.
The fate of the 36 was unknown but their detention seemed bound not to
encourage refugees to join a voluntary repatriation which the United
Nations is offering in place of the forced expulsions.--Reuter.

THE husband and family of a woman who has lain in a coma for more than
three years are to meet in a hospital today to discuss a legal attempt
to remove a feeding tube and allow her to die.
Yesterday Mr Peter Johnston, 53, from Allanton, near Shotts, said he
wanted his wife Janet, 50, to be allowed to die in peace and with
dignity. If the case reaches the Court of Session in Edinburgh it will
be Scotland's first so-called ''right to die'' case.
Mr Johnston, a retired butcher, said his wife slipped into a coma
three and half years ago after contracting a virus. He said doctors had
given up any hope of her making a recovery.
''I just want to let her go. If it was left to me I would pull the
tube out myself but you can't do things like that nowadays.''
Last year the Government refused to lift a ban on euthanasia and it is
expected that the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, will contest
the action to be brought by Law Hospital, Carluke. But Mr Johnston said
his daughter Linda, 30, and his wife's two brothers supported the move.
Acknowledging there had been some hostility in the small village of
Allanton over his wish to allow his wife to die, Mr Johnston said as far
as he was concerned his wife died three and a half years ago and that
she would have wanted to to die.
''Locally people hate me for wanting to do this. Janet was well liked
in our village. That's the trouble, she was too liked. They don't want
to see her die. I can understand that but they have no idea what it's
been like, seeing her just lying there in a bed month after month, year
after year.''
Yesterday a spokeswoman for Law Hospital, Carluke, said until the
matter went to court the hospital did not want to make any comment. She
confirmed that Mrs Johnston's vegetative condition had not changed
Commenting on the move, the Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Church
of Scotland's Board of Social Responsibility, said that each case had to
be assessed on its own merits and that it was a matter that should be
decided between doctors and the family.
''There is no moral obligation to keep a person alive but each case is
different. If there's a reasonable possibilty of a person making a
recovery then that is different. There are a lot of technical
considerations but we see no value in insisting that a person be kept
alive by artificial means.''
The Roman Catholic Church's Father Tom Connelly said the Church
neither acted as a legislator or a medical expert but it was clear about
the sanctity of life and that it was wrong to speed up someone's death.
''The Church's position is that while you are not obligated to take
extraordinary moves to keep a person alive you should not kill a person
but it is not our business to advise the law lords or the people, we can
simply outline the moral position.''
The move comes a month after the first highly-publicised right-to-die
case in the Irish Republic. In that case the Irish Supreme Court ruled
that the woman, who had lain in a coma for 23 years, should finally be
allowed to die.

THOSE ceremonies which rounded off half a century since the end of the
Second World War reminded me of a question I'm often asked: Of all the
people you have interviewed, does any one stands out in your memory
above all?
You can rake over formidable characters like Paul Getty, Robert
Boothby, Margaret Thatcher, Ian Paisley, Mohammed Ali or film stars like
Charlie Chaplin, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor.
But when you put them into the perspective of powerful personality and
intriguing life-story, the name which shoots to the top will be unknown
to most.
Yet the considerable anonymity which surrounded Dr Ernst Hanfstaengl
was in contrast to the enormity of the role he played in history, taking
us back to that ghastly war and the monster who started it.
Adolf Hitler would no doubt have emerged in time as the fiend he was.
But how much easier the route when he crossed the path of the large,
genial semi-aristocrat known as Putzi Hanfstaengl, respected historian,
magnificent pianist, and charismatic figure of Munich society.
I caught up with Hanfstaengl in the post-war privacy of that same
Munich villa where, without enough thought for what he was doing, he
played host to the gangsters who were planning to rule the world.
The scene was unchanged: That was Hitler's chair, he said. Eva Braun
sat here; Goering, Goebbels, Hess over there. In this cluttered study,
the grand piano was still in the corner and there were pictures to show
the whole gang around Hanfstaengl at the keyboard.
So how did it all happen? Putzi Hanfstaengl was born in 1887 of a
German father and American mother and sent to Harvard, where he
befriended Franklin D Roosevelt. The Hanfstaengls were well-known in the
art reproduction world, with shops in Munich and New York.
After college, Putzi stayed on to run the family business on Fifth
Avenue, gaining friends like William Randolph Hearst, T S Eliot, and
Walter Lippmann. Returning to Munich in 1921, he was asked by the
American Embassy in Berlin to check out a would-be politician who was
due to speak in a beer-hall.
Hanfstaengl knew everybody who mattered in Munich but queried the name
of Adolf Hitler. He had never heard of him. At the Kindlkeller beer-hall
that night he listened and introduced himself. If he didn't know
Hitler's name, Hitler certainly knew his.
The Hanfstaengl home was the society hub to which he needed an entree.
He couldn't believe his luck. Promptly accepting an invitation, he would
soon meet that spectrum of infuential people so vital to his political
ambitions.
Two years older than Hitler, Hanfstaengl became his mentor on
everything from international affairs to the social graces, occupying a
unique position which raised jealousy in the rest of the pack.
The beautiful Mrs Hanfstaengl was having to fight off Hitler's
attentions, revealing to her husband that the little man was really a
neuter, suffering a complex about the syphilis he caught in Vienna in
1908.
Hanfstaengl told me of having studied his speaking technique and
concluded that the last few minutes were really an orgasm in words.
But one of his stories intrigued me more than most. Hanfstaengl had
befriended the Churchill family and, one night in the early 1930s, was
due to dine with them at the Hotel Continental in Munich. He was asked
to bring the Nazi leader with him but Hitler refused.
Over dinner he realised how vital it could be to bring together those
two men who had never met. Excusing himself to see if he could make one
last plea by phone, he reached the foyer -- to find the man himself
taking his farewell of a Dutch financier.
Surely this was it. Hitler in the foyer, Winston Churchill a few yards
away in the dining-room. In the dirty white overcoat and green hat,
Hitler said he was unshaven and in any case had too much to do. Who
knows if they actually caught sight of each other? It was the closest
they would ever come -- and we are left to ponder what might have
happened to the shape of twentieth-century history.
Hanfstaengl accompanied Hiter to Berlin when the Nazis took power in
1933 and was regularly on call when the Fuhrer couldn't sleep. Taught by
a pupil of Liszt, he sat down and gave me a demonstration of how he used
to play a lullaby for the monster. Hitler's favourite late-night music?
Irving Berlin's Russian Lullaby!
Increasingly concerned about the course of events in Germany,
Hanfstaengl eventually fell foul of his old friend and fled to Britain
in 1937. With the war, he was sent to Canada but managed to contact his
other old friend, President Roosevelt, at the White House. And that was
where he landed -- as the President's adviser on political and
psychological warfare against Hitler!
Back in his Munich home, we would sit far into the night and dispose
of a few bottles of wine, discussing this little-known chapter in the
creation of Adolf Hitler. Hanfstaengl and I became friends and it was an
incomparable kind of history lesson when I took my three sons to visit
him in that house of ghosts.
It all came back last week, as we laid the Second World War to rest.

AN ingenious device to control the major problem of sea lice, the
scourge of the salmon-farming industry, could save the industry millions
of pounds, it was claimed yesterday.
The device, which is to be nominated for a Scottish innovation award,
works by mimicking the shimmering effect of light reflecting off a
salmon's scales.
It attracts and traps the lice, then pumps them into a filter -- from
which they can be extracted to be processed as food for other farmed
fish such as turbot and halibut.
The parasites can cost an average-sized fish farm about #150,000 a
year to control, and many farms face a continuous battle to keep fish
free from infestation.
The most common method has been by chemicals but these are expensive
and can harm the fish unless carefully controlled, said the Glasgow
Development Agency, which nominated the device for the John Logie Baird
Awards.
Another method is to use the wrasse species of fish, which feed off
the lice, but these often cannot keep up with the explosive rate of
infestation.
The device, developed by a Glasgow company, Terecos, has proved ''100%
successful'' in tank trials, and is now being tested off the west coast
of Scotland.
The company estimates an average-sized farm would need 10 of the
devices, at a total cost of #250,000.
Mr Baxter Binnie, of Terecos, said: ''Salmon farmers are under
pressure to find other methods of solving the infestation problem
because, while the use of chemicals is now allowed under licence, this
may not always be the case with continuing changes in environmental
legislation.''
Mr David Walton, of the GDA, said: ''This is a genuinely innovative
approach to what is a major problem for an important economic sector in
Scotland.''

THE controversial programme of exhibitions at Glasgow's Tramway has
been shortlisted for one of the most lucrative arts awards in Britain.
Tramway is the only Scottish company or institution on the shortlist
in any of the Prudential Award's five categories: dance, music, opera,
theatre, and the visual arts.
Announcing the list at the Portfolio Gallery in Edinburgh, Sir Peter
Wright, of this year's dance panel, said the prize money, which amounts
to #100,000 for the overall winner, was intended ''to enable people in
creative work to get on with what they should be doing''.
Tramway, in common with others shortlisted, receives #5000. The winner
in each category is then awarded a further #20,000 and the overall
winner receives a further #75,000. That award was made last year to the
Vale of Glamorgan Festival of contemporary music when Herald music
critic Michael Tumelty was one of the panellists.
A row blew up over the content of Tramway's exhibitions in May when
another Herald critic, Clare Henry, took issue with the premise of the
show Trust, arguing that the kind of conceptual art being championed by
the venue was ill-explained and of little interest to many people.
Mr Charles Esche, visual arts officer at Tramway, defended his
programme in these pages before a lively debate in the venue that showed
the city's arts community to be deeply divided on the question.
This weekend, sculptor Anthony Gormley, one of the Prudential judges,
said: ''Charles Esche has done an extraordinary job. Tramway is the
strongest, most committed, and most visible internationally of the
younger institutions.''

RARE sightings of the Camberwell Beauty, a migrant butterfly which
despite its name rarely ventures into Britain, have been made in
Scotland.
Butterfly Conservation said yesterday that one had been spotted in the
Sutherland area and another as far north as Shetland. And the species is
being seen throughout Britain in greater numbers than any year since
1976.
The hot weather, combined with predominantly easterly winds, has
pushed the deep burgundy-coloured visitor across from its main northern
and central European breeding grounds. The few that migrate to Britain
are usually found only on the south and the east coast as far north as
Norfolk. But this year, apart from the Scottish sightings, one had been
seen in Northern Ireland for the first time since 1969 and for only the
fourth time ever.
It was not clear when the last time a Camberwell beauty had been
reported in Scotland, but Mr Gary Roberts, of Butterfly Conservation, an
organisation dedicated to saving wild butterflies, moths and their
habitats, said it was ''an extremely rare occurrence''.
He added: ''So far this summer we have had 61 confirmed sightings in
Britain, which as far the the Camberwell Beauty is concerned, represents
a major invasion. This is the biggest build-up since 1976, when there
were 300 sightings, and if the hot weather continues with easterly winds
for another month, there is no reason why numbers should not approach or
even exceed the 76 figures.''
Most sightings of the Camberwell Beauty -- so named because it was
first spotted in Britain in Camberwell, south London, in 1748 -- have
been in garden orchards, where rotting plums and apples, in particular,
are a prime target.
British butterfly watchers were alerted to the build-up of Camberwell
Beauties by Dutch entomologists monitoring the migration across the
channel. The species is classified as endangered in Holland.
In America, the Camberwell Beauty is called the Mourning Cloak because
of its dark appearance.

LEADING QC Michael Mansfield claimed yesterday that the television
coverage of the O J Simpson trial had set back the campaign to allow the
broadcasting of English court cases 50 years.
Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, he said
that he no longer expected to see the televising of trials, criminal or
civil, during his lifetime.
Mr Mansfield, one of England's eminent QCs and an advocate for
allowing cameras into courts, said: ''The public is so scared about what
would happen to British trials if TV were allowed in to film because it
is such a market-orientated media. I can understand their anxiety.''
He was speaking after a debate, TV On Trial, which ended with a jury
of 15 members of the general public voting 10-5 against the televising
of court cases. The audience, all media delegates attending the
festival, voted overwhelmingly in favour of cameras in court.
Mr Mansfield admitted that part of the problem was the fact that you
could not trust broadcasters to produce court programmes because they
were working in the commercial sector.
''The industry only has itself to blame because it is there to make
money. Justice may not be their interest,'' he said.
However, he felt strongly that it was important for justice to be seen
to be done.
Mr Mansfield, who has defended in some of England's most celebrated
trials -- including the successful appeal by the Birmingham Six --
argued that cameras should be allowed in court under strict regulations.
He said that if anyone involved in a case felt that they could not
perform their duty under television's eye, then the judge should rule
against televising the case.
Unlike England, the Scottish legal system has already permitted the
televising of court cases thanks to a ruling by Lord Hope, Lord
President of the Court of Session and the country's highest judge. Both
Scottish Television and the BBC have broadcast programmes which included
material filmed during court cases.
Speaking against the televising of court cases in the debate, Mr
Donald Findlay, QC, one of Scotland's senior lawyers, said the danger
was that TV companies would be selective in what they broadcast and
would go for cases which would attract the ratings.
''If you have highlights shown then it could influence juries involved
in the case who might watch it at night,'' he warned.
The Scottish court programmes which had already been broadcast had
shown excerpts from the evidence but had not in any sense explained what
the case was about.
He added later: ''I accept that there are times when I read newspaper
reports of cases in which I was involved and I wonder if the reporters
were at the same case. But the thing about newspapers is that you have
to buy them and then open them and then read them. People at home switch
on the television and it comes to them whether they want it or not.''

<HEADLINE>Cement replacement for traditional lime mortars is rocking the foundations of Scotland's heritage. Castle walls come crumbling down. Under siege and literally coming apart at the seams</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S heritage is coming apart at the seams, as hundreds of
ancient castles and stately homes crack up because modern restorers used
cement instead of traditional lime mortar.
The cost of making good the damage to historic buildings, including
National Trust for Scotland properties and privately-owned listed
buildings, will run into millions of pounds, much of it from grants,
according to heritage experts.
In some cases, restoration carried out within the past 20 years is
having to be stripped out because cement was used.
Building conservationists have admitted they were unaware of the
damage modern cement could cause to old buildings originally constructed
with a mixture of local lime and gravelly sand.
Restoration work at Culzean Castle, in Ayrshire -- repairing damage
caused by cement -- is expected to cost in the region of #10m, half of
which will come from grants funded by the taxpayer, and half from the
National Trust for Scotland appeal.
Cement-based harling (rendering) put on Morayshire's sixteenth-century
Brodie Castle in 1980, has had to be stripped off and replaced with the
lime mixture after water seepage threatened severe internal damage.
Duart Castle on Mull, built in the thirteenth century and seat of Sir
Lachlan Maclean, chief of Clan Maclean, has suffered major damp problems
as a result of restoration using cement mixes.
Late sixteenth-century Culross Palace, in Fife, is facing major work
as a result of rising damp caused by cement mortar repairs.
In Aberdeenshire, the jewel of the National Trust's castles,
Craigievar, may be in need of repair to harling put on in the late
1970s.
Architects at Historic Scotland which grant aids major restorations
have admitted they did not understand the damage cement mortars could
do.
For years, the old Ministry of Works and its successors, including
Historic Scotland, recommended a cement mix for repair work. Payment of
grants frequently depended on use of the approved mixture.
''With hindsight, we now know that in many cases the use of cement
mortars led directly to accelerated decay of brickwork and stonework,
with immense loss to the heritage.
''Instead of repointing a wall every century or so, you are maybe
faced with replacing whole masonary units or even complete
reconstruction,'' admitted Mr Robin Kent, senior conservation architect
with Historic Scotland, which this week is hosting a major lime
conference and practical demonstrations at Queen Margaret College,
Edinburgh.
Brittle, water-proof cement mortar sets hard, cracks, and produces
salts damaging to stonework. The problem is acute on sandstone buildings
in the south of Scotland.
In Grampian, which has one of the largest concentrations of castles
cased in traditional layers of harling, buildings are in danger as water
becomes trapped behind impervious cement mortar, which cracks with the
natural movement of buildings.
Traditional lime mortars, used for 4000 years, also let in damp. But
they ''breathe'' at the same time, and let it out. Lime mortar, softer
than cement, is also less prone to cracking as stone shifts with time.
Cement became popular in the latter half of the nineteenth century,
after Portland cement was patented by Leeds mason Joseph Aspdin, in
1824. Easy to use, it was ideal for house building and major civil
engineering work. Inexperienced workers could be quickly trained to use
it.
But traditional methods of preparing and applying lime mortar have
been largely forgotten.
''We know now what the problem is. But there is a real shortage in
Scotland of tradesmen trained in the use of lime. It may take longer to
put on than cement, but the saving comes in future repair bills,'' said
specialist mason Tim Meek, from Tain, Ross-shire, currently restoring
the church at Lochgoilhead, Argyll, using long-forgotten traditional
methods.
Historic Scotland is now producing new guidance for restorers. It is
also carrying out a nation-wide survey of old lime quarries which could
be reopened to produce raw material for local restoration projects.
Charlestown quarry, on the north bank of the Forth, was once the
largest producer of lime in Europe.
Mr Kent said: ''We are encouraging a rennaissance in the use of lime
north of the Border.''

FOLLOWING the recent report from Michael Meacher, MP, on Labour's
plans for the bus industry and your subsequent editorial, UK bus
operators will be gratified by your recognition of the central role
buses can play in an integrated transport network (August 23).
Mr Meacher wants the industry to develop and diversify so as to
provide the best possible service for the passenger. It is already doing
so. The industry would be most concerned at any policy of regulation
which might stifle this process.
Even the strongest critics of a deregulated bus market admit that it
is market driven and responds quickly to customer needs. This has
resulted in increased bus miles and more innovative and
passenger-friendly services. Mini and midi buses now penetrate parts of
towns and cities previously untouched by public transport.
The decline in bus ridership started long before deregulation was even
considered and can be directly linked to the increases in car ownership
and use and a reduction in real terms in the cost of motoring between
1984 and 1990/91.
In many urban areas the decline has now not only been arrested but
ridership is on the increase. The amount of bus travel in rural areas
has increased by 19%.
It is vital new policies do not create a regime which stifles
competition and investment. It is noteworthy that some 85% of bus
services in the UK are provided on a commercial basis. The suggested
central planning of routes from town halls up and down the country will
eliminate choice for the passenger and will cost a lot more money.
The proposal is an overkill when some fine tuning of the present
system would be more appropriate.
Mr Meacher is right to be concerned about predatory activity. However,
both the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission already have powers to restrict the activities over which
there is concern. What they need are sufficient resources to ensure that
they are able to exercise these powers quickly and efficiently.
It is crucial that the industry be allowed to build upon the
successful foundations that a consumer-led industry allows. To
re-regulate now would be disastrous not only for the operator, but more
importantly for the passenger.

OVER the last 20 years the restoration of New Lanark has created one
of the most visited tourist sites in rural Scotland, but the village has
absolutely no control over public transport (August 15). The current
decay of this public service infrastructure serves to emphasise the
deficiencies about which Ralph Barker writes.
When faced with signs of such obvious decay inside Lanark railway
station it seems almost irrelevant that New Lanark has been unable to
locate visitor information in the station, on any consistent basis, for
over 10 years.
Our latest approach, prompted by Herald correspondence, was rejected
on the basis that ''it is not the job of ScotRail staff to provide
information other than on train timetables''.
This is a polite version, with local colour and vehemence removed.
National intervention from ScotRail has previously produced only
temporary remissions.
Your correspondents are absolutely correct in their view that as a
community we ought to be able to organise it better than this.
Travelling to New Lanark by public transport ought not to be a classic
case of failure to achieve transport integration and provide
information. However, it does seem unreasonable to castigate an
underfunded Conservation Trust, dedicated to the restoration and
development of New Lanark, for failures which it has tried to correct
but are quite beyond its control. Those who want to complain about the
buses and railways should at least give us the chance to run them.
There are actually similar problems relating to motorists. The most
obvious difference is that it is within our capability to provide a
reasonable rural car-park, and this we do. In fact, we are receiving so
many visitors that we are about to double the car-park size.
Traffic management on public roads, however, is also quite beyond our
control (see The Herald, May 1992). For us this represents a major and
increasingly important issue, and is similar in context to the failures
experienced in public transport arrangements.

I WAS pleased to see Elizabeth Buie drawing attention to the immoral
calculations of the working party of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change which reckons that one Western life is worth 15 in the
Third World (August 21).
It is such crazy calculation which gives rise to another recently
published proposal that, instead of taking action to prevent global
warming, we should simply compensate the Third World peasants who lose
their homes to the rising tide. Presumably then it would be in our
interests to keep them poor so that the bill was minimised.
Rather than considering that the poor are not worth saving, we should
reflect upon the over-consumption and over-pollution by the North and
conclude that the earth cannot afford to keep the rich nations in the
style to which we have become accustomed.
Strategies which seek to move us towards a sustainable Scotland have
to be based upon the principle that we all have an equal birthright to a
sound environment and set targets accordingly rather than ask the poor
to bear the cost.

William Russell surveys the award-winners in a capital selection at
this year's Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival
THE Michael Powell award for the best new British feature film at the
Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival has been won by Small Faces made by BBC
Films and directed by Gillies Mackinnon.
Written with his brother, Billy Mackinnon, who also produced it, the
film is set in a Glasgow council estate in the late 1960s and deals with
the razor gangs of the period, an image of housing estate violence
Glasgow has long since shaken off.
It now has an 18-month ''window'' during which it can get a cinema
release before being shown on television. The Powell award will help
ensure that a distributor picks it up.
The prize was presented last night by French star Leslie Caron before
the closing gala film Funnybones in which she stars.
The plot of Small Faces is not autobiographical, although the
Mackinnons grew up in Glasgow in the 60s.
Billy Mackinnon said it was about a working-class family at a period
under the Wilson government when there were opportunities for
working-class children to better themselves.
''If we had been born a generation earlier we would have been plumbers
or policemen, not film-makers,'' he said.
Gillies Mackinnon said education had been a right then and
working-class children could go on to higher education, to university.
That right had been lost. The white heat of technology may have turned
out an illusion in the long run, but not at the time.
When asked if they worried about people saying they were giving
Glasgow a bad name by portraying razor gangs, Gillies Mackinnon said:
''Nobody says Martin Scorsese gives New York a bad name.
''I think there is a danger in Scotland, and this suspicion we were
making a film about razor gangs is a reflection of it, in the way we
present ourselves through Taggart and Hamish MacBeth. We don't think the
film is a caricature. We are trying to tell a truthful story.
''It would be wonderful if Scotland would kick start itself out of
this caricature. It would be great to make films about Scotland in the
present. Historically Scotland has always been the little brother of
England. We seem locked into that. All this anger against England. It is
not that important.
''We must grow up and be ourselves, accept ourselves, redefine
ourselves, and film, because this is a cultural issue, is a very good
vehicle for that. Let us hope there will be more Scottish films.''
The brothers said they felt their involvement in film making was
international rather than national, and Small Faces was a case of coming
back to make a Scottish film. They were very interested in what a
Scottish film could and should be in the future.
The other winners were:
Best Gala Film voted for by the audience -- Bombay directed by Mani
Ratnam.
Channel 4 directors award -- joint winners, Cold Fever directed by
Fridrik Thor Fridriksson and Young Poisoner's Handbook directed by
Benjamin Ross, both of which had their European premiere at the
festival.
Post Office McLaren animation award went to -- Pib &amp; Pog, from Aardman
Animations.

A WOMAN has won the Perrier Award for Comedy for the first time in the
competition's 15-year history.
Jenny Eclair wins #3000 and performances at Her Majesty's Theatre in
London in October.
She was chosen from the shortlist of Simon Bligh, Scott Capurro,
Boothey Graffoe and the Umbilical Brothers by a panel which included a
journalist, three members of the public and Paul Spencer, head of comedy
at ITV.
Between them they saw 600 performances during the last couple of
weeks.
Eclair, 35, from London, is performing her show Prozac and Tantrums at
the Pleasance during the fringe.
Best newcomer award went to Tim Vine, who is also performing at the
Pleasance.
Eclair, accepting the award to loud cheers, said: ''I feel like an
arse, my skirt is too short and I feel like the first blonde in space.
I'm going to cry my eyes out and then I'm going to be sick and then hide
under my duvet.''
She added: ''Thanks for giving me the old dog ticket.''
Afterwards she said she was delighted to be the first woman winner,
although she felt Jo Brand, previously shortlisted, should have beaten
her to it.

I UNDERSTAND that the strategic reservoir at Balgray Dam (between
Barrhead and Newton Mearns) normally contains billions of gallons of
water. Now, when water is supposedly in short supply, the reservoir has
been emptied.
How can the powers-that-be justify the emptying of the local reservoir
at the same time as sticking notices on Eastwood residents' front doors
urging us to save water and saying ''Don't leave the tap running when
brushing your teeth''?
Surely teeth water would be a drop in a reservoir.

<TEXT>
IT WAS impossible to read both Robbie Dinwoodie's and Ken Smith's
accounts (August 23) of the latest shenanigans in the Scottish
Constitutional Convention regarding the proposed fiscal powers of ''the
Scottish parliament'' without mounting alarm.
If its autonomous revenue-raising powers are now to be systematically
undermined to the point where they are virtually non-existent, then the
jibe of the SNP's ''fundamentalist'' wing that the the supposed
parliament will be little better than a talking-shop with less real
power than even an un-glorified county council or new unitary authority
will acquire increasing credibility.
In this respect, it is ironic that the only effective rebuttal to date
of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's tawdry equation of the putative
assembly's proposed fiscal powers with a ''tartan tax'' was given not by
the convention's official spokespersons but by the SNP's business
spokesperson, Fergus Ewing, in his excellent article, also on August 23.
Mr Ewing's central point about the banding differentials in the
council tax base -- which clearly discriminate against Scottish
householders -- being tantamount to a ''tartan tax'' which we already
pay for the ''privilege'' of remaining in the Union is well made, and
ought to be taken on board by both the Scottish Office and the
convention alike.
Moreover, there is at least one other ''tartan tax'' from whose
imposition we Scots currently suffer. It is called Petroleum Revenue Tax
and is levied on Scotland's North Sea oil and gas resources, netting an
estimated #1.4 billion for the Treasury in 1993/94.
Surely it cannot be beyond the wit of Canon Kenyon Wright and his
colleagues on the convention to insist that a minimum -- of say 51% --
of these oil and gas revenues should be automatically assisgned to the
Scottish parliament along with all VAT, corporation and income tax
receipts raised or sourced in Scotland.
With such additional ''assigned'' revenues at its command, it might
then be possible for our parliament actually to lower income-tax levels
below the Treasury rate, thereby finally confounding Michael Forsyth's
absurd scare tactics.

THE co-owner of the UK's most successful bus company is set to put the
finishing touches to a personal rags-to-riches fairytale by buying one
of Scotland's grandest castles.
Ann Gloag, who with her younger brother, Brian Souter, has built a
multi-million pound fortune from their Perth-based Stagecoach company,
is favourite to complete a deal to buy the historic Beaufort Castle, the
ancient seat of the Frasers of Lovat.
Yesterday Mr Giles Foster, the late Lord Lovat's cousin and estate
factor, confirmed that Mrs Gloag had placed a competitive bid for the
spectacular Highland castle, valued at #1.3m, near Beauly,
Inverness-shire.
Mrs Gloag also confirmed her bid, but said she was waiting for Lovat
estates to make a formal statement on the sale at the end of this week.
''There are a vast number of bidders and, due to a number of factors, I
don't want to say anything else until Lovats have issued their
statement,'' she said.
However, she added that her interest was to buy the home for her own
family, and rubbished reports in a Sunday tabloid newspaper that her
brother had bid for Beaufort Castle as ''unbelievable''.
Mr Souter, meanwhile, told The Herald: ''I found that report to be
incredible. It was a load of nonsense and way off mark, as I am not
involved in this deal whatsoever.''
Mrs Gloag, who grew up in a Perth council house, would have no trouble
in raising the asking price for the castle. She and her brother have a
joint personal fortune of more than #174m.
The Stagecoach empire began 14 years ago when the brother and sister
partnership began ferrying workmen around for companies in two
second-hand buses. Today the company is Britain's biggest bus operator,
with a fleet of 6300 vehicles, 19,500 employees over the world and a
turnover of #400m.
The tragic Lovat Fraser family has been forced to put its 23-bedroomed
home of the last 500 years on the market to settle debts of more than
#7m with a series of banks, run up by the former Master of Lovat before
he died last year.
The new Lord Lovat, 18-year-old Simon Fraser, will retain only a tiny
proportion of the Lovat lands, which once stretched from coast to coast.
His new home is a humble, five-bedroom farm house near the castle
which was once occupied by an employee's family.
His grandfather, the wartime commando hero, the 15th Lord, died on
March 16 this year, aged 85, after suffering the death of his two sons
within days of each other.
The younger son, Andrew, 42, was gored to death by a buffalo while on
a safari in Tanzania exactly a year before his father's death, and 10
days later Simon, 54, the Master of Lovat, died of a heart attack.
Simon took over the running of the estate in 1964, in a move designed
to cut the liability to inheritance tax. But this proved a disaster for
the family as he was an unlucky businessman, running up huge debts and
selling off parts of the Lovat lands.
Investments in racehorses, a mineral water plant and at Lloyd's of
London all floundered.
The sale of the estate in 39 lots for a total of around #6m became
inevitable after Simon's will revealed debts of #7.4m to banks, the
Inland Revenue and various other creditors.
Yesterday Mr Foster said that a rumoured bid from Lord Lovat's
daughter, Tessa, the wife of international banker Henry Keswick, had not
materialised by the closing date for offers earlier this month, dashing
the last hopes that the castle could stay in the hands of the family.
He confirmed that full details of the sale, including that of the
castle, would be made within the next fortnight.

IN promoting the ''assigned budget'' (ie block grant) solution to the
intractable issue of funding a Scottish Parliament, George Robertson MP,
Jim Wallace MP, Canon Kenyon Wright, Alf Young, and your leader article
(all August 24) conspicuously avoid the crucial question.
Why should English, Welsh, and Ulster MPs vote (the current
excessively generous) equalisation funding to a Scottish Parliament
which, in the absence of a Scottish Secretary, would not be accountable
to them and their constituents?
The sordid answer is as follows. ''If they don't let us have our cake
and eat it, then it will be their fault if Scotland leaves the Union.''
And the obvious riposte to that tawdry attempt at blackmail would
deservedly be: ''if you insist'' (although I think it would be put
rather less politely!).

IN his determined efforts (August 24) to give devolution teeth Canon
Kenyon Wright should beware. The important issues regarding Scotland
will be dealt with by the Parliament at Westminster and if the Canon and
his supporters continue to push their expensive ideas too far then one
can envisage further retreats on devolution by the Labour Party as the
General Election nears.
Like most Nationalists Canon Wright's language is flowery, to put it
mildly. He speaks of ''purposive vision'' for Scotland. What is this
vision he finds so desirable? What is Scottishness? Do we base it on the
Glaswegian from Bridgeton or from Kelvinside? Or is the flavour of
Aberdeen or Dumfries to dominate? Perhaps the Gaeldom of the Western
Isles, where my parents were born, is the essential ingredient in this
hotch-potch of a nation. Or is it purely an economic conception?
Roughly a decade or so ago Scotland lost its main industries, coal,
iron and steel, and shipbuilding and yet here we are a country of less
than five million advocating either full or partial withdrawal from the
UK, or 50 million, in the idiotic hope that being commercially adrift we
could do better.
In the land of Jock Tamson's bairns we do indeed foster our own
delusions.

IN response to Katie Wood's feature on business travel (August 19), Dr
Neil Maclean makes the point that the seat pitch in British Airways'
Club World cabins does not match that of other airlines.
This fact has also been brought to our attention through our own
consumer research as a result of which increased seat pitch in the Club
cabin is one aspect of a whole package of improvements which the airline
will announce in September.
We do, however, appreciate the recognition given to British Airways in
Katie Wood's article. We were the first airline to offer arrivals
lounges and a sleeper service for our international passengers, and in
the UK we are the only carrier with on-board telephones.
These are only a few of the benefits we currently offer our
passengers, there are many more in the pipeline.

THE fact that rail privatisation is now regarded as a serious
electoral liability (ScotRail's tender put on hold, August 14) may yet
give the Government an excuse for fudging the full implementation of
this bumbling and expensive farce.
Other Conservative/Right Wing regimes throughout Western Europe see no
contradiction or compromise of principle in supporting well financed,
publicly owned, efficient, and better used rail systems of which its
passengers and employees are justly proud.
There is still time for this Tory administration to grasp the reality
that rail privatisation is an electorally unwanted piece of ideological

A BLIND Scottish university graduate has been selected from more than
1000 candidates to receive a prestigious award to fund research into the
development of blind babies.
The Economic and Social Research Council award, worth more than
#20,000, will allow Dundee University psychology graduate Julie Rattray
to research into how visual impairment affects babies' development.
A further #7500 has been promised by the Royal National Institute for
the Blind to help fund the study, which will pay particular emphasis on
the effect blindness has in the interaction between babies and their
parents.
The award is all the more remarkable because Ms Rattray, who graduated
in July, has been blind since birth.
''Little work has been done on this important area,'' explained Ms
Rattray. ''The majority of research on early communication has been
carried out with infants who are following the 'normal' pattern of
development. We know very little about how visual impairment affects
that pattern.''
In the earliest stages of a baby's life, eye contact is an important
channel of communication between parents and babies who normally develop
a dialogue of smiles and looks long before language.
Over the next three years Ms Rattray expects to follow the progress of
a score of visually impaired babies and their parents, comparing the
four different combinations of sighted and blind parents with sighted or
blind children.
''One of the things I hope will come out of it is some practical help
for parents of visually impaired children.
''It can be so important to them for instance to be told if their baby
does not smile, or seems unresponsive, it is not their fault.''

A B ROBERTSON's letter was straight out of Peter Mandelson's book
(August 8). He attacks David Steel for supposedly changing his mind on
home rule and repeats the old lie about Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats
while never substantiating any of his claims.
After the election of a British National councillor in the
Labour-controlled Isle of Dogs both Labour and Liberal Democrats
launched inquiries into their respective parties' tactics and policies.
The Liberal Democrat inquiry found that there was no evidence of racism
within the party, but criticised certain tactics for which three people
were disciplined.
The results of Labour's inquiries were never released, but the faking
of canvass figures by Labour and the production of leaflets of a
blatantly racial nature went unpunished.
I am sure that A B Robertson is an expert on racial matters and knows
the problems of Britain's poorest borough as he lives in the thick of
things in Dunoon. But what is quite clear is that he understands very
little about politics. Anyone who believes that under the first
past-the-post system coming second is beneficial is either mad, a fool,
or has taken lessons in spin-doctoring from Peter Mandelson.

YOUR leading article in which you remark how heartening it was to
observe the interest shown by young people in the events of the Second
World War prompts me to raise the question of how Remembrance Day will
be observed in years to come (August 21).
It is obvious that veterans of the Second World War are now in the
older age group, and will be less able with each passing year to
contribute to the annual event. In order to have continuity it might be
thought suitable to involve the younger generation who are still at
school; in this way each year would produce a new group of young people
who would in effect carry the torch of remembrance for a year.
Our local primary school has done just such a pilot project this year
in connection with VJ Day. A selected class collected information about
the war years from relatives and others and recorded this using their
computer. Thus they have begun a permanent record of valuable local
history, and at the same time become involved in the act of remembrance.
After all, these children are closer in age to the men and women who
went to war than we, the veterans, are now.

RUGBY union had to change but the transformation which was announced
in Paris yesterday, and which has still to be digested by governing
unions and their supporters around the world, raises some uncomfortable
questions. There will be great relief that the absurdities and hypocrisy
which have infected the game in recent years will become a thing of the
past, especially as they have had such an unwelcome effect on the most
senior level. Because of the tensions created between unions committed
in varying degrees to administering an amateur game, and players who
could sense the proximity of substantial potential benefits, a gap
opened up between the two sides. Into that space slid seasoned
opportunists in the form of the Murdoch News Corporation's deal with the
southern hemisphere unions and Packer's bare-faced attempt to buy up the
game through the world's senior players and then lease it back to its
rightful owners. The effect of these money-led manoeuvrings was to
concentrate the minds of the unions on the danger that they were about
to lose control of the game which they purported to lead.
In a sense this can be seen as a harsh judgment on the leadership of
some. The Scottish Rugby Union is far from being an impotent
organisation as the building of the new Murrayfield illustrates clearly.
It was also the first union to come forward with serious proposals to
deal with the situation. The problem for the SRU is that, having
embraced the inevitability of a measure of professionalism in the game,
it is faced now with professionalism across the board, from the most
senior ranks to (potentially) the most junior. The Paris agreement is
far from perfect as it goes much further than many of the participants
expected. Nevertheless it has great benefits, not least the fact that
the game internationally is now capable of surviving as a coherent unit.
Just a few weeks ago this prospect seemed unlikely given the possibility
of a split between the northern and southern hemispheres. Thus, the game
has been saved, but at what cost?
The easiest part of the transformation will be at international level
where the SRU had already proposed that players should be put under
contract to the union and paid through a trust fund. This system is
likely to be adopted in Scotland, although the sums of money which are
reported to be available to English players might yet put pressure on
the SRU somehow to find similar sums of money. This will not be easy and
could be a cause of unhappiness in the future. Yet it is at club level
that the real impact will be felt. The Paris meeting believes that most
first-division clubs in most countries will be able to pay their players
something. Scottish clubs say that this is not the case and that their
finances are already stretched. Unfortunately for poorer clubs the open
nature of the new system will encourage a transfer market and might well
lead to a situation where the richer clubs, in particular those in
England, may be able to buy up all the best players. It is not clear how
this will operate in the best interests of rugby union. Scottish
football is dominated by the deep pockets of one club and although no
blame attaches to this it can hardly be said to have raised the general
level of that game. In addition, the unions will have to control the
club transfer market and this will not be an enviable task. Nevertheless
a radical and necessary step has been taken by rugby union and it is
welcome. The task now is to protect and nurture the lower levels of the
game which will continue to function as the foundation stones of the
future.

<HEADLINE>'Brazen homage to greed' under fire. BBC 'should axe lottery and charter'</HEADLINE>

THE BBC ought to ditch its National Lottery show and its charter
should be scrapped, a debate at the Edinburgh International Television
Festival was told yesterday.
The proposals came from Mr Steve Morrison, managing director of LWT,
who described the lottery as ''the most brazen homage to greed yet seen
on British television''.
Mr Morrison was among a panel of high-flyers who were asked how they
would solve the corporation's problems if they were in the director
general's shoes.
Mr Morrison, who started his broadcasting career at BBC Scotland, was
in no doubt as to what he would do. Producer Choice, the corporation's
much-criticised market forces ethos, would be phased out, the charter
would be scrapped, and the licence fee increased. He would also dump the
lottery.
The BBC's charter, he said, was a millstone around its neck because
the eternal fight for its renewal kept the corporation ''toadying to
Government''. Both ITV and Channel 4 were legislated for by Broadcasting
Acts of Parliament. The BBC's should be, too, allowing it to secure the
goals of flexibility and independence more effectively.
The licence fee was really the least worst way to pay for the BBC. It
now had to ensure that it was secure and sufficient. If they were able
to get people to pay between #100 and #140 for the basic Sky package,
then they could surely sell the BBC's services likewise.
Producer Choice, Mr Morrison admitted, achieved a degree of
self-management and freedom among programme producers, and there were
still further efficiency savings to be made. However, there would come a
point when the BBC's resources would be cut to ''below the most
conservative core of in-house production and the most talented staff
have been retained''. The object should be not to get more efficient in
order to cut back on programmes but to grow them even further.
He also said that the BBC's board of management -- currently 16 in
number -- was too large and apt to lose focus. It should be replaced
with a small executive board. It should also instigate a review of all
the layers of management. You can't throw a brick in the BBC without
hitting a manager, he quipped, and major surgery was needed. The
corporation should call a moratorium on commissioning any further
reports from management consultants.
Mr Nick Fraser, editor of BBC2's Fine Cut documentary series,
described the corporation as ''the ultimate great, good British place''
but said that it was insanely and maddeningly hierarchical.
''No-one enjoys organisations built in the spirit of control. These
days no one, given the choice, wants to work for them. When no-one is
left alone to make decisions, no-one makes them and everyone suffers.
For a long time the BBC was able to evade the consequences of its
muddled, half-hearted systems of control. It can no longer do so,'' he
warned.
It should constitute immediately a system of commissioning modelled on
C4's, with 10 commissioning editors who would have annual budgets to
spend on programmes both from independents and from the BBC departments.
The role of the two controllers would remain, but they would be
''primarily strategic''.
He did not think it appropriate that a corporation with a #1700m
turnover should be denied an overdraft -- but that was what the
Government had ruled.

SHE strikes a more imposing figure than her photograph suggested. It
is a fair guess that the fiercely Catalan Maria del Mar Bonet does not
suffer fools gladly. At the opening of Friday night's concert her
guitarist and musical director Feliu Gasull began by translating her
utterances for the benefit of the small audience. She simply refused to
leave gaps for his English and continued talking to us in native tongue.
For Bonet ''the Mediterranean is her continent'' (that was the last
utterance the hapless Gasull was allowed) and her repertoire takes in
songs from Naples (la Serenada, la Musica), Turkey, Greece, and Sicily
as well as the Balearics. The cross-cultural nature of all this was only
emphasised when one tune Temps de Calabruix (Time of the Hailstorm) was
accompanied only by bodhran-style drumming -- Catalonian or not, it was
not far from a Gaelic waulking song.
Her band was quite simply astonishing, particularly the guitar playing
of Gasull and Javier Mas on 12-string instrument. It is to be hoped that
last night's audience bettered the attendance at the end of the week,
for we were all quickly won over.

TO the drama of the A major sonata -- which formed the second of his
late-night Schubert recitals -- Andras Schiff brought the same precise
balance, flow, and beauty of tone as he had done two night earlier to
the glow of the G major. But this time there was a difference: the music
was treated as an entity, in no need of an encore, so that the recital's
powerful opening notes -- a vital ingredient of the sonata's structure
-- were its closing ones as well.
Yet the centrepiece of the performance was, as it should have been,
the sudden upsurge of emotion in the middle of the slow movement. Was
this remarkable passage, as the programme note suggested, the
Schubertian equivalent of a Bach fantasy or was it something darker and
more overwhelming than that?
Schiff's performance could be heard either way. More than is usually
the case, it seemed to grow out of what had already happened and to
recede back into it again. But at the same time, it was an outpouring of
Schubertian fury, a reminder that he was a composer of extreme moods,
not merely, as used to be said, a warbler of wood-notes wild.
Schiff was a pianist able to convey this aspect of Schubert's
personality, bringing an almost manic energy to the scherzo after the
alternating calm and explosiveness of the slow movement. But it was the
finale -- being a rethinking of the slow movement of the A minor sonata
he had performed two nights earlier as an encore -- that showed these
recitals to have an extraordinary unity of purpose. Second time round,
the main theme made a heightened, more feverish effect, completely in
keeping with the personality of the later work.
Once again, the excellent Bosendorfer piano chosen for these recitals
proved its worth, enabling Schiff to provide a wealth of rhythmic detail
that often goes unheard in performances that coat the music in thicker,
richer, tone.

Music
HOW appropriate that, when not performing, Argentina Santos should run
a restaurant. As she stood, clinging to her black shawl and singing with
the sort of expression that needs no translations, there was about her
an air of customer concern. Then, as her fellow singer, Carlos Zel,
ushered the troupe offstage to huge applause, the septuagenarian Santos,
visibly moved by the reception, gave off palpable ''shouldn't we be
giving them seconds?'' signs.
Zel, too, sings Portugal's Fado songs of displaced persons and mislaid
hearts with conviction, but with a slightly operatic flavour compared to
Santos, whose style is entirely natural and her dynamic control quite
astonishing. Both singers were given exemplary support by a string trio
which read their every move -- dramatic pauses, surges in tempo, phrases
dropping to a whisper.
Marvellous stuff, as was the solo spot on the sweet-toned, 12-string
guitarra portuguesa by Pedro Caldeira Cabral, a dead ringer for the
Band's Garth Hudson and a musician of similarly deep resources.

GENEROSITY in concert planning is not always something to be desired.
Saturday's programme by the Royal SNO not only overran its estimated
finishing time by half an hour but, by incorporating so many Mahler
Knaben Wunderhorn settings as prelude to Bruckner's Fourth Symphony,
actually proved self-defeating.
Emerging from their Wagner marathon of two nights previously, Donald
Runnicles and his players might have benefited from an evening less
arduous. Thirteen songs, when five or six would have sufficed, seemed in
the circumstances simply too many, especially as Mahler's is not an
integrated cycle such as Schubert's Winterreise. It is a compendium to
be dipped into rather than exhaustively unfolded. Boje Skovhus, in
particular, failed to produce the range of tone necessary to justify the
presence of all those drummer-boy settings.
His singing, while incisive, was sometimes too hectoring as if he was
constantly conscious of the need to cut through Mahler's orchestral
textures. Even the glorious Anne Sofie von Otter, to start with, sounded
less than fully at ease, though her deliberately blanched account of Das
irdische Leben was perfectly in keeping with music whose message about
hunger and starvation remains starkly relevant. Even more touching was
the tender sadness of her compassionate, beautifully floated singing of
Wo die schonen Trompeten blasen, though it too, cried out to be heard in
a less overcrowded context.
Trumpets, along with plenty of other brass, later blew their way
magnificently through the Bruckner symphony, even if the orchestra
initially sounded unpromisingly tired, and the opening horn calls were
less than magical. But through his tight grasp of the music, Runnicles
bound Bruckner's huge symphonic structure impressively together.
Real Brucknerian breadth may not have been his priority -- the
panoramic finale was never in danger of losing momentum -- but there was
no doubt about his sense of drama. Through the dynamic extremes of
searing fortissimos and almost inaudible pianissamos, his ability to
make Bruckner's big chords resonate round a not enormously resonant hall
was very striking.

Music
THE Swedish string quartet, the Yggdrasil Quartet, are the new kids on
the block. Resident artists to the City of Aberdeen, they haven't been
in the country that long. Having heard them just once, playing in
Aberdeen's Mitchell Hall, festival director Brian McMaster booked them
for this year's festival. And he can have been in no doubt yesterday
that his decision was justified.
They are superb. Their ensemble playing, technical command,
intonation, and homogeneity of sound are near-immaculate. They play
without strain. And yesterday, the Yggdrasils played in the last of the
Scottish Premiere series, staged jointly by the Edinburgh Festival and
the BBC.
Each of these three concerts has featured a world premiere. None of
them has been world shattering. The last, entitled Blood Foliage, was by
one of the young Turks, Magnus Robb. While it started decisively enough,
with aggressive rhythms -- suggestive of the urban influences of the
Dutch contemporary school (Robb has studied over there) -- it rapidly
lost direction and disappeared into a wallow of indulgence.
To stop the flow of the music dead and spend at least half of the
entire composition in an examination, instrument by instrument, of the
sound of overtones, may well have some intellectual justification in
terms of recent influences to which the composer has been exposed. As a
piece of music, however, it makes for something pretty deadly: no
melodic structure, rhythm, harmony, drive. Nothing. There's a lesson
there.
And the lesson was exemplified in deft and assured performances of two
other Scottish Quartets, Judith Weir's, suffused with lyricism and
atmosphere, and Robert Crawford's Second Quartet, a masterly work of
serene austerity and terse wit. Now then, Mr McMaster, what about
getting the Yggdrasils into the Queen's Hall series?

* SATURDAY: Drive up from Newcastle and move into flat. Fridge empty
so head off in search of supplies. Ten souvenir shops later, I know what
this town is about. You can buy bagpipes and fudge here in every other
shop, but food is harder to come by. Debate briefly how you would cook
bagpipes if you were stuck. Settle for fudge.
Fall into bed after obligatory three glasses of wine. On the wall
looking down are John, Paul, George and Ringo, framed separately, and
staring down like house gods. The show's about rock'n'roll and it seems
like a good omen.
* SUNDAY: Technical rehearsal. Happily Piers Ibbotson, the director,
turns up at the venue along with Pete Scott the man behind the music and
Simon Veit-Wilson in charge of the images and all things technical.
After the tech we're in high spirits and take off for food and wine. A
woman at the next table asks if we're performers. New to this game and
bursting with pride, I say yes. Ten minutes later she's flogged me her
CD. Tough town, I think, tough town.
* MONDAY: First performance, and a respectable first Fringe audience
of 25. Some serious first-day drinking in celebration. Fall into bed
(again) with too much wine inside me only to be woken a few hours later
by Piers saying ''Carol, now I don't want you to worry but there are two
policemen in the front room''.
Actually he's wrong. It's a policeman and a policewoman. Turns out
that Piers opened the front door to call down the flat and then fell,
half cut, into his camp bed and fast asleep. A watchful neighbour seeing
the door open called the police, and the first thing Piers knew about it
was a flashlight on his face and a voice requiring him to explain what
we was doing there.
The lounge, even after one day of communal living, is a tip of full
ashtrays, half-empty coffee cups and rolling leaking wine bottles. I
scrabble madly for the letter from the landlord -- by some miracle
turning it up. The constabulary depart what passes for the police as
''happy''. We're too wide awake then to go back to sleep.
* TUESDAY: Wake up to the harsh truth of performing. Your expected to
do this thing every day. The Herald party in the evening to which we've
kindly been invited.
We turn up like big girls blouses in our special One For The Money
T-shirts which we realise too late, looking into the room, is crass
because here in the National Gallery the dress code looks like its
Armani.
* WEDNESDAY: First serious leafleting. The kindest accept them with
quiet resignation, putting them on the pile laying over the left arm,
along with the rest. The cruelest leap back as if they've just heard
about some sort of new virus only contractable by the acceptance of a
leaflet.
* THURSDAY: Get up early to go to BBC Radio Scotland, so early we sit
around too long drinking tea, and thus forget to call the cab. They're
all busy so we jump into my car. It's raining heavily and the windscreen
wipers have packed up over night. Dig director out of bed and hare
through the traffic in his car.
Arrive at Radio Scotland with a couple of minutes to spare forgetting
the first rule of radio -- that you never go on at the time they tell
you. Twenty minutes later still sitting there. Great review in The
Herald which we use for new leaflet.
Spend the afternoon on the streets pushing it into people's hands.
Fall asleep with the words ''May I give you this. Great review in The
Herald,'' playing over and over in my brain. Wake up in the middle of
the night to find leaflets all over the bedroom floor. I think I've
really cracked. I've been leafleting myself.
* FRIDAY: Take in Stars Bar at the Assembly Rooms. Bizarre. Wall to
wall alternative comedians. Famous faces and those you almost know off
the telly.
Spend some time considering the collective noun for alternative
comics. A giggle is the obvious one.
* SATURDAY: Nothing to say but two words. Carmen Funebre. If you
missed them. Weep. Walk home, cabless but glad to be alive, from a
school playground somewhere at a comfortable end of town where I've just
felt a little of what it might be like to be not here but a part of the
war in Bosnia.
Think of Terminator with its astonishing morally ambiguous hi-tech
screen violence and think suddenly how cheap it seems confronted by the
truthful stilt-walking terror of Carmen Funebre. Wonder again at the
miracle of theatre.
* One For The Money is at Old St Paul's Churchhall (Venue 45) 12.30pm
daily until Saturday.

Clare Henry meets Richard Demarco whose ability to bridge the gap
between people, countries, and art is unrivalled
RICHARD DEMARCO: enfant terrible or elder statesman of British art? It
depends on your perspective. For my money he's on top form. But what of
the next five years? Happily there are several white knights on the
horizon to make his transition to eminence gris and roving
ambassador/programmer/co-producer as painless as possible. I've remained
a Ricky fan during 20 years of ups and downs, so my fingers are crossed.
Demarco celebrates his 29th Edinburgh Festival by presenting 33
exhibitions and 58 theatre productions from more than 20 countries
including Latvia, Lithuania, Bosnia, Serbia, Russia, Italy, Greece,
France, Hungary, America, and the British Isles.
Bridging The Gap is the name of his programme; bridging the gap
between countries, between people and between art and theatre is what he
does best.
Now 65, at an age when other mortals are slowing down, he's still in
overdrive, extending boundaries, taking the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to
Dundee, Kirkcaldy, and Traquair. He has just won his 26th Fringe First,
for Teatr Podrozy's breathtaking Carmen Funebre, plus a Herald Angel for
Yvette Bozsik.
Sadly thinking big always put the fear of God into small minds.
Despite this huge achievement and a phenomenal international reputation,
he's still viewed with a wary eye by much of the Edinburgh
establishment: truly a prophet without honour in his own land. Demarco
has always paid off his relatively small deficits through vigorous
fundraising and auctions. He is bitter but thriumphal. ''I've been an
Arts Council Free Zone for eight years now! Someone should look at my
books. I'm one of the few success stories in Scotland with a #6m
turnover since I started in 1966.''
Without Demarco I would never have been to Sarajevo, Belgrade, Mostar,
Timisoara, Warsaw, Ljubljana -- nor Pathhead, Kirkcaldy which I visited
last week in the company of Terry Sandell, director of Visiting Arts and
a group of Russians, Latvians and Poles who presented three foreign
language productions in the #2m refurbished Pathhead Halls.
Pathhead Halls is part of Fife College and Derek Huckle, principal of
Fife College, Ray Baker, chairman of Fife Enterprise, Sandall, plus
Hilary Strong, director of the Fringe, are Demarco's supporters.
''People totally fail to recognise Ricky's genius,'' says Sandell.
''He has an uncanny knack of coming up with totally brilliant ideas and
productions. He's been an important catalyst for years, presenting some
of the most exciting and innovative work on the Fringe. That he has done
it without major support is testimony to his total commitment, energy
and enthusiasm. This year's success at Dundee proves administrative
problems can be overcome if he works in partnership with other venues.''
Hilary Strong is the other strand in this new Demarco/Visiting
Arts/Fringe partnership. ''He's brilliant at the pzazz; at finding the
most wonderful things.''
Even the Arts Council's Andrew Nairne agrees. ''Who else but Ricky
could have thought of Dundee? A fantastic idea! His remarkable lateral
thinking keeps everyone on their toes and is crucial to Scotland -- but
his exhibition programme is usually itty bitty.''
Demarco's main show, Bread &amp; Salt: Lithuanian Art, is at Edinburgh
College of Art together with Casablanca Revisited from Morocco. Bread &amp;
Salt contains a few memorable images: Liskevicius'd aluminium objects,
good photos from Michelkevicute plus a veterinary series to put
Serrano's morgue picture in the shade, but overall is understandable
dated and darkly angst-ridden.
At Demarco's St Mary's School base, exhibitions by Russell, Izzo,
Whitaker, Beech and Martynchyk must fight for attention among theatrical
comings and goings. Few succeed like Donna Rae's dramatic ultra-violet
sculpture. Rae, a 1990 Glasgow MA graduate, made them from inch-square
black ceramic tiles once part of a Glasgow facade, now grouted in
flourescent paint to bridge the gap between art and science.
Dawson Murray and Barbara Balmer's garden paintings look fine in the
restaurant and lead onto Demarco's latest passion: gardens. ''Art is not
about entertainment but about life. We have all been looking in the
wrong direction. Beuys said, if you have to choose between a gallery and
a garden, choose the garden.''
Thus Demarco's summer school, La Galleria nel Giardino, journeyed to
the Festival via 30 gardens. Next year is Demarco's 30th Festival and
the 50th anniversay of the Edinburgh Festival. As Professor of Cultural
Studies at Kingson University and new adviser to the Ashford
International Festival, he plans to spread his garden net to Holyrood,
Falkland Palace and Pollok House. ''Glasgow would be ideal!'' he says.

SPIRITS in the Teacher's Round Britain Challenge sank to a new low ebb
yesterday when the two English yachts collided at the start of a
round-the-buoys race in Rothesay Bay.
The latest high seas drama followed Friday's debacle, which saw the 10
yachts in the Five Nations event reduced to nine when one of the two
French boats, the Belle Helene, foundered on rocks off the Ayrshire
coast in a Force 8 gale.
To cap a bad day before the mast, a Scots crew member of one of the
English boats jumped ship yesterday after what is believed to have been
a row on board.
As the nine boats jockeyed for position at the start line yesterday in
a Force 6 wind, Jacksons Landing -- Spirit of Hartlepool smashed into
the side of Spirit of London Docklands, skippered by round the world
yachtswoman Vivien Cherry.
Badly holed, Cherry's 36ft yacht immediately made for Largs Marina,
for repairs before the start of the third leg today. Jacksons Landing --
Spirit of Hartlepool also retired from the day's racing programme. None
of the contestants was hurt.
The blame for the incident rested with England Two skipper David
Alan-Williams, a veteran of four Whitbread races. and three Admiral's
Cups. He was on a port tack and should have given way to the other
vessel, on a starboard tack.
Vivien Cherry said: ''It appeared that he was bearing away, then he
hit us. It was just one of those things.''
There was further trouble for Mr Alan-Williams when Tim Grime, 40, a
marine pilot from Shetland, decided to leave the boat after a
disagreement with another member of the crew.
The race restarts this afternoon, when the yachts head out of Rothesay
Bay for Hartlepool, via the north of Scotland.
* All three races in the Laphroaig Trophy competition off Bute
yesterday were won by the Irish yacht, Dream of Erin.

TWO young men seen ringing doorbells and kicking over traffic cones
are being sought by detectives investigating the murder of the Edinburgh
woman found dumped in a drain behind a city tenement.
Police have appealed to them to come forward.
The decomposed body of 24 year-old Deirdre Kivlin was discovered 11
days ago beneath a manhole cover behind property in South Clerk Street.
The young men were seen about 2.30am on July 9 walking in the street.
Ms Kivlin left her Craigmillar home on July 8 and was last seen around
1.40am the following morning about 30 yards from the death scene.
''They were making their way to 100 South Clerk Street, the common
stair that gives access to the garden area where Miss Kivlin's body was
found,'' said Detective Chief Inspector Ian Cowden.
''Both men were seen ringing doorbells and kicking over traffic cones
as they made their way up the street.''
Mr Cowden said that from their actions it appeared they might have
been ''under the influence of alcohol or in high spirits'', but he
assured ''them that we will not be taking any action regarding their
behaviour''.
Police have described the two as being in their late teens to early
twenties, 5ft 10ins, of slim build with short hair.

THE artistic director of Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre has warned that
his company and the Edinburgh International Festival could suffer with
the reorganisation of local government.
Both face potentially damaging financial difficulties. At the
presentation ceremony for The Herald's awards for work during the
Edinburgh festivals, Mr Giles Havergal warned: ''We have to remember
that our ability to do this is based on subsidy.
''Both the Edinburgh Festival and the Citizens' are facing real
problems as Lothian and Strathclyde go out of business on March 31 next
year.''
The loss of regional council funding will strike the festival as it
celebrates its 50th year, an anniversary being celebrated by the
Citizens' next month.
The Herald ''Angels'' and ''Little Devils'' were presented at the
Festival Theatre on Saturday by actor and writer Marsha Hunt. The
Citizens' was presented with a Herald Angel for Philip Prowse's stunning
production of Schiller's Don Carlos, seen at the Royal Lyceum last week
and opening on Friday in Glasgow.
It was received by Mr Havergal, who plays King Philip of Spain, with
Sophie Ward, who plays his wife Elizabeth of Valois, and Julie Saunders
(Princess of Eboli).
Sasha Hails and Yvette Bozsik of Compagnie Yvette Bozsik were
presented with an Angel for the dance theatre performance Yellow
Wallpaper, the first large scale show by Ms Bozsik to be seen on the
Fringe.
A third award went to the short film Hunger Artist, directed by
Bernard Rudden and produced by Boxcar Productions. The 45-minute film
was premiered at the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival and was made for
less than #40,000.
A stylish version of a Franz Kafka short story using a cast with no
previous acting experience, it was shot in Glasgow.
Ms Hunt also awarded the latest batch of Little Devils, given to those
who have survived in the face of adversity in Edinburgh. Danielle Carlaw
received the award, announced last week, for Bluefest, the gay and
lesbian arts event which found itself plagued by venue problems.
The Royal Stuarts Scottish Performers Guild is a Californian
family-based company ''dedicated to the historic re-enactment of the
royal courts of Scotland during the 16th century'', who are performing
Mary Stuart, A Reign Revisited at Moray House Union. To save on travel
costs they wore their costumes on the journey over, and sold 11 tickets
on the plane.
When they arrived, writer, director, performer, and father of the
company Chip Clark was struck down by appendicitis, but insisted on
taking the stage only two days after having his appendix removed. A
Herald Little Devil recognises his commitment and the company's
resourcefulness.
The third devil was received by festival director Brian McMaster on
behalf of the Abbey Theatre of Dublin for their alarm-hit performance of
Observe The Sons Of Ulster Marching Towards The Somme at the King's
Theatre last Monday.
Apparently triggered by the heatwave rather than any real danger, the
fire alarm sounded less than half an hour into the show. The theatre's
Mr Ken Gray took his cue from the line ''the smoke from a Papist chimney
will never darken the sky of Bushmills'' and asked the audience to
evacuate the building.
When they returned twenty minutes later the alarm sounded again and
the performance was eventually delayed by almost an hour.

Theatre
BEHIND me a man is hooting like a goose. In front of me a couple sit
stony faced. I've rarely felt so much in the middle.
The appeal of Deschamps et Deschamps is an elusive one. Imagine an
earnest avant-garde theatre director being asked to put together a
light-hearted sketch show and the results might not be a million miles
from C'est Magnifique. Back in Edinburgh after going down a storm with
Les Petits Pas and C'est Dimanche in the Festivals of 1988 and 1989, the
company offers a peculiar combination of exquisite staging,
high-precision acting and silly walks.
The scene is some down-at-heel cafe-bar, a remote truck-stop, where
the pace is leisurely and workers have time on their side and a curious
way of filling it.
The set is all beer crates, boxes and planks -- the seven performers
perching on battered old stools or eating off crude metal plates,
tapping out rhythms on the crockery, breaking into ungainly dance
routines, or engaging in circular conversations in heavily-accented
French.
The humour has its roots in the knockabout clowning of the commedia
dell'arte, the sight gags of the circus and the silent movie and, most
of all, in the wistful, observational and very French comedy of Jacques
Tati. This is where the audience is split.
For some, like the man hooting away behind me, the vision of a young
man trotting across the stage with a trolley, his protruding buttocks
pushing his body into a distorted, imbalanced frame, is the prompt for
side-splitting laughter. For others -- I have to say myself included --
it produces not a flicker. For much of the earlier part of the show, the
comedy has this curiously refracted impact -- there is always someone
giggling somewhere -- and sometimes it is you -- but only infrequently
is the whole audience united in laughter.
Perhaps it is too much an open-ended series of routines to add up to
very much, yet still those routines have a compelling theatrical hold
(Yolande Moureau, in particular, is a fascinating stage presence) and,
even when it doesn't make you laugh, the production has a sense of
purpose, a choreographed control and a clean visual balance that is too
distinctive, too artful, too engrossing to dismiss. Funny ha-ha or funny
peculiar, it's a beguiling piece of work.

Music
FOLLOWING the pretty disastrous opening to their series of Schubert
song cycles last week, where tenor Peter Schreier's voice nearly fell
apart (he is reported to have said that, such was the condition of his
throat, if it had been anything other than the Edinburgh Festival, he'd
have cancelled), the second instalment, given on Friday night by
Schreier and pianist Andras Schiff, was, reportedly, more of a success.
Similarly, last night, for the final concert in the series --
Schwanengesang (Swansong) -- it could be fairly said that Schreier was
in better voice than the middle of last week. There are still
reservations to be noted. At either end of his range -- at the bottom he
lacks power, and at the top where, if compelled to sing loud, as in the
penultimate song of Schwanengesang, he tends to bellow embarrassingly --
there are weaknesses.
And the stability of his intonation was again questionable, with
repeated wavering, especially where he was required to sustain and
control a phrase. The gorgeous Standchen was characterised by an almost
breathless quality, devoid of calmness and its seductive curve.
Dramatically, however, Schreier was better focused: establishing,
holding, and projecting a mood -- particularly as the song cycle sank
into an expressionist blackness towards the end. Andras Schiff, locked
into the mood plunge, was at his darkly poetic best. And, earlier in the
cycle, the two had peaked in the seventh song -- Abschied -- where
Schiff produced a vibrant accompaniment with a weightless bounce in its
step and a spot-on sensitivity to colour.
Which leaves the fundamental question. Did they make a strategic error
in presentation? We can argue for ever whether Schwanengesang is a
proper cycle (or indeed two cycles in one) or a cycle with a superfluous
song at the end.
Schreier and Schiff decided the latter, snipped off the last song,
stuck in an interval, and tacked on a clutch of unassociated songs.
Maybe it's true that, after the black silence at the end of Der
Doppelganger, the last song is superfluous. It would have been nice to
have had the opportunity to judge.

THE Television Festival narrowly escaped the wrath of God -- and the
Church of Scotland -- yesterday by changing venue for a debate on what
causes offence to viewers.
Beyond the Pale, which included a series of shocking excerpts from
drama and documentary programmes, was to have been held in the sanctuary
of the Church of St Andrew and St George, but was switched at the last
minute to the nearby Royal College of Physicians.
Among the excerpts shown to media delegates were graphic scenes of
violence and sex.
The final clip, which shocked even hardened film makers, was a shot of
a hanging in the Middle East which was cut by Channel 4 from its recent
series on the death penalty.

STRATHCLYDE Police is to mount one of its biggest inquiries today -- a
major public opinion survey which will be carried out over the next four
weeks.
A team of 50 researchers will quiz 1000 householders on their
attitudes to crime, its expectations of its police force, and the
standard of service delivered by Strathclyde Police following major
internal changes made after the findings of a 1991 survey.
In that survey, 74% of people listed crime as among the three most
serious social problems in the region, ahead of unemployment, health, or
education.
More than 80% of those questioned had a positive perception of
Strathclyde and its officers, with 55% describing the force's service to
the public as excellent.
However, the survey also threw up complaints that officers were bogged
down by bureaucracy, and tended not to publicise their work efficiently.
More than 90% wanted to see more officers on the beat, with the same
percentage wishing to see the force more involved with its local
community.
The drugs problem was also viewed as the most serious crime facing
people in Strathclyde.
Since then changes have been introduced to tackle these concerns.
The civilianisation programme has released 270 officers to operational
duties. By the end of the programme, the number will be 519 officers.
Meanwhile, a series of high-profile campaigns have been carried out,
including Operation Blade, which tackled the carrying of knives;
Operation Turnkey, which came down hard on house breaking; and Operation
Eagle, the anti-drugs initiative which has seen 2064 arrests to date.
Mr George Macdonald, assistant chief constable, said: ''We will be
looking very carefully at the responses to the questionnaires, to see
how we can improve further.''

REPORTS of a ''non-aggression pact'' between Labour leader Tony Blair
and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown were denied yesterday.
The Independent on Sunday reported that an agreement was struck in a
meeting at last weekend's VJ-Day commemoration not to make personal
attacks on each other and to work together on a range of policies.
But a spokesman for Mr Blair said that no such discussion had taken
place.
''They had a brief and purely social conversation,'' he added.
A spokesman for Mr Ashdown said: ''The Liberal Democrats' position,
set out in May, has not changed. No quarter for the Tories and no let up
on Labour.''
Mr Ashdown has, however, made clear that he would not support the
Tories if the next General Election produced a hung Parliament.
Tory constituency associations are being urged to set up small teams
of grassroots activists to head the party's campaigning drive in the
run-up to the next election, it was confirmed yesterday.
Central Office said party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney had written to
constituency chairmen stressing the importance of getting over the
party's message on the doorsteps, and urging them to set up teams to
monitor the local opposition.
Labour meanwhile turned its fire on Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine. It warned it would be monitoring his performance to see
whether he was worth his #67,817 Ministerial salary.
Deputy Labour leader John Prescott, said Mr Heseltine's sole role was
to attack Mr Blair and Labour.
''His new role is all of a piece with what's happening since Major was
re-elected Tory leader. They've given up on government and devote their
energies to propaganda,'' he said.

Alison Daniels visits Londonderry, flashpoint of the Troubles, to see
whether the ceasefire has changed lives or even attitudes.
SECTARIANISM is subtle in Londonderry but it runs, like the River
Foyle that divides the Catholic Bogside estate from the Protestant
Waterside, through the heart of the city with two names despite the
peace dividend gloss.
Days before the anniversary of the ceasefire, it is tempting to seize
the positive. While resentment may seethe on either side of Belfast's
newly completed peace line, it merely simmers in this predominantly
Catholic city of 100,000 people close to the border with the Irish
Republic. Bickering is confined to the occasional rattling of sabres and
skirmishes. So far Derry has escaped the tit-for-tat beatings and
torching of churches, Orange Halls and homes, the night-time flames of
which have kept the culture of fear smouldering in other parts of
Northern Ireland in recent months.
As the men of politics, some enjoying their newfound role of statesmen
rather than gunmen, fret and posture over the state of the peace
process, tripped up on the issue of inviting terrorists in possession of
weapons to all-party talks, Northern Ireland holds its breath.
In Derry they have already started to breath. Long before the
ceasefire the city, with its Catholic majority, nationalist-dominated
council but alternating mayors and reviving economy, has been held up as
a model of an evolving peace. The crucible of the Troubles, which
witnessed the first troops on to the streets of the Province in 1969 and
three years later the massacre of 13 civilians in a hail of paratrooper
bullets on Bloody Sunday, also saw the first troops march back to
barracks last October.
Even a fortnight ago, at the end of a tense marching season, the
Apprentice Boys's provocative return to Derry's historic walls for the
first time since 1969, and the ensuing violence as the brethren marched
through the nationalist Bogside, failed to spark wider protest.
A week later tempers have cooled and the incident has been filed away
in the collective memory, mythologised into another milestone of Orange
triumphalism by one side, another example of RUC heavy-handedness by the
other.
In the sunshine, Derry looks better, normal, with the disappearance of
checkpoints and sandbags. There used to be just three roads leading into
Derry, now there are 25 zig-zagging across the border and fanning out
into the province. There is, say those in the city centre, a palpable
release of tension. The ceasefire means not automatically sitting near
an exit in a pub and bristling at the entrance of a stranger. It means
letting children out to play in the evenings and cutting the time of a
journey now the road blocks have gone.
And from their new glass-fronted offices with Gaelic signs, Derry City
Council marketing executives are keen to add an economic gloss to this
picture of ordinariness. Adhering to the peace dividend creed that the
impact of the ceasefire can be measured in cash, millions of pounds have
been spent on developments and the rebuilding of bomb-damaged buildings.
In the past four years low wages and cash grants have attracted overseas
investment in the shape of companies like American technology giant
Seagate, a Fruit of the Loom cotton spinning plant, and a #120m retail
complex complete with a Marks &amp; Spencer store. Last year European
regional development funding secured the opening of a new airport. House
prices have steadily risen.
The biggest spin-off of the ceasefire, says the council's marketing
director, Gerry Henry, has been a growth in tourism. Backpackers,
American accents, once-rare Irish Republic number plates, and a steady
stream of tourists from the mainland provide evidence to support
predictions that visitor numbers are up by more than 50%.
If unemployment stands at 15%, and in some areas of the city 70%, the
script is that Derry is catching up after being trapped for decades in
economic suspended animation.
There is also, from RUC sources in Derry, a tentative optimism that
the force can find its way back to the middle ground. In the past year
the number of calls each month for assistance has risen by a third, a
sign of a gradual restoration of confidence. Response times have fallen
from up to five hours to less than half an hour. The armoured
Land-Rovers are being replaced by cars, officers are being redeployed to
traffic duty. The force says its crime detection rate of 37% is one of
the highest in Northern Ireland even though, since the ceasefire, there
has been a slight rise in crime, particularly cross-border robberies.
Terrorism still casts a shadow -- there are on average four punishment
beatings a week -- but in the first six months of the ceasefire the men
patrolling the streets have peeled off layers of military hardware.
Rifles and flak jackets are, in the main, left inside the still heavily
fortified barracks. Officers drive to work in private cars rather than
arrive accompanied by military escorts.
The psychological armour and ingrained attitutes will take longer to
shed. There is a firm feeling that calls to disband the RUC are the
provocative rantings of embittered Sinn Fein supporters, devoid of any
legitimacy.
But the veneer of optimism is quickly scratched away in the housing
schemes that crawl up each side of the hills sloping down to the River
Foyle. Ironically, it seems that the removal of violence has seen a
greater openness in taking sides. Save for the twist that Protestants
are a minority, the grievances are predictable. Favouritism in the
allocation of jobs for the Catholic boys, RUC policing tactics, the
controversy over the release of paramilitary prisoners, a sell-out by
the IRA, a sell-out by the British Government.
Derry's 30,000-strong Protestant community, entrenched on the east
side of the Foyle and huddling in a small enclave, the Fountain, in the
nationalist so-called West Bank, are pessimistic about the likelihood of
the ceasefire holding. In the hinterland round the city out of which
emerged the Loyalist terrorists who killed seven people in the Rising
Sun pub in Greysteel, six miles from Derry, those with links to the hard
side of Ulster Unionism say the gunmen have not gone away. They are, it
is warned, as likely to forsake preparations for the resumption of
hostilities as the IRA are to agree to the decommissioning of arms.
Surveying the terraced streets fronted by red, white and blue kerbs
and festooned with Ulster flags and gable-end murals, Glen Barr, former
UDA political spokesman in the 1970s and now a community worker, has a
depressing vision. He sees little security in the creation of jobs and
can only imagine genuine inter-communal reconciliation with the
abandoning of links with both London and Dublin.
''There's a veneer of peace. The kids can go to the pub now but they
don't cross the bridge in any great numbers and some would probably
rather travel 30 miles to go to the cinema. The overwhelming majority of
Protestants do not believe in this city, in the city council.
Discrimination is levelled against Protestants. Catholics do not have a
monopoly on poverty.''
His views find some resonance in a trim 1960s Protestant estate on the
Strabane road heading south. A father playing rounders on a neat square
of grass says people adapted to the disappearance of the troops
remarkably quickly but feel the IRA want everything now. ''People liked
the money they were paid to go and commit murder. I want the peace to
last but I'm not that hopeful.''
A mother leaning on her front gate shrugs her shoulders at the
questions about the ceasefire. ''I don't like bringing children up in
the Troubles, but I don't think the IRA will change.''
Across the Craigavon bridge in the Bogside and Creggan estates,
Protestant pessimism is mirrored by Catholic impatience with the
political process, though there is a greater feeling that as people grow
accustomed to peace the ceasefire will hold.
Steep rows of terraced houses plunge down into the low-rise,
slogan-splattered flats which surround the Bloody Sunday memorial. Above
the estate close-circuit cameras and boom microphones swivel on a joint
RUC, army watch tower. A recently formed residents' group claim they are
being spied on. ''Time to go'' has been sprayed on the surrounding
corrugated iron fence.
A 19-year-old Catholic nursery assistant, working in the Protestant
Foyle Day Care Centre, is more optimistic than most. ''I would never
have gone to work there before. Yes, there are still some people who
intimidate you but I was brought up with an open mind. I think it's
changing here.''
But there are some for whom the memories of the past run too deep to
fade quickly. For the past three years a dozen relatives of those killed
on Bloody Sunday have met every Tuesday in a community centre with the
aim of seeking the prosecution of the paratroopers who opened fire on
civil rights demonstrators on January 30, 1972.
John Kelly was with his brother Michael, then aged 17, when they took
him dying to hospital. Righting perceived wrongs 23 years later is, he
says, important for the mental well-being of those immediately involved
but also if nationalists are to have any faith in a ''just peace''.
''Most people realise a declaration of peace is not enough but it is a
credit to the majority of Catholics that the peace was not shattered
with the release of Private Lee Clegg. Many people did not think they
would live to see a ceasefire holding and are hopeful that the guns can
be taken out of Irish politics. But there has to be a just peace. The
British Government want the nationalists to surrender, they want to go
back to 1969. A solution involves treating people with dignity.''
When the anniversary of the ceasefire on Thursday is added to the
roll-call of Northern Ireland milestones the voices of Derry must surely
dampen enthusiasm for celebration. While very few are prepared to beckon
the gunmen back there is deeply held sceptisim about the future.
On scaffolding resting against the gable end of a block of flats in
''Free Derry'' a group of men in Celtic football tops and shower caps
roller over a year-old mural with grey masonary paint, laying a base
coat for a new mural. They stop to describe what the painting will look
like; another memorial to Bloody Sunday, the past frozen on stone in
black and white.
''They say there's a lot more work coming to Derry though I haven't
got a job myself. Yes, life here has been better this year; it's more
relaxed and it's fantastic for the children. I don't want them to
undergo what we went through. I'm hopeful the ceasefire will last but I
think the RUC want the ceasefire to break. Relations here will never
improve. But if I'm honest with you, the truth is I don't know what can
really change.''
People liked the money they were paid to go and commit murder. I want
the peace to last but I'm not that hopeful

* Vivacious Cecilia Delatori is changing her award-winning recipe for
success -- to woo Richard Gere round to supper. Her one-woman Fringe
show about the raunchy actor took America by storm after collecting
accolades in Edinburgh two years ago. But hopes of a candle-lit
rendezvous where she could serve him the meal she cooks up on stage in
Tonight I'm Entertaining Richard Gere were dashed. Now Delatori thinks
she knows why; Richard hates meat -- and her cannelloni is stuffed with
motadella sausage! ''Mama mia!'' declared 32-year-old Delatori as she
switched to garlic and tomato for tonight's production at Marcos. The
actress with the smouldering Italian eyes learned of Richard's
vegetarian sympathies when he teamed up with veggie Damon Albarn, of
Blur, to back an animal rights campaign coming to Glasgow later in the
year. ''At last we'll maybe get to meet -- without the meat!'' said
Delatori, who's at Venue 98 until the end of the Festival.

WAKE UP Edinburgh! At last a piece of theatre that has some of the
rush of excitement that this year's Fringe has so far sadly lacked.
Okay, perhaps it doesn't provide quite the thrill of the fire-flirting
outdoor spectacles from Catalonia in previous festivals, but there's
still a real sense of occasion in this 45-minute performance by Poland's
Teatr Biuro Podrozy (another Demarco find).
It is, of course, disturbing that such visceral pleasure has been
created by a show inspired by the experience of Bosnian refugees, but
for all its beautiful imagery, like the small paper houses carrying
candles that are whisked away into the night sky by balloons, this is a
serious and sometimes disturbing work that is far from exploitative.
Giant stiltwalkers, fearsome soundtrack, burning costumes impaled on
wooden sticks, and a set that is destroyed every night . . . ah, yes,
the Fringe has begun.
Run now ended.

THREE tourists, played by Sandra Hall, Debbie Graham, and Jane
McGinnes -- go to Mull. By chance -- and through the intervention of
some Silkies -- they all see more of the island than they had planned.
The story-line spins back and forth from the islands past history to
the present day and beyond. The history is a cyclical pattern of
invasion and eviction, the present -- with its underlying debate about
the future of the fishing industry -- is, in its own way, yet another
instalment in a saga which sees man constantly exploiting the land and
sea for his own immediate ends.
Every part, from visitor to herring, silky to Viking invader, is
played by the versatile cast of three and though the narrative sometimes
confuses itself with rapid shifts, the performances themselves are
engagingly clear and effective.
Run now ended.

WORDS skip and somersault everywhere during this piece. They leap out
of Liz Aggiss's mouth, and then they seem to order her about: ''Bear
right, bear left, bear up, bear down, bare . . .'' is one hilarious
example where Aggiss, writhing to maintain propriety within the limits
of a teensy silver shift, dutifully discards her undergarments, again
and again . . .
Together Aggiss and Billy Cowie have devised a feast of eccentricity.
Love and mathematics, animals, eating -- dancing, too, with new material
inserted midweek -- are seen through a prism of his clever wordplay and
her brilliantly controlled dance. She goes from gawky to coy, from
fierce to fretful, her face as comically expressive as her body in a
show that gets its juxtas forever in the wrong position and leaves its
audience helpless with laughter.

IN AS much as this production by the Southsea Shakespeare Actors can
be considered a success, a great deal of the credit must go to director
Neil Reader.
Not for him the clutter and endless scene changes of so many amateur
productions (and professional, for that matter), but rather a brisk,
seamless interpretation that is alive with simple theatrical invention.
He sees to it that the text is crisply and intelligently delivered,
making sure that Shakespeare does most of the work.
There's a persuasive Prospero (Patrick Olliver-Kneafsey) and a strong,
earthly female Ariel (Deborah Paffett) but there are weaknesses as well
-- clumsy and unfunny low-life scenes among them -- and in the end it
feels more like the accomplished amateur show it is than anything an
inspired professional company might have produced.
Run now ended.

IN September one of these five painters will win #30,000, the most
valuable UK art award. Established last year as a protest against the
fact that pure painting is nowadays often regarded as a guilty
anachronism, one has therefore to wonder at the selection.
Professor Stephen Buckley shows 3-D mock gold-plated canvases which
are hardly ''pure painting''. Patrick Caulfield's still-lifes are ever
more abstract. Maggie Hambling takes an unusual tack, her portraits a
mass of writhingsnakes and paint trails on matt, soot black.
Karl Weschke, at 70 the oldest, also seems to have changed his style
-- but I bet he wins. So is each painter represented by an
uncharacteristic work -- or are all developing apace? Callum Innes, the
baby and sole Scot, looks very assured, a strong contender I believe.
His abstract elegance is very convincing, very powerful -- especially in
this rather odd company. Keep your fingers crossed he wins.

STOP-MOTION black and white video-loop of galloping horses, onstage
mikes . . . we're in the realm of non-text-based, physical, performance
art-type thingies. You'll know when you've been Woostered!
But Crush enters the live art arena with a freshness and welcome sense
of humour (anyone who clothes themselves in turquoise nylon flared
pant-suits, Star Trek meets Julio Iglesias, can't possibly take
themselves too seriously!) simultaneously employing and sending up some
of performance art's favourite cliches.
Some moving and acutely observed moments; the opening monologue
combines spontaneity with deliberate artifice to create a compelling
vision of human insignificance, the bitchily-insincere side of female
relationships is accurately and painfully evoked; some less successful
sections. Watch out for a reworked version opening Glasgow Tramway's new
season.

Men project their inadequacies on to big blonde Hazel Morse, simply
requiring her to wear tight shoes; laugh like a drain; listen, and offer
admiration. Men view Hazel as an uncomplaining good sport, failing to
notice Hazel's pursuit of numbing solace in whisky. Hazel, you see, is
bright enough to know her life's a mess yet she's neither bright nor
strong enough to change it.
Blowsy cyphers lacking self-knowledge are not usually the stuff of
arresting drama, but Shirley Anderson captures Dorothy Parker's
wretched, semi-autobiographical Hazel with enormous subtlety,
transforming her disposable life into an unforgettable stage experience.
Miss it at your peril.

DIVA Productions' first venture is, appropriately enough, a winning
glimpse at one of France's greatest divas, the doomed Piaf. The play,
written by Catriona and Lorna Murray, is basically a series of songs
linked by monologues in which Piaf (Lorna Murray) relates anecdotes from
her stormy professional and personal lives.
Despite the fact that the production lasts only 45 minutes, one gets a
true sense of Piaf's character -- not so much through the monologues
(although they do show her lighter side), but rather through Murray's
incredible singing.
Her singing performances are utterly entrancing. All the favourites
are there, but it's L'Accordeoniste which best reveals Piaf's powerful
yet vulnerable personality.

IN a noisy corner of a couldn't-care-less venue you'll find Chicago's
Second City bidding to sustain your faith in stage-craft. For its
Edinburgh debut the company has assembled what amounts to a scripted
greatest-sketches show with added brief demonstrations of its
world-famous improvisational skills.
Yet whatever it does, Second City's commitment to portraying character
truthfully is foremost. There are thus laughs a-plenty, but more to
savour than punchlines. Best bits? A teenage son being asked to decide
between saving his father or his mother; a charismatic serial killer;
the discussion on life in the post-Aids era sparked by an evil medical
receptionist. Go soon. The Fringe Club evidently styles itself as a
Stasi canteen, but theatre will out.

ONLY at the Edinburgh Festival with its criminal attitude to
downgrading the visual arts, could such a magnificent show of French old
master drawings be relegated to the Fringe.
For here are treasures indeed by world famous names like Poussin,
Watteau, and Degas. If you bemoan the lack of draughtsmanship in today's
art, make sure to see this and marvel! Some of these 100 sketches are to
die for: Boucher's bold Satyr, so lively he's leaping off the paper; a
delicate nude nymph from 1644 when Vouet was working on the Chateau at
Fontainebleau, Degas's portrait of his sister Therese (almost better
than Holbein), Prud'hon's spooky blindfolded head of Fortune from 1800
-- and that was before the Lottery!
All these and more belong to Antoine Prat, a lucky guy with an expert
eye for picking a winner.

THERE'S no disputing the wit, intelligence, and insight of Sondheim
and Weidman's analysis of the sense of blame and anger which lurks
behind the American Dream. You can't fail to be impressed by the sheer
cleverness and complexity with which they interweave characters,
incidents, and time-scales, neatly and humorously pointing up parallels
and correspondences.
There is, however, a danger of it becoming a slick and rather
heartless exercise, a soulless string of observations. Overall
competence and some fine performances (Richard Vergette and Diane Dubois
particularly stood out) notwithstanding, Northern Theatre Company's
production veers in this direction. A weedy synthesised accompaniment,
sterile stage set, and general lack of oomph and imagination in the
direction, added up to a whole less than the sum of its parts.

FIVE girls, one guy. A dividing line of bright red, upright tubes
between them and us. Rapid-pulse drumming on the soundscore. We watched,
they dart around in a naive crossover between playground games and
beginners Eurocrash.
It's after this that ones worst fears are realised: the tubes are part
of the act. A solitary girl disarranges them across the stage. Lifts
one, shimmies it between her hands . . . but doesn't quite go into the
full majorette-twirling routine. Thereafter the whole company will, at
some point, go into pole position.
There's a modicum of skill in this showing by Temujin Gill and
company, yes, but none of the brinkmanship, the frisson of risk,
encountered when the likes of Wim Vandekeybus play around with found
objects. Gimmicks are never a substitute for interesting moves and Skin
Deep hardly scratches the surface of real choreography.

PERRIER nominee Boothby Graffoe unveils a krazy-klown komedy kitchen
-- complete with sink, cooker and fridge -- in his show's second half.
He asks audiences not to spoil the fun by revealing too much about it,
so I'll just say that if you're prompted to chuckle by krazy-klown
knockabout komedy involving self-imploding kitchen utensils . . . well,
you've not been paying much attention to the many welcome advances in
British comedy these past 15 years.
Join KAK now: Kill All Klowns. Moreover, in the first half of his show
Boothby displays some fresh satirical insights into party-politics, thus
making it even odder and sadder that he should have abandoned an
informed comedy-present for a ropey comedy-past.

PRUDENT progamming here produced a short first half of only 30
minutes, the Lothian Region Schools Orchestra, conserving its engergy
for the symphony to come. Not to say that the two works featured early
were given scant attention. Britten's Four C Interludes were opened by
warm brass blending sweetly with bright toned strings and all sections
making good use of the orchestration's atmospheric scene painting,
conductor Colin O'Riordan pointing up some very tidy endings.
In the Debussy Rhapsody for Clarinet, soloist Pamela Turley skipped
lightly through the vituosic writing to generally gentle and sympathetic
accompaniment.
Throughout the Brahms Second Symphony there was always a powerful
forward momentum and, apart from a wee spell in the middle, textures
were clean and open, everyone finishing as strongly as they had begun.

WILLIAM Shakespeare and 10.00am clearly have a previously unrecognised
affinity.
However the Oxford Headlights coffee and croissant with tortured
Shakespeare thrown in, may leave a feeling of nausea for the rest of the
day. Shakespeare for Breakfast is pantomime without the slapstick, some
giggle in the library corner jokes and a few jibes at Kenneth Branagh,
Emma Thompson, and Woody Allen. Despite trying ever so hard to be
clever, it isn't.
The Shakespeare Workshop on the other hand is a breath of fresh air.
It offers the chance to wake up the body to a short sleep or morning
related passage, and then to meditate upon it. Taking just a few lines
out of context the words begin to speak for themselves and to live
again.
This is early morning Shakespeare to be enjoyed by all. The Oxford
Headlights might benefit.

UZ, the organisers of Streets of Glasgow, are obviously game for a
challenge. Not content with staging open-air events in mid-winter
Glasgow, this week saw their audacious attempt to take on the might of
the Edinburgh Festival with Glasgow's own mini-festival of outdoor
theatre. Such ''go for it'' attitude inevitably has its pitfalls, like
the abundance of the aerial musicians billed to perform above Buchanan
Street. But, hiccups notwithstanding, this weekend the city was animated
by an intriguing, imaginative, and above all entertaining array of
international and home-grown performance.
French company Pesce Crudo kicked off from a huge black box beamed
into Sauchiehall Street. Thick smoke seeped from its many little
flapping and chattering trap doors, the box bulging and straining with
its hidden contents. Heads, hands, limbs, and finally whole bodies
emerged. As the performance escalated towards a spectacular climax. A
bit on the long side but the attentive crowd proved that ''arty''
doesn't have to mean ''inaccessible''.
Saturday night's finale featured nine ''tribes'' of Glasgow-based
artists and performers gathered in the darkening urban waste ground of
the High Street car park to enact an anarchic, and irreverent vision of
the post-industrial city.
The Elvis Acolytes, complete with Elvis-as-Madonna icon, danced while
a portly Elvis sang to a manic techno soundtrack; the truly wonderful
Water Tribe transformed themselves into a human fountain by inserting
tubes into unspeakable parts of their anatomy; pyrotechnic outbursts
startled and disorientated; coloured light picked out the subtle beauty
of the desolate site and an awesome sound system filled the space. As we
left, music still pulsing and psychedelic projections swirling across a
giant pyramid, a couple earnestly argued about what it all meant.

Confusion reigns with DAVID BELCHER over the Perrier Award
SALTY veteran Jenny Eclair has won this year's Perrier Award, and
while I am pleased for Jenny I am also deeply confused. Why my
confusion? Because I'd always thought that the Perrier's vaguely-worded
constitution stated that it was primarily intended to be awarded to the
performer whose career would most be helped by it.
I'd always taken this to refer to young contenders whose shows weren't
selling out night after night, as Jenny's show at the Pleasance has ever
since it began its run on the night of Wednesday, August 9, three full
days before the Fringe officially started.
I'd always thought that the Perrier was meant to act as a telly
calling-card for new talent which would otherwise go overlooked by
small-screen programme-makers. So maybe I'm mistaken and Jenny wasn't
one of the stars of Packet Of Three on Channel 4 some years back. Or
perhaps this year's Perrier was awarded to Jenny as a one-off
distinguished long-service medal.
Don't get me wrong, though. I have no quarrel with Jenny Eclair, with
her scarily hilarious abilities or the undoubted comedic worth of her
current show. Indeed, if you're unable to see Jenny Eclair's Prozac And
Tantrums in Edinburgh, pray that she takes it on nationwide tour soon.
My problem is with the Perrier's ill-defined rules, rules which few
people ever see in print. By what criteria do Perrier judges reach their
decisions? Who judges the judges?

SCOTLAND'S largest business organisation has called for a major VAT
reduction on hotel accommodation, claiming such a move could help end a
prolonged period of decline within the tourism industry.
Scottish Chambers of Commerce, which has a significant number of
member companies involved in tourism, claimed a drop in VAT from 17.5%
to 8% would create 9000 new jobs.
Urging the Government to intervene to promote recovery within the
industry, Mr Peter Dunn, acting director general of SCC, which has more
than 8000 members, said the 17.5% VAT rate on tourism was higher than
most other countries and a prime reason for the UK losing out on foreign
visitors.
''Hopefully the Government will agree to address this problem, but if
it does not then the industry will be forced to tackle it from an EC
perspective.''
Mr Dunn said the Scottish Chambers of Commerce intended to increase
pressure on all parties to focus attention ''on the plight of Scottish
tourism and the urgent need for action, not words.
''Clearly the Government cannot adjust the weather but they can and
must ensure parity with other European countries in the application of
indirect taxation.''
He also called for a package of incentives to support Scottish
tourism, such as rates subsidies in off-peak periods, improved
infrastructure grants, and tourism-related training.
''This will help restore it to its rightful place in the European
market,'' said Mr Dunn, who said the chambers welcomed the establishment
of new regional tourist boards. ''We trust they will be given sufficient
financial clout to make a serious impact.''

ACTOR James Fox almost drowned yesterday after falling from and losing
his board while windsurfing at a reservoir in 30mph winds.
He was exhausted when he was pulled aboard a launch that was
patrolling the yachting championship at the Queen Mary Sailing Club, at
Ashford, west London.
Rescuer Helena Turnbull said: ''When we got to the man he was tired
out. He said he had lost his windsurfer and had been in the water for
some time. He was very cold and tired.''
Describing how she spotted Fox, she said: ''The reservoir was pretty
crowded and the winds were about Force 6. We were standing by boats
competing in the BT/Royal Yachting Association National Match Racing
championships when I saw a hand in the water and then a head.''
The 56-year-old star whose films include 60s cult classic Performance,
The Servant, and A Passage to India, told them: ''Thank God you saw
me.''
Fox, who starred in the recent TV adaptation of Joanna Trollope's The
Choir, and who lists windsurfing and tennis as his hobbies in Who's Who,
was not wearing a lifejacket. He was in the water for at least 15
minutes.
From his home in Wimbledon, south-west London last night, he said: ''I
had hired the board so I wasn't using my own gear and couldn't get
things set up properly, and I forgot to pick up a buoyancy aid, which
was stupid.''
The chairman of the Royal Yachting Association, Mr Peter Cotgrove,
said: ''I am surprised that an experienced board sailor like Mr Fox went
out without a buoyancy aid.''
Meanwhile, a windsurfer who drifted helplessly off the west coast of
Scotland for 17 hours at the weekend, and was almost given up for dead,
was yesterday criticised by the rescue service for failing to observe
elementary safety precautions.
Mr Colin Harvey, a computer programmer, from Haslingden, Lancashire,
was finally plucked from the water by an RAF rescue helicopter near
Scares rocks, 15 miles from the shore in Luce Bay, Dumfries and
Galloway.
As he recovered in Garrick Hospital, Stranraer, he said: ''For a lot
of the time it was boring. There was nothing I could do except wait for
daylight.''
But coastguard sector officer Tony Wood, of Kirkcudbright, said: ''He
did not wear a high visbility colour and he did not carry flares. He was
wearing blue and grey, and his surfboard was white. These were the same
colours as the sea.''
Mr Harvey, who is married with two sons, went windsurfing at about 2pm
on Friday -- his 44th birthday. About 30 minutes later, people at Sands
of Luce caravan park, where he was on holiday, saw he was getting into
difficulties and raised the alarm.
It was 7.20am on Saturday before he was spotted by an RAF Wessex
helicopter from Valley in Wales, winched aboard and taken to Stranraer.

LEX GOLD, director of the Confederation of British Industry in
Scotland, is leaving after just 18 months in the high-profile post.
Although Mr Gold could not be contacted for comment yesterday on his
plans, The Herald understands that letters informing CBI Scotland's
council members of his decision were sent out over the weekend. A public
announcement may be made later today.
Mr Gold, who is 54, has devoted much of his energy in his brief time
at CBI Scotland to promoting the organisation's concerns about the
future of manufacturing industry and developing its Business Agenda.
That agenda, which has spawned a series of political shopping lists,
aims to secure a more prosperous Scotland by getting other interests and
political groups to sign up for the proposition that wealth must be
created before it can be spent.
The main architects of the approach -- Mr Gold and his CBI Scotland
chairman Professor John Ward -- are now both stepping down, with that
work only partially complete. Professor Ward's two-year term in the
chair ends automatically with the CBI Scotland annual dinner early next
month.
Mr Gold, who will be leaving later in the year, is also going at a
time when his boss in London, CBI director general Howard Davies, is
moving into the deputy governor's chair at the Bank of England.
The two men, with similar backgrounds in public administration, worked
well together. There will inevitably be speculation that Mr Gold has
decided to quit because, with the departure of Mr Davies from
Centrepoint in London and Professor Ward in Scotland, he fears the
momentum of their fresh and bustling approach will stall.
The Scottish director's job has always been very poorly paid in
comparison with the CBI director general. At around #30,000 a year it
brought in barely a fifth of what Mr Davies earned.
But after a long career in the Civil Service and a shorter time as
joint number two in the fledgling Scottish Enterprise organisation, from
which he accepted a redundancy package in March, 1993, Mr Gold certainly
wasn't working for CBI Scotland for the money.
When he left Scottish Enterprise, Mr Gold said of himself: ''I am a
guy who has always liked new challenges.'' It is not clear whether he is
leaving the CBI with a fresh challenge already in place.
In his teens, Lex Gold was briefly on the playing staff of Rangers
Football Club. In the early 60s he joined the Daily Record as a trainee
sub-editor. But he quickly moved from that, joining the junior ranks of
the Civil Service through the Home Office.
After various posts in government service in London he returned to
Scotland, in 1987, as director of the Manpower Services Commission north
of the Border. The MSC turned into the Training Agency, and when the
Scottish Office announced plans to merge its work in Scotland with the
Scottish Development Agency, Lex Gold became the most senior Training
Agency staffer to join the merged body, Scottish Enterprise.
When he left Scottish Enterprise in March, 1993, he worked for a while
as a consultant, particularly in China for the chairman of
Greenock-based British Polythene Industries, Mr Cameron McLatchie, a
near neighbour in the Ayrshire coastal town of West Kilbride.
In February, 1994, Mr Gold emerged as the new director of CBI
Scotland, succeeding Mr David MacLehose. The employers' organisation had
gone through a sticky patch, and two directors, following the death of
Mr John Davidson. Its influence was on the wane.
Lex Gold and John Ward have reversed that process. Like Professor
Ward, Mr Gold is an articulate and polished media performer. It remains
to be seen whether their going will leave CBI Scotland in the shade once
more.

PRINCE Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones yesterday braved the Balmoral
elements to attend morning service.
Ms Rhys-Jones, dressed in a lilac outfit, accompanied the prince and
other members of the royal family to Crathie Kirk, their traditional
place of worship during their Deeside holidays.
Despite the pouring rain, yesterday's royal attendance was the biggest
at Crathie for several years.
Speculation had been rife that the large family gathering would result
in an engagement announcement.
But a Buckingham Palace spokesman made it clear that no engagement was
imminent and Ms Rhys-Jones was not included in yesterday's official
royal photo-shoot.
Hundreds of well-wishers turned out to cheer as the royals drove the
short distance from the castle to the small hilltop church.
The prince and Ms Rhys-Jones travelled in a Range Rover along with the
Princess Royal, her husband Captain Tim Laurence, and her son Peter
Phillips.
A total of 12 senior royal members attended church yesterday -- the
biggest attendance since the Princess Royal's wedding there in 1992.
Prince Charles and his younger son Harry accompanied the 95-year-old
Queen Mother in the first car.
They were followed by the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince William and
Zara Phillips.
Earlier an official royal photograph was taken inside Balmoral Castle
by local wedding photographer Logan Sangster.
The picture, taken annually, is used on postcards which are put on
sale at local shops.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has made it plain in an interview
with The Herald that he is prepared to see the prison population grow as
the result of a harder-edged approach to law and order.
The clear message he is sending to the courts is that neither the
level of imprisonment nor the length of sentences should be constrained
by the amount of prison space available.
It is also highly likely that Mr Forsyth will introduce random
mandatory drug testing in Scottish jails, following the English example,
to deal with the growing scandal of the availability of illegal drugs to
prisoners. He seems certain to announce this at Shotts Prison on
Thursday when he sets out his law and order stall.
Mr Forsyth gives the clearest possible support to the building,
financing, and running of new prisons in Scotland by the private sector
as the way forward, and the sooner the better.
He indicates that his experience at the Home Office as English Prisons
Minister has convinced him that the private sector can produce prison
spaces quicker, more cheaply, and in jails that are easier to manage and
run.
His message, however, is not all hard line.
He told The Herald he wants to see, as soon as possible, research in
Scotland into levels and causes of recidivism and research to establish
which regimes work best in preventing reoffending. More than 80% of
Scottish prisoners leaving the jails return.
He also indicated he was aware of public disquiet over apparently
inconsistent and inappropriate sentencing, another political hot potato
given the renowned independence of the Scottish judiciary.
He may also revisit the current levels of remission for prisoners,
many of whom are now released at half sentence, because of what he sees
as the same strand of public disquiet.
Mr Forsyth reassured prison staff he will not be reopening the fraught
area of market testing of either individual functions in the jails or of
entire prisons to allow tendering by private service or security
companies, but adds the rider so long as the Scottish Prison Service
agency continues to deliver efficiency and value for money.
That will come as a considerable relief to everyone in the Scottish
criminal justice system, throughout which there have been widespread
fears that the new Scottish Secretary, imbued with Home Office dogma,
might import Mr Howard's excesses and upset the equilibrium which was
achieved by Mr Lang and Lord Fraser.
On the broader law and order front, Mr Forsyth was full of praise for
the initiatives of Mr Leslie Sharp, Chief Constable of Strathclyde,
particularly his latest drive first to educate and then to attack the
drugs culture in the west of Scotland.

Paris,
RUGBY Union will become a professional game once the amateurism
regulations are repealed at a meeting of the International Board council
in Tokyo next month.
The momentous decision was announced here yesterday after a special
three-day meeting of representatives from 12 of the 67-nation membership
of the board.
The decision, taken against a backdrop of unprecedented commercial
activity in the game, came as the result of a wide-ranging working party
investigation into abuses of the amateurism laws worldwide.
The four-man working party, which included Mr Freddie McLeod of the
Scottish Rugby Union, decided that abuses were so widespread that the
status quo was no longer tenable.
The working party reported to a meeting of the Board in March, but a
final decision had been deferred until this weekend. Yesterday, Mr
Vernon Pugh QC, chairman of the Amateurism Working Party, outlined how
the new professional structure of the game will evolve:
* A revised set of regulations to be known as Participation in the
Game Regulations will be put in place following the interim meeting of
the IB Council next month.
* The regulations relating to amateurism should then be repealed.
* Subsequent to repeal of the amateur regulations, rugby will become
an open game and there will be prohibition on payment or the provision
of other material benefit to any person involved in the game.
* Payment may be made at any level of participation.
* There will be no pay ceiling.
* Payment for results will not be prohibited, meaning that win bonuses
are sanctioned.
* The regulations will be permissive in nature and not mandatory. Any
union may put in place domestic regulations which can be more
restrictive.
Yesterday's announcement, which sweeps aside more than a century of
tradition had been widely canvassed but the scale of what amounts to a
revolution in the game still took many observers by surprise.
Mr Bernard Lapasset, chairman of the International Rugby Football
Board, said: ''This is a momentous day for rugby to recognise that the
constraints of the modern game do not permit full maintenance of the
amateur principles.
''The working party is to be congratulated on bringing rugby to these
historic decisions which will enable the game to continue its
spectacular growth in popularity.''
Working party chairman Mr Pugh added: ''We are entering a very
different world. The game will change for all concerned including
players and administrators alike.
''The challenge is to retain the special character which has helped
make rugby so popular. The decision of the council is an extremely
positive and bold one,'' he added.
Mr McLeod, who attended the Paris meeting with the SRU's other IB
representative, the former international referee Mr Allan Hosie said
yesterday: ''We will go back to Scotland and consider all of the
implications, based in the light of the submission which we made to the
amateurism working party and to the council this weekend.
''Allan Hosie and myself will be briefing the SRU committee tonight
and there will be a press conference tomorrow at Murrayfield.
''I think anybody who heard our press conference two weeks ago will
appreciate that there is general satisfaction to the outcome of these
Paris talks.''
A fortnight ago, alone of the home unions, the SRU announced that it
was ready to embrace professionalism with Scottish internationalists
being placed under contract to the Union and payments made along the
lines of what the union could afford.
It emerged in Paris yesterday that some unions will pay international
players directly but The Herald understands that, in line with its
submission to the IB, the SRU still prefers payment to be routed through
a properly audited trust fund.
When Rugby Union becomes an open game next month there is still some
doubt as to its relationship with Rugby League.
Currently, there is no legitimate two-way traffic between the two
codes, union players who have gone to league having to serve a
three-year cooling off period before they are readmitted to union ranks.
Yesterday, Mr Pugh said the position relating to admission or
reinstatement of Rugby League players to the union game would be
determined at next month's Tokyo meeting.
However, when asked what the difference now was between the two codes,
Mr Pugh replied: ''There are 15 players in union and 13 in league. There
are line outs in one and not the other. The games will remain different
in their nature, but other than that I expect there will be very little
difference between the two codes.''
The great irony of yesterday's announcement lies in that it is exactly
100 years since the two codes went their separate ways after the cash
row over broken-time payments.
Mr Pugh said that even with so much tradition at stake it had not been
a sad day for union but there remained a level of concern that the game
should not change fundamentally as to its nature.
''However, any sense of sadness is overtaken by the fact that today's
decision was, perhaps, inevitable'' he said.
The fact new regulations are permissive and not ''mandatory'' and that
individual unions have been awarded the right to draft domestic
regulations, which can be more restrictive gives, some indication of the
passion of the debate which raged in Paris this week.

<HEADLINE>Reynolds's plan on delaying surrender of weapons in Ulster rejected. Appeal fails to break gun barrier</HEADLINE>

THE Government last night rejected fresh proposals on the arms issue
aimed at breaking the deadlock in the Ulster peace process.
Former Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds had urged the Government
to drop its demand that the IRA must start handing over its guns and
explosives before Sinn Fein could take part in all-party talks.
He said that, instead, the decommissioning of weapons should be made a
precondition of any final peace settlement.
A Downing Steet spokesman insisted that there had to be an agreement
on decommissioning and on methods of carrying it out before political
talks began.
The Northern Ireland Office, in a firmly-worded statement, also made
clear such a solution would not be acceptable and that there could be no
talks until the IRA began to surrender its arms.
Mr Reynolds said this British priority ''will never work''. He called
on the British Government to change its preconditions to move the peace
process -- which celebrates its first anniversary this week -- further
forward.
He is thought to be publicly voicing the wishes of the Irish
Government, which denied it wanted the summit between Mr Major and Irish
Prime Minister John Bruton, provisionally pencilled in for September 6,
cancelled.
A joint working party of British and Irish officials are thought to be
having difficulty coming up with proposals for decommissioning to which
both Prime Ministers could put their names at the summit.
Some form of international supervision seems to have been agreed but
the British are insisting the IRA must pledge never to return to
violence before any political discussion begins.
Irish Government sources said there was ''a wide gap'' between
themselves and Britain on how and when decommissioning should begin.
The IRA is expected to make a statement on decommissioning later this
week to mark the peace anniversary. It could go so far as agreeing to
co-operate with a decommissioning process monitored by outside
countries. But it will not accept handing over weapons until a political
settlement has been reached.
Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, joined Mr Reynolds in suggesting that
it was unrealistic to expect the IRA to surrender weapons in advance of
political talks. He said: ''If they were playing the games they are said
to be they would walk in and hand over guns on Monday, and on Tuesday
buy some more.''
The Downing Street spokesman refused to comment on American press
reports claiming that President Bill Clinton believes talks could
include the question of decommissioning and did not need to be preceded
by an agreement on surrendering weapons.
The spokesman pointed out that it was not simply the British
Government's position that blocked IRA and Sinn Fein entry to all party
talks. The Unionist parties had made clear, he said, that they would not
take part unless there was an agreement on giving up guns and
explosives.
This was reinforced by Ulster Unionist spokesman Mr David Trimble, MP
for Upper Bann, who said there was no question of his party meeting with
Sinn Fein and the IRA as long as they reserved to themselves the
possibility of a return to future violence.
Mr Trimble accused Mr Reynolds of backtracking on the principles of
the Downing Street Declaration which he signed with Mr Major.
The Government's outright rejection of Mr Reynolds's proposals is
likely to intensify the irritation felt in Irish Government circles with
what is seen as British foot-dragging.
The timing of the weekend announcement that the September 6 summit
could be delayed, just a day after Northern Ireland Secretary Sir
Patrick Mayhew said he hoped they would go ahead as planned, was a clear
sign of Irish frustration.
In an interview with GMTV's Sunday programme, Mr Reynolds said:
''Handing in guns is symbolic surrender. In this situation after 25
years we did not have any victors and we did not have any defeats either
and I think one has to recognise that,
''That's the basic reason that the paramilitaries are saying 'no
surrender', because they don't want to be treated as having
surrendered.''
Later he again rejected Britain's insistence that the decommissioning
issue had to be resolved before discussions could begin.
He warned: ''There is a psychology of surrender coming into this that
is threatening to poison the peace process.''
Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said this approach was
consistent with their own thinking and stressed that there would be no
decommissioning ahead of all-party talks.
''Lets deal with the realities. The IRA are not going to hand over
their weapons to anybody until there is a new political arrangement,''
he said in a BBC Radio Scotland interview.
It now remains to be seen whether officials in London and Dublin can
agree a package of measures in time for the summit.

JOHN MAJOR won a prize yesterday for being ''one of the four main
architects of peace'' in Northern Ireland. But he was not in the small
County Mayo village of Killala to receive the award, made jointly to
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, former Irish Premier Albert Reynolds, and
Ulster politician John Hume. Instead officials of the Humbert Summer
School handed the prize, glazed plate, to a senior British diplomat.
A crowd of about 400 watched the presentation ceremony before a
discussion on the peace process involving Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds, Mr
Hume, and others.
The 20-in plates were inscribed with each of the men's names,
prompting Mr Adams to remark: ''We now seem to have round plate talks.''
He said he wanted the Premier ''round a table'', not on a plate.

* Twelve police officers were injured during violent clashes between
rival crowds in Northern Ireland. Up to 20 civilians were also reported
to have been hurt, some when the RUC opened fire with plastic bullets
during the street fighting in Castlederg, County Tyrone.
Rival Roman Catholic and Protestant factions fought after the assault
of a man and woman. Two groups of around 100 strong gathered and police
reinforcements were sent in to separate them.
Local doctor Brendan O'Hare, who spent much of the night treating the
injured, said the clashes were the worst seen in the town in years.
''Tribalism is the only way I can describe it,'' he said.

THE world's first offshore wave-power station, the Osprey 1 was said
to be a ''write-off'' last night after it keeled over partially
submerged in a storm.
The #4m Clyde-built structure was caught by the tail-end of Hurricane
Felix and was slewed round and partly sunk in the sea 300-yards off
Dounreay, Caithness, yesterday afternoon.
The local laird, Mr Geoffrey Minter, whose Sandside House is only one
mile from the 75ft-high wave-power station, said last night that the
structure had almost completely disappeared under the waves.
Earlier in the day he said that only a third of the structure that is
supposed to be above the waterline was still showing. ''That is now
leaning over at a 45-degree angle, instead of being vertical as it
should be''.
Powerful Atlantic waves lashed against the already-damaged body of
Osprey, which was launched amid considerable publicity early this month
from the UIE yard at Clydebank.
Late last week, and before this major setback caused by the weekend's
storm, the innovative turbines were removed as a precaution from Osprey,
an acronym for Ocean Swell Powered Renewable Energy.
Then holes were found above the waterline and cracks were seen on
steel welds below the surface, while some metal panels came loose and
fell into the sea.
This was despite the fact that the Pentland Firth area had enjoyed the
calmest seas for years, as the North of Scotland basked in this summer's
heatwave.
Towards the end of last week insurance loss-adjusters were called in
by the designers and owners of the ''green energy'' Osprey concept,
Applied Research and Technology of Seafield Road, Longman Industrial
Estate, Inverness.
Last night Mr Allan Thomson, managing director of ART, confirmed that
the damaged Osprey was likely to be a ''write-off''. He said that the
damage was so severe that the unique power-machine would probably have
to be scrapped.
Mr Thomson said that the damage to the ballast tanks suffered during
the installation of the prototype Osprey 1 had ''now progressed to the
stage where repair is unlikely to be viable''. He said: ''Obviously this
is a disappointment for us''.
Mr Minter, who chairs Scrabster Harbour Trustees said: ''It does seem
such a shame. The waves were quite rough over the weekend, but nothing
unusual for this part of the world.''
Late last week, experts working for ART were examining ways of
removing Osprey to a sheltered location -- probably Loch Eriboll, the
deepwater former Naval Wartime anchorage near Cape Wrath, Sutherland --
to allow repairs to take place.
The European Union invested #500,000 in the venture, while Inverness
and Nairn Enterprise company contributed a grant of #350,000.
Several big name private sector companies also made contributions, and
the device was put into the sea off Dounreay, not only to ''harvest''
the power of waves which make the north coast of Caithness popular with
surfers, but also to tap into the National Grid.
Osprey was designed to push air, forced up and down by the movement of
the waves and compressed by the shape of the structure, through patented
electricity-generating turbines designed by wave-power expert Professor
Allan Wells, formerly of Queen's University, Belfast.
Mr Thomson said that identifying and solving problems was a function
of development engineers and added: ''It is at times like this that you
realise that your insurance premiums were well spent''. The machine was
insured on Lloyd's London Marine Market.
Mr Thomson also confirmed that ART intends to build a second Osprey as
soon as possible, which could be ready in six-months' time and be in the
water by next spring.
