IT HAS been called the toughest hole in golf, and for this year's Open
it will be even tougher.
The seventeenth at St Andrews is 461 yards of torture for anyone of a
nervous disposition, a card-wrecker if ever there was one.
Now the Royal and Ancient Club have decided that the railway sheds,
the hotel, the out-of-bounds, the road, the path, the wall and the
cavernous Road Bunker -- the one which Nick Price calls ''The Pit of
Death'' -- deserve some help.
So they have allowed the rough to grow beyond the green, preventing
anyone who goes long from putting back up the bank, and are also putting
a giant scoreboard in the way for anyone tempted to fire his approach
left of the green -- a route many have tried to take in the past in
order to bypass potential disaster.
Quite right, too. It did work. After all, there were no fewer than 11
birdies during the 1984 championship and 15 in 1990. But collectively,
the players were 355 over par 11 years ago and 250 over five years ago.
The hole has claimed some famous scalps over the years.
In 1978, Japan's Tommy Nakajima -- who in the US Masters only three
months earlier had had a 13 on the thirteenth hole -- was a relieved man
after having avoided the sheds, hotel, and out-of-bounds with his drive,
and then the road, the path, the wall, and the bunker with his second
shot. But even on the green, he was not safe yet.
Putting for birdie, however, his ball caught a slope and curled off
into the bunker. Four shots later he finally got back on the green and
two putts later he had a 9. The Road Bunker instantly had another name
-- the Sands of Nakajima.
In the same Open, Seve Ballesteros was sharing the lead in the second
round when he drove out of bounds and took 7.
Back at the course six years later, Ballesteros bogeyed it in the
first three rounds, but then finally made a par en route to victory, and
behind him Tom Watson, tied for the lead, hit a No.2-iron up against the
wall, took 5 and lost the chance of a record-equalling sixth triumph.
In 1990 Scott Hoch ran up a 9, going out of bounds and then from rough
to bunker to three putts. Fellow American Peter Jacobsen's four scores
during the week were 6, 3 (thanks to a monster putt), 5, and 8.
Who will fall victim this time? It will be fun watching, if not fun
playing.

MELBOURNE CUP
DOUBLE Trigger was yesterday installed 14-1 favourite for the
Melbourne Cup, the spearhead of a challenge his ambitious trainer, Mark
Johnston, hopes to expand to other big races on the card.
The Ascot Gold Cup winner is on target to match Ireland's Vintage
Crop, ground-breaking winner two years ago, by lifting the #943,000 race
on November 7.
But his Middleham handler has also earmarked four other horses for the
supporting races in sprinters Double Blue, Double Quick, and Branston
Abby plus Celestial Key.
Interest in the highlight of the Australian race season has snowballed
so much that up to 18 nominations are expected from Britain and Ireland,
including Godolphin's Red Bishop, Northumberland Plate winner Bold Gait,
and Chester Cup hero Top Cees.

<HEADLINE>Feeling champion at the Home of Golf.  Price and Pavin bid to join an exclusive club</HEADLINE>

NICK Price, the holder, and Corey Pavin, the US Open champion, are
aiming to emulate Tom Watson as they approach their final preparations
for the Open Championship, which begins tomorrow at St Andrews. Should
either succeed, they could become members of an exclusive club.
In 1983 Watson was the last player successfully to defend this title,
having the previous year become the last to win both the US Open and
this championship in the same summer. Whether or not their games or
their frames of mind are capable of achieving either feat will emerge
over the next four days.
Until recent weeks, when he has finished between ninth and thirteenth
in five out of six tournaments, Price had had a spotty season.
Distractions were inevitable after he had won six times last year --
adding the US PGA title to this Open made for ''a period I will never
forget how well I played'' -- and also damaging.
''You have to learn how to manage your time and not over-extend
yourself,'' Price observed. ''Jack Nicklaus is the prime example of
being able to organise his various outside activites to accommodate
practice and competition. It's why he has lasted as long as he has.
''I'm still not playing quite as well as at this time last year,''
Price continued. ''But if it doesn't happen this week, it soon will.''
The Zimbabwean, now 38, first played on the Old Course 20 years ago in
the qualifying competition for that Open -- won at Carnoustie by,
needless to say, Watson.
Price added: ''I've played the course well, but not well enough ever
to be in contention. On these huge greens you frequently have first
putts of between 25 and 30 feet and if you are not putting well from
that distance you're constantly left to hole out from three or four
feet.''
Then Priced admitted that after the 1990 Open he was so frustrated
with his putting that in cold blood as it were, four hours after the
final round, he broke the offending club in pieces and consigned them to
a rubbish bag. If his 'The Fat Lady Sings' model fails to oblige this
time, will a fate worse even than death befall her?
At all events, Price is anxious that the 6933-yard Links gains some
defence from a stiff breeze.
''A winning total of 10 or 12 under would be acceptable,'' he
commented. ''Not 18 under par, the figure with which Nick Faldo won five
years ago.''
Then he offered a morsel of advice to Alex Dickie, responsible for the
pin positions. The Glasgow businessman was urged to consider ''a variety
of placements and use parts of some greens that haven't been discovered
yet.''
Perhaps Walter Woods, the Links supervisor who retires at the end of
December after 21 years, will look out his map and compass and see what
devilment can be arranged.
Apart from avoiding the bunkers at all costs -- in 1990 Faldo's only
visit to one was from the fourth tee in the final round -- Price
believes that he must be ''specific'' in his strategy. In other words,
on a Links which more than most lacks definition, Price is looking for
definite guidelines towards which to aim his shots.
Respect, and indeed affection, for the mother of all courses enthuses
Pavin's opinions. He first played it in Seve Ballesteros's Open in 1984,
when he was exempt and although he had to qualify six years later Pavin
had enjoyed his baptism so much that he returned. He then survived a
play-off in the preliminary competition at Leven. Pavin, since Paul
Azinger's victory in the 1993 US PGA championship burdened with the
description of ''the best American not to have won a major'', believed
his best chance would come either in the Masters or the Open.
Instead he won the championship in which he had his worst record, for
he just ''never got anything going in terms of winning.''
Now, just as Price has had to do, Pavin is learning ''not to get
caught up with the US Open victory.''
To that end Pavin has brought with him a sports psychologist, Dick
Coop, who has worked with him since 1990 and with, among others, Payne
Stewart and Jim Gallagher, both also winners this season.

OUR man is in good shape. Scotland's best hope of winning the Open at
golf's high altar, Colin Montgomerie, has put behind him the relative
disappointment of last week and is clearly in confident mood once again.
The leader of the European order of merit for the past two years,
Monty has played remarkably good and consistent golf for almost 12
months, but has not won since he lifted the German Open last August. His
third place in the Scottish Open at Carnoustie last week was his
twentieth top-10 placing in the 32 tournaments since his last victory, a
phenomenally consistent run, but one which has made him all the more
committed to getting his name at the very top of the leaderboard this
week.
''I suppose it could be counted as disappointing, finishing third last
week, but I come into this Open playing better from tee to green than at
any time before and for that reason my expectations are higher than they
have been before.''
Monty's only problem has been his putting, which lost him first place
at Carnoustie and at the Murphy's Irish Open the week before, but he is
hopeful he has discovered the flaw that was preventing him getting his
fair share of single putts.
''I was decelerating into the ball and now I am accelerating again,''
he said, adding with a wry smile, ''I found, as you do, that if I hit
the ball short it never goes in.'' Now, whatever else, he is being
positive about his stroke after help from fellow pro Ian Woosnam and his
coach, Bill Ferguson. ''Now I am missing positively, rather than
negatively,'' said the man who is as capable of the subtle quip as the
rude explosion.
He admits that for a Scot the Open at St Andrews does bring extra
pressure, but does not believe it will bother him. ''I have never
performed badly under pressure and it seems to bring the best out in me
. . . I look forward to it.''
That would seem to be supported by statistics. Playing on the European
Tour, Montgomerie has been seven times in the top 10 in the last 10
competitions. ''My worst is twentieth and that is all very encouraging.
I am in consistent mode and I hope I can keep it up.
''I believe a win is around the corner. It might be this week or next,
but it will happen. If I can hole a few putts it could be this week.''
He hopes for what he calls a ''testing breeze,'' which would make for
a more demanding championship. ''If the wind blows you can find yourself
in areas where you can't get up and down. If the course is like today
the par would have to be a 69.''
Perhaps, not surprisingly, Monty anticipates a good showing from Nick
Faldo, his Ryder Cup partner. ''He was superb last week at Carnoustie
after, I believe, taking three weeks off. He said he wanted to feel the
thrill of pressure again and he did that.''
Perhaps, less predictably, Monty named Greg Norman as the man most
likely to succeed. ''He is the one everybody has to beat.''
The Scots who are already turning up in good numbers at the Old
Course, would like to think Monty would be the one they are trying to
catch on Sunday. It would not be overdue if he did win his first major.
Eighth in the Sony world rankings, Montgomerie knows that the seven
ahead of him have all won major titles. His turn has to come soon.
Tiger Woods, on the other hand, has no right to expect anything of
that order for a while yet. The American amateur champion, maybe the
most touted US player at that level since Jack Nicklaus, would be doing
well to see out the four days on his first visit to the Old Course. He
may be in for a rude awakening if the wind blows, however.
''I got a feel for the true links type of golf at Carnoustie last week
and I expected it to be same conditions here, very hard and very firm,
but this is more like the American game,'' said Woods. ''You can fly the
ball and the greens are holding very well.''
There have been a few of this pleasant young man's predecessors who
have gathered such an impression on calm days like yesterday, but soon
after have run home to Uncle Sam's bosom shouting ''foul''.
But, whatever else, Woods does fully appreciate the setting. ''The
history of this place is just phenomenal and it is truly an honour to
play where the game started.''
He will rely heavily on veteran caddy Bruce Sorley . . . ''he knows
the course as good as anyone,'' said Woods, who belies his slim build
with prodigious hitting. He drove the eighteenth green on Monday, but
admitted that with the breeze blowing differently he had no chance
yesterday.
He has interesting first impressions of the Road Hole, the
seventeenth. ''It is a weird hole, because you never see the fairway off
the tee. The further you hit the ball the worse it becomes.''
He is not having a bet with our own star amateur, Gordon Sherry -- ''I
just wish him luck.'' This may be good sense, as he lost #1 to our man
at the Scottish Open last week. Seems to me like Tiger will be a very
rich man some day.

DORSET golfer Martyn Thompson thinks he may be creating golfing
history this week. Three months after having been a caddie in the US
Masters, he is playing in the Open.
The 25-year-old assistant pro carried the bag of his friend Lee James,
British amateur champion at the time, at Augusta, but now after a
remarkable 10 days he lines up against the world's top players himself.
''I've witnessed the atmosphere of a major championship and to
experience it again as a player is something I can't wait for,'' he
said.
Thompson shot a 71 in regional qualifying at North Hants last week,
holing a 12-foot putt on the final green to avoid a play-off. He then
scored 66-70 in final qualifying at Leven Links and earned his place
after a play-off.
* LEADING qualifer Joe Hughes, of Cardross, reached the last four of
the Helensburgh Boys' Tournament yesterday and will now meet Robert
Lynden of Paisley on Friday. Results:
J Hughes (Cardoss) beat L Riddle (Baberton), 1 hole; R Lynden
(Paisley) beat G Bell (Cathcart Castle), 1 hole; J McMahon (Cardross)
beat J Sharp (Cowal), 3 and 1; G Ewart (Eastwood) beat J Paterson
(Ladhope), 1 hole.
* IAN Muir, of Downfield, headed the qualifiers for the Shotts
Assistants Centenary Pro-Am yesterday with a round of 67. Leading
scores:
67 -- I Muir (Downfield). 68 -- D Drysdale (Dunbar). 69 -- P Wardell
(Longniddry). 70 -- S Kennedy (Pitreavie), C Newgent (Tulliallan).

WE were a lucky generation -- we had school sport. At my place of
education there were fielded, every winter week, at least 20 rugby
teams, considerably more if you counted those from the primary
department which operated in a different part of Edinburgh.
In the summer, the number of cricket teams was only slightly less and,
if one disliked the sounds of leather on willow, you could run for the
school or compete for a place in the golf side.
Sport was taken very seriously. The day the names went up on the
notice-board you could be bowled over in the rush to see who had been
picked. And we had a long roll of honour, boys who had gone on to
represent their country -- Colin Telfer and Pringle Fisher were at
school during my period, winger Iwan Tukalo was the latest Royal High
boy to put on the blue shirt.
In retrospect that roll should really have contained the names of the
teachers who literally gave so freely of their time and efforts. Our
first serious rugby coach was the music master, but almost every member
of staff was involved in one activity or an other.
A few years ago I bumped into the then headmaster of my old school.
''We will not be putting out a first fifteen this year,'' he told me,
''we just can't find enough players or coaches.'' I found that a
shocking statement.
Happily, matters have improved at that particular location, but it is
still, sadly, true that many children go through their entire school
life without ever having the opportunity to don the sporting colours.
That is completely unacceptable.
Yes, of course, I welcome the Prime Minister's initiative to put team
sport back in the curriculum. The last 15 years have seen a steady
decline and I hope Mr Major has the will to see this project through.
So if Mr Major's revolution is to work it has to start in the teacher
training colleges. And the Government will have to come up with cash,
and not just from the National Lottery, to back up their admirable
intentions.
That goes for local authorities as well. Many of them have given
planning permission for building on what was previously prime playing
field land. This cannot be allowed to continue.
I am shocked when I look around my own city and see how much land has
been lost. Let's have a statement of intent to build a ring fence around
what remains.
Education officials have also, wittingly or not, given the impression
that team sport came very near the bottom in the list of priorities.
There were always better ways to spend the available cash.
Nor has their been much public encouragement for those who have tried
to help. I know of two fathers who offered to start a school football
team and were none too politely told to mind their own business.
Here is an idea for starters. How about a prize, a tangible reward,
maybe even some cash, to the school which is judged to have made most
progress towards the development of team sport in the next academic
year? Maybe some enterprising company might like to chuck in a bit of
sponsorship.
If you like that notion, why not drop a line to your local councillor
or education department. I might even put in a motion along similar
lines myself to the new Edinburgh City authority.
An Academy of Sport will be a great benefit to the particularly
gifted, a further aid to the special ones. I also want to cater,
however, for the kids who are never going to be superstars but can gain
years of pleasure by being part of a team.
Sport is an important component in the development of most children.
The discipline which team games impose, the realisation of the need to
be helped by others, the pride in achievement, the friendships made are
all important steps in the learning process.
If your child is missing out, maybe it is time you asked why.

SCOTLAND'S top two juniors, Colin Hamilton and Neil Dickson, have both
been seeded in this weekend's Dutch Open at the Dekker Club in
Zoetermeer.
Hamilton, the Scottish junior champion, is ranked to reach the
quarter-finals, while Dickson is in the 9/16 bracket. The top seed is
last season's Scottish Junior Open under-16 champion, Egypt's Ahmed
Faizy.
In their last year in the junior ranks, the Scots have decided to have
a final fling on the European junior circuit. The Dutch event is the
final of a three-week run of events -- France and Germany were the
previous halts.
As part of a new programme, it has already been decided that a
Scottish team will be sent to all three events next season. In addition,
teams will also compete in tournaments south of the Border.
Southport-based Hamilton, meanwhile, is heading north next season, and
will be joining Dickson at Glasgow University.

MICHAEL Kinane was yesterday rueing a three-day riding ban that has
ruled him out of three of the most lucrative days of the Glorious
Goodwood meeting.
The Irish big-race specialist joined Pat Eddery, who misses the whole
of the meeting, on the list of celebrated absentees when stewards at
Killarney suspended him for excessive use of the whip on Monday night.
Among the top races Kinane will now miss between next Wednesday and
Friday are the Sussex Stakes, Richmond Stakes, Schweppes Golden Mile,
Goodwood Cup, and Molecomb Stakes.
The Irishman, who has ridden just one previous winner at the Goodwood
fixture, would have been in great demand, not least for his chief
employer Sheikh Mohammed.
Charnwood Forest, who featured in a York double for Kinane last
Friday, was a possible mount in the Sussex Stakes while Henry Cecil also
hoped to use him for some of his two-year-old runners.
Guy Harwood will be a seeking a new partner for Royal Hunt Cup winner
Realities, who was due to be Kinane's mount in the Schweppes Golden
Mile.
The recent spate of suspensions ruled many jockeys out of at least
part of the five-day festival.
On the opening day, next Tuesday, no fewer than 10 riders will be
absent having committed riding offences.
Kinane will be riding at Ascot this Saturday where he is due to
partner Blue Duster in the Princess Margaret Stakes and Red Bishop, if
the Godolphin colt gets the go-ahead to run in the King George VI and
Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes.
Meanwhile, Ray Cochrane is to appear before the Jockey Club
disciplinary committee at Portman Square this morning concerning his
riding of Bedside Mail at Sandown on July 7.
The jockey was found to have been guilty of careless riding in the
HSBC Cup and the Sandown stewards referred his case to Portman Square as
it was his third such offence this season.
* PYRAMUS looks a solid wager to complete a hat trick in the CSS SDN
BHD Handicap today at Catterick.
Despite winning his last two starts, Susan Piggott's colt has managed
to escape the attentions of the handicapper.
He produced improved form to win a Goodwood handicap by a neck from
Chickawicka -- a winner since -- last month.
And he showed that was no fluke with a subsequent smooth success in a
conditions race over today's course and distance, beating Greatest three
lengths with the minimum of fuss.
Piggott immediately penned in today's contest as Pyramus' next target
and, despite the fact that he appears to be progressing well, is only on
a 2lb higher mark than at Goodwood.
He will be partnered by regular pilot Gary Milligan, who has been seen
to good effect several times and is a name to note for the future.

GEORGE Salmond takes charge of the national side against England
amateurs in Belfast today, with the affable Arbroath batsman replacing
Alastair Storie for the defence of a Triple Crown Trophy won in
thrilling style against today's opponents at Hamilton Crescent last
year.
Ironically, the ex-skipper stroked a majestic century to set up that
triumph, and Salmond will spare a thought for his predecessor.
He admitted: ''I can't help feeling sorry for Ally. When I was left
out of the B&amp;H team earlier in the season, Ally told me to stick in and
things would come right for me. I had no idea it would be at his
expense.''
Salmond has a well-balanced side around him, with the old firm of Iain
Philip and Bruce Patterson likely to be re-united as openers.

IF none of the main challengers for the 124th Open could be literally
termed hungry, there are one or two with consuming desires to succeed
here this week who might be hard to contain.
Bernhard Langer, the German, unquestionably is one. Any man who can
beat the yips -- a dreaded golfing disease which renders the victim
incapable of holing any putt under six feet -- three times has to be
made of stern stuff, and when you add Langer's natural brilliance he has
to be a prototype for Open glory.
Winner of the US Masters twice, Langer came close to winning this
title on the Old Course in 1984, finishing joint second to Seve
Ballesteros.
''I outplayed him but he holed some putts and I didn't,'' he recalled,
''but I am really looking forward to this week. I have been playing well
for almost six to eight weeks, winning twice. I took time off last week
to rest and be with my family. I hardly played golf at all, but now I am
fresh and eager to get sarted.''
Like most seasoned pros, he relishes the return to the Old Course.
Yet, when he first played it he admits he did not like it. ''That was in
in 1978. I didn't know where to go with all the bunkers. But the more I
played it the more I grew to love it.
''You need to know the angles and different possibilities. It is
unique.''

ROBERT Clark of Yoker almost pulled off a surprise victory at
Inveraray Highland Games yesterday, when at a body weight of only 9st
7lb he fought his way into the final of the 13st 7lb Scottish
championship.
After less than a minute he was ahead by two falls to nothing, but
opponent Brian Long used all his superior weight and strength to pull
back two falls. A Flying Hank followed and Clark was convinced he had
won, but it was judged dog fall, then the new champion managed a simple
twist to win the title.
11st 7lb -- 1, R Clark (Yoker); 2, C Le Du (Brittany); 3, E Olivier
(Brittany). 13st 7lb (Scottish championship) -- 1, B Long (Alba JC); 2,
R Clark (Yoker); 3, G Neilson (Blantyre). Heavyweight -- 1, R McNamara

SCOTTISH sprint champion Ross Baillie recorded two wins and led the
Scottish Schools 4 x 100m sprint relay team to victory in yesterday's
TSB under-20 international match at Dam Park Stadium, Ayr.
Baillie, who will run for the British team at the European Junior
championships at the end of this month in Hungary, won the 200 metres in
21.7sec into a strong headwind and also displayed immaculate style in
the 110m hurdles for victory in 14.8.
Scott Fraser (11.3) and Gillian Hegney (12.4) won the 100m sprints for
the Schools team while Alasdair Donaldson improved on his personal best
by two seconds when winning the 1500m in 3-56.0 with a speedy finish
that was confirmed when he anchored the 4 x 400m team to victory in
3-18.3. Match results:
Men -- 1, Scotland 187 points; 2, Welsh Schools 168[1/2]; 3, Scottish
Schools 164; 4, Wales 111[1/2]. Women -- 1, Scottish Schools 154; 2,
Scotland 151; 3, Wales 108; 4, Welsh Schools 91. Overall -- 1, Scotland
338; 2, Scottish Schools 318; 3, Welsh Schools 259[1/2]; 4, Wales
219[1/2].
* COLIN Donnelly, of Cambuslang, leads the Scotland squad for the
Snowdon international hill race on Saturday. Team:
Men -- Colin Donnelly (Cambuslang), Peter Dymoke (Livingston), John
Hepburn (Lochaber), Ian Murphy (Clydesdale). Women -- Sonia Armitage
(Aberdeen), Anne-Marie Hughes (Shettleston), Penny Rother (Livingston),
Elspeth Scott (Westerlands).
* LINFORD Christie will spar with one of his main rivals for the world
100 metres title next month in the BUPA International at Sheffield on
Sunday.
He faces Canadian Donovan Bailey in a 150m event. Bailey's 9.91sec in
the weekend's Canadian trials was the world's fastest 100m this year.

THE Tynecastle feud which has been simmering during the summer boiled
over yesterday when Hearts announced that they were ready to buy out
manager Tommy McLean's contract.
A statement issued by chairman Chris Robinson insisted that an offer
had been made to the manager to end the problems which had dogged the
relationship between him and the directors for months.
The statement maintained that McLean had frequently expressed his
unhappiness and his readiness to go if a suitable settlement could be
worked out.
Last night Robinson seemed sure that he and his fellow board members
had gone a long way to meet the requirements of McLean, who signed a
three-year contract last summer with a salary of #90,000 a year.
But there was no official response from McLean, who will, I
understand, meet with his lawyer and accountant this weekend. It seems
that the offer falls far short of what he might be looking for from a
contract which he signed in good faith after quitting the manager's job
at Motherwell.
That could push Robinson and his board into a corner. They have
decided they want McLean out but, as yet, might not have come up with an
acceptable settlement.
The troubles between McLean and the men who employed him just a year
ago came early. Having managed Motherwell to Scottish Cup success and
guided them into Europe once more, he left Fir Park because of
disagreements with the directors about spending.
Motherwell wanted to build a second new stand -- McLean wanted to
strengthen his side for a premier-division title challenge. McLean
walked out.
Soon afterwards Robinson and Leslie Deans, the men who had bought out
Wallace Mercer to take control of Hearts, persuaded him to join them as
they tried to revive the club.
It was a challenge McLean accepted happily, fully expecting that he
would have a free hand in the transfer market. Instead, he found Hearts
involved in the same stand-building operations as Motherwell, and when
forced to sell Alan McLaren to Rangers, McLean was quickly
disillusioned.
The new men in control claimed they had found more problems than
anticipated and that ground rebuilding was a priority because of the
Taylor Report and all its implications.
McLean felt he had been misled, possibly even betrayed, when he signed
the three-year deal. The board began to feel that they had an unhappy
manager and that no progress could be made while he remained.
Since the end of the season McLean has looked at various team-building
options and found himself thwarted by the lack of funds. An opportunity
to go to Holland to look for fresh talent at reasonable prices was
vetoed by the directors, and that was one of the final disagreements
which precipitated the present crisis.
Hearts now say they have made a good offer -- ''This is not Mickey
Mouse money,'' I was told last night -- but McLean, I understand, does
not see things that way.
Meanwhile Hearts, with a #4m overdraft, drift closer and closer to
crisis -- a far cry from the brave new world offered by Robinson and
Deans when they assumed control.
As of last night, neither businessman Jim Glass, who has claimed he
wants to take over the club, nor anyone else had approached Robinson
with an offer.
Meanwhile, if McLean is bought off, Hearts must look for another
manager -- and be ready to pay suitable compensation.

SHOOTING the messengers who brought the news was not the reaction from
Gordon Sherry when a group of golf writers went to the practice ground
at St Andrews to tell the Amateur champion that his partners for the
first two rounds of the Open Championship would be . . . gulp . . . Greg
Norman and Tom Watson.
The detached observer was inclined to think that however
self-possessed Sherry might be this was a little over-egging of the
pudding. Not Sherry, though. ''A bad draw, eh?'' he joked. ''You think
it's a fix? They're probably saying they're playing with a drink.''
Becoming serious, Sherry added: ''It's unbelievable. It was always
going to happen, it's just come a bit earlier than I thought. But it's
not difficult to live with; all my hard work has paid off and last
week's experience in the Scottish Open will help a lot. I'm going to
feel really confident.''
Watson is five times winner of the title and Norman twice, and Sherry,
although then only three years old, was at the final day when, at
Turnberry in 1977, the former won his second championship, and he
remembers vividly the latter's fine play for a 74 in rough weather in
the third round in 1986 when the Australian won his first Open, also
over the Ailsa course.
Still on the crest of confidence after his equal fourth finish at
Carnoustie, Sherry added: ''I'll just go out and do the best I can.'' He
will have no misgivings about coping with the Old Course since only last
month, in difficult conditions, he was nine under par as runner-up in
the St Andrews Links Trophy.
Sherry was working under the watchful eye of his coach Bob Torrance,
whose son Sam, frustrated at the snail-like pace of play, abandoned his
practice round along with David Feherty and Phil Mickelson in favour of
going home to Wentworth for the night and returning today.
Sherry should have had the chance for a preliminary experience of
playing with another icon of the game. However, Gary Player was delayed
after receiving his honorary degree at St Andrews University (his
missing luggage meant that he attended the ceremony wearing a pair of
Bob Charles' underpants) and Sherry instead went off with Vijay Singh
and David Frost.

BRITAIN'S Jonathan Edwards broke the world triple jump record last
night . . . at a meeting to prove his fitness.
The Gateshead Harrier delivered a spectacular response to the demands
of Britain's selectors by leaping 17.98 metres in the altitude of
Salamanca, Spain.
It was one centimetre further than the 10-year-old record set by
American Willie Banks in Indianapolis.
Edwards was one of 13 athletes asked to prove his fitness for the
world championships when the selectors announced their team on Monday.
He had missed the weekend's trials at Birmingham after having pulled
out of his last competition, at Crystal Palace, with a sore ankle.
Edwards had been threatening the record since last month's European
Cup in Lille, when he produced the longest jump in history -- 18.43m.
The wind then was over the legal limit of two-metres-per-second. So,
too, was it when he jumped 18.03m at Gateshead a week later.
But last night, the wind was a helpful 1.8mps, and Edwards took full
advantage to establish himself as favourite for the world title in
Gothenburg next month.
Edwards said later: ''The first thing I did was look at the wind
speed. The day has been perfect and the Salamanca track is very fast.
Under these conditions I knew I could beat the record again.
''Technically the jump was not good. I started the run too far
forward. Yesterday, while training, I made some good jumps and noticed
the speed of the course. I thought it would be a great contest.''

I FIND it staggering that ''five Tory councillors have been appointed
along with nine Independents, to occupy #6000-a-year places on the new
public water authorities'' (Water storm for Forsyth, July 14).
It would appear that some of the councillors are already receiving
payment from a regional council, a district council and one of the new
unitary authorities. How often should a councillor be paid to represent
a group of people?
When it comes to feeding at a trough, which Mr Forsyth has filled with
taxpayer's money, the Tories are in a league of their own.

IT would have been rather naive of anyone to think Michael Forsyth's
appointment to Scottish Secretary would make any difference to Scottish
affairs -- his instructions come from Downing Street (probably No 11),
particularly on the water issue. The money-makers just can't wait to get
their hands wet.
However, this time the Scottish people have the whip-hand. If we
refuse to pay water bills to unelected quangos then they will wither
away from neglect. We only have to dig our heels in and stand firm.
It would be sensible and responsible, however, to set aside the water
bills money ready to pay the elected bodies when they are put in place
in order that urgent sewerage work can be carried out without further
delay.

IT is to be hoped that David R Yule is not to be considered as the
responsible voice of today's police service (July 13). His expressed
views have no foundation in the facts.
The business world finds that retired police persons form a dependable
workforce with above average skills in security, safety, and in
supervisory roles, and indeed are found in more modest positions as
office couriers and retail-trade floor-walkers. Police careers are often
unofficially geared to securing later appointments in the outside
employment market.
The pragmatic business mind realises that former police persons are
unlikely to hazard excellent pension rights by engaging in ''conduct
contrary to company policy'', which could result in forfeiture of the
police pension.
It is my understanding that most police forces maintain a well-thumbed
register of retirement job vacancies, and I assume Mr Yule's force does
likewise. Should he care not to avail himself of such second career
opportunities he will undoubtedly form part of an unenterprising
minority group.
Mr Yule's claims to police experience and job knowledge are singularly
unimpressive. I am scion of a very large family which has contributed
well over a century to the police service worldwide, literally from
Tomintoul to Timbuctoo, embracing Vancouver and Shanghai en route.
On the one side my father and six of his brothers were all serving
members of the Scottish police at the same time and completed
pensionable service without blemish.
On the other, the Rothneys provided both secretary and chairman of the
Scottish Police Federation, as Mr Yule will observe from available
records.
We do in fact have more than a passing interest in police affairs and
the disturbing trends that have overtaken the service in recent years,
trends which necessitated the Sheehy inquiry in response to
well-publicised public concern.
I apologise to James Freeman, home affairs reporter, for providing the
occasion of an unprovoked assault upon his standard of journalism by a
patently errant Mr Yule.

JOHN R Stephen (July 10) takes exception to David R Yule's assertion
that he may have been residing on another planet during the Sheehy
deliberations.
His denial of such extra-terrestrial activities would appear to be his
only accurate statement.
It appears that Mr Stephen's modus operandi when confronted by serving
police officers with facts not to his liking is to claim an emotional
element or doubting, for example, that Mr Yule and others ''have ever
experienced the benefits of traditional beat policing''.
Despite Mr Stephen's serious doubts, David R Yule is a hard-working
and well-respected beat officer whose well-expressed views reflect an
in-depth knowledge of the police service.
This appears to be outwith the understanding of your correspondent,
who is forever locked in a time warp of his own making, evident in his
apparent nostalgia at police officers ''long hours stationary at traffic
points'' etc.
He may not have noticed but computerised traffic lights (CITRAC) do it
better.

Highland Park, Michigan, Tuesday -- Chrysler Corporation reported an
86% plunge in profits for the second quarter, as its earnings fell to
$135m from $956m a year ago.
The No 3 automaker cited lower production volume, model changeover
costs associated with its new minivans and higher incentive costs as
last year's red-hot car market cooled off in the spring.
Chrysler also attributed the weaker results to a $143m charge related
to production changes at its Newark, Delaware, assembly plant, higher
material costs, a leaner sales mix and lower sales in Mexico.
''Obviously the second quarter was disappointing, but it was not a
surprise to us,'' Chrysler chairman Robert J Eaton said. ''The launch of
our all-new 1996 minivans resulted in lower production and we took
aggressive incentive actions to reduce our 1995 model inventories.
''The first six months of 1995 have reminded us just how competitive
the auto industry can be and how quickly the market can change,'' he
added. -- Reuter

STRICTER rules governing the behaviour of Ministers and civil servants
were announced by the Government yesterday, in advance of a potentially
explosive debate today on the Nolan inquiry into standards in public
life.
A new Civil Service Code and tougher guidelines for former Ministers
who accept lucrative posts in the private sector are among measures
designed to reinforce the public's confidence in a Government hit by a
succession of damaging ''sleaze'' allegations.
The new Public Services Minister, Mr Roger Freeman, told MPs the
Government has accepted most of the Nolan recommendations affecting the
conduct of Government. ''The Prime Minister has made it clear that he is
determined to uphold the highest standards in public life,'' he said.
However, he left to MPs themselves the contentious question of outside
earnings, on which Lord Nolan and his Government-appointed committee
recommended strong action.
Labour gave the Government's response to the Nolan report a qualified
welcome.
However, Shadow Leader of the House Ann Taylor warned more was needed
to counter the impression of an ''elected dictatorship'' abusing the
public trust.
''The spirit of the report demands not just new codes of conduct,
useful though they may be, but a new attitude on the part of Ministers
to replace the arrogance that has become the hallmark of this Government
after too long in office,'' she said.
''The elected dictatorship must give way to an executive with a real
sense of service to the people it seeks to serve.'' She called on the
Government to allow the Nolan committee to examine the funding of
political parties.
Labour also expressed reservations over Government amendments to its
guidelines for Ministers, which have been qualified to say Ministers
must not ''knowingly'' mislead Parliament.
Mrs Taylor said sometimes Ministers ''choose not to know'', but Mr
Freeman rejected as ''utterly wrong'' what he described as a ''slur'' on
those in public life. Ministers occasionally were not fully aware of the
facts when addressing the House, he said.
The principal reforms proposed by the Government, based on the Nolan
recommendations, include:
* Ministers will henceforth come under the remit of the Committee on
Business Appointments. The Government will draw up new criteria for the
committee to define when a former Minister should delay taking up a
private sector job. The rules will be debated by the Commons in the
autumn before being put into force.
* The Government endorses the Nolan Committee's recommendation that
Ministers should not accept hospitality that would or might appear to
place them under an obligation. There should be no distinction between a
Minister's conduct as a minister and his conduct as an MP.
* A new Commissioner for Public Appointments will be appointed to
monitor and offer guidance on quango appointments. * The use of advisory
bodies, ''including an independent element'', will be extended to cover
appointments to executive public bodies and the NHS.
* Civil servants should have the opportunity, as recommended by Nolan,
to raise in confidence concerns about actions in which they are not
personally involved. After consultation, the new Civil Service Code will
be put in place before the end of the year.
Mr Freeman told MPs: ''I am confident the action we have set out will
show the House, and the country as a whole, our determination to take
practical steps which will uphold and sustain the highest standards of
propriety, while ensuring the men and women of talent and experience
continue to enrich our public life''.
The Nolan Commitee's first report included calls for protection
against political interference in the Civil Service, full and prompt
inquiries into allegations of ministerial misconduct, and independent
oversight of appointments.

THE wife of Barings trader Nick Leeson broke down and wept yesterday
when she learned that the report laid the blame at her husband's door.
For Lisa Leeson the strain of trying to lead a normal life as her
husband languished in a German jail became too much and her composure
broke.
Since her husband was arrested at Frankfurt airport she has been
making a weekly round trip to Germany to spend 60 minutes with him while
he contests attempts to extradite him to Singapore.
At the tea rooms in Kent where she now works two days a week to help
fund her air tickets to Germany, Mrs Leeson said of the report: ''Until
Nick comes home we will never know the truth.''
She said at Elizabeth's Tea Rooms in Maidstone: ''I don't suppose we
expected anything different from today's report.
''I don't know what he (Nick) will think about it. To be honest when
you only have an hour to spend with your husband you talk about other
things.
''But I have never questioned what he did and what he didn't do.''
Mrs Leeson who is now living with her family in West Kingsdown, Kent,
admitted that she was under a lot of pressure, especially with her
husband being held so far away.
But she added: ''If someone else had their husband abroad they would
do the same. It is a lot of pressure and Nick has his bad days and
not-so-bad days.
''We just hope that he is able to come back to the UK and give his
side.
''It's been going on a long time now. We just feel as if we are in a
deep, dark tunnel.''
Meanwhile, Mr Leeson has never had so much time on his hands and so
little to do.
Fighting extradition proceedings to Singapore, he spends his evenings
at a laptop computer and still follows the currency and stock markets
from a radio and TV in his cell.
But however humane the prison conditions, it is a world away from his
high-flying life as a trader where his bonus alone in 1993 totalled
#100,000.
Half-a-dozen TV companies are bidding to secure the rights to his life
story for an ITV drama-documentary to be made later this year.
They see as fascinating his rise from a modest council home in
Watford, Hertfordshire, to banking in the Singapore fast lane.
Mr Leeson, a plasterer's son, became one of the rising stars of
international finance after moving away from suburbia.
At 18, he left Parmiters School, Watford, where he had failed A-level
maths, to join Coutts and Co, the Queen's bankers, as a junior clerk.
Described as quiet and unpretentious at Coutts, he moved three years
ago to Singapore with Barings and was viewed on the trading floor as
arrogant, cocky, and outgoing.
In March 1992, he married Lisa Sims, then a 21-year-old clerk at
Barings and the daughter of a printer from West Kingsdown, Kent.
Last year, Barings directors were told by accountants Coopers and
Lybrand that the main threat to the bank's high profits from Singapore
would be losing the general manager office -- Nick Leeson.
His highly unusual role as chief futures trader and manager of the
back office allowed him to supervise his own transactions as he amassed
a portfolio of 20,000 contracts gambling on Japanese shares and bonds.
If extradited and convicted in Singapore, he will serve his sentence
in Changi, a high security jail on the site of the infamous Japanese
prisoner-of-war camp.
He has been assured he will not be flogged or face the death penalty.
However, the regime at Changi is tough and a far cry from Hoechst
prison, Frankfurt.
Those who choose the programme of education in the German prison come
under the tutelage of the ministry of education. The syllabus includes
A-level mathematics.

STAKIS hotels are continuing to perform well, but the group's 23
casinos turned in a dull performance during the third quarter of the
current financial year.
Glasgow-based Stakis said room occupancy rates at its 41 hotels rose
to 75% during the three months to July 2 from 73.3% during the same
period last year.
This allowed Stakis to nudge up the average room rate to #44.46 from
#41.58 previously.
''Our performance has been improving fairly steadily now for five or
six quarters so this is the continuation of a trend,'' said chief
executive David Michels.
Stakis has thrived by building up a nationwide chain of large and well
sited hotels that cater for both businessmen and tourists.
But the number of punters visiting the group's casinos has declined
since they introduced admission charges nine months ago to discourage
small spenders.
Casino attendances fell 3.7% to 471,000 in the third quarter and the
amount of money placed in bets dipped 2.6% to #63.6m.
But the average spend per gambler rose 1.3% to #135 and casino
earnings from the gaming margin improved to 19.1% from 17.1%.
''The casinos are flat, but not down,'' Mr Michels said.
''Admission charges have discouraged the small punters who just want
to come for a drink and spend a bob or two,'' he added.
More difficult to quantify is the National Lottery's negative effect
on the gaming tables.
''It is probably affecting us slightly,'' Mr Michels said, estimating
that casino turnover had fallen between 1% and 2% as a result.
Last April Stakis bought a hotel at Corby in the East Midlands and a
month later it opened a new hotel at Edinburgh airport.
Its latest acquisition, the 93-room Glasgow City Hotel, situated just
off Buchanan Street, opened yesterday.
This #4m hotel, built by property developers Stewart Watt, is the
first that Stakis is operating on a management contract. The group has
an option to buy it outright after four years.
Mr Michels said Stakis hoped to acquire one or two more hotels later
this year, but he emphasised that the group would continue its policy of
cherry picking the best individual properties on the market.
Its targets are basically well-located 100-room hotels in the three
and four star categories.
City analysts were well pleased at the continued improvement in
Stakis's hotel business, which was in line with expectations.
Simon Johnson of London broker BZW said he was forecasting pre-tax
profits of #27.5m this year, up from #20.2m in 1994.
Stakis shares were unchanged at 84p.

IBM has enjoyed record second-quarter sales and earnings, stunning
Wall Street's most optimistic forecasters.
IBM earned $1700m on sales of $17.5bn. The performance more than
doubled IBM's results in the same quarter of 1994, when it earned $689m
on sales of $15.3bn.
''This was a very good quarter,'' said Louis Gerstner, IBM chairman
and chief executive.
''Although our merger with Lotus has drawn a lot of attention in
recent weeks, we made important strategic progress in the quarter in
other areas of IBM as well,'' said Mr Gerstner.
''Despite everything we have accomplished, however, it's important to
recognise that maintaining our momentum will require continued progress
in all areas of the company,'' said Mr Gerstner.
IBM is planning to issue a more detailed statement on its UK
operations today.
Last year the multinational's UK operations went into the black for
the first time since 1990, making a profit of #176m on turnover of
#4400.
The company builds personal computers for sale in Europe, Africa, and
the Middle East at a plant in Greenock which employs 3000 people.
Industry sources say IBM is planning to reinforce its Scottish
operations later this year by centralising its telephone helpline
services for the whole of Europe in Greenock.
The move should create hundreds of new jobs as IBM recruits
computer-wise staff able to talk pc users through their problems on the
phone in languages ranging from French to Norwegian.
Despite the strong results, IBM's stock slipped 25 cents in pre-open
trading to $107 a share after jumping $3.375 to $107.25 on Monday. The
stock had traded for less than $50 as recently as two years ago.
Mr Gerstner warned that year-over-year financial comparisons will
become more difficult in the second half.
''Also, there are a few signs that demand may be slowing and price
pressures increasing in the US and a number of key European countries
remain sluggish,'' he said.
Revenues increased in all geographic areas in the second quarter, the
company said.
North America revenues were $7100m, an increase of 8.9% from the same
period last year. Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa totalled
$6100m, up 11.5%, while Asia-Pacific revenues were $3600m, an increase
of 30.9%. Revenues from Latin America were $742m, up 19.7% from the
second quarter of last year.
Hardware sales totalled $8600m in the second quarter, up 12.5% from a
year ago. Sales of personal computers, RS/6000 workstations, AS/400
minicomputers and storage products increased significantly.
''We must implement our technology and marketing strategies -- quickly
and skilfully -- and we must keep meeting our cost reduction goals,'' Mr
Gerstner added. ''Nevertheless, I remain pleased overall with the pace
of transformation at IBM.''
Chrysler reports
big fall in profits
Highland Park, Michigan, Tuesday -- Chrysler Corporation reported an
86% plunge in profits for the second quarter, as its earnings fell to
$135m from $956m a year ago.
The No 3 automaker cited lower production volume, model changeover
costs associated with its new minivans and higher incentive costs as
last year's red-hot car market cooled off in the spring.

A TEACHER saw his wife plunge 200ft to her death after they had both
fallen while descending a Highland mountain.
Mrs Janet Harper, 34, a nurse, and her husband, Marquis, 31, of
Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, had climbed two of the Five Sisters of Kintail
and had decided to cut short their ascent of the third, Sgurr Nan
Faigsaighead, because of bad weather when they slipped on wet ground on
Monday evening.
Mr Harper fell 50ft but his wife plunged 200ft on to rocks and scree.
Mr Harper scrambled down to raise the alarm.
Mrs Harper's body was found at 5am yesterday by a member of RAF
Kinloss mountain rescue team and his dog in a corrie on the mountain's
north-east face.
Corporal Nigel Kenworthy, the deputy leader of the RAF Kinloss team,
said: ''There had been a lot of rain in the area and the grass was very
wet. It seemed they both slipped as they were making a descent. It was
basically a simple slip as they tried to find a way down in the bad
weather.''
Mr Ron Porter, leader of the Kintail mountain rescue team, said the
couple were well equipped.

COURTAULD's shares sank 14p to 435p after it warned that it was
proving difficult to pass on higher raw material prices.
Chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said that the sharply higher raw
material prices which caused a fall in margins in the second half of
last year in some of the businesses had persisted into the first half of
the current financial year.
Although there are signs that some raw material prices have peaked,
Sir Christopher added that there would be a time-lag in passing on the
higher costs.
The comments were made at the group's annual meeting and although a
bearish statement had been expected, City analysts were quick to
downgrade their forecasts. Smith New Court shaved #15m off its 1996
profit forecast and is expecting Courtauld's to make #160m with #200m,
down from #215m, pencilled in for 1997.
In terms of the businesses, the raw material price increases are being
most keenly felt in the fibres and chemicals division. Attempts to pass
on the higher prices have led to a marked slowdown in the market for
acrylic fibres and this is not expected to recover until the final
quarter of 1995 at the earliest.
Viscose pulp prices are continuing to rise which could put further
downward pressure on both demand and margins in the second half of the
year. On the positive side, demand for Tencel, its revolutionary new
fibre, is significantly ahead of last year. It is increasingly being
used in women's clothing in the UK. The markets for chemicals and
acetate remain healthy and trading is said to be strong.
Trading in coatings and sealants is said to be making steady progress.
Pressure on margins is beginning to ease but it will be the second half
of the year before the full benefits are felt.
Growth continues to be strong in the Far East operations and the
restructuring programme, provided for in the 1993-94 accounts, is said
to be on target. Polymer Products is at, or ahead of, expectations with
a particularly encouraging performance from Performance Films.
Courtauld's interest charge in the first half will reflect the
significantly higher average borrowings compared with the same period
last year. However, it was emphasised that gearing and interest cover
will remain at ''comfortable'' levels.

Stewart Fraser plots a course to venues where getting your sea legs is
second nature.
YOU'VE decided to take up boating, and you're going to enjoy it,
probably as a family. So what's the next step? For the stereotype Scot,
the answer is to borrow someone else's boat. Persuade an experienced
skipper to come along, and do whatever work is involved.
In real life, you go to a sailing school. You learn how to handle a
suitable craft, by sail and by power. Learning the ropes is fun, as well
as merely instructional.
Next stage is likely to be joining a club in your locality, finding
who needs an experienced crew -- that's you, by the way -- and extending
your know-how as much as you can.
It's difficult to be exact, but there are around three dozen places in
Scotland where anyone can get a grounding in water sports. We're
extending the interest here -- to water sports. The reality is that the
kids may decide they want to go canoeing or surfing, while you take to
the boats.
No problem. Scotland has extensive facilities these days. They go from
Stranraer to the Clyde, on to Skye and Orkney, down to Queensferry and
beyond.
You're not even limited to coastal areas. Loch Lomond attracts
visitors by the score. Fife has Lochore Meadows. There is Lochearnhead
in Perthshire, and Strathclyde has its country park.
Exactly how do you go about things? You ask someone who knows. The
local information office is a good starting point, and staff are
universally helpful.
And let's reveal what seem to be some well-kept secrets. Go to Largs
and you'll find signposts pointing the way to the Scottish National
Sports Centre in in Burnside Road lost.
There, you can get a free brochure, pointing you a mile offshore, to
Great Cumbrae. That's where you can do your RYA course: competent crew,
day skipper, coastal skipper, yachtmaster. Day cruising, weekend
cruising, and ladies only as well.
While you're in the area, look into the Largs Yacht Haven and Kip
Marina. What do you find? Dinghy and yachting courses, yacht charter,
cruising, and an energetic Dughall macLachlainn actively promoting
sailing as a corporate hospitality activity.
''It's really a unique event in this area, and we're very keen to
extend it,'' he says. ''It's such a marvellous area for sailing, we find
the business community see it as very acceptable.''
Kip has a sailing centre also, with a range of activities from RYA
sailing instruction, to bareboat or skippered charter. Motor cruising
can cover day skipper or the more advanced coastal skipper
qualification.
Marina director Martin Latimer is a firm believer in encouraging
owners, particularly those with no previous experience, to take an
appropriate course when they take up boating.
''Let's face it, there can be a fair bit of money involved in buying a
boat,'' he points out. ''Making sure you know how to look after your
boat, your crew, and yourself, is only sensible.''
The Scottish Tourist Board have come up with a comprehensive brochure
on watersports, covering interests from sailing school and yacht
charters to motorboat cruising and white water rafting.
A free copy can be obtained by writing to: Scottish Holidays,
Freepost, Glasgow G3 7BR, or telephone 0345 511511 (local charge) for
more information.
Last and certainly not least, there is the new Sail Scotland set-up,
based in Dunoon, and offering a hotline via 0139 705533, to meet
inquiries on everything: where to learn to sail, to handle a motor
cruiser, to get spares, to take part in a muster, or do some racing.
''This is a way of marketing watersports generally,'' says manager
Philip Smith. ''We have around 80 members, all the main operators.
Individual companies may not have a budget to market themselves. We can
do things on a joint basis, get the information out, bring the visitors
in.''

SCOTLAND will make its return to the finals of the European Nations
Men's Hockey Cup following an absence of eight years, after having
missed out on Paris. But only four members of the 16-strong squad --
Alistair Seaton, Jimmy Cox, David Leiper, and Duncan Low, the captain --
have survived from the Moscow finals of 1987.
The four in question are the only members of the party who are on the
wrong side of 29 but Scotland, nevertheless, with a squad whose average
age is just under 27, will be among the oldest teams in the 12-nation
event.
Seven members of the squad, however, are aged under 25 and they will
obviously play an important part in Scotland's future after Dublin --
provided, of course, they attain a high classification to enable them to
get a foothold on the World Cup qualifying process.
The squad which coach Billy McPherson has finally decided upon is
along expected lines, with only two changes being made to that which
shared the three-match Test series earlier this month with France.
Shaun Middleton, of Grange, and Western's Roddy Thilp are the men to
give way to Michael Starling and John Mills, whose main role in Dublin
is likely to be that of ''odd-job men'' unless there are injuries to the
now established starting team.
The squad is:
Alistair Seaton (Old Loughtonians), Paul Mellor, David Leiper, Duncan
Low, captain, (all Grange), David Fowler, Gordon Moore, David Ralph,
Michael Starling (all Kelburne), David Johnson, Gordon Shepherd (both
Torbrex Wanderers), Jimmy Cox (Menzieshill), Richard Freeland (Touche
Ross Gordonians), Steve Grubb (MIM), Colin Hector (Old Loughtonians),
John Mills (Cannock), Mark Zander (East Grimstead).

GLASGOW'S Gary Jacobs last night shrugged off a challenge laid down by
Eamonn Loughran, the Irishman who holds the World Boxing Organisation
version of the world welterweight championship, rightly pointing out
that both he and Loughran had more pressing engagements with which to
concern themselves.
Jacobs was far from impressed by Loughran's ''bit of gamesmanship'' as
the Irishman heads for a fourth defence of his title against South
Africa's Luvuyo Kakaza in Belfast on August 5, while he himself is
preparing to meet World Boxing Council holder Pernell Whitaker in
Atlantic City three weeks later.
Loughran has for some time stated that he wants a showdown with the
Scot and yesterday the Ulsterman said that he had personally asked for
Jacobs. His manager, Barry Hearn, confirmed that he aims to make the
fight at the end of the year at the King's Hall, Belfast.
Loughran said: ''Jacobs has been slagging me off quite a bit and I
have asked Barry to get him. I want to prove to Jacobs that I'm the best
in Britain and, hopefully, that fight will be made.''
Jacobs, however, hit back last night. He told me: ''I shouldn't really
comment on something like this, because all my attention at the moment
is focused on Whitaker, whom I regard as the best of the various world
champions at the weight.''
He added, obviously tongue in cheek: ''Anyway, as Loughran already
holds a version of the title I would have thought he would have been
looking for more meaningful fights than one against Gary Jacobs.
''Mind you, in all the ratings that matter I am ahead of him. Maybe he
feels he is not getting the recognition he deserves. But what does he
deserve -- he hasn't beaten anyone of note.
''Let's wait and see what happens in our next fights. If I beat
Whitaker -- and I firmly believe I can -- and he is still WBO champion,
then, by all means, we can sit down and talk about a unification
fight.''
* STEVE Robinson, under pressure to give Naseem Hamed a shot at his
WBO featherweight crown, insists that the #1m showdown take place in
Cardiff.
Sheffield super-bantamweight Hamed is willing to step up a weight for
the world title he craves, but the choice of venue is the latest
stumbling block in his bid to take on the Welshman.

ITALY'S Vincenzo Nardiello will not be counting on Nigel Benn's fight
plan being upset by any painful mental flashbacks at the London Arena on
Saturday.
It will be Benn's first contest since his ferocious and tragic WBC
super-middleweight title clash with America's Gerald McClellan at the
same venue in February.
Nardiello, a former policeman from the resort of Ostia near Rome,
said: ''What happened to McClellan may have affected Nigel emotionally,
but I'm not banking on it. I saw the 'war' with McClellan live on
television, but it certainly didn't frighten me. You come to expect
these kind of things when you are a fighter. That's the chance we all
take.''
* HENRY Wharton has been ordered to defend his European
super-middleweight title -- less than a fortnight after having won it in
devastating style.
Wharton will have to meet ex-champion Frederic Seillier, of France, by
the end of the year, the European Boxing Union have ordered.
The fact that Seillier -- who holds a fifth-round victory over Nigel
Benn's next opponent Vincenzo Nardiello -- has been installed as No.1
challenger eliminates any chance of a rematch with Mauro Galvano.

THE Scottish athletics team for this weekend's international against
Wales, Israel, Turkey, and Northern Ireland in Cardiff has been left in
tatters by call-offs.
No less than 16 competitors from the original 37 selected are unable
to travel for the two-day match on Saturday and Sunday, Scotland's most
important international fixture of the year.
''It makes you wonder whether people want to compete for Scotland any
more,'' said Ann Scott. In the unenviable debut role of team manager,
she will be particularly hard-pressed to muster relay squads.
Injury accounts for some of the absentees, but others, clearly, just
do not relish the long coach trip south.
World championship internationalists Yvonne Murray and Melanie Neef
are booked for Sunday's BUPA invitation meeting at Sheffield, while
David Strang, named for the 1500 metres, will be chasing a world 800m
qualifying time, possibly in both Oslo on Friday, and at Sheffield.
The men originally chosen at 400, 800, 1500, 5000 and 3000m
steeplechase, plus the 400m hurdles, long jump, and pole vault --
respectively Brian Whittle, Tom McKean, Strang, Chris Robison, Graeme
Croll, Mark Davidson, Duncan Mathieson, and Des Fitzgerald have all
declined.
A replacement for Croll has been found in Billy Jenkins, but the
Greenock Glenpark steeplechaser is doubtful, having suffered an injury
during the AAA championships. Barry Middleton comes in for fellow
Aberdonian Davidson in the hurdles, and Iain Black for Pitreavie's
Fitzgerald.
The team could yet be deprived of Ken Campbell, who hopes to be
offered a hurdles lane in Sheffield after his fastest time of the season
in Birmingham, but Martin Bell, who broke his Scottish 10,000m walk
record there, is committed to appearing.
''I hope to break the record again, and feel I could challenge for an
Olympic place next year,'' said the exiled Annan athlete who will be
competing on what is now his home track.
Commonwealth team captain Geoff Parsons has yet to confirm his
availability, but if he cannot do better than last weekend, when he
failed to record a height, it would be better if his high jump place
went to David Barnetson. The Inverness man beat Parsons last weekend and
also took the Scottish title when Parsons did not attend.
Mathieson fell just 2cm short of the native record in the long jump
last weekend while setting a Scottish decathlon record, but he is too
tired to compete. Darren Ritchie looks the best replacement candidate.
With Sinead Dudgeon attending a Great Britain junior relay practice,
Aileen McGillivary will double up in both the 100 and 200m. Val Bothams
(City of Glasgow) replaces Murray; Sue Ridley comes in for Scottish
5000m champion Hayley Haining; and hurdler Claire Mackintosh for Joss
Harwood who has retired following her Scottish title win.
Edinburgh Woollen Mill's Lorna Jackson (javelin) is the only AAA title
winner available for her country, and only eight of the 30 Scottish
champions from Meadowbank last month will be on duty. Team (men first):
100 metres: Ian Mackie, Aileen McGillivary. 200m: Douglas Walker,
McGillivary. 400m: AN Other, AN Other. 800m: AN Other, Vicky Lawrence.
1500m: AN Other, Val Bothams. 5000m: AN Other, Sue Ridley. 10,000/5000m

Mackintosh. 400m hurdles: Barry Middleton, Jane Low. 3000m steeplechase:

Black. Long jump: AN Other, Ruth Irving. Triple jump: Neil McMenemy,
Karen Skeggs. Shot: Steve Whyte, Tracy Shorts. Discus: James Muirhead,

WHILE comments about a negative property market continue to infiltrate
the media from sources south of the Border, one Glasgow estate agent is
reeling off statistics which prove beyond doubt that confidence is
returning to the Scottish market.
Clyde Property's Bearsden branch sold 61 houses last month, compared
to 46 in June 1994; in May it was 55 against 36 in the same month last
year.
Overall, the company report that the number of houses sold between
April and June this year is up by 42%, which equates to #15.6m of
property compared to #12.2m for the same period last year.
The agents report a similar pattern for their Shawlands branch, where
the number of houses sold between April and June is up by 37% on last
year's figures. ''In real terms there has not been a rise in individual
house prices, but there is far more activity in the market -- and that
means confidence is definitely returning,'' says director Gary Thomson.
''Since the beginning of the year we have seen a steady rise in the
level of enquiries and number of sales. In fact, each month's figures
have exceeded those of corresponding months for the past two years.
''We are also seeing more competitive closing dates, and although
relocation has also increased, the majority of houses are being bought
by local buyers who are trading up.''
According to Gary Thomson, this upturn in confidence is best
demonstrated by the current shift in seller's attitudes. ''Last year
over 85% of clients were waiting until they had sold before even daring
to look around for a new home.
''Now we are seeing far more people buying before they have put their
home on the market. And with average selling times of under six weeks,
they know that if their house is accurately priced, it will sell,'' he
says.
The company believes that confidence and activity will continue.
''Compared to last year, it's already a very different market,'' says
Gary Thomson.
But it's not just homeowners who are reacting to this newfound
confidence; changes in the tempo of the property market have suffused
Clyde Property's directors with enough optimism to expand their Glasgow
network, and a new branch is due to open shortly in Byres Road in the
West End.
As estate agents have also been sitting on the fence, Clyde Property
are the first to invest in expansion for several years, and when estate
agents take this step, it's usually a good omen for long-term market
prosperity.

Jamie Armstrong's Projekt 11:92 is successfully developing dance in
the community but, as MARY BRENNAN hears, it hasn't been easy
RESPECT. Hard work. Commitment. A heart for it. . . These words
regularly find their way to the front line as Jamie Armstrong talks
about dance, the community, and Projekt 11:92. More to the point, he
puts his energy where his mouth is.
No way does he mooch around waiting for someone to bankroll his
dreams. Instead, he head-hunts opportunities. He creates possibilities,
collars folk, points out gaps in provision, offers to do the necessary.
The result? Tough kids, shy kids, kids with special needs, kids in
schemes where there's nothing to do, kids with inner pzazz that no-one
ever noticed before: they're all dancing now.
Armstrong himself didn't take up dancing till he was 22, and even then
he never imagined that one day he'd be heading a company geared to
developing dance in the community. He'd been an apprentice electrician,
subsequently running his own business. Exercise came from playing rugby
for Glasgow, until a latent heart defect put a stop to that. ''Running
and all that was fine -- it was the risk from any sudden impact that was
the problem.''
A casual interest in dance -- ''I'd done school shows, that sort of
thing'' -- began to shape up into something more compelling and he
started going to classes. First stop: ballet. Not, as it turned out, an
ideal choice.
''I just wasn't designed for it,'' he says with a grin. ''All that
rugby -- I'd got these great round thighs, a body built for centre
field. It just didn't feel right -- no way could I do a pas de chat
across the floor without my bottle crashing!''
So he focused more and more on jazz dance instead. Towards the end of
the eighties, dance had got such a grip on him that he chucked the day
job and auditioned for a panto. ''Babes in the Wood, King's Theatre,
Edinburgh. And that was it. For the next three-and-a-half years I did
the commercial circuit, where if you are a size eight shoe and the
tights fit, you've got the job.''
He jokes about it, but it was a crucial learning experience. Aside
from the bits of technical know-how and stagecraft that he picked up,
Armstrong also realised that something was lacking about the job.
There was. Back in Glasgow (''skint and ready really for anything'')
he became involved with a special needs project. Everything clicked into
place. As he says: ''I found my heart again. My heart was back in the
dance.''
November 1992, was, for him, the true beginning -- hence the name of
his company Projekt 11:92. But despite his resolution, his innate
get-up-and-go attitude, it wasn't all plain sailing.
''I drew up this project and took it to people in local authorities.
They all said: 'Great. It's really, really good, but we don't know you.
Thanks, but no.' I'd seen it as a three-month thing. They were
eventually offering money for one weekend.''
He was on the verge of selling insurance when he was offered a post as
dance artist-in-residence with Strathclyde region's social work
department.
City Story -- the latest Projekt 11:92 venture -- really sums up what
Armstrong and his team are all about. On the surface it is a look at
dance trends in Glasgow from the fifties to the present day.
''Dance is just the window we are picking,'' he says. ''Really it's
the whole social thing. It's about identity -- about guys getting
respect for their dancing -- and it's about status and control, and the
pressures society puts on people. The way that things nowadays are so
much faster and people are exploited -- and that includes being ignored,
having no respect from society.''
Some #2500 of Projekt 11:92's own earnings -- made through workshops
and teaching -- has gone into City Story. ''I don't believe that the
Arts Council should give us -- give anyone -- a grant just to be a
performance company. There's work out there needing done, ways of
earning. Everyone involved with this company knows what graft is. We'd
done other jobs, we didn't get a grant for that!''
There speaks an impressively practical visionary: one with a head for
business, willing feet and a big heart for community dance.
* City Story, a nineties street ballet, can be seen at the Cottier
Theatre, Glasgow, tonight and tomorrow at 7.30pm.

Alasdair Fraser has made a successful living out of playing fiddle
after quitting his highly paid job a decade ago. ROB ADAMS explains how
Scotland has influenced the musician's career
ALASDAIR Fraser was sitting in his office, jotting down a fiddle tune
on an improvised sheet of manuscript paper. He had a good job, as a
petrophysicist with BP in California, which he enjoyed. But it wasn't
what he really wanted to do.
So he resigned, and 10 years on he now travels some 80,000 miles a
year from his Sacramento home, playing concerts, taking workshops, and
generally passing on the sheer joy that picking up a fiddle and playing
gives him.
His efforts have rewarded him with the reputation as natural heir to
the great Scots fiddlers Neil Gow and Scott Skinner. He has a natural
abhorrence of music being allowed to stagnate, which is why for his
latest album, the splendid Dawn Dance, and his imminent Scottish tour he
recruited a keyboard player who has performed with the Who and the
Rolling Stones, a percussionist with a background in medieval and
renaissance music, a flautist who has mastered both baroque and Celtic
styles, and the champion piper who, for his sins, arranged and conducted
the pipe band on Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells II.
''I just wanted to see what would happen if I brought together these
people from different backgrounds,'' Fraser says of an album which has a
distinct Scottish accent. The idiomatic language of his homeland plays a
major part in Clackmannan-born Fraser's very expressive playing, and his
need to come back to the source explains why at least a tenth of those
80,000 miles he travels each year are transatlantic.
Since 1987 he has been running an annual week-long summer fiddle
course at Sabhal Mor Ostaig college on Skye. The same ''let's see what
happens if'' philosophy that lies behind Dawn Dance is used in force.
''I never say 'This is what you should do,' because I think players
should find their own self-expression, which wasn't the way it was
happening when I was growing up,'' he says. ''It was, 'This is the way
this tune is written and this is the way you're going to play it.' End
of story, which is ridiculous.''
Fraser began classical violin lessons as an eight-year-old. ''The
boy-violin identity has improved greatly since then,'' he says,
referring to the high incidence of retrieving his violin case from
hedges.
Before moving to America in 1981 he worked in dance bands. His
influences include jazz musicians. ''Stephane Grappelli, obviously, but
not just violinists, I really admire the way horn players have spent
years honing their tones. Tone is very important to me because I like to
make the fiddle sing and if you have a good tone you can make the
instrument project further, it's a happier instrument.''
Hearing him talk about fiddle playing (his enthusiasm for the
instrument can take on an almost paternal pride), it's easy to see why
his courses on Skye have become so popular. For the past 12 years he has
also run two week-long summer Scottish fiddling workshops in the
California Redwoods. ''And ofcourse, I learn from these courses too.
Sometimes by asking 'what happens if I do this?' I'll come up with a new
idea -- only to discover it was a new idea 200 years ago!''
* The Alasdair Fraser Band tours Scotland until July 29. It is at
Woodside Halls, Glasgow tonight, Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh tomorrow, and
Paisley Arts Centre on Friday.

SOME people get away with murder, and in bringing a swaggering Nazi
sympathiser and a Noel Cowardish figure together on a balcony to swap
ideas about sex, humiliation (national and personal), and their
potential place in history, Phil Willmott brings off one of cheekiest
ideas for some time. Whether you take it on a theatrical, political, or
sexual level -- and he has all three reflecting off each other -- it's a
dazzling piece of theatre.
Set in 1928, Venom does take a while to get into its stride. Writers,
even when, as in Wilmott's case, they are no mean directors, should
really be dissuaded from directing their own work. But with its brittle
dialogue, high-society country house and balcony scene setting, Wilmott
shows not only an ingenious talent to amuse but something more
substantial, as well.
At its centre is an uncompromising ''outing'' of the camp talent of
its closely closeted gay villain, Clive Gosling -- in Michael Grandage's
bravura performance, a character also of enormous theatrical appeal.
Through him, Wilmott suggests gay potential lies in many. He also writes
wittily on the unholy alliance of talent, ambition, and class hatred
that lay behind Coward's distinctive social snobbery.
Nicola Wright and Hugh Sachs make a tender pair of Gosling victims
(his long-suffering wife-of-convenience, and his ''royal'' male lover),
and Tamsin Greig's crisp, Gertrude Lawrence-inspired actress, Richard
Laing as her American evangelically inclined fiancee, and Simon Day's
body beautiful neo-Nazi play with a delicious sense of period.
A dramatist of serious comic promise has arrived.

AT his death in 1984 Eduardo de Filippo was recognised as one of
Italy's great twentieth-century playwrights. Yet, until 1945, he had
turned out light comedies for his own acting company in Naples. The
arrival of the American Army changed everything for his city and his
work. According to de Filippo, overnight Naples was dragged into the
twentieth century, and centuries of certainty and tradition vanished. De
Filippo's later works, including La Grande Magia written in 1948,
reflect his preoccupation with this changed world.
A man's wife is made to vanish by an itinerant conjuror. The magician
-- Bernard Cribbins in Richard Eyre's new production -- hands him a box
which, he tells him, contains the missing wife. The man (Alan Howard)
has only to open the box to release her. But he doesn't dare to do that,
preferring illusion to the possibility of disappointment.
De Filippo is a skilled comic writer. But the play is also an
excursion into the world of Luigi Pirandello, touching on themes of
obsession, power, and illusion.
Eduardo de Filippo was an actor for 80 years, and not surprisingly he
wrote great parts for his leading men. Cribbins is a fine actor and it
is a treat to see him at the National. His charisma and versatility,
combined with Howard's intensity, and some excellent comic cameos by the
supporting cast, make for a highly enjoyable interpretation.

PERTHSHIRE'S a great area to stay in. Maybe 90 miles from 90% of the
rest of Scotland. Rural if you like, but with the county town offering a
good range of modern amenities and an interesting mix of housing styles,
sizes and prices. The rentals are a good bit down on the big cities.
As Bryce Mailer of the Perthshire Solicitors' Property Centre points
out, most lets are still carried out through local legal offices. The
centre itself has some 25 members, and has been in business for quarter
of a century.
He says: ''We get inundated with inquiries from youngsters starting
off in housing and people relocating to the Perth area. In the last five
years, the town has experienced growth in new-build, which attracted
people from outside.
''What some called the influx of 'white settlers' has calmed down
now,'' he adds diplomatically.
''There is probably an increased demand for unfurnished properties, as
people rent to get a feel of the market before making a final decision.
We don't see any signs of panic buying here. There is a good quality of
life, and people seem to enjoy the area for its inherent qualities.''
Local solicitors Robertson &amp; Black, with offices in the county as
well, can offer a traditional stone farmhouse at Alyth, handy for town
commuting, and with extensive views to the Sidlaws.
You get an entrance porch, hallway, lounge, dining room, parlour - a
nice old-fashioned word still in use here with a landing to the upper
floor and four bedrooms, bathroom, and boxroom. The kitchen, and a
former dairy with stone-flagged floor, are on the ground floor.
Outside is a paved area to the house, a large area of rough grass, and
mature fruit trees. Rental around #500 a month.
Same general area, but a modern detached house with 120ft of garden
space - great for a family let - brings hall, lounge/dining room,
morning room, kitchen, utility room, four bedrooms and two bathrooms.
Gas-fired central heating, double glazing, double garage, plus ample
parking space. All for #450.
In Perth, factoring agent and solicitors Kippen Campbell can offer
typically single-bedroom tenement flats for around #160-170 a month.
Right in the city centre, popular with students and younger clients,
these offer a bedroom, lounge, kitchen and bathroom. Unfurnished, clean
and tidy, affordable housing.
A luxury style house, at Auchterarder, in contrast would be nearer
#550 but providing three bedrooms lounge kitchen, bathroom, shower,
garden with garage or parking space. Double glazing and central heating
as standard.
The Property Centre, with its weekly guide for househunters, shows the
choice available. A four-bedroom farmhouse at Balbeggie comes in at #400
a month, while a three-bedroom bungalow at Forfar is offered at #475.
A three-bedroom cottage at Abernethy is on the market at #325, and one
with two bedrooms at Huntingtower is available for #300. There's a
property in Perth that would prefer to see no children, and no smokers
either, but most make no requirements other than for the usual
references and deposit.

IN one of the largest deals of its kind in Scotland, Edinburgh's
housing stock will be boosted by a #10m loan facility which Canmore
Housing Association has arranged with The Royal Bank of Scotland.
Most of the 30-year facility will be used to help finance Canmore's
scheme to build 300 units in Edinburgh and the surrounding districts.
The programme will include rented and shared-ownership housing. Grants
from Scottish Homes will provide nearly 70% of the finance. The
remainder of the bank loan will be used to re-finance some of Canmore's
existing borrowing, currently held with a number of different
institutions.
Alan Brown, director of Canmore Housing Association, says: ''The Royal
Bank has demonstrated a first-class knowledge of the market in which we
operate, and their helpfulness and flexibility has been the key to this
agreement.'' Canmore Housing Association, formed in 1975, now manages
more than 1000 new and improved properties in and around Edinburgh.
It also has a substantial development programme, including provision
for a variety of special needs.
Canmore advised by Touche Ross, invited tenders from several English
and Scottish Institutions. The Royal Bank's housing association finance
team is headed by Ronnie Jack, with Bill Mackintosh in Edinburgh.

* DUNDEE United last night completed the transfer of West Indian
Jerren Nixon to Swiss club Zurich. Former manager Ivan Golac rated Nixon
as a future world beater in the multi-million pound class, but the
player has been sold for #250,000 -- the same price United paid for him
18 months ago.
Nixon started just 24 games at Tannadice, making 35 appearances as a
substitute and scored 10 goals. He finished last season as top scorer as
United plunged into the first division, but manager Billy Kirkwood said
last night: ''He made it clear he wanted to leave and I have said all
along that I am only interested in players who wish to play for the
club.
''We consider the offer we got from Zurich to be a good one and are
letting him go now that all the loose ends have been tied up.''
Meantime, Tannadice defender Brian Welsh will miss their three-match
pre-season trip to Finland after having picked up a hip strain in
training.

BRIAN Laudrup made his first appearance of the season for Rangers in
the last of their closed-door games, against Clyde at Broadwood Stadium
last night -- with Paul Gascoigne watching from the sidelines for most
of the game.
Gascoigne and Gordon Durie came on for the last 20 minutes, replacing
Ian Ferguson and Ian Durrant, as the Ibrox side coasted to a 2-0 victory
with goals from Charlie Miller and Mark Hateley.
The Scottish champions fly out for a three-match tour of Denmark
tomorrow and get down to business on Friday night when they meet
Brondby.
* BRIAN Irvine, hero of Aberdeeen's fight for premier-division
survival, has been hit by injury.
The big defender has been unable to take part in any of the pre-season
build-up because of a trapped nerve in his back and the setback casts
doubts over Irvine being able to play in the Pittodrie club's tour,
which will be finalised today.
Manager Roy Aitken said: ''We do not know what caused the injury or
how long it will take to clear up but at this stage there's no point in
taking chances.''

CAITHNESS minister Kenneth Warner and his wife Anne yesterday made
significant progress in their attempt to renew the search for their son,
who was lost in a Middle East diving accident last month.
Specialist equipment has been made available for a search in the 200ft
deep stretch of water off the Egyptian coast, where Mr David Warner, 23,
and three companions died on June 15.
A remote control robotic device has been tracked down by the father of
Mr Warner's girlfriend, Miss Lisa Thomson, who also drowned in the
accident.
Mrs Warner had previously criticised the Egyptian authorities for
calling off the search for her son and failing to tell the family he had
died. She also appealed for British divers to conduct a renewed search
for her son's body.
Mr Warner, from Halkirk, near Thurso, Miss Thomson, 24, and two German
companions drowned while diving in the Gulf of Aqaba off the resort of
Dahab on the Sinai Peninsula.
Mr John Thomson travelled to the Middle East where he hired Israeli
divers, who recovered his daughter's body, but the bodies of Mr Warner
and the two Germans were not found.
Egyptian authorities refused to undertake a further search for the
missing bodies after they abandoned an earlier attempt when conditions
were deemed too dangerous.
A Foreign Office spokesman believed Mr Warner and his companions
probably were trapped while diving at too great a depth for their
equipment.
Speaking from his home in Hertfordshire yesterday, Mr Thomson said
high-tech equipment was ready to be transported from Alexandria to the
accident scene.
The device, which is fitted with powerful lamps, a video camera, and a
lifting mechanism, is designed to operate in deep water. Mr Thomson is
also making arrangements to obtain a search boat and specialist diving
personnel.
However, the search cannot get under way without the formal consent of
the Egyptian authorities. Representations on behalf of the two families
are currently being made through the Foreign Office.
An appeal fund, set up in Caithness at the weekend to help towards the
cost of the new search, has so far raised more than #2500.

<HEADLINE>Cleaner to bring job loss test case against council</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977322145</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCHOOL cleaner whose job was privatised has been given the go-ahead
to bring a test case against Borders Regional Council which also could
win compensation of up to #1000 each for dozens of her colleagues.
The case has significance for part-time workers throughout Scotland.
Along with 300 other cleaners, Mrs Anne Cunningham, a mother of two,
of Howden Crescent, Jedburgh, was made redundant in 1992 when, under
competitive tendering, Borders region lost the cleaning contract for its
80 secondary and primary schools to two private firms.
Because the cleaning staff worked less than 16 hours a week, there was
no compensation. Since then, Britain has accepted European legislation
giving part-time workers the same rights as full-time colleagues.
Backed by the transport workers' union, Mrs Cunningham took her case
to a preliminary tribunal hearing in Edinburgh.
Borders region claimed that the attempt to bring the case was
time-elapsed but the tribunal ruled unanimously that the European
development changes the situation and the full hearing is to proceed on
a date still to be fixed.
After privatisation, Mrs Cunningham and most of the council's former
cleaning workers were re-employed by private firms which won the
contracts, but with new rates of pay and conditions of service.
The #2.5m, three-year deal for schools and council buildings in the
Roxburgh, Berwickshire, and Ettrick and Lauderdale districts went to
Southdown Cleaning and Maintenance of East Kilbride.
Transport workers' union official Gerry Skelton said yesterday:
''Wages were cut from #3.68 an hour to just over #3, holiday entitlement
was reduced, and there was no sick pay.
''Part-time workers who had been in the local government
superannuation scheme found there was no provision. The annual take-
home pay of the average worker dropped by #1000.''
In a second contract covering Tweeddale district, another cleaning
company, Care Services, increased basic hourly pay.
Ironically, Mrs Cunningham, who cleans at Howdenburn Primary School,
Jedburgh, is working for Borders region again and will therefore be
claiming redundancy compensation from her existing employers.
The council reversed the privatisation trend earlier this month and
took back the cleaning contracts which had reached the end of their
three-year term. They are now being operated by its own Direct Services
Organisation.
A legal loophole means the council does not have to re-tender for the
next two years.
A council legal spokesman said: ''We will be contesting Mrs
Cunningham's claim and briefing counsel.''

THE death of Olympic road race champion Fabio Casartelli after a crash
in the mountains overshadowed the fifteenth stage of the Tour de France
yesterday.
The toughest stage in the Pyrenees was won by Richard Virenque, of
France, but the cycling festival was marred by the third death of a
rider in the Tour's 92-year history.
Olympic road race champion Casartelli, an Italian with the American
Motorola team, died after receiving severe head injuries when he fell
with a group of riders on the descent from the Col de Portet d'Aspet,
the first climb of the day, 34 kilometres into the 206-km ride from St
Girons.
Casartelli, who was married and had a four-month-old son, was the
Olympic champion in the road race at the 1992 Barcelona Games. He had
just turned 25 on Sunday.
Casartelli, German Dirk Baldinger of the Polti team, Italy's Dante
Rezze, and a few others crashed during the descent. At speeds
approaching 55mph, the riders failed to negotiate a curve and fell.
Rezze and Baldinger were taken to hospital. Rezze injured his left
thigh, while Baldinger suffered multiple injuries including a broken
hip-bone.
The stage had six major climbs during the day. Virenque took the lead
early on, staged a brilliant solo breakaway over four mountain peaks,
and held a 1min 17sec advantage at the end over Italy's Claudio
Chiappucci.
Colombian Hernan Buenahora finished third and race leader Miguel
Indurain, of Spain, retained the yellow jersey after placing sixth.
Indurain, seeking his fifth consecutive Tour victory, made a move at
the end of the stage to finish 2-34 behind, and held on to a 2-44 margin
overall over Swiss Alex Zuelle, who finished in the same time.
Tour organisers said one minute's silence would be observed before the
start of today's sixteenth stage from Tarbes to Pau, 237km (147 miles).
However, organisers came under fire for the way they handled the
aftermath. Swiss Tony Rominger criticised them for not telling the
riders until the stage had finished. Five-times former Tour winner Eddy
Merckx, of Belgium, rapped the organisers for not cancelling the victory
ceremonies.
French television ended its coverage of yesterday's stage showing
Casartelli crossing the finish line in his 1992 Olympic victory, and on
the medal podium with cheers of ''Fabio! Fabio!'' in the background.

Conrad Wilson witnesses an enthralling Schubert performance and argues
that it must come to Edinburgh
SCHUBERT's 200th birthday approaches, along with the centenary of
Brahms's death, both conveniently coinciding with the fiftieth
anniversary of the Edinburgh Festival in 1997. No doubt Brian McMaster
is already forming his plans for that bumper occasion. Even this year
Schubert (though not yet Brahms) is in the air, with a whole series of
sonata and song recitals at the Usher Hall, plus six of his symphonies.
Most of Schubert's substantial output -- if not quite all of his
600-or-so songs or his vast quantity of choral pieces -- can now be
tracked down by listeners with an ear for his music. The nettles that
few performers want to grasp are his many operas. Are they to be
championed in 1997 or abandoned as a lost cause? What we generally
encounter are half-hearted performances, presented on the understanding
that ''these works are not really worth doing but let's give them a try
anyway''.
This is simply not good enough. If Schubert's operas are to be
vindicated, as several of them deserve, they need to be presented, at
whatever the cost, with all the artifice and experience that can be
lavished upon them.
To do what Edinburgh did in a previous Schubert year is thus no longer
acceptable. On that occasion -- the mixing of Schubert with Britten in
1968 -- Alexander Gibson and the Scottish National Orchestra were
invited to finish the festival with a concert performance of Alfonso and
Estrella, a good work, with rather more than curiosity value. A starry
cast was assembled. The full resources of the Edinburgh Festival Chorus
were at the ready.
The performance was sympathetically conducted. But because the sheer
scale of the music was underestimated, the evening seriously overran.
The late-night jollity of a Hoffnung memorial concert, filled with his
vacuum cleaner and other spoofs, had to be delayed. While musical
jokesters were gathering noisily in the corridors and the green room,
Sir Alexander went on doggedly conducting. A Monty Python-like
confrontation was narrowly averted.
Such is the fate of Schubert's operas. Nobody disputes that they are
the work of a genius. But like Haydn's and Vivaldi's operas, they are
the work of a genius with insufficient theatrical instinct. Their lack
of dramatic pace outweighs the wonderful music they contain. They do
nothing that the song cycles, Die schone Mullerin and Winterreise, do
not do more succinctly, more vividly, and with infinitely greater flair.
That, at any rate, is the theory. But this year the Florence Maggio
Musicale has swept it aside with a performance of Schubert's Fierrabras
distinguished enough to establish it as the masterpiece it is. The
omens, admittedly, were inauspicious. The director was Luca Ronconi,
whose way with rare operas is usually to take them by the scruff of the
neck and shake them sensationally into something other than they really
are. And Semyon Bychkov has never been, let us say, the most sensitive
of conductors when it comes to making a case for a work that calls for
loving care. The news that the performance was not expected to end
before midnight seemed just one more deterrent factor.
Yet against all the odds the evening worked. Though the story, of
clanking knights and romantic encounters in the time of Charlemagne,
seemed to have little to commend it, Ronconi risked updating it to the
composer's own lifetime. For once the device seemed justified.
Fierrabras could be recognised as a vital link in the chain between
Beethoven and Wagner, and thereby emerged as an enthralling study of
Viennese operatic life and thought in the year 1823.
It was, moreover, quite ravishingly staged. The arias, which could
have been intended for the choicest of song cycles, were moments of high
beauty. The setting of spoken words against music, which Mozart had
tried and abandoned in Zaide (also performed at Florence this year in a
new arrangement by Luciano Berio), was wholly convincing. The ensembles
and choruses showed Schubert to be no fool when it came to planting them
in an operatic context.
That Fierrabras is a long, leisurely, and copious score could not be
denied. That it requires Brucknerian patience of its audience is equally
obvious. But when adroitly performed, and when cash is on hand to
present it properly, its rewards are manifest. Again and again the
Florentine production yielded details that arrested the attention and
stuck in the memory.
The smoothly sliding panels of Margherita Palli's decor, the
exquisitely soft lighting, and the prancing horses -- witty facsimiles
of the sculptures seen in many an Italian piazza -- conspired to keep
things flowing. The cast contained no star names, but when midnight
arrived one wanted more.
Productions as good as this, especially when they revitalise neglected
operas, deserve to go the rounds. Florence last year borrowed Luc
Bondy's brilliant Salzburg staging of Strauss's Salome, which moved on
this year to Covent Garden. There would be no point, for the sake of
exclusivity, in staging a rival Fierrabras when something so fine exists
in Italy.
The answer, then, is for other festivals to import it. Edinburgh,
which seldom originates its own opera productions, is adept at importing
good things. Last year there was Britten from Sydney. This year there
will be Rimsky-Korsakov from Leningrad. Brian McMaster, a champion of
Weber, admires German opera of the Fierrabras period. To bring Ronconi
-- whose production of Orlando Furioso in Peter Diamand's time has gone
down in the annals -- back to Edinburgh could be greatly in the
festival's interests, but more than that in Schubert's.

THE thousands of golf fans expected to head for St Andrews for the
four-day Open Championship are being urged by police not to attempt any
shortcuts.
An added request -- please spare a thought for officers handling the
flood of traffic.
The message from Inspector Jim Rodden, of Fife police, is: ''Follow
the signs.''
He added that a number of traffic plans had been formulated over the
past few months to get golf enthusiasts to St Andrews safely and
effectively.
''Drivers will find life much easier if they follow the signposted
routes, instead of taking the routes they think they know. That merely
could see them ending up in bottlenecks.''
Inspector Rodden said that there were advanced ticket sales of more
than 45,000 on Championship days -- figures similar to the last open
there in 1990. It amounts to more than 12,000 cars each day.
He said that spectators should be aware of the Golf Link rail service
from mainline stations to Leuchars, from where coaches with police
escorts will take people to the course.
The inspector also admitted that there was bound to be some delays,
but he asked drivers to be patient. ''I would also ask people to give
those officers on points duty for many hours a day a smile. It's often
demoralising just watching hundreds of cars go past.''
More than 100 police officers will be on duty for the event, said the
inspector, who also advised motorists to make life difficult for
criminals by not leaving valuables in their cars.
''There will always be a minority who come here seeking opportunities
to steal. Leaving items in the car is an open invitation.''
Inspector Rodden also warned people not to bring pets with them.
''They can't take them out on the course and if we see any animal in
distress we will take whatever action is necessary.''
Motorists can expect peak-time delays on the A8000 linking Newbridge
roundabout on the west side of Edinburgh with the Forth road bridge
because of roadworks.
Hotel and other accommodation in St Andrews is well booked up. The
closest vacancies still available, according to a local tourism officer,
are at least 15 minutes' drive away.
''Companies have taken up most of the accommodation in the big hotels,
but they are always worth trying in case vacancies arise through parties
not turning up in full,'' she said.
''The train will be a good way for people to travel. There are
specials from all over Scotland, meeting up with the bus link from
Leuchars.''
For those who insist on driving, a massive park-and-ride area has been
created in fields at Guardbridge, about three-quarters-of-a-mile from
the action.
Tickets providing parking close to the course for all four days are
sold out, but there will be spaces on a daily basis for those who arrive
early enough.
Last time around at the Open Championship at St Andrews, won by
Englishman Nick Faldo, the record books were re-written time and again.
They included equal low rounds, best nine holes, but most remarkable
of all was the number of people who attended -- well over 200,000
compared with 193,126 at St Andrews in 1984.
At the end of the event Faldo described St Andrews as a wonderful town
and said that in Open Week ''it just buzzes with excitement.''
Over the next few days Fife police hope for as little excitement as
possible in traffic movements. They are looking for incident free roads,
and, of course, that smile.

C'MON REF, that was surely a foul. This adaptation of Nick Hornby's
best-selling dissection of football fanaticism has been thrilling
theatre audiences, and critics, for almost two years now, but judging by
this performance it's no longer fresh on its feet.
Structurally it's sound, with adaptor Paul Hodson (who also produces
and directs this Brighton Theatre Events production) retaining Hornby's
distinctive narrative voice -- quasi-philosophical musings which veer
from impassioned joy to depressive meanderings -- and making dramatic
sense of the book's jumbled chronology of match fixtures, club
personalities, and real-life experiences by setting them within the
confessional framework of a therapy session, signalled by a harsh single
spotlight.
However, as a one-man show the performance is all, and Robin Hodson's
was seriously offside, admissions to his therapist like ''I know it's
boring'' lacking the necessary irony.
Hornby's book documents the most trivial of football trivia but
enthralls even the most uninitiated, like myself, because of its
bitter-sweet exact analysis of obsession. The success of this show
hinges on an ability to convey this bizarre absorption with Arsenal
Football Club, but Hodson's performance, while committed and energetic,
betrayed serious inadequacies in tonality, timing, and convincing
characterisation.
A few scenarios were lively enough, eg, Hodson projecting comic menace
as a Satan dealing a swap of Arsenal victory in the cup final for Tory
victory in the General Election.

I FIRST saw this Liz Lochhead two-hander a few years back in a
production that starred the writer herself. Maybe it's me, or maybe it's
the rewrite she did last year, but it now seems to be an altogether more
substantial piece.
It must be said it was always well received by audiences. As it
alternates between two monologues -- one, Derek, an oil worker taking
the Aberdeen to Glasgow train; the other, Verena, his wife filling her
time with family dramas and shopping sprees -- Lochhead displays her
sharp ear for language and fine eye for comical detail.Although it would
be wrong to draw too close a parallel to the work of Alan Bennett
(Lochhead's characters are rather more self-aware), Lochhead is just as
capable of getting a laugh out of a well-placed phrase like ''Crimplene
trousers''. And the early scenes, involving a perfectly-pitched Carolyn
Bonnyman as Verena, are a half-ironic, half-straight homage to the cult
of consumerism.
The standard of this observation can waver, though as often as not it
is razor sharp, but what really stands out is the subtlety of the
characterisation, particularly in the part of Derek. Performed with
range and understanding by Lewis Howden, Derek may start off as the
boorish train passenger going heavy on the bevy, but he emerges as a man
if not of sensitivity then certainly of some tenderness.
More moving still is Verena's parallel exposure of a vulnerable human
surface beneath the brusque Glasgow patter as the edifice of consumer
culture collapses to reveal the emptiness of a childless marriage that
is as emotionally fractured as it is physically distant.

THE tangled situation which surrounds Hearts and their manager, Tommy
McLean, is a symptom of the ills which presently beset Scottish football
-- Rangers apart.
The Ibrox men are the solitary premier division team who have been
able to splash out any significant sums in the transfer market so far.
Paul Gascoigne, in case anyone has not noticed, has joined up for #4.3m
and Stephen Wright has arrived from Aberdeen for a fee which will be set
by a transfer tribunal, but one which will almost certainly push the
champions' summer spending close to #6m.
So far, their rivals appear to have spent just a fraction of that --
and the gap grows wider and wider.
* Motherwell have bought John Hendry from Spurs for #200,000.
* Raith Rovers have paid Dundee United #100,000 for veteran Jim
McInally.
As for the others -- nothing.
Celtic have tried and failed. Repeatedly.
Hibs and Hearts simply cannot afford to move for quality players this
summer.
And Falkirk and Kilmarnock, who both spent considerable sums last
year, have gone quiet.
So, too, have Aberdeen, and there is no guarantee that manager Roy
Aitken will get all the money the club will receive for Wright when the
tribunal reaches a verdict.
Then there's Partick Thistle, but not even their Intertoto Cup
exploits will not enable John Lambie to leap into the market place to
spend anything more than a modest sum.
The losers in all of this are the fans -- again, Rangers apart.
At Ibrox, the support knows that each summer money will be spent and
chairman David Murray has confirmed that time and again.
Last week, when Gascoigne arrived, it was significant that Murray
explained: ''We have to keep changing the menu. We cannot serve up the
same stuff to the fans every season. We have to make changes.''
Murray has recognised what the Italian giants took on board as policy
many years ago: keep the customer satisfied.
The need for the public today is for new faces, for fresh stars -- and
at Ibrox they are paraded each summer.
Most succeed in capturing the imagination of the adoring Ibrox
support. Others, such as Basile Boli, flop.
But, always, the menu will change and the people will buy season
tickets, and Rangers will grow ever more powerful.
The reason for that is not simply the size of the support the
champions have. It has its roots in other times when previous regimes
were in control, and Willie Waddell was enough of a visionary to put
seats into Ibrox when few others saw the need for change.
I can remember Waddell saying: ''I told Desmond White (then chairman
of Celtic) that he had to pu in seats, otherwise he would miss the bus.
''He kept saying that his club's fans preferred to stand.''
Celtic missed that bus, and the Taylor Report decreed that supporters
would sit whether they liked to or not. Now, the Parkhead side are among
the clubs being hamstrung by the cost of a new stadium.
When you look around Scottish football you see clubs crippled by
building costs, unable to set up a credible on-field challenge to
Rangers.
One premier division manager admitted yesterday: ''When you exmaine
the costs which the various clubs have run up in conforming to the
Taylor Report it points out the difference between Rangers and the rest.
''They have a stadium and can concentrate on putting a top team on the
park.
''Look at transfers in the premier division this year and you'll see
what I'm talking about.
''Rangers are always expected to spend more than the rest put
together, but this year the gulf is enormous. And it will grow if
Rangers qualify for the Champions' League, which we expect to happen.
''It might be the turn of the century before the other clubs can be
free of overdrafts, caused by the rebuilding of grounds. Only then can
they look at the playing side and spend the money there.
''At the moment, for most of us, the future is bleak.''
There may be a late spurt from Celtic as they try to keep up with
their rivals on the other side of the city. Manager Tommy Burns might
still land the type of player he has been searching for, but, at other
clubs across the country, supporters need not expect too much.
In fact, they need not expect anything apart from a new seat in a new
stand in a new stadium.
A stadium which has, most likely, crippled their club until, as my
manager friend told me, the turn of the century.
That may not be the most edifying prospect for thousands of fans and
they will take little consolation from the fact that they are sitting
comfortably as they are forced to watch the equivalent of a television
repeat.

IT WAS a Saturday, the venue was Muirfield 15 years ago. It was one of
those days which because of a happening or an announcement, tend to
linger long in the memory.
Arnold Palmer, who was only two months away from his fifty-first
birthday, strolled into view and told the world's media that this could
be his last Open Championship.
Everything else was put on hold. ''End of an era'' stories were
clattered out and the golfer whose presence 20 years earlier had revived
an event at precisely the time it needed reviving disappeared for a time
under a mountain of praise.
Of course, it did not prove to be the great one's farewell appearance
because he came back to play the Open 12 months later. Unable to let go,
but always welcome, he has returned six more times since.
He is back again, but this time, we are told, it really is the end. St
Andrews will be Palmer's final swing.
The rules of the Open have been changed to give the 65-year-old one
last hurrah at the course where he made his debut in 1960, and it will
be an emotional time for him and those who follow him.
It was like a trip down memory lane yesterday when Palmer was among
the four legendary names in American golf who assembled at St Andrews
for a spot of practice for the Open. Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson,
and Raymond Floyd went out together shortly before 10am, watched by an
appreciative crowd.
Palmer launched a drive straight down the middle at the first and set
off at a brisk pace, followed by his faithful Scottish caddie Tip
Anderson. It was all so familiar, the up-beat mood of the quartet set
the tone, and the crowd loved it.
Sadly, Anderson, who has been with Palmer at the Open since 1960 but
at present is struggling with a leg-muscle problem, had to give up on
the eleventh hole yesterday. For the rest of the round the bag was
carried by American Wayne Beck, who was already booked to be Palmer's
caddie in the British Seniors Open at Portrush next week.
It is not merely a place in the game's history that Palmer has; it is
a whole high-ceilinged hall the size of a golf course.
Every sport has its giants, naturals who bestride time and change and
attitudes, those whose greatness can never fade. In boxing there is Ali;
football has Pele; tennis rejoices in Perry. Golf has Palmer.
No-one doubts the importance of Palmer to his sport and the leading
players are all fully paid-up members of the large band of followers
known as ''Arnie's Army'' who will walk with him again this week.
The current Masters champion, Ben Crenshaw, is still in awe and says:
''When I was 10 I attended my first professional tournament, the Texas
Open at San Antonio. Arnold had won it the two previous years and he won
it again that time.
''I remember his massive arms and a No.2-iron shot that I thought was
out of this world. It was unbelievably exciting and, apart from his
golf, he had a personal magnetism all of his own. He still does.
Everybody was carried along in his wake.
''Watching him play his last US Open last year was an experience I
won't forget. It got to him and it got to a lot of people.
''Many Americans know what a great effort he made in coming over to
the British Open originally. He felt very strongly about it and did all
he could for the event. It sparked off a lot more interest in the
championship.''
Palmer, winner of two of the three previous Masters, finished second
to Kel Nagle in his first Open and won the next two, but it was his
swashbuckling style as much as results that made him the role model for
everyone who aspired to greatness.
''As a kid I went to see him play in San Diego a few times, and yes, I
was part of the Army,'' said Craig Stadler, who also succeeded Palmer as
a Masters champion. ''You never had any trouble finding Arnie on a
course. There were a few scattered spectators and then there was the
throng, and you knew that's where he was.
''It was an inspiring sight and I tried to follow his 'all or nothing'
style, because I've never been one who liked laying up. He influenced me
more than anyone and I feel very honoured to call him a friend.
''Arnold is the game and will, I think, remain the game.''
South African Gary Player, who with Palmer and Nicklaus formed the
''Big Three'' in the 1960s, paid tribute in his book To Be The Best. In
it he wrote: ''I first saw Arnold in 1957. It was my first visit to the
United States and I just stood on the practice range and watched him in
awe.
''I had never seen the ball hit with such power. Nor had I seen such a
strong pair of hands. His grip on the club was the best: those huge
wrists and forearms gave him such immense power. I used to joke that
when he hit the ball I saw sparks coming off the grass.
''Irrespective of money and success, we liked being together. What we
had was an intense rivalry balanced by an enormous respect for one
another as men and as players. We always accepted that we wanted to beat
the hell out of each other on the course and would play as hard and as
tough as we could, but whatever the outcome it was all left there on the
last green.
''I learnt much from Arnold, not only about golf, but more about the
responsibilities that are part of being a public hero. He is a man who
always acknowledged his duty to his fans.
''I have watched him come off the course after scoring an 80 and an
hour later he was still standing there signing autographs. That is a
measure of his enormous patience and also a reflection of his great
importance to American sports fans, who to this day, I suspect, would
still prefer to watch Arnie shoot 80 than somebody else score in the low
60s.
''In fact, nobody really cares about the score. They want to see this
man for what he is -- their hero. He loves playing golf much more than
Jack and I ever will do.''
For Nick Faldo it was Nicklaus's victory in the 1972 Masters that
kick-started his own golf career, but he has since come to know and
experience the esteem in which Palmer is held. ''I played with him in
the par-3 competition at Augusta one year and I will always remember the
reaction of a woman spectator,'' says Faldo.
''She asked for an autograph as we passed, but he simply couldn't sign
for everybody and said sorry. She turned to her friend. 'He said no to
me,' she said, thrilled to bits. I'll never forget that.''
Palmer's Open farewell promises to be pretty unforgettable, too.
Truly, the end of an era.
I remember his massive arms and a No.2-iron shot that I thought was
out of this world. It was unbelievably exciting and, apart from his
golf, he had a personal magnetism all of his own. He still does. - BEN

THE official inquiry into the collapse of Barings, Britain's oldest
merchant bank, makes sad reading. There was no evidence of any vast
conspiracy, though the sums involved were staggering, and no obvious
hole in official regulatory systems. The culprits were, as they seemed
at the start, Barings' chief Singapore trader, Mr Nick Leeson, and the
company's top management which appointed him and should have supervised
his operations. Mr Leeson's precise motives could not be identified by
the investigators, which does leave open the question that he may have
acted maliciously; but the simplest and most direct explanation, that he
gambled and went on increasing his stake as he lost, is convincing. Only
new evidence which might emerge at Mr Leeson's trial, when its venue has
eventually been established, will disturb that picture. The sort of
trading in which he was engaged demands a gambler's nerve and huge
reserves, but even hundreds of millions of reserves were insufficient to
sustain his operations which were in the red from early in his
appointment. That none of this was detected by his superiors is an
astonishing indictment, even making every allowance for his deception
and clever concealment. The fact that he was in charge of the bank's
paper work concerning the details of his own daily operations was an
astonishing lapse of managerial responsibility, and a most unusual one.
Had that not been the case, the real nature of his activities could
probably not have been hidden for long.
Barings' management is exposed as being either remarkably arrogant or
ignorant about the conduct of its own business in spite of the apparent
rewards being so substantial. The investigators found that it failed to
follow up warning signals which, in retrospect at least, were clear
enough. That failure highlights one of the problems of financial
regulation and control: everything depends on those who read the
evidence as it is presented. The Barings' managers with responsibility
for their Singapore subsidiary seem to have suspended their capacity for
disbelief, something essential to the theatre but fatal to running a
money business: Mr Leeson was making losses all the time but declaring
profits all the same by systematic false accounting. The inquiry's
report does make some recommendations for improvement in the supervision
of banks involved in securities dealings, but because of the purely
personal dimensions of Mr Leeson's duplicity and his managers'
inadequacy, no fundamental changes are required in existing supervisory
procedures. And although the Bank of England does not emerge entirely
unscathed (and one of its officials has already resigned) the report's
conclusion is really very firm in absolving it from any material charge:
it says that although its performance ''could have been better'', there
was no way in which the bank could have prevented Barings' collapse.
It does seem unlikely that any new legal or administrative
arrangements can guarantee that such a long-running and massive fraud
will never be perpetrated against a financial company in the future. But
the same combination of lax control and opportunity to deceive is hardly
likely to reccur. Financial businesses will be even more anxious to
separate dealers from the records of their work; and superiors will
scrutinise large deals and exceptional profits with even more scepticism
than before; but only a bold, or very naive, man will believe that
''big'' money can be entirely protected from the risk of greed and
deception. That was always true and nothing in the latest findings at
Barings disturbs it.

THIS week the West must decide what to do about Bosnia. It does not
take a military or political genius to discern the options. Total
withdrawal or a descent into Europe's Vietnam. Discredited peacekeeping
or aggressive peacemaking. Or again -- the most likely outcome of
Friday's London summit of the nations with most at stake -- a messy
compromise. The repellent triumphalism of the gloating Bosnian Serbs is
a powerful excuse for going to war on behalf of Bosnia's other people if
for no other reason than the defence of civilised values. ''We want to
do right by the people of Bosnia,'' Mr Rifkind said this week while
still resisting the tempting, simplistic solutions of the American
Republicans who really believe that lifting the arms embargo against the
Muslims will finally cure a cultural wound which has flared and settled
and flared again for most of the twentieth century. He is correct to say
warfare will not resolve the tragedy. If only it were that simple. Mr
Rifkind has a terrible responsibility on his shoulders this week -- only
his second as British Foreign Secretary -- as he prepares to chair the
talks. On one side he has the American right determined and strong
enough to sweep aside resistance from the more cautious Clinton
administration. Senator Dole and his supporters are joined, in some
measure, by the French who are itching -- or giving that impression --
to use more force to save what is left from Bosnian Serb aggression. On
his other flank Mr Rifkind finds the sullen Russians, weary of Serb
fanaticism but not yet prepared to let the West have a completely free
military hand. These options are not all mutually exclusive. For
example, a lifting of the arms embargo would immediately require the
withdrawal of UN protection forces -- and probably the injection of
thousands of American troops to aid an evacuation. A hasty withdrawal
now -- the ultimate admission of European failure -- would leave
Bosnia's innocents at the mercy of the Serbs long before the necessary
heavy armaments could be flown in to let them dig in defences. Those who
see a military defeat of the Bosnian Serbs as essential to peace should
contemplate some brutal truths. The Serbs are one of the toughest
fighting machines in the world. Tito's inheritors -- mainly Serbia --
wanted and believe they got a military capability sufficient to ward off
aggression from Nato and the Warsaw Pact simultaneously, at least for a
period. They are experts in a dirty war. If the West quit its
peacekeeping role now in disarray and diplomatic defeat, leaving
Bosnia's fate to be settled by a free-for-all, the Russians would
probably arm the Serbs in the same way that the West would arm the
Muslims and the Germans would arm the Croatians. Sarajevo would become
Europe's Saigon.
There is a better way. Inevitably it is also the most difficult and
probably the most dangerous from the West's standpoint. It is to
continue working for a negotiated political settlement while increasing
the level of protection for ''safe'' areas like Sarajevo and Gorazde and
some of the others for which the Bosnian Serbs have unjustifiable
territorial ambitions. Another effort needs to be made to swell the
international peacekeeping presence. President Clinton could provide
troops -- but probably won't -- preferring to view Bosnia as Europe's
problem. The fact that Europe is incapable of dealing with it is plain,
but critics should remember this is also now Nato's affair. That means
American involvement of some kind is unavoidable, especially if the UN
protection effort is to be increased. ''This far and no farther,''
should be Europe's policy now. It might not be populist. Indeed it might
not work. But at least it would be the decent and proper thing. The
alternative is unconscionable.

Ross Finlay delights in Saab reaching greater heights than ever
AS happens with many manufacturers, Saab has one model range which is
newer and attracts most of the attention, and another which has been
soldiering away for a longer time. The current 900 range was the first
product of the present Swedish/American ownership, while the 9000,
introduced in 1984 and recently freshened up, dates back to the previous
all-Swedish regime.
Saab was formed in 1937 as an aircraft company, because the Swedish
government saw that trouble was coming in Europe, and wanted its own
independent warplane manufacturer. After the war, Saab took the really
brave decision to move into cars, despite the fact that, of its hundreds
of employees, not a single one knew anything about building or selling
the things.
It nevertheless managed to create its own industry niche.
Saab's links with the aircraft business have made its engineers very
keen on using the best possible materials. They are extremely safety
conscious, they have nothing to learn about aerodynamics and, although
they sometimes seem a little on the sombre side, show them an engine and
they are usually able to find some excuse to hot it up.
The 9000 is available either as a CS five-door or a CD four-door
saloon, far roomier than most of its rivals, with boot capacity and, in
particular, rear passenger space which make the others look as if they
are joking. Compared with the German opposition, it is, model for model,
better equipped.
All 9000s, even the entry-level two-litre CD at #17,995, have
anti-lock brakes, twin airbags, power-assisted steering, heat-absorbent
glass, heated front seats, pollen-filtered ventilation and headlamp
wash/wipe as standard. There are also option packs and the usual range
of individual extra-cost items.
Using balancer-shaft technology, the four-cylinder engines rev very
smoothly. The base-model two-litre offers 130bhp, the light-pressure
turbo Ecopower version has 150bhp in its two-litre size, 170bhp as a
2.3, and the full-pressure 2.3 turbo peaks at 200bhp.
Sporting flagship of the range at #29,995, the 2.3 Aero goes as high
as 225bhp, an amount of power flowing through the front wheels which
needs watching, especially as the peak of the torque curve is away up at
252lb ft. The Aero sprints to 60mph in under seven seconds, and its
mid-range overtaking performance is staggering.
At the same price, the Griffin uses the GM three-litre V6 engine
remapped by Saab. It is a fully equipped 210bhp saloon which still
manages a strong performance although the power is delivered less
abruptly.
I thought the base-model two-litre CD in its current form has been
usefully refreshed. It has the familiar very spacious body, a dullish
fascia which could do with being modernised but is certainly well enough
stocked, and a ''plip'' remote control central locking release which
works from an amazing distance away.
The 9000 has a notably robust safety cage, and there are carefully
designed crumple zones front and rear. While the last two-litre I drove
felt a bit of a plodder, this one seemed livelier and, thanks to the
balancer-shaft engine, much smoother.
Saab considers sporting gearchanges a little too frivolous, but the
example in the test car was less stodgy than earlier examples, at least
if not heaved around. Swedish cars usually soak up poor surfaces, and
the 9000 remained stable when being rushed over some side roads showing
signs of slumping into the peat bog underneath.
In terms of handling, nothing can disguise the fact that design has
moved on since the 9000's suspension was originally put in place, and
there is a limit to what can be achieved by fine-tuning. But it was a
pleasant and comfortable car to drive around, reaching 60mph from rest
in 11 seconds, with consumption returns like 40mpg at 56mph, 34 at 75
and 22mpg in city traffic. It may be an old-stager, but the 9000 still
holds its own, especially when you compare equipment levels with
showroom prices.

'This is the championship and course
for the big boys. A 100-1 shot,
as Wayne Riley was in the Scottish
Open last week, is not on.'
IF THE quality of Open winners unearthed so far at St Andrews is to be
continued, then threequarters of the chaps lining up on Thursday are
playing for the places. Since the end of World War II, the list of the
men who have triumphed at the golfing Holy of Holies is inclined to
bring about bowing of heads by those who revere the masters of this most
difficult of sports.
Among them are Bobby Locke, the South African about whom legends have
been spun for some years, winner in 1957; Tony Lema, the American who
defied all known Old Course rationale by winning the championship on his
one and only visit there in 1964; Sam Snead, considered by many as the
finest swinger of a golf club ever seen, who won in 1946; Jack Nicklaus,
about whom there are no superlatives left to use, won it twice, in 1970
and 78; and modern giants Seve Ballesteros in 1984 and Nick Faldo in
1990.
Have a glance through the field for the 124th Open and judge who you
think would fit comfortably among those names. Not too many, I would
suggest. That does not mean there will not be a worthy, however less
exalted, champion this week. Anybody who gets through four rounds on the
Old Course ahead of the best golfers in the world is entitled to be
considered extraordinary himself.
None the less, I suspect we might be wasting much needed study time by
considering outsiders too seriously. This is the championship and course
for the big boys. A 100-1 shot, as Wayne Riley was in the Scottish Open
last week, is not on.
Faldo has to be the first name to trip off the tongue. However he has
been playing in the earlier part of the year, Faldo, like a well trained
Derby runner, gets his game and mental attitude at its peak for this
title. His record in the championship is remarkable. In the last 10
Opens, he has finished in the top 10 seven times, winning it twice. He
has not missed the cut in the last 19 years.
Those statistics entitle him to be strongly fancied, but the fact that
he showed at Carnoustie last week that he is truly back on form makes
him, at least for me, the one they all have to beat.
He loves the course, gets great backing from the Scottish crowd, and
it is just about time for him to add his first major since he took the
Open at Muirfield in 1992.
The main challengers would have to consist of the obvious, too. Nick
Price, winner of everything bar the lottery last year, including this
championship at Turnberry, has had a hard time adjusting to the hectic
schedule such success brings, but there have been signs that he is
getting his game going again. Tom Watson, in 1982-83, was the last man
to bring off successive victories, however, and that may work against
the player often described as the nicest man in golf.
Greg Norman can never be left out of any major title consideration. It
may be the case that he should have won more than he has (two Opens) and
has suffered some extraordinary bad luck, but he is a magnificent player
who can handle any conditions.
He is the current world's No.1, has played well this year and by one
of those peculiar coincidences, he has finished tied in sixth place at
the Old Course in both 1984 and 1990.
Bernhard Langer and Colin Montgomerie vie as the two best players who
have not won this championship. Monty, apart from putting problems, is
playing as well, if not better, than anybody in the world and is long
overdue the major win his immense talent deserves. He did everything but
putt brilliantly at Carnoustie last week and, at this level, putting can
suddenly seem easy again. If that happens, the crowds that will flock to
the Fife coast can look out for a great Scottish challenge.
Langer, unlike Montgomerie, has known the joy of major victory, having
won the US Masters twice. He leades the European Order of Merit this
year, came closer to winning the Open at this course in 1984 when he
finished tied for second spot, and will be refreshed and ready after a
rest last week.
If you add US Open winner Corey Pavin, who likes the British golf
challenge, and the enormously talented South African Ernie Els, you
might well have covered the seven to take against the field.
On the other hand, it would not need a great deal for Ian Woosnam to
get in among the leaders, while Phil Mickleson, the left handed
American, might do rather well. Sandy Lyle looks to me a decent each way
bet (66-1 in some places) and New Zealander Michael Campbell is in very
good form.
I like Langer -- if only because this is a good sporting summer for
Germany, with Steffi Graf doing her usual bit at Wimbledon and Boris
Becker reaching the men's final.

NEVER a company to do anything by halves, Miller Homes recently opened
the doors of not one, but two, new showhomes at the new Dalnottar Park
development in Old Kilpatrick.
The three-bedroom Falkland comes with a lounge, separate dining room,
kitchen/utility room, bathroom, cloakroom, en-suite shower room, and
garage.
The new Blair was designed and developed by Miller Homes and built
specifically with the Scottish market in mind.
The four-bedroom detached house consists of a lounge, dining-room,
kitchen, cloakroom, en-suite shower room and garage. Marie Cochrane, of
The Interior View, who was responsible for interior decoration, says:
''We have created a luxurious feel with the Blair showhome, with a lot
of soft green wall coverings and oak furniture creating a homely
atmosphere.''
''The Falkland has a very stylish feel to it with lots of fresh pinks
and oranges which complement a very contemporary house design.''
Dalnottar Park will have a wide variety of new homes to choose from,
including the three bedroom detached Oban with lounge, separate dining
room, kitchen, en-suite shower room and garage.
Lindsay Gilchrist, sales manager for Miller Homes in the West of
Scotland, says: ''We are building only 31 new homes at Dalnottar Park.
We are giving our prospective buyers a wide choice of home with six
types to choose from.
''We have a package of special offers, including part-exchange, a
3.99% fixed mortgage rate, three years' mortgage protection insurance,
no estate agency fees and #500 towards advertising costs.''
''Quite honestly, there's never been a better time to buy a new Miller
home.''
Prices at Dalnottar Park range from #84,500 for the three-bedroom
detached Oban to #115,000 for the four-bedroom detached Melrose.

THE Scottish dairy industry could face up to a major row today when
Scottish Milk, the successor to the Scottish Milk Marketing Board, holds
its first annual meeting and appoints a new chairman, writes ROY GREGOR.
The on-going dispute among milk producers about the future of Scottish
Pride, which holds its annual general meeting later this month, and is a
major customer of the producers' own marketing set-up, has been
aggravated by the apparent intervention of the Scottish Farmers' Union
which has advised its members not to back dissenting shareholders who
want to know more about Scottish Pride's shareholders and their share
dealings.
Scottish NFU president John Ross has now circulated all milk producer
members saying the minority shareholders' group has failed to show why
they are in a position to challenge the capabilities of Scottish Pride.
However, Michael McCreath from Newton Stewart said yesterday: ''The
SFU is out of order to try and impose its advice.''

<HEADLINE>Initial cost to farmers will be modest. Levy to be phased in on farm-saved seed</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977322164</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE long argument over at which level plant breeders should levy
farmers who use farm-saved seed is at an end following the announcement
that the full rate of 70% of the royalty on certified seed is to be
phased in over three years.
The initial cost, however, to farmers will be modest since two-thirds
of the varieties on the recommended lists do not have European Union
plant rights and are exempt.
Outlining the need for this levy, Tony Hayton of the British Society
of Plant Breeders said: ''It is necessary to recompense breeders for
years of investment and to protect the intellectual property we have in
varieties. The main purpose of the levy is to allow continuing
investment in a vigorous plant breeding industry.''
Bringing a new cereal variety to the market can take as long as 15
years and even then the odds against producing a successful new strain
are stacked against the breeder. During the last decade there has been a
rapid increase in the use of farm saved seed.
This year it is estimated that 35% of the cereal seed drilled in the
UK is farm saved against 30% last year. On the Continent the figures are
much higher with Spanish farmers heading the league at 85%.
Virtually the whole range of farm crops is covered by the new EU
regulations but no varieties introduced before September 1, 1994 are
included in the list, and farmers who can show that they have saved and
drilled seed of a protected variety before that same date will be exempt
until June 30th, 2001.
In practical terms farmers will receive a declaration form this
autumn, and provided that they pay the relevant dues by Jan 14, 1996,
they will be charged at 50% of the C2 rate. Late payments will be at the
full 70%. The same pattern will follow for spring crops and then next
autumn the rate will move up to 60% with the full 70% coming in with
winter crops in 1997.
Contractors who treat seed for farmers will also be asked to keep
records as a cross reference for the BSPB who will administer the
scheme. The cost to farmers will initially be no more than #2 per acre
on those winter wheat varieties carrying a high C2 levy.
In the first year it is hoped to raise an estimated #1m which compares
with the #19m currently raised from the levies on certified seed.
Eventually by 2001 it is hoped to raise #4m from farmers as new
varieties are phased in. Answering criticisms that certified cereal seed
is overpriced Mr Hayton said: ''Ten years ago a new variety was costing
#400 per tonne -- today it's nearer #200 due to competition between the
seed houses. It is very difficult to sustain improvements at that level
and our view is that certified seed is good value for money.''
The success of the scheme depends totally on farmers' honesty and
co-operation. The BSPB believes that the levy will be accepted,
especially when growers realise that for wheat it will come to no more
than #7 per hectare compared to the quite normal #40 per hectare spent
on chemicals for the same crop.
* THE Scottish Farmers Union has rejected the levy proposals as
''totally unacceptable''.
Cereals convenor David Jack said the authorities had failed in their
duties to achieve a satisfactoty solution within which European farmers
were seeking a 30% levy.
The union said plant breeders should not be allowed to set levies on
both certified and farm saved seed. The SFU potato committee will be
first to take the matter further at a meeting tomorrow.

MACBETH was not to be vanquished ''until Great Birnam wood to high
Dunsinane hill shall come against him.'' If he had only paused to
consider the views over Dunkeld and Birnam, perhaps he would have been
able to resist the tempting predictions of the witches. He could have
settled into one of Scotland's most picturesque corners and passed up
his ill-fated stab for the crown.
Even the witches would have been charmed by Hillhead of Dunkeld, a
south-facing house set high above the Tay, and overlooking the cathedral
town with views to Strathbraan and Craigvinian Forest. The
Scottish-Victorian mansion house was built about 150 years ago and has
three reception rooms, six bedrooms (each with its own bathroom) and a
separate wing with its own entrance. At the end of the drive, there is a
two-bedroom Gate Lodge with entrance hall and sitting room. Recently
restored, both the house and Lodge are in ''immaculate condition'',
according to the agent, and are available as a whole or in two lots.
The grounds, extending to a little over three acres, consist of lawns
with mature beech, birch and pine trees, a croquet lawn reached by a
stone balustrade and a hard tennis court.
Outbuildings include a garage and timber building with two kennels and
runs.
But whether you visit the area in thunder, lightning or in rain, this
is not Lady Macbeth's damned spot.
''Hillhead of Dunkeld would make a marvellous private house or a small
and exclusive hotel catering perhaps to the sporting market which it
served until recently,'' says Wattie Barbour, the Finlayson Hughes
partner handling the sale.
Dunkeld attracts many tourists to its twelfth-century cathedral,
seventeenth-century Little Houses with their Beatrix Potter connection,
and the nearby Birnam Wood from where (it is said) on a clear day you
can see Dunsinane Hill.
But those who want to buy will have to screw their courage to the
sticking place. Finlayson Hughes is seeking more than #450,000 for
Hillhead of Dunkeld as a whole. Is this an offer I see before me?

PROFESSOR MacFarlane's remarks about universities and ''springs of
knowledge'', at a recent Edinburgh graduation ceremony, cause me to
reflect that one such spring has just dried up.
Students who have previously attended extramural classes arranged by
the Department of Adult and Continuing Education at Glasgow University
have been sent the information that all classes throughout Ayrshire are
to be cancelled, with immediate effect.
It appears the budget to Community Education, Ayr Division, from the
central regional budget, has been cut by 25%. ''Ayr is giving priority
the funding of projects in areas of social need'', and the annual grant
(of around #6800) which was given by Ayr to support university classes
in Ayrshire is being withdrawn, to be used for these other projects.
Extramural classes run by DACE in Lanark and Renfrew, which come under
the same sector of organisation as Ayr, have not had their funding cut.
In DACE's brochure for the session 1994-95 were listed 38 classes held
in 10 different locations throughout Ayrshire. From personal knowledge
of two classes I have attended in Largs, for the past six years, this
will mean around 40+ adults will no longer be able to enjoy mental
stimulation and meeting those with similar interests for two hours each
week.
I do not know what the actual numbers were of those who attended
classes throughout Ayrshire. One class I went to was on the lower limit,
but I believe some of the classes attracted quite a large number of
students. However, it seems there must be approaching 1000 adults in
Ayrshire who will sorely miss their lectures, which have helped keep
their ''grey cells'' active.
I think these classes do fulfil a social need, and hope that Ayr may
yet reconsider its withdrawal of this grant.

THE Scottish Office and the Skye Bridge Company have consistently told
us half-truths and downright lies in order to somehow justify the
totally unjustifiable, ie the imposition of the highest-cost toll bridge
in the world on a fragile economic area which already experiences one of
the highest costs of living in the UK. They are still trying to mislead
us with similar disinformation.
(1) Lord James Douglas-Hamilton stated categorically to the Highland
Regional Council that there would not be a Scottish Office-funded bridge
built in the next 20 years, and only the Design, Build, and Operate
option that we have today could be considered.
Not even this Government lasts 20 years, and after the bridge was
under construction the Scottish Office was challenged on what the
Minister had said, as, if it had waited, European money would have been
available to fund a publicly-built bridge.
The official response from the Scottish Office was that the Minister's
statement to the HRC was a personal point of view and not the
Government's.
(2) For about eight years before the go-ahead for the bridge was
given, Skye and Lochalsh District Council, together with many people
living in Skye, asked for two new ferries and a 24-hour service. The two
existing ferries were incapable of coping with the greatly increased
volume of traffic in the 1980s.
Not until the Bridge Order was signed did the Scottish Office order
and build two new ferries and MacBraynes commenced a 24-hour service.
The people of Skye were never offered this facility as an alternative
to the bridge and if they had been, as they should have been, there
would have been no demand for this bridge with its ''Skye-high'' tolls.
(3) The present ferry makes a substantial profit per year (the
Scottish Office won't publish the figure but #1m is not denied) which is
used to help subsidise the other non-profit-making MacBrayne ferry
routes.
You quote a Scottish Office Minister as saying they ''do not want to
spend taxpayers' money on a ferry service situated directly alongside
the new bridge'' (July 15). But the ferry makes a profit, and what is
more, the CalMac board has stated that it would be very happy to run a
ferry in competition with the bridge, but of course the Scottish Office
will not allow this.
The real reason is, of course, as was stated by a Tory HRC councillor
on the radio programme Speaking Out six weeks ago, that no private
capital, ie from the Bank of America, would be put into a toll bridge
unless the Scottish Office had guaranteed to remove the profit-making
ferry.
The Scottish Office will now have to find the shortfall in CalMac's
profit from the taxpayer to make up the losses on the company's other
routes. In effect the Government is giving the bridge company a large
subsidy.
I wonder if it is mere coincidence that one of the partners in the
bridge company, Miller Construction, has its HQ in Lord James's
constituency, and has in the past given handsomely to Tory Party funds.
(4) In spite of what the Scottish Office says about discussing the
toll regime the demand from Skye and Lochalsh District Council, the HRC,
and everybody on Skye was for no tolls on this bridge. Even the Scottish
Office's appointed Reporter at the public inquiry, incidentally held
after the Government had signed the bridge order contract, condemned the
proposed high-toll regime and said that it should be subsidised, but
they would not even listen to her.
(5) The bridge company claims that the bridge charges will be the same
as the ferry's would be, and it quotes some figures. However it does not
say that a very significant group of vehicles, ie light commercial vans,
trucks, minibuses, etc, which currently pay the car fare of #5.40 on the
ferry one-way, will now pay #9.80 one-way on the bridge.
It also says there will be concessions for regular users but this will
not be per journey, but only for purchasing books of 10 journeys. In
other words, a free loan to the bridge company.
What about the regular user who goes to the mainland once a month or
once every two months? He will have to pay between #30 and #40 for a
10-journey book in order to get his discount, or else pay the full
price. And in the case of the vans, light commercial vehicles, and
minibuses, very frequent users, I understand they will only get a 10%
discount on their 10-journey book of tickets.
(6) The Scottish Office tells us the tolls are linked to inflation.
Why should they be? I know of no other case of any toll bridge in
Scotland or the UK, or indeed ferry services, that are automatically
linked to inflation.
The Scottish Office also does not publicise the fact that after the
first three years of operation the bridge company can increase the toll
charges by as much as 30% in any one year if it is not getting the
income it needs.
The bridge is now a fact of life but a continuing effort of opposition
to the toll charges must be carried on. To this end I hope a ferry in
opposition does get under way as I most certainly will be supporting it.
We should not be fooled by anything the bridge company says about the
more people travelling over the bridge, the sooner it will be free. Is
there a toll bridge in the UK or anywhere in the world that has had the
toll removed after its cost had been recovered?
Finally, let it be quite clear that it will not be the tourists who
will pay for this bridge, as they come to Skye only occasionally. It is
us, the people of Skye, who are paying for this bridge every day of our
lives, added on to the cost of everything we buy.
From a Government who gave us the poll tax we now have the privilege
of a ''bridge tax''. If this Tory Government receives one vote from the
Isle of Skye at the next election it will certainly be one more vote
than it deserves.

<TEXT>
First, 370 yards, par 4 (Burn): The widest fairway in golf, more than
100 yards, is shared with the eighteenth. In front of the green is the
Swilcan Burn, only a few feet wide, but enough to make club selection
vitally important. It might only be a sand wedge for the big-hitters,
but they should remember that Ian Baker-Finch spun back into the water
when leading in 1984. 1990: 1 eagle, 134 birdies, 276 pars, 38 bogeys, 7
double bogeys or worse. Average score 3.82. Rank (1 hardest, 18 easiest)
15.
Second, 411 yards, par 4 (Dyke): With gorse down the right the
temptation is to aim left, but that brings Cheape's bunker into play
and, even if it is avoided, the approach to the first of the seven
undulating double greens is tougher from that side. Three-putting was
largely responsible for making it the fourth toughest hole last time.
1990: 66 birdies, 290 pars, 89 bogeys, 11 worse. Average 4.1. Rank 4.
Third, 371 yards, par 4 (Cartgate Out): Again the best angle to the
green is from the right, although bushes and a row of bunkers lie in
wait for any pushed drive. Those choosing the other route must fly the
Principal's Nose cluster -- a bigger problem on the sixteenth -- and
then come in over the deep Cartgate trap. 1990: 1 eagle, 108 birdies,
323 pars, 23 bogeys, 1 worse, Average 3.81. Rank 16.
Fourth, 463 yards, par 4 (Ginger Beer): The shortest line is through
an alley right of a bank of rough and the reward is a clearer sight of
the green. Left is safer, leaving a second shot over Cottage bunker and
a large mound. What might look a good shot can be thrown off into some
horrid spots if the mound is not carried. 1990: 34 birdies, 305 pars,
112 bogeys, 5 worse. Average 4.19. Rank 3.
Fifth, 564 yards, par 5 (Hole O'Cross Out): The first of only two par
5s is a real birdie chance providing the seven small bunkers lurking
down the right are missed. Firing the next shot over or between the
Spectacles brings the biggest green in golf -- roughly an acre --- into
range. The average score was less than the par 4 seventeenth last time.
1990: 13 eagles, 189 birdies, 220 pars, 32 bogeys, 2 worse. Average
4.61. Rank 18.
Sixth, 416 yards, par 4 (Heathery Out): A blind drive over heather and
gorse bushes. Picking the line is crucial because of the bunkers on
either side of the fairway. Those to the left rejoice in the name ''The
Coffins.'' A ridge at the front of the green makes the second shot more
difficult that it appears at first. 1990: 68 birdies, 316 pars, 66
bogeys, 6 worse. Average 4.03. Rank 7.
Seventh, 372 yards, par 4 (High Out): The start of the six-hole Loop.
A brave drive close to the bushes on the right leaves only a short pitch
over the huge Cockle bunker, crossing the par 3 eleventh on the way.
Curtis Strange had the first of six successive birdies here on his way
to the course record 62 in the 1987 Dunhill Cup. 1990: 92 birdies, 292
pars, 69 bogeys, 3 worse. Average 3.96. Rank 11.
Eighth, 178 yards, par 3 (Short): By far the easier of the two par 3s,
although the green is not as flat as it first appears and the degree of
difficulty is greatly increased if the flag is tucked behind the Short
bunker, which has a deep, vertical face. 1990: 49 birdies, 364 pars, 42
bogeys, 1 worse. Average 2.99. Rank 9.
Ninth, 356 yards, par 4 (End): A birdie opportunity for all and in the
right conditions the big-hitters can reach the green. Bushes and rough
land line the left side, but two bunkers 70 and 50 yards short of the
green are the biggest danger on a fairway shared with the tenth. 1990: 1
eagle, 102 birdies, 319 pars, 32 bogeys, 2 worse. Average 3.85. Rank 14.
Tenth, 342 yards, par 4 (Bobby Jones): The hole was named in honour of
the 1927 winner in 1972, the year after his death. Again, there is
trouble down the left, but acres of room out to the right and, given a
favourable wind, the chance to hammer a drive down near or on the green
is one that most will choose to take on. 1990: 1 eagle, 138 birdies, 281
pars, 36 bogeys. Average 3.77. Rank 17.
Eleventh, 172 yards, par 3 (High In): The cavernous Hill and Strath
bunkers eat into the most difficult green on the course. Relief at
staying out of them can change to despair if the ball bounces over the
back towards the Eden estuary or kicks right and rolls down towards the
seventh flag. 1990: 1 hole-in-one, 54 birdies, 332 pars, 64 bogeys, 5
worse. Average 3.04. Rank 5.
Twelfth, 316 yards, par 4 (Heathery In): The third driveable par 4 in
the space of four holes finishes off the Loop. Hidden pot bunkers dot
the fairway, while the green is split in two by a deep step. The shorter
the second shot, the easier it is to set up the birdie chance which the
hole offers. 1990: 2 eagles, 83 birdies, 308 pars, 60 bogeys, 3 worse.
Average 3.95. Rank 12.
Thirteenth, 425 yards, par 4 (Hole O'Cross In): Decision time. The
line from tee to green goes through The Coffins, so they must either be
carried or steered away from. Going right means careful control of the
drive because a steep bank juts in, while choosing the sixth fairway can
leave a blind second to a green which invites some devilish pin
placings. 1990: 23 birdies, 288 pars, 131 bogeys, 14 worse. Average 4.3.
Rank 2.
Fourteenth, 567 yards, par 5 (Long): Out of bounds down the right and
the Beardies to be avoided, but that is just for starters. Once into the
Elysian Fields fairway the battle with Hell bunker lies ahead. And
beyond this huge expanse of sand lie the tiny, but appropriately deadly
Grave bunkers. Many opt to go down the fifth fairway. 1990: 2 eagles,
109 birdies, 264 pars, 67 bogeys, 14 worse. Average 4.97. Rank 10.
Fifteenth, 413 yards, par 4 (Cartgate In): The town comes into clearer
view and the church steeple is the accepted line. The lone Sutherland
fairway bunker was filled in in 1885, but one night locals went out with
spades and restored it. Another trap bites into the front of the green,
making it wise to hit one club more than it looks. 1990: 59 birdies, 342
pars, 53 bogeys, 2 worse. Average 4.0. Rank 8.
Sixteenth, 382 yards, par 4 (Corner of the Dyke): The Principal's Nose
triumvirate again force a decision of the players and they must not
forget that 30 yards further on lies Deacon Sime -- small, but acting
like a magnet. Go left or right and the Wig bunker front left of the
green and the out-of-bounds right have still to be negotiated. 1990: 69
birdies, 304 pars, 77 bogeys, 6 worse. Average 4.05. Rank 6.
Seventeenth, 461 yards, par 4 (Road): What drama this has seen. Drive
across the disused railway sheds and close to the hotel -- out of
bounds, of course -- and then ponder your second to a narrow green with
the notorious Road bunker in front and road and wall behind. The
toughest par 4 in championship golf and one which has decided a number
of Opens. A par feels like a birdie and a birdie feels like an
albatross. 1990: 15 birdies, 197 pars, 194 bogeys, 50 worse. Average
4.65. Rank 1.
Eighteenth, 354 yards, par 4 (Tom Morris): The most famous sight in
golf. The Swilcan Bridge, the Royal and Ancient Clubhouse, the line of
buildings down the right, Granny Clark's Wynd crossing the fairway and
the Valley of Sin short left of the sloping green. The one eagle in 1990
belonged to eventual winner Nick Faldo, who holed a pitch and run
through the valley to complete his first round in 67. 1990: 1 eagle, 98
birdies, 322 pars, 35 bogeys. Average 3.86. Rank 13.

EVEN professional golfers seasoned by years of campaigning to be
sceptical of reputations and opinions not formed by themselves, are
beguiled by the unique appeal of St Andrews.
For example, the Australian, Craig Parry, drove over from Gleneagles
Hotel, where he was playing in the 1989 Scottish Open Championship, for
his first sight of the Old Course -- which he and his wife absorbed in
awe, along with the fish supper they ate sitting on the steps below the
Royal and Ancient clubhouse.
A year later, Parry was challenging for the Open Championship in the
final round until four putts at the tenth and a damaging conflict with
the Beardies bunkers at the fourteenth finally demolished his hopes of
victory.
Europe's No.1 golfer, Colin Montgomerie, gave expression to the regard
and affection which most hold for the ancient links: ''There's nothing
daunting about them as an examination. It's just that the aura of the
place puts you in the position of saying to yourself: 'I'm here and I'm
doing this,' and then the pressure comes.''
It was surely only the innocence of 19-year-old youth which prompted
the United States amateur champion, Tiger Woods, to reply last week,
when asked what advice he had been given for tackling the Old Course:
''The greens are big, hit everything left.'' There can be no argument
about the first statement; those with experience of this Artful Dodger
of a test will certainly dispute the second.
There are few if any, contemporary professionals who would adopt the
tunnel-visioned attitude of Ben Hogan. Having won the 1953 Open at
Carnoustie at his one and only attempt (and he did not defend), he
responded to a questioner if he had taken the opportunity to play at St
Andrews: ''No, I didn't have time. I was there for one purpose.''
The entry for the 124th Championship and the twenty-fifth at the
acknowledged headquarters of the game since 1873, has, at 1836 never
been more numerous, and the strength of the exempt field, which has now
been supplemented from the regional and final qualifying competitions to
159, has never been greater. The holder, Nick Price, will not easily
join Tom Watson, in 1983 the last to defend successfully.
For instance, 12 former champions are competing -- Ian Baker-Finch,
Severiano Ballesteros, Mark Calcavecchia, Bob Charles -- the only
left-handed winner -- Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Jack Nicklaus, Greg
Norman, Gary Player, Lee Trevino, Watson, and Tom Weiskopf.
Calcavecchia, in 1989, was the last American winner of the Open while
Nicklaus (1970 and 1978), Ballesteros (1984), and Faldo (1990) are the
most recent winners at St Andrews.
But the richness of the challenge for the title of Champion Golfer of
the Year and the prize of #125,000, which is the winner's portion of the
total of #1.25m does not end there. As always, the younger generations
of professionals will be pressing their suits with an ardour their
elders, if not now their betters, will find hard to resist.
As usual these days, it is almost impossible to look down the list of
exempt players and also take into account the best of those who have
emerged relatively unscathed from the qualifying terms of trial to think
of any player of world class, or who has pretentions in that direction
who is not competing.
The likelihood of some equivalent of a 'village Hampden' languishing
in humble obscurity yet is worthy of consideration as a potential winner
of the third of the season's four major championships is so remote a
possibility as to be invisible to the most fevered imagination.
But, thankfully, amid all the hum and stir of a great sporting
occasion and the pomp and circumstance with which victory is invested
room remains for sentiment. Thus Arnold Palmer approaching his
sixty-sixth birthday, will make his twenty-third and final appearance in
the Championship over the course where, in the 1960 Centenary Open, he
made his first.
Kel Nagle, of Australia, beat Palmer, frequently misled by the
subtleties of the Old Course's greens, by one stroke so that Palmer,
already the winner that year of the Masters and US Open titles, was
denied equalling Hogan's achievement of seven years before, unequalled
since of winning the year's first three majors.
But the fire which Palmer had begun to fan under the game in the
United States and elevated from a degree of blandness to rare heights of
excitement was duly lit on these shores.
Gene Sarazen said in another age that every time a professional
stretched a winner's cheque between his fingers he should offer up a
silent prayer of thanks to Walter Hagen for the affect his dashing golf
and outgoing personality had on the game in the twenties and thirties.
Three decades later, Palmer could be accorded the same degree of
gratitude -- his arrival happily coinciding with the spread of
television and the introduction of the jet engine.
There has been speculation that this might also be Nicklaus' last
entrance on to the stage he twice adorned with such distinction. It is
not in any way to discredit.
Doug Sanders' gallant attempt to win the title in 1970 to recall that
when he looked like doing so, a colleague now long gone, rushing up the
last fairway, his eyes almost starting from their sockets, declared with
a strangled gasp : ''If Sanders wins, he'll set golf back 50 years.''
Of course, as all the world knows, Nicklaus duly won the play-off,
confirming golf's second Great Triumvirate of Palmer, Nicklaus, and
Player.
There will always be lingering regret that Palmer was denied the
satisfaction both of joining the two others, and Sarazen and Hogan, as
the only professionals to complete the quadrilateral of major
championship and winning the Open at the place sanctified as the Alma
Mater of golf from the date of May 14, 1754, when 22 noblemen and
gentlemen of Fife formed themselves into The Society of St Andrews
Golfers, later to become under the patronage of King William IV, The
Royal and Ancient Golf Club. But even before the establishment in the
early fifteenth century of Scotland's oldest university, the game was
quite literally in full swing.
Thus it was that Bernard Darwin, the doyen of British golf writers,
was able to comment: ''It is delightful to see a whole town given up to
golf. To see the butcher and the baker and the candlestick maker
shouldering his clubs as soon as the day's work is done and making a
dash for the links.''
It is doubtful whether, despite all the upheavals of this century that
that practice has changed much -- except that the shoulder may now be an
inadequate support for the weight of equipment without which players
nowadays feel they cannot possibly do their game justice. But one
element is unchanging, as it will always be.
St Andrews has been described as not so much a place for golf, more a
state of mind -- to golfers what Florence is to artists and Paris to
lovers.
Some say God made the Old Course before he addressed himself to the
more pressing demands of the creation.
Others declare that, instead of resting on the seventh day, he devised
the links simply as a means of keeping his hand in.
Some, lacking imagination and feel for the course, comparing
unfavourably its crafty eccentricities against the more sanitised
layouts of today, could with profit reflect on the view ''that there is
no place in Scotland over which the genius of antiquity lingers so
impressively.''
Indeed, and as an evening sun casts long shadows over the Old Course
and makes the Valley of Sin in front of the home green look as wide and
deep as a swimming pool, members of the public still, at their leisure,
can stroll across the hallowed turf.
For, like Carnoustie, these championship links belong to no one
private club.
In fact, the legacy of their creation and preservation is that, in
very real terms, they belong to the world.

THE current boom in farm land prices could be short-lived if expected
changes in the Common Agricultural Policy support system emerge within
the next few years, farmers were warned yesterday.
''We do not know if the UK Government will look after farming
interests in the same way as does France and Germany,'' said Sandy
Inverarity, chairman of the Scottish Agricultural Securities
Corporation.
He said the long-term future of the farming industry in Scotland would
depend on CAP benefits being applied evenly, yet recent events had seen
France and Germany providing separate national support.
SASC general manager Ken Ballantyne said: ''The land market is showing
signs of heating up to the extent of 1976 when there was a potato boom.
With a buoyant potato trade in 1994-95 I have a feeling of ''deja vu''.
He added: ''I expect land prices to continue to increase by 10% to 15%
per annum for the next two years. Thereafter we enter a period of
uncertainty.'' He pointed out that farm profits currently come from the
CAP and green pound revaluations.
''How much longer will the European public pay for the CAP? I suggest
that so long as the French and Germans dominate the EC, it is likely
that any efforts that are made by the UK Government to reduce support
for agriculture will be successfully defeated.''
The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation, which is owned by
Scottish banks and competes with the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
for business, was announcing a new flexible loan scheme which gives
borrowers the chance to use variable and fixed rates for their benefit.
However, Mr Ballantyne warned: ''Prospective buyers of farms and land
agents should not be carried away by the current heated land market.
''Farming is a long-term commitment; the immediate future looks bright
but uncertainty could well be over the horizon.''
At present good arable land is worth around #2500 per acre.

<FLAG>BARINGS REPORT</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>977322179</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, yesterday
criticised the Bank of England, the managers of the collapsed Barings
Bank, its trader Nick Leeson, and Barings' auditors in Singapore.
In a statement to the Commons on the report by the Board of Banking
Supervision into the bank's failure, he agreed with its finding that
there was no need for fundamental changes in Britain's financial
regulation but there was ''a need for improvement in the implementation
of the existing arrangements''.
He rejected a call from Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown to set up a
review into whether the Bank of England should continue in its
regulatory role after what Mr Brown called the report's ''damning
indictment'' of the way it had failed to supervise Barings.
Mr Clarke told the House he had considered very carefully the legal
considerations of the board's report but ''the balance of the public
interest'' lay firmly in favour of publishing it in full.
The report's main findings were that:
* The losses had been incurred by unauthorised and concealed trading
activities within Barings Futures Singapore.
* The true position had not been noticed earlier because of serious
failures of controls and managerial confusion within the Barings group.
* The true position had not been detected prior to the collapse by the
external auditors, supervisors or regulators of Barings.
In exchanges with Mr Brown, the Chancellor declared there had been
''failings'' in the Bank of England.
Mr Clarke said the board had identified a number of shortcomings in
implementation by the Bank.
''It considers that an error of judgment was made in 1993 in giving
Barings Brothers and Co an 'informal concession' in relation to the
normal obligation of a bank to notify in advance exposures representing
over 25% of its capital base.
''The time taken by the Bank of England to address the policy issues
involved resulted in what the board judged to be an unacceptable delay
of almost two years in reimposing the 25% limit.''
Mr Clarke also told the House that the inquiry board had not been able
to gain access to all the information it would have liked.
''In particular, they were unable to determine Nick Leeson's motives,
or whether he was acting alone, because of serious difficulties in
obtaining information from Singapore.
''The obstacles were, I understand, legal ones.''
Mr Clarke added: ''Leeson himself was invited to co-operate with the
inquiry but declined to do so. Through his solicitors, he has been
informed of the conclusions the board have reached about his part in the
collapse.''
His solicitors had written to the board saying the report's
conclusions were ''inaccurate in various respects but they did not
provide any further details of his response'', said the Chancellor.
The report described how the cumulative loss had been ''a staggering
#827m''.
Mr Clarke added: ''Leeson successfully sought to conceal those huge
losses throughout by a complex and systematic process of deception and
false reporting.''
No-one within Barings had accepted responsibility for Leeson's
activities for the whole of 1994, he told the House.
To Opposition jeers, he told the House: ''The board do not consider
that the events leading up to the collapse point to the need for any
fundamental change to the framework of regulation in the UK.
''But there is, they conclude, a need for improvements in the
implementation of the existing arrangements.''
For Labour, Mr Brown said there had been ''an astonishing admission''
from the Bank of England in the report ''that there were no guidelines
or systems in place to deal with the problem''.
The report disclosed ''not just the blame that must attach to Mr
Leeson, who gambled away a bank and who awaits trial in Singapore'', but
also that ''the system of regulation designed to detect and check
irregularities is now also on trial''.
He pressed Mr Clarke: ''Will action be taken against the management of
Barings under the Banking Act?
''Do we have an assurance they will not be allowed to take senior
management positions in other banks except under the most stringent
controls?''
Mr Brown also pressed the Chancellor: ''Why has no requirement yet
been imposed on other banks to ensure the existence of adequate and
greater controls to detect excessive exposure on a daily basis?''
On the Bank of England, Mr Brown said: ''Is it not clear that the
report has provided a damning indictment of the Bank of England's whole
approach to the supervision of the banking system?''
The Chancellor replied: ''There are failings inside the Bank, which is
why 17 recommendations are addressed to the Bank and why the Bank have
accepted those recommendations and are addressing them.''

<HEADLINE>Flagging revenues restrict scope for tax cuts. June PSBR soars to #3279m</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KENNETH Clarke's scope for cutting taxes in the November Budget is
being constricted by a run of poor Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
figures in which tax revenues are lagging behind Treasury projections.
The most probable explanation for this is that the economy, and in
particular consumer spending, is slowing down in response to
interest-rate and tax hikes. If so this would actually strengthen the
economic case for tax cuts, though undoubtedly the fiscal flexibility
would be seriously curtailed.
The PSBR last month has emerged at #3279m. This was not only well
above City expectations of around #2500m, but it was also in excess of
the #2839m shortfall in June of last year.
Top economists in the City were pretty snooty about the prospects for
tax cuts after the figures were published by the Central Statistical
Office. Goldman Sachs' David Walton doubted if they could be justified
and James Capel's Adam Cole forecast that they would be confined to
about #2000m, the equivalent to 1p off the basic rate of income tax.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer is hardly likely to be deterred by the
slower-than-anticipated improvement in the public finances. From the
Government's point of view tax cuts are a political imperative, and both
he and the Prime Minister promised that they would be forthcoming in
November during the recent battle for the leadership of the Conservative
Party.
There are some special factors at work in the latest borrowing
figures, but even after taking account of these the Treasury's revised
forecast (at the end of last month) of a #23.6bn PSBR for 1995-96 is
looking optimistic before the ink is dry on the paper.
The Treasury blamed unusual borrowing and repayment patterns by local
authorities and public corporations. Local authorities borrowed #186m
against repayments of #171m in June of last year. Public corporations
repaid just #171m, much less than the #579m in the same month last year.
Goldman Sachs drew attention to the erratically high level of interest
payments, epitomised in the June figure of #1613m against #861m in June
of last year. This is expected to unwind in the months ahead as should
the timing problems with the local authority and public corporation
elements in the figures.
In the first three months of the fiscal year the PSBR, excluding
privatisation proceeds, improved by just #600m. Were this pattern to be
maintained the PSBR would be higher this year than last since
privatisation proceeds are planned to be #3400m less. The Treasury is
forecasting an improvement of #11.2bn.
The big problem lies on the revenue side of the public accounts. So
far total cash receipts are 8.9% higher than in the first three months
of last year. This compares with the Treasury's summer forecast of a
rise of 10.9% over the year as a whole.
Inland Revenue receipts are 13% higher in the first three months, but
Customs and Excise are only 6.5% better. Social Security contributions
have grown by 5%. The notable weakness in Customs and Excise yields
reflects the lacklustre state of consumers' expenditure, though this may
well begin to recover later in the year.
It is of course much too early to project the outcome of the PSBR from
just three months' figures. Corporation tax receipts, currently in line
with Treasury forecasts, are an imponderable since the three biggest
collection months -- July, October and January -- are yet to come. James
Capel reckons there is room for pleasant surprises in this area, which
is by far the most cyclical element of the PSBR.
Spending is proceeding more or less according to plan, with net
departmental outlays 3.5% ahead in the first three months compared with
the Treasury's forecast of 3.7%.
But doubts are emerging about the Government's ability to stick to its
spending plans in the forthcoming round, especially given their reliance
on freezing public sector pay. Initial departmental bids are said to be
about #17bn above budget, a much worse starting point than in recent
years.
A tough round of bargaining by the new-look Cabinet is in prospect if
Clarke is to preserve his diminishing scope for giving his party's
election prospects a boost by cutting taxes.
His room for manoeuvre depends on the PSBR for 1996-97, which the
Treasury is projecting at #16.1bn, the equivalent of 2% of gross
domestic product, but this figure would be subject to upward revision in
the likely event of a significant overshoot in the current fiscal year
or any slippage in public spending restraint.
Statistical diet
A HEFTY diet of economic statistics is due in the remainder of the
week, starting with June retail sales and unemployment figures tomorrow
and ending with the CSO's first stab at second-quarter GDP on Friday.
Adam Cole is forecasting a further recovery in retail sales with a
rise of 0.4% last month following the 0.2% advance in May. This is a
notoriously volatile series making monthly guesstimates unreliable. But
it is clear that an unexpected drop would be a major setback to
prospects of a slowdown in activity to a more sustainable pace.
Unemployment is thought likely to fall further, though at a more
moderate pace than last year.
A greater imponderable is the growth in GDP in the second quarter.
Private estimates are clustered around 0.5%. There are few clues to the
performance of the preponderant service sector, though it is known that
industrial production was flat.
If the figures show that the growth rate has slowed down to below its
trend rate of 2.25% per annum it would greatly strengthen the
Chancellor's hand in rejecting calls from the Governor of the Bank of
England, Eddie George, for a rise in rates. Minutes published later
today are expected to show that these were repeated when the two men met
in June.

HEATHER is certainly Scotland's most beautiful wild plant and
glorified in book and song over many generations. In recent years many
thousands of pounds have been spent in efforts to preserve and encourage
greater growth of heather.
Overgrazing is often blamed as being the cause of damage to heather
but this is only true in relatively few cases. On the great majority of
hill farms there has been a constant ''bound'' stock of ewes, the
numbers have altered very little over generations -- in my own case
rather fewer ewes than 100 years ago.
The real menace is the spread of bracken and I have proved that if
heather is burned in a bracken area, then the bracken will take over
before the young heather matures. One other cause is the lack and cost
of labour, shepherds and gamekeepers, to burn heather as it should be
done.
Apart from the beauty of heather, the real value is summed up in The
Herald (June 7) : ''Fishing and shooting play vital role in rural
economy.'' How very true!
Heather is the home of grouse and many other birds, but how very
useless it is to promote heather where no birds can survive because of
the rapid increase in the number of various birds of prey which enjoy
protection by law.
We, as farmers or landowners welcome genuine country lovers on to our
land, but what do these good people want to see or to show to their
children?
Do they want to see a covey of grouse, some curlews and golden
plovers, perhaps a mallard swimming in a pool with six or seven little
ducklings paddling beside her (or maybe one on her back)?
Do they want to see larks soaring in the sky or a pair of
moss-cheepers nesting, possibly foster parents for a young cuckoo?
Perhaps even a pair of cuckoos themselves?
Alternatively do they want to hide behind a rock with powerful
field-glasses and watch a pair of hen harriers taking in small grouse
one by one from a covey to feed their young? Or do they want to watch a
peregrine swooping on to a flying grouse or knocking the head of
someone's homing pigeon?
Or even worse, do they want to watch a pair of ravens attacking a
lambing ewe and unable to help herself -- first they peck out her eyes
and then attack the half born lamb, the mother still alive?
Simpler still, without field-glasses, one can watch a buzzard
snatching a young pheasant from a brood beside its mother.
The real question is, do we country lovers want to see unlimited birds
of prey -- protected by law -- or do we want to see many other birds we
love so much? We cannot have both.

CANADIAN Pizza yesterday braced shareholders for bad news after it
warned that half-year profits will more than halve to #600,000.
Last year in the six months to the end of June the pizza producer
enjoyed pre-tax profits of #1.4m.
It lost a significant part of a major account in 1994 and the
combination of that and the difficult trading conditions in food
processing and fierce pricing pressure in the shops had added to its
problems, the company said.
On a brighter note, the Manchester-based firm said three new major
accounts had been won recently.
''The effects of these new accounts will begin to benefit the
profitability of the company during the second half of the year.''
The group stressed the UK market was unlikely to improve in the near
future, but exports were likely to continue to grow and would remain the
primary profit generator.

A MAN who slashed an 18-month-old baby girl across the forehead was
jailed for four years yesterday.
The High Court in Glasgow heard the baby, who cannot be named for
legal reasons, was asleep when David Spowage, 21, burst into the bedroom
looking for her father, whom he blamed for defacing his front door. He
lashed out with a knife and the child screamed as blood poured from a
head wound.
Spowage, of Kimberley Street, Craigneuk, Wishaw, admitted assaulting
the father and daughter in their Craigneuk home on March 25. Two other
accused, James Marshall, 16, of Flaxmill Avenue, Craigneuk, and Mr
William Fisher, 23, of Airbles Road, Motherwell, had not guilty pleas
accepted.
Mr Iain Ferguson, prosecuting, said the Crown conceded the injuries to
the girl were accidental and it had not been Spowage's intention to
assault her. She had to have two stitches in a 2cm wound.

IN response to John Macleod, Derek Young says: ''The modern teenager
is perfectly aware that marriage is not at all sensible when the two
parties have no idea if they're sexually compatible'' (July 13).
He and others like him would appear to agree that investigating this
compatibility before marriage is a good idea. Can they tell us why it is
that since this practice has become more common, there has been no
apparent increase in marital happiness or fidelity, and an alarming
increase in divorces?
Could it be that God, who loves his people and knows how they are
made, is right to advise them along the lines that John Macleod
reiterates; that love, trust and commitment should be in place before
intercourse; and that faithfulness should follow it?
That would be a novel idea today! But if it is correct, should the
opinions voiced above not be the next sexual taboo to be removed? Our
teenagers should be told.

<HEADLINE>Investment boost for Longannet mine. Coal losses grow to #18.3m</HEADLINE>

NATIONAL Power, Britain's biggest power generation company, has agreed
to buy more coal from Coal Investments on a new contract that runs into
the year 2000.
This contract brings to 2.8 million tonnes the total tonnage supplied
by Coal Investments to National Power over the next five years,
equivalent to about 10% of its total requirement.
Malcolm Edwards, chairman of Coal Investments, said that the National
Power contract means that his company could plan ahead with confidence,
increase its production, reduce the cost base further and create more
jobs for miners.
The announcement came as Coal Investments reported a
bigger-than-expected loss of #18.3m compared with a #2.1m loss
previously. This reflects the immediate write-down costs of re-opening
and developing pits.
Production capacity has grown by more than the company had expected at
this stage of its development, two-thirds of which is covered by secure
long-term contracts.
The company raised nearly #50m on the stock market to fund its
development in the 18 months to end March 1995. In the current year,
with more pits becoming productive, profits are expected to grow to
around #10m.
Coal Investments owns one-third of Mining (Scotland), the Scottish
mining assets of British Coal, which has the biggest reserves of
low-sulphur coal in the UK. These were acquired in December 1994 at a
price, both in terms of reserves and current sales, significantly lower
than the other successor companies to British Coal.
Mining (Scotland) made a lower-than-expected contribution to the
1994-95 results primarily due to short-term operational problems at the
Longannet deep mine. However, the board is confident that the full
potential of the Scottish mining operation can be realised.
Between #15m and #20m is to be invested in Longannet in the current
year, developing two new drifts on the existing site. This will secure
the mine's two-million tonnes per annum production capacity for the next
20 years. International design consultants are currently assessing the
site.
Coal Investments is confident that there will be a growing demand for
coal from Mining (Scotland). This is expected to come from the upgrading
of the interconnector to England, the possible development of an
interconnector to Northern Ireland and increasing demand from the
Peterhead power station as its sour gas supplies run down and these are
replaced by coal.
Originally, Coal Investments envisaged developing a total production
capacity of 1.8 million tonnes per annum with the target market being
industrial and home heating plus specialised coal producers. By next
year, the group's production capacity will have grown to 5.5 million
tonnes. This large coal production business will have been built within
2[1/2] years at one of the lowest costs in the world.
Coal Investments is making sure that it does not become too reliant on
any one customer and so has a broad spread of business. Around half of
its business is with the power generators, one-quarter in coking and the
remainder with industrial and domestic customers. Although domestic
demand for coal has been steadily declining over the years there is
still an annual requirement in the UK for around 2.25 million tonnes.
Coal Investments shares were a penny lighter at 107p. There is no
dividend.

I DON'T spend sleepless afternoons worrying about the prospects for
devolution south of the Border. As it happens I am broadly in favour, if
only because I can't conceive of anything worse for the outlying parts
of England than having their politics entirely dictated from the
Westminster Palace of Enchantments.
It is then with some disappointment that I understand that Jack Straw
is about to release a Labour consultation document effectively putting
the kybosh on any radical plans for regional assemblies.
It would be unwise to assume that there are no implications for
Scotland in this latest likely Labour climbdown. Those who have made the
mistake of making their constitutional plans for Scotland contingent on
developments in England seem set to look rather foolish.
Of course devolution for England is not without practical problems.
Any legislative proposal runs up against a near millennium of one system
of common law. On the other hand, if no legislative competence is
proposed then it opens the question of what English regional assemblies
could do that English local government couldn't do if given half the
chance.
The lack of clarity in Labour's thinking has been painfully apparent
every time debate on the issue has been joined. Some Labour MPs are
starting to fret that Gordon Brown is coming off worse in his recent
clashes with the Chancellor over the vacuum of Labour economic policy.
It is nothing like the hammering he took at the hands of the Today
programme in January on the subject of English devolution.
Gordon was being interviewed in advance of a speech he made on the
British constitution in response to the Prime Ministerial assault on
''teenage madness'' at the start of the year. It is worth recalling
exactly what he had to say on January 12 since it underlines the extent
of Labour's retreat in the intervening six months.
In that speech ''regional democracy'' in England was presented as the
key change from the 1970s which would make the Scottish and Welsh
proposals acceptable south of the Border. Specifically he argued that
''it is because a Scottish Parliament and an Assembly for Wales go hand
in hand with the offer of greater regional democracy throughout Britain
that what has been called the West Lothian question should not, in my
view, be a barrier to proceeding with change''.
By the same token then if, as is being suggested, Jack Straw tomorrow
places a ''triple lock'' on any English schemes the West Lothian
question presumably re-emerges as a major issue at least in the minds of
the Labour leadership.
The really worrying point for Scottish devolutionists is not so much
the fact that Labour is about to backtrack on its English plans but the
reasons why it is about to U-turn yet again.
In the weekend leaks ''sources close to the leadership'' were quoted
triumphantly as saying that they had ''shot the Tory fox''. In other
words, their policy position had completely crumbled under attack. The
argument seems to be if they advocate no change then there is less
chance of the Tories being nasty to them.
If that is the logic which dominates the thinking of those close to
the Labour leadership then how will their Scottish proposals stand up
when John Major attempts to rally Basildon Man against Labour selling
out to the Jocks?
There are a two ''chiels that winna' ding'' for Scottish
devolutionists. They are uncomfortable for some but worth restating.
First, the case for a Scottish Parliament should stand alone. Scotland
is not an area, district, region or sub-nation of Britain but a European
nation.
Thus the case for change is not just about an extension of democracy
or about reshaping the ramshackle British constitution, worthy
objectives though these may be. It is a national case which hinges on
the attractions of self-determination over any other political
condition.
Secondly, Labour's devotion to the Scottish cause has for the past two
decades been directly related to the electoral threat posed by the SNP.
Thus over the past six years Labour has been pushed on to ever more
radical ground in response to the fresh vigour of the SNP challenge to
Labour's Scottish grip.
If, however, a new political imperative were to emerge from south of
the Border then things could change again. If in consolidating Scotland
devolution were to be seen to put at risk the English political project
of (to use John Prescott's term) ''Tory'' Blair then key aspects of it
would be abandoned or watered down.
This would be done with the same degree of ruthlessness with which the
Labour leader has approached the other Tory ''foxes'' that he has shot.
Devolution is about as safe in Blair's grip as the health service is in
Tory hands. To put it mildly, Tony requires to have his mind
concentrated on these matters.
All of which leads to two clear conclusions.
First, Straw's coming climbdown on English Assemblies should be of
more than passing interest north of the Border.
Secondly, if people in Scotland want independence then they should
vote for it. What is sometimes less obvious but most certainly true is
that SNP votes are the only real guarantor of any significant
constitutional change.

RAIL privatisation could mean higher fares and higher council taxes in
the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive area, Shadow Transport
Minister Henry McLeish warned yesterday.
He also said the Government was increasing spending on Britain's PTEs
by #250m a year simply to ''fatten up Railtrack'' for privatisation. The
biggest rise was in Strathclyde, up 240% to #112m, but the increases
would not benefit services anywhere.
Mr McLeish was speaking in advance of yesterday's parliamentary debate
on Government funding of the PTEs, which provide rail services in
Strathclyde and six areas south of the Border.
He said the Government was having to boost spending just to pay the
extra costs of Railtrack's track access charges and the costs of leasing
trains from the rolling stock companies (Roscos). After Railtrack and
the Roscos were sold off, a move planned for 1996, this money would not
return to the Treasury, he said.
''Every year, #250m is being spent without improving a single rail
service, opening a new station or improving track signalling or safety.
Every penny of that cash is being used to fatten up Railtrack and the
leasing companies for privatisation. Once again, Tory dogma and Tory
Ministers are wasting taxpayers' money.''
Moreover, he said, the PTEs faced an uncertain future because, from
next year, the extra metropolitan rail grant paid to cover the
privatisation costs would be included in the main Government grant to
councils, the revenue support grant (RSG), but there would be no
guarantee that the RSG would be increased if Railtrack or the Roscos
increased charges.
In the Glasgow area, and those areas served by the other PTEs, there
were many commuters who relied on PTE services to get to work and secure
their livelihood.
''Now all of that is to be put at risk. The inherent uncertainty in a
privatised system, where private companies could hike charges overnight,
could lead to higher council taxes, huge fare increases, cuts in service
frequency, or even the end of some services completely.''
Yesterday's parliamentary debate dealt with metropolitan rail grant
orders for the English PTEs. The order for Strathclyde has already been
dealt with.
Meanwhile, Scottish Transport Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton has
stated that boundaries for the new Strathclyde Passenger Transport Area
present ''absolutely no threat whatsoever'' to concessionary travel
arrangements.
Last week's announcement of the boundaries prompted fears from some
MPs and councillors that thousands of people would miss out on
concessionary fares.
The size of the area is legally restricted to the boundaries of
Greater Glasgow but Strathclyde region has in practice, with the
approval of the Scottish Office, extended it to cover the whole region.
The new boundaries announced last week increase substantially the
official area but do not cover all of Strathclyde.
Lord James said yesterday that the Transport Act 1985 empowered any
local authority to provide concessionary travel for certain eligible
categories of person. The new unitary local authorities taking over in
April next year would retain those powers, including the power to
provide a joint concessionary travel scheme.
''The Government has recognised that the new Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Authority should have powers to make concessionary travel
schemes covering its area, just as the constituent authorities will
have, and the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994 now provides for
this.
''As I have explained, the new authorities will be able to co-operate
with each other in providing travel concession schemes, and they will
therefore be fully empowered to replicate the present arrangements
should they choose to do so.
''The Passenger Transport Authority/Passenger Transport Executive
structure is designed to facilitate public transport in urban areas of
high population density. It is not appropriate for rural areas. However,
the area I announced last week is substantially larger than the present
area. It ensures that the existing Strathclyde Zone Card travel area and
the whole of the present Strathclyde supported rail network is
included.''

RAIL services were almost completely wiped out in Scotland yesterday
as Aslef, the train drivers' union, staged the second in a series of
one-day strikes over pay, writes DUNCAN BLACK.
The only service ScotRail was able to run was a modified timetable on
the Glasgow-Ayr route, using drivers from the Rail, Maritime, and
Transport Union, whose members rejected strike action in their ballot.
There were no services on InterCity East Coast or InterCity West Coast.
Despite the rail stoppage, the Automobile Association reported no
problems with road traffic levels in Scotland.
Aslef's Scottish district secretary, Mr Pat O'Connor, said the
response from his members had been 100%, as it had been in the first
strike last week.
He said: ''Their morale has not been affected in any way by the
working of the trains to Ayr. It is a propaganda stunt by management and
it is a service they will not even be able to maintain on future strike
days because of the shift patterns of the RMT drivers.
''Those drivers support us but they have to stay within the law to
protect their jobs. Therefore, they have no alternative but to work
those services.''
Mr O'Connor added that Aslef members picketing Glasgow Central station
had met a ''fantastic'' level of public support. ''People understand
what the whole dispute is about and they are supporting us,'' he said.
RMT's Scottish divisional organiser, Mr Phil McGarry, said about 10
drivers were involved in working the Glasgow-Ayr service. ''The
management gave them notification that all traditional normal working
arrangements were cancelled today and issued emergency workings. They
have altered booking off and on times and there are no guarantees about
when they finish the working day.
''It is a terrible position our members find themselves in. They do
feel they are being used as pawns in this game.
''ScotRail is using RMT members to try to undermine the Aslef dispute.
I view the management's actions as tantamount to secondary action. If a
union did that, it would end up in court.''
However, a ScotRail spokesman said: ''The drivers are all rostered to
work on that route and we are quite happy that what we are doing is in
the right. We have an obligation to run a service where we can.''
The next two planned strikes, on July 27 and August 8, will coincide
with stoppages by the RMT on the London Underground.
Aslef will announce the result of its Tube workers' strike ballot
today. With a ''Yes to strikes'' vote expected, commuters could face
co-ordinated mainline-Tube strikes on August 25 and September 12 as
well.

Troubled train times but there may be hope on the horizon for a
Highland service.
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth will hold separate meetings in
London today with Transport Secretary Sir George Young and franchise
director Roger Salmon to reconsider the future of the Fort William
sleeper service.
ScotRail's director John Ellis, who had been due in Inverness today as
part of apromotional effort for the Far North Line, will also attend the
meetings.
The Herald understands that they represent the beginning of
negotiations to persuade Mr Salmon that his decision of December 14 to
axe the service because it was ''disproportionately uneconomic'' should
be re-examined and that a substantial economic case can be made.
The political impetus has been provided by the recent Cabinet
reshuffle and speculation continues to grow in the Highlands that a
source of subsidy may yet be found for Mr Salmon to include the Fort
William sleeper in passenger service needs for Scotland.
A spokesman for Highland Regional Council last night welcomed the news
of the meetings. ''We have a court order which insists that British Rail
continues to run the sleeper service until there is full public
consultation but we have always known that more was needed to save the
service in the long term.''
Meanwhile, rail regulator John Swift yesterday refused to give British
Rail permission to shut most of its light maintenance depot at Wembley,
north-west London, because of the continued uncertainty over the sleeper
services.
The depot, which is operated by InterCity West Coast, had serviced the
sleeper carriages when InterCity had responsibility for sleepers.
Permission had been sought for the closure because of Mr Salmon's
December announcement.
Since then, the Scottish sleepers have become the responsibility of
ScotRail, who moved the servicing of the Inverness/Euston service to
Inverness and the Fort William service to Polmadie, in Glasgow.
A spokesman for InterCity said last night: ''The regulator has said
the closure would be premature given the uncertainty.''

On the day the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill is expected to receive
the Royal Assent, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State at the
Scottish Office, explains how the legislation will produce safer
streets.
THE Government is determined that the people of Scotland should be
able to go about their lawful business without fear or anxiety. We must
ensure that our criminal law does not in any way inhibit the police in
their daily pursuit of preventing, investigating, and detecting criminal
activity.
That is our fundamental aim in the fight against the scourge of crime.
Law and order is, and continues to be, a number one priority.
If I were to pose the question ''what do you want for your children's
future?'', I would be surprised if a safer and more peaceful Scotland
was not almost everyone's response. We are determined that future
generations should be part of law-abiding societies, in which everyone
lives without the daily fear of becoming one of crime's statistics.
We have to make crime more difficult. And we have to ensure that the
consequences are tough on the criminal, kind on the victim.
Our eight police forces are in the front line of this battle.
But police officers diverted from the sharp end by unnecessary and
time-consuming court attendances cannot fulfil their crime-fighting
duties to the standards they, and the communities they serve, desire.
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which is expected to receive
Royal Assent today, will change all this.
Each year, the police service in Scotland spends millions of pounds
sending officers to give evidence at trials which do not take place; and
in many cases where police officers were required to give evidence, this
evidence was not contested, and there was no cross-examination. This,
and the other unnecessary burden of all witness citations having to be
hand-delivered by police officers led us to ask the question -- is this
really necessary?
The answer, plainly, is ''No''.
So the Bill makes changes which will reduce this wastage; the
introduction of mandatory first and immediate trial diets has the
potential to cut in half the number of police officers who attend court
as witnesses.
We know this is possible because it has already been piloted in four
busy courts throughout Scotland. The results have been astonishing.
At Edinburgh, 500 police witnesses are being stood down each month; at
Dunfermline it's 150 and at Dundee and Kirkcaldy, the figure is 100. To
have this system in place at all the courts in Scotland could lead to a
remarkable 70,000 police officer days in court being saved each year,
and freeing that amount of police time for duties where people want them
most -- out on the streets.
I consider it important that it is the proven criminal who suffers in
the aftermath of a crime. I know there is a widespread feeling that the
criminal justice system sometimes seems to lean on the side of the
perpetrator of crime rather than the victim. This Bill will go a long
way to changing that perception by tightening up on the granting of
bail, cracking down on those who stand to profit from their crime, and
reducing the number of potential jurors called to trials.
It is not just police officers who find themselves called to court
without reason. The present jury system means many members of the public
are cited but not actually required to take part. Changes to the rules
on objecting to jurors will result in a cut of wasted time too.
Bail Bandits is a term which has entered our vocabulary in recent
years. There are too many people thinking they can get away with
committing offences while released on bail. They will quickly learn that
they cannot. The Bill will give courts increased powers to extend the
maximum sentence on a bail offender by an extra six months' imprisonment
or a fine of up to #1000.
I know that victims of extremely violent or very personal crimes worry
that their alleged attackers will be released on bail. The Bill, again,
aims to ease their fears, by preventing bail where an accused is charged
with attempted murder, rape or attempted rape, and has a previous
conviction for such a serious crime.
Why should criminals be allowed to profit from their illegal
activities? You are right, they shouldn't, and we had no hesitation in
taking on board Scottish Law Commission proposals that courts should be
able to deprive criminals of the proceeds of serious crime, as they can
do at present in relation to drug trafficking. The money recovered will
first go to pay any compensation due to the victim under a Compensation
Order.
Readers of The Herald no doubt have concerns about aspects of the
criminal justice system in Scotland: this is understandable. This Bill,
with its fundamental aim to crack down hard on the criminal fraternity
while discouraging those who may be tempted to join their ranks, should
answer their fears.
Our commitment is not empty rhetoric. While the number of recorded
crimes in Scotland has fallen for the past three years, and the police
clear-up rate is at its highest for seven years, we must do everything
we can to maintain and, indeed, speed up the momentum. The Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Bill provides a starting point.

BARINGS bondholders still owed #100m in the wake of the bank's
collapse today vowed to fight in the courts for their money.
Bondholder spokesman Jonathan Stone said in reaction to the report:
''The main thrust of the campaign to recover #100m will be a legal
one.''
He said the Bank of England had adopted ''a dismissive attitude'' to
their quest to recover their money since Barings collapsed, adding:
''Governor Eddie George has put in a disgraceful performance.''
Mr Stone said bondholders had taken advice about grounds for legal
action against bodies including the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange,
and the managers of the failed Barings companies.
This process could take months. ''Until then, we cannot and would not
wish to point a finger at anyone.
''But we are encouraged, by the various dismissals and resignations
that have taken place, into believing that we will have grounds for
launching successful litigation,'' he said.
Bondholders are the only major losers remaining as depositors and
others had their money repaid after Barings was rescued by ING.
Mr Stone speaks for a group of hundreds of private investors,
including many pensioners, who took part in a capital-raising bearer
bond issue by Barings in 1994.
Bearer bonds, which pay a fixed rate of interest rather than a
dividend like company shares, can be bought and sold in the financial
markets.

<HEADLINE>Matthew Clark lifts earnings to #21.4m</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977322192</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DIVERSIFIED drinks group Matthew Clark is absorbing last October's
#105m acquisition of Gaymer cider faster and more efficiently than it
had expected which helped more than double pre-tax profits to #21.4m in
the year to April.
Now, chief executive Peter Aikens is on the prowl again for more
takeovers with wholesaling currently the prime target and particularly
those involved in beer distribution where Clark is relatively lightly
represented with its accounting for less than a third of divisional
turnover of #121m.
Overall group sales jumped 72% to #299m of which Gaymers contributed
some #63m. Cider volumes rose 9% which is a touch ahead of the overall
market advance of 8%, much in line with industry leader HP Bulmer but
well behind Taunton's 15%. Pricing is remaining aggressive for the Olde
English and K brands.
The profit figures are stated before exceptional charges of #32.7m
relating to the restructuring of Gaymer. That includes redundancies
totalling about 500 out of 850 employees and the closure of three
production plants, the last planned for August 1996.
Including the exceptional item, there was a swing from pre-tax profits
of #10.3m into a loss of #21.4m.
Forfar-based Strathmore has been UK market leader in sparkling water
since last November -- that was bought for #11m in 1992 -- and saw
volume sales rise 35% in the year. Mr Aikens said it now outsells
Perrier by two-to-one.
Encouragingly, earnings managed to improve 32% to leave the stock at
626p trading at 14.9 times historic earnings and about 12 times those
for this year on the basis of profits moving ahead to perhaps #36m.
The dividend total has been raised 17% to 21p with a 13p final for a
4.2% yield.

<FLAG>BARINGS REPORT</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>977322193</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of Barings has inevitably brought the role of the Bank of
England under severe scrutiny even if the Board of Banking Supervision,
set up to investigate the affair, puts almost all the onus on Barings
and on former derivatives trader Nick Leeson.
One unresolved question is why Mr Leeson did what he did as, according
to Bank of England Governor Eddie George, there is no evidence that he
benefited personally from the increasingly complex levels of dealing in
Singapore.
There are now calls for the Bank's regulatory role to be handed over
to another body with the possibility of a future Labour government
introducing a banking commission.
That does appear to be an attractive concept at first sight with
memories still rankling among depositors over the collapse of the Bank
of Credit and Commerce International.
However, Mr George argued vehemently against it last night.
While banking supervision is done differently elsewhere, a change in
Britain could only mean changing the brass plate on perhaps a different
building with, in all probability, the same people. And could one get
better people to act as regulators and supervisors?
There is also the cost question and the Head of Supervision, Brian
Quinn, argued that the Bank of England has proved more efficient in
preventing failures and at lower cost than has been the case in both
North America and Europe.
However, there was an almost tangible air of complacency from Mr
George when perhaps a little humility would have been in order. Only one
person has resigned, Mr Christopher Thompson, because he has, according
to Mr George, found his position untenable and felt that he had lost the
confidence of people around him. But who supervised Mr Thompson?
Mr George was quick to deny that there was an old boy atmosphere as
regards certain banks, although the board report does point to the Bank
regarding controls at Barings as ''informal but effective''.
Whether that would also apply to a second tier bank is debatable.
It is quite strange, looking at the report, to see how little direct
interest the Barings' board appeared to take in the running of the
Singapore operations apart from the levels of profitability. These were
at time so substantial that suspicions should have surely been aroused
and much closer independent supervision imposed.
Even as late as January, when something could have been done, managers
in London had become aware of market rumours and concerns about the
level of trading in Singapore and that there was a possibility that a
client could not meet a margin call. It even received on January 27, a
month before nemesis, a call from the Bank of International Settlements,
the body that supervises central banks such as the Bank of England, that
it had heard rumours about Barings.
These concerned the problems with the Nikkei contracts and that it
could not meet its margin calls. However, this apparently caused little
concern and nothing of substance was done.
The report said that Leeson, by the end of December last year, had run
up losses on account 88888 of some #208m.
''Throughout he represented that he was in fact making profits,'' it
added.
''Indeed, he was perceived within Barings to be a star performer.''
But by the end of February the accumulated losses on that account had
risen to #830m.
Leeson's unauthorised trading was concealed by a number of devices,
including the suppression of account 88888 from Barings in London,
submission of falsified reports to London, and the misrepresentation of
profitability as well as a number of false trading transactions and
accounting entries.
Barings collapsed the next month after losses totalling #827m were run
up by Mr Leeson. Barings was later taken over for the nominal sum of #1
by the Dutch financial services group ING.
However, given that the banking system is international and ever
seeking new avenues for profit, there will be episodes such as Barings.
Regulation and supervision should nip in the bud any potential
failures, but perhaps one should be realistic and accept that from time
to time a collapse will happen. So perhaps it will be necessary to
ensure that there is adequate compensation -- and retribution -- where
necessary.

ANGLO/Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier's decision to put up for
sale its newspaper publishing interests along with book and US magazine
operations, concentrates attention again on the shake-up that is going
on in newspapers outside just the London-based nationals, one of which
Express Group, part of United Newspapers, yesterday announced 220
redundancies in a major restructuring.
Reed's move follows the recent sale by Thomson of five of its English
and Welsh titles to regional newspaper group Trinity International and
the ''for sale'' notice put on its Scottish newspapers including the
Scotsman and the Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal although no serious buyer is
believed to have surfaced so far.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, recently announced that it was
cutting 520 staff at its regional newspaper operation Westminster Press
as part of a restructuring plan.
Reed, like Thomson, is anxious to concentrate on expanding its
information publishing and data business and reducing the relative
exposure to more volatile consumer markets. The proceeds of the
divestments are projected by analysts at more than #1000m and will be
used for both future acquisitions within the scientific, professional
and business segments of the portfolio and enhanced development plans
or, in the short term, for reducing borrowings.
The company has already added to its chosen area of expansion with the
purchase in December of electronic publisher Lexis-Nexis for #1100m but
this of course added substantially to group debt.
The Reed Regional Newspapers' operation, the biggest free-sheet
publisher in Britain, comprises four daily and 90 weekly newspapers,
most of them free. The dailies are the Worcester Evening News,
Colchester Evening Gazette, Bolton Evening News and the Lancashire
Evening Telegraph.
Also on the market are Dagbladunie, the publisher of two of the
Netherlands' leading national newspapers and a number of regional
titles. In its case a flotation is also being considered. Others for
sale include Reed Consumer Books, a leading trade, children's and
illustrated book publisher (whose titles include Winnie the Pooh),
comprising Hamlyn, Heineman and Secker &amp; Warburg, and Consumer
Magazines, comprising 14 Cahners Publishing titles serving the bridal,
childcare and boating sectors in the US and six titles published by
Bonaventura in the Netherlands.
Ian Irvine and Herman Bruggink, co-chairmen of Reed Elsevier, stressed
that each of the businesses has strong franchises and has produced
impressive results in recent years, which is a reflection of the
strength of the titles and their market position. They add: ''Despite
these characteristics, they no longer fit with Reed Elsevier's
increasingly focused international and product profile.''
In 1994 the combined businesses to be divested generated turnover of
#575m and an operating profit of #76m, accounting for 19% and 11% of
turnover and operating profit, respectively, of the group's combined
businesses.
After the sales, IPC Magazines, the UK's largest publisher of consumer
magazines, will be Reed Elsevier's only consumer publishing activity.
IPC has long been the market leader and is expected to remain in a
secure position within this large and growing consumer magazine market.
In addition to strategic reasons for holding on to IPC, the financial
justification is regarded as significant given IPC's substantial and
growing UK profits and cash flow.
So far as potential buyers are concerned, there was some speculation
that Thorn EMI, which took over Dillons bookshops when its parent
company collapsed, might be interested in the book division, while
publisher EMAP could be keen on the newspapers. However, monopoly
considerations might mean that newpapers would have to be broken up.
The activity in the regional press is regarded as inevitable
rationalisation by analysts who point to the cost of newsprint which has
soared this year and the impact of the newspaper price wars. On the
proposed sale of Reed Regional Newspapers as opposed to the Thomson
Scottish titles, one analyst noted that there were two very different
propositions on the table -- the choice between free titles at Reed
Elsivier and paid for titles at Thomson, not to mention the obvious
different characteristics of the papers. They are both, though, major
acquisitions.
Meanwhile, Express Newspapers, comprising the Daily and Sunday Express
and the more downmarket Daily Star, said that its 220 across-the-board
redundancies will result in a cost of #7.7m during the second half of
1995 but this will be recouped within one year by a reduction in
operating expenses.
The redundancies are spread across editorial, administration and
production. The cuts are being blamed on the 40% rise in the costs of
newsprint. However, the Daily Express in particular has also been badly
hit by the newspaper price wars -- which it did not participate in --
and its circulation has been suffering badly.
Rumours have also abounded that United Newspapers' chairman, Lord
Stevens, wanted to get out of the newspaper business but this has been
strongly denied. Commenting on the redundancies, which make up 15% of
the total staff, managing director Andrew Cameron said: ''That obviously
is very much part of the strategy we've been looking at to secure a good
future for the company. So it's looking very much ahead in terms of
technological change and staff structure.''
News of the proposed sale saw shares in Reed Intenational add 25p to
948p. This compares with a previous high this year of 927p and a low of
710p.

HE's not the kind of man you meet every day is Mr Charlie Pirie, head
gamekeeper of the 20,000 acres of the Glen Tilt part of the Duke of
Atholl's estate.
Now the whole of Britain is about to get to know Mr Pirie and his
forthright views on blood sports and everything else involved with his
life in a six-part ''fly on the hill'' BBC Scotland documentary series
due to go on the UK network on Friday next week.
As well as organising shooting parties from all over the world, he
himself shoots from the lip, not afraid to tackle the more controversial
areas of political correctness. ''The people in the towns have no idea
of the realities of life in the countryside,'' he said yesterday.
Of all the nationalities who come as shooting groups on these killing
fields, he rates the Italians the most dangerous: ''It's not true of all
of them, of course, but when the Italians arrive, they need a lot of
careful watching.''
Mr Pirie is now a gamekeeper in the limelight. Last night, he returned
to Glasgow for the first time since the early seventies. He was due to
do an interview for Reporting Scotland.
This morning, he flies to London for three magazine interviews and
three radio interviews. The last time he was in London was for the
Falklands Armistice parade. ''I have a lot of good friends in the SAS,''
he said.

THE safety and efficiency of Britain's air traffic control system is
under threat from the Government's insistence that a #200m centre at
Prestwick should be funded privately, it was claimed yesterday.
Political pressure is certain to increase following yesterday's
statement from Civil Aviation Authority chairman Sir Christopher
Chataway that private funding was ''inappropriate''.
The CAA is responsible for air traffic control over the UK (and large
chunks of the North Sea and Atlantic sectors) through National Air
Traffic Services (Nats), which it operates with the Ministry of Defence.
A new centre to replace the ageing buildings and equipment at
Prestwick is essential to the continuing development of services but the
Government has told the CAA that there is nothing in the kitty to pay
for it.
Instead it has been proposed that the centre should become part of the
Private Finance Initiative allowing a consortium to design, build,
equip, own, and maintain the centre and rent it back to Nats under a
20-year-lease.
In his most strongly worded public statement on the subject, Sir
Christopher said: ''This is not, in our view, a financing technique well
suited to individual projects within a totally integrated air traffic
control system which cannot function optimally if ownership and control
are fragmented in this way.''
He added: ''Moreover, rapid technological change makes it particularly
inappropriate to hand over control of major facilities for as long as 20
years.''
Sir Christopher said the PFI method was better than abandoning this
essential project but he added: ''We are insisting that Nats should have
an option to buy back control of these facilities if funding is later
available, whether from privatisation or by any other means.''
The CAA favours privatisation of Nats -- claiming it would release it
from the ''funding trap'' -- but following pressure from major airlines
and trade unions the Government has so far held off on this.
Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South and a member of the Commons
Transport Committee, said: ''This adds considerable weight to the
argument I have been putting forward for many months that air traffic
control is an essential function for the nation and should be financed
and supported from central funds.''
Mr Donohoe said he would be putting pressure both on the Government
and on his front-bench Labour colleagues to support the public funding
of the new Scottish centre.
Mr Doug Maclean, union spokesman for air traffic control workers,
said: ''We are in accord with the chairman that PFI is not the way
forward for the redevelopment of the Scottish centre.''

TWO down and one to go: after taking Srebrenica and Zepa, there's no
doubt the Serbs will head for Goradze next. That's unfortunate for the
town's 60,000 inhabitants, who will soon be on the road to the refugee
camps of central Bosnia, and for the 400 British troops left stranded
there by their Government's and their allies' pusillanimity.
We must hope Mr Major, Mr Portillo, and Mr Rifkind have some sort of a
plan to get them out that will not entail total humiliation, but I
wouldn't count on it.
The weekend meetings between British, French, and American generals
and ministers showed clearly that all they wanted, individually and
severally, was to blame each other. The French were accused of bluster,
the British of cowardice, and the Americans of terminal indecision. All
are guilty as charged, of course.
The excuse I liked best came from the Americans: Gen Shalikashvili,
chief of the joint chiefs of staff, said the US couldn't ferry French
and British troops into Goradze because the President would have to ask
Congress first.
He has to do no such thing, but it'll do as an excuse. Mr Clinton will
blame Congress for his own wishy-washiness. The French blame the
Americans, on the grounds they can't act without them, and the British
Government will blame everyone except itself. Then the Serbs will occupy
Goradze.
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb gauleiter, has laid claim to the
three eastern enclaves. The fact the present occupants and their
ancestors have lived there since time immemorial is no concern of his.
Then come further questions. The Serbs want Goradze because it is on
the Drina, in territory now wholly Serb, and because it sits astride the
main road from Serbia proper down to the coast. There are ports in
Montenegro, but they would prefer Dubrovnik. So perhaps it, and Mostar,
will be the next targets, after Goradze.
Mr Karadzic says Sarajevo must be divided into Muslim and Serb cities.
If the Muslims disagree, then the Serbs will take it all.
Lastly, there is the battered enclave in the west of Bosnia, Bihac.
When that's gone, Greater Serbia will be complete, with a rump state of
1.5 million Muslims harmlessly isolated in the middle, at the Serbs'
mercy.
They would probably want to enlarge the corridor north of Tuzla, to
improve communications between the west and east of their new empire --
and then they will doubtless agree to a peace treaty with all the
trappings. It might all be accomplished this autumn.
On present form, the whole alphabet soup of Unprofor, Nato and the UN
won't stop Karadzic. If he can have Goradze, why not Sarajevo? One would
hope Greater Serbia would remain ostracised and isolated, excluded from
the economic benefits flowing from the European Union. In the very long
run, that might have some effect.
It would not be a great consolation to the wretched refugees, packed
into their mini-state in central Bosnia.
It won't be much of a consolation to the rest of us, either. What's
the point of debating the possibility of a common currency when we can't
agree on keeping our most solemn promises to the safe areas of Bosnia?
What's the point of preserving Nato when it can be scorned and
humiliated by a thug like General Mladic? And what are the Americans
doing in Europe, anyway?
Our Bill has always hated foreign affairs. An elderly Californian
lawyer and a New England farmer, Warren Christopher and Anthony Lake,
have been given the remit to keep the US and its President out of
trouble.
Now President Clinton is completely paralysed by the Republican
Congressional victory last November. His only concern is to position
himself for the next election, in November 1996. It will serve him
right, not to mention the British Government, if the Serbs push their
luck and behave so outrageously when they take Goradze that there will
have to be some sort of intervention.
General Shalikashvili needs Senator Robert Dole's permission to fly a
helicopter into Goradze to rescue its inhabitants. We'll see if he needs
to ask permission to rescue the British contingent. If he does, then
we'll also see what the man who wants to be President would actually do
in a crisis.
Whether that means saving Nato or burying it remains to be seen. It
means burying the UN, too, or at least its collective security
commitments. As for the EU, the Euro-sceptics can take comfort that it
will never amount to anything, let alone subvert British sovereignty. Of
course, with British troops left by their own Government to the mercy of
the Serbs, British sovereignty may not be worth very much, either.

IN celebration of 300 proud years of epistles beginning ''Dear Sir,
With regard to your application for an overdraft, I regret'', the
National Library of Scotland is running an exhibition entitled ''Money
Matters -- the Bank of Scotland and Scottish Banking 1695-1995''.
This is full of fascinating stuff and, unlike most things connected
with banking, absolutely free. Touring the show in search of souvenir
samples, we were especially interested in an item describing the great
Ayr Bank bankruptcy of 1772, a disaster tending to indicate that
Scotland's reputation for financial wizardry might just be ill-founded.
Backed by the dukes of Queensberry and Buccleuch, the bank had, using
the nobs' estates as security, issued rather more notes than it actually
had the cash to support. This happens to the best of us, the Diary not
least, but such was the stramash in Ayr that debts were still being paid
off -- couldn't have happened to nicer peers -- two generations later.
The point of this tale, for students of recent political history, is
the name of the bank's adviser. Chap named Adam Smith, apparently, an
economist to trade, whose influence on recent Conservative chancellors
has not been slight.
. . . in for a pound
STILL, given all the recent fuss over executive pay, it seems to us
that our modern captains of industry could take a leaf from the ledgers
of the men who founded the Bank of Scotland. They called themselves
''adventurers''. If nothing else, it was a cut above ''chief executive
of a major utility''.
Beneath surface
THE Forth River Purification Board is feeling very pleased with
itself. Its most recent annual report states that between 1990 and 1995
there was a 30% reduction in polluted ''freshwaters'' in the area and a
threefold increase in ''class 1'' unpolluted waters in the Forth
estuary. Jolly good.
We couldn't help but notice on a recent daunder through picturesque
Cramond Village, however, that the old signs along the foreshore have
been somewhat amended. Once upon a time they simply told you not to be
so stupid as to eat the local shellfish. Now they add, in so many words,
that a swim is out of the question and even a wee paddle is under no
circumstances to be thought of.
What's out there? Jaws? Evidence to the Scott inquiry? The collected
speeches of Michael Forsyth? A day at the beach; nothing like it.
Money down drain
STILL with odd odours, we hear there's been a bit of a stink in Kelso,
where #1.4m has been spent improving a sewage treatment plant and
residents (of Kelso, not the plant) are still complaining about the
stench.
According to locals, the money hasn't been entirely wasted, however.
The stink goes on, but through the wonders of technology the plant is
now able to control the precise hour at which it decides to become
offensive.
Avoid, so we hear, between 8 and 9 at night.
Super swine
WHO COULD resist? Better than ''Man Bites Dog''; more improbable than
''Blair Woos Murdoch''; funnier than ''Major to Act''. From the front
page of the Oban Times: ''Pig flies on Mull''.
Memories of Tobermory persuade us that there may be little else for
pigs to do on Mull. Inside, however, the paper explains that Stumpy and
Smokey are a pair of Kune Kune pigs residing at the smallholding of
Diana MacFarlane and Angus Black and that Stumpy recently astonished his
owners by doing a runner and leaping ''a wide burn a deer would have
thought twice about''.
The pigs (its says here) are also fond of extra-strong Polo mints and
grass. That's your green, common-or-garden grass, by the way.
* ALMOST as engaging as surface-to-air pigs is the East Lothian
Courier's report on activities at the beloved local nuclear power
station. ''Biker Mice from Mars at Torness fun day'', says the headline.
Now if it had been two-headed Biker Mice from Mars there might have
been something to worry about.
Sick in unison
DISTRESSING NEWS back in the Borders, where a survey conducted by
Borders General Hospital concludes that levels of stress among staff are
unacceptably high. Ninety five per cent of workers responded to a
questionnaire recently and confirmed that morale is ''poor'' while
complaining ''of being undervalued''. The health workers are, so to
speak, sickened.
Now, it might just be us, but isn't there just possibly a connection
between this sad state of affairs and the fact that Unison nurses in the
Borders have somehow got it into their heads that 3% isn't a decent pay
rise? Is the lack of proper share options to blame? Perhaps if someone
had taken the money spent on the survey and offered it to the staff
instead they wouldn't feel quite so undervalued.
Still, the Borders General Hospital Trust is on the ball. Wrestling
with the pay problem at a recent meeting, board chairman Alastair O'Neil
felt it necessary to ask just how many of his staff were members of
these union things.
Tavern tour
RETURNING to the capital, we are in receipt of a pamphlet entitled
McEwan's Tavern Tour Guide to Edinburgh. Aside from omitting the
apostrophe from the brewer's famous name, this useful document details
50 of Edinburgh's choicest establishments, thus enabling the social
drinker to know exactly where he or she is, if not how or why.
At the back of the book there is a page headed ''Approach to Tasting
Beer (Points to Look For)'' describing ''the Taste Experience'' and
including the curious claim, ''It's often said that consumers drink with
their eyes''.
This, we can only presume, is what is meant by ''blind drunk''.
The guide then goes on, in the most long-winded definition of
''rat-arsed'' we have yet encountered, to outline the four qualities
which go to make up flavour. Aroma we know of; Taste and Aftertaste are
concepts with which we are familiar. But ''Mouthfeel''? This is
described as ''body-fullness, mouth-coating, and syrupy sensations'',
whatever those are.
For our part we had always thought mouthfeel is precisely what you
don't have on the morning after an evening spent exploring 50 of
Edinburgh's finest old taverns. It's the mouth-coating, you see.
Learning fast
THE chaps from the London papers are catching on. The front page of
yesterday's ''Scottish'' Daily Mail led on the ''Greedy bosses pay
probe''. Its southern counterpart, much concerned with a story about
education in England, thundered: ''TEACH THEM HOW TO BE BRITISH''.
That, as they say, will learn them.

BRITAIN'S employers are wearing haloes this week. One lot, grouped in
the Greenbury Committee, have condemned the deadly sin of avarice among
their brethren, and suggested ways of curbing the desire of company
directors to pay themselves so much. Since the committee's collective
salary adds up to #4m a year, they must have deeper insight into the
cardinal virtue of temperance than the rest of us.
Another lot, the still weightier CBI, has warned of the deadly sin of
envy, though it did not put it in those terms. But that is what it
amounts to. Britain is a country given to periodic fits of morality.
Over nothing does moral indignation wax so fierce as over the fact that
some people have more money than others. There is a feeling, too, that
those with more have somehow taken it away from those with less, perhaps
a dying strain of exploded Marxist analysis. At any rate, the demand
follows that the state should step in to restore the balance. One
proposal for doing so is a minimum wage. The CBI cautions us that the
morality of this is not simple, and that the best-laid schemes often do
more harm than good.
Which of those two deadly sins, avarice or envy, is the worse? The
corporate scrabble for pay and perks in the past few years has not been
a pretty sight. But it must in part reflect the fact that during the
1980s Britain had the unusual experience of rapid growth, and became at
the same time a more inventive economy. We stopped unprofitable
activities and turned to profitable ones. In Scotland, for example, we
stopped building ships, making steel, and mining coal, which other
countries could now do better. Instead we turned to drilling for oil,
financial wizardry or manufacturing microchips, and became much richer
than if we had not.
Inevitably the benefits were unevenly distributed. The change came
about through private enterprise, through seeing opportunities and
seizing them. The reactions of people when presented with opportunities
vary as much as the colour of their hair or eyes. Some look and some
leap. If those who leap can expect no reward, which is anyway uncertain,
they will hardly bother. It is not avarice to reap that reward, or want
to keep as much as will be left of it after tax. Should the state
intervene further and try to ensure that each of us shuffles forward at
the same pace, there is no progress at all, as we saw before 1979.
That may explain the 1980s but not the 1990s, when despite recession
the scrabble for pay and perks has appeared to go on unabated, and to be
dismayingly successful for a lucky few. A furore has arisen, especially
over the privatised utilities, where indeed the conduct of the fattest
cats is defended by nobody but themselves. It is unfortunate that they
were mostly privatised as monopolies. Monopoly is the surest foundation
for the conspiracies against the public in which Adam Smith thought
merchants were constantly engaged.
But the unspoken message of the Greenbury Committee, it seems to me,
is that there is no magic wand that can be waved for an instant remedy.
We can fiddle about with tax breaks, impose somewhat tighter regulation,
in time break down the monopolies. But most companies are not
monopolies. They have to make their way in the market-place and, if they
overpay their directors for no corresponding achievement, they will
sooner or later be shoved out by leaner and fitter rivals. Yet, since
that market-place becomes more international with every passing day,
they also have to pay their directors enough to stop them being lured
away to greener pastures. It is a matter of judgment, which only the
companies are in a position to make.
The mistake would be to put the same straitjacket on them all, on the
normal competitive companies along with the monopolies, on the lean and
the fit along with the fat and the flabby. It would be the sort of
mistake we used to make before 1979, in a vain effort to ensure equality
of figure for everyone.
Similarly unspoken across the spectrum of business and politics is a
consensus on that. The committee in effect accepted that if companies
were unafraid of bad publicity, they could continue to pay their
directors what they liked. The Government received this conclusion with
relief. Even the Labour Party, while crowing over a concession to its
views on tax, went no further: not a word was said of wider controls on
pay or the general conduct of companies, let alone of renationalisation.
What Labour can do, of course, is exploit the fit of public morality
over all this, the more eagerly because it does not in the end mean to
do anything. In fact it is learning to live with avarice, if we may
judge from the statements of Tony Blair. He shows no sign of wanting to
run the British economy on anything else than the profit motive and
free-market principles, in a true continuation of Thatcherite
radicalism, as he put it to his Australian friends the other day.
But he is still tempted by envy, at least on other people's behalf. He
still thinks that if they choose to work for less than a figure set by
himself, they are having something taken away from them, which is his
duty to restore by means of a minimum wage. What he will do by barging
into such bargains between employer and worker is to ensure that the
bargains will not be struck, just as they would not be struck if they
barged into the bargains between the company and director. In the one
case the director would seek his greener pastures. In the other, the
worker will not get his job.

THE row over Labour's proposal to introduce a statutory national
minimum wage flared again yesterday after publication of a CBI report
suggesting that thousands of jobs could be lost if it was set too high.
The report claimed that a figure of #4.10 a hour, which is what
several trade unions are seeking, would cause job losses especially in
the textiles, clothing, and services sectors. However, in what might
prove a grudging acceptance of the principle of a national minimum, the
CBI report said a level of #3 would cause few problems for its members.
Not surprisingly, the report was seized upon by Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine, who said it highlighted the dilemma faced by the
Labour leadership.
Mr Heseltine said Labour leader Tony Blair had been forced by the
trade unions to promise a minimum wage, but was resisting pressure to
set a level until after the General Election because he realised the
potential impact on jobs.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ''If you set a rate above the
market level, you will threaten jobs and the further above the market
level you set it, the more jobs you will lose.''
He added that an effective minimum wage would also increase
inflationary pressures within the economy, because those on incomes
above the minimum demanded pay increases to compensate them when they
saw their differentials being squeezed.
However, Labour employment spokeswoman Harriet Harman pledged that
when the minimum wage was introduced it would be at a level which would
not threaten jobs.
Labour would set up a low pay commission with both employers and
unions to establish a mutually acceptable minimum. ''We will make sure
that it doesn't cost jobs. That is why we will have a low pay
commission,'' she said. ''I think in practice it will become a matter of
consensus.''
With more than a million workers paid less than #2.50 an hour, there
was a serious problem to be addressed. It was wrong that taxpayers, who
were currently paying #100 each and a total of #2400m, had to subsidise
low-paid staff through the benefits system.
The CBI director-general, Mr Howard Davies, later told a London
conference that a minimum wage would not solve the problems of poverty
and growing income inequality.
Data suggested that unemployment was a more significant cause of
poverty than low pay and the best way of tackling poverty was through
in-work benefits such as Family Credit, which tops up the earnings of
the low paid.
He also suggested that much of the benefit of a minimum wage would go
to second-wage earners from better-off households rather than boosting
the incomes of the low paid whose benefits were withdrawn as their
earnings increased.
The TUC general secretary, Mr John Monks, hit back by stressing that
there would be little public support for the CBI's self-interested
argument which accepted that the taxpayer should subsidise bad employers
through the benefits system.
The argument therefore was not against a national minimum wage but
against a benefit system that subsidised low pay. There was a role for
in-work benefits, but a national minimum would put a cap on state
spending and stop exploitation by Britain's worst employers.

A CONVICTED fraudster managed to get a #1000 grant to set up in
business after coming out of jail.
John Lippiat was so successful in telecommunications that he reached
the finals of the Young Scottish Businessman of the Year competition.
Yesterday, however, he was jailed for two years for the reset of
stolen property.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that hundreds of pounds worth of
British Telecom goods and equipment were found at his home and at his
business.
Lippiat, 26, admitted three charges of reset involving items worth
#3350.
Only a proportion of the articles stolen were found in the accused's
possession but he helped police recover the bulk of the other missing
items.
The Crown accepted his pleas of not guilty to other charges, including
the theft of #4300 in cash from a garage.
Temporary judge John Horsburgh was told that Lippiat, of Carrick
Place, Larkhall, had two previous convictions as a teenager involving
fraud.
Mr Jock Thomson, Advocate-depute, said Lippiat was given a #1000 grant
from the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust. He set up as a
self-employed telecommunications consultant in Merry Street, Motherwell.
Mr Thomson said: ''The accused was extremely successful and was
regarded as one of Lanarkshire's leading entrepreneurs.
''He won awards which qualified him for the Young Scottish Businessman
of the Year competition and reached the finals.''
Mr Thomson said there had been break-ins at BT telephone exchanges at
Kilsyth, Blantyre, Wishaw, and Bothwell.
Among the items stolen were printers, modems, fax machines,
oscilloscopes, telephones, a disk drive, and a keyboard.
Police found there had not been forced entry into the premises and
that the thief must have had keys.
Mr James Scott, defending, said a BT employee had approached the
accused, told him he was short of money, and asked him to keep the
stolen items for him.
''The accused did not attempt to sell one single article and was
responsible for the police recovering other stolen BT property worth
over #10,000,'' he said.

In the blue corner, the CBI. In the red corner, the trade unions.
Margaret Vaughan reveals a broad canvass of opinion on the minimum wage.
LOOK, it's really quite simple. A minimum wage either will or will not
cost jobs. A minimum wage can or cannot begin to solve the problems of
poverty. A minimum wage is or is not the way to tackle growing income
inequality. It just depends whom you listen to.
The trouble is that the noisy political squabbling between and within
opposing camps threatens to drown out serious debate by baffling
spectators with statistical waffle or leave them punch-drunk with
boredom.
Squaring up in the blue corner are the CBI, punching for the right of
employers to pay whatever level of wages they want. Stepping into the
ring yesterday to throw his weight behind their argument was heavyweight
Hezza, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, inveighing against the
threat to jobs, poking Labour in the eye with their refusal to set a
rate now, before the election.
Limbering up in the red corner are the macho trade unions, fighting
for an arithmetically nebulous #4.15 an hour, hurling nasty glances at
the bosses and trying to caw the nimble feet away from Labour's Harriet
Harman, Shadow Employment Spokesman. She is jabbing away at both right
and left, insisting that Labour will set up a low-pay commission with
both employers and unions to set a mutually acceptable minimum which
will not risk jobs.
Meanwhile, those cool-headed independent beings you might expect to
act as referees are involved in a dust-up of their own down on the
floor. The academics are pelting each other with weighty statistics,
throwing heavy tomes of research around, knocking each other out with
invective.
And it's all going to get worse, much worse, as the static of
political blather increases in inverse proportion to the time left
before the next General Election.
Step up, then, Professor Andrew Hughes Hallett. He is a macroeconomist
at Strathclyde University, who is not putting the boot in for either
side: ''There must be a price at which a minimum wage would cause
redundancies by driving up unit labour costs. However, there will be a
wage level at which it doesn't.''
Which is precisely the finding of the CBI research unveiled yesterday.
Its internally prepared paper contained evidence that a minimum of #4.10
an hour would cause substantial job losses and add #4.5 billion to
payroll costs.
But the paper also revealed that a modest floor of #3 an hour would
not result in redundancies or a significant hike in expense for
companies.
CBI director-general Howard Davies told a London conference that a
minimum wage would not solve poverty or reduce growing income
inequality. The data, he said, suggested that unemployment is a more
significant cause of poverty than low pay. Of the poorest tenth of
households only 15% include one or more people in jobs.
The best way of tackling poverty, he insisted, was through benefits
for those in work, such as Family Credit, to top up the earnings of the
low paid.
Some paradox there surely? Using taxpayers' cash to fund cheap labour?
Subsidising rapacious employers? ''Somebody has to pay to top up low
wages, through benefits such as family income support or whatever, which
presumably means taxation, has to be higher than it would otherwise
be,'' says Professor Hughes Hallett.
Some economic theorists challenge the free-market nostrums in the
debate, which hold that the price of labour is like the price of
potatoes; lower it and more is demanded, raise it and less is sought. A
survey of the labour market last year -- the Wage Curve, by David
Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald -- looked at the relationship between the
wages and employment of 3.5 million people in a dozen countries.
It found that employment is not highest where real wages are lowest.
Nor is it lowest where real wages are highest. The conclusions drawn
from the survey were that unemployment does not lower real wages to
price the unemployed into work; instead it exerted discipline on the
wages and behaviour of those in work. It is only if the demand for
labour rises that the unemployed find work.
The economic theory that tells us that a minimum wage destroys jobs
also took a bashing from a study in the United States which offered
evidence that a minimum wage for the low paid is an instrument for
promoting efficiency in the labour market and that where it is set at
reasonable levels it increases rather than reduces employment. Myth and
Measurement, by Professors David Card and Alan Kreuger of Princeton
University, provoked a fierce academic debate about whether or not an
18% increase in the minimum wage in New Jersey in 1992 raised
employment.
''How much of that research can be transferred to conditions over here
we don't know, because all sorts of other conditions in the labour
market may be different,'' says Professor Hughes Hallett.
He points out that the Dutch have had minimum wage legislation for
years. The government uses it as an instrument to control incomes
policy. Having set a minimum wage, the government restrains pay
increases by refusing to let it rise: ''It's a way of keeping
everybody's wages down, which I suspect is an argument that the CBI
hasn't thought of.'' Nor the trade unions, come to that.
He argues that there is an explicit strategy within government to keep
unit labour costs below that of other leading European producers: ''You
get this big argument about companies moving because of various
competing factors involving labour costs.'' For instance, labour costs
in the UK are around 75% of the German level: ''If Britain's labour
costs stay lower, the argument runs, an increasing amount of business
will shift towards Britain.''
In academic terms, it's called locational competition. In shopfloor
terms, it's called cheap labour. John Monks of the TUC argues that the
Government's belief that Britain can compete internationally as a
''bargain-basement'' economy is a misconception.
What British companies fear are those dynamic Asian economies whose
education and training levels exceed Britain's and whose wages are fast
catching up. To rely on in-work benefits to top up low pay is both
ineffective and ruinously expensive. It is, he claims, an open
invitation to bad employers to transfer the burden of low pay from their
firms to the taxpayer.
A minimum wage, he argues, would ''privatise'' the problem and provide
an incentive to boost training, investment, and productivity. He points
to the experience of major competitors, such as Japan, the US, and
France where a minimum wage has not lead to unemployment.
''A minimum wage has not been an economic disincentive in other
countries. Indeed, the employment record of deregulated Britain over the
whole economic cycle does not compare well with France or Germany.''
Aerospace, one of Britain's most successful sectors, pays an average
#7.91 an hour. Rover followed the high-productivity, high-reward path
with average pay in the motor industry of around #7.79 an hour.
While the Government argues that the minimum wage would inhibit
flexibility in the job market and deter employers from taking on new
workers, and the trade unions call for a minimum of #4 an hour, Labour
hold up figures which show that more than one million people in the UK
earn less than #2.50 an hour. Just over 300,000 earn less than #1.50.
Some commentators have pointed out that a minimum wage, pitched at the
right level, could price a lot of workers who have no incentive to work
for #1.50 an hour back into employment, thereby saving money shelled out
in benefits.
Harriet Harman says taxpayers have recently had to provide #2.44
billion for benefits to top up the income of those on low pay. This, she
claims, is an increase of 103% on the 1990 figure: ''It's entirely wrong
that the taxpayer has to subsidise low-paid staff through the benefits
system.''
Labour would set up a low-pay commission, with both employers and
unions, to set a mutually acceptable minimum dependent on economic
circumstances, after it comes to power: ''We'll fix a level and make
sure it doesn't cost jobs. I think in practice it will become a matter
of consensus.'' Maybe that depends where the knockout blow of an
election victory falls.

THREE cheers for Selina. The ice princess of Grampian Television has
proved she has some fire in her belly with her caustic response to the
verbal battering delivered by American billionaire Donald Trump,
following her interview with him shown on ITV last month. Greeting his
ghastly criticisms of her as ''sleazy'' and ''unattractive'' with the
mischievous appraisal that ''if you've got an ego as big as the Empire
State Building, you're liable to get upset if someone dents it'' has
given her image a much-needed dose of dynamism.
The sly simplicity of her statement effectively countered his
spluttering barrage. It was a nice touch of spin-doctoring which has
turned the spat between Scott and the trumped-up property developer into
the kind of PR opportunity which will have greatly enhanced her
notoriety in the States, where she is about to present a chat show on
NBC Super Channel.
But spare some sympathy for Donald. Sources who worked on the
programme might be suggesting a
hell-has-no-fury-like-a-billionaire-spurned type scenario, with their
insider gossip that Trump was initially ''knocked sideways'' by Selina,
but perhaps his invective was prompted by the rumours that Scott was
supposed to have ''hated the way he was always brushing his hair''.
Talk about below the belt; damning a chap for tonsorial concern.
Admittedly Trump's carefully set waves are a bit of a sartorial crime,
but at least the man is making an effort. What's a guy to do? Selina's
attitude is disturbingly typical of the majority of women who want their
men to be New but not too shiny. Raised on the teenage edict of ''never
trust a man who wears aftershave'' we retain a suspicion of fellows who
dare to pause in front of mirrors, even though we are genetically unable
to pass a reflective surface -- from shop windows to teapots -- without
a quick surreptitious glance.
I'm as guilty as Selina; happy to applaud equality for the sexes I
still feel faintly appalled when a man takes as long as I do to get
ready to go out, challenging my rightful dominance over the bathroom and
its contents. When it comes to guys, most women reckon a little vanity
goes a long long way. They're welcome to take an interest in washing and
ironing but could they please keep their noses out of the cosmetic
cupboard.
Next thing you know, calamity of calamities, most heinous of crimes,
they'll be using our razors, whining: ''Oh, but your Gillette
swivel-headed Sensor for Women is so much more suitable for my sensitive
skin.''
This is a key phase. We want men to be more sensitive regarding their
emotions -- ie, shut up, listen more, and apologise an awful lot -- but
we're not too chuffed about them having sensitive skin or limp hair.
Their skin should be tough, their hair buoyant. Ideally, we'd like them
to be soft and gooey on the inside but hard on the outside, not sitting
about slapping on Super Intensive Hand Cream.
When it comes to personal hygiene women send out confusing signals.
Sure we'd like men to smell nice and look good but this should be a
simple matter of soap and water and some decent deodorant. Our bathroom
cabinets might be stuffed to overflowing with such messy paraphernalia
as false eyelashes, tweezers, nail polish, fake tan, Immac, hair wax,
mousse, and fixing spray (well mine certainly is, I just checked) but
ideally men's bathrooms should simply store some carbolic soap, an
old-fashioned shaving set, and a tube of toothpaste. Deep down inside
women like to think that supermarket own-brand shampoo is the sign of a
real man, not a skinflint.
I've been to a guy's party where a group of girls gathered in his
bathroom to squeal with laughter and ridicule his extensive Body Shop
collection (you know who you are and we're sorry). Men get the message
loud and clear. These days it's OK to have Playboy on display; it's the
male toiletries which have to be hidden under the bed when a lady comes
a-calling.
It's hypocrisy to the nth degree and they're clearly sick and tired of
it. Francis Cottam, the strong-jawed, gym-going, all-round tough guy who
used to edit the macho glossy For Him magazine but who now holds the
editorial reins of Men's Health, recently railed against the perception
that men who pampered themselves were less than men. ''Real men in the
nineties do wear moisturiser and enjoy more than a passing acquaintance
with a mirror. The days when a man's bathroom cabinet contained nothing
more than a token bar of soap and some headache tablets to blot out a
hangover are long gone.''
Ooh er, that's us told good and proper. We'll have to learn that all's
fair in the struggle for mirror space and the war against ageing; both
sexes can take up tools to defy it. Selina will have to stifle her
prejudice against male wanton use of the hairbrush. We'll sit back and
smile indulgently while men perform ever more elaborate ablutions. Any
man in my life is welcome to shampoo, slap, pluck, and polish to his
heart's content -- as long as he keeps his manicured mitts out of my
elderflower eye gel. Let him buy his own.

<HEADLINE>Audit finds CSA assessment wanting</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977322204</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MORE than half the maintenance assessments carried out by the Child
Support Agency (CSA) last year were wrong, the National Audit Office
disclosed yesterday.
In a stark indictment the financial watchdog found only 47% of CSA
maintenance assessments were correct.
Errors -- which in the worst case led to a father paying out #55 a
week too much -- were found in 37% of cases and doubt was cast on a
further 17% where there was insufficient evidence to tell if the demands
were accurate or not.
Auditors found errors were made by staff even when they had enough
information to calculate the correct amount of maintenance.
Of these, half related to under-assessments -- the largest of which
was #19.41, with an average of #4.51. The remainder related to
over-assessments, the average being #10.40.
The audit office report, published on the same day as the CSA's annual
report, backs up its earlier, preliminary investigation, which found
more than half the assessments were probably wrong.
The CSA had been reformed after a disastrous beginning, dominated by
complaints of harassment and unfairness and accusations that it had
forced men to suicide.
The latest audit report revealed that around #76m was collected from
absent parents between 1994-95. However, over the period, the total cash
owing from them rose from #94.9m in March 1994 to #525.2m at the end of
March this year.
The audit office said the CSA had told it that a ''significant''
amount of debt was unlikely ever to be collected.
Of the #525m outstanding, around #439m is owed to the State and #86m
is due to parents caring for children.
The report also sets out examples of errors leading to wrong
assessments.
Staff are alleged to have used the wrong time periods to correct
average earnings; taken sick pay, overtime payments or holiday pay into
account, and had often miscalculated housing costs.
Other common errors included a failure to allow for council tax or the
shared cost of caring for children.
The report admits that, at times, parents must take some of the blame
for giving incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent information but CSA
staff are accused of going ahead with assessments even though they did
not have accurate information available.
As a result of the mistakes, Sir John Bourn, the Auditor-General, has
had to qualify the CSA's annual accounts.
Since the first audit office report last September, operational
changes and fundamental reforms, including a number of moves to improve
the accuracy of maintenance assessments, have been made by the CSA.
Mr Andrew Mitchell, Junior Social Security Minister, said ''clear
progress'' had been made but much still needed to be done. He added:
''There is still a long way to go before the agency is performing to the
standard we all seek -- providing a consistently good service to all its
clients.''
Last night, a spokesman for the Network Against the Child Support Act
(Nacsa), Mr Andy Farquarson, said the criticisms came as no surprise to
campaigners.
''This is the latest in a long line of reports which prove that the
CSA is inefficient, administratively choked, and unable to implement the
Child Support Act,'' he claimed.
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour spokesman for social security and MP for
Glasgow Garscadden, said: ''The agency has missed its targets by a mile.
''In its second year, it has directly collected only #76m and claims a
further #111m has been transferred between parents . . . these look
desperately inadequate figures when measured against operating costs of
#200m.''

Andrew Lothian shares the pleasure of truant reading
ALL lawyers who appear in court have to spend much of their time
looking up cases to see whether what has been decided before will cast
any light on present problems. For an opponent to come up with a
pertinent decision, which one has unaccountably missed, is the stuff of
legal nightmares.
It is a characteristic of the slow and logical growth of Scots law
that some of these cases are very old and it is all too easy, especially
if one is handling a volume published 200 or so years ago, to be
diverted into reading about things which have nothing to do with the
subject under consideration. It was in this way that I came to
appreciate that there are two particular pleasures from this sort of
truant reading.
The first is the incidental information which at times emerges about
the way people led their lives. The second is how a voice sometimes
seems to ring out loud and clear down through the centuries.
Here are some illustrations of the first.
In 1619 the Burgh of Haddington was so long without an executioner
(no-one wanted the job) that the King had to be petitioned to sanction
the appointment of the very person they had awaiting execution, one
Eliot, a sheep-stealer.
At a trial for murder in Jedburgh in 1674, the defence was not allowed
to lead the evidence of a female witness on the grounds that there was
no ''penuria testium tempora mortis'', in other words no shortage of men
who could say as eye-witnesses what had happened, women being thus
regarded as second-class witnesses, to be relied upon only in an
emergency.
In 1813 a mid-shipman, James Hendry, was tried on a charge of
murdering a girl of 15 who had been part of a crowd in Campbeltown
objecting to the activities of his Royal Navy press-gang, which was
recruiting, or as we would say today, kidnapping, canon-fodder for the
Napoleonic Wars. Six men had been impressed by the gang, but there was a
measure of local resistance and Hendry had ordered the firing of three
shots quite at random at the assembled locals.
The verdict of justifiable homicide has to be regarded as one of
political expediency, reached on the logical grounds that if the people
of Kintyre did not wish to be part of the solution they were to be
treated as part of the problem. Fifty years later, when a navy ship was
trying to suppress ''illegal'' trawling on Loch Fyne, live shots were
fired at a trawler from Ardishaig. One killed a crewman, but again the
verdict was not guilty, or anything at all. This does not seem to
represent much in the way of progress so far as the people of Argyll are
concerned.
At about the same time, up in Aberdeen, one Alexander Marshall,
accused of stealing and killing an ox, was taken into Aberdeen for trial
in an open cart ''wrapped in an oxhide by way of a greatcoat, with the
horns properly placed''. This has distinctly totemistic overtones, with
the accused man prepared for human sacrifice in order to atone for his
desecration of the god-beast. Even at a more prosaic level, the
juxtaposition of the accused and the evidence might be thought highly
prejudicial.
The mother of the girl killed by John Morrison of Cullen had second
sight and prophesied that ''the hemp never grew that would hang him''.
Nor it did. He changed his name, grew a long beard, and roamed the wilds
of Banffshire. His appearance was not improved by the fact that a wound
to his hand sustained in the fatal struggle would not heal and had to be
kept concealed in a ever-bloody cloth. He was sustained by country
people when they knew he was in the district, putting out bread and
cheese and milk for him at night, possibly out of compassion, more
likely in case he came into their homes and helped himself.
So far as the voices down the years go, here are some.
The last words of the young Laird of Dun, poisoned with the aid of a
witch by jealous relatives in 1613 were: ''Woe is me that I ever had
right of succession to any lands of Irvine, for had I been born some
poor cottar's son, I had not been so demanet, nor sic wicked practicks
plotted against me for my lands.''
Lucy Walker, a lady sentenced to an hour in the pillory by the
Aberdeen Magistrates in 1786 for keeping a bawdy house told the
assembled crowd: ''It's ill their part to use me this way, for there is
no any one of them that has not been well entertained in my house wi' aa
thing they wanted, except Provost Cruden, and I will except him.'' After
this she was, literally, drummed out of town and banished.
Some years later another victim of the Aberdeen pillory, Peter
Skinner, there for stealing silver buckles off a dead man's shoes, was
described by an eye-witness as making ''queer mouths and wry faces to
cause the spectactors to laugh, in which attempt he was pretty
successful'' -- a stand-up comedian, in fact.
Lord Kames, the judge, sentencing an old man called John Blaw to
death, did so with tears in his eyes, remarking that his task was made
all the more painful by the fact that they had been schoolfellows
together. Blaw received the sentence with equanimity. There is a
tradition, recorded by a later judge, Lord Sands, who had it from a man
who knew people who remembered the trial, that, with the connivance of
the hangman, Blaw, a celebrated Jacobite, survived the gallows by means
of a contrivance which prevented the rope throttling him.
Such a feat was said also to have been accomplished by Deacon Brodie,
the Edinburgh bailie who furnished houses by day and burgled them by
night. In gratitude for his posthumous services to Scottish literature,
for he was not only the inspiration for Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde but
also the putative ancestor of Dame Muriel's Miss Jean, we must hope that
he did indeed cheat the wuddie.

Stephen McGinty reflects on Robbie Williams' departure from Take That.
WHERE were they? The thousands of bewildered fans waiting outside
record stores for confirmation that it wasn't true, that it couldn't be,
that Robbie Williams had NOT left Take That. There should have been a
candlelit vigil, a chorus of 12-year-olds singing Could It Be Magic,
just as Robbie did three years ago to launch the Mancunian lads into
superstardom.
Everyone The Herald spoke too turned out to be fans of Oasis, Blur or
East 17. ''You're jokin!'' spat back one tiny teenager in tight black
jeans and more rings than fingers, when asked if she was a fan. ''But
Robbie,'' we replied. ''Don't you care that he's, well, gone.'' ''No,''
was the pert reply, then she was away to look at the pictures of Pulp.
Outside Virgin on Glasgow's Buchanan Street, Michelle McCleland, 14,
explained that she wouldn't miss Robbie as he didn't miss her. She tried
to get a picture and autograph at Barcelona Airport last summer. ''He
wasn't very nice and wouldn't talk to us. Take That are just
show-offs.''
True. But when your single sales beat The Beatles, The Rolling Stones
and Elvis, surely you can afford to be. When Back For Good was released
it became the band's sixth consecutive No 1, racking up sales of more
than 300,000. In the past three years, Take That have taken off.
The departure of Robbie Williams, 21, from the band yesterday to
pursue a solo career was broken in an exclusive article in the Sun. But
the story was also extensively covered by both television and radio,
where it overshadowed Bosnia, the Greenbury Report and impending rail
strikes.
''Well it's obvious why it's a story. It's all about celebrity, not
talent. It's like the Hugh Grant story, nobody really should have cared,
but everyone still did. There is a degree of summer madness in the
prominence the story has been awarded, though,'' said Steve Sutherland,
editor of NME.
''At this time of year anything goes. But it's not as if the band have
folded. He wasn't the singer/songwriter. It's a bit like Andrew Ridgeley
leaving Wham.''
So who was Robbie Williams? In a band of five pretty boys with a young
fan following, it's easier to define him as who he was fancied by. If
Mark is the little boy lost, Howard is the grunger, Gary's the boy next
door and Jason appeals to men, then Robbie was the wild joker of the
pack, attractive to women in their late teens and early twenties.
Although a fine singer and formidable dancer, what distanced him from
his colleagues was his dogged determination to buck against the barriers
placed before him by the band's creator and manager, Nigel Martin-Smith.
Rules such as no regular girlfriends -- lest the little girls be
disappointed -- and no constant partying ground him down. So after a
reported chat with George Michael about his career options, Robbie took
his advice and split.
He was the brightest in the band. His shaven-haired antics might not
have been the most concrete of proof, but his stint last year presenting
The Big Breakfast demonstrated his television potentional. ''Mark comes
across as thick as porridge but very sweet, Robbie's the one with the
brains,'' said Karen Lury, lecturer in film and television studies at
Glasgow University.
She is doing research into Take That and their fans. ''Take That is
bigger than Nirvana in this country. Kurt Cobain's death would probably
not have been as noticeable in comparison. Take That are now a British
institution.''
Lury doesn't mind his move. She fancies Gary.
So the concerts will continue -- 10 in Manchester, 10 in London, none
in Scotland -- and so will the hit singles and best-selling albums, and
Robbie will wander out of the limelight a pop star and return a TV
presenter.
In HMV yesterday, by the Take That section, there were no fans looking
for answers, no-one walking sadly by, wiping away a tear and mouthing:
''Robbie -- why?'' But there was an older man in a suit browsing through
The Temptations. So The Herald asked him.
His reply: ''Robbie who?'' Exactly.

THE killers of a nine-year-old boy were cursed in church yesterday as
the victim was finally laid to rest.
A family friend, known as Bobby, told the funeral service of Daniel
Handley in Dagenham, London:''I know this is a church but I hope the
bastards that did it get kicked to death every day they live.''
The funeral took place nine months after Daniel went missing from his
home in Beckton, east London, while out riding his bike. His body was
discovered in a shallow grave near Bristol in March.
The service at St Mary's was conducted by the Rev Don Jones, who
admitted the community could not forgive the youngster's killers.
Nevertheless, he prayed: ''The hurt and anger just seemed too great
but, for now, we ask You (God) to do for us what we cannot do for
ourselves -- to forgive those who committed this crime.''
Daniel was given an emotional send off. Four horses with black plumes
pulled a glass carriage containing his coffin through the streets of
east London to Dagenham.
On top was a red and white wreath in the shape of a guitar -- a
reminder of the reward originally offered to Daniel by friends in the
hope that he would ring home.
The cortege went by North Beckton primary school, pausing briefly so
Daniel's schoolmates could pay their last respects, before continuing to
Rippleside Cemetery in Barking.
Two men have appeared in court charged with Daniel's murder.

Dover House, Michael Forsyth's new London base, has a colourful past.
GLADSTONE turned up his nose at the very prospect that this imposing
building should become the official residence of the Prime Minister. The
grandeur, he complained, would oblige him to receive. He much preferred
his privacy.
Thus, while the President of the United States has the White House and
the President of France the Elysee Palace, John Major has an office and
home down a London side road.
On the other hand, Michael Forsyth, Secretary of State for Scotland,
has at his disposal Dover House, and without doubt even today it is the
most distinctive and interesting building in Whitehall.
He is now prepared to open its doors to Scottish commerce, business,
and to good causes to take advantage of a magnificent building steeped
in history.
Such was the magnificence of Dover House in 1885 that it could not
escape the attention of the then Duke of Richmond and Gordon, arch-Tory,
first Secretary of State for Scotland, and owner of the two best salmon
rivers in the country.
He knew it would be a prize catch and he made the best of his
opportunity when sharing a railway carriage with the then Lord
Salisbury. It would, declared the Scottish Secretary, make the ideal
office for his new ministry.
Salisbury, no doubt fortified by congenial company, could see no
problem in that. However, the Duke was taking no chances. He ensured
that the deal was secured there and then by hastily drawing up a
contract on a scrap of paper and insisting it be signed before the
journey's end.
It was entirely appropriate that Dover House should fall into Scottish
hands in this manner. The present building stands on almost the same
spot as ''the Cockpit'', the court theatre of the one-time Stuart Palace
in Whitehall, which in the summer of 1706 was the forum for the
negotiations leading to the Union of Parliaments.
In the Cockpit, Queen Anne, seated in a great chair covered in crimson
velvet and gold lace, had proffered her ''ardent, good wishes'' for
success in the talks. The bribes contained in a pack of ''golden ware''
in trade offered to the Scottish nobles had ensured the outcome before
the discussions began.
The present Scottish Office building in Whitehall began in the
mid-eighteenth century as a private residence for Sir Matthew
Featherstonehaugh, MP for Portsmouth.
Next tenant was the Marquis de Noailles, the French Ambassador. He was
entirely happy with his home until war broke out between the countries
in 1778.
In 1787 HRH Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany -- son of George
III and the general who led his 10,000 men to the top of the hill and
brought them down again -- bought the mansion.
As originally built, Dover House was E-shaped with the principal rooms
facing Horse Guards Parade. Beyond that there were the most
breath-taking views of St James's Park.
However, the Duke of York engaged Henry Holland to enlarge and alter
the building. It was he who added the famous portico with four columns
which are now very much a Whitehall landmark. In the courtyard he built
a distinctive domed and pillared rotunda which forms the main entrance
hall.
Thus the scene was set for what were probably the building's most
interesting and volatile occupants.
It was purchased by the Hon William Lamb, later to become the second
Viscount Melbourne, Prime Minister in the early years of Queen
Victoria's reign, and his wife Lady Caroline Lamb.
Her torrid two-year relationship with Lord Byron was the talk of the
town. The poet had a club foot and to assist him en route to her
chambers, Lady Lamb had staircase ropes set into the walls. They are
still there to this day and yesterday Michael Forsyth was at pains to
point them out.
Those who work in Dover House insist that Melbourne's deep angry voice
can still be heard echoing around the rotunda as he bellows at his wife:
''And he won't even have you! Damn You!''
Lady Caroline's life came to an end in a bedroom overlooking Horse
Guards Parade with what was then Buckingham House in the distance.
Melbourne could no longer live there and the building, which over the
years had been known by many names, took on its present address from
Lord Dover, a commissioner of woods and forests, who purchased it from
Lady Caroline's widowed husband.
Today Dover House is very much a working office. Tourists having had
their picture taken standing beside the Queen's men and Queen's horses
of the blues and royals, read the brass ''Scottish Office'' plaque on
the building next door, shrug their shoulders, and pass by.
But for Gladstone, it might have been the official London residence of
the Prime Minister but they don't know that.
Those who do venture into Dover House on official business come across
a hugely unimpressive, almost seedy, reception area.
However, if they get beyond that they are into the rotunda and one of
the most impressive buildings in Whitehall. Michael Forsyth asks if I
have seen the Secretary of State's office before and leads me in. Surely
even Michael Heseltine can be doing no better?
''You haven't brought a tape measure?'' he asks with a degree of
alarm.
Mr Forsyth explains that he had invited ideas from all corners of
Scottish opinion. The first, he said, came from the former SNP MP and
now broadcaster Margo MacDonald. She had suggested opening up Dover
House as a London shop window for Scotland.
It was, he said, an admirable suggestion which he was now adopting . .
. on the proviso there would be no cost to the taxpayer.

A NEW campaign to halt the sale of Forestry Commission woodland was
launched yesterday by Britain's leading countryside groups.
The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) has linked
with the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) and its
Welsh counterpart to ask the Government: ''When will creeping
privatisation end?''
They point out that more than 11,200 hectares of public woodland were
sold to the private sector last year and 8000 hectares are presently up
for sale. The majority of the land is in Scotland.
Mrs Elizabeth Garland, director of APRS, said: ''Past woodland
disposals could be justified on grounds of rationalisation of the
commission's estate. But there is concern that future disposals should
not deflect the strategic long-term management objectives of the
commission, nor diminish existing environmental benefits.
''We are not against rationalisation but we want an indication of the
predicted FC sales for the next decade.''
CPRE's land use campaigner, Ms Sian Phipps, said: ''The disposals
target is no longer appropriate. Until the commission can properly
protect the environment and access benefits of ex-commission woodland
the disposals programme should be halted pending a full review.''
Labour's Scottish environment spokeswoman, Ms Maria Fyfe, said she
would write to the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth,
asking him to examine the figures.
She said: ''We have to ask what is happening to woodland that goes
into private hands on such a massive scale.''
The Scottish National Party's environment spokeswoman, Ms Roseanna
Cunningham, backed calls for a halt to the sale of FC land to private
owners. She said: ''This should be stopped until the whole issue of land
ownership in Scotland is dealt with.''
The Forestry Commission points out that the disposal programme
involves less than 5% of its holding and that it is still acquiring and
planting land.

THE new Board of Trade President, Mr Ian Lang, last night disclosed
that he will withdraw from Lloyd's underwriting at the end of this year.
Mr Lang, the former Scottish Secretary, said in a Commons written
reply that in his new Cabinet role he would not deal with matters
concerning the insurance market until he was clear of his active
involvement in it.
He stated: ''I am an underwriting member of Lloyd's for 1995 and I
have instructed my underwriting agents to give immediate notice that I
shall cease underwriting at the end of 1995.
''Until such time as my outstanding open syndicate commitments have
been closed, I have instructed my officials and ministerial colleagues
not to brief me on Lloyd's issues and I shall stand aside from all
decisions concerning Lloyd's.''
He said Trade Minister Anthony Nelson would be responsible for Lloyd's
affairs.

FORMER Minister Sir Geoffrey Pattie yesterday announced that he would
be standing down as an MP at the next General Election. Sir Geoffrey,
59, a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party who helped mastermind the
Tory election victory in 1992, has represented the ultra-safe seat of
Chertsey and Walton since February 1974.  The constituency is to alter
substantially under forthcoming boundary changes, but at the last
election he defended it with a 22,819 majority. Sir Geoffrey said: ,
said: ''I have been a Member of Parliament for one of the best
constituencies in the country for over 21 years and the significant new
boundary changes have made me feel this is a good time to make way for
my successor. ''I have many things I want to do outside Parliament.''

SUSAN SMITH drowned her two sons in a cold, calculated attempt to free
her to continue a relationship with the son of a wealthy industrialist,
a prosecutor told jurors.
One of Smith's lawyers, however, called last autumn's drownings a
failed suicide attempt as she ''tried to cope with a failing life''.
Opening arguments in the murder trial of Smith, 23, came after
testimony yesterday that she prayed and asked for a gun to kill herself
before she confessed on November 3 to rolling her car into a lake with
her sons, three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex, inside.
The prosecution's first witness, Shirley McCloud, said she was reading
at her home on October 25, the night of the drownings, when she heard a
muffled sound that she initially mistook for an animal.
As Smith came closer to the house, about 60yd from the lake, McCloud
said she recognised a human voice: ''It was kind of a sobbing and
wailing and hysterical: 'Please help me, please help me'.''
McCloud told the jury that Smith told her the same story that sent the
nation on a nine-day search for Alex and Michael.
''She said a black man jumped in her car at the red light in Monarch
and put a gun to her side and told her to drive. She said she drove down
the road and, after a little while, she asked him 'Why are you doing
this?' and he told her to shut up or he would shoot,'' McCloud
testified.
On cross-examination, McCloud said Ms Smith's story was ''unbelievable
and so shocking'' that she asked her to repeat it.
Smith faces two first-degree murder charges, if convicted she could be
executed.
Prosecutors maintain the crime was calculated, but defence lawyers
argue that Smith was mentally ill.
In opening statements earlier today, the prosecution stressed that
Smith kept up the fiction of the black carjacker for nine days.
''Susan Smith looked this nation in the eye and lied,'' said assistant
prosecutor Keith Giese, noting Smith's public pleas for the carjacker
not to harm the boys and for God to grant them a safe return.
He said the deaths were ''a conscious decision'' by Smith to get rid
of the boys in order to restore a broken relationship with the son a
wealthy textile company owner. Giese called the boys a ''stumbling
block'' for the 23-year-old former secretary.
However, defence lawyer Judy Clarke told the court Smith ''snapped''
on October 25 and detailed the long turmoil in her life before that
night.
Clarke described the impact her father's suicide had on Smith as well
as her own suicide attempts, and the fact that she was sexually molested
by her stepfather.
She read a portion of Smith's confession in which she said: ''I
dropped to the lowest when I let my car go down that ramp without me.''
''She believed the children should go with her, but the body wills to
live, and Susan jumped out of the car. Once the car began rolling, those
children were lost and Susan's life was lost,'' the lawyer said.
Smith ''tried to cope with a failing life and she sinned,'' said
Clarke. ''Susan Smith accepts responsibility for what she's done.'' --

DIVINE Brown, the Hollywood prostitute arrested last month with
British actor Hugh Grant, pleaded not guilty today to a charge of lewd
conduct stemming from the incident.
Brown, 25, whose real name is Estella Marie Thompson, appeared at the
Hollywood Municipal Court with her lawyer, Richard Nahijian, who said
she would seek a jury trial.
A smiling Brown, dressed in an expensively tailored, low-cut black
suit, said nothing during the hearing and at Nahijian's brief news
conference afterward.
Court commissioner Robert Sandoval ordered her to appear at a
pre-trial hearing on August 18 and to post $25,000 bail, reduced from
$30,000, for two charges of probation violation stemming from earlier
prostitution convictions.
The hearing attracted about 50 reporters and cameramen who fell over
each other as sheriff's deputies struggled to maintain order when Brown
arrived and departed in a late-model Mercedes-Benz with Nahijian and two
others.
Asked at the news conference why Brown would not plead ''no contest''
as Grant did last week, Nahijian said: ''She's not Hugh Grant.'' He
declined to say whether the actor would be called as a witness at the
trial.
Grant and Brown were arrested by Los Angeles vice squad officers on
June 27 as Brown allegedly administered oral sex to the actor, best
known for his role as a shy bachelor in last year's hit movie, Four
Weddings and a Funeral.
They were both charged with lewd conduct. Grant, currently starring in
Nine Months, was supposed to appear at the same hearing but his lawyer
got the date brought forward by a week and pleaded no contest on his
behalf.
Grant was fined $1180, placed on two years' probation and ordered to
undergo Aids education.
Brown, meanwhile, sold her story to a London tabloid for a reported
$160,000, saying Grant told her he had fantasized about having sex with
a black woman. She also claimed not to know that her client was a famous
actor.--Reuter.

FINES of #1m or more should be imposed on newspapers which intrude on
people's privacy, a senior Tory MP said yesterday. Mr Roger Gale,
chairman of the Conservative backbench media committee, said the Press
Complaints Commission must be prepared to get tough with papers which
step out of line.  His comments came after the National Heritage
Secretary Virginia Bottomley on Monday ruled out legislation to curb
intrusive behaviour by the press. Mrs Bottomley angered many MPs when
she said it would be too difficult to frame laws outlawing the use of
electronic eavesdropping and telephoto lenses and trespass on to
people's property by the press.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama offered formal apologies to
Second World War ''comfort women'' today, saying his country's wartime
sex atrocities were ''inexcusable''.
The women were forced into service in brothels run by the occupying
forces of the Imperial Japanese Army across the Pacific basin.
Historians say as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans but also
including women from the Philippines, Indonesia, China, and the
Netherlands, were plucked from Asian cities to serve as sex slaves for
Japanese troops.
''I offer my profound apology to all those who, as wartime comfort
women, suffered emotional and physical wounds that can never be
closed,'' Murayama said in a statement.
The apology came on the eve of the establishment of a fund made up of
voluntary contributions from the Japanese public to compensate former
''comfort women''.
Japan set up the fund to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the
Second World War.
''The scars of war still run deep in Asian and other countries to this
day. The problem of the so-called wartime comfort women is one such
scar,'' Murayama said.
Scores of women from South Korea, the Philippines and elsewhere in
Asia have brought their cases to Japanese courts, demanding official
apologies and compensation.
Japan, after years of stonewalling, only recently officially
acknowledged the existence of the comfort women.
But Tokyo maintains that the question of war reparations was settled
under the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed in 1951, and subsequent
bilateral treaties.
Asian governments such as China and South Korea have accepted Tokyo's
stance on state-to-state reparations, but have said they would not stop
their citizens from seeking redress from Japan individually.
The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), quoting some of the
women involved, called the private fund ''a crafty and foolish trick to
avoid the state liability for the past crimes and tone down the
increasing public criticism with a few pennies collected from its
people.
''The Japanese government can never avoid its liability for the past
crimes,'' it said.-- Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Skye bridge builders claim #5m</HEADLINE>

THE builders of the Skye bridge are pursuing a compensation claim
against the Scottish Office which could see the taxpayer paying nearly a
third of the original estimate for the flagship free-enterprise project.
The Miller Dywidag consortium argues that the public inquiry into the
project caused unexpected delays which meant some work planned for the
summer was pushed back into winter. However, local people last night
described the move as a scandal while Labour called it ''an unholy
mess'' which it would pursue.
When Miller Dywidag won the tender in April 1991, the cost was
reported as #18m, with the Government contributing #6m towards the
approach roads. Industry sources now suggest the Miller Dywidag claim is
for a minimum of #5m.
In fact, the public inquiry in Kyle of Lochalsh under Reporter Miss
Elizabeth Haran sat on only nine days, between January 28 and February
7, 1992. The Scottish Secretary had called it on November 28, 1991, more
than two weeks before contracts with Miller Dywidag were signed on
December 16.
Mr Lang gave the bridge the go-ahead on June 24, 1992, although
without the subsidies to keep toll levels down as recommended by Miss
Haran. Several days before his announcement, MPs wanted to know why
Miller Dywidag employees had started work on the bridge.
A Scottish Office spokesman confirmed yesterday that the consortium
was making a claim but suggested this was largely due to design changes.
''Detailed examinations of the Skye bridge at the public inquiry led
to changes to the design, in particular those requested by the National
Trust for Scotland (and recommended by the Reporter at the inquiry).
Changes were also made to protect wildlife such as otters.
''The agreements between the Secretary of State, the developer, and
the contractor provide cost adjustments and penalties in the event of
changes to the design and delays to the start or the completion of
construction.
''The contractor has a claim under these provisions. However, it is
unlikely that agreement will be reached until construction is completed.
Any such claims will have no effect on the level of tolls or the length
of the tolling period.''
He agreed this meant that, if the claim was successful, it would be
met out of general Scottish Office funds. He could not comment on the
value of the claim.
Mr Bob Wilson, Miller's director of civil engineering, said: ''I did
not know the Scottish Office was making that statement. The matter of
the final cost is something which still has to be resolved between
ourselves and the Scottish Office.''
Mr Wilson agreed the company knew there would be a public inquiry when
they signed the contract: ''We did but we expected, with our contracts,
to start work by April 1992. In the event, the public inquiry took far
longer and we didn't start till July. There was some extra cost with the
design changes we had to make but the bulk was caused by the delay.''
The treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, Mrs Kathleen MacRae,
said last night: ''The whole thing is quite scandalous. There weren't
any unexpected delays. In fact, what we had was a timetable, dictated
purely by the timing of the last election. This rushed through the
planning of one of the most important engineering projects in Scotland
this century at a quite lunatic pace.
''They couldn't even wait to see if the Highlands would win Objective
One status which could have seen Europe paying for much of the project,
rather than the people of Skye having to pay the highest tolls in
Europe. It was a little over six months from signing the contracts to
beginning work, just 14 months since it went out to tender.
''Unexpected delays? Who are they trying to kid? We were always told
that one of the great advantages in this privately financed project was
that the builders were taking all the risks. But it seems it was the
taxpayers all along that were doing that regardless of what Mr Michael
Forsyth is now claiming.''
Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish, meanwhile, called on the
Government to resist the claim. ''If this is to be a model for further
developments like this, the Government clearly must think again.
''You cannot put a price on democracy which the public inquiry affords
and you cannot have the public purse once again ripped off to bail out a
so-called privately funded project, particularly if it has been due to
Government incompetence. We will need answers.''

Ross Harper describes the role and new initiatives of the
International Bar Association
THERE have been three United Kingdom presidents of the International
Bar Association in its 50-year history. It is perhaps significant that
one of them was English and two were Scottish.
I had three things going for me -- I had formerly been president of
the Law Society of Scotland. Secondly I have been the chairman of one of
the major sections of the IBA. Thirdly, I was not English!
The association has representatives from 167 countries and through the
national bar associations can claim to represent two-and-a-half million
lawyers. Who on earth would believe that there are two-and-a-half
million lawyers throughout the world?
A Scot has the best of all worlds. He is able to tell anti-English
jokes and even the occasional joke about the Scots. While the latter may
liven up an audience, the former may wow them.
And of course the old Scottish jokes still go down well. What happened
when two taxis collided in Aberdeen? Fifty-four people were injured! The
most recent Scottish joke I have picked up and re-tell with gusto is of
the crowd in a public house in America where beer was being sold at five
cents a pint to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. The Scotsman was
sitting alone and drinkless and, on inquiry being made, stated that he
was waiting for ''happy hour''.
The IBA has two discrete and parallel activities. It has some 16,000
individual members who meet from time to time and place to place (they
met recently in Edinburgh) discussing matters of common concern and
interest -- legal aid, family law, children's law, maritime law, patent
law, banking law, and the like.
There are literally hundreds of specialist committees where lawyers
from all over the world meet one another to discuss at an extremely high
level their common problems and common approaches.
Each lawyer is able to build up a network of worldwide contacts with
those who have similar interests and similar specialisation. This of
course is good for the international client who is assured of worldwide
representation should the occasion demand.
The other side of the IBA is where bar leaders meet with the
individual section officers and rule the association through a council
-- which in turn elects a management committee and the officers.
The headquarters are in London and there are some 40 of a staff
ranging from human rights experts to conference organisers.
In practice, invitations to conferences abroad have to be ruthlessly
selected and priorities have to be set. During this year for instance, I
declared 1995 to be the Year of Africa in as much as I felt that while
African lawyers were prepared to travel abroad we did not organise
sufficient events within Africa -- nor were we prepared to travel there.
But that has now changed and it is particularly pleasing that a
president from Scotland which has so many African connections should in
fact start this initiative.
I have already been in Kenya and Nigeria. I am going to Uganda in July
and Namibia, Swaziland, and South Africa in November. I have also sent
an American lawyer to Ghana.
In South Africa Nelson Mandela will be giving a keynote address for
the twenty-fifth anniversary of our section on business law.
At these international conferences we discuss issues of great
importance to the host nation. In Kenya, for instance, we had a
wide-ranging debate on women's rights introducing some of the standards
throughout the rest of the world -- a matter of great surprise to many
of the Kenyans.
However, the main and recurring theme at conferences such as these is
the basic issue of human rights and the rule of law.
I am intending to set up, in October, a Human Rights Institute of the
International Bar Association and hope to raise a considerable amount of
money so that we may apply more resources on human rights.
Without law there can be no justice, without the rule of law there can
be no proper freedom.
It was the Attorney-General of Kenya who pointed out to his audience
that the Government must come more and more to recognise the importance
of the rule of law when requesting inward investment.
Companies will simply not invest in a country where there is no law,
no justice, no freedom, and no liberty.
Sound words, but unhappily there is much to be done and there is no
guarantee in many of the African states that the judiciary will be
independent or that trials will be fair and just.
But problems relating to the rule of law and the absence of freedom
are worldwide. When I visited Japan at the request of the Japan
Federation of Bar Associations, I was introduced to the substitute
prison system whereby accused persons may be held in custody for up to
23 days without proper access to a lawyer, without an indictment being
served, and without the opportunity to ask for bail.
It is perhaps not surprising therefore that the Japanese confession
rate is 95% and the conviction rate is 99.99%.
The argument is still raging in Japan about basic rights of suspected
persons but we believe that we have carried that battle on substantially
by visiting Japan and making direct approaches to governments and
political parties alike.
This month I attended a conference in Ankara which is organised by the
Ankara Bar and commend lawyers for their fortitude in so doing.
I am unhappy to say that Turkey is one of our ''best'' customers. We
have a large number of protests about abuse of human rights there.
Lawyers have been to the fore by banding into human rights action
groups. Unhappily these groups are often shut down and lawyers are
frequently arrested.
One sees clearly throughout the world that it is lawyers who are the
last bastion of liberty.
In Uganda we are organising a Human Rights Workshop where we shall be
discussing all human rights issues -- independence of the judiciary,
independence of the bars, independence of lawyers, and the like.
The IBA, however, does not just confine itself to speeches, seminars,
and education. It is now taking a more proactive stance in world
affairs.
Recently in Edinburgh we called for the creation of a permanent
International Criminal Court. At a meeting in Paris in the autumn I am
proposing to put forward a motion about money laundering.
Money laundering is of course one of the evils of the modern
international scene. If those who made vast fortunes out of drugs and
other illegal and illicit activities were not able to spend their money
or bank it or reinvest it, then we are striking a great blow for the
ordinary citizen.
There are, unhappily, many other evils throughout the world. Women's
rights and protection against mutilation known (somewhat inaccurately)
as female circumcision requires interest and input from lawyers
throughout the world. One of the unhappiest situations arises where the
labour of children is exploited in contravention of the United Nations
Conventions. Again, lawyers have a role to play in the prevention of
this gross abuse.
I am declaring next year to be the Year of Latin America. The
International Bar Association has held a successful conference in Buenos
Aires some years ago but does not do enough in that Spanish-speaking
continent. In November, after South Africa, I am going to Quito in
Ecuador for two days and Rio for one-and-half days. Next spring I visit
Mexico and a number of other Latin American countries.
If there is a lesson to be obtained from my six months as president it
is simply that the problems in many countries throughout the world where
legal aid is unknown, where freedom of representation is not accepted,
where trials are neither fair nor free, where laws are ignored, and
where lawyers and law societies are controlled by the government, make
me more and more determined to ensure that the lawyers of fortunate
countries do spend time, energy, money, and resources in assisting
lawyers abroad.
Furthermore, the problems in other countries put everything at home in
perspective. Rather like the Chinese proverb -- the man who had no shoes
was unhappy until he saw the man with no feet.

AN ACCUSATION about the Leader of the Opposition being a transvestite
normally would have had the Commons in uproar. But a combination of
desperately muggy weather, glowering clouds and even more glowering
prospects in Bosnia, had taken the zing out of politics.
The claim by Mr David Sumberg (Bury South -- Con.) that Mr Blair had
been travelling round Australia ''passing himself off as Margaret
Thatcher'' raised a modest laugh on his own side and hardly a raised
eyebrow on Mr Blair's, where some may have found the description apt
enough.
Bright young Mr Keith Hill (Streatham -- Lab.) launched the
Opposition's umpteenth attempt to extract Mr Major's personal view on
whether Conservative MPs should be obliged to declare how much they earn
from consultancies.
''I thought you wanted to discuss the rail strike, but perhaps the
fact you are sponsored by RMT explains why you don't,'' said Mr Major.
Mr Sumberg's little joke came next. Mr Major reflected that as Mr
Blair had repudiated about 80% of the policies for which he once
campaigned he was likely, later on in his career as Leader of the
Opposition, to repudiate the same proportion of his current proposals.
Any hope of improving the standard of knockabout politics which used
to be a feature of the last Prime Minister's Question Time before the
lads and lasses headed for the summer beaches or the Tuscan villas was
dashed by Bosnia.
It being difficult to march determinedly through a quagmire, Mr
Blair's tough ''we must work out our bottom line and stick to it'' sank
under the weight of his necessary caveat, pursuing ''all practical
means.''
At the end of the day, the Western democracies lack the will -- to
take heavy ground troop casualties -- and, without the United States,
the means to make good any tough talk.
Mr Major clearly favoured trying to continue the UN's humanitarian and
peacekeeping work. However, he admitted it was becoming more hazardous
daily.
It was possible, he said, that the UN would have to withdraw and that
could lead to ''catastrophic'' consequences for Bosnia and the whole
region.
Britain and France, anyway, clearly fear a more general war dragging
in nations sympathetic to either Serbs of Muslims and do not have much
idea how it could be stopped.
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat's sensible deputy leader, avoided
the bombast Mr Ashdown, perhaps unconsciously, brings to the issue and
called sensibly for clear and achievable objectives.
Unhappily, his suggestion of defending a humanitarian route to
Sarajevo, though clear, was probably unachievable.
The Prime Minister then produced an axiom on which his Government for
creditable humanitarian reasons has been unwilling to act -- ''one
cannot mix war fighting with peacekeeping.''
He was then assailed from left and right. Mr David Winnick (Walsall
North -- Lab.) said the Bosnians felt deeply betrayed and demanded that
the current lot of war criminals should be brought to justice. Mr
Winston Churchill (Davyhulme --Con.) said ''the honour of Britain''
demanded that the safe haven of Goradze be saved.
Almost with relief it seemed the Prime Minister turned to rebutting
the charge that cack-handedness has returned to his administration with
a tax change that will actually penalise modest shareholders more
proportionately than the fat cats it was supposed to be aimed at. He
hardly did so convincngly but, at least, unlike Bosnia, it is something
the British Government can put right.

HIS tone was urgent and conspiratorial. His message: I was to go at

he to put British troops into disintegrating Yugoslavia.
He seemed to know what he was talking about. ''I am a Serb,'' he said.
''We hate peoples. We like killing peoples. If British troops sent, we
will kill them too.''
This was a mild and kindly Serb talking, recently arrived from
Belgrade with his pregnant English wife. He had landed a job at the
Garrick Club in London, where he delivered the warning -- the first of
many -- as he served the wine.
At that point, early in 1992, the Prime Minister was telling the House
of Commons that he was very much against putting troops on the ground in
the area. So I did not strive to get the message through to Mr Major.
Within three months, 2300 British troops were on their way.
Within a month, there will be 9000 there. I recall my Serb friend's
sombre concern as we now wonder about the future of 200 Royal Welch
Fusiliers and 100 Ukrainians in Gorazde facing 12,000 to 15,000
advancing and murderous-minded Bosnian Serbs. And what is to happen
about the so-called Rapid Reaction Force, still deploying oh-so-slowly?
Are they to fight their way in, or fight their way out?
This is the dilemma facing Mr Major's emergency conference of all
concerned in London on Friday. Do the Western powers enact a strategy of
peacekeeping in a more muscular fashion, with instant decision-taking
bypassing the unwieldy and incompetent United Nations hierarchy? Or do
they acknowledge, as Mr Major did yesterday in the Commons, that you
cannot fight a war and keep a peace, and that complete withdrawal is the
only answer left?
In the course of his reaction to the televised horrors of ethnic
cleansing, Mr Major has come into conflict with his chief allies. He was
against the European Union recognising Croatia, in the belief that it
would accelerate the break-up of Yugoslavia. However Chancellor Kohl
insisted and the rest felt obliged to follow.
President Clinton and the US Congress have constantly urged that
sanctions against Bosnia should be raised to enable them to obtain the
weaponry to match the Serbs' arsenal taken over from the Yugoslavian
army. Bitter debates have taken place between Mr Major and Mr Clinton,
the last of them by telephone on Friday, concerning this issue. It is
not yet settled.
Last week, we fell out with the French, whose new President Jacques
Chirac was urging immediate Anglo-French military action. Mr Major
argued that the practicalities were against it and that Mr Chirac should
contain his rhetoric. France and Britain are again united, if only
because of their anger with other nations who have not fulfilled their
commitments.
All concerned, including the Americans who have refused to commit
ground troops except to cover a withdrawal, are now staring humiliation
in the face. Once again, they seem in the final hours of this denouement
to be relying on the warring parties coming to their senses and
restoring a ceasefire and negotiations.
Mr Major's humanitarian instincts still drive him to hang on, trying
to get aid through to the suffering. His claim is that British
intervention alone has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. However he
is profoundly aware that the track record of the Bosnian Serbs is one of
exploiting situations to gain more territory. They know that the West is
not prepared to go to war, even to prevent the conflagration spreading
beyond the bounds of the former Yugoslavia.
It is a situation of multiple ironies, not least of which is the
position of Mr Malcolm Rifkind. Last week, he was mending fences with
the French; today, he is in Washington trying to do the same. His may be
the crucial role if it comes to withdrawal. He is entitled to a feeling
of deja vu.
He has been the least gung-ho member of the Cabinet. as Defence
Secretary he argued vigorously against committing British troops on the
ground. He took the view that you cannot do these things in half
measures and he was deeply sceptical about handing over control to the
United Nations. If Nato, including the USA, had agreed to put in a large
force at the outset to impose peace, he might have gone along with it.
But sending troops in dribs and drabs was in his view always going to
display a lack of will and commitment. He seemed to sense that lacking a
desire to find a political solution on the part of the various warring
factions, British troops would be ineffectual in helping to find one.
They would become embroiled in a too little action, too late syndrome.
Mr Rifkind was overruled. The Cabinet felt an overwhelming
responsibility to react to the atrocities. No doubt Mr Major himself
felt that if his ''safe havens'' for the Kurds against Saddam Hussein
had worked, they could work again in former Yugoslavia. To a certain
extent they have; central Bosnia is quiet.
There was another factor in British thinking. Our position as a
''world leader'', a country to be reckoned with at all levels, was
judged to be at stake. We have our permanent place (with its power of
veto) on the UN Security Council to safeguard against incursions by the
Germans and Japanese, who are demanding similar representation. Germany
even suggests that one place to represent the whole European Union would
be better.
Britain is still an atomic power, still head of the Commonwealth,
still a member of the Group of Seven most powerful economic nations.
What is the point of all this clout, all this influence, if we are not
prepared to be involved in global problems? Britain's arms industry is
worth some 100,000 jobs, which depend on continuous vaunting of the
professionalism of our no-conscript professional forces.
Mr Major's cabinets, and those of Margaret Thatcher before him, have
taken the view that, continuously, Britain must be seen to be taking a
lead. From time to time our initiatives will flounder because the United
States takes a different stance and because it is nigh impossible to get
concerted action from the 15-member European Union.
The Serb waiter's warning must seem merely anecdotal when placed in
this context of British diplomatic strategy. Friday, however, might see
Mr Major's last fling in this field.

WALKING the dog cost a woman her job. However, she has been awarded
#5893 compensation for unfair dismissal and an order for her to be
reinstated.
Miss Anne Stitt, of Heatherlie Terrace, Selkirk, was employed as a
food process worker at Farne Salmon &amp; Trout Ltd in Galashiels from May,
1991, until she was dismissed on October 31 last year for refusing to
work overtime four days earlier.
In sacking the employee, the company followed the advice of its
employment consultants, who claimed her refusal to obey a reasonable
order was gross misconduct and a dismissal case.
The tribunal accepted there was no dispute between both parties that
overtime was compulsory, subject to an employee being excused if he or
she had a valid excuse.
On Thursday, October 27, Miss Stitt was told after the morning tea
break that she would need to work overtime that night.
She told her production manager that she couldn't work as her three
dogs had been at home since 7am and there was no-one to let them out as
her boyfriend was in Glasgow that day.
Miss Stitt did not work the overtime and was called into the office of
Mr Stewart Black, the factory manager, at short notice on October 31 for
a disciplinary hearing and was dismissed for gross misconduct.
The tribunal noted: ''At the disciplinary hearing, Mr Black did not
give appropriate consideration to the applicant's case.
''In the tribunal's view, he was too ready to treat the applicant's
behaviour as misconduct. Indeed, it appeared to the tribunal that he was
unduly influenced by the advice given by the respondent's employment
consultants.''
''The tribunal did not accept that, in the circumstances, dismissal
was within the band of reasonable responses.''

THE announcement yesterday by Labour's Chief Whip, Mr Derek Foster,
that he is to step down in the autumn marks a further stage in the
consolidation of Mr Tony Blair's authority.
Labour MPs will vote today on an important change in the parliamentary
party's standing orders which would end the separate election of the
Chief Whip by MPs.
Instead, he or she will be appointed by the leader from the ranks of
the elected members of the Shadow Cabinet, whose number will be
increased by one to 19.
This will give Mr Blair more scope to ensure that the holder of this
key appointment runs the parliamentary party the way he wants. The Chief
Whip has the second highest salary in the Opposition, #62,096.
Mr Foster,58, MP for Bishop Auckland, is thought by some close to Mr
Blair to have run the party on too light a rein.
Labour MPs who did not want a tougher disciplinarian in the job
enabled him to beat off successive challenges.
If Labour wins the next election, the Chief Whip's job will be crucial
to the party's success, having quickly to instil discipline in a group
likely to contain many new MPs.
As well as being in tune with the party leader, the ideal Chief Whip
also must be willing to frankly voice the party's concerns to him and
offer advice without fear or favour.
Mr Blair's supporters are confident that the rule change will be
carried today. They are cautious about who might be appointed after next
autumn's Shadow Cabinet elections but possibilities include Mr Frank
Dobson, Shadow Environment Secretary; Mrs Ann Taylor, Shadow Commons
Leader, and Mr Ron Davies, Shadow Welsh Secretary.
Mr Foster has been given responsibility for preparing for the
transition from Opposition to Government. He said it was only sensible
that the person who would be Government Chief Whip should have time to
settle into the job in Opposition.
Mr Foster won the post in 1985 in a closely fought contest with three
other candidates in which he was 24 votes behind Mr Norman Hogg, MP for
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, on the first ballot and beat him by only one
vote in the second.
A member of the Salvation Army, he has worn the uniform as a cornetist
and trumpeter. Twice married, he has a daughter and three sons. He once
worked at quilt-making in Edinburgh in the 1960s and became assistant
director of education in Sunderland.
Mr Foster said: ''I have enjoyed every moment of my decade as Chief
Whip and I am proud that I will be leaving for a new senior job at a
time when our strength and performance in Parliament have helped to
reduce the Government to its current parlous state''

A PARLIAMENTARY committee has called for curbs on new genetic drugs
and laboratories offering screening for diseases, writes Nic Outterside.
MPs demanded yesterday that a Human Genetics Commission should be set
up to regulate the industry and advise the Government.
The recommendation followed an inquiry into a branch of research which
has taken the scientific world by storm.
A report published by the Commons Science and Technology Committee
said: ''Public confidence is vital if genetic science is to be used to
its full potential and will best be safeguarded by a robust but flexible
regulatory system.''
The committee fears there is ''a very real danger that unscrupulous
companies may prey on the public's fear of disease and genetic disorders
and offer inappropriate tests, without adequate counselling and even
without the laboratory facilities necessary to ensure the tests are
conducted accurately.''
It says: ''We recommend as a matter of urgency that there should be a
body to regulate companies offering genetic screening through a process
of protocol review and licensing.''
However, it admits that it may take time to establish such a
regulatory body. ''In the interim, the Government should take steps to
regulate such companies.''
Mr John McAllion, Labour's Scottish health spokesman, welcomed the
committee's recommendations.
However, Mrs Margaret Ewing, the Scottish National Party's
parliamentary spokeswoman on health, said that although she shared the
concerns about possible abuses of genetic research, she could not
visualise immediate ways to enact legislation.
In recent years, investigating DNA and genetic research has been the
subject of intense scrutiny in laboratories.
Britain is at the forefront of research and prospects are good for new
medicines to help sufferers of inherited conditions like cystic
fibrosis, sickle- cell anaemia, and some cancers.
In Scotland, genetic studies range from research into improving crops
to finding cures for life-threatening diseases.
Construction started last month on a #250,000 building in Dundee which
will house the first multi-disciplinary research centre in Scotland
focusing on the causes of neurological diseases.
Five teams of researchers will be brought together at the
Neurosciences Research Institute at Ninewells Hospital in a bid to
uncover the secrets of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders,
including genetic defects in the brain.
A Paisley-based project hopes to establish a cell culture that
reproduces itself while keeping its characteristics. The ''immortal''
cell cultures could replace up to 70% of traditional laboratory
experiments on animals.
At the Scottish Crop Research Institute at Invergowrie, a team of
scientists is hoping, by genetic alteration, to develop a new strain of
potato that will not turn brown when it is fried.
However, these are well-accepted scientific trials, funded and
organised on a non-profit making basis.
Yesterday's report says genetic science has enormous potential
benefits for health care and must be supported.
It warns, however, that safeguards are vital as this branch of science
opens up huge ethical and moral issues.
It says that, in the short term, the most widespread use of genetic
knowledge will be in genetic diagnosis and screening where a danger of
uncontrolled use of information could lead to discrimination. The
committee calls for laws to forbid misuse of genetic information.
Problems over health insurance due to testing and increases in
premiums should also be looked at.
The report recommends that no screening for disease should be done
unless it is for an important condition and offers a clear diagnosis and
prognosis, informs choice, and may offer the chance to prevent the
problem arising.
Screening for pregnant mothers is only acceptable if it rests on free
and informed consent.

STAFF in public services are to be trained and encouraged to spot
illegal immigrants under a package of measures unveiled by the Home
Secretary last night.
Mr Michael Howard said the crackdown was aimed at stopping illegal
immigrants from claiming benefits and using public services at a cost of
millions of pounds to the taxpayer.
He said staff providing benefit payments, student grants and services
such as medical treatment will be trained to identify illegal immigrants
and encouraged to inform the immigration authorities about them.
However, the Home Secretary has stopped short of proposing any new
statutory duty on public sector staff to check and inform on immigrant
suspects.
His plans were condemned by the main public sector union Unison, which
claimed it could lead to nurses being asked to provide ''an immigration
service on the cheap''.
Immigration support groups also claimed the measures would add to the
''climate of fear'' felt by many legitimate British citizens from ethnic
minorities who were legally entitled to services and benefits.
Mr Howard said his proposals would ''strengthen immigration controls,
save taxpayers money and greatly reduce the incentive'' for illegal
immigrants to head for the UK.
The Home Secretary said: ''Some claimants enter the country illegally
or break their conditions of entry then milk the system for all they can
get.
''For example, we have identified 87 families claiming child benefit
after they have returned to their own country. This discovery saves the
taxpayer #1.5m. This type of abuse has to stop.''
He added: ''Lawful residents in Britain will not be affected and have
nothing to fear, no matter what their ethnic background.''
Mr Howard said it was ''obviously very difficult'' to put a figure on
the exact cost to the taxpayer at present because the number of illegal
immigrants in the country was not known. The estimates ranged from
20,000 to a million.
However, he told journalists at a briefing in London that 13,000 were
detected last year and it was ''reasonable'' to assume they were
claiming some sort of benefit or service, putting the cost for these
people alone at about #100 million.
The proposals include:
* Tightening controls on access to free NHS treatment by foreigners --
in one case highlighted by Mr Howard an overseas ''visitor'' was
receiving expensive kidney dialysis treatment within days of arriving in
London.
* Giving clearer instructions on spotting illegal immigrants to social
security and employment staff who pay out benefits.
The only new legislation proposed at this stage will take away from
illegal immigrants the right to social housing.
Asked about the proposals for NHS staff, Mr Howard said sometimes
doctors would be able to spot ''signs that will put them on notice and
arouse their suspicions.
''It's when their suspicions are aroused that we expect them to get in
touch with the immigration authorities.''
However, his junior Minister, Ann Widdecombe, said there was no
suggestion that people needing urgent treatment would be turned away
without a valid passport.
The British Medical Association said it would want to look ''very
closely'' at any proposals to involve doctors in catching illegal
immigrants.
Mr Gareth James of the National Association of Head Teachers said
school heads would have ''grave concerns'' about becoming involved in
this area.
Gloria Mills, head of equal opportunities at Unison, said: ''It is a
disgrace that the Government could suggest that social workers or
ambulance staff should provide an immigration service on the cheap.
''We do not believe that any amount of training could possibly equip
health or council staff to act in a fair, effective or appropriate
way.''

ITALY'S Olympic road race champion Fabio Casartelli died today during
the toughest mountain stage in the Pyrenees of the Tour de France.
Casartelli fell on a bend in a multiple crash as riders were going
downhill after the first of the day's six climbs. He was taken
unconscious by helicopter to Tarbes with severe head injuries and died
30 minutes after reaching hospital.
The 24-year-old Italian, who won the Olympic gold medal in Barcelona
in 1992, appeared to hit a concrete bollard on a bend before falling
heavily with blood pouring from head wounds.
He brought a number of other riders down, including Frenchman Dante
Rezze, who fell into a ravine and broke a thigh bone, and German Dirk
Baldinger, who suffered a fractured hip bone.
Casartelli, who was married last year and who recently became a
father, was only the third rider to die in the Tour de France's 92-year
history and the first since Britain's Tommy Simpson in 1967.
Tonight the Motorola team said its riders would continue in the race
in Casartelli's memory. A minute's silence will be observed before the
start of tomorrow's 16th stage in Tarbes.--Reuter.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977322225</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE spectacular crash of Barings merchant bank in February has been
blamed solely on the actions of derivatives trader Nick Leeson, whose
unauthorised dealings ran up losses eventually totalling #830m.
There are also stinging rebukes for the failure of Barings' internal
management controls and the refusal to listen to warnings.
However the Bank of England was given a fairly clean bill of health.
The Board of Banking Supervision says that the events leading up to
the collapse do not of themselves point to the need for any fundamental
change to the framework of regulation in the UK.
At a news conference, Bank of England Governor Eddie George eagerly
seized on the main conclusion that the Barings collapse stemmed from the
unauthorised and ultimately catastrophic activities of, it appears, one
individual (Leeson).
These activities went undetected as a consequence of a failure of
management and other internal controls of a most basic kind.
''Management failed at various levels . . . adequately to follow up a
number of warning signals over a prolonged period. Neither the external
auditors nor the regulators discovered Leeson's unauthorised
activities.''
The board says that it does not believe that the Bank was aware of the
substantial transfer of funds from Barings in London to Singapore which
took place in January and February of this year, and it makes no
criticism of the Bank for not being aware of this.
Instead it argues that Barings reasonably placed reliance upon local
regulators of the overseas operation. It was also entitled to place
reliance on the explanations given by management as to the profitability
of these operations and on other information provided by Barings to the
Bank.
However, while Mr George was quick to deny old boy connections with
the senior Barings management, the vast majority of whom have
subsequently resigned including chairman Peter Baring, the Bank regarded
controls in Barings as informal but effective.
This was typified in that in 1993, the Bank supervisor, Mr Chris
Thompson, permitted Barings to exceed the 25% limit on group shareholder
funds that could be advanced overseas as an ''informal concession''.
Mr Thompson resigned last week as, according to Mr George, he felt his
position untenable and that he did not have the confidence of the people
around him. But that begs the question as to who was supervising Mr
Thompson.
The board also says that there is no evidence that, on the information
available to it, the Bank could have prevented the Barings collapse.
The Bank itself welcomed the report and the 17 recommendations put
forward and accepted that its supervisory regulations needed to be
improved but that there is no need for sweeping changes to the
regulatory framework.
The investigation details how Leeson, now languishing in jail in
Frankfurt ahead of possible extradition to Singapore, was transferred
from London to Barings in March 1992. There he passed the local
examinations and began trading on Simex, the Singapore financial futures
exchange.
The main activities were to take a view on the future movements of the
movements of the Nikkei 225 shares index, the 10 year Japanese
Government Bond futures contract, the three month Euroyen where the
price of each contract depends upon the underlying value of the
constituents.
In July that year the now notorious account 88888 was opened to
conceal unauthorised trading although at the time its use was initially
to handle differences in clients accounts. However Barings allowed the
balance on this account to grow undetected to the extent that it
amounted to #2m by December 1992.
A year later, it had risen to #23m and by June 1994 the accumulated
deficit totalled #116m. Six months later, in December, the loss had
almost doubled to #208m and by February 27 this year, when Barings
collapsed, it had reached #827m. Losses in 1994 alone were #185m but
Barings, unaware of the losses, on February 22 approved accounts,
subject to final audit, of pre-tax-profits of #102m after charging #102m
to the group bonus pool.

THE misery and humiliation of the UN mission in Bosnia deepened today
as peacekeepers once again were turned into helpless hostages inside
what were supposed to be UN safe areas.
Shells rained down on the stricken eastern enclave of Zepa as rebel
Serbs tried to batter the mountainous town into surrender -- something
even the Nazis failed to do.
Serb troops who fought to within a mile of the town were reported to
have made further advances over the rugged terrain.
The defenders took desperate action.
UN spokesman Rida Ettarashany said: ''Bosnian Government troops are
surrounding the main base of the Ukrainian company and are threatening
to use them as human shields unless there are Nato air strikes on the
Serbs.''
In a twist which left the Ukrainians in a hopeless, no-win situation
the Serbs in turn renewed threats to shoot eight of the peacekeepers in
a base under their control if Nato planes are called in.
The Ukrainians tonight had had enough. A top official in the capital
Kiev urged the United Nations to withdraw his country's soldiers
immediately and warned that a ''huge tragedy'' could occur.
But the United Nations, its forces already overstretched on the
ground, had no immediate plans either to evacuate the Ukrainians or to
send in reinforcements, a spokeswoman said.
Bosnian soldiers who survived last week's Serb onslaught on the ''safe
area'' of Srebrenica continued to arrive at the central Bosnian town of
Tuzla today. So far more than 4000 have made it to safety. But there was
growing gloom about the fate of a further 11,000 men. As if to
underscore their triumph, the Serbs tonight shelled Tuzla, killing a man
and wounding eight others.
In Gorazde, where Bosnian Government troops surround another Ukrainian
compound, they dragged the Ukrainian commander over a fence, roughed him
up, and held a gun to his head before confiscating personal weapons,
anti-tank rockets, and an estimated nine armoured vehicles.
''Such behaviour can only be described as outrageous, inexcusable, and
of no benefit to the cause of the Bosnian Government,'' said UN
spokesman Alexander Ivanko.
In Washington Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that
officials have been discussing stepped up action in Bosnia, including
''the possibility of a more aggressive air campaign.''
His comments came after a high-level White House meeting of Clinton
advisers.
Christopher said Clinton would talk to Prime Minister John Major and
French President Jacques Chirac in the next 24 hours in an effort to
develop a plan of action.
Whatever is decided, if anything, the United States will insist on
maximum flexibility for American forces, including the end of UN
controls on calling air strikes, officials said.
''There is unanimity in this Government that if our guys are going to
get involved we're going to do it our way, meaning the right way. You
give your guys as much protection as you can give them,'' he said.
The Americans were determined ''that if our guys go in they must not
be encumbered by these frankly unworkable rules that have contributed to
the problems that the UN has had'', especially the dual key arrangement
that gave the UN a veto over any Nato military action.--AP/Reuter.

AN MP yesterday demanded an urgent inquiry into an outbreak of
suicides among psychiatric patients at Royal Edinburgh Hospital.
Four patients have killed themselves within eight weeks and Mr Nigel
Griffiths, MP for Edinburgh South, wants to know if the deaths are
connected with conditions at the hospital.
''When I visited the hospital earlier this year, I was appalled --
there were four to eight people in a dorm with no privacy, lino on the
floors, and the enforced closure of wards to save money.
''People who had been discharged into the community were coming back
in a worse state.''
He said Edinburgh Healthcare Trust, which runs the hospital, had been
doing its best to secure more funding from Lothian Health Board, but was
clearly not getting enough.
''I do not know if the suicides are connected with these conditions
but I am pressing the Secretary of State to hold an independent
inquiry,'' he said.
Dr John Loudon, head of mental health services at the trust, said the
cluster of suicides was relatively unusual but added: ''They were all
seriously ill people who had been ill for a number of years and had
previously had suicidal feelings. They were all being nursed intensively
in accordance with the protocols appropriate to their condition.''
Dr Loudon said the hospital had gone through a period of severe
over-occupancy, amounting to as much as 120% (which means patients
having to be sent elsewhere) but discharges into the community had
enabled them to reduce overcrowding by the time the suicides took place.
Occupancy was 100-102%.
''Nursing input to the wards is the highest ever in historic terms,''
he added. ''We are naturally extremely concerned that this has happened
and are inquiring into it. We have found no evidence that the deaths
were due to any deficiency in their care.
''The deaths have been reported to the Mental Welfare Commission and
the procurator-fiscal, who can carry out further inquiries if they see
fit, but they have not done so yet.''
A spokesman for Lothian Health Board said last night: ''We have
confirmed with Edinburgh Healthcare Trust that each of these deaths has
been routinely reviewed and accept their view that the only factor
involved was a serious psychiatric illness of these individuals.''

STRICTER rules governing the behaviour of Ministers and civil servants
were announced by the Government yesterday, in advance of a potentially
explosive debate today on the Nolan inquiry into standards in public
life.
A new Civil Service Code and tougher guidelines for former Ministers
who accept lucrative posts in the private sector are among measures
designed to reinforce the public's confidence in a Government hit by a
succession of damaging ''sleaze'' allegations.
The new Public Services Minister, Mr Roger Freeman, told MPs the
Government has accepted most of the Nolan recommendations affecting the
conduct of Government. ''The Prime Minister has made it clear that he is
determined to uphold the highest standards in public life,'' he said.
However, he left to MPs themselves the contentious question of outside
earnings, on which Lord Nolan and his Government-appointed committee
recommended strong action.
Labour gave the Government's response to the Nolan report a qualified
welcome.
However, Shadow Leader of the House Ann Taylor warned more was needed
to counter the impression of an ''elected dictatorship'' abusing the
public trust, and called on the Government to allow the Nolan committee
to examine the funding of political parties.
Labour also challenged the Government over amendments to its
guidelines for Ministers, which have been qualified to say Ministers
must not ''knowingly'' mislead Parliament.
Existing guidance states Ministers must not mislead Parliament and
must be as open as possible with Parliament and the public.
Under the new code, Ministers are told to be as open as possible --
''withholding information only when disclosure would not be in the
public interest''.
Mrs Taylor said sometimes Ministers ''choose not to know'', but Mr
Freeman rejected as ''utterly wrong'' what he described as a ''slur'' on
those in public life.
Ministers occasionally were not fully aware of the facts when
addressing the House, he said.
Of what was 'not in the public interest', he said there had been
consultation for over six months on the reasons why ''sometimes it
necessary not to disclose certain facts because it would be against the
public interest''.
Such categories as defence, security, and international relations were
''well established and entirely defensible'', he said.
0 The principal reforms proposed by the Government, based on the Nolan
recommendations, include:
* Ministers will henceforth come under the remit of the Committee on
Business Appointments. The Government will draw up new criteria for the
committee to define when a former Minister should delay taking up a
private sector job. The rules will be debated by the Commons in the
autumn before being put into force.
* The Government endorses the Nolan Committee's recommendation that
Ministers should not accept hospitality that would or might appear to
place them under an obligation. There should be no distinction between a
Minister's conduct as a Minister and his conduct as an MP.
* A new Commissioner for Public Appointments will be appointed to
monitor and offer guidance on quango appointments.
* The use of advisory bodies, ''including an independent element'',
will be extended to cover appointments to executive public bodies and
the NHS.

SCOTTISH babies could become involved in new genetic research by an
experimental institute run by directors of British Nuclear Fuels.
The Labour Party has condemned the so-called independent DNA bank at a
scientific site close to the Sellafield nuclear plant, which is funded
by BNFL and backed by an English university linked to applications to
conduct experiments on dead children without their parents' consent.
An institute spokesman said fears of vested interest were groundless
and any DNA experiments would be carried out independently of BNFL.
The disclosures come soon after a public outcry over revelations that
more than 2000 dead Scots babies and 126 pregnant mothers were involved
in secret nuclear experiments in the early 1960s.
The experiments were conducted by the UK Atomic Energy Authority in a
bid to find out if fallout from atomic bomb tests had affected the
youngsters.
MPs fear that that scenario could be recreated by studies at the
Westlakes Research Institute, five miles from Sellafield.
The institute was formed with BNFL funding on the back of widespread
concerns that the incidence of childhood leukemia in the village of
Seascale, a mile-and-a-half from Sellafield, was 10 times the national
average.
Despite proclamations of independence, records at Companies House
reveal that 11 BNFL personnel form the board of Westlakes Research
Trading Ltd, while five BNFL employees run the research institute.
It is widely believed that BNFL's own genetics group will also become
part of the DNA research establishment, which it will help fund with #1m
over six years.
The institute proposes to collect, store, and analyse samples of
genetic material and blood from 8000 babies born in Cumbria over the
next five years at Westlakes and the Department of Child Health at
Newcastle University.
It plans to use DNA samples to investigate evidence of genetic
diseases, genetic damage related to radiation exposure, and possible
radiation-linked diseases such as childhood leukemia.
A recent BNFL newsletter stated: ''While it could also help research
into the effects of radiation, BNFL believes the study will prove there
is no difference between the genetic make-up of children born to
Sellafield fathers and those from the rest of the region.''
The environmental group Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment
(Core) is fighting the nuclear company's interest in the research and
expresses concern about the so-called impartial involvement of Newcastle
University child health department.
According to confidential letters handed to The Herald, Dr Alan Craft,
a Newcastle consultant paediatrician who works closely with the
department, applied for permission in 1984 to dissect and experiment on
placentas and organs from dead children for a nuclear industry-backed
study of ''radionuclides in tissues from children'' without consulting
or reporting back to the deceased's parents.
The proposals received ethical criticism from West Cumbria Health
Authority which also warned of public concern over ''the BNFL
connection''. But Dr Craft's scheme helped provide impetus for the
Westlakes initiative.
Core has welcomed genetic research to establish the causes of leukemia
in children but questions the impartiality of BNFL and Newcastle
University.
''We feel that this particular project, to be sited at a BNFL
laboratory with research carried out by BNFL scientists and funded by
BNFL money, sets a dangerous precedent for the future,'' said a
spokesman.
''Some parents involved in the Sellafield High Court leukemia cases,
who believe radioactive contamination caused leukemia in their children,
said that research carried out jointly by Westlakes and Newcastle
University on behalf of BNFL had been used in evidence against them in
the High Court.
''It is not surprising that the 'independent' label attributed to
Westlakes is called into question.''
Dr David King, editor of GenEthics News, an independent newsletter on
ethical issues, said it was ''not desirable'' that a DNA bank should be
run by a private organisation not directly accountable to the public or
to those who have made donations.
He also expressed concern about the system of coding and
confidentiality of the DNA samples. He cited possible abuses that could
result in an individual with chromosonal abnormalities being denied
employment at nuclear installations or experience genetic discrimination
with insurance companies.
Although the Westlakes institute plans to experiment on DNA from
Cumbrian-born babies, it is also proposed to take samples from Carlisle
hospitals, which care for Scottish mothers, and to extend the project to
an international scale.
MP John McAllion, Labour's Scottish health spokesman, said he was
extremely concerned about BNFL's involvement in the DNA studies.
''It appears obvious that with their control over the study they will
be able to release scientific reports into aspects of radiation under
the guise of 'independence','' he said.
Mr Alex Smith, South of Scotland Euro-MP, said he found the
involvement of BNFL in the DNA experiments ''disgraceful'' and called
for an inquiry into any pecuniary interest and complete transparency in
all genetic research.
''It worries me greatly about what use the results from these
experiments may be put to,'' he said.
However, a spokesman for Westlakes told The Herald that only the
medical and child health departments at Newcastle University would have
access to the DNA sample details and these would be kept at ''arms
length'' from BNFL.
He said the institute had received ethical approval -- including that
of West Cumbria Health Authority ethics committee -- to begin its
research and had started anonymous trials to test ''statistical and
technical correctness''. The full programme, which will last for at
least 20 years, should be in operation by the end of this year.
''We are aware of public concerns and therefore aim to demonstrate
independence from BNFL who have a general interest, but are only
involved as funders,'' he added.

SIX hundred pounds may sound bags of money for one smart leather
pochette, but that's the lower end of the range. At the top is the
alligator number costing upwards of #5000. Judith Leiber is the designer
of these pricey accessories. Her customers covet, clutch and cherish
them. Outlets in the UK include Harvey Nichols, the favourite store of
Absolutely Fabulous's Patsy and Edina.
Who would pay hundreds or thousands for a handbag? Joan Collins, Nancy
Reagan and Joan Rivers to name but a few, have all been photographed
with their Leiber bags. Some of the dear ladies were given the bags as
presents. This was a shrewd marketing ploy on the part of Leiber, a bit
of high-profile product placement.
The quality of Leiber bags is not disputed. Frames are manufactured in
Italy and Spain, the linings are sumptuous and beautifully finished.
Materials are the finest, and attention to detail is meticulous.
Manufacture by hand is supervised by Judith Leiber, herself an artisan
trained in her native Hungary in the early 1940s. She has been in
business in New York since 1963.
The simple thirties-style clutch bags with art deco clasps and
semi-precious stones deserve their place in museums and collections. But
it is perhaps for her rhinestone-encrusted egg-shaped evening bags that
Judith Leiber is best known.
These are carried at glitzy events by film stars and princesses. In
the USA socialites and women ''active in the volunteer world'' use
Leiber bags which represent the extremes of elegance and kitsch. Classic
chic comes in the form of a long black suede envelope with collapsible
handle and geometric clasp.
There are no designer initials or logos and the inspiration,
materials, shapes and colours are diverse, but still the glitterati at
opera or Oscars know a Leiber bag when they see one.
But is it art? It might well be with some of the most sophisticated
designs taking the form of abstract paintings, interpreted in leather.
Leiber minaudieres are small metal boxes or evening bags whose design
developed from cigarette boxes. Some are beautiful, such as the little
fans with chord and tassles. Others have a drop in chain to convert to a
bag. In The Artful Handbag, the book of Leiber bags, minaudieres is
defined as ''a display of affection''. Some mistake surely? Collins
Robert dictionary translates it as ''affected''.
Another discrepancy arose when Colin McDowell wrote in a Sunday paper
that ''The Leiber bag is vulgarity rampant -- as if a Faberge egg had
been designed by Walt Disney under the guidance of Chris Evans.'' The
Artful Handbag calls Leiber's wares ''The epitome of sophistication and
glamour''. They are both right, depending on which bag is being
described. As to The Artful Handbag, loved the pictures, relished the
gossip, shame about some of the verbal minauderie.
The Artful Handbag, Thames and Hudson: #25.

Francesca Fearon discovers a young milliner's love of sculpture has
given her a flamboyant edge
JO GORDON admits she is not entirely a hat wearer herself, but she
adores making flamboyant, flirtatious millinery that she says ''focuses
on the most expressive part of the body -- the face''. Jo Gordon's hats
made a startling debut on the catwalk at the Royal College of Art's
recent post-graduate show. Feathered quills jutting forth like a beak
from a hood, waisted toppers with a cloud of tulle veiling, and a ruler
balancing a quill and an egg, which Gordon called ''the thermometer of
love'', informs her style.
The collection was about seductiveness, with the clouds of red tulle
labelled ''blushing hats'' and the oscillating feathers inside a bird
cage contraption suggesting entrapment and panic -- the caged beauty.
It all sounds like madness, but Gordon's ideas have the ability to
amuse. This 27-year-old Scottish sculptor-turned-milliner is inspired by
the word. So the phrase ''black angel, heavenly paradise'' from Edith
Sitwell became a black twisted wing of straw, while the source of the
quilled beak creation was ''the kiss of death''. This gives the
affectionate peck on the cheek at social occasions a whole new meaning.
Such dizzy prose goes hand-in-hand with the grand pretensions of
serious millinery. However, Jo Gordon is equally adept at making simple,
easy hats that don't arouse self-consciousness from the infrequent
wearer. Last year she won the Kangol hat competition, judged by milliner
Graham Smith, which resulted in her crisp, understated straw hats going
into mass production and selling (plentifully) in Harrods.
''Some hats are quite subtle, not all are crying out for attention,''
Gordon says. She has also designed hats for Debenhams' swimwear
collection.
Like her predecessor at the RCA, Philip Treacy whose uncompromising
creations have stormed the international design world, Gordon's own bold
concepts have prompted an enthusiastic response.
She is now working on projects with Gaultier, Hussein Chalayn, and
Ghost. The more theatrical aspect of her craft has found an outlet in
work for theatre and television. She created hats last year for D'Oyly
Carte productions of Die Fleidermaus and HMS Pinafore, and Channel 4's
Viva Cabaret.
The boldness and drama of her serious millinery shows its roots in
sculpture. The German sculptor Rebecca Horn is a major influence, but
Gordon is also an accomplished sculptor, having trained at Gray's School
of Art and Design in Aberdeen, where she produced conceptual pieces with
raw textiles. A spell at teaching art and design at Ankara University in
Turkey uncovered fabulous oriental fabrics which she had made into
clothes by a local tailor while she made matching hats.
On her return to Scotland she began making hats -- colourful crochet
beanies -- scarves and waistcoats professionally, which she sold to
Liberty, The Hat Shop, and The Warehouse (now The Gallery) in Glasgow.
It was her fondness for graphic three-dimensional design which persuaded
her that millinery would be her future.
The growing British passion for hats, reflected in mini collections
being launched by The Gap and Marks &amp; Spencer, suggests millinery is a
vocation worthy of pursuit. But who does Jo Gordon see wearing her hats?
''Someone who is quite seductive and flirtatious in a quiet sort of
way.''

A YOUTH was cleared yesterday of raping a 15-year-old girl in a public
park.
A jury at the High Court in Inverness returned a unanimous not guilty
verdict on Mr Mark Cow, 18, who denied raping the girl at Cooper Park,
Elgin, on August 27 last year.
The court heard evidence that the girl walked hand-in-hand with Mr Cow
as they left the scene of the alleged attack. The girl, now 16, had
claimed that Mr Cow ordered her to lie down on grass behind bushes
before he allegedly forced her to have sex with him.
Both defence counsel Mhairi Richards and Advocate-depute William
Totten pointed to a shortage of corroborating evidence.
Mr Cow, of March Court, Llanbryde, Moray, admitted having sex with the
girl, but maintained she had consented.

THE Dean of Lincoln yesterday steadfastly denied that he had a sexual
relationship with a former cathedral verger.
In more than three hours in the witness box at a consistory court
hearing, the Very Rev Brandon Jackson, 60, insisted he was not intimate
with Verity Freestone, 32, on two occasions in late 1993, as she claims.
He described Miss Freestone as ''insecure'' and ''unstable'' and
admitted he had made ''an enormous mistake of judgment'' in seeing her
on his own at the deanery after he had previously been ''deceived'' into
seeing her alone at her home.
However, he added: ''She was fragile, she needed help, I'm caring for
her, I still feel sorry for her, whatever's happened, and I wanted to
help her in the best way I can.''
Miss Freestone claimed in the witness box on Monday that the dean
tried unsuccessfully to have sexual intercourse with her at her home in
Croft Street, Lincoln, on October 19, 1993, and again at the Deanery on
November 30, bringing her to orgasm with oral sex each time instead.
The dean yesterday denied there was any sexual impropriety.
He accepted that he went to her home on the first occasion and she
came to the deanery on the second.
On the first occasion, he was going for a run, as he was training for
the London Marathon, and rang her at 9.30pm to say he would not be able
to see her as she had requested after all.
She said her sister was there but, when he ran to the house, he
realised she was not.
He accepted under cross-examination by David Stokes QC that ''with
hindsight'' it would have been better to leave but he stayed for 30 to
40 minutes to listen to her problems to try to dissuade her from
returning as a voluntary verger to the cathedral where she had worked
for three months that year.
He agreed with Mr Stokes that ''to a certain extent'' he felt
''deceived'' into being alone with her.
On the second occasion, he had told her not to come round, as his wife
was away, but she arrived at the deanery at 10pm and ''burst in'',
saying: ''For God's sake, give us a coffee.''
He said he made her coffee and then called a taxi for her.
He said: ''I can see that I've made an enormous mistake of judgment,
otherwise we wouldn't be here today.''
After that, he suggested to her that she should seek counselling
elsewhere.
''I began to feel that her insistence on coming to me was embarrassing
me and was in danger of compromising me, and I felt it better to draw
stumps.''
He was ''very, very surprised'' and ''stunned'' when he heard her
allegations.
He denied ever making flirtatious remarks to her in the months before
the alleged affair, saying: ''Verity Freestone is an insecure, unstable
girl, who needs pastoral care and sympathetic understanding. A
flirtatious remark towards her would be very unwise and very unkind.''
A succession of witnesses spoke of the dean being ''tactile'' and
flattering but not one to overstep the mark.
Mrs Lynn Thomason-Knowles, a tourism consultant for the cathedral,
said she had suffered three tragedies, and the dean had counselled her.
''It would be usual for him to put an arm around me to comfort me. It
would also be usual for him to do that to my husband.''
He had been known to drop in when out running, perhaps as late as
10pm, and sometimes when she was on her own.
''All of his comments to me have been in a fatherly way,'' she said.
Mrs Hazel Belcher, a member of the congregation, said: ''The dean to
me is the epitome of what a real Christian is.''
The second day of the hearing began with a trip to the deanery for the
four assessors considering the case, Judge Richard Hamilton, and counsel
to examine the layout of the building.
The defence has suggested that Miss Freestone may have been able to
describe the bedroom by looking in before or after using the toilet at
Bible study classes, which she has denied.
The dean faces two charges of ''conduct unbecoming'' and could be
dismissed from his post if found guilty and later defrocked if any
appeal failed.
The hearing continues.

NEW Perth and Kinross MP Roseanna Cunningham is tostand for the post
of vice-convener of policy at the Scottish National Party's annual
conference in Perth in September.
Her decision to challenge the incumbent, Mr Alex Neil -- confirmed
yesterday in the publication of the SNP's nominations for national
office-bearers and elected members of its national executive committee
-- has raised concerns among several senior party members, it was
claimed last night.
One senior party source, who declined to be named, said that Ms
Cunningham should concentrate on retaining her seat at the next General
Election and leave the development and promotion of strategy to Mr Neil,
who was ''an extremely well liked and well respected'' party member.
The only other surprise among the nominations was that of Mr Calum
Cashley, a 28-year-old taxi driver and party activist from Dundee, who
is to challenge Euro-MP Winnie Ewing for the presidency of the SNP.
The nomination of Mr Cashley, who is understood to have stood twice
unsuccessfully in local government elections, was dismissed as being
''unrealistic'' by party sources.
However, Mr Cashley said last night: ''For years, the SNP has probably
been the most democratic of all the parliamentary parties. But recently
we have seen leading figures making up policy, such as the 'Indepence in
Europe' slogan, on the hoof, which is not acceptable.
''By making this challenge we can start a real debate about where the
party is going.''
Mr Cashley added: ''My challenge is entirely serious. The people who
are saying I will get little support are not doing the same homework as
I am.''
Ms Cunningham gained the seat for the SNP at the Perth and Kinross
by-election in May. The vice-convener of policy role is one of some
importance, given the responsibility of developing the party's policy in
the run-up to the next General Election and before that, its policy
ahead of next year's inter-governmental conference.
Ms Cunningham said yesterday that the experience of having to focus
very strongly on the issue of policy and development on a day-to-day
basis during the by-election had convinced her to stand for the post.
''As a result of that, there were certain areas I wanted to be
involved in driving forward in a more focused way,'' she said.
''One of those was the whole issue of the concept of being a citizen
in Scotland. We need to take on and develop the whole idea of civic
nationalism.''
The senior party source who declined to be named said: ''Roseanna's
decision to stand for the vice-convener of policy post has raised
several eyebrows among the party's hierarchy. Most of them believe there
is no-one better equipped to develop and promote a strategy to take on
the real Labour in Scotland than Alex Neil.''
Mr Neil, an economist and founder member of the Scottish Labour Party
joined the SNP in the early 1980s. He was not available for comment last
night.
It will be the first time that Mrs Ewing, who this week celebrated 20
years as a member of the European Parliament, has been opposed as SNP
president since she took up the post in 1987.
Mr Stewart Ewing, her husband and agent, said yesterday that he had no
doubts she would be returned as president with a ''thumping majority.''
Party leader Alex Salmond and deputy leader Dr Allan Macartney will be
unopposed at the annual conference -- being held from September 20-23.
Mr Salmond said: ''These nominations are an encouraging sign for the
SNP. While many of the top positions are not being contested, there is a
healthy competition for executive posts, and that is as it should be.''.

THE Commons last night backed plans to provide extra cash help for
fishermen decommissioning their vessels. MPs approved orders without a
vote increasing funding for the scheme and introducing grants for
fishermen needing to improve the safety of their boats.  Scottish
National Party leader Alex Salmond called for a ''scrap and build''
policy for fishing boats. He said: ''We have one of the older fleets in
the whole of the EU. That has implications for safety in fishing as well
as implications for the success for our industry compared with others.''

A 49-YEAR-OLD Dutchman appeared in court yesterday charged with
causing the death of three people by dangerous driving on the A77
Stranraer-Glasgow road at Innermessan, Dumfriesshire, on Monday.
Adrianus van de Wetering, of Sint-Michielgestel, Holland, made no plea
or declaration to the charge, which arose from a collision near the
junction with the A751 Inchparks-Innermessan Road, near Stranraer.
Mr Van de Wetering was allowed bail on condition that he surrendered
his passport and documents with surety of #350, and that he remained in
the Stranraer and Wigtown area until his expected appearance in court
next week. The case was continued for further investigation.
The three people who died in the crash involving a coach and two cars
were named yesterday by police as Ms Dawn Barrett, 25, the driver of a
Ford Fiesta, her father John Barrett, 61, and her boyfriend, Andrew
Smith, 29. Ms Barrett's mother, Yvonne, 53, was last night said to be in
a serious condition in Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. The four
were from Darfield, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire.
They were understood to have set off on a week-long holiday hours
before the accident, and were heading for the Stranraer ferry on their
way to visit the family's eldest son John, who is serving in the Army in
Northern Ireland.
The driver and two passengers in a Volkswagen Passat involved in the
crash suffered only minor injuries.
The coach driver and his 35 passengers also escaped injury.

GOLF legend Gary Player -- who will play in his 41st consecutive Open
Championship this week -- received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree
from St Andrews University at a special graduation ceremony yesterday.
The South African golfer -- a three-times Open champion -- held up his
degree after the ceremony as proudly as any of the 150-plus titles he
has won over his illustrious career.
Mr Player -- the so-called Black Knight -- followed in the footsteps
of Jack Nicklaus, who received an honorary degree in 1984.
The 59-year-old, who took part in his first Open Championship at St
Andrews 41 years ago, shook hands with a young fan before he took to the
stage to receive his honour from chancellor Sir Kenneth Dover in the

FOREIGN Secretary Malcom Rifkind today leads a concerted effort by
Britain and France to get United States agreement to a more ''muscular''
attitude to the Bosnian Serbs who now threaten a complete collapse of
the United Nations ''safe havens''.
Without American approval, complete withdrawal of UN forces is
imminent.
Briefed by a three-hour Cabinet committee meeting last night, Mr
Rifkind's task is to persuade Washington that the French and the
British, who have most troops at peril, will pull out if the Americans
do not agree to an eleventh-hour stern new initiative to be presented to
the Serbs.
The Americans are prepared to consider this provided that they can
destroy all the Sam missile sites throughout Serbia before they commit
their helicopters and other war planes to action.
President Clinton and the US Congress are also determined that any
military action must be Nato-led rather than controlled by the United
Nations. This could apply as much to more assertive peace keeping action
as to covering the withdrawal of the UN Force.
Yesterday in the Commons the Prime Minister announced that there will
be a special debate tonight in order that MPs on all sides can express
their views without a serious vote as the Bosnian crisis intensifies.
Tomorrow the Cabinet will look again at its secret plans for rescuing
or reinforcing the 200-strong garrison of Royal Welch Fusiliers and 100
Ukrainians in Gorazde. This so called ''safe haven'' is being threatened
by up to 15,000 Bosnian Serbs who last week overran Srebrenica.
Mr Major is aware that if British soldiers are humiliated in Gorazde
his government faces severe political recrimination.
Yesterday in the Commons he spelt out the stark nature of the dilemma
facing all the nations involved in trying to rescue Bosnia from
''catastrophe''.
The options are to build up sufficient military might to go to war --
and there is no sign at all, he said, that there is any will to do this.
The second option is the one he prefers: to carry on with the lifesaving
work done by the UN Force until it becomes impossibly dangerous to do
so.
The third option is complete withdrawal leaving the field open to
fanatics on all sides in former Yugoslavia to continue the atrocities.
He acknowledged that the international peace keeping effort is
becoming ''more dangerous and more hazardous as day succeeds day''. Many
MPs were left the impression that he is preparing the Commons for a
withdrawal at a time when the British troops on the ground there are
approaching 9000. But Mr Major said that withdrawal would have
catastrophic consequences.
''It is possible that events are going to head in the direction of a
UN withdrawal and a lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo. I do believe
that that, were it to happen, would be a course that we would regret and
a course the Bosnians would come to regret as well. There are no magic
answers. What is clear is that it is not practical to mix war fighting
with peace keeping and we need to be entirely clear about that.''
That is the message Mr Rifkind will carry to Washington today. Last
week the British and French were at odds over belligerent rhetoric of
the new French President Chirac. But British Ministers are now
acknowledging that Chirac's impatient and irritated intervention has
caused the Americans to sit up and think again.
France and Britain appear to be allies again not only on the ground in
Bosnia but in the diplomatic offensive which will reach its culmination
in London on Friday at a special conference summoned by Mr Major of all
the nations involved in the UN action.
The Cabinet is united now in the belief that a firm strategy must be
adopted by the weekend and carried through by all those involved,
principally the United States and Russia. American air power is going to
be needed in any event and they are insisting that United Nations
Security Council resolutions already empower Nato to take whatever
military action necessary to enforce the safe havens of Eastern Bosnia
and the delivery of humanitarian aid.
There is British and French sympathy for the American view that their
pilots should not be put at risk by ground-to-air missiles in any action
that ensues either to enforce the save havens or to cover a withdrawal.
But there is resistance within the United Nations and in other countries
to the idea that Sam missile sites deep in Serbia proper should be put
out of action.
President Clinton is constrained by strong opposition in Congress to
any extended involvement in the Bosnian war. His chief military adviser,
General John Shalikashvili, said on Sunday that providing helicopters to
escort a French contingent into Goradze would require such a large
American operation, with attack gun ships (Apaches) and other components
of an air defence system, that it would amount to taking sides in the
conflict and would therefore require Congressional approval.
This is just the sort of excuse the President needs to do nothing.
Congress, if asked, will refuse its approval. Senator Bob Dole, the
Republican leader, intends to bring up in the Senate a resolution
calling for the withdrawal of UNPROFOR and the lifting of the arms
embargo. He may do so this week, and could probably get it through
Congress without difficulty.
The administration opposes this suggestion without offering anything
very concrete as an alternative.
Yesterday Mr Winston Churchill, a member of the Commons Defence Select
Committee, voiced the opinion of a growing number of his fellow Tory
back benchers when he told the Prime Minister: ''The honour of Britain
is engaged over the safe haven of Gorazde with 200 of the Royal Welch
Fusiliers with the Government having established this as a safe haven.
''It is now incumbent upon us to ensure the safety of those tens of
thousands of the civilian population who have flocked there.'' He
demanded: ''Will you make sure, with our allies, together with the
United States, that we do all in our power to ensure that Gorazde does
not fall?''
The Prime Minister replied: ''I am conscious of that but I think you
would be the first to realise that it would not be appropriate for me to
expand on that point.''
His Cabinet, when it meets tomorrow, is fully aware of the domestic
political significance of Mr Churchill's comments yesterday. Contingency
plans have been drawn up by defence chiefs over several weeks to handle
the Gorazde situation, but Ministers want to pore over them again to
convince themselves that the contingency plans will work.
At Monday night's prolonged Cabinet committee meeting, briefed by
Chief of the Defence Staff Sir Peter Inge, a lot of ground was cleared,
it is said. But final decisions -- either for reinforcement or
withdrawal from Gorazde -- cannot be made until Mr Rifkind has returned
from Washington and the Prime Minister has spoken to President Clinton
again on their hotline phone.
Yesterday Mr Major had briefed Labour Leader Tony Blair privately who
went on to ask a question in the Commons of which the Prime Minister had
been notified. The by-partisan policy was maintained by Mr Blair who
hopes that the Bosnian Serbs will take note of Britain's attempt to
resolve the increasingly dangerous situation.
Mr Blair called on the Prime Minister to ''pursue all practical means
to uphold the UN mandate and prevent further ethnic cleansing of the
remaining safe areas. We must impress on our American colleagues the
absolute necessity not just of rhetoric but practical support for our
actions. Threat after threat has been made to the Bosnian Serbs and not
been carried out. Over the next few days, we must work out our bottom
line and this time stick to it -- otherwise the consequences for the UN
and the resolutional conflicts everywhere will be lasting and
disastrous.''

BUYERS from the Japanese industrial conglomerate Kawasaki yesterday
began a multi-million pound ''buy British'' trade mission which could
double its imports to #80m.
Kawasaki representatives will scour the country for electrical
equipment, steel, construction machinery, railway rolling stock, and
aerospace components and consider entering into more joint ventures.
Any deals struck could be worth millions of pounds for a range of
British firms, including Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace, GEC Alsthom,
and British Steel.
The trade visit was described by the President of the Board of Trade,
Mr Ian Lang, as ''the biggest ever shopping expedition'' to Britain by a
Japanese firm.
Kawasaki, which builds ships, trains, helicopters, power stations, and
motor cycles, admits the move has been prompted by the stronger yen,
which has caused it and many other Japanese firms to look overseas for
industrial components.
Addressing a three-day conference to launch the buying week, Mr Lang
stressed that UK exports to Japan had already risen by 35% in the first
half of this year on top of #3bn of exports to Japan last year.
Japan was now by far our biggest market in the Asia Pacific region and
our largest market outside the European Union and the US.
Kawasaki was already demonstrating its commitment to the UK through
investment and partnerships. However, partnership did not just mean
building factories or joint development of products, said Mr Lang.
British companies were alreday selling #40m worth of equipment to
Kawasaki each year and he was confident that ''we should be able to
double that figure, at least, as a result of this single initiative''.

A FORMER gym teacher, who became rich through drug dealing, had two
properties in Glasgow, a house in Spain, was the former tenant of a
public house, owned a fleet of taxis with his wife, and had savings and
a portfolio of stocks and shares, a court heard yesterday.
Geoffrey Meiklejohn, 44, was jailed for six years at the High Court in
Glasgow when he admitted possessing 200 Temazepam capsules and half a
kilo of cannabis.
The court heard that police, acting on a tip-off, seized the capsules
and cannabis, enough to make 2500 joints, from Meiklejohn, a father of
two. They also discovered a sawn-off shotgun, scales for weighing drugs,
and #56,000 in cash.
The Crown has applied for forfeiture of all Meiklejohn's assets
derived from drug dealing. There is no indication of the total value.
Meiklejohn, of Drumchapel Road, Glasgow, has been given six weeks to
prepare his answers and a hearing has been fixed for September 19 in
Glasgow.
Defence counsel Thomas Welsh admitted that Meiklejohn was a ''man of
some substance'' but denied he had amassed his wealth by drug
trafficking.
Mr Welsh said most of the money had been syphoned off from a public
house business of which Meiklejohn was a former tenant.
He claimed the shotgun had been given to him by an employee for
protection after he had been threatened and his pub vandalised.
Mr Welsh claimed it happened after Meiklejohn began to have an affair
with a young woman.
One incident left him in fear of his life and he was so
psychologically traumatised that he began drinking heavily. He had taken
to cannabis to help wean him off alcohol.
Mr Welsh said the 200 Temazepam tablets were also for his personal use
to help him relax during sex with his girlfriend.

AN Australian is today braving chilling temperatures in a bid to swim
the length of Loch Ness.
Mr Daniel Costa wants to prove that it is possible to beat ME. He is
planning to complete the 23-mile swim in 20 hours.
He was setting off from Fort Augustus, at the south-west end of the
loch, at 4am.
Mr Costa suffered from ME for six years and was unable to get out of
bed for up to two months at a time.
However, thanks to a special diet and exercise regime, he says he is
super-fit and ready to tackle the loch.
A boat from sponsors Caley Cruisers, of Inverness, will follow him all
the way to Lochend, with crew passing him food pastes every hour.
Mr Costa joked yesterday: ''It is going to be very cold and tiring in
there, so if Nessie wants to pop up and tow me along for some of the
distance then I will be very grateful.''

INVERNESS gardeners have been angered by the growing problem of deer
damage.
The culprits are native roe deer and sika deer -- originally a
Japanese forest-dwelling species -- which were introduced into the
Highlands several years ago.
A population explosion of sika deer -- which have brown coats with
white spots and flags in the summer months -- has seen them move from
woodland habitats to encroach on Inverness itself.
The animals tear up plants and strip bark from trees. Regional and
district councils are not empowered to shoot them and the Red Deer
Commission says current legislation does not allow householders to kill
them.
Commission spokesman Dick Youngson said: ''The animals are not covered
by any legislation which allows them to be shot.
''The 1959 Deer (Scotland) Act, which was amended in 1982, only allows
farmers, foresters, and market gardeners to shoot deer -- not residents
of housing estates whose gardens are under attack.''
Mr Youngson added: ''The Government is considering amended
legislation. It is not just a matter of the deer being a nuisance, they
could be a danger in public parks and to motorists.''
One solution, he suggested, would be for Forest Enterprise to organise
shoots to reduce their numbers.
Forest Enterprise recommended the erection of a fence around affected
gardens or the use of a commercial repellent called ''lion's dung''.
Mr Alasdair MacLeod, Forest Enterprise's district forester for
Smithton, near Inverness said: ''If that is spread round the garden, it
frightens the blighters off. We are sympathetic but there is not an
awful lot we can do.''

<TEXT>
FOUR Irish republican prisoners last night were taking part in the
''dirty protest'' at Whitemoor jail, a prison service spokesman said.
Convicted Irish National Liberation Army men Martin McGonagle and Liam
Heffernan were understood to have joined the protest started by IRA
prisoners at the jail.
Felim O hAdhmail and Patrick Kelly began wearing only blankets and
smearing excrement on their cells after being transferred to the prison
from Full Sutton, Humberside, last week.
Two other jailed terrorists at other prisons were thought to be
considering similar protests. Mr Jerry McFlynn, of the Irish Commission
for Prisoners Overseas, said it could escalate into a hunger strike.
''It is a possibility. The situation is bad and it could escalate,''
he told a news conference in London organised by Saoirse, the campaign
for the release of republican prisoners.
O hAdhmail's wife, Mairead, blamed the authorities for transferring
her husband to the special secure unit at Whitemoor, where a stricter
regime was in force.
She claimed that he was confined to a cell 24 hours a day with the
lights left on permanently after he refused to sign an agreement to do
prison work.
Labour MP Ken Livingstone accused Home Secretary Michael Howard of
deliberately heightening tensions by blocking the early release of
republican prisoners and the transfer of those held in England to jails
closer to their homes.
Four non-aligned terrorist prisoners refused breakfast in the Irish
Republic's high security Portlaoise jail yesterday as they began a
hunger strike.
They were said to be protesting at the alleged preferential treatment
over parole being given to IRA personnel in the County Laois prison, 50
miles from Dublin.

DETAILS of a #30m conference centre, to be built on to Glasgow's
Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre beside the Clyde, were
revealed yesterday.
The shell-shaped building, capable of seating more than 3000
delegates, will be financed by Glasgow District Council and run by the
SECC's management. Mr Pat Lally, the council leader, said it had secured
Government funding and the building should be completed by June 1997.
It would, it was claimed, put the city on the world conference map,
trebling the number of delegates who currently attend events at the SECC
from around 50,000 to 150,000.
Unveiling a scale model of the building -- which, it was conceded,
looks like the shell of an armadillo -- Mr Lally said the project would
create around 900 jobs and generate #24m for the Glasgow economy.
The design has been approved by the Royal Fine Art Commission for
Scotland and will go before the council's planning committee at the end
of this month.
Mr Lally said the new centre would not be in direct competition with
Edinburgh's International Conference Centre, which is due to open in
September. ''Our competitors are international not parochial,'' he
added.
The building has been designed by a team of architects headed by Sir
Norman Foster, who beat six rival bids submitted to the council earlier
this year.
Explaining that the building owed its design to the hulls of boats
once built on the Clyde, with apologies to the Sydney Opera House, Sir
Norman said the centre would enhance Glasgow's reputation as a city of
innovative architecture.
He said the glass-fronted building would be encased in aluminium with
a 40-year lifespan. ''The building will be unique in function and
dramatic in appearance. Most importantly, it will be memorable, a
landmark for Glasgow both by day and night.''
He said the building, 40m high and more than 135m long, incorporated
the biggest capacity auditorium in the UK along with additional meeting
rooms and bars. The plan includes an oval car park linked to the SECC's
existing car parks and corridors leading to the Moat House Hotel.

A YOUTH who started a fire which caused almost #1.5m damage to a
school was put on probation for three years yesterday when he appeared
before Lord Macfadyen at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The judge told Khristopher Duncan, 17, that he accepted he had not
intended the ''catastrophic results'' of his actions.
Duncan, of Ladyton, Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, set fire to polythene
which was protruding from a hole in the roof of the school.
The resulting blaze destroyed 60% of Ladyton primary and damaged a
fire tender.
Duncan was playing on the roof of the school with two friends, aged 13
and 11, during the holidays in July last year, when he noticed the
polythene sticking through the roof.
He put a lighter to it, then dropped it back through the hole. He and
his friends climbed down from the roof and thought that the material had
stopped burning.
However, when they looked back they saw the school engulfed in flames
and smoke.
It is estimated that, if it is decided to demolish and rebuild the
school, it will cost #1.2m, and the damage to contents totalled more
than #200,000.
Duncan originally admitted culpably and recklessly causing the fire
when he appeared at the High Court in Glasgow.
Sentence was deferred until yesterday for background reports.
Defence counsel Gerald Carroll said Duncan was an immature youth who
had immediately expressed his regret for the incident.
He had been under the impression that the material which was lit had
actually extinguished itself.
Lord Macfadyen told Duncan that, in the circumstances, he was prepared
to place the youth on probation for three years with a condition that in
the first 12 months of the order he attend an alternative-to-custody
project for 120 hours.

RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin admitted today he had a heart attack
on July 10, but said he now feels better.
''Something unpleasant happened to me on the 10th, in general a heart
attack as a result of ischaemia,'' he told Russia's Channel One
television.
Doctors say Yeltsin has suffered from ischaemia, or problems with the
blood supply to the heart, for some time, but this was the first
reference to him having a heart attack.
It was also the first time he had appeared in an interview since being
rushed into a Moscow hospital.
''After two days I was already calm and now I am recovering,'' he
said, adding: ''The doctors say the recovery will be full without any
after-effects, with a return to intensive work and sport.''
The interview was conducted in a corridor on the third floor of the
hospital, with Yeltsin standing for the entire five to seven minutes.
He discussed Chechen peace talks and other political issues in
addition to his health. He spoke in a raspy voice but occasionally
gesticulated emphatically to make a point.
He said he planned to play tennis again soon, although he said his
doctors were not telling him exactly when he'd be allowed to leave
hospital.
He conceded that ''some time will be required for recovery'' and a
spokesman confirmed for the first time that he faces an extended period
of convalescence at a Moscow sanitorium.
He looked fit in footage of him on the same channel holding a morning
meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
Dressed in a sports shirt and tracksuit trousers, Yeltsin shook hands
with Chernomyrdin and Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav Mikhailov before
sitting down for talks with them.
Chernomyrdin kissed Yeltsin and gave him a large bunch of roses and
sunflowers saying: ''To a healthy man!''
Yeltsin appeared to be speaking freely and he did not have the
puffiness around his eyes and the stiff walk which fuelled speculation
about his health even before his latest heart problem.
That speculation reached new heights earlier today with the release of
a photograph which looked identical to film taken three months ago.
The photograph showed Yeltsin, 64, in a short-sleeved sports shirt
seated at a desk, an exact repeat of film footage of him shot during a
holiday in southern Russia on April 3.
Both show him sitting at a desk in the same mainly white sport shirt,
with four telephones at his left elbow arranged in the same way and
bearing the same markings. The room's wallpaper and folds in the
curtains appeared identical.
Yeltsin's chief press spokesman later insisted the picture was new,
despite the unmistakable similarities between the old and supposedly new
images.
''I, with all responsibility, confirm that the photo was taken last
week on Friday in the Central Clinic-Hospital on the third floor,'' the
spokesman said outside the hospital.
On the thorny problem of the Chechen crisis, which aides said last
week had contributed to the stress that landed him in hospital, Yeltsin
said he had found a solution to three or four ''issues of principle'' to
present to the Chechen side.
These include the status of Chechnya, which lies at the heart of the
conflict and has proved a major stumbling block.
''We found a solution, of course our own solution, which will be
offered to the Chechen side,'' Yeltsin said.
In Chechnya itself, however, continued fighting between rebels and
Russian troops showed how much remained to be done.
The commander of a unit loyal to rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev said
the Chechens could keep fighting.
''We have the power to continue the war. But we don't want our people
to die. The toughest outstanding question at talks in Grozny now is
whether Russia recognises Chechnya's independence before or after
elections,'' said Vakhid Murdachev.--Reuter/AP.

A KASHMIRI separatist group kept Indian officials and Western
diplomats guessing today about the fate of five Western hostages after
it refused to extend a deadline and threatened to kill them.
Tension mounted as tape-recorded messages from the captives asked
Indian authorities and their governments for help an hour before last
night's deadline expired. The little-known Al Faran group had wanted
India to agree to the release of 20 arrested guerrillas by then.
Meanwhile, Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Hanley today issued an
urgent appeal for the ''swift and safe release'' of the two British
hostages, Mr Keith Mangan, 33, from Middlesbrough, and 23-year-old Paul
Wells, from London.
He said the continued detention of the two men, along with three
others, was ''inflicting unjustified suffering on the hostages and their
families''.
Mr Hanley warned the group that the continued detentions would not
ease problems in Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state in
predominately Hindu India.
A cassette made by the hostages and released to the media yesterday
revealed that they had been made to walk along Himalayan tracks as they
were moved from place to place to avoid detection.
Al Faran also sent a statement to the media reiterating an earlier
threat to kill the hostages, but indicating that there was still room
for India to strike a deal.
''I don't know if I'll be killed today or tomorrow,'' American Donald
Hutchings had said in the recording.
Norwegian Hans Ostro appealed to the Indian and Norwegian governments
to help win his release, but retained a sense of humour and said he was
enjoying nature.
Norwegian foreign minister Bjorn Tore Godal today urged the militants
to release the hostages on humanitarian grounds.
''On behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of Norway, I would like
to make an urgent and sincere appeal for the immediate release on
humanitarian grounds of the five hostages from four countries currently
being held in Kashmir,'' he said.
Al Faran said in its statement: ''We made contact with the Indian
government three days ago but the government does not seem to be
prepared for any purposeful talks.''
It added that the international community, particularly those
governments appealing for the release of the hostages, should put
pressure on India to help them win their freedom.
Criticising India's human rights record, Al Faran said the world was
concerned about five Western hostages but thousands of rapes and murders
in Kashmir were being ignored.
India says Pakistan, which claims Kashmir, funds and supplies Kashmir
guerrillas with arms. Islamabad denies the charge.--Reuter.

WIMBLEDON champion Steffi Graf, who is usually more at home on the
Centre Court, walked down the catwalk today at the end of the launch of
her first fashion collection.
The 26-year-old's recent Wimbledon triumph has been overshadowed by an
investigation into her tax affairs which has been splashed across the
German newspapers for the last week.
However Graf, who has hinted that she may leave Germany because of the
tax problems, refused to answer any more questions about her financial
affairs.
She said she had spent her time since the Wimbledon triumph 10 days
ago working on the fashion show.
''After Wimbledon I have devoted all of the last week to my
collection. After my career is finished I would like to do more in the
fashion business,'' Graf said.
Earlier, the champion said she was looking forward to the return of
former rival Monica Seles to the women's tennis circuit next month.
Seles has not played since being knifed in the back by a spectator in
Germany two years ago.
''Obviously I am the first one who hopes for her to come back,''
German ace Graf said. ''I hope she is going to have fun with what she is
doing and I look forward to her coming back.''
Former world No 1 Seles -- who has been out of the sport since she was
stabbed during a match at the Hamburg Open in April 1993 -- has applied
for an entry to the US Open which starts at the end of August.
She has hinted she may play a few tournaments beforehand and is due to
play an exhibition against veteran Martina Navratilova in Atlantic City
on July 29.
''I think all the players knew (about the comeback) for a couple of
weeks now and I think they are trying to welcome her,'' Graf told a news
conference.--Reuter.

THE Tall Ships Race fleet got off to the slowest possible start for
the 1300-mile voyage last night when it was becalmed in the Firth of
Forth for two hours.
Thousands of sightseers lined the shores of the estuary and hundreds
more put to sea yesterday to give the 100 vessels a fitting send-off on
the 400-mile first stage of the Cutty Sark race, from Scotland to
Bremerhaven, Germany.
The armada was due to set sail at 6pm but, in the words of official
spokeswoman Libby Elles, the Forth was ''like a duckpond'' when the
vital hour came around, and the departure time was put back until 8pm.
The Princess Royal was the face that eventually launched the 100
vessels -- cutters and ketches, schooners and sloops, brigs and
barquentines, and the rest -- on the initial stage.
Earlier, she reviewed the fleet of majestic sailing ships from the
Pharos, flagship of the Northern Lighthouse Board, of which she is
patron, before transferring to HMS York to fire the starting gun.

<HEADLINE>MPs want better ways to beat breast cancer</HEADLINE>

A COMMITTEE of MPs yesterday called for a national network of
specialist units to reduce the death toll from breast cancer.
Britain has one of the world's highest recorded death rates for breast
cancer -- 39.47 per 100,000 of the population; higher than any other
developed country except Denmark.
Each year 26,000 women in the UK are diagnosed as having the disease,
and 15,000 die.
The Commons Select Committee on Health began in March examining ways
in which services could be improved, taking evidence from a wide range
of experts.
Several patients who submitted evidence to the committee believed
their breast cancer had not been diagnosed quickly enough, and that
their doctors were not sufficiently expert in treating the disease.
The committee's report, published yesterday, concluded there was no
satisfactory answer as to why so many women in Britain died from breast
cancer.
But it added: ''The most worrying explanation . . . would be that the
UK's poor survival rates may be due, at least in part, to poor treatment
of the disease.''
The MPs called for a nationwide survey of regional variations in
treatment and clinical outcomes to evaluate the likely effectiveness of
breast cancer units.
A Scottish survey aimed at determining best practice, carried out by
the Scottish Cancer Therapy Network, is due to be published within the
next few weeks.
The breast cancer audit -- based on the outcome for all 5000 breast
cancer patients in the years 1987 and 1993 -- will look at how treatment
regimes have changed in the intervening period, and whether women do
better at specialist centres or general hospitals.
Dr Tim Habeshaw, clinical director of the Beatson Oncology Centre at
the Western Infirmary in Glasgow, said one of the issues surrounding
breast cancer care was the setting-up of cancer units to complement the
work of the five centres in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, and
Inverness.
Patients requiring radiotherapy go to one of these, but other
treatments are available at teaching or district general hospitals.
Referring all patients to one of the five centres would require heavy
investment there, but setting up specialist units would provide care
nearer the patient's home.
Dr Habeshaw said: ''That would probably mean more cases being
concentrated on fewer hospitals -- it is how we get to that that is
occupying the health boards.''
The MPs also concluded that breast screening alone would not succeed
in reducing mortality, and recommended that the upper age limit for
routine breast screening should be raised to 69 from 64 at present.

<HEADLINE>UN chief says Burundi committed to peace</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UN chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali ended his African tour today saying he
was sure that leaders in Burundi were committed to reconciliation and
avoiding an ethnic bloodbath as suffered by Rwanda.
''I am convinced that there is a political will among the leaders of
the Burundi community to consolidate national reconciliation and avoid
conflicts,'' Boutros-Ghali told a news conference before flying to
Geneva to focus his attention on the worsening crisis in Bosnia.
He said his talks in Burundi, which has the same ethnic make-up as
Rwanda where up to one million people died in ethnic killings last year,
centred on how to make peace between members of the Hutu and Tutsi
tribes.
''I had constructive and positive discussions with all Burundi leaders
including the military, the opposition and the government,''
Boutros-Ghali said.
During his visit, he announced an inquiry into 22 months of slaughter
that followed the assassination of Burundi's first freely-elected Hutu
president, Melchior Ndadaye, by Tutsi troops in October 1993.
Some 50,000 people were killed in the two months after Ndadaye's death
and tens of thousands have died since then.
The inquiry was the only result to emerge from Boutros-Ghali's talks
with Burundi's feuding parties but diplomats said it alone would not
stop killings.
The secretary-general said he held talks with Ethiopian President
Meles Zenawi on the political situation on the world's poorest
continent. Meles is current chairman of the Organisation of African
Unity.
He said he had in particular discussed with Meles and OAU chief Salim
Ahmed Salim the poor ties between Egypt, his motherland, and
neighbouring Sudan.
The two countries have been locked in a war of words since a failed
assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last month.
Boutros-Ghali defended his decision to go ahead with the African tour
despite the crisis in Bosnia.
''The visit was a demonstration that the UN was paying the same
attention to African problems as it was paying to European problems such
as in former Yugoslavia.''--Reuter.

<TEXT>
FRANCE and Canada have joined an international chorus of governments
and human rights groups urging Nigeria's military ruler to commute
sentences on alleged coup plotters, including ex-head of state Olusegun
Obasanjo.
''We call on General Sani Abacha and the Provisional Ruling Council
(PRC) to show clemency and respect the basic rights of the defence,'' a
French Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Paris.
And in a statement by its embassy in Lagos, Canada questioned the
credibility of sentences passed in a secret trial internationally
condemned. ''We urge the Nigerian authorities, in reviewing the
sentences, to exercise maximum restraint and clemency for all accused,''
it said.
United Nations Secretary-General Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali has also
voiced his concern.
Defence headquarters last Friday announced that 40 people had been
sentenced by a military tribunal, the culmination of an investigation
and trial shrouded in secrecy since the government said it uncovered a
plot to topple it on March 1.
Independent newspapers say Obasanjo, a retired general, has been
jailed for life while his former number two, retired Major-General Shehu
Musa Yar'Adua, and 13 others were given death sentences.
The trial and lack of democracy in Nigeria has earned the country
international condemnation, particularly from the United States and
Britain.
Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker warned the military regime
that Nigeria may be barred from the Commonwealth summit in New Zealand
in November because of the coup trial.
France, however, which has vast economic interest in the African
country, has been virtually silent until now.
Nigeria has been in crisis since the previous army ruler annulled the
1993 presidential election that was meant to end a decade of military
rule. The undeclared winner, Moshood Abiola, has been in detention since
June last year on treason charges.
Information Minister Walter Ofonagoro said today that the United
States had cancelled visas he and his two children held to visit the US.
A US embassy official said the measure was consistent with US policy
in place since December 1993 after Abacha seized power. -- Reuter.

<HEADLINE>North Sea gas deal creates jobs for 250</HEADLINE>

AROUND 250 construction jobs will be created in Northeast Scotland as
a result of the decision by Chevron and Conoco to process gas at the
Scottish Area Gas Evacuation terminal at St Fergus from their giant
Britannia Field in the North Sea.
The joint operators of the #1500m Britannia development, one of the
biggest in the North Sea, have reached agreement with Mobil to use an
expanded SAGE terminal rather than build a new dedicated one, the final
major issue of the Britannia development to be resolved.
The Scottish National Party campaigned vigorously to oppose ''the
great Scottish gas robbery'' which it feared when Teesside was
considered for a landfall for the gas.
Britannia is the first large gas reserve to be sold entirely to the
independent gas market, and agreements have been reached with four
purchasers -- Kinetica Ltd, Mobil Gas Marketing (UK) Ltd, National Power
plc, and Total Oil Marine plc.
It was announced at the end of last year that St Fergus would be the
landfall but at that stage it was not decided how the gas would be
handled.
''I am delighted that we have been able to agree with Mobil, the SAGE
operator, on the use of these facilities,'' said Mr Jim Briggs,
Britannia's development director.
''We will pay a competitive tariff giving us long-term use of SAGE for
Britannia production and for any additional gas gathered from the
greater Britannia area.''
SAGE, in which 13 companies have a stake, with Mobil holding the
largest percentage, already handles gas from the Beryl, Brae, and Scott
fields. Britannia gas and natural gas liquid (NGL) will be co-mingled
with products from the other fields, offering operational benefits and a
more secure gas supply.
If planning approval is given, the new facilities at the terminal will
include the construction of a by-pass process train.
This will add more than 740 million standard cubic feet of gas per day
to the current 1150 million a day of the terminal's two existing process
trains.
''By adding on to existing plant and infrastructure the Britannia
expansion at SAGE will provide maximum benefits to the community with
minimum disruption,'' said Mr Lance Johnson, chairman of Mobil North Sea
Ltd.
''In the short term the project, costing more than #70m, will create
some 250 construction jobs, many of which we hope would be filled
locally. Ultimately, the project will add about 20 people to SAGE's
workforce taking the total to 150.''
Britannia is the biggest undeveloped gas field in the UK sector of the
North Sea with estimated recoverable reserves of 2.6 trillion cubic feet
of gas and 140 million barrels of condensate and natural gas liquids.
Peak production capacity is 740 million standard cubic feet of gas and
70,000 barrels of condensate with a field life of up to 30 years.
The operators are hoping for planning approval early next year and
construction will take approximately two years.
The move was welcomed by SNP leader Alex Salmond, the local MP, who
said: ''The announcement comes as the culmination of a long hard-fought
campaign by the people of Banff and Buchan and the prospect of 250
additional jobs will certainly be welcomed in and around St Fergus.''

<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Brazil finally signed an extradition treaty yesterday, 25
years after Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs settled in Rio de Janeiro.
However, Biggs will almost certainly remain free -- at least for the
time being, according to officials from both countries.
''We are one step nearer in the sense that there is now an extradition
treaty but, frankly, the chances of him coming back are pretty remote,''
said a spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service, which would have
to submit any extradition request.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz
Lampreia put the seal on extensive negotiations at a signing ceremony in
London.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ''It is retroactive, which is quite
normal, so a person who committed an offence before the treaty came into
effect should not be allowed to escape.''
However, he added: ''Just because it's signed today doesn't mean it
comes into immediate effect. It needs to be ratified by both
governments.
''So don't expect anyone on the next plane.''
The Home Office, which has overall responsibility for extradition
matters, confirmed that ''there are no wheels in motion'' over Biggs,
although officially the Government will always seek the return to
custody of escapers.
Biggs, who broke out of Wandsworth jail almost exactly 30 years ago,
settled in Rio in 1970 and has thwarted all attempts to seize him.
The birth of his son Mike 20 years ago boosted his case, as he is a
Brazilian national who is still regarded there as a dependant of Biggs.
Brazil's foreign relations ministry said Biggs may also be able to
claim that his conviction for the 1963 raid on the Glasgow-to-London
night train should be considered lapsed under Brazilian law.

A MAN suffers from a condition which compels him to pester his former
mother-in-law with phone calls, a court was told yesterday.
Andrew Steel admitted making dozens of calls to Mrs Jean Logan, 68,
late at night and in the early hours.
His lawyer, James McCann, claimed he had been under the influence of
Othello syndrome, which he described as ''a morbid jealousy''.
Mr McCann told Dumbarton Sheriff Court that the condition was
triggered by Steel's divorce from Mrs Logan's daughter 13 years ago.
Steel, 45, of Burnside Court, Clydebank, was arrested after police
recorded calls and set up video surveillance on a public phone box.
Sentence on Steel, who was charged with causing a breach of the peace
by making menacing or threatening calls, was deferred until next month
for reports.
