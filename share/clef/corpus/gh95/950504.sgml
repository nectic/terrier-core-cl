Eric Kennedy visits Scotland's latest tourist attraction in Ayrshire
BRITAIN'S biggest carousel, a historic ruined castle, a fun park
complete with ghost train and helter skelter, a museum, and a pets'
corner are only some of the reasons for the early success of Scotland's
newest visitor attraction.
The accent is firmly on fun at the 500-acre Loudoun Castle Park near
Galston in Ayrshire. In fact it verges on the compulsory as you tour the
attractions with chairman Peter Clery.
''The big kick is seeing so many people get so much pleasure from
it,'' he says.
''We have a unique facility here -- a combination of leisure, heritage
and amusement park like no other in Scotland. And once the admission
price is paid, the rides are free.''
Loudoun Castle Park offers all the ingredients for the ideal family
day out, with parents able to relax in a secluded setting while the kids
let off steam.
The weather can't spoil things either, there is a huge indoor play
barn and visitor centre featuring a whole series of amusements for
youngsters and a cafe where their parents can relax and have a coffee or
snack. It also has an information centre, with an area which can be
divided into classrooms for lessons on the estate and castle's history,
the world of nature, and farming.
There is a museum, which features a perfect scale model of Loudoun
Castle before the disastrous fire which ruined it in 1941. A
coin-operated mechanism brings it to light and life as a computerised
tape commentary by Bill Torrance tells the castle's story and of what
happened that fateful night.
Once known as the Windsor of Scotland, Loudoun Castle was the
ancestral home of the Campbells of Loudoun and had more than 90
apartments including an entrance hall 70ft x 30ft in size.
Even in its derelict and fenced-off state the castle is an imposing
centrepiece to a leisure park with an unusual sense of history. In its
south garden grows the Auld Yew Tree where the drafts of the Treaty of
Union were negotiated, the Earl of Loudoun of the time being joint
Secretary of State for Scotland. The tree is believed to be about 700
years old.
It has been witness to some grand occasions and famous people down the
centuries, including Dr Samuel Johnson and James Boswell in October,
1773, but no changes have been so dramatic as in the past year when the
estate has been carefully transformed into the family mecca it is today.
New access paths have been built between avenues of 150-year-old
pines. The walled garden's four acres might date back 200 years, but its
walls now enclose the fun park. And nature trails now take the visitor
through magnificent bluebell woods and past hosts of rhododendron bushes
which once gladdened only privileged eyes.
My own tour of the park was punctuated by conversations with a variety
of families. One father, from nearby Galston, revealed that he and his
children were on their third visit. Another family, from Glasgow, were
there because of word-of-mouth recommendation. This when the park had
been opened for only a fortnight.
The park is sure to win many more friends with its unique blend of fun
and romantic surroundings. It is little more than half-an-hour from
Glasgow and is even more accessible to the big population centres of
Ayrshire such as Ayr and Kilmarnock. And the M77 extension will bring it
even closer.
It is well signposted from the A77, with even more signposts planned,
and its entrance is impossible to miss: a new and impressive driveway
takes the visitor right to the pay barrier and on to the car park.
It is all part of a #2.5m investment under which buildings have been
restored, new facilities built, landscaping and parking provision done,
picnic areas provided and pathways laid in order to make it an ideal
choice for a family day out.
''Once people are in, they don't have to worry about money,'' says
Peter Clery.
''It's useful for the shop, cafe and games but really that's it. The
children have the freedom of the park's 500 acres and we think they will
have a memorable day.
''All they have to do is have fun. And I would say that on the
evidence, they will.''

A GROUP of five Victorian heraldic stained-glass windows have been
restored to the dining room of Glamis Castle, Forfar, the Queen Mother's
family home.
The five windows -- untouched since they were installed in 1852 --
were restored on Fair Isle off Shetland by stained-glass engraver
Patrick Ross Smith, assisted by Aberdeen Art College graduate Ailsa
Murray whose home is on Fair Isle.
Mr Smith said: ''The windows were taken out, taken by van to Aberdeen
harbour, and then by ship to Lerwick and on by another ship to Fair
Isle.''
He said the lead had become very weak in the windows and they were in
danger of collapsing. He also restored the ornate plaster-work and
cleaned and reset the glass.
Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Cardwell-Moore, castle custodian, said:
''The five windows, each 4ft square, depict in heraldic coats of arms,
the evolution of the Strathmore family from Sir John Lyon in 1372 to the
12th Earl of Strathmore, the Queen Mother's great uncle in 1852.''
The motto in the window shown translates: ''In you, master, we put our
trust.''

STRIKING Post Office staff yesterday voted overwhelmingly to return to
work and pledged to restore normal services to the public in Scotland as
quickly as possible.
Union officials, maintaining the disruption to postal services had
been caused by the Royal Mail management, apologised to customers and
said they would pull out all the stops to clear the backlog of mail with
priority going to businesses.
Mr John Keggie, a member of the national executive of the Union of
Communications Workers and divisional officer for Scotland, said his
members, who had twice defied union pleas to go back to work, were
returning with dignity.
Speaking after a meeting in Edinburgh, where emotions ran high among
the 2500 postal workers from the city, Fife and the Borders, Mr Keggie
claimed a management climbdown and said the unofficial dispute could
have been averted.
''What we have actually secured is what we said we would be prepared
to accept last week and management rejected.''
Postmen and postwomen, who heard that a hit-list of 21 ''ringleaders''
was ''in the bucket'' and no-one would face disciplinary action,
returned to work yesterday afternoon.
It is likely to be the middle of next week before normal deliveries
are resumed.
Only a small number of staff voiced opposition to the union pleas, one
commenting they had ''been sold down the river''.
One union official told the packed Assembly Rooms they had
''frightened John Mackay to death'' referring to the director and
general manager of Royal Mail Scotland.
The hour-long Edinburgh meeting, where members were told they had
secured a victory and could go back ''with heads held high'', took place
a few hours after 300 Post Office staff in Glasgow voted to return to
work.
Later Mr Mackay welcomed the end of ''the wildcat strike'' which he
described as totally unnecessary and pointless.
The action began with a one-day stoppage on Monday in protest at the
shifting of the traditional May Day holiday to May 8 to mark VE-Day. It
continued as anger erupted over working practices to deal with the
backlog.
Asked if he felt the dispute, which earlier in the week ended up in
the courts, had damaged the postal service, Mr Keggie said management
had chosen not to use the very good industrial relations set-up in
existence.
''They could have negotiated with us last Thursday or Friday or over
the weekend. They chose to dig in. They have now had to come out their
own trench and meet the union's requirements.''
Mr Keggie denied the action had severely damaged the new Labour
movement which leader Tony Blair was trying create.
The workers were angry, he said, over management ''trying to take out
second deliveries behind the backdoor and actually hoodwinking the
public''.
''It certainly isn't old-style trade unionism. I think what we have
seen here is a show of strength from rank and file postmen and
postwomen. They are trying to defend the service to the customer to whom
they are loyal.
''We have now secured an agreement where our members feel safe their
terms and conditions will be protected and I think the members have
demonstrated to Royal Mail management that if they contemplate attacking
the second delivery service in Scotland they would possibly face the
same hostility in future.''
Mr Alan Johnston, joint general secretary who flew from London for the
meeting, said the Royal Mail, if there were industrial problems, should
discuss them through the normal channels. The courts were no substitute
for proper negotiations.

A ROBBER who left his 64-year-old victim in a coma with brain injuries
after deliberately driving a van at him was jailed for seven years
yesterday.
Mr William Melrose is now bedridden and can move only his eyes and
fingers, Lord Milligan was told at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Labourer Edward Beattie, 28, had already broken into Mr Melrose's home
to steal a bank book and cash, but needed further identification before
he could withdraw money from Mr Melrose's bank account.
He decided to knock Mr Melrose off his bike in a quiet country road,
but the plan went disastrously wrong when the elderly man smashed into
the windscreen, suffering a fractured skull and brain damage.
Beattie, of Lintburn Place, Galashiels, admitted assaulting Mr Melrose
to his severe injury on January 10 this year on an unclassified road on
the Bowhill Estate, Selkirk, by driving a van at him and knocking him
down with intent to rob him.
He was originally charged with attempting to murder Mr Beattie, of
Newmarkmill Cottages, on the Bowhill Estate, but the Crown accepted his
plea to the reduced charge.
He also admitted that he had broken into Mr Melrose's home on January
9, stealing a bank book and cash.
Beattie further pled guilty to attempting to defraud the Royal Bank of
Scotland on January 9 and 10 by claiming that he was entitled to
withdraw money from Mr Melrose's account.
Mr Iain Duguid, advocate-depute, told the court that Beattie had once
lived on the estate where Mr Melrose worked at the sawmill.
It seemed to have been assumed in the area that Mr Melrose would have
a quantity of cash at home.
Mr Duguid said that two days after the break-in Beattie had turned up
with #2500 in bundles of #10 notes to buy a car.
He had twice tried to obtain money using his victim's stolen bank
book, but was told he would need additional identification.
He stole a van in Hawick and set out to lie in wait for Mr Melrose who
cycled home on the estate road.
''The intention was to obtain some identification off Mr Melrose in
order to complete what had earlier been attempted, to withdraw money
from the bank,'' Mr Duguid added.
He said that Mr Melrose had recovered from coma, but doctors believed
he would be permanently bedridden.

Twenty-five customers who blanched at paying #415,000 for a 200mph
supercar have reached an out-of-court settlement with the manufacturer.
The would-be buyers of the Jaguar XJ220s were unwilling or unable to
meet the asking price, having put their names down for the cars in the
late 80s. They have now agreed to pay #100,000 which clears them of any

THE fishing industry has reacted furiously to the publication
yesterday of draft guidelines for the abandonment of offshore
installations, accusing the Government of bending over backwards to help
the oil industry.
They have also expressed fears for the lives and livelihoods of
Scottish fishermen as a result of a network of abandoned pipelines and
platform stumps in the North Sea, left there to save money.
The row came as two marine biologists warned that pollution in the
North Sea caused by working oil rigs was much greater than is being
officially acknowledged, and marine life was being obliterated over wide
areas of the sea-bed.
Meanwhile Greenpeace supporters prepared for a long haul yesterday as
they took 20 tonnes of stores on board Brent Spar, which they have
occupied in a bid to prevent it from being dumped. They warned of
''further action'' in the North Sea.
Announcing the draft guidelines for oil installation abandonment,
Energy Minister Tim Eggar said: ''We need to be sure that our approach
to the large and costly abandonment exercise is right.
''It has three key elements: the need to meet our international
obligations, including those on the environment and fisheries; the need
for sensible and proportionate decisions on abandonment programmes; and
the need for speedy procedures which minimise burdens on industry.''
According to the proposals the removal of installations and pipelines
will be assessed on a case-by-case approach.
Last night Mr Michael Sutherland of the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation expressed deep concern at the proposals, which the federation
is waiting to study.
He said the SFF had put forward proposals it wanted included but even
before the publication of the draft the Government had pre-empted them
by announcing a reduction in the clearance of the installation
''stumps'' from 75 metres to 55 metres.
''We are filled with horror and dismay at what they are planning,'' he
said.
''As well as reducing the clearance to 55 metres they are also talking
about partial removal. They are bending over backwards to accommodate
the oil industry on this.
''When oil was found on our doorstep we were given promises by the
Government and the oil companies that all would be removed at the end of
the day.
''We have seen them do nothing but backtrack over the past 20 years.
In the international sphere the UK Government has been a prime mover in
seeking to change international legislation and give legitimacy to
partial removal.
''Obviously all of this is bad news for the fishing industry. This new
55-metre cut-off means what is going to be left is essentially a
Scottish problem because most of the platforms in the English sector
will come out. Because the platforms in our sector are in deeper water
we will be left with the stumps.''
Meanwhile, British marine biologist John Gray of Oslo University says
hydrocarbons from drilling wastes discharged from working rigs are
obliterating marine life over wide areas of the sea-bed.
The pollution could be damaging fish stocks, including cod -- whose
numbers have declined by two-thirds in the past 15 years -- haddock, and
plaice.
Mr Gray's findings, reported in New Scientist, are based on data
collected in the Norwegian sector, but he said pollution in the British
sector -- where discharges were known to have been much greater -- was
likely to be much worse.
However, he claimed, information on the British sector was hard to
come by because the Government cloaked research findings in secrecy.
He told New Scientist that hydrocarbon levels were rising round the
oilfields of the North Sea and Shetland Basin, and added: ''There is a
great reluctance in Britain to look into it, because of a fear of what
might be found.''

INDEPENDENT investigations have concluded that the three cases of
necrotising fasciitis at Falkirk Royal Infirmary between October and
February were unconnected.
Reports published by two doctors yesterday say there was no evidence
of the disease being contracted in the hospital -- run by Falkirk and
District Royal Infirmary NHS Trust -- and broadly support the action
that was taken by staff to deal with the three cases.
However they criticise the way one of the cases was notified, and
question the promptness with which two of the patients were taken for
surgery in response to the outbreak.
The inquiries were commissioned by the hospital trust and were carried
out by Dr Peter Christie, consultant epidemiologist at the Scottish
Centre for Infection and Environmental Health at Ruchill Hospital in
Glasgow, and Mr Hugh Forrest, a surgeon with the Western Infirmary Trust
in Glasgow and Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons in Glasgow.
In October, Mrs Linda Smith, 29, of Bonnybridge, contracted the
so-called flesh-eating bug a few days after giving birth in the hospital
by caesarean section. She survived.
In January, Miss Liz Sutherland, of Bothkennar, near Grangemouth,
Stirlingshire, died of the disease a day before her 72nd birthday after
being admitted with a sore throat.
The following month Mrs Gladys McDonald, 69, of Stenhousemuir, died a
few days after a routine operation. Her family asked for an independent
inquiry.
Dr Christie's report concludes that there was no epidemiological
evidence to link any of the cases to each other, or to the hospital.
''It appears likely that the three Falkirk cases represent an
unfortunate cluster of unrelated cases occurring over a relatively short
period of time,'' says the report.
Dr Christie notes that Mrs Smith and Mrs McDonald received lower doses
of benzylpenicillin that those recommended a year ago by the UK Action
Group on NF, and that neither had received another antibiotic,
clindamycin, which was also recommended for severe cases. However there
had been some debate about alternative regimes.
His main criticism concerned the way his department, and the local
director of public health, were informed of Mrs McDonald's case.
''It is a matter of regret both to local Departments of Public Health
Medicine and to the SCIEH that these cases are not always rapidly
reported for local and national surveillance purposes,'' the report
states.

THE pace-setting Scottish engineering firm Clyde Blowers is continuing
to reorganise by moving its Clydebank headquarters to a new more modern
factory site at Broad Street in Glasgow.
The move, which will be completed by mid-May, will concentrate the
firm's manufacture of specialist equipment for cleaning boilers and heat
exchangers on one site instead of two.
''Our strategy is to concentrate our machining and manufacturing on
one site to achieve economies of scale and greater efficiency,'' said
Clyde Blowers' head of marketing Gordon Logan.
The move, which began last week, will lead to the shutdown of Clyde
Blowers' small manufacturing operation at Wavre near Brussels in
Belgium.
This employs about 20 people making the machine gun-like equipment
that cleans the insides of boilers and heat exchangers in factories with
steam or compressed air while they continue to operate normally.
Mr Logan said most of the Belgian subsidiary's output had been in the
hands of sub-contractors anyway, but the Wavre unit would continue to
serve as a sales and service centre for northern European markets.
''I am pleased to say we can manufacture more efficiently in Scotland
than we can through Belgian sub-contractors,'' Mr Logan said.
But he warned that although the new Broad Street factory would be able
increase Clyde Blower's output of specialist cleaning gear, the shutdown
in Belgium would not immediately lead to extra jobs in Scotland.
Mr Logan said that besides manufacturing equipment for the European
and Japanese markets, the new factory will produce components for the
US.
These will be shipped out to Clyde Blower's recently acquired US
subsidiary, ABB Combustion Engineering, at Chattanooga, Tennessee for
final assembly.
Clyde Blowers has expanded rapidly since Jim McColl took over as chief
executive three years ago and embarked on a thorough reorganisation of
the then moribund firm.
Turnover leapt to #16.8m in the financial year to August 1994 from
#7.4m previously thanks to a series of acquisitions, although the firm
continued to make an operating loss.
Clyde Blowers, which is due to report its interim 1995 results next
week, currently employs 250 people.
About 70 will be based at its new Broad Street factory, a 20-year-old
building formerly occupied by mining equipment manufacturer Anderson
Strathclyde. Most of the remainder work at its factory for pneumatic
conveying equipment at Doncaster in Yorkshire.
Mr Logan declined to comment on the upcoming six-month results, but he
said: ''The company stands by all the optimistic comments it has made.''

MACDONALD Martin Distilleries, producers of Glenmorangie malt whisky,
are moving their head office and bottling plant from an old cramped
building in Leith to a new larger site at Broxburn near Edinburght
airport.
Company chairman Peter Maddrell said MacDonald Martin had bought the
new 32-acre Broxburn site, which includes a bottling plant, warehouses
and offices, from United Distillers for #4.25m.
The total cost of the move, due to take place in the spring of 1996,
would be close to #8m, but this would be partly offset by the sale of
MacDonald Martin's old 19th-century building in Leith, he said.
The six-acre site is situated directly opposite the new Scottish
Office in a part of Leith which is enjoying strong urban renewal and has
strong development potential.
The move to Broxburn forms part of MacDonald Martin's new strategy of
expansion and diversification. The company aims to sell less whisky in
bulk, while bottling and marketing more of its own produce.
''We have a growth strategy because we rely very heavily at present on
Glenmorangie and a few premium brands and we need to diversify the
business,'' Mr Maddrell said.
The independent company, which owns distilleries in Tain and Elgin,
charted a new more adventurous course after parting company with its
former managing director Neil McKerrow last June.
Peter Derbyshire, 44, a whisky marketing specialist who opened up
overseas markets for Famous Grouse and gave Drambuie a global image,
came on board last month to replace him.
Mr Maddrell said the move to Broxburn will enable MacDonald Martin to
double its presently bottling capacity to about two million cases per
year, cut costs and function more efficiently.
The new site has storage capacity for 300,000 casks, well in excess of
the company's present needs, so for a change MacDonald Martin will be
able to let out warehouse space instead of having to rent it.
Management will also allow be able to function more effectively in a
new open-plan office.
''We did look at building our own place, but it was very expensive and
we were very fortunate that United Distillers wanted to sell,'' Mr
Maddrell said.
As part of its growth and diversification strategy, MacDonald Martin
has begun promoting its Glen Moray malt in a different market niche just
below Glenmorangie and last December it launched a new premium blend
called Baillie Nicholl Jarvie.
The company, which saw interim pre-tax profits rise 22% to #2.6m,
announces its full-year results for the 12 months to March on May 25.

IT'S official -- according to the 1995 Good Weekend Guide, Edinburgh
offers the best value for money in Britain.
Many attractions in other towns and cities have been withdrawn from
the guide because they were considered boring and poor value for money.
''One great thing about Edinburgh is the number of free places to see,
such as the Museum of Childhood, Canongate; the Tolbooth and the Museum
of Scotland in Chambers Street. You can't get better than that for
value,'' said Mr Aird.
There is a certain geniality about Edinburgh -- a rather formal
''drawing room'' approach to living. After Paris and London, many
visitors favour Auld Reekie as the most non-cosmopolitan capital city
due to its excellent shopping, tasteful dining and an air of
old-worldliness that has become a dim memory for so many other
fast-paced cities.
Most first impressions of Edinburgh are one of an impossibly
extravagant stage setting. The backdrop of the Pentland Hills, with the
volcanic dome of Arthur's Seat rising in the wings is dramatic. Centre
stage is the castle, never out of view, towering majestically on the
summit of its basalt pedestal.
The flavour of Edinburgh radiates from the castle with its massive
stone walls, spires and towers. You can stroll past the kilted guards,
up narrow cobblestone passageways, to the powerful ramparts. Then wend
your way towards the eleventh century chapel built to honour the
Saint-Queen Margaret. Reputed to be the oldest building in the city, it
also claims to be Scotland's oldest church still in use.
The very skyline of Edinburgh is exciting. Towers and domes rub
shoulders with spires and follies. From the imposing castle, the Old
Town runs downhill towards the Palace of Holyroodhouse.
Along the Royal Mile, impressive sixteenth and seventeenth century
buildings are some of the nation's best attractions. St Giles Cathedral,
Old St Paul's Church and several buildings of Edinburgh University are
well worth visiting. Antique seekers can detour up the narrow closes in
search of treasures tucked into the crowded nooks of the curio shops.
In 1767 James Craig mapped out a magnificent series of streets,
squares and elegant crescents, thus creating Edinburgh's New Town. The
neo-classical architecture represents one of the most distinctive urban
environments of any European city.
But there's more to Edinburgh than history, museums and architecture
-- much more. The capital is about life today. Shopping is first class,
ranging from the world's oldest department store -- Jenners, to designer
boutiques in quaint Rose Street and quiet Thistle Street.
Scotland's latest theatre, the long-awaited Festival Theatre -- is the
finest of its kind -- with its giant stage and restored Art Deco
auditorium.
Dining out is fashionable in Edinburgh and the city now boasts many
world class restaurants. The recently formed Edinburgh Restaurant
Association is a collection of some of the country's finest eateries.
The city's pubs offer folk music, jazz and cabaret, reflecting the
sophisticated lifestyle Edinburgh assumes after dark as the lights which
appear to be strewn theatrically over its hills rekindle the fairytale
image.
For a small city, Edinburgh is graced with a number of excellent
hotels and guest houses. Outwith the three week period of the festival,
there are great weekend bargain breaks to be had.
The Edinburgh Tourist Board's Short Break programme lists many
establishments offering reduced rate packages that include bed and
breakfast for two nights. Sometimes dinner is included one night and,
for the other, a ticket to a performance in either the Playhouse --
Britain's largest theatre, the Festival Theatre or the newly refurbished
Royal Lyceum.

SHARES of investment banking group S G Warburg had slipped 7p to 814p
at the close of dealings yesterday as the company, which on Tuesday
announced it was in merger talks with Swiss Bank Corporation, issued a
shock profit warning, its third within nine months. The price could have
fallen further but there is still intense takeover speculation
surrounding the company with the possibility of a rival to Swiss Bank
being mooted. Initially the shares had gained 25p before see-sawing
during the day after the profit warning.
Analysts swiftly cut their profit projections after Warburg warned
that trading conditions have adversely affected the performance of the
investment bank and and profits for the group as a whole are expected to
be very significantly below the range of current market forecasts.
Warburg's 75% owned Mercury Asset Management arm, though, has operated
broadly in line with its expectations.
Analysts' projections had ranged between profits of #90m and #120m
with MAM contributing between #113m to #120m. So the investment banking
business could be in for a sizeable loss. BZW's banking analyst now
expects now expects Warburg only to have broken even in the year to
March 31, after a profit of #62.5m in the first half.
Apart from poor trading conditions, Warburg will have been hit by the
costs of restructuring which has taken place since the group's planned
merger with the US investment bank Morgan Stanley fell through in
December. These costs have been estimated by some analysts at between
#50m and #80m.
Any offer from SBC would not involve the whole group nor Mercury Asset
Management where Warburg's 75% stake would be expected to be distributed
to Warburg shareholders along with the proceeds of the sales of the
investment bank.

In Scotland, Andrew Douglas finds some of the best golf courses in the
world
WHETHER the first golf ball was struck in Holland or Scotland may well
be a topic of argument among golf historians, however, there is no doubt
that the game has developed to a greater degree in this country and St
Andrews remains a mecca for golfers. The Royal and Ancient Club at St
Andrews is recognised as the world authority on the rules of golf and
the Royal and Ancient Club's championship committee has the task of
organising The Open championship each year. This year the tournament
will be held over the Old Course at St Andrews between July 20 and 23.
To tee-off at the first on the Old Course in front of an ever-present
gallery may not be the most relaxing way to start a round of golf but it
is all part of the excitement and atmosphere that hangs over the course.
Away from it all, out in the country with not a soul in sight relaxation
is bliss, but ahead you have the tricky 17th Road Hole to overcome and
the last with its out of bounds down the right and huge green beckoning
a three-putt, particularly when the cosmopolitan gallery is substantial.
This essential enjoyment will cost you #50 per round from May to
November, a princely sum to play the most famous links course in the
world, but to have a round it is possible unlike Augusta, Georgia where
you will be lucky to get within a three-iron of the first tee. To play
over the Old Course a handicap certificate (a valuable document for the
travelling golfer) or letter of introduction from your home club is
required.
St Andrews' other courses are the New, Jubilee and Eden where green
fees are #25, #25 and #18 respectively. It would be unjust to leave Fife
without a mention to Elie where you will be guided off the first tee
with the help of a periscope, and Ladybank which offers a change from
links golf with its fairways tightly laced among woods and heathland is
a bargain at #34 for a day ticket.
Northwards and a call in to Carnoustie, a one-time Open Championship
venue and where Watson, Player, Hogan and Cotton have been victors. The
Championship course has a SS of 74 and is one of Scotland's toughest
tests of golf best suited to good players. A round over the Championship
course costs #40, but visitors may purchase a three-day ticket at #120,
or a five-day ticket at #180. This entitles them to a round each day
over the Championship course with a choice of play over the Burnside
Course or the Buddon Links.
The visiting golfer will soon realise that apart from the expensive to
the near-exclusive golf courses in Scotland there are hundreds more
where green fees are less costly and where the father and son
partnership can enjoy the game without breaking the bank.
In Scotland's north-east are many such courses, notably in Aberdeen
where Auchmill, Balnagask, Bon Accord and Hazlehead charge #6.10 for an
adult per round and #3.05 for juniors. Further along the coast good
value can be found Elgin, Forres, Fochabers with Nairn providing the
touch of class. The Championship course at Royal Dornoch is considered
by many to be the best golf course in Britain. Its testing links stretch
for 6581 yards, making a SS of 72. A round ticket costs #36 on weekdays
going up to #42 at the weekend.
Perthshire's most famous is almost exclusive to those staying at
Gleneagles Hotel, however, in this most scenic area of Scotland are many
alternatives. The Rosemount and Landsdowne courses at Blairgowrie have
been carved out of a forest and deer and grouse are regularly sited in
the course of a round. Green fees are #48 for a day ticket which permits
golf on both courses and use of the Wee Course, a neat 9-holer.
In Ayrshire an excellent group of municipal courses which include
Belleisle, Troon Darley and Lochgreen give affordable golf on fine
courses. Private clubs are in abundance offering links and parkland or a
mixture of both. Worth a visit are Brunston Castle, #20; Old Prestwick,
where The Open was first played and Royal Troon, where the open is to be
played in 1997.
Dumfries and Galloway also has an affordable range of courses and
Stranraer's Creachmore by Loch Ryan mixes links and parkland. The
eighteenth is named Braid's Last, being the last course James Braid
designed, a round ticket costs #16. Moving east, Kirkcudbright's hilly
parkland SS67 course looks down on the town with its many fine art
galleries; a round ticket costs #15. The lighthouse on the Solway marks
Southerness and its course has been the scene of many amateur
championships. The links course is a testing circuit and a day ticket
costs #24. Powfoot, east of Dumfries on the Solway is also worth a visit
and has a number of holes with links characteristics with the remainder
played as parkland; a day is ticket #24.
Golfing holidays in Scotland often come packaged and many hotels and
guest houses have all-inclusive deals that include green fees at
selected local courses. One idea that has established itself in The
Borders is Freedom of the Fairways where a passport is issued for either
three days or five days. The three-day passport costs #43 (under-17 #21)
and the five-day passport #66 (#34) and entitles holders to play a
maximum of 36 holes on any of the 16 participating courses.
Whether you choose Muirfield near Edinburgh or Haggs Castle in
Glasgow, the superb links at Machrihanish on the Mull of Kintyre or the
testing links of North Berwick or Turnberry, the Highlands, islands, or
lowlands, there's a course somewhere in Scotland that is just waiting to
become your favourite.

Scotland has sport for all, reports Rennie McOwan
IT'S an odd experience to be hauled before a court martial when on
holiday, but it happened on board a converted puffer, the VIC 32, on a
week's cruising holiday around the islands of Bute, Arran, the Cumbraes
and in lovely sea lochs.
The offender had been permitted to take the wheel for a short spell in
a safe section of water when he allowed his attention to wander. The
smoke from the funnel which had been blowing steadily to the side
suddenly changed direction as the boat veered and swept into the cabin
and covered the dining table with smuts.
The sentence was to wash up the dinner dishes. The other holiday
passengers in the crew ate Mars bars (awarded for sooking up to the
skipper) and smirked happily.
It was all good fun. For the uninitiated a puffer was a sea-going
''lorry'' and once supplied communities up and down the west coast. One
of the few remaining vessels is now a holiday boat and passengers can
open lock gates, polish brasses, take their turn at the wheel under
supervision, and shovel coal into the gaping and always hungry boiler.
If you want to loll around as well, then that's fine.
Scotland is a great place for action. With only five million of a
population and so much land where the hand of man is least evident there
is plenty of scope for walking, sailing, cycling, skiing in season, pony
trekking, shooting, canoeing, rafting, wind and wave surfing and
sub-aqua diving.
If you are a landlubber, then Scotland provides walking of all grades,
technical rock and ice climbing, long distance passes, short strolls,
gentle hills, impressive mountains. Nearly all tourism offices have
leaflets about local walks, about access and safety and there are
excellent guiding agencies run by people who know what they are about
and who are often multi-lingual.
If you prefer to be carried, but to do something, then why not try
pony trekking? It is a boom sport. It can suit the novice and also the
more experienced rider. There are horse riding courses for beginners and
trail riding for the more saddle-hardened.
There are over 60 approved centres offering such holidays. Some
centres have unaccompanied children's holidays where it is possible to
adopt a pony for a week.
One of the happiest sights of the Scottish outdoors in modern times
has been the rebirth and growth of the old cycling clubs. They were very
popular between the wars and just after the Second World War, and then
tended to dwindle in the face of the attractions of the car.
But the cyclists are on the road again in groups although the
sartorial gear of cap and near plus-fours has changed to T-shirts,
brightly coloured gear and crash helmets. There are many minor roads and
new cycle tracks and the Scottish Tourist Board -- as with many main
sports -- produces a helpful booklet for would-be cyclists with details
of 20 routes ranging from Ullapool to Lochinver and Scourie in the far
north west to the village of Ae, near Dumfries, surely one of the
shortest place names in Scotland. The booklet lists historic sites and
accommodation information.
Most people think of holidays as summer, but in Scotland there are
projects at other times of the year. From early winter into the spring,
growing numbers of people head each year for the ski centres at Glen
Coe, in Glen Shee, in the Cairngorms, at the Lecht and in the Nevis
Range. Any number of holiday permutations are available, including hire
of gear, instruction, accommodation and fees.
Conservation bodies also offer holiday projects where volunteer
workers can rebuild old drystane dikes, renovate footpaths, create
nature sanctuaries . . . and have a good social life as well.
Activity holidays do not always have to be bursting with energetic
pursuits. The universities offer holiday courses in Scottish history,
tracing ancestry, literature and many other subjects. Art and painting
classes are to be found and so are gardening courses.
There are many hotels and guest houses ideally suited for bird
watchers or geologists. And always, you can also slump and relax with
the holiday book of your choice. After all, that's a kind of activity as
well.
The Tourist Board offers free brochures on Ski Scotland, Cycling,,
Watersports Fun and Adventure Holidays, Trekking and Riding, and
Walking, from Board HQ at 23 Ravelston Terrace, Edinburgh EH4 3EU.

THE hotel receptionist was unamused. One of our group endeavoured to
impress her with a man-of-the-hills air and mentioned that on previous
mountaineering holidays he had stayed in bothies, open, unlocked
shelters hidden in the hills. She treated him with disdain thereafter.
It is true that a bothy is undoubtedly self-catering in that you buy,
carry-in and cook all your own food (and provide the stove), but you can
have a self-catering holiday in a castle or a mansion if you want to.
There's often a great atmosphere or character attached to such places.
In a shoreline, self-catering cottage in the lovely village of Diabeg
(pronounced je-ah-beg), in the Torridon area of the West Highlands, I
thought the wooden panelling had a familiar look.
It reminded me of one of these all purpose shops which were once such
a feature of the Highland scene and it slowly dawned on me that it had
indeed, once upon a time, been the village shop. The owners had the good
sense to keep the panelling and the front door opened in two sections.
Self-catering has a lot going for it. It is worth taking time to check
out such establishments in detail, including such items as bed linen and
a washing machine. The standard gets higher every year. It is very
relaxing for a couple, family or group to hire a cottage, chalet, lodge,
house, caravan or castle, mansion or university flat or suite and to do
one's own thing.
Many establishments have a phone, radio and TV set, but if you don't
want these then ignore them or cheer if they are not there. The crux of
self-catering is that it suits individual tastes.
It is fun, too, to sally out to local shops, to shop in a different
area, to get to know staff, to chat and swop anecdotes and pick up
useful items about local events or bus times or the weather. This last
point can sometimes be a conventional item and not much else. I've never
met a Highlander yet who would say with certainty that the weather would
be dry and warm, but would nevertheless indicate with great cordiality
that it might well be fine.
The Scottish Tourist Board produces an efficiently clear guide to
self-catering holidays and with instructions in French and German as
well as English. There are over 1200 places listed and facilities range
from four-poster beds to swimming pools, from baby sitting services to
access for disabled visitors.
Self-catering is a boom industry so the key is to book early and
particularly for July and August. It is not always realised that in
Scotland when a person accepts accommodation by telephone or in writing
a legally binding contract is being entered into which must be fulfilled
by both sides.
Failure to take up a booking might mean forfeiting any deposit already
paid, but can also mean paying compensation to the establishment if the
booking cannot be re-let. This might sound severe, but it is a fair
system to all. In any event, the atmosphere surrounding seeking and
getting bookings is generally a happy one all round.
The universities can be a boon for families during holiday time with
cheap, ideally sited flats. When my own family was younger we took off
for St Andrews where leisure lectures on every subject under the sun
could be attended, student monitors looked after young children and
deserved campaign ribbons, or if you didn't want to attend a lecture
(and the choice was yours) the beach or shore or shops beckoned.
Some owners make a point of welcoming children and pets (to some
families there is no difference): a few object to dogs and babies. In
most cases the attitude is one of warmth and enthusiasm and a desire
that you have a happy time.
So pick your caravan, flat, wooden chalet, pinewood cabin, ancient
(but modernised inside) cottage, converted barn, castle or mansion ...
and do your own thing. And just to ensure you eat properly, the Tourist
Board book gives an outline of mouth-watering Scottish food in
collaboration with the Taste of Scotland scheme and both are happy to
provide details.

EDINBURGH is experiencing a squeeze on office and industrial
development space and shop rents in prime locations such as Princes
Street are rising, property consultants Ryden said in their latest
Scottish Industrial and Commercial Property Review.
''The city looks likely to face a critical shortage of quality
open-plan space, both within the city centre and on the periphery, by
1996,'' the report said.
Ryden said about 38% of the 1.58 million square feet (147,000 square
metres) of available office space in Edinburgh consisted of old
buildings on the fringes of the New Town, which were unlikely to be used
again as offices.
''People have moved from these town house buildings into open-plan
space and therefore there is less need for this type of accommodation,''
said Ryden senior partner Fiona Martin.
She said companies began moving out of these downtown buildings, which
were originally designed as dwelling houses, about five years ago when
new property developments on the outskirts of Edinburgh became
available.
The Ryden survey also highlighted a chronic shortage of industrial
sites in Edinburgh, which was diverting new investment to enterprise
areas elsewhere in central and eastern Scotland.
''The lack of new space is clearly a result of stagnant rental values
over the last few years, combined with high land values in prime
locations such as West Edinburgh, which make unsubsidised speculative
developments very marginal indeed,'' the Ryden survey said.
Ryden reported a brisker turnover in office space in Glasgow over the
last six months. The take-up of available space was mainly in new and
refurbished buildings and this was matched by a stream of older
properties coming back on the market, it said.
A forseeable shortage of new properties in Glasgow over the next year
was prompting some developers to bring forward schemes which could
provide a further 600,000 square feet (56,000 square metres) of
refurbished space in and around the city centre, it said.
But Ryden said that there was no sign of institutions rushing headlong
into speculative development anywhere in Scotland and banks remained
reluctant to lend after their experience in the early 1990's.
''Rents appear to have bottomed out in all sectors of the market,
although there appears to be greater recovery potential in the office
sector,'' the report said.

Andrew Douglas goes on an innovative tour of a distillery
THE whisky industry in Scotland is a leading exporter, worth more than
#2bn, and its significance is of great importance to the economy of many
communities. In Moray alone there are more than 40 distilleries, the
greatest amount anywhere in Scotland.
Malt whiskies would be classified by experts as falling into one of
four categories: Highland, Lowland, Islay and Campbeltown. However, this
in turn could be more simply defined as Speyside or from the west and
islands. Malt whisky from the west has a distinct peaty flavour.
Visitors to Scotland and to the Speyside area in particular should not
miss out on a visit to one of the distilleries. A typical tour will
include an audio visual presentation outlining the company's history and
how the brand has been developed. A sampling of the nectar will follow
the tour and offer time for contemplation.
But to the whisky trail and Keith, which is indeed the gateway. In
this ancient Scottish town is one of the country's most beautiful
distilleries and one of the oldest operating distilleries in the
Highlands, Strathisla.
As part of the parent company's heritage programme, a new visitor
centre is opening at the end of May where self-guided tours, an
innovation to the Scotch whisky industry, will allow visitors to view
Strathisla on their own. This permits the individual to focus on areas
of particular interest to themselves.
Visitors will be seen as ''guests'' with staff on hand at every stage
to explain the processes, including the skills and traditions involved
in the whisky-making process. In the working distillery, visitors will
be able to follow the fascinating process of whisky production through
its various stages: milling, fermentation, distilling, filling and
maturation.
At the heart of the distillery is the still room where the traditional
copper stills and spirit safe go about their business in an air of quiet
determination.
Strathisla dates from 1785 but before this there was a brewery on the
site as early as the thirteenth century operated by Dominican monks. The
distillery is supplied by water -- which many believe to be the key to
its taste -- from a locally revered spring, the Fons Bulliens.
Whisky has formed a major role in Scotland's commercial history and
its importance as a provider of employment past and present is clearly
documented in such distillery tours. And just as each whisky has its
individual character, so too do the distilleries from which they are
created.
A sampling of the nectar will follow the tour and offer time for
contemplation

SCOTLAND has always been renowned for glorious scenery, fine food and
drink, and the warmth, generosity and humour of its people. Add to that
a superb range of accommodation and you have the ingredients for the
holiday of a lifetime.
If you have already heard of Scotland's Commended, you will know that
it is a prestigious collection of independently owned and managed
country and town house hotels throughout Scotland.
Located amid some of Scotland's best scenery and places of interest,
each of its 67 member establishments offer the highest standards of
accommodation, cuisine and service. Most are in rural locations or in
the outskirts of towns, but some surprises are tucked away in cities.
You will find hotels in areas from Lairg to Forres, Skye to Arran,
Grantown to Pitlochry, Invergarry to Glasgow, Aberfeldy to Edinburgh and
from Stewarton to Selkirk.
Most of the hotels are members of Taste of Scotland -- recognised as
the authentic voice of all that is best in food in Scotland. Others have
attained AA Rosettes in recognition of not only the high quality of food
and service which they offer, but also their knowledge of wines and
their service. All hotels offer a warm and friendly atmosphere and a
genuine commitment to customer care.
Scotland's Commended bases itself on the Scottish Tourist Board's
grading and classification scheme which has been in operation since
1985. STB inspectors assess all the important factors that contribute to
the comfort of your accommodation and highlight the range of facilities
and services offered.
To be accepted as a member of Scotland's Commended, hotels must attain
a minimum of commended four crowns, or highly commended three crowns
(some members are four crowns deluxe) so you can be confident that
choosing to stay at a Scotland's Commended hotel will be a pleasure.
Each property is original and individual in character, some reflecting
the quiet elegance of a more leisured, bygone age. There is a wide
choice to suit most tastes and pockets.
The extent of Scotland's natural store cupboard is little known
outside the country, but now, thanks to our enterprising -- and often
award-winning -- chefs, you can enjoy the very best the land and sea has
to offer. Our climate and landscape provide ideal conditions for a huge
variety of quality food products, and the dining rooms of our hotels
combine traditional dishes with the finest of modern cuisine, ensuring
that the food in a Scotland's Commended hotel is to be savoured.
The hotels still revere the tradition of that great gastronomic treat
-- a full Scottish breakfast. Why not start the day with porridge and
kippers or smoked haddock, fresh eggs, black pudding, lightly smoked
bacon, potato scones, and thick homemade oatcakes with heather honey?
You may not be able to move for a while, but there is no finer way to
start a day of first-class eating.
Scotland is a country of infinite variety. Friendly and welcoming, it
is an interesting and colourful all-season destination, where scenery
and environment, sport and leisure pursuits, heritage and history,
culture and cuisine are all part of an enriching experience. Stunningly
beautiful -- particularly in fine weather -- the Scottish countryside
can look at its best from September to Christmas when stags roam among
the purple heather on the hills and our mild Scottish autumn turns
leaves to incredible hues of red and bronze.
To enjoy Scotland to the full, you must enjoy being outdoors, and not
just in fine weather. If you want to indulge your favourite active
pastime, whether it's walking (the most popular pastime in the UK),
golfing, fishing, cycling or bird-watching, Scotland's extraordinary
wealth of scenery will add an extra dimension.
Many Scotland's Commended hotels have their own sports facilities, or
will be organise leisure pursuits for you. Why not enjoy a game of golf
on the finest and most natural links courses in the world. Or try more
or less active pursuits -- canoeing, croquet, white water rafting, clay
pigeon shooting, Munro-bagging and mountain biking, to name but a few.
For those of you who enjoy the gentler things in life Scotland is, of
course, famous for its historic castles, museums, galleries and visitor
centres, many of which stay open during the winter months. In June,
however, when the days are so long that you can finish your dinner at
11pm and find it's still light outside. Scotland's gardens are a
delight, with peonies, roses and honeysuckle in full flower. There is
also a tremendous breadth and diversity of arts and culture, combining
the traditions that have made Scotland distinct with the styles and
ideas of the modern world.
If you are seeking a romantic hideaway, why not enjoy a weekend break
in the hills. You could work up an appetite with a long country walk,
fortified by the prospect of lounging in front of a roaring log fire
with a dram (or two) in the evening. Indulge yourself with fine cuisine
in delightful surroundings -- all with the host's personal touch -- and
then luxuriate into a comfort and elegance of a four-poster bed. If all
this sounds like bliss, then Scotland's Commended is for you.
Whisky is renowned world-wide. Connoisseurs of Scotland's national
drink can visit malt whisky distilleries in many parts of the Highlands
and a few places in the Lowlands and islands as well and witness where
all the magic happens. Some of members boast an extensive collection of
malt whiskies and will be delighted to introduce you to some you have
perhaps not sampled.
Members can help plan your itinerary, or make an onward booking at
another member hotel. A #10 voucher*, redeemable against your next stay
(at standard rates) at a member hotel is available from hotel reception
desks. Most hotels are open all year and offer special off-peak deals.
If you would like a copy of the 1995 brochure containing full details of
its 67 members, please write to the Administration Office, Scotland's
Commended, 33 Craiglockhart Drive South, Edinburgh EH14 1JA.
No matter what time of year you choose to come, you will be made
welcome by the hospitality that has become part of the tradition of a
holiday in Scotland.
*This voucher cannot be used in conjunction with this -- or any other
-- promotion.

Rennie McOwan finds he need never walk alone
THE rambler in a formal sense is a fairly new type of outdoor person
in Scotland and is on the increase as the Ramblers Association grows in
size and influence.
People always strolled around in a relaxed fashion and took short
country walks or went for longer treks, but did not classify themselves
as mountaineers and not even as hillwalkers.
Rambling has a more general and pastoral image which is not always
accurate. It must be emphasised that a person who hillwalks all year in
Scotland is not a rambler, but a mountaineer with knowledge of snow and
weather conditions and the possession of an ice-axe and crampons and an
ability to use them and to navigate are all essential elements.
But there is a broad church of people between the short stroll after
dinner brigade (and nothing wrong with that) and the all-year
mountaineer who loves to walk and glory in the countryside, who is often
knowledgeable about birds, flowers or geology and who wants to learn
about such subjects, and who likes walking in a group with a leader.
Having said that, there is nothing to stop any ramblers going as a
twosome or, with care, on one's own. It is always a puzzle that lone
yachtsmen are knighted and lone walkers get criticised.
There are many advantages in joining a ramblers group. There is
normally a set programme of events throughout the year and a leader who
is responsible for the planning and solving access problems in advance
and who can be the recipient of brickbats or bouquets depending on how
the day turns out.
There are quite often permutations of different length so that the
walker has a choice between a demanding and a more sedentary route.
There is an opportunity to meet other people and, in my experience,
ramblers are generally very nice company.
The idea of group walking is not everyone's cup of tea, but it has a
lot to commend it for newcomers anxious to get into the walking arena
and who might be uneasy about venturing too far and unsure about what
gear to buy and what to do.
Rambling groups often walk the passes or go to historic sites and tend
to concentrate on better known hills and routes.
The hillwalker and mountaineer has no difficulty in finding a
collective entity: clubs for them abound all over the place.
The rambling groups and individuals, often unclassified and often
unorganised and sometimes touching on the world of the mountaineer and
all-year hillwalker, have now evolved into a formal and growing
organisation in Scotland, the Ramblers Association.
Under its energetic Scottish director, Dave Morris, it has a
responsible high profile on the access issue and a good thing, too.
Outdoor people need to flex their muscles on this issue from time to
time.
The RA is also culturally sound in Scotland, producing materials in
Gaelic as well as English, although it occasionally has to remind London
HQ that Britain does not end at Watford or Carlisle.
If you fancy this walking lark -- and you have a lifetime of enjoyment
ahead of you if you do -- then think about joining up with a ramblers'
group. The RA headquarters at Crusader House, Haig Business Park,
Markinch, Fife, will gladly supply details.
It is a very relaxed walking world we enjoy in Scotland. You can have
just as much or as little organisation as you seek for your own needs.
After all, going to the outdoors is about exercising a responsible
freedom. It means co-existing with the reasonable needs of farms and
estates and understanding wild life in all its forms. Learning about
such things is one of the pleasures.
It also means experiencing the joys of the Scottish outdoors and in
many cases contributing essential revenue to local communities through
buying food and drink, petrol, other goods, and accommodation. Happy
rambling.

THE rain in Scotland fell mainly on the Spaniards. At least, that is
what it must have seemed like to a contingent of 300 Spanish soldiers
who are commemorated in one of our most interesting hill names, Sgurr
nan Spainteach, the peak-of-the-Spaniards, in Kintail, in the Western
Highlands.
After a disciplined and controlled performance at the Battle of Glen
Shiel in 1719 they decided to surrender because ''they could not live in
such a wild country''.
You can see the battle site for yourself. There is a little cairn near
a nook of the old road in one of the most striking sections of the
modern A87 road as it leaves Glen Cluanie and heads north-west for Shile
Bridge and Loch Duich.
On one side is the long line of the undulating Cluanie Ridge, much
beloved of mountaineers because it contains so many Munro mountains
(hills over 3000ft which are ''bagged'' as a kind of mountaineering
virility symbol and first catalogued by mountaineer Sir Hugh T. Munro)
and on the other side are the steep slopes of the Five Sisters of
Kintail.
The Five Sisters commemorate lovelorn daughters who waited in vain for
Norse lovers to come, and such was their will that when their princes
did not appear they were eventually turned into stone. As a cynical
friend of mine remarked: ''It shows the difference between the women
then and now.''
Just ahead lies the sharp peak of Faochag, which unromantically
translates as The Whelk, and which appears in so many postcards and
calendars.
It was in this beautiful corner that the Spaniards joined some of the
Scottish clans in one of the least publicised Jacobite campaigns to set
the exiled Stuarts back on the throne of Britain. An internationally
planned scheme included a rising by English Jacobites and Spanish troops
landing in England as well, but this did not happen.
The Mackenzie stronghold of Eilean Donan Castle, in Loch Duich, and
not far from Glen Shiel, was bombarded by ships and when news of these
disasters spread many of the Jacobite clansmen stayed at home. Others
fought a short-lived engagement on June 10 in Glen Shiel with Government
troops, the heather was set on fire by mortars, and the Jacobites
eventually withdrew.
But the memory of the Spaniards, landed to help an exiled Stuart
monarch and virtually abandoned, lives on in the Gaelic language hill
name.
On the fringe of Stirling, at the west end of the Ochils and close to
the cathedral city of Dunblane (yes, Dunblane is technically a city
despite its small size) and not far from the old spa town of Bridge of
Allan where the youthful Robert Louis Stevenson spent holidays, is the
Battlefield of Sheriffmuir.
It was an untidy engagement with both sides claiming victory in 1715,
but it was a win on points for the Hanoverian forces because they
stopped the Jacobite momentum and the 1715 rising also fizzed out.
As the visitor drives from Dunblane to the old drovers inn at
Sheriffmuir, keep an eye out for a large memorial at the side of the
road. It was erected by the Clan MacRae Society and commemorates MacRaes
who fell at Sheriffmuir when fighting on the Jacobite side. They had a
vow that they would never leave a battlefield while their banner still
flew and two companies of them fell almost to a man.
There is one battlefield which cannot be missed this year and next. It
is Culloden or Drumossie Muir, near Inverness, where on April 16, 1746,
Prince Charles Edward Stuart's Jacobite army suffered a crushing defeat
at the hands of the Duke of Cumberland's Hanoverian and Government
forces.
Culloden changed the course of Scottish and British history. It is
often portrayed as a Scottish-English fight, but there were Scots on
both sides although it is true that the Jacobites (from the Latin
Jacobus, for James, the exiled claimants to the throne) wanted to repeal
the Treaty of Union of 1707 between Scotland and England.
Culloden is a near-shrine for many people as well as a battlefield.
The prince's army was without its most able military commander, Lord
George Murray, who resigned after a row with the prince and his
advisers.
The clans were forced to stand on the moor while the cannonballs and
grapeshot poured into them until the maddened, tired and hungry men
hurled themselves at the enemy's lines. They broke the first line and
many died on the bayonets of the second. Accurate musketry and cannon
fire tore great gaps in the ranks of the charging men.
With different generalship, the disaster could have been avoided and
the battle fought elsewhere in more favourable terrain.
The 1745 rising petered out, the prince went into exile, the
Hanoverian government cracked down on the Highlands, the pipes, weapons
and tartan were forbidden, the wounded were killed, many prisoners were
transported overseas and reprisals were taken against the civilian
population.
The social character of the Highlands changed and later clearances
sent thousands of people overseas. It was the end of an auld sang.
The National Trust for Scotland looks after Culloden in a sensitive
fashion. There is a visitor centre, but the moorland is much as it was.
Simple stones bear the names of the clans. It is a poignant place with
power to make people weep to this day.
Another ''must'' is an earlier battle of major importance. It doesn't
look much because the field of Bannockburn, where the Scots defeated the
invading English in 1314, is nowadays mainly covered with houses, but
King Robert the Bruce's command post is now the site of a huge
equestrian statue of the king. The National Trust for Scotland's visitor
centre has a good audio-visual show about the Scottish Wars of
Independence.
Have a look at the banners. Among other things, the checked heraldry
of the Stuarts gave us the modern words cheque and Exchequer and the
diced pattern in police officer's hats. The Trust's display of Scottish
history is one of the clearest of its kind. There are life-size models
and you can try on an armoured helmet, if you want to feel what it was
like long ago.
Culloden is a near-shrine for many people -- it is a poignant place
with power to make people weep to this day

Beautiful sites by the seaside or in the country greet Andrew Douglas
on a tour of Scotland
HOLIDAYS in caravans are enjoyed by more than 13 million people in
Britain each year and visitors to Scotland are finding the appeal of a
camping or caravanning vacation, indeed recent statistics revealed that
60 million nights are spent in caravans alone. The Camping and
Caravanning Club reports that the number of holidaymakers of all ages
taking to the great outdoors has shown a consistent increase in recent
years.
Such holidays give a unique flexibility and freedom while offering the
benefits of the country or seaside air. Children in particular love the
adventure aspects and parents find more time for relaxation which can be
difficult with boisterous children in a hotel. Most people who choose to
camp do so because they want to have a holiday or short break in an
atmosphere that is away from the routine of their normal day.
Scotland has a huge choice of sites and locations. And whether you are
looking to really get away from it all or to combine your holiday with
leisure pursuits such as rambling, boating, angling or golf there is a
campsite that will be near to where you can pursue your interest.
The Camping and Caravanning Club run a number of sites in Scotland.
Most are open to non-members and are well-run peaceful sites ideal for
family camping. Common to nearly all of them are toilets and showers,
laundry and facilities for disabled people.
The club has 15 campsites in Scotland covering most areas, so whether
your fancy is Jedburgh or Inverewe, Culzean Castle or Craigellachie you
can be sure of a high standard of accommodation.
Perhaps your fancy may be the Mull of Kintyre where there is an
abundance of wildlife and a seabird observatory to enthral nature
lovers. A championship golf course at Machrihanish, coarse fishing and
country walks amid pleasant landscapes all add to the attraction of the
area.
At Speyside winter landscaping work has removed unsightly rubble and
24 new electric hook-ups have been installed on the site which now has
75 pitches. In the course of continuing improvement the site at
Inverewe, the club's most northerly in Scotland, has had the existing
facility block extended. Landscaping has created 60 pitches. And at
Moffat, the opening of a reception building with facilities for disabled
people will enhance the site's appeal.
Perhaps all will be contenders for the 1995 best site award which was
won last year by Oban.
Most parks are easily accessible off the main tourist routes and are
well signposted, but booking in advance is a good idea at peak holiday
times -- especially if you think traffic could delay your arrival. Keep
your stress management under control by allowing extra time to get
there, especially when travelling during the summer months.
If a holiday under canvas is your preference there are tents to suit
all requirements and budgets. Tents today are highly sophisticated
structures and do not require a building certificate to put them up.
They are easy to erect, secure and convenient and offer a degree of
comfort that a few years ago may have been hard to imagine.
Furniture and furnishings have also improved and beds, tables, chairs,
cooking equipment, and accessories both practical and luxurious have
been designed to make tent camping more comfortable.
The same applies to the modern touring caravan which provides an even
greater degree of luxury. Designed to make maximum use of available
space, the modern caravan incorporates gadgets and equipment to provide
all home comforts. Most campsites have mains electricity for caravan
users and on arrival it's a simple case of hooking up to the supply.
For those starting out, the major expenditure is of course the caravan
or the family tent but even this can be cost-effective with good
condition second-hand family caravans available for around #3500 or a
new family tent with compartments for #600.
Camping and caravanning holidays offer so much fun for all the family
-- the family that plays together stays together. Once you have acquired
your equipment it is there to be used as many times as you wish, long
weekends or leisurely fortnights, giving you one of the cheapest
holidays available, next to visiting your relatives.

SPARE a thought for John Damien. His job must have been under threat
(as we would say nowadays) or he felt he was no longer politically
correct or his girlfriend was on the verge of ditching him or perhaps
all three.
He felt he had to do something spectacular so he constructed home-made
wings and dived off the battlements of Stirling Castle one well
remembered day in 1507 and in front of King James IV and his court and
sundry spectators and hit the ground an awful smack.
John Damien broke his leg, but his reputation was not shattered
because the king was so impressed by his courage that he took him back
into his favoured circle.
Scotland is rich in great houses and castles and a seemingly endless
parade of kings, queens, courtiers, warriors, ambassadors, church
leaders, musicians, artists, poets, writers and architects pass along
their battlements and through their halls. Their dungeons and key gates
ring with tales of gallantry and cruelties.
James II was born at Stirling and Mary Queen of Scots and James VI
lived there. James IV -- who was to die so tragically at the Battle of
Flodden -- left his builder's mark on the old fort and James V used to
sneak out of the castle dressed as a minor laird, the Gudeman of
Ballengeich, and chat up the local girls. This jewel-casket of a castle
contains many precious gems and one of these is the museum of the famous
regiment, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, with relics ranging
from splendid Mess silver to heart-rending mementoes from battlefields
and prison camps.
Edinburgh Castle is, of course, the best known in Scotland and its
famous, floodlit, military tattoo, part of the international Edinburgh
Festival, sends echoes throughout the ancient capital city which once
had a more grim ring, the tuck of drum, the sound of the pipes and the
steady beat of marching feet.
A revamped exhibition project in the castle should not be missed. It
is the Honours of Scotland, the oldest Crown jewels in Europe (much
older than the British crown jewels) which were hidden from Cromwell's
army in Scotland because they were a symbol of nationhood as well as
ceremonial possessions of the royal family. They lay buried in a church
for many years before being returned to the castle.
But it is not only the great castles that deserve attention, such as
the mainly eighteenth-century Culzean Castle, a creation of the famous
architect, Robert Adam, and one of the glories of Ayrshire, nor the
sprawling fortifications of Urquhart Castle, on the shores of Loch Ness,
in the Great Glen, gifted by James IV to the Grants, nor Eilean Donan
castle in Kintail, in the north west, which is so picturesque that it is
used in films and nicknamed ''Castle Shortbread'' because it appears on
so many labels, although all of these are joys.
Scotland is peppered with smaller castles, tower hosues and mansions
which merit time to browse and examine.
My own favourites include Caerlaverock Castle, seat of the Maxwell
family, and sited not far from Dumfries. Its two, great round towers and
prominent moat make it look much as a castle should and photographers
love it.
The single tower house of Craigievar, in the north east, one of the
Castles of Mar, now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland,
stands virtually today as the builders left it in 1626. The joy of
Craigievar, set amid woods and parkland, is that it links the world of
defensive fort with a new world of gracious living: the plaster
ceilings, carved panelling and furnishings make it one of Scotland's
best-loved castles.
Picking favourite forts is a subjective pursuit and all of these
mentioned here are no more than tasters before a great banquet. Castle
Campbell, at Dollar, at the foot of the Ochils, is another child-of-war
which looks just like a castle should. It was the Lowland home of great
Clan Campbell and at one time was known as Castle Gloom. It is perched
on a mound and bordered by deep cut glens and it, too, has featured in
films. It is not large in size, but full of character. So is Neidpath
Castle, near Peebles, which smacks of Border raids, alarms and calls to
arms.
But big or small, Scotland is certainly a castles country.

EVEN Scarlett O'Hara would have found it both tiring on the feet and
wonderful. The red Georgia dust swirled up and the outline of pipe bands
marching in formation came through the swirling curtain.
The drums thudded, the pipes sang the old tunes which had been heard
in Highland glens for years and which now echoed off the rocks of Stone
Mountain, once a sacred mountain to the Indians and now part of a United
States national park.
The pipes did not skirl, one of the most wrongly used words in the
English language. A skirl is a false note. The pipers played well
because these American-Scots drawn from all over the country, took a
pride in being proficient.
More than 30,000 people watched the Stone Mountain Highland Games and
related events. The dancing, piping and the trials of strength were
impressive and although all kinds of acts of sacrilege were committed on
the national dress the grand march of the clan societies was a parade to
touch the heart.
Yes, there were blemishes. Too many folk only thought of Scotland as a
colourful relic from the past, too many liked the idea of hob-nobbing
with ''chiefs'' from the British aristocracy some of whom have a near
irrelevant role in modern Scotland. Southern hospitality is truly
wonderful, but you need a strong constitution.
Many of these people were heading for Scotland the next summer and as
the city of Atlanta and its surrounding district has as many people as
the whole of Scotland and as our land could be lost within a corner of
many American states, I began to wonder why and to seek answers.
Why does this small country of ours with its uncertain weather attract
so many visitors? Blood links with Scotland is certainly part of it, but
it is more than that.
The poet Hugh MacDiarmid asked how anyone could call Scotland small,
''our infinite Scotland, small?'' He then went on to reflect on all the
joys of an apparently empty hillside, the flowers, the scents, the
sounds of the outdoors, all intermingling and working a kind of alchemy
on people.
There is a great variety in Scottish scenery and changing light brings
many subtle changes in colour so that no view is dull and static.
It is no accident that the design of tartan is so intricate. It might
have been broad bands of what an unintentional humorist called
''naething gaudy, jist plain rid and yella'' or all one colour, but it
is not.
It reflects the changing colours of the landscape as the seasons and
the weather changes. It reflects the richnesses and complexities of the
scenery.
Here are no barren deserts or snowy wastes, but a landscape which has
known the hand of man and yet which can truly be said to be ''wild'' in
many areas and which tells of many races and peoples who have left their
mark, their memories and a near psychic impression of their joys and
sorrows upon it. There are layers of history.
The visitor can drive right across Scotland in one day and the whole
length of the country in one day. Scotland is not big. It can sometimes
look austere. One visitor having spent a week hitching around and
talking to people told me: ''Scotland is grey granite . . . with a fire
inside''.
In a matter of hours a visitor can drive from the rich farmland of the
Borders with its grassy hills, forests, a manicured and pastoral
landscape, with memories of reivers and where ancient abbeys stand
beside salmon-rich rivers and pass to Galloway, the Highlands in
miniature, where harsher hills have memories of the fugitive King Robert
the Bruce and in neighbouring lands small coastal villages have long
pedigrees of seafaring deeds.
Ayrshire has its memories of the poet Robert Burns and offshore the
island of Arran is a popular holiday place.
A short time later and the farms, cities and towns of the developed
central belt are reached. If you want castles, try royal Edinburgh where
the visitor on the battlements can look down on a designer-made
nineteenth-century city flanked by an older heart or visit the Palace of
Holyrood House with its memories of the tragic Mary Queen of Scots or
the great museums and galleries.
Stirling, too, has its castle and its royal memories and was once
described as the brooch which clasped Highland and Lowland together.
Amid the factories and the urban houses are many a historic site and
Glasgow, Scotland's biggest city and third in Britain, has battled hard
in recent years to build up a tourist image and its Burrell Collection
is among the best galleries and museums in Europe.
Glasgow has more parkland than any other city in Britain and although
all Scottish cities suffer in some degree from the same problems as most
big cities (drugs, poor housing, crime) there is a generosity among
Glasgow people which is most marked. Any charitable cause will get a
response from Glasgow folk. Edinburgh people are generous as well: they
just find it harder. There is, of course, a rivalry with Edinburgh
because Glasgow is big and industrial and Edinburgh is smaller and arty,
but has capital status. Incidentally, most of the big museums and
galleries in Scotland are free.
The ancient kingdom of Fife has its charming harbour-villages which
once saw much trade with the Baltic and the Low Countries and where
pantiled houses, with crow-step gables and little, sheltered neuks
attract artists and where the ancient -- but small -- city of St Andrews
is a Mecca for golfers.
Push on north, either by way of the River Forth's majestic bridges or
by Stirling, and the vast area of the Highlands opens up, glens,
straths, mountains, hills in profusion, providing good walking and many
an attraction for bird watchers, botanists, geologists or those who like
peace and quiet.
There are battlefields like Culloden, near Inverness, where the
Jacobite cause, the struggle to put the Stuarts back on the throne of
Britain, came to an end in 1746 and after which the history of the
Highlands changed.
There are some great houses like Scone Palace, near Perth, where
Scottish kings were crowned and where the Stone of Destiny was housed .
. . small houses of great charm like Barrie's birthplace in the village
of Kirriemuir, in Angus, on the fringe of the Highlands, where you can
see the wash house which was an early theatre for J M Barrie who gave us
''Peter Pan''. . . there are evocative monuments such as at Glen Finnan,
to the west of Fort William, where the Jacobites and Prince Charles
Edward Stuart raised their standard in 1745. The figure on top of the
column is not the Prince, but -- deservedly -- one of the many loyal,
brave and tenacious clansmen who followed him.
There are great gardens such as the one at Inverewe, near Gairloch, in
the north west, now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland, and
which has plants from many lands . . . there are small museums of
quality such as the Heritage Museum in Gairloch where by pressing
buttons you can hear ancient Gaelic songs and see milling techniques
over the years. There are industrial, agricultural and fishing museums
in different parts of Scotland: try the Royal Research Ship
''Discovery'' in Dundee, Captain Scott's famous Antarctic exploration
vessel. Attractive cities like Aberdeen, with good shops and
restaurants, are excellent centres for touring, including the splendid
Castles of Mar.
The rich farmland and long glens of Angus have a special charm and no
person can easily exhaust the attractions of towns like Inverness,
capital of the Highlands, and their surrounding areas of lochs and
glens.
There are major puzzles like the Loch Ness monster (yes, something of
an animate nature does exist) and tiny, grisly memorials like the Well
of the Heads, in the Great Glen, which commemorates the near-mystic
washing of severed heads after a clans fight.
Further north, the Sutherland hills poke up from a more bleak
landscape which has an often harsh and sweeping grandeur and beyond this
''south land'' of the raiding Norsemen who eventually settled and went
native there is the wide plain of Caithness, of small grey villages,
stone-flagged ''walls'' instead of fences, backed by a wall of mountains
and with big skies and flanked by crashing seas, the ''cat land'' of the
vanished peoples of the past.
All of this can be driven across and up-and-down in one day or two.
Add to that the attractions of the Isles, of the Outer and Inner
Hebrides, of sea which sparkles in sun in glorious colours of turquoise,
blue, emerald and of the low-lying, northern Orkney islands with their
rich farms and standing stones and brochs and of Shetland with its Norse
''face'' and hospitable people.
How can anyone call Scotland small?
Some humour and patience is needed. The comedian Bob Hope said that in
Scotland you could experience four seasons in the one day and that is
true. The tiny insect, the midgie, can be an irritant, but sprays and
lotions are effective. If you are unlucky with weather, then there are
galleries, shops, museums and ''trails'' taking you to whisky
distilleries, tweed and woollens shops and factories and mills.
If you want to walk and explore, just check at the local tourism
office. There are any number of guide books and walks leaflets. If you
want to take a boat trip and watch seals or visit isolated islands then
study notice boards in towns and in hotels.
If you want to attend Highland Games then you will have plenty of
choice throughout the late spring, summer and early autumn. My own
favourites are the small, intimate Gathering at Glen Finnan and the
march of the pipe bands at the Cowal Gathering, in Argyll. I tell you,
it is larger than Stone Mountain, Georgia, as indeed it should be.
If you fancy doing some reading when you are here, then you will
rejoice in a series of new visitor centres, monuments and well-known
houses. In the Burns country, you can visit the poet's birthplace and go
on expeditions including to the haunted Kirk, which figured in the epic
tale ''Tam o' Shanter''. The designer-village of Inveraray, in Argyll,
was the birthplace of author Neil Munro: a Munro festival is being
planned for next spring. There are good walks and Inveraray Castle is a
''must''.
Caithness has a Neil Gunn centre at Dunbeath, a brilliant writer whose
star is rising again and who wrote a novel about a totalitarian state,
The Green Isle of the Great Deep, long before George Orwell wrote
Nineteen Eighty Four and whose best known book, The Silver Darlings is a
near classic.
Don't miss the Sir Walter Scott country of the Eildon hills, near
Melrose, and his home at Abbotsford, filled with memorabilia. Sir Walter
could be very snobby and class conscious, but he has a major place in
world literature. There is a new visitor centre in the Mearns to Lewis
Grassic Gibbon who gave us that marvellous book, A Scots Quair, and
whose writings are now standard texts in Scottish schools.
There is a John Buchan museum at Broughton, not far from Peebles, in
the Borders country which will tell you where the real 39 Steps were
sited. A centre devoted to the life of writer James Hogg has been opened
at Aikwood Tower, near Selkirk, the home of Sir David and Lady Steel.
And if that is not enough, you can visit Dunkeld and Birnam, just off
the A9, in Perthshire, and see for yourself what a historical hash
Shakespeare made of MacBeth.
When you look at the waters of the River Tay and the woods and hills
of Dunkeld and Birnam spare a thought for the much loved writings of
Beatrix Potter: she spent holidays there and the countryside gave her
many of her ideas. A Beatrix Potter garden with model animals and the
flavour of her writings has been created. It is also very good walking
country.
Scotland gets into your heart. It is never dull. It is never flat. It
is never simple. Its people are hardworking (when they get a chance) and
friendly, love an argument, tend to believe passionately in causes with
few half measures or grey areas. The climate, the texture of the
landscape and its history all add up to a small land which has produced
many inventors, explorers and pioneers. It is also a land which has a
European and international outlook.
There are countries with more spectacular scenery, warmer and more
constant weather, bigger castles and cathedrals, more colourful and
larger fiestas, but few which have so much quality and variety packed
into such a small space.
It is no surprise that Scottish exiles and their descendants cannot
forget it. Scotland and its landscape and history can sometimes be hard,
harsh, unforgiving, but it gets into the heart and soul.
Sir Walter Scott wrote: ''Breathes there a man with soul so dead who
never to himself hath said 'this is my own, my native land'.'' Yet its
peoples are forged from many races.
The discerning visitor can see it like that as well. Nuggets can be
sensed within the whole, facets of a highly intricate jewel.
There are dangers in coming to Scotland. It can get a grip on you,
particularly if you take time to browse.
If you have missed some key castle, great house, mountain, island,
garden, monument or event . . . well, you'll just have to come back.
You won't regret it.

A PERTH Prison inmate was given unprescribed injections of a
tranquilliser two days before his death, a fatal accident inquiry was
told yesterday.
The injections were given by a nursing officer without authorisation
by a doctor, but the inquiry at Perth Sheriff Court was told they had no
significance in relation to Mark Jeffrey's subsequent death.
Jeffrey, 21, of McCallum Court, Perth, died from hepatitis and liver
failure on December 25 last year while serving eight years for robbery.
Dr William Shennan, 40, said Jeffrey was admitted to the prison
hospital on December 23 apparently suffering from hepatitis. He said he
sent blood samples to Perth Royal Infirmary but received only part of
the results that day. He later learned the missing results revealed
gross abnormality.
The doctor said he was off-duty overnight and later learned that the
treatment he prescribed for Jeffrey had been altered. Nurse officer
Jacqueline Henderson had given him two injections of chlorpromazine.
Dr Shennan said that he had not authorised its use and would not have
done so if asked.
Dr Allan Shepherd, 44, a consultant at the infirmary, was asked if the
injections would affect Jeffrey's condition. He replied: ''There is no
evidence that they changed the course of his illness in any way.''
Nurse Henderson, 31, said that Jeffrey was vomiting when she went on
night shift on December 23. She said a drug prescribed by Dr Shennan to
control his condition was not available and on the advice of a senior
nurse she twice gave him chlorpromazine.
The inquiry continues today.

THE Edinburgh-based Scottish Building Society yesterday revealed that
only two of its 3000 mortgage accounts were in ''intensive care'' with
monthly repayments, as it announced a marginal increase in annual
after-tax profits to #1.06m.
However, chief executive William Munro said he shared the widespread
dismay about the impact on the most vulnerable borrowers of the proposed
curtailment, from October 1, of income support for those who encounter
difficulties.
He added: ''It is never too late for Government to think again about
the political importance of sustaining home ownership and to consider
those who depend on it thriving for a livelihood.''
The total assets of Scottish Building Society, the fifth oldest but
only the 54th largest, increased from #105m to #108m in the year to
end-January.

Harry Conroy meets a solicitor who put his
love of drama to good use in his work.
LOOKING the part comes naturally to Richard Findlay. For many years
the Edinburgh solicitor pounded the boards in amateur musicals and
drama.
At school in Huntly, Richard was torn between his two loves -- the
theatre and the law.
He remembers being taken by his parents to the Capitol Cinema in
Aberdeen, which he describes as a ''2000-seat 1930's art deco cinema
which not only had its own organ but a lighting device which lit the
auditorium and curtains in a different colour on every day of the
year''.
The Findlay family were also regular attenders at His Majesty's and
Tivoli theatres in the Granite City, and Richard dreamed of being a
theatre or cinema manager.
But, at the end of the day, the canny North-east temperament won
through and Richard's head overruled his heart. He went to Aberdeen
University to take a law degree although he maintained a keen interest
in the entertainment business.
His career took him to Edinburgh where his twin loves came together
again. In 1979, a year after he had arrived in the city, he decided to
buy a flat in Royal Crescent. To help with the costs Richard wanted to
share the flat with someone.
He wrote to the Lyceum Theatre Company, who took up his offer of
lodgings for actors.
''My relationship with the Lyceum Company led me to acting for them in
a legal capacity a year later when they were taking a lease on the
property,'' he says.
During this period Richard combined his professional legal work with a
continuing interest in amateur theatre, and in 1981 was a co-founder of
Edinburgh Music Theatre.
In 1990 he joined Tods Murray WS solicitors along with three other
partners from Ranken &amp; Reid, which is now dissolved, and his legal
interest in the entertainment business took off.
Later this month Richard will be the only Scottish solicitor at the
Cannes Film Festival. He is also the only Scottish member of the
International Association of Entertainment Lawyers.
He now has 80 clients in the entertainment business, including not
only the Lyceum Theatre Company but also the Edinburgh Tattoo, Opera on
a Shoe String, Italian Film Festival, and the Edinburgh International
Jazz Festival.
He also acts for producer Christopher Young whose films included
Prague and Venus Peter.
Given these responsibilities it is not surprising that Richard's
workload is now entirely directed towards the entertainment business --
a fact taken note of by Tods Murray when the company elevated the
entertainment sector to specialist department status two years ago.
While in Cannes, Richard does not expect to have much time to relax on
the beach.
The International Association of Entertainment Lawyers and the
International Bar Association run a joint conference at Cannes annually,
and this year it will major on the EU directives on copyright law.
In addition, he will be looking after the interests of three clients
whose projects are now at the development stage.
''It will be worth talking to possible co-producers,'' says Richard.
''Cannes is a huge network of contacts with 15,000 business executives
milling around.''
Richard believes that Scotland can stake a place in the international
entertainment business.
''There is a wealth of individual talent out there with a wide
portfolio of projects but they need a kick start.''
Last month Richard did a mailshot to 25 Hollywood studios pointing out
the talent available in Scotland.
''Why should we feel intimidated by the film moguls. We have a lot of
good talent here and we should be building a linkage direct with
Hollywood rather than everything going through London,'' he says.
''Last year there were more than 100 international lawyers present in
Cannes, and I found that there was a genuine fondness for Scotland. We
can forge worthwhile international links.''
Already, he says, there are signs that this is happening. He cites the
example of Edinburgh clients who have formed a business association
including a partner in Hollywood who will try to sell scripts written in
Scotland to Hollywood studios.
''There is also a French film producer who is doing a television
series using Scottish material and this series will be sold on an
international basis,'' says Richard.
During this visit to Cannes, he is determined not to repeat last
year's ''mistake'' of turning down an invite to a Clint Eastwood party.
''I think I would do my best to go if given the chance this year,''
says Richard.
But there was no comment from Richard as to whether he would be
joining the ''alternative parties'' in the Petit Calton or Petit
Majestic which are the regular haunts of the newspaper hacks covering
the entertainment extravaganza.

The housing market is still in the doldrums, with little prospect of
better times before next year, another survey confirmed yesterday.
The Nationwide building society's latest house price survey confirmed
the flat picture reported earlier in the week by the Halifax, the
biggest society.
The Nationwide index for April showed an increase of 0.9% compared
with March, pushing prices ahead 1.1% on April last year.
But spokesman Philip Williamson said the rise did not reflect any
recovery in the market, with prices remaining broadly flat and nothing
to suggest a marked improvement is imminent.

BRIAN Smith does not strike you as the rebellious type. His quiet
spoken manner is what you would expect from a member of the douce
Edinburgh legal establishment.
But the establishment figures in the capital's Drumsheugh Gardens, the
headquarters of the Law Society of Scotland, can be forgiven if they
sometimes wish that Mr Smith would disappear behind the mountain of
paperwork which covers his desk, and stop troubling them.
Brian is chairman of SoLaw, a network of sole legal practitioners, who
have questioned what benefit they receive from their Law Society
representatives' trips abroad.
SoLaw's activities are at present restricted to Edinburgh but Brian
and his colleagues have plans to export their pressure group to other
parts of Scotland, with Glasgow being the next likely branch.
Solaw was formed several months ago because of disquiet among single
practitioners that their interests were not being given the attention
they deserved.
''The Law Society does not fully address the problems which affect our
type of practice,'' says Brian.
He says that two years ago, he raised with the Law Society the fact
that certain building societies were acting against sole practitioners
by refusing to accept them on their panels.
Little, he says, has been done. And as a result members of SoLaw aired
their grievances from the floor of the Law Society's annual general
meeting.
The society was asked to promote equally the interests of sole
practitioners and multi-partner legal firms, and also to illustrate the
benefit of attending conferences abroad.
''Traipsing round the world no doubt helps some of the large firms,
and promoting Scottish law is important but the society,'' says Brian,
''must ask themselves at what cost?''
SoLaw believes there has to be some re-allocation of resources at
Drumsheugh Gardens so that the problems facing the smaller legal firms
can be tackled.
Brian believes there are ''too many solicitors''. The competition for
work has led to the level of fees going down. He says: ''Bucket shop
conveyancing affects everyone. The Law Society told us that they took
our points on board, and said they would address them.''
In the coming months Solaw, Brian says, will be watching carefully to
ensure that these assurances have practical results.

JENNIFER Bryson's job in the new business world of further education
is to make money.
She works for the GCFT, Glasgow College of Food Technology, which also
takes in many other skills including hospitality and tourism.
Since further education colleges receive their funding directly from
the Scottish Office, they are encouraged to become more commercial. So
the GCFT-Business Enterprise was formed, with Jennifer Bryson as
director.
''It is a company, and our profits go back to the college by way of
convenant,'' explains Jennifer.
Running the commercial arm of the college means that Jennifer finds
herself involved in a wide variety of activities.
''The Federation of Goat Breeders asked us to assist them find a
market for goat meat, and we did some recipe development for them.''
Food companies also approach GCFT-Business Enterprise for assistance.
''We will put a panel together,'' says Jennifer, ''to taste a
selection of sandwich fillings and give our views.''
The college has its own canning line, and chilling and freezing
facilities.
''A recipe may taste fine before it goes through these processes but
may not be quite right at the end. This means it has to be adjusted
until it is acceptable,'' says Jennifer.
Jennifer started her career working in London hotels such as the
Strand Palace and Hilton hotels but has been involved with GCFT for the
past 10 years.
She is a keen golfer, and until recently refused to join a golf club
as she could not find one which offered women equal status. She says she
also works a minimum 9am to 6pm day, so did not see why her access to
tee times should be restricted.

AFTER local elections and before General Elections, the question of
constitutional change inevitably rears its head. The Conservatives'
recent severe knock in the local government elections has once again
stimulated speculation about the need for a separate Assembly in
Scotland.
As far as Finger on the Pulse is concerned, the question is
straightforward enough -- would Scotland be better off without the rest
of the UK or is the status quo the only way to preserve our current
route on the road to recovery? Is the climate right for change or would
greater autonomy for Scotland ruin our export prospects?
Where does the Scottish business community stand in this debate? A
recent Gallup poll conducted for international couriers DHL made
interesting reading. According to the survey, manufacturers in Scotland
favour the status quo rather than constitutional change.
On export prospects, 37% of firms said devolution would be harmful,
rising to 53% under independence. While 57% felt that devolution would
make no difference to their own individual operations, 47% thought the
same about the effects of a full break from the Union. The status quo
was the option least likely to make any difference to personal
prospects, according to 78% of the firms.
Surveys of this nature are all well and good, but what's the opinion
in the West of Scotland? Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Scotland's largest
business organisation, gave some answers.
Gavin McNae at Track 29 Ltd has no doubts about the way forward for
Scottish business.
''There's a global affection for the Scots. Scottish business benefits
from this positive identity, it opens doors. But, devolution or
independence? Devolution, as proposed, will not deliver us an increase
in identity.
''Indeed, it's to the contrary. Labour's devolution is worse than a
road to nowhere, it's a road to oblivion. Our Scottishness will be
devalued. ''Independence? Well, there are problems. But what the hell,
there are problems with the status quo and Westminster is fast losing
its significance both in the States and in Europe.''
Ramsay Duff, commercial director of Deveron Group Ltd, suggested that
the devolution debate was largely one of simple economics.
''Although it probably sounds like fence-sitting, I would really need
to assess the likely/intended impact on grants as well as on corporate
and personal tax rates, import/export duties etc before deciding whether
the status quo or some move towards separation would be better for
Scottish business.''
The fear within the business community over tax implications was
picked up by Professor Seamus McDaid, Dean of the Faculty of Business at
Glasgow Caledonian University. ''The results of the Gallup poll are
consistent with the general feedback that I have received when talking
to Scottish business people.
''Business optimism appears to be returning, albeit cautiously in
Scotland, and many within the business community here fear that
political change might delay or even reverse the painful process of
economic recovery.
''Businesses are currently in a situation of significant change, and
there is an underlying fear that constitutional change in Scotland will
exacerbate management difficulties. There is a fear of the unknown; what
will happen to business development and export support mechanisms
currently funded from Westminster? What will the tax implications be?
''The history of higher business rates in Scotland creates a fear that
devolution or independence would lead to higher business taxes. The
belief is that this would inevitably damage Scottish businesses by
making them less competitive, might reduce inward investment and could
lead to businesses leaving Scotland.''
The tax issue was also picked up by Eric Hagman, Managing Partner,
Scotland, at Arthur Andersen.''There must continue to be a level playing
field across the UK, particularly in individual and corporate taxation.
''The scales are weighed against Scotland enough with difficult
communications and other issues. It is very hard to attract top level
executives and any further discrimination would create more problems
here. Differences within the UK in corporation and even maybe individual
tax could result in companies transferring themselves to south of the
border.
''Other layers of government will cost money, and given the principle
of the EU and more close liaisons, devolution in Scotland could be
moving further from the recognised trends rather than towards what
fashion dictates.''
Deputy President of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Mr David Semple said:
''Business managers are just people, who generally prefer stability and
little change. It is noticeable that the comments from our members
relate to the impact of any changes on the economics and taxation of
their businesses and the level of personal income tax.
''This appears to reflect the prevailing emotion in the country of
reaction against the current political situation.In addition,
circumstances have changed in Europe. Is there a case to be made that a
tier of government between Edinburgh and Brussels at Westminster is one
too many?
''The people of Scotland are not daft. They do not wish to see the
country condemning itself to a system which will result in large-scale
emigration of our talent and in national poverty. If the real economic
issues are properly debated and exposed in advance of the great
political changes which are undoubtedly in store for us, a great service
would be done for our community.''

GLASGOW and Edinburgh are facing a shortage of new office space. But
while developers in the west are responding by bringing forward new
schemes which could provide an additional 600,000 sq ft of refurbished
space, the capital faces a critical shortage of quality open plan space
by next year, according to the latest Scottish Industrial and Commercial
Property Review, published by property consultants Ryden.
The statistics reveal that some 425,000 sq ft of space was taken up in
Glasgow over the last six months, a total of 795,000 sq ft in the year
from March last year. This encouraging figure is above the ten-year
average of 700,000 sq ft. During the last six months modern or
refurbished space accounted for almost 90% of the take-up.
The letting of the Grosvenor building on Gordon Street to Scottish
Amicable was the most significant transaction during the last six
months, effectively removing the last building in the city capable of
offering more than 50,000 sq ft of quality space.
With space evaporating from the city's stock, the redevelopment of 11
George Square by Liverpool Victoria has come to the market at the right
time. Although not due for completion until April 96, the scheme has
secured a pre-let of around 13,000 sq ft to the Tourist Board at a
reported rental of #18.50 sq ft, with incentives.
The Health Board is poised to re-occupy the 86,000 sq ft building at
225 Bath Street, effectively removing the property from the market.
Several long-standing government requirements will be turned into deals
in the next few weeks, soaking up even more of the city's dwindling
office stock.
Much of the demand in Glasgow continues to come from public sector
requirements, with little evidence of real improvement in demand from
indigenous professional firms.
There are now only two buildings in central Glasgow capable of
offering more than 30,000 sq ft in self-contained properties with their
own main door. The completion of 131 St Vincent will bring a further
23,000 sq ft to the market by August of this year, while 183 St Vincent
Street will add another 17,000 sq ft by early next year.
Very little other space will be available in the city centre by the
middle of next year. However, this lack of activity has encouraged some
developers to bring forward schemes which Ryden calculates could provide
a further 600,000 sq ft of refurbished space in and around Glasgow city
centre.
Such development would provide for about a year's average take up.
Rentals in Glasgow have marked time over the six months since the last
Ryden report. The best prime offices still attract around #17.50 sq ft,
supported by incentive packages. But tenants still secure top quality
space at around #15 to #16 sq ft if they are prepared to accept lower
incentives.
The report says that the Edinburgh office market is going through a
'slow but steady' recovery. Assuming demand remains firm, the city will
face a critical shortage of good quality space by next year. Much of the
capital's available office stock is in older buildings, some of which
will never be re-occupied as offices.
There is an increasing interest in direct development from major
financial institutions, but the lack of quality sites in the city is
restraining activity. Rental levels are still extremely competitive,
with prime open-plan rentals achieving #18 to #20 sq ft in the central
core (with incentives). Open plan space in peripheral properties is
attracting rentals of around #14 to #15 sq ft.
Why Fisher
House
is quite
a catch
WITH good quality office space fast disappearing in Glasgow city
centre, buildings like the 25,000 sq ft Fisher House at 80 Bath Street
are attracting interest from potential tenants.
Shauneen Kelly, of joint letting agents Colliers Erdman Lewis, says:
''We have strong interest in three of the four floors in the building,
although in the current market it is still taking some time to bring the
deals to fruition.''
The other letting agent is Hillier Parker. Rentals of #14 sq ft are
being sought.

THERE is, says Ronnie Ludvig, Edinburgh-based managing partner of the
accountancy firm of Moores Rowland, an amazing amount of financial
disarray among many senior business executives.
A great number of them, for example, are late lodging their annual tax
returns and consequently suffer penal notices of tax code. In several
cases legitimate claims for allowances against tax are not made (or not
made in time); often they have made no wills, while at the same time the
methods by which they have invested their money are, in Mr Ludvig's
word, ''inappropriate''.
Facts like these prompted Moores Rowland in general and Mr Ludvig in
particular during the 1980s to devise what they have called a financial
scheme for senior executives. Eighteen months ago, this scheme was
enhanced and introduced in a new form called the Executive Support
Package. The thinking behind it is that companies who wish, out of a
feeling of enlightened self-interest, to spend considerable funds on
items like Bupa membership and private patients' plans for their senior
executives do not do likewise with their senior executives' financial
planning matters.
However, the issue has implications further and deeper than this.
''When you get into arrears or into a mess with your tax, this becomes
a major concern which may psychologically affect your health.'' The same
point could be made about other financial matters.
It goes without saying that the most important part of a company's
''off-balance sheet'' asset is its key executives. The future
performance of a company is directly related to the performance of these
people as individuals. Many executives would agree that the
responsibilities of their job (not to mention the amount of time which
they have to devote to the supervision and training of others) leaves
them short of time to deal with their own financial problems.
Another reason for Moores Rowland creating its Executive Support
package is that, whereas most companies have recognised the effects that
the build-up of these problems can have on individuals' health and have
introduced private medical schemes and access to regular health checks,
this tackles only the symptoms and not the basic cause.
It is problems like these which the Executive Support package seeks to
address and it is, says Mr Ludvig, unique. ''I am not,'' he says,
''aware of any other system which can offer such a comprehensive and
such a packaged programme.''
This benefit-in-kind corporate programme is paid for by subscribing
companies and institutions, but the service is completely confidential
between the individual and his/her specialist adviser.
What happens is that a Moores Rowland specialist sits down with Mr
Executive for an initial private consultation of about an
hour-and-a-half, to make a detailed assessment of the client's problems
and potentials.
Out of this meeting, a written report is drawn up, and this forms the
basis for discussions with the executive. Out of this comes agreement on
a plan of action and on a regular meeting pattern (it should be noted
here that, in addition to the above services, the executive in question
has access to his specialist adviser, as and when required, for help
with solving specific problems).
The first year of any such contract is labour-intensive for Moores
Rowland, but the second and subsquent years are much less so. The cost
to the company is #800 annually, and this, together with the fact that
it includes unlimited access for the client to her consultant, makes it
appear a good deal.
The majority of clients take up the majority of the recommendations
and substantial savings can be shown for tax, investment planning,
wills, and similar matters.
The system, however, does not stop there. It also involves Moores Marr
Bradley, an independent pensions and insurance company, and CEDAR
International, specialists in career management, counselling,
in-placement, and human resources strategy. CEDAR (the acronym is for
Corporate Executive Development And Resourcing) is based in London, but
recently opened an office in Moores Rowland's Edinburgh premises.
CEDAR's director, Helen Pitcher, explained her company can offer a
service complementary to that of Moores Rowland's Executive Support.
Specifically in the context of human stress (part of which is addressed
by Executive Support), Mrs Pitcher says that CEDAR is trained in group
dynamics and in psychotherapy applicable to human emotional processes.
In the highly charged matter of executive redundancy, she adds:
''Handling redundancies in an effective manner is the most challenging
issue facing many managers today. How best do you find your way through
the legal complexities and deal constructively with the 'people' issues
without demotivating those employees who will remain, and on whom future
success depends?''
Especially for those made redundant or for senior executives working
under stress, career counselling of the type offered by CEDAR is a
powerful analytical tool which allows people to examine skills and
thereby to unlock areas of individual latent potential. This process of
counselling is made all the more effective by allowing individuals to
make discoveries in self-knowledge by, and for, themselves.

WHITBREAD yesterday underlined its supremacy as Britain's outstanding
major pub operator and seems set to maintain that role given the turmoil
among some of its major competitors.
At the same time, it is spending heavily on expansion and
refurbishment at an annual rate of around #300m.
While Scottish &amp; Newcastle is currently turning round its #700m Chef &amp;
Brewer acquisition, it may face major management problems over the next
two years assuming it does acquire Courage from Fosters Brewing.
Inevitably it will have to be inward looking in concentrating on
integration rather than being on an expansionist mode. And Allied Domecq
has still to bed down comfortably with its Danish partner in
Carlsberg-Tetley which is currently losing beer market share.
Again while Bass is market leader with the size of the pub estate, it
is generally accepted that its food skills do lag those of Whitbread but
seems reluctant to spend heavily enough.
Whitbread was able to raise pre-tax profits by 17.7% to #275m last
year on turnover 4.7% greater at #2472m. But at the more meaningful
operating level, ignoring exceptionals, there was a 10.1% gain to #255m.
The exceptionals included a #40m gain on asset sales and a #20m
provision on selling the Keg restaurant chain in Australia which was too
small to be economic.
Chairman Sir Michael Angus said the result was achieved despite the
absence of the feel-good factor.
But perhaps the real secret is that Whitbread is by far the most
marketing orientated of the major brewers with both Sir Michael and
chief executive Peter Jarvis spent most of their careers with Unilever
unlike some of its peers who have tended to have risen through the ranks
of the beerage.
Whitbread Inns increased its contribution by 10% to #114m, helped by
the success of Brewers Fayres and is now almost three times as large a
contributor as the brewing subsidiary's #40.4m. Even the Beefeater
restaurant operations are now poised to match brewing over the next year
through the opening programme and good marketing.
Brewing achieved an 8% improvement in contrast to Bass which saw a 10%
decline in an admittedly five months out-of-kilter year-end. That
reflects not so much a rise in market share from 13.2% to 13.7% but more
important success with high-profile brands such as Boddingtons and
Stella Artois and even some gains with the more commodity-style
Heineken.
Its premium beers helped it increase share in both on-trade where it
managed a slight volume gain against a UK decline and almost twice the
average rate of increase in the take-home sector.
One disappointment was that of Pizza Hut where price war and intense
competition depressed margins. However, that may be a relatively
short-term effect with half the pain borne by brand owner Pepsico -- the
soft drinks giant is rumoured about to buy the non-US operations of
Grand Metropolitan's Burger King.
The pub estate managed a slight advance despite a 5% drop in sales as
a result of 183 fewer pubs trading to leave a total of 2182. There are
another 735 up for sale which should realise about #60m. Not that
Whitbread needs asset sale cash with gearing now a negligible 2.6% and
that will increase this year only as a result of rising capital
expenditure -- or acquisition.
But Whitbread on present form seems to have no need other than to grow
organically. Certainly anything that is not earnings enhancing should be
frowned upon given that since 1989-90, earnings per share have risen by
just 12.5% compared with the RPI increase over the same period of 22.2%.
The dividend total has advanced 7.4% to 20.2p for a 4.4% yield with
the shares up 10p at 573p and selling at a solid 13[1/2] times likely
earnings on the basis of profits advancing to about #280m.

ONE of the many problems facing business today is finding exactly the
right property in the right place for the right length of tenancy -- and
at the right price. And once a property has been located, it's then up
to the company to ensure it contributes efficiently to the business's
performance.
It is a problem that faces all businesses at some time or another;
local firms looking for more suitable premises, investors moving in, and
new businesses looking for their first home.
Now, teams of experts have been set up throughout the country with one
function: ease businesses into premises with the as little fuss as
possible. One such group is Dunbartonshire Enterprise's Business
Property Team.
Manager Fiona Robertson, with executives Nick Bird and Emma Speight,
have the task of making sure the property market in their area meets the
needs of business.
Fiona explained: ''We are here to take as much hassle as possible out
of any property issue facing a company.
''We recognise that property will always be secondary to running the
business but it can cost companies time and money if problems are not
identified and enough time allowed to deal with them.
''It is our job to step in where the market is frustrating company
start-ups, growth, or inward investment.''
One example is in Cumbernauld, where in the past property was provided
on greenfield sites by Cumbernauld Development Corporation (CDC) for
incoming and expanding companies.
The CDC is being wound up and the property portfolio has passed into
private ownership. But inward investors and expanding local companies
still need to know that they will find what they are looking for.
Dunbartonshire Enterprise discovered that there was a shortage of
large spaces for inward investors, so it ensured provision of two
factories at Little Drum, one at 49,000 square feet, the other 37,000
square feet.
The buildings are now complete and are capable of accommodating up to
300 jobs. Firm interest has already been expressed in one.
Fiona said: ''We will work with the new owners in Cumbernauld and
private sector development companies, to ensure that the town continues
to meet the needs of business.''
And there is plenty of other work for the team. In the growing area of
Healthcare there are plans for encouraging the development of lab space,
and incubator units for start-up companies.
The team works closely with their colleagues in Corporate and New
Enterprise Development, the inward investment team, Dunbartonshire
Locations, and the Healthcare Liaison Office.
Nick's responsibilities are to offer property support to corporate
development customers, while Emma assists new start companies. Fiona
ensures that Healthcare companies and inward investors have a range of
suitable properties.
New service for new starts:
The property team's experience suggests that a great number of small
and new start businesses are often prevented from developing because of
property problems.
And that's prompted the team to introduce a new service.
Emma Speight said: ''Because of the nature of the property market, and
the financial position of many small or new companies, satisfactory
property solutions are difficult to achieve.
''The companies want flexibility and they do not want long leases. New
firms are often reluctant to use surveyors, partly because of cash
limits and partly because they think they will not get value for money.
For their part surveyors are often reluctant to accept commissions from
small firms.''
The result -- new firms end up not getting as good a deal and could
find themselves in unsuitable premises on unsuitable terms.
However, all that is set to change. Firms less than five years old and
employing fewer than 20 people will be able to use a new property
acquisition service, and get half the cost of employing a surveyor to
find the property, agree suitable terms, and negotiate the lease for
them.
Details of the service will be distributed through several outlets --
and, of course, directly from the property team.
Emma said: ''We want to encourage small businesses to appreciate the
impact property decisions can have on their development, and to
encourage the use of professional advice.''
Making the best of what you've got:
But what if you've got your property. How do you know you are making
best use of it?
To answer this problem a second new service is being introduced.
Nick Bird says: ''It is a fact that a significant number of small and
medium-sized firms fail to optimise use of their properties.
''The bottom line is that good property management can increase
profits -- yet it all too often takes a back seat.''
This service, which will be offered in conjunction with a company of
chartered surveyors would again pay half the costs of an audit.
The main areas it would cover are the lay out and use of existing
space -- including development opportunities, building structure and
fabric for maintenance, security, and insurance risks.
The new start and property audit services are expected to be running
by the spring.

BRITISH Midland, the UK's second-largest scheduled airline, returned a
three-fold increase in profits last year.
The airline boosted its turnover from #371.1m in 1993 to #404.5m last
year and saw pre-tax profits rise from #1.1m to #4.4m.
Chairman Sir Michael Bishop said: ''During 1994 we benefited from
improving market conditions despite having to meet price competition
directly from a number of European carriers receiving significant
subsidies from their sponsoring governments.''
The airline performed well on all routes with total passengers on
European cross-border routes rising by over 22% meaning that for the
first time international routes were responsible for over half of all
revenue.
During the year new international routes, including Glasgow to
Copenhagen, were introduced and growth was recorded on established
routes like London to Paris which showed an increase in passengers of
over 24%.
The airline conceded that some of the growth on domestic services was
due to rail disruption last summer but were encouraged that traffic
growth has continued in the current year so far.
British Midland has recorded modest profits during each of the last
four years at a time when many of the world's major airlines have
incurred heavy losses.
Sir Michael added: ''Strong growth in the number of passengers carried
and a continuing drive to reduce costs has enabled the airline to report
an improved result compared with the previous year.
''The 1994 results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of
achieving growth through code sharing and other marketing alliances with
major partner airlines.
''We are resolved to continue the campaign to eliminate
anti-competitive activities which seriously distort the market, such as
state subsidies received by some of our major competitors in Europe.
''In the absence of any adverse circumstances affecting the air
transport industry, I am hopeful that British Midland will further
improve its profitability in 1995.''

FIVE years ago Jeanette Wood gave up her position as an executive
secretary to set up a company to supply help for working mums.
The problems Jeanette had faced when bringing up her own family and
going out to work made her realise that many working mothers would make
use of a service which made their dual roles easier.
''I took voluntary redundancy from the firm I was working in,''
explains Jeannette, ''and for the first time in my life I had nothing to
do as my family had grown up''.
Determined not to be redundant for too long, Jeanette Wood thought of
how she could have done with some help while her family were growing up,
and she herself was working.
She took a business management course, and carried out market research
to find out whether working mothers were still facing the same problems.
The research confirmed the need and Jeanette formed Mini-Mums based in
Rutherglen, Glasgow, to offer a variety of services ranging from
supplying a full-time, live-in nanny, to a person who will watch the
children between the end of school until the parents arrive home from
work.
Mimi-Mums also have workers on their register who will do housekeeping
or babysitting.
''First of all, before I could offer a service, I had to find people
who were interested in this type of work,'' explains Jeanette, ''but
this was not a problem as many mothers, who had themselves given up
their jobs while their family was growing up, saw this type of work as a
method of re-entering the workplace''.
Mini-Mums started with between 20 and 30 workers, but now has more
than 200.
''We mainly supply a service for professional people,'' says Jeanette,
''and in recent years the demand has grown as more women return to work
after their baby is born''.
She added: ''We do not employ the operators. We act as an employment
agency which acts as a conduit between those who need a particular
service and others who are willing to provide it.''

A Scots-based fashion designer tells Aileen Little how her idea to set
up a company to design and make quality garments for the young has
mushroomed in the past five years
AS a student of fashion and design at St Martin's School of Art in
London, Julie Brodie was asked to find work experience to turn theory
into reality. She spent three years with Jasper Conran, which is
probably not unconnected with the growing success of Brodie's own design
label -- the children's wear company 123 Go.
''I learned how an independent designer company works, from initial
pattern and amendments to fittings,'' she says.
Add to the Conran placement a year with Jeff Banks in 1984, when
Brodie helped put together costumes for the Eurythmics, plus a spell
with Chelsea Girl, and it seems less than surprising that such solid
grounding should result this month in interest from New York's top
designer store Barney's, and from Scotch House.
In partnership with her sister-in-law Andrea Tyrer, who takes charge
of everything other than product design, Brodie has built up 123 Go over
five years. She and her husband moved from London to Ayrshire, where he
had originally come from, in 1989 when expecting their first child.
Brodie wasn't one to sit idle. ''I realised there were no nice,
British-made children's clothes and I got together with Andrea who was
head of English in a London school. She has terrific organisational
skills.''
The pair saw a gap in the market for well designed, easycare, well
made children's clothes. Versatile outfits smart enough for, say, a
wedding, yet not so over-the-top they look out of place in the
playgroup.
At the start they met nothing but prejudice. ''For years, the French
have dominated the children's wear market and retailers lack the
confidence to take something British on. It takes time to break through
all that.''
Despite the company's 100 accounts in the UK -- and one in Saudi
Arabia -- Scotland's capital city does not stock 123 Go. Glagow, on the
other hand, has five stockists.
''In terms of adult fashion Glasgow has always been more exciting than
Edinburgh and the children's wear market reflects this,'' says Tyrer.
Negotiations with Barney's, who are interested in taking the autumn 95
collection -- Julie Brodie designs two collections a year, working a
year in advance -- is testimony to the firm's preoccupation with high
standards. It is as a company which manufacturers quality design in
house, and its place at the top end of the market in Scotland is unique.
In the UK as a whole, companies with a comparable price bracket focus
more on special occasion wear. Scotch House is discussing a tartan
collection.
''It's flattering,'' agrees Tyrer, ''we're pleased to be recognised by
people with international status and it should help us in the UK
market.''
In Britain, the majority of new accounts come about when loyal
customers move to a new area and demand 123 Go clothes. Tyrer adds: ''We
don't have a massive marketing budget -- the quality of product sells
the range.''
It is a product which turns heads. Each design is produced by the
10-strong workforce in batches of 100-300 and in European fabrics which
are natural and washable.
Brodie's own two children, aged seven and two, serve as catalogue
models. As for Brodie's sales director sister-in-law, she reckons time
spent at the chalk face of an inner city school was time well spent.
''Some people think teaching is an isolated skill. But you learn to
control a budget, to organise staff, and to produce the goods at the end
of the day. Your capacity for hard work is honed.''

WOMENSWEAR group Country Casuals moved into the red last year,
recording a loss of just under #1m compared with a pre-tax profit of
#2.6m in 1993.
Sales were up 23% to #50.5m but the company's profitability was
adversely affected by #400,000 set-aside to cover disposal of some Elvi
outlets and took a #1.7m hit on the sale of its Koto young fashion
chain.
Now that Koto has been sold and Elvi, its larger women's brand has
been reviewed the board believes that there is now a sound basis for the
profitable development of the business.
Chief executive Mark Bunce drew attention to the fact that Country
Casuals, the core brand, returned its best-ever result last year with a
profit of #3.3m and Lerose Manufacturing made significant progress in
filling production capacity.
Elvi is expected to make a further loss in the year ahead but it is to
be expanded at a slower rate so losses should not be as large as last
year #2.7m.
Although 1995 is likely to be a year of consolidation the core
strategy remains the cultivation of a portfolio of brands to provide
long-term growth.
The group's balance sheet is strong and so despite the disappointing
performance the divided is being maintained at 4.3p after a final
payment of 2.89p.
Country Casuals shares were a penny off at 108p where they yield 5%.
* FASHION group French Connection has applied to move up from the
Unlisted Securities Market to a full stock market listing from May 9.

GOLF: ITALIAN OPEN
SAM Torrance, hoping to make an eighth Ryder Cup appearance in
September, will be striving to improve his position in the Cup points
table at the Italian Open in Milan this week.
Only three of the top 15 in the Cup points table -- Torrance, Italian
Costantino Rocca, and Mark James -- are competing here this week.
Victory -- with a first prize of #61,642 -- would take Torrance, who
missed the pairs event in Paris last week, up into fourth spot and
considerably nearer a coveted place against the Americans in Rochester
in four months' time.
But he says: ''I'm not setting myself a particular points target for
the Ryder Cup. The big tournaments, with the biggest prize money, are
all coming up and I intend to play in most of them.
''My back problem has gone and I'm fit and well, and could do with a
good finish here this week. At the moment I'm just hanging on by my
fingertips to tenth place in the Cup table.''
Torrance hopes that yesterday's dry and sunny weather lasts for the
next four days. ''I've played in gale-force winds in Portugal and
Barcelona, and in torrential rain in Cannes during the past month,'' he
says, ''so it would be nice to play in good conditions for a change.''
He still retains a great sense of humour. Asked by Italian journalists
who would win this week, the 41-year-old Scot replied: ''Costantino
Rocca, of course. That went down well with all the local press, I'm not
daft you know.''
Rocca, sixth in the points table, is desperately anxious to make the
team again ''to prove myself''. James, fourteenth in the table and
winner of the Moroccan Open only last month, Ronan Rafferty, Paul
Broadhurst, Joakim Haeggman, Peter Baker, Andrew Coltart, Robert
Karlsson, Greg Turner, and Adam Hunter are others all with high hopes in
Milan.
* SCOT Gordon Sherry will make his European Tour debut in next week's
Benson and Hedges International at St Mellion in Cornwall.
The 20-year-old internationalist from Kilmarnock, runner-up in last
year's amateur championship, has accepted an invitation to the
high-profile televised event, which has attracted fellow Scot Colin
Montgomerie and top Spanish duo Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria
Olazabal.
Said Sherry: ''This is a great chance to play with some of the best
golfers in Europe, and if I can make the cut after two rounds, I'll be
delighted.''
The tournament starts a week today and Sherry, the man with the lowest
handicap in British golf, will partner Olazabal in the opening pro-am
competition the previous day.

THE UK financial services industry is in the doldrums after several
broadsides from the regulators which have dented consumer confidence and
with it demand for personal pensions.
Martin Broughton, deputy chairman and chief executive of BAT
Industries, the tobacco and insurance company, said that considering the
difficult trading background, particularly in the UK, the 10% uplift in
trading profits in the division to #240m was ''no mean feat''.
Profits in the general insurance business grew by 7% to #135m despite
some softening in rates. The life and investment business was 14% higher
at #105m.
BAT owns Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star in the UK. Allied Dunbar, in
particular, has a reputation for hard selling. Its profit contribution
in the first quarter was held at #44m, although total premium income was
down 24% at #346m. New business premiums were 29% lower. Eagle Star's
profits were static at #37m.
Mr Broughton said that the new disclosure requirements on commissions
were ''cumbersome and costly'' and added that on the evidence so far
they appeared to ''mean rather more to regulators than consumers''.
On the issue of mis-selling of personal pensions Mr Broughton said
that the Government should take a lead on reinstatement costs for state
employees, while the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), the regulatory
body, should issue guidance on how private insurers could calculate
reinstatement costs.
Mr Broughton believes that only about 5% of total policies were likely
to require compensation. Last year, BAT set aside #125m to cover costs
associated with the regulatory crackdown. The Office of Fair Trading's
recent criticism of endownment mortgages was ''full of flawed thinking
and inconsistent,'' said Mr Broughton. He said the problem lay with
overlending rather than repayment method.
Asked about the Government's aborted tax on mortgage protection, of
which Chancellor Kenneth Clarke appeared to have no knowledge, Mr
Broughton said he was ''amazed''. ''It just does not stack up apart from
being politically naive,'' he said, adding that in effect the protection
was similar in character to an insurance claim.
Fortunately for BAT Industries it has its extensive tobacco interests
worldwide which grew strongly and enabled the group to report record
first-quarter pre-tax profits of #498m, at the top end of City
expectations.
First-quarter tobacco profits increased by 27% to #335m. It has a
10.6% share of the world tobacco market.
BAT benefited from volume gains as a result of its acquisition of
American Tobacco last year. US tobacco profits rose by almost 50%. The
sales and adminstration operations of the two companies have been
amalgamated with the loss of aroud 1500 jobs. A further 800 jobs could
go in the US if a buyer is not found before next summer for the American
Tobacco manufacturing plant.
There was a strong recovery in performance from its Brazilian
operation. Group tobacco sales were 14% higher on a like-for-like basis
with BAT gaining market share in several key markets including Japan.
The western markets are mature and greater awareness of the health
risks associated with smoking means that tobacco consumption is in
steady decline in countries such as the UK and US. Therefore BAT is busy
looking for new emerging markets with strong growth potential. It is
considering new joint venture opportunities in Vietnam, Turkey and
Poland.
Overall, the company is encouraged by trading in the first three
months of the current financial year. Chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy said
at the annual general meeting that he expected there to be a
''substantial'' rise in taxable profits this year and that shareholders
could expect a ''significant real increase in the dividend''.
BAT shares have enjoyed a two-month rally helped latterly by bullish
comments by the chairman at last week's annual general meeting.
The stock has been on an upward trend since closing at 411p on March
7. However, yesterday they succumbed to profit-taking dropping 3p to
474p after touching 489p immediately after the results.

ANYBODY who has tried to squeeze into the West Highland village of
Plockton lately will know about the modern phenomenon of televisio
popularis. This is how it works. A place which few Britons have ever
heard of is selected as the setting for a drama. Plockton, which doesn't
even have a police station, was chosen for the BBC polis-opera Hamish
Macbeth: it was a hit.
Soon, everyone from Canterbury to Kidderminster was in love with the
village, its pub, its characters and its Highland coos. The BBC had
taken the precaution of renaming it Lochdubh: there are, in fact, around
15 Loch Dubhs in Scotland, from Skye to Helmsdale, most populated by
brown trout. But that didn't seem to put anyone off the scent. Once
Plockton was identified as the Lochdubh to end all Lochdubhs (which
wasn't difficult when the publicity machine started cranking) it became
THE place to tow your caravan into and prime your camera.
At our coffee break in the Nerd House commissariat yesterday, we
discussed the latest development in televisio popularis.
Apparently, the Duke of Athol has started to charge a #5 toll for cars
to drive along his private road to Forest Lodge in Glen Tilt. This may,
or may not, be connected with the fact that the BBC has been filming in
Glen Tilt for a series called The Gamekeeper.
''What's unusual about this?'' asked The Braces. Acting as coffee
table devil's advocate, I said it seemed a sensible move. His Grace the
duke had figured out that there was going to be a lot more traffic from
Canterbury and Kidderminster bumping over his potholes: so it would cost
a bit more to keep the potholes in good order: so a toll wasn't
unreasonable.
The Braces said I was waffling. ''What's unusual,'' he said ''is that
the series about the gamekeeper hasn't even been broadcast yet. So we
are witnessing the creation of a marvellous business opportunity. I have
been looking for this sort of market gap for ages, and now I've found
it.''
We sighed. For years, The Braces has been going on about taking an
early retirement package (after all, he's now 36) if only he could find
an outlet for his entrepreneurial skills. Something different: something
uniquely Braces. He laid his prospectus before us.
We have never heard of a ''financial location consultant?'' Of course
we hadn't: there's no such thing. But this was what The Braces thought
he could be. It was now known that the best way to develop the tourist
potential of a given place was to use it as the setting for a television
drama. But even better, it was now shown that merely if filming had
taken place there, and the ratings of the series was in the lap of the
couch potatoes, there was an immediate exponential-enhancement to be
addressed.
His idea was that he would hire actors and a film-team, would go into
certain areas by pre-arrangement and pretend to make a television
serial. There didn't even have to be a script. He would offer local
business people and landowners a package -- publicity, advice on parking
charges, even road tolls if necessary -- and charge a fee based upon the
increased input from Canterbury and Kidderminster. What did we think?
Frankly, we thought his bum was oot the windae, but you don't want to
knock genuine enterprise. ''So who'll join me?'' asked The Braces. At
this point there was a fit of coughing, but you never know. I've heard
of worse ideas.
* THE business of ''the Churchill papers'' has got the Nerd House
chairman very excited, according to information I gleaned yesterday at
the third-floor photocopying machine. In particular, he has been
delighted by the reaction of his heroine, Baroness Thatcher, reported as
saying that her own papers should not be sold for #12.5m but made freely
available for scholarship and research.
''The Chairman has more boxes of papers than Baroness Thatcher,'' said
my informant, who I shall not name. ''If they go for scholarship and
research instead of shredding and dumping the savings and ego-boost
would be considerable.
I asked what the papers might reveal. ''Not for me to say,'' responded
my informant, sniffily.

DUNDEE United manager Billy Kirkwood has targeted former Rangers
players Stephen Pressley and Gary McSwegan to rebuild the stricken
Tannadice club.
He will move for the pair, who will cost around #1m, regardless of the
outcome of their relegation battle.
Scotland under-21 captain Pressley has had a torrid time since his
#750,000 move from Ibrox to Coventry City.
Now, manager Ron Atkinson, who has invariably surrounded himself with
experienced players at his many clubs, is ready to let the player return
home in a cut-price deal.
United also desperately require more firepower in attack and McSwegan
could fill the bill. He has suffered in Notts County's unsuccessful
attempt to remain in the Endsleigh League first division and failed to
command a regular first-team place. The striker, who cost #400,000,
would welcome the chance to relaunch his career at Tannadice.
Kirkwood knows both players from the days at Ibrox and highly rates
their ability to help transform his side.
With uncertainty surrounding the future of Slav defender Gordan
Petric, Kirkwood personally assessed Pressley last month. Then he
decided he was player to unite in defence with his Scotland under-21
team-mate Christian Dailly.

FIRM demand for sweet and fizzy soft drinks has underpinned the
performance of Tate &amp; Lyle, which reported a good rise in first-half
profits.
With the American corn sweetener side performing particularly
strongly, profits advanced 17% to #153m for the six months to March,
though this understated the underlying increase as operating profits on
continuing activities were 25% higher.
The improvement came in the US, where Staley did well on the back of
increased demand and further cost reduction and improved plant operating
efficiencies.
Volume was some 10% ahead and margins 20% better, though competitors
are bringing more capacity on stream which will restrain further
progress.
The company is a major supplier of corn sweetener to the soft drinks
industry, where a relatively mild winter helped sales. An industrial
dispute involving 700 workers in Illinois locked out by Staley is still
going on.
Amylum, which manufactures cereal sweeteners in Europe, also did well,
though #12.6m was provided for the costs of a reorganisation which will
begin in 1996. This reflects a shift of raw material from maize to wheat
which is a cheaper feedstock in Europe.
Sugar was less happy, though the Western beet processing business in
the US recovered due to lower costs and higher processing efficiencies.
But a big increase in beet planting hurt the cane-crushing operations in
the east of North America. Tate says political factors were responsible
for this.
Cane refining profits overall were lower because of falling prices,
while Redpath in Canada suffered from low-priced imports from the US.
Activities in the UK were helped by devaluation of the green pound.
Chairman Sir Neil Shaw commented: ''The company is doing well, spread
over most of its businesses with the exception of North American sugar.
So overall the company is motoring along well.''
The first-half result was at the top end of expectations and analysts
raised their full-year projections to top #300m, against the #274m
actually achieved in 1993-94.
The interim dividend is lifted 9% to 5p and Tate shares rose 3p to
445p.

AFTER just six months, Fraser Walker has quit the City of Glasgow Club
and is moving south to join coach, Paddy Hayes, at Warrington Warriors.
He will head to England next week, but his longer-term plan is to join
a new Edinburgh set-up that is currently being shaped through
discussions among the capital's clubs, Edinburgh District Council, the
Scottish Sports Council, and the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association.
Since he won the 200m medley bronze medal at last summer's
Commonwealth Games, little has gone right for Walker, and the latest
disappointment came last month when he failed to make the British team
at the trials for this summer's European Championships.
It has prompted another rethink to an already disrupted season. The
21-year-old from Dunfermline left the Warrender Club last summer
following the departure to New Zealand of coach Kim Swanwick, and then
spent a couple of unhappy months at the University of Georgia.
The new City of Glasgow set-up appeared ideal when he returned home
from America in November to start swimming full-time. But he has failed
to hit top form this season, felt that he needed a change, and opted for
Warrington.
''The Edinburgh set-up seems to be quite promising, and I would rather
be able to stay at home,'' he said. His main target this summer is a
place in the Scottish team that will compete in the Canadian National
Championships in August.
Meanwhile, advertisements for the post of head coach for the new
Edinburgh set-up will appear this month. It is hoped that the system,
which will benefit from funding from outwith the clubs, and better use
of the facilities, will be up and running by late summer.

MIND games have Aberdeen believing they are premier division escape
artists instead of relegation certainties, writes Ian Broadley.
Acting manager Roy Aitken has held numerous meetings with his players
to ensure they are mentally ready for the daunting challenge. The
talk-ins have been given the same priority as tactics in the bid to beat
the drop for the first time in the Pittodrie side's history.
Aitken, handed the unenviable task of saving them when he took over
from Willie Miller three months ago, revealed yesterday: ''When I
accepted the job I maintained that our plight was down to one or two
things -- the players' state of mind or their fitness.
''The latter was not a problem because I immediately increased the
training schedules to guarantee that they were physically 100%.
''I have spoken to the players on many occasions, both individually
and as a group, to find out if they were mentally prepared.
''Frankly, man-management is just as important as coaching in my
opinion. Most of the players -- and there are a lot of good ones here --
have had to play well in order to be signed by the club. They know their
roles and understand how they must perform.
''But we were not getting a level of consistency in our form which was
responsible for the club being dragged into relegation trouble.
''I demanded that they be honest and think about getting more out of
themselves. The gauntlet was thrown down to them and they have responded
superbly.''

IT is winner takes all this weekend at the Lancashire Open, and Anne
Gibson, the six-times Scottish champion, is hoping that she will be the
winner.
The title and prize money are not the only things at stake at the Salt
Ayre Centre where the last event of the Friends Provident British Grand
Slam series will be fought out.
Whoever is successful also will earn a place in the Grand Slam final
at Gateshead in May as well as the chance to become Britain's top
player.
The 22-year-old London-based Scot is in joint second place in the
rankings with 300 points, alongside England's Jo Muggeridge, and, with
leader Julia Mann already assured of her place in the final, the race is
on to see who will join her.
''Basically, whoever wins this weekend will go to the final,'' said
Gibson, Scotland's sole member in the British Olympic squad. ''Tanya
Grove is only another 10 points behind us, and as Julia has decided to
opt out, the whole thing is even more interesting. It's all down to this
weekend.''
Bruce Flockhart, of Stirling University, also is in with a chance of
reaching the final.
Fresh from a successful sojourn to the Austrian Open, where he was
narrowly defeated in the second round by the No.2 seed Michael Sogaard,
of Denmark, the 22-year-old Scottish champion currently lies in fifth
place. The team for the Lancashire Open is:
B Flockhart (Stirling University), C Robertson (Fauldhouse), G Rankin
(Kilmarnock), S Paisley (Airdrie), B Kinnaird (Kinross), C Johnston
(Grangemouth), K Middlemiss (Edinburgh), R Hogg (Dunfermline).
A Gatt (Edinburgh), P Hume (East Kilbride), A Gibson (Marlow), G
Martin (Barnt Green), S Watt (Penicuik), K McEwan (Bridge of Weir), E
Allen (Edinburgh), J Allen (Edinburgh), J Haldane (Kirkcaldy), P
Whiteford (Airdrie), A Blanchflower (Glasgow).

IAN PAUL . . . on the relegation dogfight
THEY had the day off yesterday, contrary to what their manager had
promised the night before. You can never be sure of Partick Thistle, as
a clutch of teams at the bottom of the premier division have already
discovered this season.
The team that for a long time had provided the others with a comfort
cushion as they languished at the bottom of the table has just about
completed the kind of escape for which Johnny Ramensky gained notoriety
a few decades ago.
Since and including Hogmanay, the Firhill side has played 18 games,
losing only four, winning seven, and drawing seven, an astonishing
record for a team that had been stuck at the bottom of the table since
early October.
Now they face one more weekend, one more push, one more passionate
afternoon and the deed will have been done. In their wake, three teams
of greater resources, higher profiles, and grander reputations,
Aberdeen, Dundee United, and Hearts, will be scrapping for the one sure
place left in the top league. Another fine mess Thistle have got them
in.
If the players who have produced this astonishing recovery -- they
were virtually counted out by December -- deserve every credit, one of
their most experienced, Chic Charnley, yesterday broke with
time-honoured tradition and praised the manager, John Lambie.
Charnley, who was left out of the side from January until the last two
games, has no bitterness towards the man who kept him on a watching
brief. On the contrary, he was anxious to point out that it is Lambie
who should be mentioned in all our despatches.
''I think the gaffer deserves all the credit for what has happened,''
he said. ''He should have been offered a bigger job long ago. He has
worked all his career with teams without resources and yet has shown how
well he can motivate them. Any other manager who has done what he has
would have been offered a top job. He and Gerry Collins deserve
everybody's thanks.''
If Lambie will appreciate the compliment you can be sure he will
dismiss it just as quickly as he did the suggestion that the 3-1 win
over Celtic on Tuesday had saved the club from relegation, to all
intents and purposes. Charnley agrees with that, too.
''We have got to get a point against Falkirk on Saturday but we won't
even be thinking like that. We will be going for three points because
that is the way we have approached these games.''
Charnley had been out of the side for three months but knew he would
be recalled for the games against Kilmarnock and Celtic. ''The gaffer
had told me I would be in for these matches because he felt my
experience would be useful at this stage.
''I couldn't complain about being left out because the boys had been
getting results. It was great to be involved again and the win over
Celtic was a tremendous result for us. I thought in the end we deserved
it.''
Charnley admitted to being ''quite pleased'' with his performance but
maybe the Thistle fans would put it a bit more positively. Now he and
his team-mates know that whatever else happens, they can only be
involved in the play-off which will be between the second-bottom club in
the premier division and second top in the first division.
They are determined to make sure on Saturday that even that
possibility is removed and that would leave a three-corner scramble for
the one guaranteed premier place left.
There are a number of permutations available, with goal difference
quite possibly coming into the argument, but if Lambie's tongue-in-cheek
request for a draw between Aberdeen and Dundee United at Pittodrie is
answered, the New Firm would be in desperate trouble.
In that scenario, if Hearts managed at least a draw against Hibs at
Easter Road, that would mean both they and Thistle would be out of
reach, leaving Dundee United and Aberdeen to sort out between themselves
the relegation and play-off positions. However, if either of the
north-east teams win, Hearts would need to beat Hibs to escape the
possibility of a last-game decider.
Aberdeen's caretaker-manager, Roy Aitken, in keeping with his
personality, has maintained a positive attitude in the midst of the
depression and, after his team's win at Tynecastle last week, he is
still in bullish mood.
''It makes it harder now to catch Partick,'' he said, ''but we are not
concerned by events elsewhere. I always knew we could rely on no-one to
do us favours. What matters is that the ball is now in our court. We
have our fate within our own grasp.''
There was a similar reaction from Hearts' assistant manager, Eamonn
Bannon, who said: ''The Thistle result did not come as a surprise to me.
I thought they would take something from the game but we ar e sill in
the position where we don't need favours from anyone.
''It is up to us to focus on our own performance and even before that
Thistle win it was crucial we do our own job well.''
Maybe it will not come as a surprsie, either, to hear that the Dundee
United manager, Billy Kirkwood, was in positive frame of mind, too. They
are like that, managers, otherwise there would be not much point turning
up.
Said Billy: ''I believe there is less pressure on us than Aberdeen
going into our game on Saturday. I accept they got a tonic from what
happened last weekend, but the implications are more serious for them if
they lose on Saturday.
''There will be no way back for them if they lose. They are relegated
and that's it. In our case it will still go to the final match of the
season even if we draw or even lose.''

THE DUTCH do it, the Germans do it, the Swedes do it, even the Cubans
do it! But in Scotland it is virtually absent from the workplace.
We are talking about bikes.
Commute on two wheels and your colleagues will raise an eyebrow; use
one for short business trips during the day and you are certifiable,
quaint, a weirdo.
Yet not so long ago, bikes outnumbered cars on the road. Indeed, bikes
still outnumber cars by a factor of two to one, but they lie unused,
rusting in garages or rotting in basements. Even as recently as last
year, more bikes were sold in the UK than cars and one in three adults
owns a bike.
The huge ownership figures suggest considerable latent demand for
their use. If we could only get more people out on their bikes we could
start to tackle the horrendous pollution, ill-health and environmental
damage that accrues, on a compound basis, from the rampant use of motor
vehicles.
But the combination of a high level of company car ownership and the
lunatic incentives to boost business mileage means that most business
people prefer a soft seat to a hard saddle. As a result, much of the
blame for congestion and the pollution now lies with the business
community.
Yet when you consider that 75% of all trips are of less than five
miles, and 50% are less than two, the argument is compelling. Penalise
unnecessary, short journeys or encourage the transfer to sustainable
transport, such as shanks' pony or the bicycle.
Furthermore, if you support the theory of interdependency, then you
will know that to survive and prosper, businesses must work in harmony
with the environment and the community they serve.
Why then, do so few companies have a ''bike-friendly'' policy? Why, if
Scotland is being marketed as a ''green'' inward investment location, is
none of its leading public sector organisations backing ''bikes for
business''? And why do private sector businesses that sponsor, or enter,
''environmental'' awards fail to operate environmentally-friendly
transport policies?
Who knows? Is it laziness? Incompetence? Or just that nobody has ever
bothered to press the point?
Bicycles should be on the business agenda -- as a matter of priority.
They work, they really do, and they are good for the bottom line -- in
more ways than one! There is documented evidence to show that staff who
cycle take less time off work, are more productive, and enjoy an
improved sense of well-being and morale. Furthermore, bikes slash
distribution and travel costs and can be offset against tax.
It would seem, therefore, that the problem is not fiscal, but
attitudinal.
Take the recent Getting Scotland Moving transport conference organised
by the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce on behalf of all Scottish Chambers.
The organisers managed to omit environmentally-friendly transport from
the agenda, despite repeated pleas from the Glasgow Cycling Campaign.
Angry campaign members, many of whom are in business, took time out to
lobby the delegates. We won our case, they supported our view and
cycling is now in the post-conference policy paper being presented to
Government.
The Chamber of Commerce simply hoped that the Glasgow Cycling Campaign
would disappear. Well, it won't. In fact, it is probably one of the
fastest growing pressure groups in Scotland. Many of its members, male
and female, also happen to wear business suits.
We all have a responsibility to lever Scotland into a greener, cleaner
transport age worthy of our children and our children's children.
Encouraging bikes in business is the key to a sustainable business
culture and the Glasgow Cycling Campaign is working hard to sell the
benefits. If a business wants to think bike, we will even help with
advice, guidance and support.
The Glasgow Cycling Campaign is a voluntary organisation that lobbies
for investment in a cycling infrasturucture and campaigns for wider
appreciation of the environmental and business benefits offered by the
bicycle. The Campaign office at 53 Cochrane Street, Glasgow G1 1HL.
We have written to a number of leading chief executives suggesting
that they support a ''bikes-for-business'' policy and pointing out that
they ought to be setting an example.
So, Crawford Beveridge (Scottish Enterprise), Stuart Gulliver (Glasgow
Development Agency), Geoff Runcie (Chamber of Commerce), Lex Gold (CBI),
Neil McIntosh (Strathclyde Region) and Tom Monaghan (Glasgow District
Council), we, and future generations, are still waiting for your reply.

DEREK DOUGLAS: Chief rugby writer
in Navacerrada, Spain
SCOTLAND'S Rugby World Cup squad has been told by the management that
the performance against a Madrid Select side on Tuesday night did not
come up to scratch.
Manager Duncan Paterson, announcing the line-up to meet Spain on
Saturday, underlined once again that Tuesday night's side, which won
unconvincingly 27-16, had not displayed the mental hardness or the
ruthlessness which distinguished the world's top sides from the
also-rans.
With the players about to travel to South Africa for the World Cup,
perhaps fear of injury had inhibited the Scots. That was understandable
but unacceptable. ''The All Blacks would have beaten Madrid by 80
points,'' he said.
The side to play Spain was, said Paterson, the first choice at the
moment.
Tony Stanger, who played his first game for Scotland at centre against
Romania just under a fortnight ago, resumes the midfield partnership
struck up in that game with Graham Shiel.
The intention in Spain was to give every member of the World Cup squad
a game. Both Stanger and Shiel played on Tuesday night, and the fact
that they have been chosen together indicates that, currently, they are
seen as the optimum pairing with Scott Hastings -- who played at
full-back against Madrid -- and Ian Jardine, who has just recovered from
injury and who also played on Tuesday, taking a back seat for the
moment.
Paterson, while stressing that every member of the squad was now
playing for a place in the opening cup game against Ivory Coast, said:
''The feeling was that Tony and Graham had done well against Romania,
particularly in attack, and we want to have another look at them.''
The second-row pairing of Damian Cronin and Doddie Weir means that
Stewart Campbell does not get a game on Saturday. However, The Dundee HS
FP man played on Tuesday night and, perhaps, not too much should be read
into that.
0
Gavin Hastings captains the side, the Scotland fullback having
suffered no lasting effects from a minor leg knock sustained during a
five-a-side football session at training yesterday.
Paterson praised triple try scorer Craig Joiner, named
man-of-the-match against Madrid.
''There was a buzz when Craig Joiner got the ball. You always thought
that there was something going to happen.''
Scotland -- A G Hastings (Watsonians); C A Joiner (Melrose), A G
Stanger (Hawick), A G Shiel (Melrose), K M Logan (Stirling County); C M
Chalmers, B W Redpath (both Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath), K D McKenzie
(Stirling County), P H Wright (Boroughmuir), D F Cronin (Bourges), G W
Weir (Melrose), R I Wainwright (West Hartlepool), E W Peters (Bath), I R
Morrison (London Scottish). Replacements -- S Hastings (Watsonians), I C
Jardine (Stirling County), D W Patterson (West Hartlepool), S J Campbell
(Dundee HS FP), A P Burnell (London Scottish), M Scott (Orrell).
* ENGLAND captain Will Carling claims rugby union is being run by ''57
old farts.''
The England pair make their cutting comments in Channel 4's new sports
series ''Fair Game'' tonight.
Carling is particularly critical of the way rugby union is organised
in England and Twickenham's reluctance to break with their amateur
traditions.
''If the game is run properly as a professional game, you do not need
57 old farts running rugby,'' he says.
''What I think gets me and a lot of players now is the hypocrisy of
the situation. Why are we not just honest and say there is a lot of
money in the game? It is becoming a professional game.
''There seems to be an awful lot of things the Union now do to make
money out of the sport but there is still this feeling that the players
should not make any money out of it.''
''Fair Game'' claims that the RFU make #12m a year from the efforts of
their international players.
Dudley Wood, RFU secretary, says: ''We are very lucky in having run a
sport for well over 100 years which is played for pleasure and not for
financial reward.''

After six months as pig-in-the-middle in trouble-torn Bosnia, the 1st
Battalion Royal Fusiliers are homeward bound. George Hume talks
to their CO
AS THE killing goes on in Bosnia, the men of the 1st Battalion Royal
Highland Fusiliers are coming home. They have packed and are shipping
out -- back to loved ones and safety, glad to be away from a beautiful
country soaked in the casually spilled blood of ethnic intolerance.
In the past six months there have been some good days and some days
that have not been so good, but, notwithstanding the fraught role of
being pig-in-the-middle, the snipers' bullets, landmines, and night
temperatures down to 30 degrees below, the sun always shone.
In the area where 1st RHF patrolled there are 200,000 displaced
persons living on the brink. They are free to move about the countryside
but few dare. Generally desperately poor trade hardly functions, and the
homeless ousted by ''ethnic cleansing'' rely for the fundamentals to
sustain life on the agility of the soldiers to get them through.
It is a strangely unbalanced community with most local men away at the
fighting front but, according to Lieutenant Colonel John Edwardes, MBE,
commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Royal Highland Fusiliers, duty
in Bosnia was a rewarding experience.
Wearing the blue beret of the United Nations, Colonel Edwardes and his
troops found themselves responsible for enhancing humanitarian
assistance to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, developing the peace in
Central Bosnia and between Bosnian Croats and Muslims. The rest of the
day, as the saying goes, was their own.
To do the job, keep the peace, and hold the line, John Edwardes had
1200 men under his command and a vast fleet of armoured vehicles in
which they clattered and slithered over the mud-swamped winter roads of
their territory. The troops were made up of the 700 men of his own
battalion, the 1st Royal Highland Fusiliers, 220 men from New Zealand,
150 from the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, 100 from the Household Regiment,
with a further 100 soldiers from various supporting elements.
''Without doubt, the best aspect of serving in Bosnia from my
standpoint has been the opportunity to command, direct, and lead 1200
men in a challenging and rewarding environment. Separation from family,
particularly my children, was the worst,'' says Colonel Edwardes, whose
contact with his wife Charlotte, Louisa, three, and Henry, one, was
limited to one phone call and one letter each week.
''The soldiers found the separation from family and loved ones the
hardest thing to take, although when it came to actual service here,
what they liked least of all was vehicle maintenance in cold and wet
conditions -- that and static duties. On the good side were the shows
put on by the travelling forces entertainers of Combined Services
Entertainment -- very popular. And the men also enjoyed the opportunity
to win medals and save money,'' says Colonel Edwardes.
The latter was not difficult. Service in Bosnia is not in any respect
like a posting to Germany or Cyprus -- the high living standards of the
former and holiday atmosphere of the latter normally taking care of any
spare cash. In Bosnia spending takes a back seat because, quite simply,
there are few opportunities. The country is on its knees; its people
just this side of starvation. Steins of beer and wind-surfing were not
options.
According to Colonel Edwardes: ''Relationships with the locals have
been outstandingly good -- they realise the benefits in both
humanitarian and security terms that we bring. But all social contact
has been through the conduct of professional tasks such as conversation
at checkpoints or during liaison visits to headquarters. There is no
opportunity to visit local bars, although we played sport with local
teams and started to run a local boxing team.''
Home for the Scots -- Fallingbostel in Germany is their base -- was
found in Bosnia in shared Portakabins similar to those that saw
foul-weather service in the Falkland Islands -- comfortable enough from
personal recollection but, as the months pass, likely to seem less and
less like the Dorchester.
The officers and NCOs lived in rented houses on the edge of the base
at Vitez. Colonel Edwardes shared his house with the battalion
second-in-command -- easier that way to talk shop -- and that
indispensable cog in military organisation, the adjutant.
The strict political neutrality practised in every military mess
provided a prerequisite to peaceful coexistence in the CO's house, with
a seemingly never-ending stream of senior politicians of all parties
making their temporary home from home there while they took a personal
look-see and made their own assessment of the apparently intractable.
Recent visitors included the Secretary of State for Defence, Malcolm
Rifkind; Labour's Shadow Foreign Affairs spokesman, Robin Cook; and the
Liberal Democrat party leader, Paddy Ashdown. A heavyweight
counter-balance to these political incursions was provided in the shape
of visiting groups of what the Army anonymously labels ''high-ranking
officers''.
A large part of any commanding officer's day is spent keeping in
touch. In Bosnia, especially in winter, this can amount to a major
expedition -- the make-up of the CO's entourage leaving no doubt that,
despite progress, Bosnia is a war zone, and potentially deadly. After a
breakfast of, invariably, toast and tea, Colonel Edwardes's working day
would begin at 8am, when he set off in a Land Rover Discovery -- ''on
loan from the Overseas Development Agency, which made me very much the
envy of other commanding officers, who had to make do with the basic
Army Land Rover''.
Colonel Edwardes describes his driver as ''experienced'', which means
different things in a war zone than on the M8. Riding along were his
bodyguard -- Army term: ''close protection'' -- signaller, and an
interpreter -- ''absolutely essential''. Weapons discreetly at the ready
and signaller on the air, they would be off round the ''parish'' --
Gornji Vakuf or Santici, Bugojno, a checkpoint of troops in their
Warrior fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers.
One day might be given over to advising the battalion companies,
another to meeting with the former warring factions in order, as Colonel
Edwardes puts it, ''to continue the peace process''. Chances were that,
on the move, lunch was either fish and chips or pizza, but an absolute
certainty, served up towards the end of every working day sometime
around seven in the evening, was an in-tray demanding clearing. That
''in-tray'' could include officers and soldiers who sought, or were
summoned, for interview.
Of the half million inhabitants in his zone, Colonel Edwardes says:
''Their houses vary from palatial to very poor. The majority now have
the basic necessities of food, shelter, water, power, and medical
attention. Most of the men are in the army and therefore often fighting
on the front line. Although everyone has the right to freedom of
movement everywhere, many do not yet have the confidence to travel in
the other communities' areas. Although there is local trade, very few
have spare cash to take advantage of it.''
Such is the nature of the current operational climate and of the
recent history in that part of the world, that there were few truly
humorous episodes during the battalion's tour in central Bosnia. Light
relief, recalls Colonel Edwardes, was provided at an informal supper in
Sarajevo, to which he took along his pipe-major. The majority of guests
were French officers but, language notwithstanding, after supper French
tunes were squeezed from the pipes and everybody -- without exception --
gave big licks to the Skye Boat Song.
The tragic side to duty in Bosnia comes more readily to the Colonel's
mind. ''Two young children were killed after stepping on a mine in
fields in Busovaca, near Vitez, early in the tour. Having two young
children myself, it was a particularly tragic waste and indicative of
life in Bosnia.''
A large part of Colonel Edwardes's energies were taken up chairing
committee meetings with government, police, and military leaders of both
communities to develop the delivery of humanitarian aid, seeing that
water, electricity and medical services are made available and to
organising and assisting with the rebuilding of schools.
Add to that the organisation of joint patrols on the former
confrontation lines to develop confidence between the two communities,
and the co-ordination of the marking and lifting of minefields and there
was, understandably, little time left in Colonel Edwardes's day for his
hobbies of photography, fishing, and hill walking.
''I missed the opportunity for long walks in the countryside, but
there is an aspect of life in Bosnia that I would like to bring back to
Scotland -- the sunshine. December and January were very cold, minus 30
degrees at night -- and there was plenty of ice and snow. The roads
became impassable because of deep mud, or dangerous because of ice, but
it has not been severe or as long a winter as we expected. Otherwise it
was warm and pleasant.''
Colonel Edwardes, raised mainly in the Far East and commissioned in to
the Royal Highland Fusiliers from Sandhurst 24 years ago, says
operations in the battalion's area of central Bosnia were particularly
successful. ''Trade is establishing itself and some industries are
restarting. Local government is reforming and there are all the signs
that there is trust and confidence between the two communities and that
people are living in relative peace and harmony.
''There are signs that a few, less than 100, of the population in the
area are beginning to move back to the homes they were forced out of --
a most encouraging sign,'' says Edwardes. That small triumph, he
concedes, must be measured against a population of half a million,
200,000 of whom are displaced persons.
Now the 1st Battalion Royal Highland Fusiliers are settling back into
European routine in Germany, unpacking their kit as it comes in from
Bosnia and looking forward to home leave. Whatever advice Colonel
Edwardes passed on to his successor, he could not have done better than
leave behind his most recent bedtime book, that classic of the Balkan
enigma -- Eastern Approaches, by Fitzroy Maclean.
A beautiful country soaked in the spilled blood of ethnic intolerance

WILLIE ''The Mighty'' Quinn, from Tranent, will spark a rush in the
east of Scotland today when tickets go on sale for his World Boxing
Organisation Continental middleweight championship challenge against
Worcester's Paul Busby at the Brunton Hall, Musselburgh, on June 1.
Beaten only once in 17 professional contests, Quinn has seen the
Musselburgh venue sold out the last three times he appeared there. With
a capacity of just 1000, the tickets -- priced #30 and #20 -- will be
quickly snapped up again.
Quinn, who will be having his first championship contest, has one of
the most loyal followings in the sport, and manager Tommy Gilmour said:
''It's going to be another great night for fans in the east, and this
could well be a springboard to the big time for Willie.''
The main supporting bout features featherweight Wilson Docherty, from
Condorrat, against Miguel Matthews, of Wales, and that should end all
speculation surrounding the Scot's future after he lost a final
eliminartor for the British title to Peter Harris in Glasgow 10 days
ago.
Said Gilmour: ''That was a big disappointment to Wilson, but we're not
letting him brood about it. The best thing for him is to get back into
the ring quickly, and Matthews is an ideal opponent. Wilson has
certainly not given up on his ambition to join his brother Drew as a
British champion.''
Drew, the bantamweight title-holder, will be able to give his young
brother first-hand knowledge of Matthews, whom he beat on points in
Musselburgh last year.
Also on the bill will be four unbeaten young Scots, welterweight Tommy
Quinn, the younger brother of Willie, light-welter Steve McLevy, of
Glasgow, Barrhead lightweight Mark Breslin, and Kilmarnock feather Ian
McLeod.

ABBEY National is aiming to carve out a bigger slice of the current
account market with the re-launch of its bank account which replaces the
existing current and high interest cheque accounts.
The new product will have a tiered interest rate structure which will
pose a competitive challenge to the banks and building societies. Rates
go from 1% gross for credit balances of under #500 to 5% for over
#25,000, so long as customers pay their salary into their account or
credit a minimum of #500 a month. Otherwise the interest rates are
halved. Balances are calculated on a daily basis so customers will
steadily drop through the tiers as their credit balance declines towards
pay day.
This beats other high street competitors, though some high interest
cheque accounts with smaller building societies, such as the Chelsea,
pay more, with fewer services.
Abbey has surveyed bank account holders to see what irritates them
most and top of the list was penalty charging when their account slips
into the red just before pay day. Close behind are general charges for
services such as stopping cheques or ordering duplicate statements,
followed by low interest paid on credit balances.
Over a quarter of the sample were dissatisfied and two-thirds have
seriously considered switching but were dissuaded from doing so because
of the hassle involved. Abbey has taken steps to make this easier and
maintains that 96% of people who have move their account to it were
satisfied with the ease of transfer.
The group recognises that current accounts are a mature market, with
80% of adults already having one, but hopes to improve its share above
the present 4%. With its various savings accounts it has about 9% of the
liquid savings market.
Authorised overdraft rates are currently 9.9% and Abbey says its
charges on unauthorised overdrafts are lower than competitors set.
Interest will be paid on cheques deposited after one clear working day
and cheques will be cleared within three working days, as the banks aim
to do. Some building societies have come in for criticism for taking
much longer than this.

PROVIDING the ideal circumstances and support to promote growth in
hi-tech companies is the challenging task of Strathclyde Incubator
Limited.
Its success can be measured by the fact that only four of its 25
fledgling companies have failed, in marked contrast to the national new
hi-tech company liquidation rate of 80%.
Of the others, one grew from being a one-man band to employing 30
people. Now it is a multi-million pound organisation. The rest are
flourishing in Scotland, contributing to the Scottish economy in
trailblazing technological areas.
Meantime, there remain in the incubator a further 25 or so nascent
hi-tech companies, whose owners come from diverse academic disciplines:
engineering, science, software, healthcare and electronics.
The Strathclyde University Incubator was established in 1990. It is a
unique profit-making partnership of private and public enterprise, a
joint venture between Strathclyde University, the Glasgow Development
Agency, the TSB plc, and Gresham House plc, a venture capital company.
Its purpose is to provide an environment in which anyone, academics
from the university in particular, could develop their research projects
into commercial companies.
Formerly, the usual practice was that academic staff with commercial
ideas would license them, and products would be developed by outside
companies. Strathclyde Incubator Limited, as an interface between
innovation and implementation, was keen to keep the wealth-generating
ideas in Scotland, to maintain Scotland's reputation for hi-tech
research excellence, and to foster native commercial enterprise.
Gillian MacAulay, the manager of the Incubator since its foundation,
explains how the company carries out its nurturing philosophy. It
operates from a refurbished 30,000 sq ft building on the campus. Client
companies take short-term flexible leases, and the Incubator provides
extensive support with central secretarial services, fax machines,
photo-copiers, desk-top publishing, and access to management advice on
areas such as funding, marketing, and business development.
Although it is a profit-making organisation, any profits are pumped
back in to provide more benefits for the client companies.
The Incubator differs from other business parks, local authority
enterprise initiatives, and so on in two ways. First, it is entirely
self-financing -- there are no Government grants. Secondly, it is
willing and able to be much more closely involved with its client
companies.
MacAulay has had an extensive career in business management. As a
marketing graduate of Napier College in Edinburgh, she went on to work
for a number of small businesses. She then ran a business centre in a
university in the US, so is extremely well qualified to understand the
problems of running a small business developing new products in new
markets on a tight budget, and the difficulties many academics have in
coping with the commercial exploitation of their ideas.
In one case, for example, an academic was anxious to develop his
micro-laser project locally; but he preferred not to be involved in the
day-to-day management of the business. The Incubator was the ideal
environment for his company.
Apart from the hands-on practical advice in terms of basic management
problems such as PAYE, VAT, marketing and so on, MacAulay is also
well-placed to network on behalf of the client companies. She can
introduce them to useful contacts, advise on future sources of funding,
and identify the most useful amongst the bewildering mass of
organisations which give help to Scottish businesses.
The other great benefit which the Incubator affords is less tangible,
but equally valuable. It creates the cosy environment in which the
sibling fledglings, provide mutual support. All the client companies
find it immensely helpful to be able to discuss and share their
individual experiences, their difficulties and their achievements.
In the five years since the Incubator was set up, there have been
plenty of achievements. As each company has grown within its two to
three-year period in the nest, new jobs have been created.
While about half the total number of client companies have now moved
on to larger premises, to employ more staff and become larger
enterprises, the other half continues to develop and enjoy the stable,
supportive environment which is so vital for any company breaking new
ground in terms of sophisticated technology.
MacAulay and her board of directors are proud that the Incubator's
trailblazing philosophy of combining philanthropy with commercial
viability is proving such a success for their client companies and
delighted that the Scottish economy is the indirect beneficiary.

Madrid
SPORTS medicine has come a long way since the man with the magic
sponge rendered the most effective treatment for all but the most
serious sporting ills.
Donald Macleod, honorary medical adviser to the Scottish Rugby Union
and medic-in-chief to generations of Scottish sides since 1969, has been
at the forefront of the revolution which has seen the sponge make way
for more high-tech therapies and to the acceptance of sports medicine as
a worthwhile speciality in its own right.
Macleod, a consultant general surgeon at St John's Hospital,
Livingston, relinquishes his team-doctor duties after next month's World
Cup in South Africa, but will remain as the SRU's principal medical
adviser.
With a small band of medical colleagues -- among them Stewart Hillis
who works with the Scottish Football Association -- Macleod has been
instrumental in persuading the various medical Royal Colleges in the UK
that sports medicine should become a recognised speciality.
''They have sports' medicine specialists as paid posts in the US,
Europe, Australia, and South Africa,'' said Macleod. ''In the UK we are
light years behind in our development of sports' medicine but I would
also have to day that in rugby, we are light years ahead of nearly every
other sport in the British Isles.''
Here in Spain on Scotland's pre-World Cup warm-up tour, and working
with his medical team including SRU fitness expert David McLean, who is
primarily responsible for honing the squad to reach peak condition in
SA, Macleod is responsible for keeping the players in good health.
However, the groundwork has already been done and the Scottish players
have been tended to by a battery of sports science experts, the likes of
which would have been unheard of a decade ago.
''The biggest single advance since I became involved has been the move
towards sports science,'' said Macleod. ''When I played for Edinburgh
Accies in the sixties, rugby training amounted to not much more than
flogging around the pitch.
''Now we have nutritionists, psychologists, fitness advisers, and
chiropodists. All of these people have contributed to the exceptional
standards of fitness achieved by the players.
Even 11 years ago Scotland was leading the way in the move towards
sports science and Macleod attributes the success of the 1984 Grand Slam
side to the fact that the players had achieved vastly superior fitness
levels to their opponents.
He became involved with the Scottish side almost by accident. ''When I
graduated I was resident to Professor John Bruce in Edinburgh. He was
hon surgeon to the SRU. He was a director with Hibs but knew little
about rugby. He asked his senior lecturer, Jimmy Thompson, if he knew
anybody who played the game. I had played until I fractured a knuckle,
so I fitted the bill.
''Between 1966 and '69 I just used to help out but in 1969, I sat on
the bench for the first time. It was a game against Ireland. Jim Telfer
was the captain and he was carried off unconscious after 15 minutes. The
only reason I was on the bench was because it was raining, and Sir John
and Jimmy Thompson were keeping dry in the stand.''
That first encounter with Telfer was to prove beneficial to the cause
of Scottish rugby. Telfer went on to become coach of the '84 Grand Slam
side and to have a hands-on involvement in the realm of coaching until
he became the SRU's first director of rugby.
Macleod found in Telfer a willing listener to the sports' science
theories which he was expounding and, after initial hesitation, the SRU
was persuaded that the medics had more to offer than just ministering to
players' aches and performing fast response needlework in stadia medical
rooms around the globe.
Which is not to say that being a dab hand with the stitching needle --
or more properly nowadays the stapling gun -- is no longer a
prerequisite for the touchline medic.
''The big secret about putting players back together again is to have
their trust. They all know me well and trust me. If I say to Gavin
Hastings: 'lie down, shut up, and I'll stitch you,' then that is what
happens.
''Luckily I haven't had too many cuts that I couldn't stitch. The only
time that I have really been shocked by a cut was with the 1983 British
Lions in New Zealand. Terry Holmes had been tramped on the head and he
had three parallel cuts to his scalp and face. Generally, though, and
contrary to popular opinion, most cuts happen when team-mates clash
heads.''
During his 26 years as team doctor -- for which sterling service he
was presented with a crystal decanter and glasses at the banquet after
the recent game against Romania -- Macleod has seen the players become
bigger, fitter, and faster.
Although the statistic tends to disprove the theory that the injuries
suffered by the current crop of players are more serious as a result,
there is no doubting the fact that bigger, fitter players mean bigger,
bigger hits.
''It's Einstein's theory of relativity, isn't it,'' said Macleod.
''The energy released in a collision is equal to mass times velocity
squared.''
This seems to equate to the age-old theory about the biggery they are,
the hearder they fall. Macleod believes, too, that the Australian
dispensation rule which regulates kicking to touch plus the fact that
players nowadays tend to run straighter than hitherto, means that many
of the bumps that he has to deal with these days come from head-on
tackling situations when knees seem to be particularly vulnerable.
However, he does not concur with the theory that there are more
injuries now than in days gone by. ''I think the fact that Gary
Armstrong, Andy Nicol, and Gregor Townsend and the rest have suffered
injuries to knees is just bad luck and coincidence. Twenty and more
years ago players still got injured knees but, in those days, the talk
was all about cartilages.''
Macleod says that he will miss his direct involvement with the team
but professional commitments mean that the time is right to step aside.
''No injuries, lots of tries all scored by Scots, and a little bit of
silverware at the end.
''That's what I'm looking forward to over the next couple of months,''
he declares.

JOHN Davies, the Airdrie midfield player who learned on Tuesday that
he will miss the Tennents Scottish Cup final against Celtic at Hampden
on May 27 because of a three-match suspension, will not be given a
reprieve by the SFA.
Davies was sent off during the match against Dunfermline at East End
Park last Saturday following a clash with Jackie McNamara in which an
elbow appeared to have been used. But although the player and his
Airdrie colleagues feel that referee Simon Dougal's decision was a harsh
one, he will serve an automatic one-match ban and a two-match suspension
from May 13.
That will rule him out of the cup final, unless the club finishes
second-top of the first division and qualifies for a two-leg promotion
play-off which will go ahead before the Hampden match.
Although television cameras were at the Dunfermline match, the SFA
confirmed yesterday that they will not use video replays to revoke
refereeing decisions.
''The association does not permit the use of television evidence,''
said chief executive Jim Farry. ''It is a clear-cut policy decision.
''That has been the succcessive decision of the SFA committees and the
SFA council for many years. It is a decision which is reviewed annually
and it must be remembered the clubs are the SFA.
''We do not use television evidence for the prosecution in
disciplinary matters so we won't use it for the defence.''
Airdrie also face a dilemma for Saturday's league match against
Hamilton at Broadwood. They still retain a slender hope of winning that
play-off place, but with another four of their players just one booking
away from suspensions that could see them miss the Hampden final,
manager Alex MacDonald must decide whether or not to field them in the
Lanarkshire derby.
Jimmy Sandison, Kenny Black, Alan Lawrence, and Graham Hay are the men
on the tightrope, and Sandison and Black have already suffered the
heartbreak Davies is experiencing at the moment. They both missed the
1992 cup final against Rangers, because of suspension.
Celtic defender Tony Mowbray is also out of the final because of a
ban. He was booked in last Saturday's 2-1 win at Falkirk and then again
in Celtic's 3-1 defeat by Partick Thistle on Tuesday.
That took him over the threshold of penalty points and he is set to
land a four-match ban, which means he will begin next season -- if he
signs a new one-year contract at Parkhead -- under suspension.

A #100m-plus package being put together by British Linen Bank Group
for the development of the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary is at a very
advanced stage, chief executive Eric Sanderson revealed yesterday.
The Edinburgh-based Bank of Scotland subsidiary is currently looking
at projects with an aggregate capital requirement of between #500m and
#600m, primarily in the health sector, as a result of the Government's
Private Finance Initiative.
British Linen, whose accounting period was extended to bring it into
line with its parent, made pre-tax profits of #13.2m in the 13 months to
end-February. This represents an annualised increase of 13% on the
previous year's figure of #10.8m.
Under the new arrangements for private sector financing of
traditionally publicly funded projects, British Linen aims to join
forces with construction groups and facilities management companies.
A senior Scottish Office official, with particular expertise in the
health sector, is currently on secondment with the bank.
British Linen would provide debt finance, as well as procuring and
possibly taking equity in the private sector ventures.
Indications of interest in the Edinburgh Royal project are being
invited before the end of this year. A site has been earmarked at
Craigmillar.
Mr Sanderson said: ''We are very advanced in our discussions. We are
putting together a whole package for it.''
Under the Government initiative, the relevant health service trust
would possibly contract out some ancillary operations, such as clinical
waste disposal and catering, while retaining control of the core medical
activities.
The level of risk which the Government will transfer to private
operators, in relation to volumes of business, is still being thrashed
out.
British Linen has set up an infrastructure unit specifically to pursue
Private Finance Initiative opportunities, seconding corporate advisory
and banking staff to it.
Mr Sanderson said: ''We have put a huge amount of resources on to this
and we feel we can really establish a good market position.''
British Linen's hike in profits was achieved in spite of losses of #5m
at Chicago-based operating leasing subsidiary IFA.
Hefty writedowns in computer-related assets in which IFA holds a
residual interest, necessitated by sharp falls in their second-hand
values, sent the normally profitable operation into the red.
During the year, British Linen provided many tens of millions of
pounds of senior debt for the myriad cable television projects in the
UK.
Since cable's early days 13 years ago, the merchant bank has built up
a wide knowledge of the industry and, using computer models, can advise
operators on the impact of changes in market penetration or costs.
In the year to end-February, it began the supply of senior debt to all
of the leading players, selling some of this to other banks.
British Linen's core merchant banking operation turned a #1m loss into
a #3.8m profit, helped by lower bad debt charges. A reduction in the
cost of funding non-performing debt, relating principally to the
property and hotel sectors, and increased fee income also aided
performance.
Fund management arm Dunedin maintained its position as the largest
manager in Scotland of funds from North America, which accounted for
most of the #726m of net new business secured during the year. Dunedin's
contribution to profits rose from #6m to #7.8m.
British Linen will be working hard as lead adviser to the ScotRail
management team's proposed franchise bid in the coming months.
It also plans to ultimately increase its in-house equity investment
company's portfolio from #5m to #20m.

CBI Director General Howard Davies, who is due to take up the position
of Deputy Governor of the Bank of England later this year, yesterday
sought to play down fears that a further hike in interest rates would
damage consumer confidence.
He was speaking ahead of tommorrow's meeting between Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke and Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George at which
it is widely expected in the markets that rates will be lifted to try to
stave off inflationary pressures and help bolster the weakening pound
which is a contributing factor.
Mr Davies commented, ''I personally think that a half-point rise is
unlikely to have a big impact on consumer confidence -- half-a-point
here or there, it is difficult to argue that that would have a major
effect.''
He said the CBI believed that the latest bout of weakness in sterling
was probably containable in terms of inflation and the government was
likely to be able to meet its 1% to 4% inflation target this year. But
he added, ''a further significant depreciation might put the target at
risk.''
The CBI Director General said there was undoubtedly an inflation-risk
in Britain because CBI surveys showed manufacturers were looking for
price increases. However, he said that forward looking indicators in
prices fell sharply in the recent CBI survey. ''This suggests the
pressure for price increases may moderate slightly,'' he added.

Elizabeth Buie examines the reasons behind the Whitbread success story
THE MacDonald family from Airdrie are typical of the kind of customers
that have built up the brewery giant Whitbread's family pub and budget
hotel business.
They are regular customers at the Brewers Fayre at Newhouse, mainly
because it is within easy reach of Airdrie, and it caters for their
young children, David, six, and Emma, four, in terms of a children's
menu and play areas both inside and outside the pub.
''We eat quite regularly and we find it is good value for money,
food-wise. Even if we have starters and puddings as well, we can eat as
a family for about #25, sometimes including drinks,'' said Mrs Julie
MacDonald.
Sitting at the table next to them last night was the other mainstay of
the business -- the businessman who travels regularly, but whose company
does not believe in paying luxury hotel prices.
Mr Dave Olsen, an engineer from Freeport, Illinois, stays at the
Newhouse Travel Inn whenever business takes him to the Honeywell plant
at Motherwell. He likes the price, convenience, and facilities -- and
says his company would probably baulk at paying more than the #34.50 a
night charged there.
It is people such as these who have allowed Whitbread's to announce
5000 new full-time and part-time jobs over the next nine months.
In Scotland, Whitbread's expansion plans represent yet another boost
to the service sector at a time when traditional industries continue to
falter. In Scotland alone, Whitbread's will be creating 630 jobs and
investing #19m.
Ken Graham, the company's regional and community affairs director for
Scotland, said: ''In the last 10 years, we have become more of a hotel,
food, leisure and pub company. The reason for that is reasonably simple
in that the beer market in the UK is in some sort of gradual, not
necessarily terminal, decline, and there are no signs that that trend is
not going to continue. It was important to find other ways of generating
profit streams.''
He has found that despite the recession in the past 10 years, the
eating-out habit has increased, and is continuing to increase.
In the budget accommodation market, Trusthouse Forte is experiencing
similar trends. John Miller, sales and marketing director for the Forte
Roadside Division, says that 10 years ago, the budget market did not
exist in the UK.
''It seems to have caught the public imagination,'' he said.
Perhaps, more to the point, it suits the public's pocket. A family of
up to five can stay in a Travelodge hotel for #34.50 a night, and enjoy
tea and coffee-making facilities, television, and an en suite bathroom.
Travellers are prepared to forego room service, and a telephone in
favour of a guaranteed standard of accommodation at an affordable price.
Professor Udo Schlentrich, professor in hotel management at
Strathclyde University's Scottish Hotel School, said: ''Travel expenses
are the third-highest controllable expense of business. Companies are
now saying to their travelling executives that they have to stay in a
cheaper hotel as the companies have to lower their expenditure. What is
the difference between #80 or #45? A room is a room.''
He points out that in the past, budget hotels tended to be former
four-star hotels which had fallen on hard times and been allowed to
decay. Worn at the edges, a bit depressing, they did not attract
families.
A similar trend has crept into eating out. Affordable restaurants in
the past tended to be confined to ''greasy spoons'', American-style fast
food eateries, or smokey pubs, dominated by men.
As heavy industry has declined, the male tradition of leaving work,
having a drink in a pub, and then going home has declined. Increasingly,
women are entering the workplace, and they are dictating terms when it
comes to eating out. They want to be able to take their children, or
they want to sit in more conducive surroundings with their partner or
friends.
''One part of the reason why a company such as Whitbread, and some of
the larger brewers, are looking at the hospitality sector is largely
because of a change in society as a whole. On the one hand you have the
dual-earning householders syndrome where they say they do not feel like
cooking at home, so let's go and have a family meal in a restaurant
environment. The traditional option of a smoke-filled pub was not
particularly children-friendly and did not address the family psyche,''
said Professor Schlentrich.
On the jobs front, expansions in the budget eating and accommodation
market may not be at the top of the salary scale, but a job is a job. It
means entry for young people into a service industry that is slowly
gaining prestige in this country -- and the chance to move up the
ladder, whether to a more senior position, or into a franchise
opportunity.
''Hospitality and tourism are the first to feel the recession -- but
they are the first to come out of it too,'' said Professor Sclentrich.

RESTAURANTS, pubs and brewing group Whitbread is creating an
additional 630 jobs in Scotland this year which will raise its total
workforce north of Border to almost 2750.
Just five years ago, it had no Scottish retail representation. For
many years, however, it had significant involvement in drinks through
its ownership of various spirits including Long John and Black Bottle
whiskies and Beefeater Gin which were sold to the Allied Distillers
subsidiary of the now Allied Domecq.
Britain's fourth biggest brewer invested #15m in Scotland last year
and has planned an additional #19m in 1995-95 in expanding primarily its
Brewers Fayre pub chain from the existing 19 units to 24 at an
approximate cost of #1.5m each.
It is part of a #300m investment programme for each of the next two
years to help Whitbread achieve its stated objective of being the
pre-eminment retailer in drinks and eating out in the UK.
These are very much family oriented operations with Scottish director
Ken Graham saying yesterday that they have caught the imagination of the
Scottish people -- no-one else is doing it as well.
The Newhouse near Motherwell with a weekly turnover of #40,000 is the
most successful throughout the Brewers Fayre chain in the UK which at
the end of February totalled 225, now 230, pubs.
High disposable incomes in Scotland, helped by comparatively low
mortgages help explain the above average levels of profitability.
The Scottish expansion is part of an overall UK programme that will
result in almost 5100 extra employees being taken on to raise the total
to around 67,000, split fairly equally between full and part timers.
Whitbread research has found that one group in three visiting a
Brewers Fayre includes at least one child. Last year it doubled the
number of child meals sold to two million.
Chief executive Peter Jarvis was one of the first in the industry to
recognise the change in demographics with the decline in the numbers of
20-24 year olds who are high beer consumers and so began to target the
family market which had been ill-served until recently.
Investment is also going into three Hogsheads cask conditioned ale
pubs in Glasgow, Stirling and Dundee while an additional two Beefeater
restaurants are being built in Glasgow and Livingston, creating an
another 160 jobs.
There is also extension planned for the Travel Inns budget hotels with
an additional two to raise the total to 12 and a similar increase in the
number of Pizza Huts while the highly successful Thresher chain's
existing 47 off-licences will be augmented by another eight shops.
A #1.4m 36 bedroom extension is being added to the Dalmahoy Hotel and
Country Club near Edinburgh.
The news came after Whitbread announced full year pre-tax profits
increased by 17.7% to #275m with the biggest gain coming from the inns
division.

<RECORDNO>978567351</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SERGEI Baltacha, the former Soviet Union internationalist, has quit
struggling Scottish League newcomers Caledonian Thistle.
The news was announced last night after days of speculation about the
former Ipswich and St Johnstone man's future. He leaves with two years
of a three-year contract, reportedly worth #25,000 annually, to run.
Criticism of his managerial style has been mounting, not only on the
terraces but from behind the scenes, and this may have prompted his
decision. But last night, he said he had asked to be released from his
contract early for family reasons.
''I will leave a piece of my heart at this club,'' said Baltacha. ''I
appreciate the many people -- directors, players, and supporters -- who
helped me. I am sure that the club will be in a better position in the
near future and will eventually be able to make the progress it deserves
to a higher division.''
Caley Thistle vice-chairman Norman Miller said: ''We are sorry to see
Sergei go and are sure he has a distinguished career ahead of him in the
game.
''It has not been easy for the manager in the circumstances and we
greatly appreciate the commitment he has shown in laying a basis for the
future. We appreciate his reasons for going and that his family must
come first.''
Baltacha has been unhappy at the lack of money available for players
and the continuing off-the-field wrangling which leaves the merger and
Caledonian Thistle's Scottish League status still in the balance.
The club has been unable to fulfil its promise to the Scottish League
that a new stadium will be ready for the new season -- building work has
not yet begun.
Scottish League secretary Peter Donald has told them their future will
be reviewed if it is not ready for the 1996-97 season.
North football has been buzzing with speculation that Baltacha was to
be replaced by former Manchester United central defender and highly
successful Highland League manager, Steve Paterson, of Huntly. But
Paterson, who has one year of his contract to run with Huntly, says no
moves have been made for him.
Caley are also on the verge of a close season player clear-out, but
this may now be delayed until a new manager is in place.
* THE English Football Association squad for the match against the
Highland League at St Albans on May 19 is:
S Farrelly (Macclesfield), L Batty (Woking), P Webb (Kidderminster), K
Brown (Woking), A Reid (Altrincham), S Holden (Kettering), N Ashby
(Kettering), D Venables (Stevenage), R Forsyth (Kidderminster), S Stott
(Bromsgrove), M McDonald (Macclesfield), I Richardson (Dagenham &amp;
Redbridge), L May (Stafford), R Carter (Bromsgrove), D Humphreys

MILES Maclagan, who last week became the first Scottish Davis Cup
player for 25 years, made a winning debut at Craiglockhart in the LTA
Spring Satellite tournament.
Maclagan, seeded fifth, was kept on court for fully two hours by
Australian James Sekulov before winning his first-round tie 6-4, 7-6.
The Scot broke his opponent's serve in the opening game, which went to
six deuces, and then opened his first service game with two aces. But
Sekulov proved a gutsy opponent and saved a break point in the seventh
game before Maclagan won the first set with a perfect lob.
He broke his opponent again in the fifth game of the second set and
led 4-2 before Sekulov hit back to lead 40-0 on Maclagan's serve in the
eighth game and held his nerve to break back. But the Scot won the set
on a 7-4 tie-break to progress to the last 16.
Fellow-Scot Ross Matheson, who could meet Maclagan in tomorrow's
quarter-final, also had a hard work-out before beating England's Tom
Spinks 7-6, 7-5.
But the other two Scots in the men's singles went out. Wild-card entry
Kenny Wood was thrashed 6-0, 6-0 by No.6 seed Andrew Foster and
qualifier Jason Barnett lost 6-2, 6-2 to Dane Patrik Langvardt.

A PATIENT last week suggested I eat my own words. . The reason? I
suggested she take a homeopathic remedy for her eczema when apparently
10 years ago I ridiculed her for contemplating going to a homeopath. I
couldn't blame her for getting her own back. In my old age I'm finding
homeopathic medicine can be helpful. The medically-trained scientist in
me doesn't see how it can work when there is no active ingredient in
these highly diluted medicines.
Taking a teaspoonful of the Clyde at Rothesay when you've put a
tablespoonful of medicine in at Largs was how one eminent Glasgow
consultant physician described homeopathy to me as a student.
Recent evidence in the Lancet that homeopathy does improve asthma
symptoms would seem to reassure me, but I am not happy at patients who
wish it at the expense of conventional medicine. Diabetics still need
insulin, failing hearts need modern drugs, and septic gallbladder or
appendix still needs surgery.
It's a misconception that because ''herbal'' medicines are made from
nature they are safe. Some of the most lethal poisons come from natural
substances and some homeopathic medicines are indeed made from them but
they aren't just ''herbal''. Homeopathic remedies are specifically
prepared by greatly diluting compounds of known action and toxicology.
They are given to patients by matching their symptoms, characteristics,
and history to the patterns known for the remedy. Ordinary (allopathic)
medicines treat symptoms or combat didease. Homeopathic ones are rather
like immunisations; a dilution of something which in large doses would
cause the symptoms complained of.
Curiously, homeopathy is practised much more widely on the Continent
than in the UK. It has a big following in India where a consultation can
last up to three hours. If research proves it further, its popularity
may grow as it is very government friendly (cheap!). The training course
for doctors, dentists and vets at the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital is
certainly packed.

BELGIAN Bruno Thiry surprised world-championship regulars by
dominating the first day of the Tour de Corse, nicknamed the rally of
1000 corners.
He was fastest on four of yesterday's eight special stages over
Corsica's narrow, bumpy roads to lead his Ford Escort team-mate and 1993
Corsica winner, Frenchman Francois Delecour, by six seconds.
''This is the first time I have led a world-championship rally. I
don't know why I am faster,'' said a delighted Thiry in Bastia last
night.
Pre-event favourite, Didier Auriol (Toyota Celica), has won four times
here and twice finished second in the past six years, but the Frenchman
is still getting used to his last-minute replacement navigator. Last
night they were in third place.
Championship leader, Carlos Sainz from Spain, heads a tightly packed
trio of Subaru Imprezas in fifth, sixth, and seventh places. Scot Colin
McRae is seventh, two seconds behind Italian, Piero Liatti, and three
behind Sainz.
''We couldn't have wanted a better start. Colin is going well,
although the tyres are quite delicate,'' said McRae's co-driver Derek
Ringer, referring to new rules which permit only treaded tyres, instead
of better suited slicks.
Andrew Cowan's Mitsubishi Lancer team worked through Monday night to
re-prepare Andrea Aghini's practice car after the Italian crashed his
rally car during tyre testing. Aghini restarts today's second leg of six
stages in fourth place.
The 1200km rally finishes in Ajaccio tomorrow afternoon. Interim
positions after eight of 22 special stages:
1, B Thiry/S Prevot (both Belgium), Ford Escort, 1hr 38min 38sec; 2, F
Delecour/C Francois (France), Ford Escort, 1-38-44; 3, D Auriol/D
Giraudet (France), Toyota Celica, 1-39-08; 4, A Aghini/S Farnocchia

KEITH Anderson, the oldest man in the field at 38, shocked the cream
of Britain's middle distance runners yesterday when he won the four-mile
sand race, opening event in the six-day Northumberland Castles All
Terrain Marathon.
Anderson, winner of the Scottish cross-country title at Perth in
February, again had two former Scottish cross-country champions in his
wake as he scorched along Bamburgh beach in 18min 01sec.
Chris Robison finished third (18-11), six seconds behind England's
Martin Jones, with Robison's IBM Spango Valley clubmate, Tommy Murray,
twelfth, in 18-42. Steve Cram, the 34-year-old former world mile
record-holder, lasted just two miles, dropping out with a calf muscle
injury.
Kenyan Catherine Kirui won the women's race in 20-36.
Anderson, who declared for England after having been overlooked by
Scotland, earned $500 from the overall pot of $52,000. Robison won $300.
But the runners have to stay the course, 26.2 miles, over all six races
on varying surfaces, to collect in full.
Greenock's Murray, thrice national cross-country champion, was
embarrassed after an oversight which cost him dearly. ''I packed all my
gear, but managed to leave my racing flats in the hotel,'' said Murray.
''I was left with no option but to run in spikes. Although the surface
was hard-packed, it was like clawing a sand pit with a rake.''
The event continues tonight with a 5000 metres race on the track, at
Hexham. Several younger competitors were surprised to learn that the
surface would not be all-weather. ''Many of them -- and most of the
girls -- were asking what a cinder track is,'' said Murray. Result:
Men: 1, K Anderson (Bingley) 18mins 01secs; 2 M, Jones (Horwich)
18-05; 3, C Robson (IBM Spango Valley) 18-11. Women: 1, C Kiruri (Kenya)
20-36; 2, F Roba (Eth) 20-47; 3, A Hulley (Leeds) 20-50.

IT is one of the ironies of diplomacy that celebrations marking the
50th anniversary of one war's end provide the chance to try to prevent
another from escalating out of control. The impressive collection of
world leaders in London for the VE-Day celebrations should include
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. A ''convenient opportunity'' to ram
home to the President the dangers he was incurring for his people, as
well as for his neighbours, by his actions, according to Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd, yesterday.
The Croat attack on the Serb enclave in Western Slavonia on Tuesday
led to their capital, Zagreb, being shelled, to deaths and injuries
among civilians. It is possible that the cease-fire agreed yesterday,
after the intervention of the UN special representative, Mr Yasushi
Akashu, will defuse the present crisis. But only time can tell. The
history of the disintegration of Yugoslavia is littered with failed
cease-fire agreements.
There is plenty of intense diplomatic activity going on, although it
does seem rather lacking in focus. Lord Owen, co-chairman with the
United Nations' representative, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, of the
International Conference on the former Yugoslavia, has invited President
Tudjman, the self-styled president of the Croatian Serbs, Mr Milan
Martic, and other Serb leaders to come to Geneva for talks lasting ''as
long as it takes''.
The re-emergence of the two mediators, whose role had been largely
sidelined with the creation at the beginning of last year of the
international Contact Group made up of Britain, Russia, France, Germany,
and the United States to try to solve the problem of Bosnia, was
welcomed yesterday in London. The Serbian President, Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, has been restrained in his response to this latest crisis and
Lord Owen believes Belgrade has no wish, if it can be humanly avoided,
to get involved.
In London the political directors of the various foreign ministries
belonging to the Contact Group decide tomorrow whether there should be a
meeting at ministerial level, and Mr Hurd has exerted personal pressure
on Germany to use its influence with President Tudjman. Mr Hurd revealed
in response to Commons questions that he had personally impressed on the
Germans the importance of everyone playing their part in the control of
the border between the Serbs and the Bosnian Serbs.
One complication is that the existence of Croatia has been recognised
by the European Union. A country has a right to defend its own integrity
and the Serb enclave, created when Croatia broke with Yugoslavia in
1991, threatens that integrity. The European Union decided yesterday to
continue talks on a trade and co-operation deal with the Croatian
Government, although Britain and France believe they should have been
suspended.
The future of the United Nations peacekeeping force could depend on
the outcome of this weekend's presidential elections. The French Prime
Minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, has said it will be for France's next
government to decide whether French peacekeeping troops should be
withdrawn. The UN peacekeeping mission is under strain, but has not yet
reached the point of collapse. Any agreement on withdrawal of national
contingents is not yet in sight, but once one of the participants became
serious about withdrawal, the others will follow. Contingency plans for
pulling out have been made, and it would only come about should
full-scale war erupt in the Balkans renderng the UN's role obsolete.
Mr Hurd said there could be circumstances in which the risk to British
troops might become such that they would have to be withdrawn, but they
were not there yet. And he warned that those concerned with ordering the
fighting should not take the presence of British troops, or the UN
troops, for granted. This latest fighting in Croatia started just as the
four-month, albeit largely ignored, truce in neighbouring Bosnia came to
an end and is one more reminder of just how volatile the region is. The
Balkan Problem bedevilled Europe at the beginning of the century, and is
doing so again as it heads to its close.

COVENTRY City hope to sign England midfield player Paul Gascoigne from
Lazio. Highfield Road chairman Bryan Richardson claims: ''We are serious
about this. Our average gates of 15,000 mean there are 8000 empty seats
at every home match. If Paul came here he could fill the ground and that
would be worth #1.6m a year to this club.
''People may raise their eyebrows at our interest but they probably
did so when Southampton signed Kevin Keegan from Hamburg.''
Manager Ron Atkinson, who has been on the look out for a major signing
to demonstrate Coventry's ambitions, confirmed the club's inquiry.
''Paul is the type of personality I want at this club,'' said
Atkinson. ''We have asked to be kept informed of the situation at
Lazio.''
* THE struggle to avoid the drop from the English Premiership gathered
pace last night with several threatened clubs in action.
Cup finalist Everton were shocked after 29 minutes when Chelsea's Paul
Furlong shot the visitors ahead, but nine minutes later Andy Hinchcliffe
levelled the score.
After the break, Gary Ablett put the Goodison Park club in front, but
that lead was short-lived, Chelsea's David Hopkins again levelling the
match after 51 minutes. With 20 minutes remaining Daniel Amokachi put
Everton back in front, but Furlong then added his second to make it 3-3.
In Birmingham, Aston Villa's Ugo Ehiogu brought the home fans to their
feet when he opened the scoring against Manchester City, themselves not
out exactly clear of the relegation zone. But City's German striker Uwe
Rosler netted to tie the scores at 1-1.
There was plenty of early action at St James's Park, where goals from
Keith Gillespie and Darren Peacock put Newcastle 2-0 up against Spurs
inside 10 minutes. But those reversals galvanised the London side, and
they were 3-2 up inside 30 minutes through goals from Nick Barmby,
Jurgen Klinsmann, and Darren Anderton.
But the action didn't stop there for just before the hour mark
Newcastle keeper Pavel Srnicek was sent off after having brought down
Barmby in penalty area. Mike Hooper came on as substitute and saved
Jurgen Klinsmann's penalty.
But the home fans had something to shout about after 70 minutes when
Peter Beardsley scored to make it 3-3. Spurs' Colin Calderwood was sent
off for a second bookable offence.

SCOTLAND'S misery continued in the European Under-21 championship
qualifying tournaments yesterday. This time it was the men who were
beaten, going down 1-0 against Italy in Genoa and they now join the
women on the European scrapheap at junior level.
This is a far cry from 18 months ago when both Scottish sides
contested the finals of the World Cup but, unlike the women, the men's
problems are not so critical.
They were always going to struggle through the unavailability of nine
members of their training squad through illness and examinations. They
should regain their standing as they have the talent available to make
an impact at international level but, unfortunately, it means Scotland
will be in the international wilderness for three years at this level.
Scotland, however, played well against the Italians. Harry Coles,
their manager, said: ''This was our best performance of the tournament.
We matched the Italians all the way but in a game of few goalmouth
incidents they got the single break in the match when Tirilli scored the
winner 11 minutes from time.
''We couldn't have asked more from the players and the performances of
Michael Leonard, James McBrain, and Euan Miller were outstanding.''
The depths to which the women have sunk was reflected in their final
group match. They took the lead after six minutes through Gillian Soutar
but squandered a series of chances to allow Poland to force a 1-1 draw
with an equaliser six minutes from time.
After having dropped that point Scotland now prop up their group
because of their inferior goal difference and in their first
ratification match tomorrow they will now play Italy. Results:
Women. Group A -- Holland 6, Finland 0; Ireland 1, Italy 0. Group B --
Ukraine 4, Czech Republic 3; Scotland 1, Poland 1.
Men -- Scotland 0, Italy 1; Gibraltar 1 Portual 0.

* GET on your bike: that's the message from Glasgow Cycling Campaign.
To help you get started they are organising a gentle eight-mile bike
ride through Glasgow's parks on Sunday, May 14.
Pedal the Parks family bike ride is free, includes jugglers,
stilt-walkers and musicians. So, if you want to get fit this summer what
better way than to start cycling. As organiser Neil McDonald points out:
''The event is a relaxing, safe introduction to the benefits of cycling.
We want as many people as possible to turn up, tune in, and ride off.''
The ride starts at 11am from Glasgow Green (next to the People's
Palace) and finishes in Bellahouston Park.
* PLAYING with clay is therapeutic. To find out more then take part in
a series of one-day workshops organised by Project Ability, a registered
charity, in Glasgow from May 16 to June 13.
Open to both handicapped and able-bodied, Ceramic Workshops offer the
opportunity to use and experiment with clay. What's more, it's free. For

MOTHERWELL will mark their last home game of the season against
Kilmarnock on Saturday by opening their new #1.75m north stand.
Safety officers yesterday passed the stand, which will hold 2200, and
include 200 executive box places, bringing the capacity at Fir Park to
13,800.
To mark the occasion, the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons, Ann
Taylor, will hand over a cheque on behalf of the Football Ground
Improvement Trust for around half the cost.
* MANCHESTER United have hit back at allegations that they poached
three promising youngsters from clubs with whom they were training.
United have been reported to the Football Association after having
signed three 16-year-olds -- strikers Andrew Wright and David Brown, who
had been with Leeds and Oldham respectively, and defender Matthew Wicks,
who had been at Arsenal.
* THERE will be no public sale of tickets to Celtic fans for the
Scottish Cup final against Airdrie.
The bulk of the briefs will go to the club's 18,500 season ticket
holders, and they will get only one ticket each.
Season ticket holders will be able to get their brief for Celtic's
first Scottish Cup final for five years when they go on sale at Parkhead
next week.
The details are -- Wednesday May 10: East Stand, #17. Family Section,
Adults #16, Children #2. Thursday May 11 -- North Stand, #20. Friday May
12 -- West Stand, #17.
Season-ticket holders must produce voucher 47 and the sale will take
place on each of the above days only at Parkhead between 10am and 4pm.
Anyone who cannot make it to the ground can make a postal application
up to May 12. They must include a blank cheque, an SAE, and voucher
No.47.
Meanwhile, Airdrie put their share of the final's tickets on sale
today. But until Saturday, May 13, only season-ticket holders,
shareholders, Diamonds Club members, and Junior Diamonds will be able to
buy them.
* TOTTENHAM were yesterday cleared of any improper payments in
connection with their signing of Romanian midfield player Ilie
Dumitrescu, from Steaua Bucharest.
Spurs have always maintained that they paid #2.72m for Dumitrescu and
yesterday Steaua admitted that they had declared only #1.6m of the fee
to the Romanian authorities, with the balance going to the player and
foreign go-betweens.
* SERGEI Baltacha, the former Soviet Union internationalist, has quit
as manager of struggling Scottish League newcomers Caledonian Thistle.

NEIL Simpson, secretary of the PGA Scottish region, has confirmed that
Andrew Coltart, the holder, and Dean Robertson, third last year in his
first professional appearance, will play in the Tartan Special Scottish
Professional Championship from May 18 to 21 over Dalmahoy's East course.
Adam Hunter also will compete in the event, which is the last under
the existing three-year contract. However, this sponsor and the Tartan
Tour will begin discussions soon on a new agreement.
Coltart and Hunter are challenging to represent Scotland in the
Dunhill and World Cups and have made solid starts to the season, passing
up the #550,000 Spanish Open for the #65,000 Scottish event.
Nevertheless today and tomorrow, 220 players will compete for 66
places, to join the championship's 66 exempt players. They now include
Simon Yates, whose recent victory in one of the Volvo China Tour events
has been recognised with a special late dispensation from
pre-qualifying.
Coltart should gain a full exemption into the Open Championship by
finishing in the first 20 in the Order of Merit after the Volvo PGA
Championship, but although Hunter, on #69,000, also is well placed, the
player in twentieth position, Anders Forsbrand, is only #22,000 behind.
The absence of such as Stephen McAllister, Paul Lawrie, the 1992
winner, and Gary Orr, runner-up last year, is easy to understand. They
are wallowing in the lower reaches of the Order of Merit and a
succession of tournaments worth between #500,000 and #900,000 looms.
* HARRY McCaw, a 62-year-old Northern Ireland businessman who has
twice been captain of the Royal County Down club at Newcastle, has been
nominated the 1995-96 captain of the Royal and Ancient Club.
Educated at Glenalmond College, he is a former member of the general
and amateur status committees and is currently on the rules of golf
committee.
* RICHARD Muckart moved to the top of the leaderboard yesterday in the
race for the top handicap prize in the Royal and Ancient Golf Club's
Spring medal meeting at St Andrews. Leading scores:
65 -- R D Muckart (8).
69 -- C J Hue Williams (14).

DINO Baggio's goal after five minutes and inspired goalkeeping from
Luca Bucci secured a 1-0 win for Parma against Juventus in an
all-Italian UEFA Cup final first leg yesterday.
Baggio netted after Gianfranco Zola's perfectly-weighted pass had
split Juventus's makeshift defence -- missing four first-team regulars
through injury and suspension.
The early goal committed Juventus to attack in search of an equaliser,
and it took two superb saves from Bucci in the second-half to deny the
visitor's a precious away goal.
First, after 52 minutes, Italy's second-choice keeper dived
full-length to turn a long-range shot from substitute Giancarlo Marocchi
around a post. Twelve minutes later Bucci showed fine reflexes to parry
a first-time volley from Gianluca Vialli.
Parma, last season's beaten Cup-winner's Cup finalists, relied on
counter-attacks in their search for a second goal, with Faustino
Asprilla a constant thorn in Juve's defence.
In 51 minutes, the Colombian met a free kick from Zola with a header
which Rampulla did well to stop on the line.
Six players were booked and, with Parma's Luigi Apolloni, Gabriele
Pin, and Nestor Sensini suspended for the second leg, Juventus must
fancy their chances of overcoming the single goal deficit in two weeks.
* COVENTRY have revealed an interest in signing Paul Gascoigne from
Lazio. City chairman Bryan Richardson said: ''We are serious. Our
average gates of 15,000 mean there are 8000 empty seats at every home
match. If Paul came here he could fill the ground and that would be
worth #1.6m a year to this club.''
Manager Ron Atkinson, who has been on the lookout for a major signing,
said: ''Paul is the type of personality I want at this club. We have
asked to be kept informed of the situation at Lazio.''
* EUROPEAN Cup finalist Ajax took a step towards retaining the Dutch
title with a 3-0 success against Maastricht last night with goals from
Finidi George, Marc Overmars, and Edgar Davids.
* PARIS St Germain defeated Bastia 2-0 yesterday in the final of the
French League Cup.
The Parisians took the lead after 22 minutes when captain Alain Roche
headed home, and the Brazilian, Rai, sealed Bastia's fate seven minutes
from time when he added the second.
St Germain could now land a unique cup double when they play
Strasbourg in the final of the French Cup in 10 days time, also in the
Parc des Princes.

HILARY Thacker could be a character in a Joanna Trollope novel. She
lives in a tiny village near Kendal, Cumbria. She lies low -- people
whisper about her occupation. She dare not hang washing out to dry: her
unusual line in smalls might upset the neighbours. Thacker is a belly
dancer. ''The Lake District is very conservative -- I know couples who
think pizza is too foreign. One old man said to me, 'they'll have a
Bedouin camp here next','' she says.
Not surprisingly, perhaps, Thacker finds the bulk of her business
north of the Border. She clocks up 20 hours a week commuting to
Edinburgh and Glasgow. Two or three nights a week she stays over in the
capital (''it can be very lonely'') where she teaches six classes and
performs every Saturday night in a tented Indian/Arabic restaurant
(Gulnars in Leith). And once a month she brings belly dancing to
Pollokshaws.
While Scottish women can't seem to get enough of quivering thighs and
shimmying hips, Thacker takes only one class a week in England. So are
the pleasures of the eightsome reel tame compared with drawing a figure
of eight in the air with your bosom? Or are the women of Caledonia
repressed? (Some students admit to telling their husbands they're off to
keep fit.)
Thacker, who shares her life with an unlikely looking fire-eater with
a taste for tweedy jackets, offers several theories for why Scotland is
turning into a realm of exotic voluptuousness. First, most of her
bookings stem from female executives in Glasgow and Edinburgh's arts and
leisure departments. They invite her to teach council employees and they
arrange for public appearances. ''They even pay for Egyptian musicians
to come up by train from London. At the Glasgow show last year we all
appeared in the international dance tent'' (to be repeated this summer).
She believes Scots enjoy a bit of extravaganza (''remember that
Hogmanay party in Princes Street -- the English would never do that!'').
Scots females are pretty gutsy -- for belly dancing you have to be.
''You're bound to get flak from neighbours and family. People will think
you're weird, maybe even a prostitute.'' And our build may lend itself
to the sensually evocative movements of Thacker's chosen art. ''It's a
powerful dance which needs strength.''
Trouble is, it's not physical, but erotic power which people tend to
associate with terpsichorean tums. At the low end of the market, ladies
who perform this art as old as the Pharaohs and more ancient than Islam,
are dancer-strippers; they perform burlesques in sleazy tavernas and
proceed to satisfy the desires they arouse. Variations on the theme are
danced at fertility rites from Brazil to the South Seas.
But Thacker's expertise is totally divorced from what is practised,
without technique or skill, by women of dubious repute. She was inspired
by leading exponent Suraya Hilal, an Egyptian-born dancer who learned
her craft traditionally, within the family circle. She studied in the US
and works to promote the classical choreography of Raqs Sharqi -- a
beautiful and ancient form of Egyptian dance which combines elements of
Indian temple dancing with gipsy, flamenco and the vigorous movements of
Africa. It is this balance, subtle but lively -- uniting sensuality
control and spirituality -- which Thacker passes on to hundreds of
Salome wannabees.
But some remain sceptical. Thacker recently asked her local verger to
book the village hall for a one-off workshop. No problem, he said. Then
the vicar phoned. ''Is it therapeutic or do you enjoy it?'' he wanted to
know. Thacker replied that it can be good fun. ''Well, if you enjoy it,
you can't do it here,'' came the swift response.
Thacker makes no apology for the enjoyment factor. Nor do her pupils,
who tend to come from the chattering classes. Eileen Kennedy, a
horticulturalist, is on her third term and finds it hugely relaxing.
''Some of the choreography is almost trance-like.'' Six years ago,
Kennedy came to Scotland from Australia where belly dancing is very
popular. ''It's the ultimate girlie thing to do, so feminine, a
celebration of the female body.''
Kirsten Garner, a post-graduate student, likes the scope for personal
expression. ''It's a dance style not set down in tablets of stone. And
it's very good for tummy muscles.'' One grandmother comes along with her
daughter and grand-daughter.
Basically, belly dancing -- promoted by alternative therapists as
beneficial for menstrual troubles, cystitis, backache, and depression --
involves mastering 10 moves. Half are sinuous (spirals, infinity signs
and circles, for instance); the rest can be summed up as wobbly. But if
you think wobbly means merely shoogly, think again. This reporter joined
a beginners' class where we learned how to do ''hits''.
''This is an easy wobbly move,'' Hilary explained to us. ''Jerk the
hips. The more sudden the jerk the more wobble you get. Your backside
will wobble too. Try two wobbles each hip. Keep your knees bent, the
more bent the more wobble . . .''
We saw ''the camel'' (undulating midriff) and the ''pitcher of water''
(arms above head as if carrying said article). Oh, and a tip for
beginners: don't try to look thin by holding your stomach in -- you end
up with one heck of a stitch.
Allow a year to become proficient; meantime you'll have lots of laughs
and develop muscles and poise you never dreamed of. Men can join in too.
''In the Arab world every member of the family belly dances,'' says
Thacker, who has visited dozens of Egyptian homes. ''Men do the same
moves and somehow it looks macho.'' For Arabs, what Americans used to
call ''the abdomen dance'' and the French ''La Danse Du Ventre'', is
simply a way of life.
But for how long? Currently there is a crackdown on belly dancing in
Muslim countries -- several celebrated Egyptian dancers have received
death threats.
Raqs Sharqi is frowned on since the use of the human body as an
instrument for artistic expression is seen as too close to nature to
symbolise godliness; yet its lyrical dips and curves of line seem to
correspond exactly to Islam's ideas on beauty and harmony.
Things are looking up in Cumbria, however. The publican in Thacker's
village invited her to dance for the locals at New Year. Everyone turned
out; when she took the floor, the pub was packed. I bet you could have
heard a hip drop.

A MAN suffered serious injuries yesterday when he was mauled by two
leopards after climbing into their zoo enclosure ''to make friends with
them''.
Carl Hogben, 25, staggered covered in blood into the zoo shop and told
staff he had been attacked.
Mr Hogben, who had deep claw injuries to his arms, chest, and private
parts, then collapsed at Marwell Zoo, near Winchester, Hampshire.
He was taken to the Royal Hampshire County Hospital at Winchester,
where his condition was described as ''stable''.
Zoo director John Knowles said that Mr Hogben, of Hampton, Middlesex,
had been visiting the zoo on his own.
''He suddenly appeared in the shop covered in blood and said he had
been mauled by the leopards,'' said Mr Knowles.
''He told us he had crossed the barrier to get closer to the leopards
in their cages. They got a claw hold on him and he was very badly
injured.''
Mr Knowles said the cage and safety barrier for the Persian leopards
had been in place at the zoo since it opened in 1972.
The leopards, a female and a male, are kept in adjoining cages.
Mr Knowles added: ''We have never before had an incident like this --
but in the end it is impossible to protect everybody from their own
foolishness.
''Earlier this man had been seen stroking a giraffe, and it seems he
thought he could move on to the leopards.
''He told us: 'I wanted to make friends with the leopards'.''
He said the man had crossed a 3ft 6ins wooden and wire fence and went
right up to the cage, which is about 4ft away from the barrier.
''It appears he went up to the corner where the two cages join and was
clawed by both the leopards.
''These animals are very, very efficient predators. They jumped at him
and their claws got caught in his clothes.''
The park, which has been open 23 years, has the South of England's
largest collection of big cats. It receives 320,000 visitors a year.

SCOTLAND defender Colin Calderwood of Tottenham Hotspur, and Newcastle
keeper Pavel Srnicek were sent off in an amazing Premiership clash at St
James' Park. And Jurgen Klinsmann even missed a penalty in the 3-3 draw.
Trailing 2-0 after 10 minutes, Spurs turned the tables with three
goals in four minutes, to lead 3-2. But Newcastle snatched a point with
a Peter Beardsley strike 20 minutes from the end.
Keith Gillespie and defender Darren Peacock had United in front,
before Nick Barmby and then Klinsmann equalised. And with the St James'
Park crowd already stunned, Anderton lashed in a brilliant 25-yard shot
which found the top right corner for Tottenham's third goal.
The second half was equally dramatic with Newcastle reduced to 10 men
after 55 minutes. Srnicek was shown the red card by referee Dermot
Gallagher for bringing down Barmby as the Tottenham man went clear
inside the box from David Howell's superb pass.
As Klinsmann waited to take the penalty, Newcastle manager Kevin
Keegan brought off Ruel Fox and sent on substitute keeper Mike Hooper,
whose first act was to save Klinsmann's penalty.
Nine minutes later, Calderwood, booked after 52 minutes for a foul on
Beardsley, was sent off for a late tackle on Watson.
Two minutes later, Newcastle were level when Watson lifted a ball over
the Spurs defence and, as substitute Sol Campbell hesitated, Beardsley
stole the bouncing ball from him and crashed home a right foot shot from
16 yards.
Graham Stuart was at the centre of an FA Cup injury scare for Everton
last night. The midfielder was having x-rays on possible cracked ribs
after a freak collision with team-mate Andy Hinchcliffe in the 3-3 draw
with Chelsea.
Manager Joe Royle, who will lead his team out against Manchester
United at Wembley on May 20, said: ''He's in some distress. He's having
trouble breathing and the chances are he has cracked ribs.
Royle, whose side are still battling against relegation, was annoyed
at the result.''When you have scored three goals at home you should have
three points. We made hard work of it. The other results went our way
tonight, and I think we will need one win in three games to be safe.''
Crystal Palace chief Alan Smith could only say: ''It was Matthew le
Tissier versus us,'' after the Londoners slipped closer to relegation
with a 3-1 defeat at Southampton.The England outcast scored one, could
claim another, and set up the third for Alan Ball's Saints.
West Ham picked up another valuable point in their 0-0 battle to beat
the drop after hanging on for 27 minutes with 10 men following the
dismissal of Martin Allen against Queens Park Rangers. And Aston Villa
were reasonably happy with their 1-1 home draw with Manchester City.
Middlesbrough won the first division championship when rivals Bolton
could draw only 1-1 at Stoke.

OBAN Camanachd could face their biggest test of the season so far on
Saturday minus four key players. They will be without the suspended
Gavin Blainey and Fraser Inglis, as well as the injured Dave McCuish.
And now Stephen Jamieson also is injured and struggling to make the
line-up for the second Camanachd Cup semi-final against Newtonmore at
Fort William.
Newtonmore have surprised many, but their track record in this event
means that they must be treated with respect. Their difficulty, however,
is in front of goal.
An all-Badenoch Cup final against Kingussie, the first since 1987, is
a possibility, and if a team had to win the Camanachd Cup the hard way,
then Camanachd qualify by way of their recent trials and tribulations.
They also will have to play two of their next three matches, all cup
finals now, without a key player who has been suspended. Dave Borthwick
has been banned after an ordering-off offence.
The Camanachd Association's Disciplinary Committee also have taken a
stiff line against several other players. Allan Wilson (Taynuilt) has
been suspended until January 1 for an ordering off offence, and Lovat's
Martin White receives a seven-match ban.
Kyles' President John Patterson has been barred from the touchline
until September 30. Patterson, until recently chairman of the referees'
committee, has been suspended as a referee for verbally abusing another
official after a recent game at Kyles.
Skye's future in the new national league is at stake on Saturday when
they entertain Fort William. Skye need a point, if not two, to put
pressure on Glenurquhart. Both the Glen and Skye have 12 points with
their final games to play.

IN 1895 a 56-horse carousel built at Kings Lynn in Norfolk was hailed
as Britain's biggest. Exactly a century later, the one newly constructed
for Loudoun Castle Park has beaten it.
Based on the same design but a full foot wider in diameter, this
glorious example of funfair excellence carries the legend ''Happy Days
Are Here Again At Loudoun'' and has already become a colourful talisman
at the park.
Most people apparently take at least two rides in the course of a
visit so it is clearly going to be worth the #300,000 investment.
The fun park also has a 55ft helter skelter, a suitably scary ghost
train, a bouncy castle, teenager jets, cup and saucer ride, pirate boat,
and orbiters. A new monster water attraction is also hinted at, perhaps
being available in the course of the summer. And there is a full-scale
adventure playground and a pets' corner where youngsters are allowed to
play with the animals.
A series of paddocks means families can get to know all about Scottish
breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, ponies, and goats. Two road trains are
constantly on the go, with free guided tours of the park offering a look
at a group of red deer among the other attractions.
The rose garden to the south of the castle has been restored to its
original glory and visitors can see the famous Ayrshire Rose in the
setting where it was created.
One of the most dramatic renovations at the park is the two-storey
coachhouse which now houses the restaurant, gift shop and museum. Anyone
visiting this splendid complex and courtyard should make a point of
seeing the before-and-after pictures on display inside: the coachhouse
was an overgrown, roofless ruin only a year ago.
Virtually all of the work has been carried out by local contractors,
if not from the Irvine Valley at least from Glasgow, and Peter Clery is
proud of this and of the 50 jobs provided for local people.
His team consists of Jim Miller, who has the title steward of Loudoun
Park; head of reception Karen McCafferty; head of retail Mary Wallace;
Colin Herdman and Doug McAvoy who are in charge of the fun park; and
Douglas Gray, who is responsible for farm and estate. Elaine Leslie is
in charge of the catering.
Loudoun Castle Park opened its doors to visitors on April 8, and 900
came on Easter Sunday alone. It had its official opening on Friday,
April 28, by Lord James Douglas Hamilton, Minister of State at the
Scottish Office and offers special rates to school and coach parties.

AN AUSTRALIAN side of rare discipline and commitment became the first
team to defeat West Indies in a Caribbean series for 22 years with
victory by an innings and 53 runs in the fourth Test in Kingston,
Jamaica, yesterday.
Mark Taylor's team dismissed the home side for 213 in their second
innings to finish the Test with almost a day and a half to spare, and
inflict the first series defeat on the West Indies in 15 years.
West Indies resumed at 63 for three but four wickets each by Paul
Reiffel and Shane Warne ensured Australia were not required to bat again
on the Sabina Park wicket.
When the last West Indies wicket fell at 2.45pm local time, Australia
had regained the Frank Worrell Trophy for the first time in 19 years --
and nine attempts.
They also inflicted the first Test series loss on West Indies in 27
series and two one-off Tests since 1979-80 and became only the seventh
Australian team to beat them by an innings.
Australia were comprehensively the better side in the series despite
losing bowlers Damien Fleming and Craig McDermott through injury.
They won the first Test by 10 wickets, played the better cricket in

Cape Town, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela today accused Zulu coalition partner
Mangosuthu Buthelezi of fomenting violence and threatened to amend South
Africa's constitution to cut his financial lifeline.
''If any party or leader threatens the lives of human beings, it is my
duty as President and head of this government to act decisively and that
is what I am going to do,'' Mandela told parliament.
Departing from the prepared text of a speech closing two days of
debate on his presidency, Mandela said more than 20,000 blacks had died
in Buthelezi's KwaZulu-Natal powerbase province in 10 years.
''A reduction of tensions in that province is one of the most urgent
priorities faced by politicians,'' he said.
Mandela accused Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party of threatening to
overthrow the year-old constitution guiding South Africa from white rule
to democracy.
''Chief Buthelezi has made a public call to Zulus to rise against the
central government and has said if we do not get the right to
self-determination it is not worth being alive.''--Reuter.

OPPOSITION to a possible merger or takeover of Wallets Marts is
mounting throughout south-west Scotland. Farmers and shareholders are
preparing to fight to keep the company independent after the #1m
takeover bid from James Craig.
After a week of speculation and advice to Wallets shareholders not to
take action at present over the #8.50 a share offer from James Craig,
joint venture talks between Wallets and Harrison and Hetherington, and
an indication of interest from Thomson Roddick and Laurie, shareholders
now seem set to reject all three suitors.
Three years ago they threw out a board recommendation for a merger
with TRL after talks. The latest approach came in a letter to the 369
Wallets shareholders from TRL. It said it was considering its position
with a view to making an offer for the shared capital of the company.
This week Wallets' directors have been assessing the situation and
gauging the opinion of the farmers. It appears their attitude is
hardening, with a growing feeling that the firm should continue on its
own.
William McTaggart of McTaggart Bros said angrily: ''There is no reason
for a takeover or merger. If the present board can't run the company
then they should step down. It would be a disaster for the town and the
area if Wallets was taken over or disappeared.''
He added that he had not found one shareholder or farmer in favour of
the changes on the cards.
This view was echoed by Robert Graham of Irelandton, Twynholm. He
said: ''I feel Wallets should remain as it is. It is ready to grow, and
the farmers in this area need the competition of an independent market.
''We don't want to be taken over and if it had gone ahead with an
offer of just over #1m it would have been the sale of the century.''
Richard Bleazard of Glenjaan, Moniaive, one of the biggest Wallets
shareholders, said: ''The market is running well now and trade is
improving with larger entries at sales. We need Wallets in the area and
I don't want to see it being merged or taken over.''

A CHANGE of policy by the Norwegian Government on the question of
over-production of salmon means the Scottish Affairs Committee report on
market conditions in the industry in this country has been overtaken by
events, according to the Scottish Salmon Growers' Association.
Chief executive William Crowe said: ''It is unfortunate that since the
committee visited Norway in January there has been a decided change of
policy by the Norwegian industry and government.
''Eight weeks after giving evidence the Norwegians realised that
marketing alone would not avert the problem of their over-production.
They have taken emergency measures to restrict output and their
government declared it would provide legislation to establish producer
organisations.''
The Scottish industry has also favoured the introduction of producer
organisations which would operate through setting limits on every
member's placement of smolts. Non-members would also have to come under
the organisations' discipline to make the policy workable.
The Scottish Affairs Committee expressed reservations about the
potential impact of producer organisations which it described as
''anti-competitive''. It argued such organisations could use their
powers to impose significant costs and restrictions on fish farms, which
might be seeking to expand and to exploit the potential economies of
scale or other market opportunities.
Mr Crowe welcomed the call from the committee for the Scottish Office
to take a lead when legitimate Scottish interests were threatened by
unfair trade practices.
The committee had suggested that a speedy approach should be made to
the European Commission on implementing minimum import prices when
market prices dictated that such action was necessary.

<TEXT>
FORMER Scottish NFU president Sandy Inverarity has come under attack
from the current NFU leadership for remarks he made last week suggesting
the Scottish union was not as well tuned into the changing agricultural
scene as its English counterpart, writes ROBERT ROSS.
He was speaking at the annual meeting of the Scottish Society for Crop
Research at Invergowrie, near Dundee.
In a letter to Mr Inverarity, who is chairman of the Scottish
Agricultural College, the Scottish president John Ross said: ''Prior to
your widely reported remarks the college seems to have kept clear of the
political discussion on the future direction of the Common Agricultural
Policy. If you feel this is an appropriate subject for SAC I think you
would earn more respect if you make a positive contribution to thinking
on this important subject.''
Mr Ross pointed out that the union had had a lengthy debate and had
come to the conclusion that the principles of the reformed CAP should be
defended.
''Ahead of us there are a range of political, economic and trade
factors which will put pressure on EU agricultural support systems. That
is well known but nobody thinks the CAP is going to disappear in the
next few years. Meantime, the best action Scottish farmers can take is
to invest to improve their competitive position and back the union's
efforts to encourage progress in the development of quality marketing
structures.''
Mr Ross included in his letter a note of appreciation for the SAC's
input to the union's Energy and Industrial Cropping Group which backs up
the NFU cereals committee's wide ranging work in that area.

FIRST there was the jab in the arm, then there was the lump of sugar,
and polio, in the developed world at least, was all but conquered. Until
then, at least until the late 1950s, infantile paralysis still cast the
bogeyman's shadow over the lives of adults and children alike.
As an impressionable child I emerged from a swim one summer in the
Lido at Dunoon feeling a bit stiff from the cold and became convinced,
briefly, that this was it, I'd caught it. Tony Gould wasn't so lucky. It
wasn't his imagination when polio struck him at the age of 20 while he
was doing his National Service in Hong Kong.
The story of the war against polio has all the ingredients of an epic
drama -- a public panic in the face of epidemic, the involvement of one
of the most powerful men of the century, the emergence of quack cures,
and the rivalry of the serious medicine men in their quest for a
vaccine.
Most of all there is the human tragedy. Researching the history of the
disease in North America, Gould came across Jean Johnson, who was 11 at
the time of a severe epidemic in the Pittsburgh area and caught the
disease at a Girl Scout camp.
She was taken to the local children's hospital and put on what, she
later discovered, was the last available iron lung -- ''They didn't have
one for the child that came in the door after me, and she died''.
Gould's description of the New York epidemic of 1916 is a frightening
reminder of what can happen to a population gripped by a plague they
can't understand, and in the face of which they are impotent -- whole
areas quarantined, cordons and road blocks, children confined to their
rooms for long periods.
North America, and Scandinavia, have been the worst sufferers from the
scourge of polio over the past hundred years -- it took the death of a
prominent footballer, Jeff Hall, to galvanise the public in Britain into
accepting vaccination on a mass scale.
Gould's own experience is more of a footnote in his history of polio
-- he was left with weakened legs but went on to resume his education
and carve a career as a radio producer, writer, husband, and father.
His was a one-off case -- there was no epidemic at the time -- which
perhaps illustrates one of the disease's perverse tendencies. Polio has
gained a reputation as a scourge of the middle-classes in developed
countries, particularly among adults -- they are less likely to have
been brought up with a sensible modicum of grubbiness, where exposure at
an early age can confer immunity without causing the disease.
The figures who dominate this book are the most famous polio victim in
history, Franklin D Roosevelt, and his law partner, Basil O'Connor, who
continued FDR's crusade against polio after the President's death; and
the two men whose names are synonymous with polio vaccine, Jonas Salk
and Albert Sabin.
It is a rude awakening to discover that for years the Warm Springs
rehabilitation centre in Georgia established by Roosevelt was run for
years on segregated lines -- a separate centre was established for
blacks -- a fact of Southern life with which even FDR had to connive
with.
Also slightly disillusioning is the bitterness which separated the two
vaccine rivals -- Sabin the establishment-backed figure determined to
persevere with a live-virus vaccine until it could be proven safe, Salk
the outsider who got in first with his killed-virus version.
The live-virus camp were handicapped by some disastrous results from
experiments in the 1930s, so the Salk vaccine was the first to be
endorsed, in a blaze of publicity -- thus threatening the chances of
Sabin's research receiving continued support.
But it was Sabin who finally won this tortoise-and-hare struggle,
after conducting a huge field trial in the Soviet Union. It was
something he might not have dared, or been permitted, to attempt in the
US, but it worked. His vaccine was judged more effective, one reason
being that the attenuated virus can spread among the unvaccinated and
protect them too.
One of the earliest recorded cases is that of Sir Walter Scott, who
contracted the disease at the age of 18 months. It is now the World
Health Organisation's aim to eradicate polio completely by the year
2000, as they have already done with smallpox. That remains to be seen;
in the meantime the polio generation -- the generation of children and
young people who were born just too soon to get the vaccine -- have to
look forward to an uncertain old age which, it has recently been
recognised, might re-awaken the symptoms they have struggled to
overcome.
This so-called post-polio syndrome calls into question the belief that
once you have ''recovered'' from polio its debilitating effects will no
longer continue.

<HEADLINE>Keep calm about quotas, dairymen told at Ayr show</HEADLINE>

Dairy farmers should regard their milk quota in the same way as they
did buying a tractor, David Douglas, agricultural manager of the
Clydesdale Bank, suggested yesterday.
Speaking at the Ayr show -- the first big one of the season -- he
advised dairymen to avoid panic buying in the final few months of the
milk year. They should strive, instead, to make good long-term business
decisions, he said.
''Regard it like a tractor. You are going to use it for a number of
years, after which it will be worth less than you paid for it.
''To make a sound business decision you have to be able to select from
three options -- buy, lease or reduce output. Producers who don't enter
the quota market until it is too late for them to cut production are
putting themselves in a quota straitjacket from which they are unlikely
to be able to negotiate a good deal.
''Leasing quota late in the year at, for example, 20p a litre may seem
a bargain when set against a potential fine of 29p a litre. However,
given the time to make a rational decision, a 20p a litre investment to
cover an average margin of 18p to 19p a litre doesn't look so clever.
''We know that the quota system is here for at least a further five
years. Working from that base, therefore, to write off a purchase price
of 55p a litre by the year 2000, allowing for a 10% interest charge,
would cost around 14.5p a litre for each of the five years in question.
For a business with good margins and a strong capital base, such a
purchasing policy could make good sense.''
Acquiring additional quota would always be a personal farm-by-farm
decision, he said. Even the strongest businesses would need to look
carefully at a number of dairy sector ''what-ifs''.
Over the last 10 years a lot of dairy enterprises had quietly invested
in a bit more quota year by year and had created stronger businesses as
a result. There were lessons there, he suggested, for the beef and sheep
producers. They should not hold back from buying more quota just because
there was a cost involved.
Meanwhile, in the Ayrshire cattle section of the show the champion's
trophy went to Thomas Hodge of Chapel Farm, Duns, Berwickshire with
Rulesmains Maiden taking part in her first show. She is one of a herd of
130. His son, James Hodge of Eyemouth, made it a family double by taking
the Holstein Friesian trophy with Whitborne Counselor Ghost, a
four-year-old with two calvings.
The Ayrshire reserve champion's prize went to R Dunlop and Sons,
Midkelton, Castle Douglas with Dunlop's Cushy 117, while the Holstein
Friesian reserve was Holywell Counselor Snow, shown by David Yates and
Sons of East Logan, Castle Douglas.
Other results were: Jersey cattle -- champion and reserve Robert
Graham, Authrey Kerse, Bridge of Allan. Simmental -- champion Hugh
Wallace and WW Wales, Redding Farm, Galston Ayrshire; reserve William
Murdoch and Sons, Torr Dalrymple, Ayr. Belgian Blue -- champion J&amp;M
Cartney, Currarie, Lendalfoot, Girvan; reserve John Leggat, Broomfield
Farm, Larkhall.
Sheep results: Border Leicester -- champion JP Forsyth, Glenside Farm,
Maybole; reserve JB Barrowman, North Knockglass, Stranraer. Suffolk --
champion David and John Steel, West End, Jackton, East Kilbride; reserve
Don Frame, Haspielaw Farm, Hamilton. Texel -- champion J Warnock,
Sandylands, Lanark; reserve JP Forsyth, Glenside Farm, Maybole.
Charollais -- champion J&amp;I Kinnaird, Finatie, Kinross; reserve G
McIlwraith, Stannock, Whithorn, Wigtownshire. Bleu du Maine -- champion
and reserve J&amp;I Beck, Port O'Spittal, Stranraer. Rouge -- champion A
McQuater, Monkwood Mill, Maybole; reserve D Alexander, Millside,

* CURRAGH trainer John Oxx will keep Ridgewood Pearl at home this
weekend as the ground at Newmarket is considered too fast for the filly
in Sunday's Madagans 1000 Guineas.
''We had left Ridgewood Pearl in earlier in the week in case the
ground eased. We have decided now that there is little point in sending
her to Newmarket and her next run will be in the Irish equivalent at the

Elkmont, Alabama,
Wednesday
THE southern state of Alabama took a step into the past today as it
became the first state to reinstitute chain gangs.
Inmates wearing orange safety vests and white uniforms imprinted with
''chain gang'' got off five buses in the early-morning chill, then
kneeled in groups of five on the dew-covered grass as guards placed the
shiny steel shackles around their ankles.
Soon dozens were shuffling amid the jingling of the leg irons along
the roadside of a motorway near Elkmont.
Alabama is the first state to bring back chain gangs, which were a
common sight until public opinion was stirred by the 1932 film I Am a
Fugitive From a Chain Gang, about an innocent man brutalised on a
Southern chain gang.
No-one at the state Corrections Department can recall exactly when, or
why, Alabama did away with chain gangs.
Donald Claxton, spokesman for the governor, said the new shackles were
lighter and more modern. ''Take the image you have from the 1930s and
dismiss that. These aren't the ball-and-chain things,'' he said.
Almost 400 inmates from Limestone Correctional Facility were assigned
to the chain gang duty today. Inmates must serve 30, 60 or 90 days on
the gangs, depending on behaviour.
The inmates on the job today held a rubbish bag, swing blade or shovel
with one hand and the chain with the other as they began making their
way along the roadside in groups of five. Guards toting guns watched
them, and guard dogs barked from nearby prison pickup trucks.
''It's an experience I will never forget. I hope and pray I don't
never come back. I don't like the idea of being used as a political
chess piece,'' said Dwayne Rowe, a 25-year-old inmate serving seven
years for selling cocaine.
The gangs are part of a directive from Governor Fob James that many
inmates be put to work and denied TV and other privileges. The goal is
to make prison so unpleasant that people think twice before committing
crimes.
Critics say shackling prisoners together and making them work is
inhumane and will cause problems in the state's 18 prisons, which hold
nearly 20,000 inmates.
''Somebody is enjoying the dickens out of this. But it's creating a
lot of resentment and morale problems,'' said John Hale, a Department of
Corrections spokesman who retired last month. He said prison
administrators he talked to oppose the programme.
The American Civil Liberties Union has pledged to sue to block the use
of chain gangs.--AP.

KEVIN Darley, who partners the red-hot favourite, Celtic Swing, in
Saturday's 2000 Guineas warms up at Hamilton Park today with mounts in
all seven races.
Most significantly, he rides Flyaway Blues for Peter Savill, Celtic
Swing's owner, in the East Kilbride Handicap.
The Mary Reveley-trained three-year-old was a close-up fourth at Ripon
two weeks ago.
He also rides two for Mick Channon, Chastleton in the Bellshill
Claiming Stakes second division and the unraced two-year-old Whispering
Dawn in the Coatbridge Maiden Auction Stakes.
Jack Berry has a 100% record with unraced two-year-olds in Scotland so
far this season, and there is bound to be a lot of support for Sunday
Maelstrom in the five-furlong downhill sprint.
Also fancied will be the southern raider, Our Tom's Boy, trained by
Ken Ivory in Hertfordshire and ridden by another favourite with local
punters, George Duffield.
Linda Perratt's determination to have an early winner is demonstrated
by her entering three runners in the IMI Yorkshire Fittings Six Furlongs
Handicap.
Strathtore Dream and Miss Pigalle are yet to win, but Diet, a standing
dish at Hamilton Park, is a fair old battler and has won over the course
and distance five times.
In the same race, Jack Berry's Two Moves In Front, owned in Ayrshire
by Robert Aird, also likes Hamilton and has won over the distance twice.

LESTER Piggott has denied that he is about to retire from race-riding
for the second time.
The 59-year-old housewives' favourite has yet to be seen in action in
Britain this season and has not even re-applied for a riding licence
from the Jockey Club. But he has been riding in Australia, Chile, Dubai,
and Singapore this winter.
And the rider of a record 30 British Classic winners said in the
Racing Post yesterday: ''I expect I'll be back later in the year. I've
done plenty of riding overseas in the last few months and I'm thinking
of taking a holiday.
''I'm planning to take some time off between now and the end of May.
After that I will think about getting my licence out again.
''I'll be going to the Guineas meeting, but not as a jockey. I'm
looking forward to watching the races from the stands.''
Piggott first retired from race-riding in 1985.
After a brief training career and a year in prison for tax offences he
made a return to the saddle in 1990.

Philip Stirling visits a family-run garden centre which celebrates a
special anniversary this month
IT'S a matter of quiet satisfaction to Andrew Duncan that his garden
centre takes more money in a day's trading than his father paid for the
two-acre plot 40 years ago this month.
Not that Andrew has a lot of spare time to look over his shoulder.
Modern garden centre business practice dictates forward thinking is a
central plank if steady growth is to be achieved.
Which is why he puts so much stock in keeping pace with foreign trends
and developments, and a close eye on Europe's flower capital, Holland.
''I've been fortunate to have been part of Leisuregro, a consortium of
eight garden centres which spread purchase and carriage costs from the
continent,'' said Andrew.
Weekly deliveries arrive from Aalsmeer. Lying outside Amsterdam, this
town boasts the largest flower and pot plant market in the world.
''The Dutch are unquestionably world leaders in flowers, pot plants,
and all manner of products for the garden. I'm constantly amazed at the
exciting new lines they bring on the market -- everything from colourful
new hybrids of old favourites such as busy-lizzies, to wooden garden
figurines,'' he said.
But planning is important also on the home front. One instance of
which, Duncan's placed their 1995 order for Christmas trees, lights, and
decorations back in January, shows the depth of vision required keep a
step ahead of competition.
Living in the bungalow next door to the Spanish-style arched frontage
of the Milngavie garden centre means he's never far from the
seven-day-a-week action. With a staff of 65 in and around the tearoom,
glasshouses, and the exterior displays, he is permanently on call to
deal with everything from casual enquiries to crisis management.
Well-known to his customers, he's been known to work from 7am to 11 at
night, Mr Duncan is constantly asked his opinion on everything from seed
catalogues to moss killers in the centre.
The legend on the side of Duncan's delivery vans reads ''Quality and
Service'' -- intertwined strands of a business philosophy which
customers have grown to trust and respect. Quality is the direct result
of buying the best, rather than the bargain plants. Hence the regular
deliveries from Holland. But Andrew Duncan has no qualms about buying
from wherever the best might be available. For young bedding plants,
which don't travel well, that means Scotland -- more often than not
Perth.
Service, on the other hand, cannot be imported. ''It must be developed
by a thorough knowledge of customer requirements and a willingness to
genuinely assist in a sale, not just be a sales assistant,'' said Mr
Duncan.
Fortunately, his staff are familiar with the Duncan's mission
statement, as Andrew recalled: ''A couple from the other side of
Milngavie admired our Dutch pot plants but weren't too taken by the
displays we'd made up in containers. They asked us if we'd make another
one to their order, which we were only too happy to do.''
''However, when the van arrived at the house we discovered we couldn't
get the tub through the gate posts. Eventually, we emptied the tub,
lifted it up over the posts, and re-bedded the plants in the tub
on-site.''
''The couple have since been back for more,'' he smiled.
Notwithstanding his constantly improving level of quality and service,
the whole concept of the garden centre has changed out of all
recognition in the last 20 years.
One telling sign is in the number of vegetable plants sold. ''At one
time we sold nearly 60,000 cabbage and cauliflower every year. Now we
are lucky to sell a couple of dozen. Most people don't have the time to
grow food. What time they do have, they want to relax in,'' Andrew
added.
Rather than a bag of peat and a tray of tomato seedlings, today's
shoppers are just as likely to come in for for a cup of coffee in the
bistro before a browse around the array of silk flowers, semi-precious
stones, earthenware pots, and decorative candles, before heading into
the garden centre proper. There, gas barbecues command equal floor space
with fertilisers, while garden furniture crowds the stock of rakes and
hoes.
''I suppose the business could always claim to be part of the leisure
industry but never more so than today,'' said Mr Duncan.
The biggest single change in the business has been Duncan's tearoom.
Opened seven years ago, it now commands 35 full and part-time assistants
to run it -- over half the entire staff.
A bright spot on the Duncan map was when his daughter, Anne, won the
Interflora ''Best Bridal Bouquet'' award last year. No mean feat in the
extremely competitive fresh flower market of today.
But while he's happy with the way Duncan's has mushroomed from its
beginnings, Andrew, who qualified from Auchincruive many years ago as
with a diploma in horticultural studies, is happiest when his hands are
dirty with peat and he's growing plants from seed.
''We still grow our own tomato seedlings and several other species of
bedding plants, simply because we haven't found any better anywhere
else,'' he smiled. ''If I could do the whole thing all over again, I'd
love to grow more.''
With his wife, Margaret, and daughter, Anne, busy in various parts of
the centre there seems little doubt Duncan's growing tradition will
continue to flourish.

POINT-TO-POINT
A NASTY fall at Kelso on Marshalstoneswood has brought the season to a
premature end for Scotland's top women rider, Alison Bowie.
She was admitted to Borders' General Hospital with concussion and a
fractured wrist after the fall in Tuesday evening's United Border
Hunters' Chase won by Royal Jester.
Her father, Jim, confirmed yesterday that Alison who had been due to
ride Marshalstoneswood at the Lauderdale meeting on Saturday would miss
the remaining three meetings.
Although well behind Pauline Robson in the race for the Northern Area
women's championship, the Denholm rider has had her best season with
five wins and an unlucky disqualification.
At the Fife meeting on Saturday, she was an impressive winner of the
women's open on Orange Ragusa, going clear from three out and beating
Robson, on Gunmetal Boy, by 15 lengths in the fastest time of the day.
The previous week she won the women's open at Aspatria on
Marshalstonewood, the family horse, triumphing over Ready Steady in a
tight finish.
Apart from Tuesday night's fall, her biggest diappointment was at the
Buccleuch meeting, when she won the members' race by a distance but was
disqualified when she lost 7lb from her weight cloth, which had burst.
Kevin Anderson, now five points clear of Andrew Parker in the men's
championship, has four possible rides at Mosshouses but has reservations
about the going.
He is due to ride Jimmy River in the open, Miss Enrico in the
confined, Howayman in the restricted, and Give It Laldy in the maiden.
Anderson, who had a double at the Fife meeting with Miss Enrico and
Bit of Blether, warned they will not run if the ground is too firm.
Parker who won the prestigious Heart of All England Hunter Chase on
Royal Stream has only one possible ride, Guiting Grey in the restricted.

WHEN Andrew Duncan's father, Robert, bought six glasshouses growing
tomatoes on a patch of land on the outskirts of Milngavie, it seemed
like a step up on the self-improvement ladder from the landscape
gardening business he'd been running in nearby Bearsden.
Not that business at Main Street Nursery, as it was then known, was
booming.
Robert, a former market gardener from Montrose, sold his tomatoes for
a shilling a pound, often at his back door well after a full day spent
in the glasshouses.
A gardener of the old school, he was an expert on bedding plants and
flowers, a passion he passed on to Andrew even before the son went to
horticultural college.
But traditional skills couldn't cope with the changing demands of the
public, and Andrew finally opened a florist department in the centre in
1957.
It proved the first of many innovations but the real boom period came
in 1972 when Percy Thrower agreed to travel north to officially ''open''
a number of garden centres -- one of them the nursery. Andrew decided it
would be a good time for a new name, and Duncan's was born.
''The crowds came out to see Britain's most famous gardener, and
that,'' said Andrew, ''was the day Scottish garden centres arrived on
the map.''
As central heating became commonplace in homes, Andrew bought in a few
sub-tropical plants from South America such as Calathea as a sales
experiment. They require warm, humid conditions all year round.
Non-starters outdoors due to the Scottish climate, they fare well not
too far from a radiator. Unsurprisingly, the public took to them in
spades.
Now in his sixties, Andrew could be forgiven for sitting back on his
laurels. That he flatly refuses to do so -- ''I'm not of a mind to
retire'' -- is the measure of a man relentlessly seeking to improve on
an business that has already grown out of all recognition to its former
self.

Nairobi, Wednesday
BRITISH hotelier John Ward notified Kenya's government today he would
claim in court expenses from a private investigation into the 1988
murder of his daughter Julie.
''Our client intends to claim in the suit all expenses, damages and
costs he incurred during his private investigations into the murder of
his daughter, Julie Ward,'' said James Orengo, a Nairobi lawyer retained
by Ward.
''This could run into millions of pounds sterling.''
Miss Ward's charred remains were found in a mound of ashes in a remote
corner of Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve, 125 miles south of the
capital Nairobi.
Ward has said he had spent over #300,000 to conduct the private
investigation. But Orengo said the sum had increased with new inquiries
after Kenyan authorities failed to solve the murder case.
Orengo today sent the high court a notice of intention to launch court
proceedings against Attorney-General Amos Wako, former police
commissioner Philip Kilonzo and state chief pathologist Jason Kaviti.
Kenyan police initially said Miss Ward had been eaten by wild animals
and pathologist Kaviti suggested she may have committed suicide. Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi ordered an inquest after Ward's initial
inquiry disproved the assertions.
Two game rangers charged with Miss Ward's murder were found not guilty
and freed in 1993. The trial judge called the police callous and said
they had bungled the investigation.
''Despite clear evidence of murder, Kenyan police under Kilonzo
refused to admit or acknowledge that a murder had been committed and
exhibited a lack of interest in undertaking murder investigations,''
Orengo said in his notice to the high court.
''The Kenyan police were under statutory duty not only to maintain law
and order but also to investigate crime,'' he said.
Ward has maintained that he would not have embarked on a very
expensive investigation had the Kenyan authorities not tried to cover-up
his daughter's murder.--Reuter.

THE Duchess of York yesterday offered to help a cancer victim whose
health authority refused to give her treatment.
The 10-year-old known as Child B for legal reasons, has been receiving
chemotherapy for leukaemia at a private London clinic since she was
refused help on the NHS.
Now the Duchess has promised to find a place for the youngster at a
special mountain retreat in Poland built by the Children in Crisis
charity.
She told GMTV the special clinic, which has an outside swimming pool,
climbing frames and country walks, will help Child B recover from the
treatment.
''We can help her just by offering her support that she might need and
offering her some holiday time in the mountain haven which is a paradise
of positive energy. And just by saying if you need us we are there,''
she said.

PATROLS will be touring Glasgow city centre in an attempt to tackle
Strathclyde's high school truancy rate.
Strathclyde police and Strathclyde Regional Council's education
department yesterday announced a joint initiative aimed at deterring
children from skipping school and combating the associated problem of
shoplifting.
A police officer and a school attendance officer, on secondment from
the education department, will patrol the streets, stopping children
they suspect of playing truant. Using mobile phones the team will
immediately contact the school to check why a pupil is absent. Schools
and the attendance officer will then take any further action.
Superintendent Bill McMillan said the scheme would operate until the
end of the school session. He said truancy often led to shoplifting,
pointing out 120 of the 522 shoplifting offences committed in the first
quarter of this year involved children. Nearly half took place during
school hours.
These figures, he added, were only the tip of the iceberg. He said
some truants became involved in more serious robberies.
The city centre acted as a magnet for truants with many children
believing they could pass unnoticed in arcades and crowded shops. He
dismissed the notion of organised crime gangs, but said children were
tempted to shoplift if an opportunity arose. Retailers, he added,
supported the scheme.
Mr David Alexander, the region's depute director of education, said
that in Strathclyde the secondary school truancy rate ran at around
10-12%, while around 3-4% of primary pupils missed school.
He said the officers would be focusing their attention on those in
first to third year at secondary school and it was hoped that
information could be gathered about which areas truants came from.
''We hope once we've evaluated the scheme we will be able to extend
it. The basic message is that pupils should stay in school where they
can't get into any bother.''

MARK Johnston yesterday discovered that he can still train Group
winners and that in stable jockey Darryll Holland he has an able
replacement for Jason Weaver.
The Middleham trainer emerged from an untypically lacklustre start to
the turf campaign to saddle an Ascot double that included a first
Pattern race success this year with Double Trigger in the Sagaro Stakes.
Until today just two winners, both secured on Saturday, had come out
of Kingsley House stables in the past fortnight.
But Double Trigger returned to action to deny Poltarf by a head under
former stable No.1 Weaver and while the gossips considered the
significance of that booking, Holland captured the Garter Stakes on
stablemate Unconditional Love.
Jawaal landed the Victoria Cup from Royal Hill by a neck.

William Russell reviews three new releases -- the nice, the nasty and
the nonsense
UTTERLY beguiling, Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is a lesson to
our so-called film industry, which seems to consist entirely of people
who have sold out to Hollywood, or stay at home whingeing away making
rotten little television movies and turning green every time they think
of Four Weddings.
All you need, however, apart from luck, is a good idea -- and talent.
To be fair to our home-grown lot, there is this week a film which, for
all its faults, is for once more than just a pilot for a failed
television series.
Directed by Philip Davis, i.d. takes a chilling look at the nature of
the beast in man as revealed on the football terraces. It is topical,
powefully acted -- the sheer animal energy the cast generate is
terrifying -- and manages to be about the sort of people who go to
football matches and fight without once showing a football match.
In one way this is a strength, because it avoids having to explain the
game to the audience, in another a weakness, because the male bonding
that leads to violence occurs on the pitch too, as Eric Cantona and
others have demonstrated from time to time.
But let's start with pleasant things. Richard Linklater's bewitching
account of what it is like to be young and fancy free, a film with no
violence, no bad language, and, oddly, no sex scene, although love is
certainly in the air.
It stars Julie Delpy as Celine, a young French girl travelling from
Budapest to Paris by train, and Ethan Hawke as Jesse, a young American,
who changes his seat to escape a quarrelling couple. He finds himself
next to Celine, and they start to talk. He is going to Vienna to catch a
flight to the United States the following morning and, when the train
arrives, suggests to Celine that maybe she would like to spend the rest
of the time left with him looking at the city. He is a pleasant, gauche
young man. They have been chatting happily, and she is intrigued. It is
an adventure, a mad thing to do, and she agrees.
They spend their time wandering round the city talking about the
things young people who have only just met and are exploring each
other's personality talk about. They visit the famous Ferris wheel,
listen to records in a store, meet eccentric people, and persuade a
barman to stand them a bottle of wine when their money runs out, which
they take to a park and drink lying on the grass beneath the stars.
The night passes, they talk about having sex, decide against it, and
next day she catches her train. But they cannot say goodbye and agree to
meet in six months time in the same place. Will they? Who knows. But it
hardly matters because this is not about the start of a romance, a life
long love affair, but about being young, romantic, and foolish.
Linklater, who made Slackers and Dazed and Confused, sustains the
interest by skilfully varying the pace as they tour the city, and
cleverly avoids making one of those Three Coins in the Fountain- type
illustrated travelogues. Both Delpy and Hawke are perfect, the one
European chic and intelligence, the other an eager-beaver Californian
dreamer. Their chatter is hardly of the highest intellectual level, but
it rings true in the perfect feel-good movie.
That cannot be said about i.d. Feel good it is not. John (Reece
Dinsdale), a young, cocky policeman stationed in a south London manor is
sent undercover as part of a four-man team led by a Sergeant called
Trevor (Richard Graham). The job is to infiltrate the local gang of
football hooligans who support Shadwell. It is late 1980s, when football
violence was at its height, and the film follows their adventures as
they go undercover, pretend to be itinerant housepainters working the
district, start with lunchtime pints in the hard men's pub, The Rock,
move on to evening drinks, slowly revealing their knowledge of
Shadwell's doings until they are accepted as soulmates.
The barmaid (Saskia Reeves) fancies John, while Trevor, a decent,
warm-hearted man, continually risks giving the game away; pretending to
be a lout being hardly second nature to him. John, on the other hand,
takes to the camaraderie of fandom like a duck to water. Over the
months, seduced by the tacky glamour of belonging, by the reassurance of
being one of the lads he slowly becomes one of them. Dinsdale charts
John's decline from slightly thuggish cop to neo-nazi skinhead
brilliantly, and the rest of the cast, particularly Sean Pertwee as one
of the thugs he befriends, turn in amazingly authentic performances. The
violence is largely verbal -- the worst incident involving John takes
place off screen. It is the sheer awfulness of their uncontrolled animal
behaviour, the pit bull in man, which shocks.
The south and east London locations have been chosen with care, and
one would never know that the pitches used for the stand scenes were
actually in the North of England. The casting of Warren Clarke as the
landlord of The Rock was mistaken because, while a good actor, he
carries too much baggage from past performances as assorted thugs for
the film's good. But that said, i.d. looks like a film, not an extended
episode of The Bill. This could be because the cameraman, Thomas Mauch,
has worked on the likes of Fitzcarraldo, and the producer, Sally Hibben
(Riff-Raff, Raining Stones, Ladybird, Ladybird), knows a thing or two
about making low budget cinema films.
The publicity for Milk Money, which stars Melanie Griffith and Ed
Harris, claims you can't get enough of a good thing, but first you have
to find it. Well, you won't find it in this picture. If you sense the
milk of human kindness curdling, you would be right. It left me feeling
rancid.
Three small boys decide they want to see a naked woman, pool their
pocket money, and end up with V, tart with a heart (Miss Griffith). When
their bikes are stolen V gives them a lift home in her pimp's car and
meets Mr Harris, a widowed environmentalist, through one of the three,
his 12- year-old son, Frank (Michael Patrick Carter).
The pimp is murdered, V decides to stay in the suburbs, and Dad falls
for her, thinking she is his son's new mathematics tutor. One ghastly
thing duly leads to another even more ghastly. Miss Griffith is wasted,
Mr Harris has the charisma of something from the local wetlands he is
trying to save, and the small boys should be neither seen nor heard --
ever again. Malcolm McDowell, the villain hunting V because he thinks
she has run off with her pimp's drug money, sports the worst Cockney
accent in cinema history. Come back Dick van Dyke, all is forgiven.

A QUARTER of forestry investors in Scotland could find their woodlands
worthless, a chartered surveyors firm claimed yesterday.
Mr Raymond Henderson, of Perth-based Bidwells, said: ''The startling
fact is that the majority of those owning such forests are probably
unaware of their predicament.''
The company maintains the whole range of forest owners are affected.
''Institutions, pension funds, captains of industry, as well as private
individuals, may find their woodland asset to be worth a great deal less
than they may have thought,'' he added.
Mr Henderson said they believed that up to 25% of woodland properties
would never show a good economic return on development costs -- even
after taking into account historical tax concessions and planting
grants.
However, he said certain types of forest were performing very nicely
in investment terms.
But, he added, serious difficulties could occur because of a
combination of adverse factors such as remote location, bad access, low
site quality, poor species choice and high levels of future inputs
required.
Mr Henderson said private individuals, who are no longer able to
offset expenditure on their forest against taxable income, were urged to
take a serious look at what they wanted to achieve from their
investment.
Bidwells is launching a forest audit service aimed at owners eager to
see how their forests ''stack up'' against their objectives.
Meanwhile the company has set a closing date -- May 24 -- for the sale
of three ''prime'' Scottish forests, worth around a total of #3.5m.
The company said that the level of interest had been great for the
forests, one in Perthshire and two in the Borders.

MARY BRENNAN reports on an inspired piece of performance match-making
IT ALMOST shapes up like a live-art equivalent of Blind Date -- though
I'd be reluctant to cast the CCA's Mark Waddell in the guise of Cilla
Black. What he has done, though, is bring together two artists who have
never met, never seen each other's work, and matched them in a double
bill.
From London, there's Sarbjit Samra whose Hysterical Asians was seen at
last year's National Review of Live Art. And from Aberdeen, there's
Australian-born Peter McRae who recently took part in a CCA platform
event.
Now, given that this wasn't just a matter of availability, why connect
the two in one programme?
Both, it emerges, are fascinated, stimulated, by the way we ''lead''
meanings into everyday objects -- flags, in McRae's case and soap operas
among other media hits in Samra's. And both have a lively grasshopper
intellect that springs to several conclusions almost at once.
Unlike those WYSIWYG computer set-ups -- where What You See is What
you Get -- these performances challenge the onlooker to scan beyond the
immediate image. To think ''Why is he doing that?'' and then explore all
likely possibilities.
Or, possibly unlikely ones, where Samra is concerned. Since his
student days in Sheffield, Sarbjit Samra has deliberately avoided doing
what might have been expected of him as an Asian homosexual. ''Black
art. Queer art. That perspective of being a 'victim'. I wasn't
interested in subscribing to any of that. I didn't identify with that
niche, that kind of perspective. But it made it very awkward for me. It
still does. Because there I am, always in the margins, refusing to be a
part of these marketing stances. Questioning their relevance. Because I
think you always have to be critical of social groups to keep the
discourse open, healthy, fresh. Then you get niched -- as a dissident!''
Issues that do involve him are to do with cultural identity and the
forces that destabilise it, colonise it, destroy it. A prime target is
our uncritical surrender to all trends American. ''We have this absolute
fantasy about America -- it's bigger, it's better. We end up denying our
own culture, abnegating all responsibility for it. And yet there's this
British embarrassment about the whole business of American imperialism.
We absorb it, it absorbs us. No-one questions this gullibility, this
erosion of our identity.'' He certainly does -- though we agree, between
much giggling, that it's unlikely the British National Party will ever
thank him for his spirited efforts to safeguard British identity.
Breastfeeding, his latest work, continues his exploration of
surreptitious influences by looking at soap operas. He marvels at the
way some soaps have gone global -- ''Dallas in India. Offering people
there a surrogate community that they identify with at the expense of
their own. They become immersed. They truly lose themselves.''
For a brief period -- while he and his family were getting
acclimatised to life in Aberdeen, Peter McRae lost touch with
performing. A few months back, he saw some information about CCA
platforms -- slots where artists can try out ideas, receive feedback --
and decided it was time to start showing work again.
Air in Three Movements, which is his part of the double bill, is a
solo performance with flags. McRae recalls street-theatre days in his
native Australia when -- spending time at Bondi Beach -- he caught sight
of the flags being used by the life-saving team there. Alongside the
up-front messages ''Sharks here'' in big, bold letters -- there was a
whole coded language using colour, position, size to signal conditions
to swimmers throughout the day.
Something twitched in his imagination. He started thinking about
flags: what they represented within cultures, the different contexts
they were used in, the symbolic meanings they conveyed. Even the sounds
they made interested him. As often happens with familiar objects, once
he started to look closely at them, flags began to take on all kinds of
intriguing possibilities.
He started to incorporate them into performances. You can hear, feel
and see, some of the surprising effects of Peter McRae's visionary
flag-waving as part of the CCA's Mayfest programme.
* Sarbjit Samra and Peter McRae are in performance at CCA from today
till Saturday May 6.

Washington, Wednesday
THE FBI rather sheepishly have released two men they arrested in a
moment of high drama. They were suspected of being involved in the
Oklahoma City bombing, but turned out to be no more than a couple of
drifters.
The bureau issued an all-points alert for the two on Monday, together
with a photograph of one of them taken from his driver's licence.
They were found that night in a motel in southwest Missouri, some 200
miles northeast of Oklahoma City, and were arrested at dawn with the
full panoply of Swat teams, bomb disposal specialists and scores of
heavily armed police.
They were much astonished. One of them told a reporter after their
release: ''We had to jump out of bed and get dressed real quick and met
a Swat team in front of our door. It was real scary.''
The two had fallen under suspicion because they had been staying in
various dingy motels near Kingman, Arizona, which Timothy McVeigh had
used as a base of operations last year and early this year.
A few hours after McVeigh was arrested in Perry, Oklahoma, 90 miles
north of Oklahoma, the two men registered in a motel there.
The two, Gary Land and Robert Jacks, insist that they do not know
McVeigh and have no connection whatever with the bombing.
Evidently the FBI believed them. After being interrogated for 18
hours, they were released shortly after midnight this morning.
This episode is a setback for the bureau. The bombing was two weeks
ago, and although the police have a prime suspect, they have not
arrested his presumed chief accomplice, referred to as ''John Doe number
2'' (American police procedure always refers to an unknown man as John
Doe; unknown women are Jane Doe).
Nor have they charged two friends of McVeigh's, the brothers Nichols,
who are under arrest as possible witnesses.
They have also been charged with explosives crimes. Their lawyers say
that the charges are designed simply to keep them in prison while the
FBI builds a case against them for participation in the bombing.

THE year is 1752, the battleground the chapel of one of Scotland's
finest universities and the protagonists two eminent professors
quarrelling bitterly over how music should be performed in its hallowed
pews.
The combatants in this delightful recreation of a stormy episode in
Aberdeen University's 500-year history are chalk and cheese -- grumpy
Professor Kellas, who believes a man cannot devote his thoughts to
eternity if he's grappling with a cacophony of crochets, and the
scheming Professor Meldrum, who wishes to replace slothful psalms with
tuneful, ''scientific'' singing.
The conflict in characters makes ideal material for Robert Kemp's
fast-moving comedy, performed nightly until Friday as part of the
university's quincentenary celebrations and as a tribute to one of the
few university graduates to make a career as a truly Scottish
playwright. It is played out in the very chapel that witnessed these
ourtageous events, and its ornate decor is the perfect setting for a
work that borders on farce and revels in the rich Doric dialect.
With twists and turns, the upper hand twirls between professors,
spiced by tantalising exchanges between their daughters -- who liken a
day in church to a year anywhere else -- and the impressionable young
student and the soldier the academics recruit to their camps, only to
find the tables turned as the young singers prove anything other than
heavenly.
The seven-strong cast is drawn form local dramatic societies and the
university itself and there is a particularly lively performance from
Jill Hay as Professor Meldrum's acid-tongued wife, who blames scientific
singing for everything from burnt dinners to marital tragedy.

SINCE Liz Lochead first wrote Blood and Ice, its subject matter, Mary
Shelley, Frankenstein, and all things Gothic, has become something of a
zeitgeist, worked and reworked in forms ranging from the filmic versions
of the two Kens (Russell, and Brannagh) through Alasdair Gray's novel
Poor Things to numerous studies by feminist academics.
Lochead's play itself exists in 57 varieties. This current production,
directed by Fiona Walton, largely makes use of a script adapted for
radio, perhaps providing a clue to Walton's (with designer, Alan Reid)
sparse, minimalist staging. No Gothic excess here.
Light floods the stage as the production bursts into bold, saturated
colour; deep red and mustard velvet drapes, a bright sky-blue floor,
painted to suggest the tiles of an Italian piazza. No shadows,
mysterious corners or romantic gloom, instead, a contemporary quoting of
period motifs. The creature, visually understated in black with subtly
effective make-up by Leslie McDonald, prowls around the perimeter of the
performance area, more ordinarily human than monstrous.
Such a pared-down reading of the play may be an attempt to recuperate
the subject from extremes of scenographic excess; the visual overkills
of Russell's Gothic or Coppola's, Dracula, for instance. In doing so,
however, a rich area of dramatic expression was lost. Lochead is a
highly visual writer. Her lengthy and evocative stage descriptions in
Blood and Ice provide a layer of meaning and imagery which is
disregarded at cost.
Scenic images, notably the central metaphor of the mirror, were given
little prominence in this production. The piece relied almost entirely
on the abilities of a semi-professional cast, creating an interpretation
of undoubted interest, but one of limited dramatic appeal and emotional
depth.

FIONA FLECK, Hamburg, Wednesday
THE Prince of Wales commemorated the end of the Second World War today
by laying wreaths in honour of 45,000 German civilians who died in air
raids and Allied soldiers who fell in battle.
Fifty years to the day after British troops crossed the River Elbe and
secured the peaceful surrender of the northern German port city, local
dignitaries and war survivors joined former foes in a ceremony of
reconciliation.
The Prince and Hamburg's Mayor Henning Voscherau laid wreaths at the
War Graves Commission cemetery and the Air Raid Victims' Memorial -- a
cross-shaped mass grave in Ohlsdorf Cemetery where 37,000 people were
buried.
The royal visitor was accompanied by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
and Nicholas Soames, Minister of State for the Armed Forces,
representing the British Government at end-of-war celebrations in
Germany's second city.
A cluster of pensioners stood by wiping away tears as they remembered
relatives killed in Allied air raids.
''It's good we are finished with revenge,'' said Ursula Andretzki, 72,
admitting her bitterness over her parents' deaths had not been easy to
overcome.
The Prince alternated between German and English to stress peace and
reconciliation between Britain and Germany in a speech to some 17,000
people filling Hamburg's Rathaus Markt square.
''Armies can do away with dictators, but cannot order freedom. Freedom
must come from within, from people themselves,'' he said from a podium
set up in front of the elaborate Flemish Renaissance-style city hall.
''Today we admire Germany for its pluralism, stability, humanity and
firmly-embedded democracy as principles of your society,'' he said.
''Since 1945 we've come a long way because we have held together.''
The mayor of Hamburg emphasised the Allies' role at the end of the war
as liberators from Nazi tyranny, in a speech touching on the topical
debate over whether the end of the war also meant the defeat and
humiliation of the German people.
''We should see this day in no other way but as a liberation, the end
of the war and a new beginning in that order,'' he said.
The Prince also honoured Allied soldiers buried in the same
cemetery.--Reuter.

Next on the platforms is David Belcher, searching behind the seventies
sequins to talk sweet and sling mud about rock of a glamorous era
There's a market out there, you see. It knows glam was a giggle rather
than an art-form.
YOU won't find an entry for glam in any self-respecting encyclopaedia
of rock, particularly not a British one. You can almost picture the prim
pop-historians' horror.
Groups of donnish archivists in musically-correct Steely Dan T-shirts
recoiling with a shudder at the very mention of glam's unholy trinity --
Gary Glitter, the Sweet, and leering Les Gray, the unacceptable face of
Mud. The glam-rock era: our nation's shame, not worth thinking about . .
.
Of course, such critical snobbery cuts no ice with the mainstream
music-loving public, Mr and Mrs Terry Tinsel, and thousands just like
them up and down the land.
Their undying, albeit self-consciously, jokey devotion sustains glam's
tarnished remnants year-round on the revival circuit and at special
events such as the Annual Seventies and Glam Rock Weekender at unglam
Pontin's Holiday Camp, Hemsby, Norfolk.
There's a market out there, you see. It knows glam was a giggle rather
than an art-form. Nevertheless it won't go away. Hence Channel 4's
four-hour mini-glamathon next Monday evening.
Kicking things off at 9pm will be The Glam Top 10, presented by the
Undead DJ Posse, or Tony Blackburn and Alan Freeman as they are more
usually known. As well as fave glam blasts-from-the-past, there will be
20-year-old archive footage of Slade, T Rex, the Sweet, Mud, Suzi
Quatro, Gary Glitter et al in their heyday, plus up-to-date
reminiscences from most of the guilty parties in a series of
freshly-recorded interviews.
That will be followed by Glam-O-Rama, a seventies-fixated kitsch 'n'
trivia quiz hosted by top glum-yockster Jack Dee. ''From Abba to Ziggy
Stardust, lava lamps to tank tops, Glam-O-Rama has the final word on
what made the seventies a decade which was both tragic and magic,''
promise the programme-makers.
Additionally, there's The Token King, a nostalgic one-hour drama set
in a comprehensive in 1974, before C4's glam trip climaxes in a
late-night re-screening of Remember Me This Way. Centred on a sold-out
Gary Glitter gig at London's long-defunct Rainbow Theatre in the winter
of 1973, this rockumentary was produced by Gary's studio collaborator,
Mike Leander, and sought on its cinema release in 1974 to wring the last
few shillings out of the glam rock boom's dying echoes.
Aye, it didn't last long. From October, 1970, and the arrival in the
British charts of T Rex's fey classic Ride A White Swan until summer
1973 and the self-willed death of Ziggy Stardust, that's my definition
of the glam-span. Highpoints? David Bowie's Jean Genie. Get It On and
Hot Love by T Rex. Bryan Ferry's greasily-sculpted quiff and unblinking
gaze during Roxy Music's best era, the original one of lurex and
feathers when Brian Eno was still in the group. Noddy Holder's mirrored
top hat.
There was some deeply dodgy stuff in there during that brief spell,
too. Not least a kiddies' music show on ITV called Lift Off, presented
by the ghastly Ayeshea Brough and Roy North.
Those two names mean little today, but if you can imagine an Amanda de
Cadenet who sang as well as spoke, and a perkier, more eager-to-please
Terry Christian with a gormless, open-mouthed Hull accent . . . yes,
they were that bad.
And there was Little Willy by the Sweet. Poppa Joe by the Sweet. Plus
Co-Co and Wig Wam Bam by . . . the Sweet. And virtually every glam ditty
which oozed, as the aforementioned four titles did, from the blunt nibs
of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman. And not to mention the
gay-brickies-in-drag look favoured by Messrs Connolly, Priest, Tucker
and Scott . . . otherwise known as -- yes, you've twigged -- the Sweet.
Worst of all, there were the most blatant bandwagon jumpers. Alvin
sodding Stardust. An American no-hit wonder called Jobriath. Who
remembers Jobriath these days? No one, actually, apart from the American
compilers of the 1983 edition of the Rolling Stone Encyclopaedia of Rock
and Roll. They don't have an entry for glam rock, but they do have one
for glitter rock: ''Early seventies backlash against the late sixties
sexual revolution,'' they note.
''It revolved around glorified sexual ambiguity and androgyny and a
fashion-consciousness best expressed by Roxy Music. Self-consciously
decadent, glitter-rockers adorned themselves with foppish and/or
futuristic clothing, lots of make-up and glitter dust.
''It subsequently became a debased code that could even apply to such
performers as Jobriath.''
Glitter/glam didn't travel well across the Atlantic, you see. No need
for it, really. Glam was predicated on a hardy British perennial: our
all-round embarrassment about liberated sexual display, our unease at
the blurring of visual boundaries between the genders.
America has always been more sure and open sexually, hasn't it? After
all, America invented jeans, the first unisex garment. And America gave
the world jazz, funk and rock 'n' roll, all of which are euphemisms for
hanky-panky, you know, how's-your-father, thingmy, wotsit.
What have we managed in return in repressed Britain? Trad. Skiffle.
Euphemisms for cold and limp. And that stage-form in which men dress up
in skirts and call themselves Widow Twankey. Which reminds me.
See the Sweet, see pantomime dames . . .

OPERA on a Shoestring may be one of Scotland's youngest companies, but
it is rapidly coming of age. Tickets for its Mayfest performances of
Verdi's La Traviata are selling like hot cakes . . . and you will have
your cake and eat it and like it.
Everything about this production is fascinating. It's the most
ambitious the young company has undertaken, and -- if it has the stamina
to sustain the quality evinced last night on the opening night for a
further five performances -- the enterprise will be justified. The opera
is performed in the round; small chorus, big effect on a wee stage. And
the company, in Terry Gilbert's intense production which goes like the
wind, exploit every inch of available space.
There's a vertiginous feeling to the bustling crowd scenes, tightly
choreographed, almost threatening to explode the space. Soloists come
right off the stage. In Act Three, Allan Adams's light yet high-tensile
Alfredo gets right up among the audience: Opera on a Shoestring? Opera
in the round? This is opera in yer face.
Highly colourful, as concentrated in solo and quiet moments as it is
bristling in crowd and ensemble scenes, this atmospherically-lit
production draws you right into the musical and dramatic texture.
Christina Dunwoodie gives the performance of her career as Violetta,
superbly characterised, and so close-up you can read her face, hear her
breathe. Excellent lyrical singing too from Peter Winton-Thomas as
Germont senior.
Accompaniment, in Jeremy Silver's highly effective arrangement for
piano trio, is at once intimate and dramatic, and stylishly delivered.
The whole thing is a touching, exciting, unusual and absorbing view of
Verdi's great opera. See it in the Cottier, the venue of tomorrow.

THE graphics wizards who provide the special effects for Hollywood
blockbusters yesterday set up home in Scotland.
California-based Silicon Graphics' claim to fame is the stunning
visual effects in box office hits Jurassic Park, Forrest Gump, Hunt for
Red October and Demi Moore's latest sensation, Disclosure.
But, as the company unveiled its Scottish operation in Falkirk's
Callendar Business Park, it revealed a range of applications for the
offshore oil industry, education, entertainment and the aviation
industry.
Mr Nigel Seed, managing director of the firm which also has a base in
Reading, said: ''Our new office in Falkirk is to help Scottish
companies, research and education establishments develop even more
thrilling and advanced ways of using computers that will change the way
we learn, work and entertain ourselves.''
Silicon Graphics' Scottish customers already include five
universities, Scottish Nuclear, Motorola, GEC/Marconi and the oil
industry.
Mr Seed added: ''In just five years, the computer and video games
business has become larger than recorded music and jeans.''
The firm revealed how its systems had saved one oil rig constructor
#1.5m by spotting a tiny design flaw before the structure was built.
Marketing manager Howard Rippiner told how, in the computer graphics
age, nothing is quite what it seems.
He revealed that the newscasters on BBC TV sit in a bare room
furnished only with a small desk and added: ''Everything around them is
computer-generated.''

A fight-back by female composers is sweet music to LESLEY DUNCAN
WOMEN composers? No doubt Dr Johnson could have framed a suitable
putdown. Didn't he, after all, compare women preachers to dogs walking
on their hind legs? The fact is that hundreds of women have created
music though somehow the academic establishment has seen fit largely to
ignore them.
Amends for this neglect will be made on Sunday afternoon at the
Cottier Theatre, Hyndland Street, Glasgow, when the Chamber Group of
Scotland give a programme entitled Singing Outside Heaven.
It will feature the work of four women composers -- Fanny Mendelssohn,
sister of Felix; Clara Schumann, wife of Robert; the short-lived Lili
Boulanger (1893-1918) and Janet Beat, who is alive and well and teaching
at the RSAMD.
Writer Janice Galloway has supplied a commentary (which will be read
by Morag Hood). Her involvement with the project was suggested by the
composer Sally Beamish, whose own success is a sign of changed
attitudes.
Galloway has robust views on women's creativity, on received judgments
in music and literature. On the fact, too, that the history of music is
the history of men's music.
Her commentary is drawn from letters and diaries of the women
composers concerned. There is a poignant diary entry from 20-year-old
Clara Schumann, quoted in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and
Musicians:
''I once thought that I possessed creative talent, but I have given up
this idea; a woman must not desire to compose -- no-one has been able to
do it, and why should I expect to? It would be arrogance, although
indeed, my father led me into it in earlier days.''
Janice Galloway completes the quote: ''May Robert always create. That
must make me happy.''
Galloway fulminates: ''There were whole nineteenth-century schools
that taught that woman cannot create because of their brain size!'' When
women composers were so belittled, how were they supposed to develop
confidence, she demands?
As for Sunday's music, Janet Beat's Five Projects for Joan was written
for Joan Dickson, the cellist, who had a very good class of young
players at the RSAMD but couldn't find appropriate pieces.
Boulanger's Nocturne for violin and piano was written for female
friends. The piano trio by Clara Schumann is a ''wonderful, dark
piece''.
The Mendelssohn, by contrast, ''just goes like stink''. At a recent
performance at Gordonstoun, everyone was convinced they had heard it
before. How doubly sad, then, that Fanny (consistently discouraged from
publishing by her brother) felt that not having an audience was a kind
of death.
It's the old story, says Janice Galloway. You need a enormous amount
of fortitude and backbone to be creative. It is difficult enough without
finding bumps up your jersey making things worse.

TOBY GOUGH's brand of Promenade Theatre is not for the faint-hearted
-- and I speak as one who traipsed over Calton Hill after Klytemnestra's
Bairns. Keeping up with the various set pieces that make up his life
story of eighteenth-century Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is a
challenge frequently issued by the company during this revision of last
year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe hit. That and the instruction to keep
off the grass (''that's the stage!'').
The new version of the piece features original music by Bennett Hogg,
played by a string quartet (guitar, no viola), and the musicians make a
better job of keeping up with the action -- chairs, music stands and
all. In the Kibble Palace a xylophone echoed in the glass. That's about
all I can tell you about that bit, because the first night (the show
runs to May 14) was a victim of its own success and if you found
yourself too far back in the crowd for certain sections it was an aural
experience only.
Elsewhere, however, a unicorn and the four horsemen of the apocalypse
gamboled in the swath, as tales culled from Greek mythology,
Shakespeare, and other cultures were used to illustrate and comment on
the great man's life. It was showtime in the garden of (Sw)Eden and
fabulous in its literal sense. The sex life of plants and crockery is
beyond the fantasies of Lewis Carroll.
Carl Linnaeus's legacy is the system we still use for the
classification of plants, and there is much reference to the naming of
things, and the limitations of definition. So let's just call this
unclassifiable theatre.

MARINA CARR's poetic, probing work provides the welcome sight of
massed female representation on stage, beautifully realised by fluid
ensemble acting by the Abbey Theatre Company. A narrator, Millie,
recalls the troubled marriage of her parents, the eponymous Mai and a
self-indulgent cellist, Robert.
The play opens with Robert's return, after an unexplained five-year
absence, to a beautiful glass-fronted lakeside house which The Mai has
built while he was gone. It has been built by her sweat and tears and is
her monument to him, a temple to lure him home.
Members of her tight-knit female family gather to chide her for this
devotion, the most vocal being her grandmother, the wonderfully feisty
Grandma Fraochlain, whose impatience with her granddaughter's
sacrificial ethos is ironic in the face of her own oft-declared
obsession with a husband 60 years dead.
The banter between her and The Mai's sisters, Connie and Beck, and her
own daughters, the elderly Agnes and Julie, bristles with both humour
and poignancy. She's a rare representation, a woman defying the norm of
matriarchal martyrdom who, in an opium fugg, blithely declares of her
brood: ''I would have hurled the seven of you down the slopes of hell
for just one more night with the nine-fingered fisherman.'' Not exactly
an admirable sentiment but refreshing none the less.
While the play ripples with life in the first half it stagnates in the
second; earlier momentum is lost and it lurches into maudlin
sentimentalism. The final dissolve, into an image of The Mai drowning
herself -- a reference to an earlier folklore allusion of a lake of
tears -- pitches the haunting, elegiac tone into a paean to victimhood.

A DIRECTOR of a pharmacy chain yesterday denied his company racially
discriminates against Scots.
However, Dr Richard Middleton, superintendent pharmacist with Lloyds
Retail Chemists Ltd, admitted locums in England and Wales were generally
paid more than those in Scotland.
He was giving evidence on the second day of Mr Joseph Greig's racial
discrimination claim at an industrial tribunal in Glasgow.
Mr Greig, 45, of Renfrew, told the tribunal earlier that he only found
out by accident that locum pharmacists in England were paid #11 an hour
while Scots only got #10. He was paid the English rate by mistake and
was asked to repay the difference.
Dr Middleton accepted that the majority of Scots were paid #10 an hour
and those working in England and Wales got #11. However, he said there
was no racial discrimination.
He said the reason for the differential was ''manpower availability''.
He added: ''A lower number of pharmacists are available for locum work
in England and Wales than there are in Scotland.''
Mr Douglas Readings, representing Lloyds Retail Chemists Ltd, conceded
that Mr Greig was a Scot and part of a racial group.
But he added: ''Had he been English, Welsh, Irish or any other ethnic
origin he would have been paid the same rate for working as a locum
chemist in Scotland.
''If the same person works in Scotland and England that person gets
the higher rate while working in England and the lower rate while
working in Scotland.''
Mr Raj Jandoo, for Mr Greig, referred to a previous House of Lords
decision which said Scots were part of a nation because of Bannockburn,
Flodden, and Culloden and the pipes at Lucknow, because of Jenny Geddes
and Flora Macdonald, because of frugal living and respect for learning,
and because of Robert Burns and Walter Scott.
He said the Lords' decision added: ''By the Act of Union English and
Scots lost their separate nationalities, but they retained their
separate nationhoods, and their descendants have thereby retained their
separate national origins.''
Mr Jandoo said if Lloyds paid a Scottish pharmacist less than the
English or Welsh, they had discriminated on racial grounds and Mr Greig
should be compensated.
The tribunal will issue its decision later.

''GIVE me a little of a man and I can invent the rest,'' says Ellen
Sheean as Freifrau Von Biberbach in Robert David MacDonald's study of
the enigmatic Caspar Hauser.
Or rather, it is less a study of Hauser, the real-life teenager who
stumbles on to the streets of Nuremburg in 1828 with a repertoire of
just one sentence, as it is a look at the society that took him in.
For Biberbach is not the only one who wants to invent Hauser for
herself. There's the pastor who feels he should ''lay the foundation of
a character'', the professor who believes he can instill a love of
aesthetic, the police chief who thinks he can knock the animal out of
the boy, and the lord who makes him a sexual play thing.
All the while Hauser, played by a startled and vulnerable Daniel
Illsley, remains silent, absorbent, a blank sheet of paper on which
those around him can draw, only to see their own shallow pretentions
reflected back.
MacDonald's play is witty and eloquent, his own production tripping
along, with big rounded performances from a seven-strong cast. This is
enough to hold the attention, but the story, fascinating though it is,
is told too straightforwardly to give it a real dramatic push forward.
There is too little surprise, too few about-turns, and when the
closing coda comes around, in which a newly articulate Hauser comes back
from the dead, his explanations seem too easy a way to wrap up the
play's questions.
At once a psychological detective story, a political intrigue, and the
battle for sexual territory, Persons Unknown never quite fulfils the
promise of any of its parts.

CALLS for safety improvements were made yesterday after two people
died on a bypass dubbed Brands Hatch because of the excessive speed of
drivers who use it.
The head-on crash on the A737 Johnstone bypass brought the number of
deaths on the stretch of road to seven since the #34m extension was
opened two years ago.
In the latest crash, two men travelling in a Ford Escort estate car
were killed when their vehicle smashed head-on into a lorry on a single
carriageway stretch of the road at Howwood, Renfrewshire. This stretch
has been condemned as dangerous by critics of the bypass.
The two men who died were Mr Derek Wilson, 24, of Caledonia Road,
Saltcoats, and his passenger, Mr Donald Currie, 30, of Whitlees
Crescent, Ardrossan. A report will be submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.
Strathclyde's roads officials claim they have done everything to
reduce the risk of accidents.
Following earlier deaths, Mr Donald Carruthers, roads director,
revealed that steps to make conditions safer -- including the
introduction of additional warning signs and road markings -- had been
undertaken. He claimed then that nothing more could be done to improve
the problem.
But last night two MPs stepped up the campaign for an urgent review
and called for immediate action to make conditions safer.
In yesterday's crash, the car in which the two men died became trapped
under the trailer of the heavy goods vehicle, killing those inside
immediately.
Fire service rescue teams used air bags to raise the lorry off the
wreckage to get to the victims.
Assistant divisional officer David Adam said his men had dealt with 40
road accidents, including the seven fatalities, on the single
carriageway section of road.
He said: ''There have been over 30 accidents in which we have been
involved in some form of rescue operation.''
In the wake of the latest accident, Mr Gordon McMaster, Labour MP for
Paisley South, said: ''This has become a notorious accident blackspot.
Whatever is to blame, lives are being put at risk and there has to be an
urgent investigation into the circumstances.''
Mr Tommy Graham, Labour MP for Renfrew West and Inverclyde, who has
already written to the Scottish Office to demand action, added: ''More
needs to be done to leave drivers in no doubt that this stretch of road
is single carriageway south of Kilbarchan.
''I appreciate that in some instances, drivers are going too fast and
perhaps the police could set up speed traps.''
Last night the victims' MP, Mr Brian Wilson, expressed his outrage at
the failure of the Scottish Office and Strathclyde region to do anything
to stop the carnage.
''I have written several times pressing for action to be taken, for
some form of signposting which would make it obvious to drivers they
were travelling on a single carriageway,'' said the Labour MP.
''When I first drove the road I was appalled at the way it switched
from dual to single carriageway.''
Mr Bruce McFee, SNP district councillor for Kilbarchan, said: ''On
this lethal section of road, drivers are going at motorway speeds on
what is a country road with the bends taken out.
''The disastrous lay-out is a result of cost-cutting by the regional
council and they must find a solution to the problem.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde's roads department said he could not
comment on the circumstances surrounding the latest tragedy.
He added: ''At the moment there are no plans to modify or upgrade the
road.''
* The first death occurred just months after the road was opened when
two people died when their cars collided head-on. A month later, a
30-year-old woman was killed in a similar smash.
A 12-year-old boy died in March last year when he was knocked down
while crossing the dual carriageway section just yards from the spot
where the road narrows to single-lane.
In June, a 20-year-old woman died and two of her friends were injured
at another collision on the single-lane stretch.

THERE is something quite marvellous about pulling into Gare du Nord
station aboard Eurostar exactly on time, just three hours from London
Waterloo. From being a Eurostar-sceptic, I cannot see any reason why I
should fly to Paris in future. There's no hassle going through customs,
and luggage is kept with you on the train, so there is no tiresome
hanging around at the other end. No-one even bothered to check passports
on the outward journey.
The train arrives in the centre of Paris in good time for a spot of
light shopping and a trip to an exhibition before dinner.
Judging from the packed carriages containing a cross-section of the
British population, many other people feel the same way. The frequency
of the Eurostar service both to Paris and Brussels is being increased,
in conjunction with the launch of an advertising campaign ahead of the
key summer season. From next year, through-trains will run to Glasgow.
The carriages are more comfortable than the standard British Rail
ones, there is no standing , and the train is definitely on a par with
British Airways. We had been warned about the unappetising food on the
train, so we had stocked up beforehand. Travelling last weekend as a
surprise birthday treat from my husband, there was just one moment of
trepidation when the guard announced that we were about to enter the
tunnel.
Looking around the carriage I could tell I was not alone in trying
(unsuccessfully) to appear nonchalent about the fact that several
thousand tons of water were just above my head. However, it is only 20
minutes in the tunnel and no different to travelling on the Underground.
Familiarity grows when, on venturing up the Rue de Rivoli to our
hotel, we spotted a host of British outlets, including Marks &amp; Spencer,
Barclays, Etam, and Pizza Hut. There was also C&amp;A and the ubiquitous
McDonald's.
WHILE the tunnel connects us physically to Europe, as a nation we
remain Euro-sceptics and are probably right to be so, at least when it
comes to matters economic. We are constantly led to believe this is
where our future as a trading nation lies. The almost exclusive focus on
Europe by some of our politicians seems misguided. Britain has historic
trading ties with many parts of the world dating back from the empire.
It is hard to fault the observation made by Lord Young, executive
chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, at the recent Institute of Directors
annual convention in London, when he noted that it was the West India
Trading Company and later the East India Trading Company that led the
way ''and we were doing fine in world markets until the administrators
and politicians got into the act''.
Indeed it is in these newer developing regions of India, China, Latin
America, and latterly the former Eastern Bloc, that the biggest
potential economic growth will come. The Indian economy is forecast to
grow at between 6% and 8%, while China has been growing in excess of 10%
per annum for the past two years.
That compares with projections for a relatively paltry 3% growth rate
in Europe as the economies struggle out of recession. The population of
China alone is over one billion people, all eager to acquire Western
consumer goods and services. This represents a tremendous opportunity
for our manufacturers.
It is perhaps not surprising that the politicians will want to focus
on Europe, given its geographic proximity, and moves at varying paces
towards economic and monetary union. However, we should not put all our
standardised EU eggs in one basket.
Thankfully many British businesses recognise the attractions of
investing in the developing world. Greenock-based British Polythene
Industries, Europe's largest polythene film producer, and
telecommunications group Cable &amp; Wireless have been quick to spot the
attractions of developing markets.
BPI has shifted some of its manufacturing to China, a country in which
Cable &amp; Wireless is also growing strongly. Throughout Europe,
telecommunications markets remain rigged by regulatory means in favour
of national operators, so it's not surprising that they looked
elsewhere.
Meanwhile, back on the train, you knew you were heading back to
England when passports were checked twice -- once by a customs official
who fancied himself as a bit of a wag. Just as we were about to enter
the tunnel, he said aloud that he hoped they'd mended the leak.
0   Then came the announcement that we would be 15 minutes late
because there was a slow train in front of ours. Welcome to Britain.

STAGE star Ruthie Henshall led the tributes to musical legend Jessie
Matthews yesterday at a ceremony which EastEnder Barbara Windsor and
composer Andrew LLoyd Webber also attended.
A Westminster City plaque was unveiled at the Blue Posts public house
in Berwick Street in London's Soho for Matthews, known for her
high-kicking routines in a string of 1930s musicals.
Market traders held a 15-minute silence as a tribute to stallholder's
daughter Matthews, born in a flat above a butcher's shop in Berwick
Street.
She co-starred in films with many of Britain's leading theatrical
knights, including Sir John Gielgud in The Good Companions, Sir Ralph
Richardson in Friday The Thirteenth, Sir Michael Redgrave in Climbing
High and Sir John Mills in The Midshipman.
She was also the first to sing a number of classic hits including Cole
Porter's Let's Do It.
In the 1960s her career took off again as Mrs Dale in the BBC radio
serial The Dales. She also appeared in the 1978 hit TV series Edward And
Mrs Simpson, with Edward Fox.
The original birthplace of Matthews, who died in 1981, aged 74, has
been demolished so the plaque was instead put up above a pub which
overlooked the site of her father's stall.

IRWIN ARIEFF, Paris, Wednesday
CONSERVATIVE Jacques Chirac emerged unscathed from a marathon debate
with Socialist rival Lionel Jospin, preserving his frontrunner status in
the countdown to Sunday's French presidential run-off, commentators said
today.
Both camps claimed victory but analysts called last night's polite,
sometimes dull 135-minute television debate a draw leaving Chirac's
previous lead in the opinion polls intact.
The death of a Moroccan immigrant drowned in the Seine river by
skinheads during an extreme-right National Front march on Monday
overshadowed the final days of the campaign.
Outgoing President Francois Mitterrand and representatives of both
candidates cast wreaths into the Seine in memory of Brahim Bouarram, 29,
and at least 10,000 anti-racist protesters marched through Paris blaming
the National Front and its anti-immigration leader Jean-Marie Le Pen for
his death.
Mitterrand, 78, who had earlier chaired his emotional last cabinet
meeting, expressed condolences to Bouarram's family and told reporters:
''I feel great suffering at this crime, I would not say shame, since it
was not the country that wanted this but a minority of deviants led
astray.''
At a rally an hour later, demonstrators chanted ''Le Pen, fascist,
assassin'' and ''Dissolve the National Front'', while banners proclaimed
''Racism is a National Affront'' and ''A vote for Le Pen is a vote for
hatred''.
Le Pen, who won an unprecedented 15% of the vote in the April 23 first
round, has denied any connection with the murder and called it a
provocation meant to discredit his party.
Police, who said the murderers came from the National Front rally,
rounded up 26 skinheads for questioning at dawn in an effort to track
down those responsible for the murder. Three others had been taken into
custody on Monday.
Both candidates in the TV debate condemned the killing at the outset
and pledged to keep their debate courteous. There were no vicious sound
bites and neither landed a knockout punch.
Since Chirac held an eight to 10-point advantage in the last opinion
polls last weekend, commentators said he appeared safe.
''It was well done but a draw,'' said Alain Duhamel, one of France's
best-known commentators and political authors, who co-chaired the
debate. He predicted that few voters would change their minds based on
the candidates' exchanges.
Both candidates returned to the campaign trail tonight, Chirac holding
a rally in the northeastern city of Metz and Jospin in Paris.
The average audience for the debate was nearly 17 million,
broadcasting authority chairman Herve Bourges said, far less than
forecast and well below the number who tuned into the 1981 and 1988
candidate debates.
During the debate, Jospin, 57, at times lectured the older Chirac like
the economics teacher he once was as they traded arguments on the
economy, unemployment and institutional reform.
But Chirac, the 62-year-old Gaullist Paris mayor and a veteran of
previous such debates, took Jospin's jabs in his stride and fought back
with warnings against a third Socialist term following Francois
Mitterrand's 14 years at the helm.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Scots nurseries praised for innovative childcare</HEADLINE>

0TWO Scottish nurseries were praised yesterday as examples of the
innovative childcare centres which should be developed throughout
Europe.
The facilities in Portree and Gareloch were highlighted in a new
report because they ensure children from rural areas have access to good
quality care.
The report on childcare services for rural families for the European
Commission Network on Childcare urged the EC to lead by example.
It said that, with European funding matched at home by central or
local government projects tailored to local needs, life could soon
change for children and families in rural communities -- and that, in
turn, would stop the exodus from remote areas.
The report's author, director of Children in Scotland and the UK
representative for the Network, Dr Bronwen Cohen, said: ''Research has
shown that one of the main reasons people move from these areas is the
lack of services such as schools.''
When the hall used by playgroups in Portree was demolished to make way
for council offices, parents were left without premises.
However, with the help of Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise, they extended
their provision to include childcare and made a successful application
for European funding, qualifying under the Leader programme because jobs
were to be provided and parents enabled to take up training and work.
The nursery now provides full and part-time care for 19 children as
well as premises for a playgroup and toddler group and a pre-school
session from a teacher. It has created five jobs and allowed 19 parents
to work.
In Gareloch, the Toy Box Nursery, also set up by local mothers for
pre-school children, offers care during the summer holidays and is open
to visitors' children during the tourist season. An out-of-school club
due to open in Ullapool shortly will also provide facilities for
visiting children.
At present, the UK is bottom of the childcare league table in Europe.
In Scotland, 35-40% of children between three and school age have
publicly-funded childcare -- in contrast to 95% in Belgium and France,
85% in Italy and Denmark, followed by Germany, Greece, and Spain with
65-70%.
British children could be helped from the bottom of the childcare
ladder with aid from the European Union's structural funding programmes,
according to Dr Cohen.
In every EU country childcare is concentrated in urban areas which
means there are many rural areas with no provision at all.
Dr Cohen commented: ''Even in very rural countries, childcare
structures are based on urban perceptions, which may not be appropriate
for small, scattered rural communities.
''Women in Greece left their work in the fields to tell us how they
were forced to leave their babies in hammocks because, despite their
complex childcare structure, there was nothing in rural areas.
''Similarly, the UK Government has made funding available for
out-of-school care, but that is of limited use if there is no pre-school
care available.''

AN update on the progress of the two greyhounds owned by Willie
McKelvey, the MP for Kilmarnock who takes more than a passing interest
in four-legged sports where there is a wager involved. Labour Victory is
living up to his name and won at Shawfield on Tuesday night.
Labour Leader is also living up to his name. He is a very impressive
performer but has a tendency to turn and smile at the crowd as he runs.
He hasn't won anything yet.
WE tried not to mention the war. Then someone showed us a copy of the
Sunday Express magazine special on VE-Day. Yes, the one with the
full-page advert for skin products from Vichy Laboratoires. Moving on
from collaborationist Froggy swine, we spot that the Hun feature in the
form of an ad for Audi's Vorsprung durch Technik. Not one but two
adverts from Honda who should surely have waited for the VJ-Day
celebrations. No sign of any Italian products but that's typical of the
Eyeties. Show up bloody late and go home early.
* A group of workers at Motorola in Livingston were upset at not
getting next Monday's VE-Day holiday. The foreman confronted them and
asked if any of them even knew what VE-Day stood for. Silence. He
explained it meant Victory in Europe. ''Thank God we didnae beat
Denmark,'' came a voice at the back.
* Among the VE-Day memorabilia we will not be buying the compact disc
There'll Always Be an England, ''a rousing and poignant collection of 24
original recordings of wartime songs''.
* In our VE-Day mailbag we find an invitation from Hyndland Parish
Church of Scotland, Glasgow, to a street party. It asks: ''How would you
like your photograph taken wearing a gas mask?'' Can only be an
improvement, we say.
* Presumably not having a VE-Day celebration, is Moshi Moshi, the
Japanese restaurant in Buccleuch Street, Glasgow. (Excellent barbecued
chicken in teryaki sauce by the way.) We mention it because, despite
writing about this place before, we had not realised the name means
literally ''Hello, Hello''. Japanese for ''how do you do'' and ''we are
the boys in royal blue'' in due course.
First with the news
A NAE LUCK award to two of Grampian TV's newshounds based in the
Western Isles. Their station having covered the police National
Speedwatch campaign, the two found out how it works in practice.
Reporter Marianne Mackenzie who appears, we are told, on something
called Tellyfish (but we could have got our Gaelic wrong) was done for
zooming her way to work in Stornoway in the Grampian blue estate car.
Cameraman Chris Macdonald made it a double as he made his way at speed
to a pressing engagement in Uist. An interesting concept, an urgent
appointment in Uist.
A-D of Doric
THE Scottish Cultural Press, the Aberdeen-based publishers which
brought us the best-selling Learn Yourself Doric, has branched out into
children's books.
First from its new imprint, the Scottish Children's Press, is An A-Z
of Scots Words for Young Readers. The Diary is only up to D but has
already learned much. We can construct entire sentences such as:
Aiblins I'll eat an abrico aff an ashet ahint the ark. Perhaps I will
eat an apricot off an oval serving plate behind the chest for storing
grain.
The birkie birk had a byordinar breenge wi his baffies at the bawkie
in the bourtree. The smart or lively well-built boy made an unusual or
extraordinary attempt to batter the bat in the elder tree with his
slippers.
It was an awfy chave and caused a carfuffle but I managed to get the
chappit cabok down the caddie's craig. It was something of a struggle
and created a certain amount of disorder but I succeeded in persuading
my pet lamb to eat the mashed cheese.
Dinna deave me, doo, when I'm playing a dambrod. Please do not disturb
me, sweetheart, when I am attempting to play a game of draughts.
Further evidence, if it were needed, that Doric is a living language.
It comes from my old chum and travelling folkie Danny Kyle. He tells us
of a loon trying to score drugs at a rave in Furryboots City who kept
asking for ''some o' yon kenfitahmeans''.
Wee half
THIS tale is obviously apocryphal but that has never stopped us
before. Two of Strathclyde polis's finest are driving past the Royal
Infirmary when they spot a pregnant woman leaning against a bus stop,
shaking uncontrollably. They rush over to help her but discover she is,
in fact, laughing her head off.
She tells them she has been told to take a urine sample to the
hospital. All she could find to put it in was an empty whisky half
bottle. Which someone has stolen from her handbag.
Bluetered
WE asked for examples of behaviour which might suggest that the person
concerned is in a state of inebriaton. Jim Nicol suggests that anyone
eating a kebab must be drunk since no-one would try one sober.
Dave Stormonth of Paisley wins the bottle of hooch with his tale of
the time a chum of his was so obviously blootered that he was singing
The Sash at the Rangers end at Hampden. Nothing unusual there, you might
say.
But it was midnight. He had been to the Celtic-Rangers cup final that
day and had gone on to celebrate. He was still celebrating when he
passed by Hampden late at night.
He decided to clamber over the wall and entertain the residents in the
vicinity of the national stadium to a few more party tunes. Amazingly
enough, one of them phoned the polis.

<HEADLINE>Overspend fears end in relief after #200,000 'error' found</HEADLINE>

SOCIAL work chief Malcolm Smith cut short his holiday when it was
thought that another huge overspend had been found in his department's
accounts at Western Isles Council.
But at a crisis meeting called by the council leadership, it was found
the #200,000 ''overspend'' was due to a ledger error made by a junior
clerk.
The previous social work director quit a few months ago after
overspending of #600,000 sparked severe cutbacks.
Waves of relief among the islands' council bosses over the latest
feared crisis gave way to self-congratulation.
They admitted the #200,000 accounting blunder had happened, but
immediately praised the council's own financial monitoring system for
discovering the error so soon.
Mr Smith, the acting director of social work, was on holiday in
Glasgow when internal auditors found his department's figures did not
tally in a report being prepared for the social work committee.
Council spokesman Nigel Scott said: ''Raw figures on the financial
management system (FMS) indicated there could be a further spending
problem and, by getting people together, this was the quickest way of
ascertaining the true position.''
A crisis meeting of the council leadership, including social work and
finance chiefs, was called for the following day, Saturday, April 15.
The council would not confirm claims that there was a #200,000 error
in the accounts.
The spokesman would only say: ''It is no longer relevant what raw FMS
figures were indicating.
''The actual sum reported to the social work committee was a further
overspend of only #18,000.'' In a written reply to questions about the
blunder, the council's explanation of the junior clerk's ledger error
was ''a lack of complete follow- through on further adjustments
necessary to the FMS figures''.
Social work committee chairman Mrs Mary Bremner was not at the crisis
meeting, but she said that she had been kept fully informed of
developments from the discovery of the ''overspend'' until its
explanation.
She went on: ''I was delighted the council's staff were conscientious
enough to regard it as a serious matter.''
Mr Smith took over as department chief, on a one-year contract, after
Mrs Norma Macleod quit a few months ago in the aftermath of the #600,000
overspend.
Mrs Macleod resigned after 17 years' service, citing health grounds
due to a stress-related condition which had kept her off work for some
time.
Her assistant director, Mr Bernard Chisholm, then put in his notice
and has also left the council.

<TEXT>
A CHARTERTED accountant who drew up a business plan for a Fife-based
company now at the centre of fraud charges told a court yesterday it
''seemed like a very good business venture''.
Mr John Gardener, 31, who worked for accountants Ernst and Young in
Dundee at the time, agreed that he had considered joining his client's
scheme.
''I handed in my resignation but I never actually joined the
company,'' said Mr Gardener, who is now employed by Scottish Enterprise
Tayside.
He was giving evidence on the second day of the trial at Cupar Sheriff
Court of Mr Alexander Lothian of Newgrange Park, Pittenweem.
Mr Lothian denies that, when he was managing director of Litetronics
Lamps (Scotland) Ltd, he formed a fraudulent scheme to obtain money from
investors and -- in November 1991 -- pretended to be a consultant acting
for the Department of Trade and Industry.
Part of one of the two charges he faces alleges that, between
September 1991 and January 1992, he induced Mr Gardener to state in a
business plan that Strathclyde and Tayside regional councils had ordered
thousands of lamps from his company and that its turnover in its first
year of trading would be no less than #2m.
Another part claims that Mr Lothian pretended to others that the first
year's revenue could be as much as #7.15m.
Mr Lothian also denies inducing a man to pay him more than #1700 in
1992 while pretending to be a DTI consultant.
During yesterday's hearing Mr Anthony Moxham, 55, of Coventry, a
former managing director of Litetronics Lamps Ltd in England, said that
he understood that Mr Gardener, in getting the Scottish company up and
running, was investing #10,000 of his own money.

THE Greenpeace campaigner leading the team which has occupied Shell's
Brent Spar North Sea installation last night told The Herald: ''We are
here to stay until the UK Government and Shell decide to take care of
the marine environment.''
Tim Birch also pledged the team would stay on Brent Spar until Shell
decided to abandon its plan to dump the redundant tanker-loading
terminal in the Atlantic.
Mr Birch also accused the Government of being interested only in
protecting oil companies, chemical companies and industry, and not in
protecting the environment.
Mr Birch said that there were a dozen men and women on board the
installation 118 miles north-east of Shetland, as well as members of the
German, Dutch and UK media.
An advance team had carried out a number of safety checks before they
had entered the accommodation module.
''Shell very kindly left us some cans of food, and we are also using
the microwave they left. We have our own generator, so we have light and
are able to heat water. Shell also left duvets and mattresses.''
He said the protesters had no trouble obtaining stores, and had been
loading up in shuttle runs to Shetland.
''It is a bit of a maze, like a spaceship, like Star Trek, and we are
beginning to investigate to see what information we can gather about
Shell. But we are checking very carefully. We are fully aware of safety
procedures.''
He said they hoped to carry out scientific monitoring of the sea
around the installation during their stay.
''The oil industry is the worst regulated industry in the UK. In one
year alone rigs dumped 80,000 tones of chemicals in the North Sea.''
Shell has so far taken no action to attempt to remove the protesters.

Zagreb, Wednesday
REBEL Serbs agreed an immediate ceasefire today after a second day of
deadly rocket attacks on Zagreb in retaliation for a Croatian army
offensive that overran one of their enclaves.
An accord drafted by UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi guaranteed that
Serb civilians and soldiers would be allowed to leave the Western
Slavonia pocket under UN protection for safety in neighbouring Bosnia.
''I have words of honour from both sides to implement the agreement,''
Mr Akashi told reporters.
The deal dampened concern that the Croatian offensive and the Serb
response might flare into a wider war with dangerous consequences for
the Balkan region. A four-month-old ceasefire in Bosnia expired on
Monday.
Meanwhile, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman today promised further
military action if Serbs attacked Zagreb again.
''I want to let them (Serb leaders) know that if they repeat another
such criminal attack, the Croatian state will respond most decisively in
order to stop futher terrorism,'' he said in a televised address.
Tudjman said civil rights for minority Serbs in recaptured territory
would be respected.
An accord drafted by UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi guaranteed that
Serb civilians and soldiers could leave the Western Slavonia pocket
under UN protection for safety in neighbouring Bosnia.
The Serbs hit Zagreb with Orkan rockets today, killing a policeman and
wounding 43 people including a British ballet dancer and about 20
Russian and Ukranian nationals.
Mark Bolden, 27, from Kent, who has spent most of his life in Germany
where his mother lives, was training with the Croatian National Ballet
at a theatre in the city when a rocket bomb crashed through the roof.
British Embassy spokesman Chris Poole said: ''He is in hospital
undergoing surgery for abdominal shrapnel wounds. His condition is not
serious.''
Five people died in the elegant Croatian capital yesterday in a first
attack with Orkans which carry cluster bomb warheads that spray shrapnel
over a wide area.
The rockets were in response to the army's recapture of the the
Western Slavonia pocket, part of the rebel Republic of Serb Krajina
(RSK) which Serbs set up on captured Croatian soil in 1991.
The policeman died today while trying to defuse a cluster bomb caught
in a tree at the main children's hospital.
Motorists abandoned cars and ran for shelter and trams stopped in
Zagreb amid the thud of the exploding Orkans.
Croatia said presidential adviser Hrvoje Sarinic would attend peace
talks called with both sides in Geneva on Friday by the International
Conference on former Yugoslavia (ICFY).
EU representative Lord Owen told a news conference the invitation was
also sent to the self-styled president of the Croatian Serbs, Milan
Martic.
Lord Owen made clear one of his main aims was to head off any slide
into a new war between Croatia and its neighbours in the rump
Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro. ''That is the big one . . . the
extremely dangerous one,'' he said.
In Western Slavonia, defeated Serb soldiers surrendered their heavy
guns as Croatia brushed aside appeals to turn over the recaptured
enclave to UN peacekeepers.
Croatian police in the pocket said the rebels were handing artillery,
mortars and other weapons to the UN.
Croatia has regained control of a strategic motorway and railway line
between Zagreb and its eastern provinces for the first time since its
Serb minority rebelled against independence four years ago.
Cluster bombs riddled Zagreb's Children's Hospital as staff rushed
hundreds of bewildered patients into a basement shelter.
A piece of flesh lay on a balcony above the hospital courtyard where
the policeman died handling a bomblet which had been caught in a tall
plane tree.
''This is part of the jaw of the man who tried to defuse the thing,''
hospital director Ivan Fattorini told a party of visibly shocked
ambassadors to Croatia who toured the scene of the attack three hours
afterwards.
He pointed to a thick pool of blood on the cobbled yard beneath the
tree where 35-year-old officer Ivan Markulin was killed instantly. His
corpse, peppered with shrapnel wounds above the waist, had no
recognisable face.
Most of the windows on three sides of the five-storey hospital complex
were riddled by thousands of ball bearings sprayed indiscriminately by
the weapons, or shattered by the blasts. Piles of broken glass littered
the corridors.
The hospital appeared to have suffered the heaviest damage in today's
attack.
Using a model of his 300-bed clinic, Fattorini showed where three
cluster-bomb missiles had struck within yards of each other just minutes
after noon, wrecking the main operating theatre, a gynaecology ward and
a neuro-pediatric unit. A fourth went off in the street nearby, he
said.--Reuter.

I AM writing this aboard an aircraft. At the present time my natural
habitat appears to be at 25,000 feet and I want to tell you the living
is not easy. Why is it, one wonders, that air travel often takes longer
and is definitely a bigger pain than it ever was? Back in the days when
propellers went round I flew in Dakotas, some of which had seen war
service. Yet they had seats which were spacious and comfortable; they
took you to London in just over an hour; there was even a late flight
back which allowed discerning types to go to the theatre in the West End
and still journey home the same night.
Contrast this with today's situation. There are far more flights --
though not late in the evening -- but passengers are crowded, cramped,
and delayed almost by design. They are served food they rarely want and
would not choose, starved at times when they are hungry, watered either
not at all or ludicrously over-provided. ''Would you like a liqueur?''
inquired a hostess at 11.50am the other day. No, I am trying to pass on
the morning ports, Miss.
And for all of this wonderful service we are ripped off rotten. The
structure of air fares was devised by a madman; only lunatics ever pay
the full price.
Let me share with you a few of my fun-filled recent experiences. I
flew Sabena business class to Brussels from Edinburgh, paying over #400
return for the privilege. We set off late; there was no hot breakfast;
we were stuck in the stack over the airport; I arrived at my meeting two
hours late.
Coming home the same day I shared in a repeat performance: turned down
the cold dinner, asked instead for a gin and tonic. ''I am only serving
champagne, we are short-staffed,'' came the reply. Compulsory bubbly!
The man seated next to me joked that Sabena as an acronym would apply to
what we were suffering: Such a Bad Experience Never Again. I spotted in
the in-flight magazine that the airline had an ombudsman. In fact, it
boasted of his existence. I wrote to him two weeks ago -- when I left
home on Tuesday he had not replied.
Next time I taught them. Flew British Airways from Brussels to London.
Big mistake.
We boarded on time, belted up as instructed, studied safety leaflet,
sat on Tarmac. ''Ladies and gentlemen,'' purred the captain, a Donald
Sinden voice-a-like, as they all are, ''the computer has gone down. This
means we will have to count you all by hand.''
It took me all of 20 seconds to count us all by hand. Half an hour
later we were still on terra firma.
Eventually we lumbered into the sky. ''We will do everything possible
to make up the time,'' promised DS, and shortly, on my right hand side,
there was Windsor Castle. We were overhead dear old Blighty, chaps.
''It's just not our day,'' sighed the skipper. ''I am afraid we will
have to go round again. During this manoeuvre you may see quite a number
of other aircraft, and some of them may seem quite close.'' Bandits at
six o'clock high. ''Don't worry, we know exactly where they are.''
Oh, that's all right then. Would there be any chance of another cup of
coffee while we toured southern England; a drink perhaps? Not a chance.
Once the chief steward and the flying waitresses lock up the crockery it
stays stowed.
Ultimately, running a bit low on fuel I suspected, we were permitted
to touch down at Heathrow. Unfortunately, our brave pilot may have known
the position of all other aircraft, but he could not locate the bus to
take us to the terminal.
We stood in that half-crouched manner, bags in hand and nowhere to put
them, for fully 15 minutes before Bert arrived with the charabanc. ''Not
my bleedin' fault. I was sent to the wrong bay.''
This is the world's favourite airline we are told, constantly. If that
is true, can you imagine what the others must be like? BA was not
finished with me. To catch the shuttle I had to undergo a Liz
McColgan-length run through the terminal. This is known as progress.
As I finally sank into my seat a man appeared carrying a case in which
all his worldly goods appeared to be stored. Who lets people with
luggage like this board planes? Greedy, inefficient airlines, that's
who.
Folks, I will not bore you with my full repertoire of airline horror
stories. I will pass on Aer Lingus, who sent my bags to Rome instead of
Dublin, the near miss with Air UK -- when I was sitting next to Ted
Heath -- and the day the wheels came off, literally, at East Midlands
airport.
Suffice to say I believe the standards of service offered in air
travel today would not be tolerated in any other business. If British
Rail behaved as badly it would be crucified.
A Passenger Protection Agency is long overdue, and there are votes to
be had for any government which sets one up. Let us have a watchdog with
some real teeth. If electricity prices can be reduced on the orders of a
regulator, why does someone not sort out the robbers in the sky? There
are far too many flights going into Heathrow -- everyone knows that. Yet
the willingness of airlines to change is just not there.
One of the reasons passengers are reluctant to complain is that we are
all still a wee bit scared of flying. As long as they bring us home
safely we don't like to shout too much.
Well I am thoroughly cheesed off paying so much for so little.
Customers unite, you have nothing to lose but your bags, and they are
quite liable to do that anyway.
By the way, if you catch sight of me at an airport, do yourself a
favour . . . take another flight.

The Government has been asked to publish details of its environmental
record in the North Sea, and in particular the number of disused oil
rigs it has allowed companies to abandon.
In a series of Parliamentary questions tabled yesterday, Labour MP
Norman Godman has asked President of the Board of Trade Michael
Heseltine to list the number and location of redundant off-shore
installations, and the instances in which operators have been asked to
dismantle them.
Dr Godman, who has tabled the same questions annually since 1987, and
who sat on the Parliamentary committee considering the Petroleum Bill
which regulates the disposal of off-shore installations, said fishermen
are particularly affected.
The 1987 Petroleum Act gives Mr Heseltine statutory powers to instruct
rig and pipeline operators to dismantle and remove structures. Dr Godman
has asked how many times those powers have been invoked.

A SCOTTISH-BASED aid agency is planning to set up Africa's first
fast-reaction aid base from which future mercy missions can be launched.
The centre is to be set up in Kampala, Uganda, later this year, by
Assist UK, a specialist transport and logistics agency which operates
from Renfrew.
The agency has a worldwide fleet of 200 trucks, of which half are at
present helping in the sprawling refugee camps in Zaire.
A further eight trucks will leave Glasgow on Friday bound for Zaire.
The agency was formed by haulier Ian Henderson, who became involved in
aid work 10 years ago and spotted the need for professional transport
and logistic skills to supplement conventional volunteer relief work.
Since then he has worked in Sudan, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Namibia,
Mozambique, Thailand, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and Bosnia.
Under contract to the UN and other international aid agencies, and
hiring mostly local drivers, his agency puts together self-contained
transport and logistics ''packages'' of trucks, bulldozers, generating
equipment and mobile workshops.
The base in Africa, which may be followed by others on the continent,
is being created in an attempt to by-pass the initial expensive stages
of conventional aid operations, in which equipment has first to be
brought in by air.
It will be manned by a skeleton team of British workers and local
personnel, and will also be available to provide help where needed long
after the initial emergency has been tackled.

<HEADLINE>A lesson for new Labour in the post-war adventure</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PEOPLE remember different things for different reasons. Next week,
much of the world will mark the 50th anniversary of VE-Day, and rightly
so. Who'll recall July 26, 1945? Hitler was gone, but Japan had yet to
capitulate. On May 15, Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labour, had announced
that demobilisation would commence within the month. Given half a
chance, Churchill would have kept coalition government alive, but Labour
wanted its election.
Whatever common purpose had been forged during the conflict evaporated
at the hustings. Broadcasting on June 4, Churchill said: ''I declare to
you that no socialist system can be established without a political
police. They would have to fall back on some sort of Gestapo.''
It was a bizarre misjudgment of an exhausted country's mood -- an
insulting piece of propaganda that seemed designed to prove, once and
for all, that the war aims of the people and the aims of its leader had
been vastly different things. Clement Attlee's party won with a
landslide: 393 seats -- a majority of 146.
Looking back on that election gives a better sense of how Britain has
changed than any social trends survey. Labour's first clear victory
shaped an entire society, transforming the ways by which the British
were educated, employed, housed, and cared for. More than anything, it
permitted people to believe the state had a duty to its people. It took
35 years, and the purblind enmity of Margaret Thatcher, for that
consensus to be smashed.
Compare Attlee's government with a new Labour Party anticipating its
own landslide five decades later, and you are reminded how much was
achieved then, and how much has been squandered since. New Labour has
become diffident about history recently: 1945 perhaps helps to explain
why. Knowing what was done then, it might not do to have people ask why
so many things are being declared impossible now.
The scale of the challenge facing Attlee, that least rabid of men, can
hardly be exaggerated. At the war's end, one-third of Britain's gold
reserves and overseas assets had gone. Half a million houses had been
destroyed, another quarter of a million badly damaged. The country owed
#3500m (perhaps #70bn at today's prices), and five million people had to
be demobilised and found work. In August of 1945, just after Japan's
surrender, Truman suspended Lend-Lease.
Faced with such a catastrophe, most governments would have devoted
their time to devising plausible fibs. Instead, Attlee embarked on a
huge legislative programme in the face of every obstacle the
establishment could contrive. The list is astonishing even today. Thus:
* 1946: the Bank of England Act; the Coal Industry Nationalisation
Act; the Civil Aviation Act; the National Insurance Act; the National
Health Service Act; the Housing Acts.
* 1947: the Electricity Act; the Transport Act; the Town and Country
Planning Act; the Agricultural Act.
* 1948: the Gas Act, the Children Act, and the Monopolies and
Restrictive Practices Act.
* 1949: the Rent Control Act and the Iron and Steel Act.
Public ownership, in other words, combined with full employment and
the implementation of the Beveridge Report -- a free health service,
comprehensive social security, and decent education. Amid all this,
Attlee even managed to grant India its independence.
What is striking, given that the modern Labour Party has learned to
love Trident and all things nuclear, is that it was defence, not
nationalisation or the welfare state, that ended the Attlee adventure.
The attempt to rebuild a shattered domestic economy while maintaining
troops in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East was
unsustainable. Add the Korean War, which saw defence spending quadruple,
and American interference with sterling (the usual price of US loans),
and you begin to see what went wrong.
But there are lessons here yet if new Labour cares to heed them. By
1948 British exports had reached their 1938 levels. Under the guidance
of Stafford Cripps -- but with the crucial help of the TUC -- capital
investment took priority over consumption. Full employment was
maintained and society transformed. The promises no-one now dares make
were made and kept, and kept because it was for these things that
ordinary people had fought.
Contrast Attlee's government with a party proposing to pay us all the
huge compliment of safeguarding our inalienable rights as ''consumers'';
a party in retreat from the belief that governments have a duty to
intervene on behalf of their people; a party in which any mention of the
commanding heights of the economy is guaranteed to raise a laugh.
The irony is, perhaps, that neither Attlee nor his Cabinet regarded
themselves as radicals. Their duty was to economic justice, the simplest
of ideals, and when they sang the Red Flag in the chamber of the Commons
upon taking power, there were no image-makers around urging them to
re-position their brand and give up such old-fashioned nonsense.
Like Tony Blair, ''little Clem'' did not promise what he did not mean
to deliver. Unlike the new leader, he didn't go on about it quite as
much.
Asked in 1950 if he had anything to say about Labour's forthcoming
election campaign, he gave a full and frank answer: ''No''.
We could do with more like him.

<HEADLINE>Victims pledge to continue cash fight Thalidomide plea to Major</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978567416</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THALIDOMIDE victims pledged to carry on the fight for more money after
receiving an extra #2.5m a year for the next 15 years.
The cash from Guinness, announced yesterday, is to help pay for the
future needs of 460 handicapped beneficiaries.
Freddie Astbury, chairman of the Thalidomide Action Group, demanded a
meeting with the Prime Minister and said the Government should
contribute to the fund.
''We are very thankful to Guinness and I hope people do not think we
are being selfish. It sounds a lot of money to the man in the street but
it has to be shared by 460 of us,'' he said.
''We want to meet Mr Major and discuss this with him, not one of his
Ministers. It is not the end of our campaign.''
Mr Astbury, 34, from Merseyside, was born without arms and legs after
his mother took Thalidomide during pregnancy.
He said news of the extra money had come without warning. ''We are
rather unhappy that Guinness gave us no prior warning of this,'' he
added.
Guinness took over the Distillers company, whose subsidiary made the
Thalidomide drug, in 1986 after looking at the financial state of the
trust that distributes cash to the victims.
A Guinness spokesman said: ''It was decided to do this when we looked
at the financial position of the trust at the end of 1994.
''We have had a number of meetings with them and were very impressed
with the way they had been running things. But it did need topping up
and it was decided to give extra funding to help secure the future for
the victims.''
The action group had campaigned vigorously for more cash to help pay
for special housing, transport and equipment.
They argue doctors never believed they would live into adulthood,
marry and have families and the original court settlement was not big
enough to meet long-term needs. The Government should contribute towards
the fund they claim.
Only two weeks ago TAG met Department of Health officials and a report
will be sent to Ministers in June.
A Department of Health spokesman said: ''Compensation is not part of
the remit and it is a matter for Guinness.''
However, in recent months there have been growing fears the trust, set
up in 1973 with help from Distillers, would run out of money in the
early part of the next century.
Distillers entered into court-approved settlements with Thalidomide
victims and paid out #33m with no admission of liability.
Thalidomide Trust chairman Lord Griffiths said: ''The trustees very
much appreciate this generous level of financial support from Guinness,
which, I am confident, will bring a high degree of comfort and
reassurance to all our beneficiaries.
''It is a fine example of a major corporation playing its part to
support a real need.
''We recognise that the tragedy of Thalidomide occurred very many
years before Guinness acquired Distillers. We also recognise that
Guinness has no legal liability to make these payments.''
Guinness chairman Tony Greener said: ''We believe that the Thalidomide
Trust has provided responsible and caring support for the beneficiaries
over the past 22 years and we want to make sure that, with extra
financial support, they will continue to be able to do so.''
He added: ''As a result of this move, we hope that the Government will
now be encouraged to consider further help for the beneficiaries.''

A FORMER policeman who was jailed for three months for indecent
assault had his sentence reduced by three appeal court judges yesterday.
Instead, Gary Turner will serve 150 hours' community service.
However, the judges at the Justiciary Appeal Court rejected Turner's
appeal against his conviction, ruling that Falkirk Sheriff Andrew Murphy
had been entitled to find him guilty.
The decision to reduce the sentence infuriated the father of the two
sisters Turner had been convicted of assaulting.
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ''This is
ridiculous. This isn't justice. What happened to my girls has left them
emotionally scarred for life.
''The younger girl has had to have psychiatric care to to help her
deal with the terrible trauma caused by Turner.
''Now Turner has walked free and his only punishment is likely to be
sweeping the streets. He even got out of the police with a pension and
was allowed to buy his police house.
''Where is the justice in this case?
''What he did is unforgiveable. The sheriff who heard the case
sentenced Turner to jail -- and that's where he should be.''
Turner, of Forbes Road, Falkirk, was convicted last October of charges
of indecent assault against the women, one of whom was a special
constable at the time. That assault took place in 1990.
In the second incident, three years later, he indecently assaulted the
woman's sister, who was 20 at the time.
Turner, 30, who was based in Denny, was suspended pending the trial
and has now lost his job with the force.
Following his conviction, he lodged an appeal and was released on
interim liberation almost immediately.
Yesterday, Lord Sutherland, sitting with Lords Johnston and Wylie,
decided that the sheriff had gone too far in jailing Turner when there
was a viable alternative of community service.
He noted the accused was a first offender who had lost his job.
Lord Sutherland added: ''The offences themselves were of course of an
unpleasant nature. On the other hand, it can be said that as soon as
they told him to stop what he was doing he did so.''
He had also taken the view that the offences were not the most serious
examples of indecent assault.

A MAN of 32 is expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court today in
connection with an incident on board a British Airways aircraft making
its final approach to Glasgow Airport.
Police were alerted by the captain of the Boeing 757 aircraft which
was arriving from Boston and New York that there had been an incident
and requesting that the plane be met.
Officers were waiting at the airport and escorted a man from the
plane. He was taken into custody and later charged with what is
understood to be a breach of the Air Navigation Order.
Those regulations make it an offence to behave in a manner which is
likely to put an aircraft, its passengers or crew in danger.

A FATHER travelling the world in a horse-drawn caravan with his family
has escaped a jail sentence after a Mongolian court found him guilty of
deliberate wounding.
David Grant, from Orkney, yesterday received a three-year sentence,
reduced to two years and suspended, after an incident last October
during which a Mongolian man was blinded in one eye.
However, shortly after the court hearing in the capital, Ulan Bator,
an appeal was lodged preventing Mr Grant from leaving Mongolia.
The former broch-keeper had been travelling the world with his wife
Kate and their three children Torcuil, 15, Eilidh, 13, and Fionn, 10,
after leaving Orkney four years ago.
Mr Grant -- speaking from his flat in Ulan Bator -- said a group of
drunken Mongolian men had tried to steal one of their horses while the
family was camping overnight during their journey across Mongolia.
Daughter Eilidh, afraid for her father's safety, had fired a catapult
at them. After a series of delays the case went to court this week.
Earlier Mr Grant said he had attempted to settle the matter out of court
by offering the injured man #1000 but the man had said in court this had
amounted to a bribe. Mrs Grant returned to Britain a month ago after her
father became ill.
Mr Grant said: ''I don't know if Eilidh hit this man but we accept
that she may have. If she did, it was in self-defence.
''Everything here is like candyfloss, once you touch it you get stuck.
I would warn other Britons that this is a very dangerous place.''
The British ambassador has expressed his concern at the severity of
the sentence to the local authorities.

THE Hebridean island of Scarp, launching pad for an ill-fated rocket
mail experiment in the 1930s, is up for sale.
The 2488-acre island off the west coast of Harris is being sold by
receivers for Orbitglen, a property company.
Mr Nazmudin G. Virani, jailed for fraud last year over his business
dealings with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is a
director of the company.
Estate agents are looking for offers of more than #75,000 for Scarp
which can boast an annual income from crofting rents of #47.
Rich philatelists could prove major bidders. In 1934, German inventor
Gerhardt Zucher packed an experimental postal rocket with mail to fire
to the mainland.
It included four letters addressed to King George V, a keen stamp
collector, and another from the Harris branch of the British Legion to
the Prince of Wales. A letter to the Scottish Secretary encouraged him
to eat more herring, a staple source of island income.
However, the rocket exploded on take-off. A few letters with the
distinctive 1[1/2]d stamp and special postmark survived.

A SCHEME has been launched to make science more appealing to
teenagers.
Scotland's share of the #1m Pupil Researcher Initiative, which aims to
encourage teachers, scientists, and engineers to make science education
more relevant and interesting, is about #100,000.
Dr Susan Burr has been seconded from Kyle Academy in Ayr, where she is
a principal teacher in science, to implement the programme throughout
Scottish secondaries.
It will be targeted at pupils aged 14-16, although there are hopes it
will have a spin-off on science literacy among other pupils and the
wider community.
Dr Burr said yesterday that there was scope to introduce more
investigative work by pupils into Standard Grade science courses.
''A research-type approach and more investigations would make science
more interesting and relevant for young people,'' she said.
Pupil investigations are an important part of the programme for five
to 14-year-olds, which is gradually being introduced into Scottish
primary schools and the first two years of secondary education.
At UK level, about 30 research projects are being produced for
schools. Part of Dr Burr's secondment will involve adapting them for
Scottish education.
The projects, which will cover many areas including the environment
and waste management, are intended to ensure that pupils get the most
out of knowledge allied to investigations and research in order to
encourage practical learning and teamwork.
Dr Burr will also help schools organise science fairs to generate
interest among local communities.
Under the initiative, postgraduate students will visit schools with
the aim of passing on their enthusiasm for science, while schools will
be funded to allow some teachers to spend a week or two in university
research departments.
Concern has been expressed about a drop in the number of pupils south
of the Border gaining A-Level science qualifications, particularly in
physics and chemistry.
Although more Scottish pupils are gaining science Highers,
educationalists agree there is room for improvement.
Mr Terry Hudson, a senior lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University and
one of the project's co-ordinators, said: ''This is not just a
recruitment drive for science. Living today requires some science
literacy, even for young people who are not going on to careers in
science.''

A COUNCIL has been branded ''inefficient and insensitive'' for its
pursuit of a young woman for poll tax charges which she is not due to
pay.
Despite Lothian Regional Council admitting it made errors in the case,
a series of letters and communications from sheriff officers has
continued to plague Mrs Anne Raeside, who now lives in Lugar Avenue,
Irvine.
Now, the Labour MP for Cunninghame South, Mr Brian Donohoe, is
demanding an apology from the council and an assurance that the matter
will be closed once and for all.
He said: ''I cannot believe that the council is so inefficient and
insensitive that it continues to bother Mrs Raeside, when it is quite
clear that it has got it all wrong.
''We had all hoped that the ghost of the poll tax had been laid for
ever, but now we discover that there are councils which are pursuing
people who are not due a penny.''
Mrs Raeside, 26, lived in Edinburgh for a year until July 1990, while
studying occupational therapy at Queen Margaret College, then returned
to Irvine.
There was confusion at the time over her community charge liability
and, after a series of problems with Strathclyde Regional Council, she
paid all she was due.
Mrs Raeside said: ''I thought that after all the hassles I had that
would be the end of it. I never tried for a moment to avoid paying what
I was due, but then I started getting letters from Lothian region asking
for money for a period when I was not even in Edinburgh.''
Mr Donohoe was asked to step in and, in July of last year, he received
a letter from Lothian's community charge manager stating that Mrs
Raeside's liability had been cancelled for the period of time and that
the sheriff officers had been called off.
Then, Mrs Raeside's father opened a letter which threatened action by
sheriff officers if a payment of #174.06 was not made at once.
Mrs Raeside said: ''My father was confused and I had to explain that
it was for me, and that it was nothing to worry about.''
A spokeswoman for Lothian region said: ''This was due to an error
between the computers in the assessor's department and the finance
department, and this letter should not have gone out.
''Letters are now on their way to Mrs Raeside and Mr Donohoe
explaining the position and assuring them that this will be an end to
the matter,'' she said.

AN eleventh-hour deal last night stalled a legal showdown over the
fate of #27,000 worth of Lanark Blue cheese -- with environmental health
officers back-tracking on promises to seize the goods.
The dispute over whether or not the ton of cheese should be destroyed
resurfaced yesterday when environmental health officers from Clydesdale
District Council -- who insist that the unpasteurised cheese contains
listeria and is unfit for human consumption -- arrived at Mr Humphrey
Errington's farm in the morning.
But Mr Errington, 50, of Walston Braehead, by Carnwath, Lanarkshire,
refused access to the cheese and the council officers left to seek legal
advice.
They later promised to obtain a sheriff's warrant, which would give
them formal permission to take the 44 rounds of cheese.
Mr Errington responded by instructing lawyers to apply for an interim
interdict at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. The interdict would have
effectively stalled any legal action.
The media had been assured that the legal battle would continue today,
but the fighting talk from both sides was replaced by a more
concilliatory tone at the last moment when lawyers managed to thrash out
an agreement preventing the case going back to court.
Under the agreement, the local authority said it would not remove the
cheese from Mr Errington's farm, provided he would not interfere with it
and also allow the authority to inspect his new season batch.
Mr Errington said the latest twist was U-turn by the council. He said:
''They have backed off. They never told me why they wanted to seize it
in the first place, never mind why they have completely turned around
now, but I am relieved nevertheless.
''We assume their apparent reluctance is a sign they are not too
confident of their case. Meanwhile, we are slowly clawing our way
towards a victory, thanks to the court.''
He said the council was entitled to inspect any batch of cheese,
including the 44 rounds under lock and key in deep freezers. He added
that his lawyers would today be seeking a written undertaking from the
council that it will not try to remove the cheese.
The deal follows a series of legal tussles between Mr Errington and
the environmental health department.
First Mr Errington secured a court order preventing the cheese being
destroyed and, only last week, the Court of Session found that the
farmer had been denied natural justice in the original hearing.
Lord Weir said the JP at the original hearing had not given Mr
Errington's lawyers the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and that
the case should be heard before an experienced sheriff.
The council has defended its decision to destroy the cheese. Officers
claim tests showed it contains the bug listeria monocytogenes.
Mr Errington insists it is perfectly safe and that there have been no
reports of illness from customers. The cheese is reputedly a favourite
with the royal family.
Mr Errington said: ''I had been told that they could only take the
cheese if it was not being securely held. Without warning they decided
that was the case, despite the fact this has been going on for five
months.
''I refused them access to the cheese because I was concerned that it
may deteriorate during transportation or not be stored in the correct
conditions at its destination. That could have affected my case when it
is finally heard before a sheriff.''
Mr Errington, who fears the legal dispute may put him out of business,
had said he was prepared to face prosecution by refusing the council
entry to his farm building. And he hinted that he was prepared for a
physical confrontation when he said he was ''as strong a man'' as the
council official who first turned up yesterday.
Ultimately, yesterday's confrontation caused some confusion and
appeared to solve little. First a lorry appeared. The driver jumped out
and produced a photocopied docket for ''14 pallets of cheese''.
A dairy worker told the bemused driver there was no cheese on pallets
and Mr Errington said he could have no access to the premises. The
driver left as two council officials arrived, only to be bombarded by
questions from waiting reporters. Mr Errington, with his wife Diana by
his side, refused them access and questioned their actions before they
left.
Mr Errington said the council had bungled the entire operation by
sending a single driver, who was not an authorised council
representative, to load a ton of cheese.
But the council officials at the farm and director of environmental
health Mr Bob Russell, maintained the authority was acting within its
rights in an attempt to protect the public from a contaminated product.

A WARNING that Scotland cannot rely on the sunrise industries of
Silicon Valley and continuing inward investment for its future
prosperity is given by Labour's Scottish economic spokesman, in a
statement issued today.
Mr John McFall calls for a policy of encouraging new firms to come
into existence, especially in areas such as the supply of components to
the electronics industry.
''This is an area in which we perform particularly badly,'' he says.
''We need to create as much indigenous growth as possible if we are to
build a strong Scottish economy.
''Although we must continue to do our best to attract as much
investment from overseas as we can, we simply cannot rely on that
alone.''
Mr McFall adds that Scotland is vulnerable to any decrease in inward
investment.
Scotland stands to lose nearly 18,000 jobs in electronics over the
next two years, almost 40% of the entire employment base in what was
widely regarded as Scotland's greatest hope for the future.
0 The number of people employed in Scotland's hardware and software
industry will fall from 45,300 to 27,500 by 1997, according to a
Scottish Enterprise report.
''Scotland has every right to be proud of what it has achieved in the
electronics industry in recent years, but this is a fast moving market
which thrives on innovation and if you stand still you are dead,'' Mr
McFall says.
''We have to recognise that we face a tremendous threat from companies
in South-east Asia.''

HE was a verray parfit, gentil knight -- a lover of the countryside, a
keen angler, and an actor of extraordinary versatility whom audiences
loved. Sir Michael Hordern, who has died in hospital aged 83 after a
long illness, could steal a scene effortlessly.
A twitch of an eyebrow, a shrug of cardigan-swathed shoulders, an
expression, be it of distaste, dismay, or glee, flitting across those
wonderfully crumpled, genial features and that was it. He had taken the
evening over, the audience was in his hands to play as he would play a
fish.
He did it on the screen, in the theatre, on television and also on
radio, a medium suited to his fine, expressive voice. His versatility
was such that he could perform roles as diverse as Mr Toad and King
Lear, Jacques and Paddington Bear and be totally credible in them all.
He could play dons and clergymen, gentlemen's gentlemen -- Jeeves was
one of his roles -- and wicked old rakehells to perfection.
He apparently disliked being described as a character actor. The
description tends to imply a player of secondary roles. Sir Michael was
a star actor who tackled the great roles such as King Lear and Prospero
to vast acclaim. (Not that there was acclaim every time. His TV Lear was
allegedly dismissed by one reviewer as being like an Armenian carpet
bagger.)
But when an actor lives so long, as the roles inevitably get smaller
the public perception of the player changes. He belonged to that amazing
generation of British actors stretching from Gielgud, Olivier,
Richardson, and Redgrave to Guinness and Scofield and was their peer.
But to many today it is not the great roles they remember, but the
small, beautifully done performances in his 60-odd films, the parts in
television in Mortimer's Chiantishire and Titmuss tales.
Michael Hordern was born in 1911 in Hertfordshire and, had he followed
the family tradition, would have either gone into the Navy or the
church. After attending Brighton College, he decided to become a school
teacher, but an attack of polio cut his career short. In 1932 he became
a commercial traveller for The Educational Supply Association and took
up amateur theatricals with the St Pancras People's Theatre in London.
It was not until 1937 that he took the plunge, amateur acting having
taken over so much of his time, and made his first professional
appearance playing Lodovico in Othello at the People's Palace, followed
by two seasons with the Little Theatre in Bristol. When war broke out,
he volunteered for the Navy, served as a gunner on convoys, and reached
the rank of lieutenant commander.
He married the actress, Eve Mortimer, in 1943 -- she died in 1986 --
and, after the war turned to the radio to earn his living. It was not
until cast as Ivanov in a production at the Arts Theatre in 1950 that he
achieved his professional breakthrough. Glen Byam Shaw, then director of
the Stratford Memorial Theatre, invited him to join the company in 1950
and in the 1952 season he was given a choice selection of roles in which
to display his range -- Jacques, Menenius, and Caliban. The following
year in the Old Vic 1953-54 season he played Polonius, King John,
Malvolio, and Prospero, further proof that here was an actor of
substance. He played King Lear three times, perhaps the most celebrated
being in the 1969 Nottingham Playhouse production for Jonathan Miller
also seen at the Old Vic.
But if he was a great Shakespearian, and a fine Shavian, equally adept
at playing Sheridan, he was also at home in the plays of John Mortimer,
Alan Ayckbourn, Harold Pinter, David Mercer, and Tom Stoppard -- his
performances in Relatively Speaking and Jumpers were among his greatest
stage successes. His last appearance in the West End was in 1992 in a
revival of Trelawney of the Wells. His health had begun to fail, and his
performance seemed tentative.
A passionate angler, he retired to his cottage in Bagnor on the River
Lambourne hoping to fill his retirement by pursuing his life-long love
-- fishing for trout. Ill health, however, made it increasingly
difficult. In an interview last year, he said: ''Although life has been
kind to me, I am an old man and the body is beginning to show signs of
wear and tear.''
Appointed CBE in 1972, and knighted in 1983, he is survived by his
daughter, Joanna, and his close companion in recent years, the actress
Patricia England.

THE Treasury will have the final say on whether the royal dockyards at
Rosyth and Devonport are to be privatised in a decision expected to be
announced in the summer.
Current Government policy would see both yards go into private hands
next year -- Devonport with the assurance it will refit the UK Trident
and nuclear submarine fleets and Rosyth with a commitment for major
surface ship work.
However, Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman yesterday made it
clear that while the Government is still firmly committed to
privatisation of the dockyards, ''it will not be at any price.''
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind is pushing the case for
privatisation. He will fight the case tooth-and-nail in Cabinet.
However, it was becoming clear last night that the Treasury will have
the final word.
Mr Rifkind's view is that the Government has run this course for so
long it would be wrong to pull out at the final hurdle.
Mr Freeman made it clear yesterday that despite MoD preferences, the
nation might not be prepared to pay the cost of privatisation.
After a prolonged period building up to the anticipated sale of the
yards and their assets he admitted the Government, at the end of the day
still might find itself owner of both yards.
Mr Freeman said the Government had to retain a negotiating position
and the bottom- line solution might be that the cost to the taxpayer of
privatisation might be so high this solution could be ruled out.
If the Government did not maintain this view, then the companies that
now manage both yards could have the country ''over a barrel,'' he said.
A decison not to privatise would not be a U-turn in Government policy,
Mr Freeman said. The Government still was committed to selling off both
yards.
However, he explained, the Treasury might insist that if selling them
meant that the cost was too high then privatisation might not go ahead.
The current situation is that the managers of both Rosyth and
Devonport have put in final bids for each of the yards.
''These are not single paper bids,'' said Mr Freeman, ''They run into
tonnes of documents. Hence the need for negotiations.''
Since these documents were lodged, talks between the Government and
the companies who manage the yards were well under way. The outcome
would determine whether or not the yards would be privatised.
He made it clear that the Treasury was playing an important role in
the negotiations.
The first major disapointment for Mr Rifkind was that when he invited
bids for the royal dockyards, all those companies that had expressed
initial interest -- apart from the two involved in their management --
pulled out of the competition.
The second was that both Rosyth and Devonport management teams put in
what some in the Treasury will regard as derisory bids.

<HEADLINE>Minister accused of 'sneering' at the disabled with attack on fraudsters.  Fury at Lilley 'wheelchairs' jibe</HEADLINE>

SOCIAL Security Secretary Peter Lilley was angrily accused last night
of ''sneering'' at the disabled after he joked about people pretending
to be wheelchair-bound to qualify for benefit under tough new rules.
Disabled groups and Opposition MPs reacted furiously when Mr Lilley
forecast an orchestrated campaign against rule changes which come into
force next month.
He appeared to suggest that fraudsters refused benefit because of
tighter definitions of disability would take to wheelchairs in a bid to
qualify for cash.
However, campaigners fear the new regulations will leave thousands of
people who, through illness or injury, are genuinely incapable of
working, facing severe hardship.
Mr Lilley, anticipating protest about the new incapacity benefit test,
forecast an ''orchestrated, somewhat synthetic campaign against it which
will be organised around the country''.
At a Parliamentary Press Gallery lunch at the Commons, he joked to
journalists: ''We will see, on our television screens, people who have
been refused the benefit and, for the first time in their lives, are to
be seen in a wheelchair.''
Those actually wheelchair-bound, he added, would not have to take the
test.
Labour immediately rounded on Mr Lilley, saying it was ''deplorable''
that he should suggest those opposing the incapacity benefit rule
changes would be prepared to take to wheelchairs on a basis of fraud.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar said Mr Lilley should
worry about the damage he was doing by introducing the new rules, rather
than ''sneer at those who face an uncertain future.
''The Government's own figures suggest that around #3000m lion will be
taken from the benefit for the long-term sick and disabled over the next
three years. You cannot do that without inflicting a great deal of
pain.''
Ms Liz Lynne, the Liberal Democrats' Social Security and disability
spokeswoman, branded Mr Lilley's remarks ''an absolute disgrace''.
She said: ''He has no business being Secretary of State for Social
Security if he has such little understanding of sick and disabled
people.''
Disability campaigners and charities described Mr Lilley's remarks as
''extremely insulting.''
Mr Brian Lamb, head of campaigns for Scope, formerly the Spastics
Society, said: ''This is an absolutely outrageous statement that will
only encourage future unfounded prejudice against disabled people, at a
time when Mr Lilley's own department is sponsoring a Bill which would
eradicate discrimination against disabled people.''
Mr Bert Massie, director of the Royal Association for Disabled and
Rehabilitation, said: ''While you always get a case of someone trying to
defraud the system, it is grave mistake to pick on the whole group.''
Marilyn Howard, policy worker for Disability Alliance, said: ''I am
completely gobsmacked.
''This test is actually going to make it harder for the genuinely
disabled who can't work to get benefit. No tears will be shed if Mr
Lilley were to reconsider his position.''
Later, Mr Lilley hit back, accusing Mr Dewar of ''scaremongering'',
and insisting that wheelchair-users had nothing to fear.
In a statement issued by his department, Mr Lilley said: ''It is
monstrous that Donald Dewar should attempt to scaremonger by suggesting
disabled people will lose benefit.
''Donald Dewar should be ashamed of frightening severely disabled
people.
''Wheelchair-users have nothing to fear from the introduction of
Incapacity Benefit. In fact, wheelchair-users will not even be required
to take the new medical test.''

THE Commons mulled over what could be done about Bosnia. Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd suggested ''keep trying'' was the only formula.
But several Members seemed to think that the limits of humanitarian
intervention were close to being reached.
This is one of these ''we have been here before'' situations. A report
of Balkan affairs in 1913 reflected ''the great powers who hoped to
prevent a war by a European concert, saw their decisions nullified and
their remonstrances disregarded.'' Not much has changed.
One observer in that year described the area as ''one vast madhouse
where sanity seems ridiculous and folly wisdom.''
The evidence that this state of affairs still obtains in Serbia,
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina gives one cause to wonder if the rational
diplomacy of such as Mr Hurd will make much impact on Milosevic and
Karadzic, with their dreams of a Greater Serbia and Tudjman's of a
Greater Crotia which produce a nightmare existence for the people they
rule and the Bosnian Muslims who find themselves in the middle of one of
the greatest national rivalries and mutual hatreds of Europe.
Mr Hurd said that events had ''taken a sharp turn for the worse, which
in the language of diplomacy, means ''has become even more dire.''
No-one could win a war, he said, suggesting that even diplomacy is
beginning to see mutural exhaustion of the combatants as the only way of
getting meaningful peace talks going.
Mr Robin Cook, for Labour, suggested that it was rather odd inviting
President Tudjman to this weekend's VE Day celebration of peace in
Europe when he was head of a government which was currently disrupting
it. Might not the invitation be withdrawn he hinted.
Mr Hurd thought it would better to let him come and tell him we were
displeased with his government's activities and ask them to stop.
The Croats are no better at responding to polite requests than the
Serbs. Mr Cook made the point that if we threaten air strikes against
the Bosnian Serbs and do not go ahead with them, the Serbs would have
successfully called the UN-EU-Nato bluff again.
Mr Menzies Campbell, for the Liberal Democrats, without going into
distasteful historical detail, reminded us that the Germans had some
influence with the Croats and called for Kohl to be wheeled on to see
what he could do. One of the few comforting reflections in this session
was that in Messrs Hurd, Cook and Campbell the parties have men of good
Foreign Secretary calibre even if only one so far has had a crack at the
job.
Mr David Howell who, as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select
Committee, is as well-informed as anyone, thought plans to withdraw the
UN troops should be reviewed perhaps even on an hourly basis. Mr Hurd
said ''a ragged peace'' existed in Bosnia but conceded it could
''degenerate into total war.''
The unfortunate people of the region, he said, had been propelled by
their rulers back into a timewarp of the first decade of this century
and the last decade of the nineteenth. The parallels are certainly
striking. Then, as now, the greater powers of Europe pleaded with one or
other or all sides of the conflict to stop and were ignored.
Then, of course, Britain had no troops involved. The Commons, paying
well-deserved tribute to their brave humanitarian work, seemed to be
coming round to the view that they may soon have to be extricated from
the midst of a conflict which nobody seems to know how to stop.

DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind yesterday unveiled the probable new
worldwide role for British troops in the wake of eventual agreement in
the Northern Ireland peace talks.
In a White Paper outlining the Government's future defence policy, he
forecast a situation where the armed forces will take on more and more
global duties on behalf of the United Nations and other organisations,
including the Western European Union.
These would be similar to the peace-keeping operation currently being
performed by UK troops in Bosnia, and British involvement in other
trouble-spots such as Rwanda and Angola.
Mr Rifkind disclosed that as a first stage, from next year, a
permanent joint headquarters will be set up to anticipate crises in
various parts of the world that could lead to the deployment of UK
troops.
The headquarters will bring together all the resources of the three
Services with an intelligence input.
They are being given the task of forecasting the likely trouble-spots
that will involve the deployment of British troops.
The Government White Paper on defence estimates -- ''Stable Forces in
a Strong Britain'' -- published yesterday predicted that in future there
would be greater involvement by UK troops globally.
It recognises a growing appreciation within the armed forces that with
the huge sums being invested in the UK defence budget, the military has
to face the prospect of either using their resources, or losing them.
Despite an initial reluctance by the military and the Government to
get involved in operations in the former Yugsoslavia, the White Paper
highlights a new enthusiasm to continue similar tasks.
Accepting the possibility that the situation in the former communist
republic could deteriorate overnight -- leading to Nato plans to be put
into effect for a huge reinforcement to pull out British troops on
peace-keeping duties -- -- Mr Rifkind enthused over the likely
involvement of British troops being deployed elsewhere in the world on
similar operations.
However, the White Paper makes it clear that the UK would not respond
positively to each and every call made by the UN.
Nevertheless, it insists that the UK remains both economically and
militarily in the first league.
''We will continue to be a major participant in world affairs, willing
and able to lead decisively rather than to follow,'' it states.
The paper says that for the first time in 25 years there were grounds
for hoping a permanent peace in Northern Ireland was achievable.
Despite the positive developments in the Province, the White Paper
says there would be no cuts in the UK's front line forces.
''Instead, for our Servicemen and women it will mean more time for
their families, more time for training, and more time to apply their
expertise and professinal skills on the global stage.''
Mr Rifkind emphasised the importance of the new permanent joint
headquarters which he announced is to be based at Northwood, North
London.
He forecast a period of constant turmoil in various parts of the globe
that could involve a British military presence.
''There will be growing calls on the UK to respond to a range of
crises in this unpredicatable world,'' Mr Rifkind said.
''Our ability to react quickly to stabilise a situation before it
deteriorates will be put to the test frequently.
''The new permanent joint HQ will work proactively to anticipate
crises, monitoring developments in areas of interest to the UK.
''Its establishment will set in place a proper, clear, and unambiguous
connection between policy and the strategic direction and conduct of
operations.''
The headquarters would bring together on a permanent basis
intelligence, planning, operational and logistics staffs.
''Because it will exist on a permanent basis rather than being
established for a particular operation, as under current arrangements,
the permanent joint HQ will be involved from the very start of planning
for possible operations,'' Mr Rifkind said.
''Thereafter it will take responsibilty for the subsequent exectuion
of those plans if necessary.''
DEFENCE spending will drop by a fifth during the 1990s with the annual
budget falling to #22,320m by 1997-98. The figures show a huge cut from
around 4% of gross domestic product to just 2.8%.
At the same time the number of Servicemen and women will drop from
well over 300,000 in 1990 to just 231,500 by April next year -- 48,000
Royal Navy, 117,000 Army and 66,500 RAF.
However, attempts to cut the number of civilian staff have stumbled,
according to the White paper. Plans to cut civilian numbers from 137,272
on January 1, 1995, to 128,700 on April 1, 1996, have had to be delayed
by several months.

THE Government came under fire on a number of fronts yesterday over
its policies on exports and inward investment.
In both the Commons Chamber and the Scottish Select Committee, attacks
were launched by MPs on the way overseas investment policy is being
handled. The Government hit back, however, with the claim that the
Shadow Cabinet had no business experience and would destroy Britain's
export base if elected.
A Commons debate on exports, industry and inward investment provided
the opportunity for the Labour attack, in which Front Bench spokesman
Stuart Bell said the growth in exports was carried by a weak currency
and the Government only could keep goods competitive by constant
devaluations and higher-than- necessary interest rates.
For the Government, however, Trade Minister Richard Needham described
the Opposition as ''woefully out of touch,'' with the needs of exporters
and added: '' The more they whine, the more it costs.''
The Trade Minister said: ''The nationalised monopolies cost the
taxpayer #50m a week in 1979 and now they pay #50m in tax a week.''
Britain was the most successful country in Europe at attracting inward
investment.
During the debate, former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart said
he believed there was a consensus in the House about the objectives of
inward investment. The levels of investment being achieved were a ''very
considerable vote of confidence in the Government and its policies.''
Mr Malcolm Bruce, for the Liberal Democrats, blamed tax changes for
endangering Scotch whisky industry jobs and profitability and urged the
Government to give more support.
He praised the distillers of J&amp;B Whisky who, he said, sell 24 million
bottles a year to Spain.
''I always find it rather odd and ironic that an enormous amount of
effort goes into the subtlety of the blend of whisky . . . for it to be
drunk diluted with Coca-Cola. But I have to say that if they are buying
24 million bottles of it I don't care what they dilute it with.''
Elsewhere, the Scottish Select Committee was taking evidence as part
of its inquiry into the future of Scottish agriculture, and was told
that Scotland could do more to market, for example, Aberdeen Angus beef.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of the Argyll stores group, argued that
more breed-specific marketing could be put into the way beef was farmed
and marketed.

<HEADLINE>Clarke tries to shrug off 'panic' on tax</HEADLINE>

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke yesterday fought off accusations of panic
government over the U-turn on the homeowners' ''tax that never was''.
He brushed aside the ''wave of hysteria'' surrounding the Government
decision to abandon apparent plans to charge tax on pay-outs to the sick
and jobless under mortgage protection insurance.
The Prime Minister, visiting Northern Ireland, refused point-blank to
discuss the issue as Labour set about exploiting the ''yawning gulf''
between him and Mr Clarke.
Mr Major appeared to tell MPs on Tuesday that the tax had been under
review by the Chancellor for ''some months'' -- but Mr Clarke then
claimed he knew nothing of the proposals until that morning.
The Chancellor said yesterday that the decision not to levy the tax
came after consideration by Ministers of routine recommendations from
Inland Revenue officials.
''The origin of this tax that never was -- and was never likely to be
-- was that the officials took the view that on a strict view of the law
some of these benefits might be taxable,'' he said.
''The routine work of a giant department like the Treasury involves
Inland Revenue officials quite frequently giving rulings on tax
liablities.
''They refer the most important ones to their minister, Sir George
Young, and he occasionally will refer the most significant ones to me.
''He referred this one, and yesterday (Tuesday) morning it took us
five or 10 minutes to sort out a tax that had never been charged, a tax
that no minister had ever proposed and a tax that was never collected.''
However, Labour accused the Government of formally planning to levy
the tax and failing to produce any evidence to support its claim that a
review had been under way.
Labour leader Tony Blair said the confusion showed there was something
''deeply wrong'' at the heart of government.
''This Government has no direction at all. It is pushed around from
day to day without any coherent strategy at all,'' he told a Newspaper
Society lunch in London.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown used the final Labour news conference
of the local government election campaign south of the Border to demand
a full Commons statement.
In a further jibe at the Government, Mr Brown accused the Chancellor
of postponing his monthly meeting with the Governor of the Bank of
England until after the elections, to avoid a voters' backlash against
an expected interest rate rise.
The City expects the Chancellor and Bank Governor Eddie George to
agree tomorrow on an interest rate rise of 0.5%, affecting millions of
mortgages.
0 Voters are expected to deliver another blow to the Government today,
after last month's devastating results in Scotland where the
Conservatives were left without control of a single council.
Forecasts say they could lose more than 1000 seats and be left
controlling no councils in Wales and only a handful in England.
A drubbing on this scale would put Jeremy Hanley's future as Tory
Party chairman in peril and could prompt nervous Conservative MPs to
bring a leadership challenge to John Major.
Mr Hanley, who was accused of a string of gaffes since he became party
chairman last summer, yesterday declared himself happy to be judged by
his stewardship of the local elections campaign.

THE Government backed down on another issue yesterday -- the
Jobseekers' Bill -- after cross-party protests that it sought to take
too much power for Ministers and officials in defining unemployment.
Leader of the House Lord Cranborne agreed that a crucial clause should
be sent back for detailed committee stage scrutiny.
The clause deals with the definition of being ''available for
employment'' and ''actively seeking employment'' and provides rules
requiring jobseekers to attend interviews.
Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman said later: ''This is yet
another humiliation for the Government by the Lords. Every day the
Tories become more and more of shambles.''

SENIOR spokesmen from all four main political parties in Scotland were
involved in angry exchanges over the state of Scottish housing yesterday
as momentum built up for the Perth and Kinross by-election.
A Scottish Grand Committee debate at Westminster was dominated by a
series of clashes over the Scottish housing budget and how problems such
as dampness, condensation, and the building of new homes should be
addressed.
The debate was initiated by the SNP, whose vice-president, Mr Andrew
Welsh, MP for Angus East, put forward a six-point plan for tackling the
situation.
He wants a Minister for Housing, a restructuring of capital housing
debt to release money for new building, and the abolition of Scottish
Homes, which would be replaced by a new agency dedicated to providing
''good quality housing and a high- standard of public-sector
management.''
However, the SNP's plans were attacked by both Labour and the
Government. The Liberal Democrats weighed in with a criticism of the
Government over its policy on homelessness and its attitude towards new
build.
With tempers rising, Labour's Front Bench spokesman Mr John McAllion
attacked the SNP, claiming its plan to restructure housing debt had not
been properly thought through. It would lose the Exchequer about #510m a
year and put taxes up by 3.4p.
He urged the SNP -- and its candidate in Perth and Kinross -- to be
honest with the voters in the area about the consequences of its
policies, and said what was being put forward was ''total moonshine,
fantasy politics.''
With SNP leader Alex Salmond sniping in the background about what
Labour would do, Mr Welsh intervened to demand: ''When are you going to
start talking about Labour's housing policy? You have not said a word
about it so far.''
Mr McAllion retorted that Labour's policy was under review, and added:
''We are looking at the current state of housing policy to see what
Labour will inherit. We are looking very hard at what can be done and we
are not going around making promises that cannot be delivered.''
In the debate, Mr Welsh claimed thatsome mothers had to scrape mould
from their children's clothes, and added: ''86,000 Scottish children
live in damp housing. That cannot be acceptable in a country which
claims to be a civilised society.''
For the Government, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton said the SNP did not realise the implications of its
own policies, and he added: ''If implemented now, this would mean the
transfer of some #500m in loan charges in 1995-96 to the general
taxpayer, and much the same amount in succeeding years to service the
current capital debt of some #4bn.
''You (Mr Welsh) owe it to the House to explain where you believe the
#500m should be found. Which programmes would be reduced in order to
finance this measure, or would we have national taxation?''
For the Liberal Democrats, Scottish leader Jim Wallace attacked the
Government over the number of homeless people in Scotland, and said:
''Building, repairing and maintenance does create jobs. The costs of not
making adequate provision are costs in terms of health and social
welfare.''

A MOTHER who killed her son and buried his body in the garden kept the
secret in the family for 23 years, an inquest was told yesterday.
Mrs Joy Mayes killed her son, Roderick, because she feared he would
die a horrible death from his drug addiction, Coroner Paul Forrest
heard.
She buried him in the rear garden of her home at Weston-super-Mare,
Avon, with the help of her older son, Sean, and her father.
The body lay undiscovered until February this year when Mr Sean Mayes,
now dying from Aids, told police of the secret.
The inquest at Weston-super-Mare heard that the recovered body was
remarkably well preserved because it had been wrapped in a candlewick
bedspread and heavy plastic sheeting.
Mrs Mayes drugged Roderick's cocoa and, as he lay asleep, fractured
his skull with a heavy metal footscraper then cut his throat with a
kitchen knife.
The body was kept under her bed for some days before it was lowered
from a ground floor window to the garden for a night burial.
Dental and medical records were used to confirm that the body was that
of Roderick, 23, who died on April 8, 1972.
Pathologist Hugh White said he found skull fractures consistent with
heavy blows and a neck injury caused by a sharp object. Death was from
head injuries.
Detective Sergeant Mike Robinson, of Avon and Somerset Police, who
headed the inquiry, was the sole witness to give evidence in person
yesterday.
He said that Sean Mayes, who was attending St Mary's Hospital,
Paddington, London, was suffering from terminal Aids. ''He had disclosed
through counselling that his mother had killed his brother and that he
and his grandfather had assisted in the burial.''
His grandfather, Commander Thomas Thompson, OBE, died on April 8,
1975, and Mrs Mayes died on September 23, 1991.
The coroner said he was satisfied that Roderick Mayes was unlawfully
killed.
Mr Robinson said that Sean and Roderick Mayes were the only sons of
Mrs Mayes and Charles Mayes, who divorced in 1950. The boys stayed with
their mother and grandfather and moved to Weston.
Sean became a pop musician with a rock revival group, Fumble. On his
return from a tour in Switzerland he attended an aunt's funeral on April
12, 1972. ''Afterwards his mother told him she had killed Roderick days
earlier and that the body was still in the house.''
The detective said her story was that Roderick was heavily abusing
drugs, and a nurse told her he would die in an asylum if he carried on
that way.
''Rather than see him suffer the mother decided to end his life. She
gave him sleeping pills in his cocoa and when he fell asleep she hit him
over the head with a heavy metal scraper until she felt the skull give
way. That did not kill him and she took a knife from the kitchen and cut
his throat.''
After the burial the house was sold and the family moved to London.
Mr Robinson said that Sean Mayes was not expected to live beyond this
year.
After the hearing Mr Robinson said: ''It has been decided that no
proceedings will be taken against the only surviving person, Sean
Mayes.''
Roderick Mayes will now be able to have the proper funeral Sean
wanted. It is believed that is why he told police his story.

POLICE union officials in Strathclyde are in future to sit on the
force's internal firearms committee, after renewed pressure over the
level of armed back-up for ordinary officers making arrests.
It was confirmed yesterday, after a meeting between Police Federation
officials and the Deputy Chief Constable, Mr James Richardson, that a
review would be carried out of the armed response capability.
The federation wishes to see the tactical firearms unit beefed up, and
an increase on the two armed response vehicles available.
Mr Tom Rowatt, secretary of the Strathclyde branch of the union, said:
''We feel that there is insufficient armed back-up and there is concern
that one of these days things will not work out right.''

A FOOTBALLER was so incensed by a referee's decisions that he drove
his car on to the pitch towards the frightened official.
Robert Crooks had already run the length of the pitch to abuse the
referee, Mr Denis Cunningham and then, after being ushered to the
changing rooms, emerged with a broom handle shouting: ''I'm going to
kill him.''
He was then thrown out of the park but returned in his car and drove
on to the pitch at 30-50mph.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday, Crooks, 25, admitted a breach of
the peace in Union Park, Saughton Road North, Edinburgh, by shouting and
swearing and threatening violence to Mr Cunningham.
He also admitted possessing an offensive weapon -- a piece of wood --
and another breach of the peace by driving on to the pitch towards Mr
Cunningham and putting him in fear for his safety.
The court heard that Crooks, of Telford Drive, Edinburgh, was playing
in a Sunday match for Telford United against Carrick Hearts.
Depute fiscal Anne Keenan said that the game had been played in a
generally sporting spirit, apart from one or two incidents, until 15
minutes before the end when two players were sent off for challenging
each other to fight.
Crooks appeared to disagree with the ref's decision, said Mrs Keenan,
and ran the length of the pitch towards him shouting, ''you cheating
bastard'' and ''I'm going to kill you.''
A spectator, Mr Raymond Wallace, and some of the players grabbed him
and Mr Wallace took him off to the changing rooms.
Mr Wallace was worried that Crooks would try to get back on to the
pitch, so he stayed half-way between the game and the changing rooms
and, sure enough, Crooks came out five minutes later.
He was carrying a 4ft long broom handle and said: ''I'm going to kill
him.''
Mr Wallace managed to get Crooks out of the sports ground but he came
back in his blue car and drove on to the pitch.
Mrs Keenan said that he was heading towards the ref but, when Mr
Cunningham moved out of the way, he did not steer towards him.
Crooks got out of the car but was surrounded by players and then got
back in and drove off.
The matter was reported to the police and, when Crooks was interviewed
he told them the ref had been biased towards the other team.
Solicitor Liz Ross said that the football authorities had taken a very
dim view of Crooks's actions.
''I'm very glad to hear it,'' commented Sheriff Martin Mitchell, who
added that what Crooks had done amounted to serious public offences as
well.
Ms Ross said that Crooks, a catering assistant, had been banned for
life by the Scottish Amateur Football Assocation.
Sheriff Mitchell deferred sentence on Crooks until May 24 for
background reports.

SITE work for the Kingston Bridge began in May 1967. It opened to
traffic in June 1975. The cost was #9.3m. The design life was put at 120
years.
Strathclyde Regional Council, the roads authority responsible for its
maintenance, has estimated the costs of works on the bridge since 1975
at #11.59m.
The main bills have been for quay wall stabilisation at #4.025m; cope
and parapet replacement at #3.57m;, and professional fees for testing
and inspections of #1.8m.
Other bills have been for monitoring, #455,000; deck accesses,
#130,000; professional fees for approach structures testing and
inspections, #840,000; tie downs, #520,000; comb joint jacking, #50,000;
and traffic management, #200,000.
The estimated costs of works still to be carried out are #17m. Phase
one, involving bridge strengthening, is put at #10m, with the breakdown
as follows:
Under-strength deck, #800,000; inadequate end bearings, #1.3m;
concrete repairs, #1m; deck waterproofing, #1.1m; parapets, #1.6m;
traffic management, #500,000, and testing and professional fees,
#700,000.
That work includes the jacking operation to raise the 50,000-tonne
road deck by almost an inch; replacing the support piers; and moving the
centre section nearly three inches to put it back on its bearings.
Phase two, costing #7m, would further address strengthening, and also
involve work to the deck, end bearings, concrete repairs, deck
waterproofing, and parapets. No breakdown of costs is available.
According to Strathclyde's roads department, another #25.735m is
required for remedial works and strengthening of the north and south
approaches to the bridge along with its entry and exit ramps. If they
were replaced rather than improved, costs would soar to #53.695m.
Today's replacement cost is put at #30m. That figure soars to #86m
when the approaches are taken into account.
The consulting engineers and designers were W A Fairhurst and
Partners, and the contractor a joint venture between Logan and Marples
Ridgeway. Strathclyde Regional Council has intimated a claim for damages
against the bridge designers.

<HEADLINE>Report warns more radical solution may yet have to be found after strengthening work.  #10m to patch up Kingston Bridge</HEADLINE>

COUNCILLORS will be asked today to spend another #10m on patching up
the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow which is being driven into the ground
because the foundations are so weak.
They will also be warned that, even after replacing the present
support piers, a ''more radical solution'' may have to be found.
More than #11m has already been spent on repairs to the 25-year-old
structure, which now requires major strengthening works. There are fears
that both ends of the bridge could lift off their bearings if too many
lorries are concentrated on the centre section at the same time.
The latest #10m scheme, to replace the supports on each side of the
bridge, would guarantee a life span of 15 more years.
The request to approve the #10m contract comes from Strathclyde
Regional Council's roads director, Mr Donald Carruthers, in a report to
the roads and transportation committee. It declares the bridge has not
only moved sideways by a few inches but that the centre span has sagged
by about a foot. The bridge has also slipped on its bearings and is
pressing against the northern approach ramps.
The dossier by Mr Carruthers puts the estimated cost of a replacement
bridge at #30m, but recommends the six-point #10m plan which would take
until 1999 to complete.
Phase one -- costing #2m and due for completion by November next year
-- includes jacking up the bridge to take the weight of the original
supports while wider and enlarged piers are substituted to spread the
50,000 tonne load over a wider base.
Alleged defects to be addressed include strengthening of the deck,
pier shafts, and pile decks; correcting the leans on the north pier and
approaches; and repairing the slipped north pier bearings and
approaches.
The work is said to be so highly specialised that no one contractor
has the necessary skills or resources to carry it out. Three civil
engineering firms -- Balfour Beatty, Morrison Construction, and Norwest
Holsta -- have been placed on a short leet for negotiations.
The plan aims to keep Europe's busiest motorway bridge open to
traffic, except on a few weekends. It excludes #25m worth of work
required for the numerous on and off ramps which is unlikely to be
completed before 2005.
Massive monitoring of bridge movements would be carried out before,
during, and after the works to ensure that all stresses and strains are
within limits. Councillors will be asked to put the contract out to
tender although it is conceded that the works would stabilise rather
than rectify all problems.
Mr Carruthers will tell them today: ''Further strengthening and
remedial works will still be required.''
He will submit later a separate report, in private, updating the
committee on legal actions surrounding the bridge.
The council is seeking damages for alleged defects against the bridge
designers, consulting engineers W. A. Fairhurst and Partners, following
extensive remedial works to the structure.
Responsibility for maintaining the Kingston Bridge -- and for funding
the contract -- is expected to transfer to the Scottish Office on local
government reorganisation next April.
According to Mr Carruthers, the Scottish Office's roads directorate
has agreed with his proposals to resolve the bridge's problems. It had
also indicated that the new Glasgow City Council would be asked to
continue with the works.
In his report, Mr Carruthers said he will undertake a road options
study to take account of changing traffic patterns.
He added: ''This will enable the successor roads authority to make a
value for money judgment as to whether to continue with the
strengthening of Kingston Bridge and its associated approach spans and
access ramps, or whether a more radical road option solution should be
adopted to cater for the traffic requirements of the 21st century.''
Govan MP Ian Davidson said last night that he will seek assurances
that the latest repairs will not mean endless work for consultants or
the construction industry in general.
He also expressed concern that taxpayers may be meeting the bills for
alleged design or construction faults, and added that the Scottish
Office must provide additional funding if necessary.

THE Scottish Ambulance Service yesterday dismissed calls for a review
of paramedic policy following a study of 500 heart attacks in Edinburgh.
It found that ambulance technicians had the same success rate in
managing heart attacks using defibrilators as more highly-trained
paramedics. The overall survival rate of 15% was achieved by both
groups.
Doctors at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary's accident and emergency
department carried out the study between 1992 and 1994. It calls into
question Government plans to have one paramedic in every front-line
ambulance by 1997.
The authors say this policy is not based on objective evidence, and is
not justified by their findings.
However, ambulance service medical director Dr Andrew Marsden rejected
this view. He said paramedics carried out a much wider range of
functions than attending cardiac arrests and further skills had been
added sinced the study.
''It would be surprising if paramedics and technicians got different
results. What the study clearly demonstrates is the value in having
defibrilators in front-line ambulances'' he said.
''These have now directly saved 1000 lives since their introduction
five years ago. Before we had defibrilators, people just died. It was
almost a universal fact, unless they were very close to a hospital.''
Dr Marsden said the overall survival rate of 10% from a heart attack
outside hospital would be greatly improved by the intervention of
bystanders trained in giving resuscitation, and earlier 999 calls when
an attack was imminent.
''It is very important that, if patients show signs like chest pains
and breathlessness, someone dials 999 for an ambulance without delay''
he added.
The authors of the study said their findings did not downgrade or
diminish the professional skills of paramedics.

LOTHIAN Regional Council completed a hat trick of top jobs on the new
City of Edinburgh Council yesterday with the announcement that the
authority's new chief executive is to be Mr Tom Aitchison, who holds the
same post at the region.
Regional convener Councillor Eric Milligan has already been confirmed
as the chairman of the new council which takes over next April, and
regional Labour group leader Councillor Keith Geddes is the leader of
the new city administration.
Mr Aitchison has won the #93,000 a year job against competition which
included the present Edinburgh District Council chief executive, Mr Bill
Blyth.
The appointment of Mr Aitchison, 44, however, will not generate the
kind of region v district row which greeted the news that Strathclyde
Region's deputy chief executive John Anderson had won the top job on the
new City of Glasgow Council.
In Mr Aitchison's case the recruitment sub-committee, containing both
region and district leaders, which met yesterday, agreed to recommend
his appointment unanimously. Its decision can expect to be confirmed at
a full meeting of the shadow authority later today.
Last night Mr Blyth gave his congratulations and full support to his
rival, and said he would be a worthy chief executive for the new
authority.
Mr Aitchison became chief executive of Lothian Regional Council in
1994 and had previously been deputy chief executive from 1991.
Councillor Geddes, who chaired the recruitment sub-committee, said he
would bring to his new post a proven track record in local government, a
good relationship with councillors, staff and with the wider Edinburgh
community.
He was sure Mr Aitchison's skills and qualities would be of
considerable benefit to the city in the years to come.

THE TWO main roads which feed Oban with its lifeblood tourist traffic
are set to be downgraded.
The news of the planned de-trunking of the Oban to Fort William and
Oban to Lochgilphead roads has led to a storm of protest.
Locals fear the long-awaited Creagan Bridge project, which it was
hoped would shorten the journey time between Oban and Fort William, is
now in jeopardy.
There is also concern that the new Argyll and Bute Unitary authority,
will not be able to afford the level of maintenance which Connel Bridge,
on the outskirts of Oban, requires.
Strathclyde Regional Councillor Campbell Cameron has written to the
Scottish Office expressing concern.
He said: ''The bottom line is yes, Creagan Bridge and the maintenance
of Connel Bridge are in jeopardy.''
Oban's tourist board chairman, Mr Allan McKie, is asking local Liberal
Democrat MP Ray Michie to fight the proposals all the way.

RESIDENTS who held a protest picnic over proposals for a #4m road into
the centre of Stirling have won a rethink from road planners.
Central Regional Council's policy committee agreed yesterday to look
again at plans for the eastern distributor road.
Officials had proposed making an early start on part of the road to
secure Scottish Office funding.
Mr Tom McCormack, director of technical services, recommended
immediate approval for a section of the road from Forthbank stadium to
Forthside industrial area.
He said the details of the more contentious western section, including
the road's entry into the town centre, could be resolved later.
But Mr Rob Ball, a senior Labour councillor, persuaded colleagues that
officials should be given weeks to come up with fuller proposals.

OVER five years ago, the Berlin Wall came down and people on both
sides of the Iron Curtain rejoiced at the prospect of a safer world.
Five years on, those hopes have been dashed by the spread of regional
and intra-state conflicts across the globe.
The human cost of these conflicts has been immense. War has raged
again in Europe, with 200,000 losing their lives in Bosnia and an
estimated 20,000 women being subjected to rape as a weapon of war. In
Africa, the tragedy of Somalia has been eclipsed by the horror of
Rwanda, with up to one million men, women, and children butchered in an
orchestrated campaign of genocide. World-wide, there are more than 40
million refugees.
But the reality in 1938 and the reality today is that we ignore such
conflicts at our peril. We are part of an increasingly inter-dependent
world where wars in one continent can have enormous consequences for
another.
The reluctance of the major powers to take early action to prevent and
respond to conflict stems from two inter-related factors -- first, a
belief that conflict in a far-flung corner of the globe has no direct
impact on their own national interests, and secondly, that the cost of
preventing or resolving these conflicts will be too high.
Both of these points are exaggerated. And we all share a clear moral
duty to intervene to protect human life.
At the end of the Second World War, when the full horrors of the
Holocaust were revealed, the nations of the world passed the 1948
Genocide Convention, saying that they would never again stand idly by
while genocide took place.
But that is exactly what they did in April and May last year while
thousands of innocent people were slaughtered in Rwanda. That is exactly
what they did again last week when thousands of Hutu men, women, and
children were massacred by Tutsi troops in a refugee camp in Kibeho,
south-west Rwanda.
As Burke said, ''it is necessary for good men to do nothing for evil
to triumph''. By failing to act, the international community allowed
evil to triumph in Rwanda, and it is an evil in which we are all
implicated as members of the international community.
But there are also practical reasons of national self-interest which
make timely intervention essential. When the true cost of conflict is
analysed, in economic terms as well as in human terms, it is quite
obvious that it is the industrialised nations of the world which foot
the bill.
For instance, in the former Yugoslavia, the EU spent over #61m in
humanitarian aid and provided #214m in support of UNPROFOR during 1993
alone. EU countries have had to deal with up to 500,000 refugees (at a
cost to the German government, for example, of #1200m per year).
Conflicts even farther from home also have a direct impact on the
major powers. For example, the conflict in Sudan cost US companies over
$1000m in lost investments, while Mozambique has cost the major donors
$6000m.
Of course it has become fashionable to talk about ''preventative
diplomacy'' and ''early warning systems'', but what use are they if they
are not translated into collective political action? Early warning
without early action will simply serve to make us better informed about
how many dead bodies we are likely to see.
As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, the
time has come for the international community to undertake a thorough
review of its response to conflict.
To achieve this, it will be necessary to establish an Office for
Preventative Diplomacy under the control of the Secretary-General, with
the UN Security Council agreeing to consider all recommendations for
action from that Office.
The UN must also improve its stand-by arrangements as a first step
towards establishing a rapid deployment force available for immediate
direction to trouble spots. And the international community should take
a long hard look at the arms trade.
The cost of strengthening the UN is small compared with world military
expenditure. Each year the international community spends 250 times more
on arms, which fuel conflicts, than on peacekeeping. It is a scandal
that over 90% of all arms sold to Third World countries are sold by the
permanent five members of the Security Council. What hypocrisy!
It is about time these rich nations realised that the consequences of
this trade are not exclusively felt in the developing world. It is
ironic, for instance, that the cost to the US of Operation Restore Hope
in Somalia -- one aspect of which involved gathering up US manufactured
weapons which had previously been sold to the Siad Barre regime --
roughly equalled the value of all of the weapons sold. It is also a sad
fact that during the Gulf War, Allied troops found themselves facing
weapons supplied by their own side.
The international community should take urgent steps to curb the arms
trade by implementing common guidelines. The UN Register of Arms should
be extended to include small arms, so that the trade in this most widely
used category of arms will fall under the glare of the international
spotlight, a prerequisite for control.
Finally, as we speak about conflict prevention and conflict
resolution, we must not forget to examine the underlying causes of those
conflicts. Let us not forget that Rwanda is one of the poorest countries
and also one of the most heavily populated on the African continent, in
addition to suffering from an enormous international debt burden and a
shattered economy. All of these were contributory factors. And they were
factors to which we, in the industrialised North, contributed.
Instead of the Overseas Development Administration planning to cut
bilaterial aid to Africa by #60m over the next three years, the funding
should be maintained or, ideally, increased. The impoverishment and
deprivation rife in the majority of countries in Africa is a primary
source of conflict.
If we continue to live in a world where the rich nations grow richer
and the poor nations grow poorer, we can expect to live in a world where
conflict increases, making all of us poorer in the end.

MR George Foulkes is creating a brouhaha in his MP's bailiwick of
Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley anent low-flying aircraft of the RAF
on training missions in the proximity of Prestwick Airport (April 24)
that tells one that he and folk like him need reminding that 50 years
ago and more the countryside of the Low Countries and the bottom of the
Zuider Zee were littered with the remains of Allied aircraft -- mainly
British Mosquitoes, Beaufighters, Blenheims and suchlike -- that, in
attempting to underfly German radar and air defences on their missions,
fell victim to enemy ground fire and air defences.
That the price of peace in the past has been eternal vigilance can
scarce be doubted but it is a price fewer and fewer folk are willing to
pay, hopeful that by selling peace short that there will be no
unpleasant consequences.
The message coming from the lieges, some of them, is that it is best
to leave tomorrow to take care of itself and to abandon training for our
Service personnel that is meaningful and realistic to them, even if it
is inconvenient, a nuisance even, to those going about their lawful
occasions.
In such an environment commercial and private aviation, likewise
fishing and farming, can continue to live, move, and have their being
profitably and peacefully without any unpleasant reminders of the
failure to keep up payments and the consequences.
Like many I have my scars to remind me of the last time the price of
peace was sold short and hopefully I will not be around when the
chickens of George Foulkes and his fellow life-of-peace travellers come
home to roost, and the bill, in the form of an ultimatum as of yore, is
presented.
History has a nasty habit of repeating itself -- again and again.
The pass has already been sold and, like the Irish and the Spanish in
the Second World War, who averted their eyes from what was happening to
some people within the Third Reich, Mr Foulkes and his friends will have
to avert their eyes from anything done in their name come the next
conflagration.
With negligible influence and no real power in the European Union,
already upon us, what can once ''Great'' Britain do when something like
conditions that obtained at the height of Adolf Hitler's ritual
cleansing comes to the fore again? Why should it not?

JOHN MACLEOD is wrong to dismiss Hitler's Austrian origins as they
provide the key to the question he himself is unable to answer, Why did
Hitler hate the Jews? (Hitler's legacy, April 29).
When Hitler was subsisting as a failed artist in the slums of Vienna
before the First World War he became immersed in the creed of
anti-Semitism which had its roots deep in Eastern Europe, the same creed
that had forced Jews from the East into the then safe refuge of Germany.
The idea that ''my life is a failure, it must be someone else's
fault'' appealed to this failure as it does to many petty nationalists.
He was 24 when he moved to Germany, taking his anti-semitism with him.
Only after 15 years of selling his quick fix of ''blame everything on
the Jews'' did he con the demoralised Germans into giving him power. He
could then turn his attention back to his native country and take
control within days in 1938.
It is indeed ironical that Austria's greatest achievement has been to
persuade the world that Hitler was German and that Beethoven was
Austrian.

CARDINAL WINNING is quoted as having said that Mr Ian Lang, MP, is a
person he ''can do business with'' (May 2).
So said Mrs Thatcher of Mr Gorbachev.
Is the Cardinal sending a message to the people of Scotland, Catholic
or otherwise, that he is giving public endorsement of the policies
adopted by a Government whose support in Scotland is virtually
non-existent?
If that is not his intention in the statement attributed to him, would
he care to specify in which areas of public governmental policy he can
''do business'' with this Government?
The voting population of Scotland will, I am sure, await with interest
further clarification of the reasons for this meeting between him, Mr
Lang, and Lord Fraser, and the Cardinal's reactions to it.
If, as is being claimed by Ian Lang, this was a private meeting, then
why was it publicised in advance and followed by what appears to be an
arranged photocall with the Cardinal and Mr Lang as the central figures?
It would be interesting to know what aspects of the Government's
social policy were discussed in the reported two-and-a-half-hour
session.
Is the Cardinal convinced that Mr Lang is the man to solve the social
issues which plague this nation? If he is so convinced, the Cardinal
could perhaps expand upon the conclusion he has apparently drawn from
this meeting.

MR MOCHRIE'S simile of himself and the camel does not fully explain
his umbrage (April 27). Anger, like beauty, is often in the eye of the
beholder and one is left with the impression that chronologically his
hump came before the straw.
Odd how those who would corner the market of ''sweet reasonableness
and humanity'' can be so ready to stop the mouths and break the pens of
those who gainsay them.
Contrary to his assertions it is not the traditionalists who stand
(like a dog with a bone) over ''their interpretation and meaning of
scripture''. They are in the happy position of defending the mass of
Christian belief down through the centuries. They are defending a
cataract of faith incorporated in the Apostles Creed, not their own
ideas.
No. It is for the isolated and self-opinionated ''expert'' to
manufacture and expound the exotic notions, not the common herd.
With regard to the universities' ''treating theology as less than
astrology and scripture as a literary curiosity or cultural
archaeology,'' his wish may well come to pass but only for a time and
only in an age of darkness.
And when the light returns and ''sweet reasonableness and humanity''
re-assert themselves, there will be the Church in the midst of them.
That, leastwise, has been history's lesson.

THE comments of Lord Young quoted by you (Herald Business, April 27)
in defence of outrageously high salary increases and stock options on
top of already high salaries remind me of Mandy Rice-Davies's famous
comment. ''He would say that, wouldn't he?''
To pontificate that in benefiting their own and their family's lives
society also benefits must ring hollow in the ears of the soon to be
ex-employees of Rolls-Royce and the British Gas employees who have seen
their salaries adjusted downwards.
Lord Young's bout of self-justification ignores a number of points.
Many of the fat cats have awarded themselves extraordinarily high
increases at the expense of their personnel.
Cedric Brown justifies his greed by stating that executives in his
position in countries such as America are even better paid, but he
justifies cutting the salaries of his staff by stating that he is simply
bringing their salaries into line with comparable positions in other
industries here in the UK.
Comparisons like this are odious and irrelevant. Why doesn't Mr Brown
compare his level of remuneration with a counterpart in Argentina or
Portugal which, one assumes, pays substantially less than the UK?
What Lord Young also ignores is that the real anger currently being
expressed is against those who have benefited simply by being put in
charge of newly privatised industries sold off at a song by the
Government and not so much against those who have established industries
which are competitive and beneficial to the UK in their own right.
Lord Young is, of course right when he states that enterprise is not
greed. Enterprise is the spirit and imagination of the individual put to
a use which benefits all. Greed is a few tawdry and obscene people whose
aim is to generate ever more wealth for themselves at the expense of
others.

THE comments by Mr Pritchard and Mr Inglis on professional fees for
conveyancing sound like jobs for the boys (April 14 and 18). To suggest
that solicitors need to charge as much as many skilled people get paid
per day as they charge per hour otherwise they may go bankrupt cannot be
taken seriously.
Conveyancing of the majority of houses is a simple matter and of
course solicitors are not liking competition for this most lucrative of
their activities.
Should something go wrong after purchasing a house, readers are more
likely to find it near impossible to get anyone to accept
responsibility, ending up with years of litigation as in the case you
recently highlighted.
The Law Society may, after you have grown a lot older and run out of
letter paper, issue a Letter of Regret to their solicitor. Other
professional bodies and their insurers adopt the same protective
procedure.
If readers were asked to send in documented cases of conveyancing gone
wrong, the Royal Mail would do well. Cases of professions under
self-regulation readily accepting mistakes are very rare.
A quick and cheap independent referral system is urgently needed which
could dispose of disputes. And there is no reason why a most competent
conveyance cannot be completed for much less than usually charged.

Your report (Culture of dependency holds sway, May 1) correctly
highlighted the deepening problems of deprivation and poverty in
Strathclyde, in spite of the various policies pursued by the regional
council and others.
Whilst their policies may appear to have had little impact to reduce
the overall level of deprivation, it is frightening to think about how
much more poverty there would have been without them.
These problems of poverty, unemployment, homelessness, etc, will next
year be inherited by new local authorities which will have powers with
regard to social and economic development. To these authorities will be
entrusted the resources with which to continue the battle against the
alienation of large parts of our society.
It is vital that the new unitary councils learn from the policies and
experience of Strathclyde Regional Council and implement cohesive social
and economic development plans which encourage people to play an active
party in improving their living standards and support them in the
process of so doing.

GEORGE M WATSON was only partly correct when he stated that #1 given
to a charity is #1 when they receive it (May 2).
Unlike the National Lottery which takes 12% in tax and 14% in
administration -- #5m before the Charities Board issues a penny -- the
Government via covenants gives 33p free of charge to charities.
I have been outspoken in my opposition to the National Lottery and its
regressive taxation and have raised my funding of voluntary

I HAVE seldom read such a package of mealy-mouthed management jargon
as that penned by Bernard Connolly, Glasgow's director of parks and
recreation, on the topic of Scotstoun Leisure Centre and Whiteinch
Swimming Club (April 29).
If he is truly trying to respond to the needs of the club, as he
claims, why did he repeatedly ignore phone calls from our local
councillor, Jean McFadden, attempting to raise the club's needs with
him? Why did it take him from early March until early April to respond
at all?
Why did his department refuse to invite youngsters from the local
swimming club to the opening, but invited other youngsters to swim at
the opening? Pettiness or just incompetence?
Despite his excuses the fact remains that the club, which used to have
four hours per week to train youngsters in the old Whiteinch Baths --
presumably the department was able to balance these hours within the
context of its objectives -- has only been offered one hour per week in
Whiteinch's replacement facility, the Scotstoun Leisure Centre.
That hour finishes too late at 9pm for children of five and six years
old to make their way home.
Councillor Jean McFadden has been quite right to take a stand in
support of this well-loved local club which is, in fact, having
facilities removed from it by the opening of this community leisure
facility.
The local Labour Party, the local councillor, and the local community,
which welcomed and supported the building and opening of Scotstoun
Leisure Centre, deplore the unhelpful and dismissive attitude of the
director of parks and recreation.
We argued for a centre that would provide much-needed facilities for
the young people of the area. We will not be fobbed off with excuses
that cover an attempt to create a facility for the elite.

THE tranquillity of a Sunday afternoon in my home village of Harthill
was disturbed by sectarian parade. Along the main street the
participants marched, flags flying, accompanied by a band and escorted
by police.
Did this sectarian parade intimidate anyone? Did it incite hatred, as
has been widely reported in various newspapers sectarian parades do?
No, of course it didn't. Why? Because it was a parade of the Girls'
Brigade, from various Churches of Scotland within the Presbytery of West
Lothian, parading to St Andrews Church of Scotland for their annual
re-dedication ceremony.
This parade, being most certainly sectarian in nature, would come
under the description of ''intolerant bigots'', attributed to PC Norman
Macleod in the article by Raymond Duncan (April 28). It would also be
''precluded from using the road for such a purpose'', were his proposed
amendment to the legislation enacted.

ANOTHER blow is expected to be dealt to the elusive feel-good factor
tomorrow if interest rates rise for the fourth time since last
September. Mortgages, spared from the last increase in rates, are hardly
likely to escape a second time. Ever since it became known last month
that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor
of the Bank of England, Eddie George, were to meet the day after the
local government elections in England and Wales, the presumption has
been that base rates would be increased by half a point to 7.25%.
Britain began raising rates at a relatively early stage in the economic
cycle to check the build-up of inflationary pressures from robust
growth. The policy is designed to keep inflation within the Government's
1% to 4% target range and to achieve a rate of 2.5% or less by the end
of the current Parliament -- in early 1997 if it runs its full course.
The objective is a sustained period of steady economic growth without
the boom and bust excesses of the eighties and earlier decades. The hope
is that such a policy will result in interest rates peaking in single
figures.
For much of last year the economy was growing at more than 4% per
annum, well above its long-term trend rate of around 2.25%. In the past
six months the pace has slowed down a little, but growth is still in
excess of 3%. Expectations that growth would fall further in the first
quarter of this year have not been realised, leaving Clarke and George
with little option but to raise rates. In any event they were under
pressure to do so because of sterling's weakness. The pound's
international value has fallen by around 4.5% since the start of the
year. Import prices are already rising as a result, and exporters will
receive a boost, especially in their trade with the hard currency
countries on the Continent. Both effects will exacerbate inflationary
pressures. The Governor and the Chancellor were both concerned about
sterling's decline as long ago as their meeting in March. Since then the
pound has fallen further. A decision to make no change in rates tomorrow
would wrong-foot the financial markets and leave the pound in an exposed
position, especially over the VE-Day bank holiday weekend. Most other
major financial centres reopen for business as normal on Monday.
The Government has created an economic recovery in which most people
have not shared. The manufacturing sector has been the major
beneficiary. Retailers have had a much harder time, with hefty price
cuts often needed to boost trade. The housing market is in the doldrums
and will be disadvantaged further by the expected rise in rates.
Ironically there is a great deal of merit in seeking to switch resources
from personal consumption to exports and investment. The consumer ruled
the roost in the Thatcher years, but imports were sucked in as the
manufacturing sector declined. The boot is now on the other foot, but
the Conservative Party may well pay a heavy electoral price for raising
unrealistic expectations in the eighties, and then being forced to
frustrate them in the nineties. Indeed it is already doing so, as
today's voting south of the Border will demonstrate just as surely as
last month's local elections in Scotland.
The CBI's director-general, Howard Davies, sought yesterday to play
down fears that a half-point rise in rates would damage consumer
confidence. Davies is due to move to the Bank of England later this year
as George's deputy and is doubtless brushing up his monetary credentials
meantime. As the CBI's top official he is well aware of the inflationary
pressures building up in the economy, notably in the manufacturing
sector. For all its lack of direction elsewhere, the Government has
shown commendable courage in making the battle against inflation its top
priority and in seeking to restore order to the public finances after
the ravages of recession. But voters, rightly suspicious of such
long-term tenants of Whitehall, are enraged because they are the ones
who are paying the price -- through higher taxes and interest rates. The
Conservative Party faces an almost impossible task if it is to persuade
the country to take a different view.

MOST actors in their maturity cherish hopes of playing King Lear. Sir
Michael Hordern fulfilled that ambition -- the role was one of his
outstanding successes in a long career. But probably more people will
remember him as the voice of Paddington Bear than as Shakespeare's
tragic hero ''bound upon a wheel of fire'', the ''very foolish fond old
man'' who handed over his kingdom and his happiness to a brace of
pelican daughters. Sir Michael was one of the last representatives of
stage acting in the grand classical tradition, but he was also one of
the first to lend his skills wholeheartedly to the younger media. He was
frequently seen on television and he appeared in 60 films.
Was he the last of a line? In retrospect it seems as if an era
typified by such great actors as Sir Ralph Richardson and Lord Olivier
has come to an end (actresses never achieved quite the same iconic
status, chiefly because our greatest playwrights have traditionally
given the best roles to men). Gielgud, the plummiest of all, may be seen
as the last representative of a threatened species. The finest actors of
today are rather a different breed. Their style is often less histrionic
than was customary in past generations, more in tune with the current
dramatic mode which is determined by the close-scanning eye of cinema
and television, and better adapted to the plainer demands of
contemporary dramatic writing, whether for stage or screen. Superbly
talented actors like Michael Gambon and Brian Cox are the inheritors of
this new style. Sir Michael helped to bridge the gap.
Today, when drama comes into our homes via the television screen, the
stage on which Sir Michael learned his craft may seem to many viewers to
be old hat and out of date. At the same time it would be premature to
write it off as obsolescent. True, live theatre struggles to survive
against rival attractions. Most of our theatres are subsidised with
public money. Those that are not must depend on the goodwill of sponsors
and the fickle whim of audiences. For them, as the current crisis at the
Edinburgh Festival Theatre demonstrates, the threat of disaster is
always waiting in the wings. The theatre is a tougher world than when
Sir Michael first trod the boards. But it is still the focus of some of
our most exciting dramatic writing, still a stimulus for many of the
finest actors of today, and still the best training ground for the
actors of tomorrow -- Sir Michael's heirs.

As industrial unrest grips the Post Office, Margaret Vaughan addresses
the issue of union power and shop-floor frustrations.
PERHAPS it depends which side of Mrs Goggins' fence you're sitting on.
Is Postman Pat a shrieking militant, a throwback to the terrors of the
wild-eyed, loud-mouth-flecked-with-spittle past of shopfloor warriors,
which Thatcher's Children believed had been buried under an avalanche of
anti-union laws?
Or is he just fed up? Had it up to here? Blown the final gasket? A
decent man pushed beyond endurance into the dusty environs of an irate
mass meeting?
Whatever, he is not alone. Over the past year or so a new class of
union activist has emerged. Polite, formerly meek, well-groomed and
very, very cross.
Nurses, midwives, skilled Rolls-Royce engineers, nuclear-power workers
for goodness sake. Hardly the inheritors of Red Robbo's disquisitions on
screwing the bosses, are they? A fool can indeed ask questions that the
wise man cannot answer. Such as why now?
After 16 years of legislation which has eroded union power, when the
Government is close to completing the task of stripping the power of a
group it regards as comprising of coercive labour-monopolies protected
by legal immunities, which it began by prising the gnarled and blackened
fingers of the miners off the helm of industrial militancy?
When employers thought that trade unionism was dead after Wapping and
the demise of the closed shop, and brought in Human Resource Managers
instead of the bolshie shop steward? When the Government doesn't bother
to talk to them because if they are not a threat they are not worth
pacifying?
Trade unions are hardly in the pink and limbering up for a valiant
struggle on behalf of their shrinking membership, are they? Going
through their worst financial crisis in 60 years, locked in what many
see as a struggle for survival, income in freefall, membership dropping
like a millstone, scepticism among employees over the benefits of
joining: and the young preferring to do violence with visored police
officers over roads, finding solidarity with crated veal instead of on
the picket line.
To say nothing of the changing labour market; flexible, part-time,
insecure and unsecured. Yes, the shift in industrial power balance away
from labour to capital looked, to many, to be complete, reinforced by
global competitive pressures, technological innovation and the growth of
new employment patterns such as part-time work.
Indeed there were those on both sides of the divide who argued that
the last big battle in Western countries, between employers and what
remains of organised labour, was already over bar the shouting on
denuded May Day marches.
So as awkward questions arise about the point of trade union activity
in a climate where the law, government, many employers and even trade
union members oppose it, what happens? The postal workers vote to
strike. And vote to stay out. And even, in militant throwback mode,
throw beer mats and twopenny pieces at the union official who tells them
to go back to work?
Is this a resurgence of union militancy? A new enthusiasm for direct
action? A polite counter-revolution to confound those who believed union
muscle had wasted away?
Up to a point, says Dr Cliff Lockyer, a specialist in industrial
relations who inhabits an office in Strathclyde University's department
of Human Resource Management. Like a good academic he weighs up whether
there is any such renaissance of industrial unrest:
''On one hand you could say there are very many reasons why we not
expect an upsurge in trade union militancy or industrial unrest. The
Government would claim it has successfully reformed industrial
relations, limited scope for strikes and union action.
''Trade union membership continues to fall and there's a constant
decline in the percentage of the workforce who are members of a trade
union. Then there are considerable changes in management practice and
employment policies which tend to stress a lesser role for unions.
''There are changing patterns of recruitment, more people in flexible
part-time employment, and relatively high levels of unemployment. So,
yes, there are many reasons why we wouldn't expect industrial unrest. On
the other hand . . .''
Dr Lockyer enumerates the growing number of ''local'' strikes in the
past year, the growth of sporadic shop-floor stoppages. He points out
these have tended to be mostly in traditional industries where
management is intent on the swift introduction of new work practices.
Bubbling frustrations may nowadays stop short of action involving
walkouts: it can result in unrest manifesting itself in loss of
co-operation, lack of willingness, increasing discontent.
''As Government has taken more out of the economy through tax, there
will be growing pressure for wage improvements to compensate for
declining living standards.
''In some sectors, where they are still trying to force change
through, there might well be an upsurge of work problems but we are not
likely to see a resurgence of industrial unrest along the lines of the
seventies,'' he argues. ''What we might see however is a growth of more
alternative to traditional strike action -- increasing non-co-operation,
poor quality work, lack of motivation.''
He points out that over the past 15 years the Government has created
conditions to dramatically reduce employees' power to take industrial
action: ''That doesn't mean it solves the probems of industrial unrest
or work problems. It stops strikes but not the problems that can cause
them.''
For those employers who have taken the trouble to spend time improving
industrial relations the reaction to the changes has been good. But in
sectors such as the Post Office, he argues, where they are trying to
make rapid changes which most people would think twice about calling an
improvement, they have not carried their workforces forward with them.
''The trade union reforms may have reduced instances of illegal
strikes. What you might find is collective action stopping short of
that, protest demonstrations, organised non-co-operation. Or
alternatively people respond invidivually.'' By which, it seems, he
means the kind of action taken by disgruntled bakery operatives in
industrial lore of spitting in the mincer.
''In Britain we have concentrated on reducing strikes. There has been
no legislation to encourage harmony and co-operation at work.''
Bob Thomson, Scottish Secretary of the GMB, detects an industrial mood
change which he cannot, quite, put his finger on: ''I wonder if the
postal workers are an example of it. As far as requests for ballots are
concerned, industrial ballots under the legislation, over the past six
to nine months we've seen an increase in applications.''
The pressure is not just on employees. It's shared by employers, too:
''The employers are under tremendous pressure not to increase their
prices. It means that in the retail sector, in the textile and whisky
industry, if you can't put up the price you cut your unit costs and one
of those is labour costs.
''I think there is a feeling, and I can't be specific, that there is
growing unrest among trade union members. Maybe it's the sleaze factor.
They see fatcat bosses taking the big rises while they're forced to cut
back and it feels unfair. You can only push people so far . . . and I
wonder if that point has been reached.''
So is the climate undergoing a sea change with a new wave of
industrial unrest on the way?
The STUC's general secretary, Campbell Christie, is not convinced
there is any major shift in opinion among union members. They're just
fed up:''I certainly don't foresee any return to the militancy of the
seventies. I do think there's a moment when feelings boil over. It is
that we're seeing rather than any resurgence of widespread industrial
action.''
Tony Blair must be praying not. He has already warned the union chiefs
not to look for much change out of a tight purse. No special deals, no
favours.
But some received opinion which has it that waves of industrial unrest
are bad for the image of New Labour, is outmoded says Professor David
Marsh of Strathclyde's department of politics.
He argues that Labour has been out of power too long for public
opinion to lay the blame on it for trade union militancy. Blair's
see-me-I'm-tough stance against the sabre-rattling of trade union
leaders has probably also built up the image that he can stand fast
against any threat of widespread union militancy:
''In periods of big confrontation, like the miners' strike or in the
confrontations leading up to the '79 election, obviously attitudes
towards unions became negative. That was related to a decline in support
for the Labour Party.
''I think the recent round of industrial action is on a much more
limited scale and won't have much affect on public opinion in a way that
would affect voting.
''To the extent that Blair has stood up and been seen to change the
balance of voting within the Labour party in reducing the proportion of
union support, that has been effective in distancing the party from the
trade unions.
''Trade unions holding a Labour Government to ransom doesn't have much
resonance now. It's not an issue that will affect voting.''
More influential, he says, is the public perception of competence in
handling the eceonomy: ''You have a period now when the Government seems
to be demonstrating its incompetence rather than competence. There would
have to be a major confrontation which would allow the Government to be
seen to be standing up to the unions before you would see any influence
on voting patterns.''
Such a major confrontation would allow the Government some mileage in
being seen as strong and decisive: ''That kind of confrontation does not
seem likely at the moment, in the current economic climate.''

The Duke of Atholl excites ire by charging a toll for a private road.
Kirsty Scott looks at the aristocrat behind the uncommon impost.
WITH a family motto of Furth, Fortune and Fill the Fetters there was
never going to be anything ordinary about the Dukes of Atholl, and the
10th of that ilk, George Iain Murray, is no exception.
The recent headlines over the apparent introduction of a #5 toll for
use of a road on his Perthshire estate are just the latest from a sheaf
of stories which have characterised the Duke as controversial.
He is one of Scotland's wealthiest men and one of Britain's biggest
landowners and hackles have been raised when it has emerged that public
money may be handed out for work on his 148,000-acre estate or access
across it possibly restricted.
Earlier this week it emerged that a group of workers on an Adult
Training Scheme were to be provided at the taxpayers' expense to work on
the restoration of an eighteenth-century garden at Blair Castle; in 1993
he was criticised for applying for #300,000 in public grants to restore
the castle gardens; and earlier this year there was an almighty row with
Tayside Regional Council over an application for #400,000 of forestry
grants to plant mixed woodland on a portion of the estate. Council
leader Ewan Dow called for the introduction of a means test to stop
wealthy landowners qualifying for such assistance.
The Duke has also been pitted against the access lobby on a number of
occasions, most notably in 1992 when he challenged the status of the
historic Minigaig Pass as a right of way. The pass, which runs 26 miles
from Calvine to Kingussie, was an ancient mountain drove road.
At the time the Duke suggested that the pass might have been a right
of way in the sixteenth century but had probably been superseded by the
Drumochter Pass. He had proposed that access should be given when there
was no conflict with farming, forestry or deer control. Last year he
clashed again with ramblers and hillwalkers when he claimed that the
Letterewe Accord on access would not work on his land.
George Iain Murray was born on June 19, 1931, and knew from about the
age of 10 that he was likely to become a duke when his third cousin
three times removed died. His own father, Lieutenant Colonel George
Anthony Murray was killed in action in Italy in 1945.
When he succeeded to the title of Duke of Atholl in 1957 some
newspapers painted the event as a rags-to-riches tale with one carrying
the somewhat misleading headline: ''Assistant Works Manager on
#20-a-week Succeeds to Ducal Titles''.
He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, and carved out a
career as a businessman, holding the posiiton of chairman of the
Westminster Press group from 1974 to 1993, as well as being a director
of Pearson Longman between 1975 and 1983.
His other hats have included deputy chairman of the RNLI, president of
the Scottish Landowners Federation, member of the Red Deer Commission,
and he is currently president of the National Trust for Scotland.
Work aside, he is a keen bridge enthusiast and has chaired the House
of Lords team. Golf, shooting and stalking are also listed as passions
but he has said he stops short of fishing because he doesn't have the
temperament.
He is known as ''Wee Iain'' because of his height -- put between 6ft
4in and 6ft 5in -- and has never married, despite the best intentions of
the famous brothel-keeper Lindi St Clair, who wrote to him in 1992
offering herself for marriage and motherhood.
Ms St Clair included a CV and a photo of what she described as her
''undraped ample proportions''. She assured the Duke that her skills
were ideal for a marital position at Blair Castle and concluded: ''I
seek a man of worth in order to create length to his lineage, thus I
offer you my services as concubine or wife within a marriage of
convenience.'' The Duke did not respond to the offer.
Privately, he is frequently described as soft-spoken with a retiring
manner, and someone who engenders strong loyalty among his employees and
the locals. Villagers in Blair Atholl were yesterday fiercely protective
of him and dismissed the latest story about the #5 toll for the Glen
Tilt Road as a piece of nonsense.
''He's a great bloke, one of the best,'' said one man. ''He's really
nice,'' said an elderly woman who has lived in the village for many
years. ''He gives a lot of employment for the village, and he wanders
around visiting the shops. He's not aloof or anything. He's very
approachable.''
It was public devotion to the then Duke in 1845 that persuaded Queen
Victoria to grant the family the right to have it's own private army --
the only one in Britain.
The present Duke has described the 80-strong Atholl Highlanders as a
''priceless public relations asset'' and they are paraded in the grounds
of Blair Castle for an annual inspection which is open to the public.
Most of the men are estate workers who are invited to enlist. The
closed ranks have not stopped some determined outsiders from lobbying to
be enlisted, including an exiled Polish prince and an American admiral.
The army is a key attraction for Blair Castle which is Perthshire's
top tourist destination, pulling in 165,000 visitors last year.
The Duke has been keen to encourage visitors to the estate and his
tourism initiatives have ranged from opening the castle grounds for a
variety of major events, such as Scout jamborees and horse trials, to
the production of a small cookbook with recipes culled from a previous
Duke, including hare soup made from buckets of blood, and nettles on
toast.
He has been quoted in the past as saying that the aristocracy has got
to prove its worth to society and that aristocrats are custodians of a
heritage that belongs to all and thus, servants of the public. He is
known to be disdainful of stately home owners who have sold off
treasures and relics.
Asked in 1983 if he would ever put himself on show for the tourists he
replied: ''I know some do. I couldn't. They must need the money more
than I do.''

How a knotty little legal problem, relates Geoffrey Parkhouse, grew
into a club with which to beat John Major.
THE ecologist's connective theory of chaos -- a butterfly flutters its
wings in the Amazon forest and sooner or later the American mid-west is
devastated by a hurricane -- applies in government. The analogy is at
least more elegant than the common one of political banana skins.
Somewhere in Whitehall an Inland Revenue official was fluttering away.
Strictly speaking, insurance pay-outs on mortgage cover should be
taxable. A knotty little legal problem that the Chancellor would have to
attend to in his next Budget statement.
The assiduous Tory backbencher Nicholas Winterton asked a question.
Financial Secretary Sir George Young, notorious for his integrity,
issued a deadpan answer while bureaucracy worked its unhurried way
towards a decision. There is no insurance policy that protects the Prime
Minister from the hurricane that followed the movement of air caused by
the butterfly's wings.
Nobody told him about it. Telepathy between the Treasury and Social
Security -- 50 yards apart -- was absent. Nobody told the Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke; or the party chairman, Jeremy Hanley. Nobody informed
Major's Cabinet troubleshooter, David Hunt. It was not raised at the
political session of the Cabinet last week. Not a mention of it at the
weekly spot-the-problem meeting at No 12 last Monday.
Damage limitation was swift. By noon, the Chancellor (alerted by the
morning press and nothing else) declared: tax on insurance cover on the
mortgages of the sick and unemployed? -- absurd. I shan't do it.
They didn't even bother to find out how much such a tax might raise
for the Revenue. The Government has been advising people to take out
such insurance. And now they were going to tax it? Perish the thought -
local elections were two days away.
These days, any Prime Minister following Margaret Thatcher is expected
to know everything that everyone in government is doing at any time of
day or night. It is an absurd notion of course, but one that political
rivals sustain with great ferocity. Tony Blair was able to mock Major in
devastating fashion again.
Rather unwisely, Chris Meyer, the Prime Minister's spokesman, did not
play it the same way as Sir Bernard Ingham when he was at N0 10. Time
and again, the Ingham cry was: ''Why won't you believe me? This is a
simple cock-up, gettit, a cock-up, not a conspiracy.''
Oh yes, there were plenty of them in Thatcher's time, but somehow they
didn't seem to tarnish the old girl.
Meyer -- and part of his job is to alert the Prime Minister to
potential pitfalls -- has come up through the Foreign Office, where the
Panglossian philosophy reigns. All's for the best in the best of all
possible worlds. This was not a conspiracy and it was not a cock-up
either. It was all part of the normal running of government.
The last bit is certainly true in the case of the Major
administration. Normal running appears to include a weekly gaffe or
cock-up. At last the Labour Opposition is in the ascendancy and the
corollary of this is that the gaffes are compounded and enlarged.
Wilson put the skids under Douglas Home. Thatcher destroyed the
Callaghan Government. When she became accident-prone, her party chucked
her. Blair now has Major in his sights. The nature of cock-ups is that
they make the ministers appear to be either dithering or incompetent.
Nothing goes right for the team in such a run of ill-luck.
It is baffling. There seems to be no defence against it, despite the
inordinate amount of time and trouble taken to avoid them. Successes are
never heard about, failures are beamed into the nation's homes in
minutes. Consider the defences: The Prime Minister has his team of civil
servants, including the press secretary.
Every minister has the same, plus a political adviser. Richard Ryder
has his team of whips, supposedly with their ears to the ground. There
is constant communication between Government departments. Meyer has his
weekly meeting of Whitehall ''spin doctors''. Major has his weekly
meeting of his ''business managers'' -- ministers, whips, advisers,
although this appears to have developed into a mere talking shop. Even
so, gossip is a good protection (perhaps the best) against ambush.
This should be a formidable defence in depth against clangers. But
still the ministers, one after another, tumble into the pit. This is
despite the fact that some of these ministers have been in government
for a very long time; or perhaps it is because they have been in
government for such a long time.
When David Hunt was appointed last year as Major's Chief of Staff, he
was given considerable authority. There is not a cubbyhole in Whitehall
that he cannot probe. There is not a minister who can withold
information from him. Meyer, too, has the Prime Minister's complete
confidence, as do his private secretaries at No 10. Still the cock-ups.
Any Government has to learn to live with cock-ups, but they can
determine the length of a government's life. Paddy Ashdown seems to have
put his finger on it yesterday with the observation: ''There is no small
butterfly that cannot flutter in some corner of the administration but
that it brings about a total descent into chaos and confusion at the
centre.''

CAIRO: The remains of a 4000-year-old pyramid have been discovered
near Cairo by a French archaeological team, an official said yesterday.
Zahi Hawas, director of the Giza antiquities area, said the pyramid
belonged to one of the daughters or wives of pharaonic King Pepi I, the
third king of the Sixth Dynasty.
He said the expedition has been working with the Egyptian Supreme
Council of Antiquities for the past six years in the area of Saqqarah,
12 miles south of Cairo. ''They found a limestone inscribed in
hieroglyphics with Mari Eit Es, the name of the princess and daughter of
King Pepi I. Beside it, they also found the base of the pyramid,'' said
Hawas.

some of Europe's most industrially polluted rivers. ''The level of
dioxin around Venice's petrochemical district of Marghera is double that
found in the Rhine -- one of the world's most polluted ecosystems -- and
some 10 to 100 times higher than those of other European industrial
areas,'' a Greenpeace report said.

A PRISON officer's former wife, who divorced him to marry a prisoner,
told a court yesterday how her ex-husband threatened to kill her.
Dr Phyllis Windsor was giving evidence at a court hearing over the
divorce between herself and Mr Russ Quilty.
Last year she married Stephen Windsor, who was then serving 14 years
after a #60,000 armed robbery, two years after she met him through Mr
Quilty, of Broughty Ferry, Dundee.
Mr Quilty, 37, is suing Dr Windsor, 43, for #40,000, claiming he was
short-changed in the 1992 divorce settlement.
Dr Windsor, a cancer specialist at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, said
yesterday that she told Mr Quilty ''on many occasions'' that she wanted
to leave him after they were married in 1979.
She claimed: ''He would regularly threaten to kill me if I threatened
to leave him or see another man.''
The couple were married only five days after they met at a dance.
Dr Windsor said: ''I was so stupid. It sounds pathetic. I spent 13
years regretting it.''
She claimed that her fromer husband suffered a breakdown only six
weeks after their marriage.
Later, they moved to St Helena, where Dr Windsor had got a job, and
she said that her former husband ''acted strangely'' on the island.
''He pushed my hand through a glass door. I still have the scar on my
wrist. He told people I'd tried to commit suicide.''
She added: ''He told me to keep quiet. He had me in fear of my own
safety.''
Mr Quilty claimed in his evidence that he had been suffering from
depression at the time of the separation and had not realised what he
had agreed to.
The prison officer tried to kill himself after the marriage broke
down, but Dr Windsor said she did not agree with a psychiatrist's
assessment that her former husband was depressed.
She told Dundee Sheriff Court she did not know that Mr Quilty was off
work from September to November 1992 suffering from a ''depressive
disorder''.
Dr Windsor claimed: ''He was leaving for work every morning.''
Dr Windsor, who earns #52,000 a year, told Sheriff John Young that the
separation agreement was drawn up between solicitors and Mr Quilty ''had
every opportunity to get what he wanted.''
She added: ''I wanted things done properly and fairly.
''By that time he could have cleared the house, and I would have been
happy as long as he'd gone.''
She claimed that her former husband was extravagant and added: ''It
was my salary that was funding the extravagance.''
The hearing continues.

A GUNMAN sparked a hostage scare in Aviemore Health Centre last month,
Inverness Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
Frightened staff were evacuated by police after John Gartshore, 40,
brandished a hand-gun in the centre on April 24.
But one woman on an upstairs floor could not be reached as armed
officers surrounded the building, the court was told.
Depute fiscal Vicky Rodger said Gartshore's actions had led police to
believe they were dealing with a serious firearm's incident, with a
woman trapped upstairs in the building. But, she said, the weapon later
proved to be a Browning replica pistol, containing eight dummy bullets.
She said: ''Gartshore repeatedly removed the gun from a waistband,
causing fear and alarm among staff. At one point he slammed it on the
top of a bin.''
Police had already been searching for Gartshore after reports that he
had been acting in an agitated manner in Aviemore, when they were called
to the health centre.
Gartshore, of Milton Park, Aviemore, admitted disorderly conduct,
producing a replica pistol, placing staff in a state of fear and alarm,
and breaking the peace.
Sheriff James Fraser ordered reports and adjourned the case until May
15. Gartshore was refused bail and remanded in custody.

SCHOOLS across Britain yesterday took part in the first National
School Grounds Day, aimed at raising awareness about the importance of
school grounds for educational, environmental, and social activities.
In Scotland, schools as far apart as Fochabers and Hawick put on
playground events. Broughton Primary School in Edinburgh launched its
plan for improving its vast tarmac playground, while St Elizabeth's
Primary in Hamilton planted a cornfield and buried a time capsule.
Ms Kate Kenny, project co-ordinator for the Grounds for Learning
Partnership, said: ''I am delighted that so many exciting initiatives
are taking place in Scotland on School Grounds Day, particularly in
urban areas, and I hope the good work, interest, and enthusiasm will
carry on long after the day's events are over.''
The day was organised by Learning Through Landscapes and funded by
Esso.

THE Duke of Atholl is ''far from being'' one of Britain's richest men,
his estate factor insisted last night.
Mr Andrew Gordon also ridiculed claims that the duke, whose fortune is
estimated at #140m, has been cashing in at the taxpayers' expense at his
140,000-acre Atholl Estates in Perthshire.
Mr Gordon said that the 63-year-old duke has made special plans that
leaves ''all sorts of assets'' to the nation and is not personally very
rich.
He added that some people have said that he is among the most wealthy
men in the country. ''He is certainly far from it as an individual. One
should not take these things at face value,'' said Mr Gordon.
His comments came after the duke was criticised yesterday for charging
visitors #5 to drive along 12 miles of a pot-holed road on his estate.
Visitors claimed the duke was cashing in on a six-part BBC series about
one of his gamekeepers, to be broadcast later this year. One visitor
said: ''Aye, it's a free country all right -- until you arrive in Blair
Atholl, that is.''
The row followed reports that a group on a taxpayer-backed adult
training scheme are working on restoring the duke's 18th century garden
at his home, Blair Castle.
Earlier this year, Tayside Regional Council leader Ewan Dow was so
upset by the Duke's application for #400,000 to plant mixed woodland on
the estate that he called for the introduction of a means test to stop
wealthy landowners qualifying for such assistance.
Mr Gordon said the charge to take cars down the road started in
1980-81, when it stood at #2, because of the damage caused by vehicles.
He added: ''The money goes towards the upkeep of the road, and does not
even cover it.''
The annual maintenance bill was estimated at thousands of pounds,
excluding man hours. The estate ''welcomed the public'', and access was
free to walkers.
Mr Gordon said the duke had merely pursued Government policy in
applying for grants to replant natural woodland, and had spent money
over and above that provided for the forestry.
He also argued that the duke was covering the labour force's transport
and training costs in connection with the garden restoration work. In
turn, the workers were receiving state money above unemployment rates,
and training that would help them find jobs
''We are paying a considerable amount of money to train out-of-work
men and women . . . we are not milking the country of cheap labour,''
said Mr Gordon.
The duke, a bachelor whose heir is cousin John Murray, 64, was not
available for comment.

THE Solicitor General for Scotland, Mr Tom Dawson, QC, is to become a
High Court and Court of Session judge at the age of 46 -- one of the
youngest appointments to the Scottish Bench in living memory.
Mr Dawson was one of two new judicial appointments announced by the
Scottish Office yesterday following the retirement last week of the
country's two oldest judges -- Lord Murray, 72, and Lord Mayfield, 73.
The other new judge will be Mr Arthur Hamilton, QC, a leading member
of the Scottish Bar.
Mr Dawson's successor as Solicitor General will be Mr Donald Mackay,
QC, another leading member of the Bar.
The son of a bank manager, Mr Dawson graduated in law from Edinburgh
University with a first class honours.
He was called to the Bar in 1973 and took silk in 1986.
Married with two sons, he served as a temporary sheriff in 1983 and as
a Crown prosecutor between 1983 and 1987. He has been Solicitor General
since 1992.
He was counsel to the Piper Alpha Inquiry and, in December last year,
persuaded the Court of Criminal Appeal to reject George Beattie's appeal
against his conviction 21 years ago for the murder of Lanarkshire woman
Margaret McLaughlin.
In the course of his submissions, Mr Dawson made a strongly-worded
attack on media allegations that evidence in favour of Beattie had been
suppressed by the authorities.
Mr Dawson described such allegations as ''completely unsubstantiated
and outrageous'' and stressed the Crown was not in the business of
seeking to sustain wrongful convictions.
He added: ''The Crown's position all along has been that a conviction
is proper in this case.''
Mr Dawson's appointment at the age of 46 may herald an era of younger
judicial appointments.
The recently-passed Judicial Pensions Act cuts the retirement age of
judges from 75 to 70 and insists judges must now serve 20 instead of 15
years before they can retire on a full pension.
Mr Mackay, 49, the brother of BBC journalist Alan Mackay, is the son
of a minister, and is married with a son and two daughters.
He graduated from the Universities of Edinburgh and Virginia and was a
solicitor with Edinburgh law firm, Allan McDougall, from 1971.
He was called to the Bar in 1976.
He served as an Advocate-depute between 1982 and 1985 and took silk in
1987.
He appeared at the Orkney Sex Abuse Inquiry and made an outspoken
attack on newspaper reports which had described the hearing as a gravy
train for lawyers and dubbed the advocates in the case as ''Bisto
Boys''.
Mr Hamilton, 52, is married with one daughter and was educated at the
High School of Glasgow.
He graduated from Oxford and Edinburgh universities and was called to
the Bar in 1968, becoming a QC in 1982.
He served as an Advocate-depute between 1982 and 1985, prosecuting in
the case where a Fife paper mill worker ran amok with a shotgun, gunning
down a number of colleagues, killing one of them. The incident was
followed by a police siege.
There is still one more judicial vacancy to be filled, following the
death last week of Lord Morton of Shuna.

THE son of Paul McCartney was airlifted to the Conquest Hospital,
Hastings, last night after being trapped under a Land Rover. James
McCartney, 17, was driving the vehicle on his father's farm near Rye,
East Sussex, when it turned over trapping his foot and, it is believed,
breaking his ankle. A police spokesman said it was not unusual for the
police helicopter to be used, and James was not given special treatment.
The teenager was at the centre of a major rescue drama in September
1993 when he disappeared while surfing on a beach near Rye on his 16th
birthday. His 52-year-old father watched anxiously as lifeboats and a
Sea King helicopter searched for the teenager, who was eventually found
exhausted a mile along the shore.

THOUSANDS of Scottish football fans are being offered their own free
transfer deal next season, in an apparently unique scheme put together
by Glasgow Celtic and Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive.
Supporters who buy season tickets for the Parkhead club will be
entitled to free travel, by rail or underground, from anywhere in
Strathclyde to home league games.
Celtic pipped old firm rivals Glasgow Rangers to the post by
confirming the offer yesterday. The Ibrox club is currently holding
talks with the SPTE and is likely to announce a similar scheme in the
near future, club secretary Campbell Ogilvie said.
The Celtic travel deal is open to all season ticket holding
supporters, including those who live on the fringes of the region, and
it will even cover a #24.50 return rail trip from Oban.
Celtic's public relations manager, Mr Peter McLean, said the club is
subsidising the offer and only a small premium will added to the price
of next year's season tickets.
Mr McLean would not divulge how much the club had paid. However, he
did indicate that season tickets for the main stand will cost around #10
to #12 more than in 1993/94 -- the last season the club played at
Parkhead.
''The club will also run a free bus shuttle service on match days from
Bellgrove Station, Glasgow, to Parkhead, for people who are travelling
this way,'' said Mr McLean.
''We appreciate that some supporters will prefer to travel on
supporters buses. If there are more than 15 people on the supporters bus
then we will pay a refund of #15-a-head.''
Celtic hopes to increase substantially the number of season ticket
holders with the offer -- bringing in extra cash before a ball is
kicked. The club currently has 18,500 season ticket holders.
A spokesperson for Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive confirmed
the deal had been approved in principle, but still required formal
approval from British Rail.
She said the deal would increase the use of the public transport
network and have a knock-on effect in reducing road congestion.
''Free travel will be available for 20 home league games, and
supporters will be given vouchers which they can use. We believe it is
the first time it has been done in Britian,'' she added.
Rangers became interested in the scheme shortly after Celtic, and are
looking at an overall package which will take in car parking, said Mr
Ogilvie.
''We will be progressing the proposal, although we came in further
down the road than Celtic. We haven't got down to talking about costs
yet.''
Mr Gerry Madden general secretary of the Celtic Supporters Association
said: ''It sounds like a good idea to me if it gets more people into
Celtic Park. It's something that already happens on the Continent.''

BRITAIN might introduce extra ferry safety standards independently of
world shipping authorities, Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney hinted
last night.
He also told MPs he ''didn't accept'' the view that another ferry
catastrophe was bound to happen.
Appearing before the House of Commons Transport Committee, Dr
Mawhinney was asked by Labour MP Paul Flynn whether Britain might not
wish to ''go it alone'' on ferry safety without waiting for regulations
from world shipping body the International Maritime Organisation.
Dr Mawhinney replied: ''If Mr Flynn is suggesting there may be scope
for developing regional standards within IMO, that's something which I
would welcome.''
But he also added: ''There is value in having agreements that stretch
across international boundaries.''
Dr Mawhinney was giving evidence to the committee in its inquiry into
cross-Channel safety.
Last month the Herald Families Association, formed after the 1987
Zeebrugge disaster, told the committee of its fears of another ferry
tragedy.
But Dr Mawhinney said the safety regimes in place before the Herald of
Free Enterprise disaster bore no comparison with those in place today.
He continued: ''Neither have we achieved optimum ferry safety. I am in
no way complacent about safety. Safety does not stand still and it is
not the Government's intention that it should stand still.''

A SCOTSMAN who lies in a pauper's grave has left #28,000 to charity in
his will published yesterday.
Mr Brian Fraser-Williamson bequeathed his life savings to two charity
hospices.
Born near Edinburgh and an orphan with no known family, he denied
himself luxuries and saved all of his money, including thousands of
pounds in redundancy payments.
A former engineering worker, he left Glasgow more than 20 years ago.
He was found dead, aged 49, in his one-bedroom council flat in
Kirkstall, Leeds, several weeks ago.
Friends had called on him when he failed to turn up for his usual
drink at the local Conservative club.
Mr Fraser-Williamson had saved hard during 20 years of service in a
stamp shop at a Kirkstall engineering company.
He left his savings to a local newspaper appeal which raises cash to
be donated equally to the Wheatfields Hospice and St Gemma's Hospice in
Leeds.

rate becomes very rapid. Consultant obstetrician John Calvert decides on
a caesarean operation for 10am Wednesday.
Wednesday, May 3 -- 6am: Mrs Battenbough's condition deteriorates
further and Mr Calvert is alerted at home. The planned operation,
lasting less than half an hour, is brought forward to 8am. His theatre
team is Dr Pat Steane, consultant anaesthetist, plus two other
anaesthetists, a registrar, two midwives, and other nursing support
staff.
The baby girl is born shortly after 8am in a ''straightforward
two-minute delivery''. Karen, named after her unconscious mother, weighs
3lb 2oz.
Dr Jean Matthes, consultant paediatrician, is concerned at loss of
blood at birth. Baby Karen's condition improves slightly after a blood
transfusion. The blonde-haired girl is put on a life-support machine and
remains ''critically ill''.
Her father Mike, 30, a care worker with the mentally handicapped, is
kept informed of progress during the operation. He waits in a room close
to the special baby unit. Later, he is able to put his hand into the
incubator and touch his daughter for the first time.
Specialists say the next 48 hours will be critical to the baby's
survival.
Her mother's condition is described as ''quite stable'' after the
operation, and she is able to breathe unaided. Neurosurgeons say she
would not have been aware of what was taking place.

THE discovery of Britain's largest sapphire by an amateur geologist on
the Isle of Lewis now seems likely soon to be a matter for the courts.
By last night there was a demand for an inquiry as to whether a theft
had occurred; a complaint filed with the CID in Stornoway; and a counter
threat made of legal action for defamation.
The news that a 242 carat heavily fractured sapphire and a 39.5 carat
fragment had been discovered by Ian and Linda Combe, who run a craft
shop at Elphin in Sutherland, was first reported on Tuesday. A combined
total value of #210,000 was estimated, but others hold it might be as
low as #500.
The discovery had been made last September by the Combes who, along
with other members of a gemologist party, were sifting through rubble
thrown up by the building of a peat road near Loch Roag on Lewis.
The land had been declared a Site of Special Scientic Interest 10
years earlier when other crystals were discovered.
Stewart Angus, the Western Isles area manager for Scottish Natural
Heritage, which is responsbile for the administration of SSSIs, said:
''We had been working with somebody in the National Museum of Scotland
who had permission to visit the site and look at the spoil only at the
end of the month.
''This had been cleared with the landowner as the law requires under
the Wildlife and Countryside Act.
''When this story came out I immediately phoned the National Museum in
case there had been some crossed wire.'' He wanted to know if the
geologists were acting on behalf of the National Museum, who were the
only people who had cleared anything with his organisation.
Mr Angus went on: ''Our major fear is that the widely exaggerated
figures quoted are going to encourage the worst type of exploitative
elements in society to come and destroy this site. It is tiny and the
chance of finding anything else even worth #500 is about the same as
winning the lottery.
''If you remove something from the countryside which isn't yours, and
belongs to somebody else, it is called theft. The person who owns any
material is the landowner and he asked us to contact the police on his
behalf.''
Northern Constabulary confirmed that a complaint had been received and
an investigation was underway.
Mr Combe last night insisted that he and other members of the group
had permission to work on the material on the side of the road. When
asked who had granted permission, he told the Herald: ''My difficulty is
that we are taking legal advice with a view to taking action. You can't
accuse somebody of theft in this way, but I am afraid I can't say any
more as a result.''
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the National Museum of Scotland in
Edinburgh, where one of the sapphires is on display, said that one
jeweller had valued the gem at around #500, but that was without knowing
its provenance.

<TEXT>
UP to 5000 employees of Highland Regional Council, nearly half the
total workforce, are being asked to consider taking voluntary early
retirement to help alleviate the council's financial difficulties.
The council's manpower director, Mr Adam Braidwood, told the manpower
committee meeting in Inverness yesterday that teachers, home helps,
residential home employees, those providing direct services to the
disabled and mentally handicapped, and others, would not be included in
the trawl.
He said: ''We are entering uncharted waters, and there is no idea of
what interest will be shown. Other local authorities who have done this
have had applications from 20% to 25% of those invited to consider their
position.
''But there is little suitable alternative employment in the Highlands
for those taking early retirement, so it could be different here. There
should be an indication of the level of interest by the end of May.''
The voluntary redundancies are part of a package of cuts agreed last
month by the council as a means of balancing this year's budget. The
council had to find a total saving of #1.3m, and was told by council
vice-convener Peter Peacock that along with the other measures taken,
''if we have an accelerated early retirement programme, we should end
the year in a financially neutral position''.
The matter was also raised at the council's finance committee
yesterday, following the manpower committee meeting. Councillor Isobel
Rhind refused to accept assurances from officials that this move would
also save money for the new unitary Highland Council, since staff taking
voluntary severance would not transfer to the new authority, and
redundancy would not therefore be the responsibility of the new
authority.
But the finance committee decided not to interfere with the manpower
committee's decision.

THE baby born to a mother in a coma was last night fighting for her
life.
Doctors said although still critically ill, the premature 3lb 2oz girl
had ''slightly improved'' through the day.
Baby Karen Bethan Battenbough, named after her unconscious and
paralysed mother, was delivered in an emergency caesarean operation
yesterday at Singleton Hospital, Swansea.
Mrs Battenbough, 24, has lain in a coma for 10 weeks since being
seriously injured in a car crash on an M4 slip road near her home in
Swansea.
Her condition last night was ''stable'' although neurosurgeons have
said her chances of recovering from the coma are ''virtually nil''.
Her husband Mike, 30, a care worker, spent the day at the hospital, to
be with both his wife and his daughter.
Mr Battenbough last night recalled the moment when his daughter was
born. ''As soon as I saw her little face, I saw her mum. She's beautiful
and a real fighter -- just like Karen.
''She's got her mother's mouth, nose, and chin and even the little
frown -- I called it a jib -- Karen used to make when she was
embarrassed,'' he added.
He described how he whispered to his wife: ''You've done it, Karen.
We've got a baby girl. I've called her Karen after you and she's
beautiful.''
But he added: ''Having a daughter is a joyous thing, but my wife is
lying with horrific brain damage and can't ever see her.
''When I feel happy, I feel guilty because Karen is in such a bad way
and when I see Karen I start crying and feel guilty again because I have
a little girl who is so precious.
''I know Karen Louise is going to be OK. The way Karen has fought for
her I feel it's just meant to be.''
Relatives said he was ''overjoyed'' that the baby had been safely
delivered but desperately concerned for his wife.
His aunt, Jill Mattick, said: ''It is a bitter-sweet occasion. There
will be no celebrations because it could mean that Karen is leaving us
soon.''
His uncle, Mr Huw Battenbough, added: ''The baby is something positive
for Mike to aim at. It is as though Karen held on for the birth.
''But the circumstances are so sad. Mike has held up very well and he
can be very proud of himself.''
Mr Battenbough's courage was praised by Mr David Williams, chief
executive of Swansea Hospital NHS Trust, who said: ''He is a devoted and
committed husband and father.
''We feel the next 48 hours will be vital in relation to the baby's
long term prospects. She is in expert and dedicated hands. Our neo-natal
unit is probably one of the most modern in the country after recent
investment.''
Mrs Battenbough was transferred to the hospital on Monday after
doctors at the neuro-surgical unit of nearby Morriston Hospital became
increasingly worried about her condition and the effect on her unborn
baby.
Consultant paediatrician John Calvert brought forward the operation to
deliver the child after further deterioration overnight.
Mrs Battenbough, who has a seven-year-old daughter Sarah Jane from a
previous marriage, lost four babies through miscarriages in recent
years.
Meanwhile, Dr Carolyn Lloyd-Jones, a double transplant patient,
yesterday hugged the daughter she thought she might never have.
Surgeons warned Dr Lloyd-Jones that trying to have a family could be
fatal after she was given a new heart and lungs in an operation six
years ago.
However, the very drug Dr Lloyd-Jones took to ensure her body did not
reject her new organs helped her become fertile.
She gave birth by caesarean section eight days ago to 5lb 4oz Grace.
Dr Lloyd-Jones, 38, who runs a medical practice in Newcastle upon Tyne
University with husband Neil, required the heart and lung operation to
cure a severe bronchial condition.
''The terminal airways to my lungs were blocked off and it was like I
was constantly on the verge of suffocating,'' she said yesterday.
After the transplant, performed by surgeon John Dark at Newcastle's
Freeman hospital, she also had to undergo three bowel operations.
''As Carolyn gradually improved we asked the transplant team what our
chances were of having children,'' said Neil, also 38.
''They said it was out of the question and they did not want her to
get pregnant.
''We weren't too upset -- as doctors we knew the chances were not high
and having Carolyn alive after the transplant was wonderful in itself.''
But the use of Cyclosporin, a rejection drug, meant Carolyn began to
become fertile again.
After reviewing medical evidence from the US, transplant doctors gave
the couple the go-ahead to try for a baby.
Now mother and child are doing well at home in Westerhope, Newcastle,
after the birth -- three weeks premature -- at the city's Royal Victoria
Infirmary.

A YOUTH is expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today following
an incident in which an elderly man landed under a train at the city's
Partick station early yesterday evening.
The 71-year-old man was last night undergoing surgery at the Western
Infirmary. It is believed he suffered head and arm injuries.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail said the incident involved the 16.09 train
from Springburn to Milngavie. East-bound services were disrupted for
about an hour and a half as a result.
British Transport Police last night said that a 17-year-old male would
be appearing in court today in connection with the incident.

MAIL sorter Harry Inns is one of the 22 shop stewards at the centre of
the dispute.
Mr Inns, 35, who works at Edinburgh's Brunswick Road sorting office
and has been with the Royal Mail for 19 years, said yesterday he was
proud to have been one of the band served with repudiation orders by his
own union, demanding he tell members to return to work.
''I have been accused of trying to provoke an unofficial industrial
action. As far as I am concerned, I have only been doing my job as a
union man.''
He disputes claims that public sympathy has fallen for the mail
workers as the strike extended into days, instead of hours.
''If anything, public support seems to have become stronger as the
strike has gone on,'' he said.
Mr Inns claims the roots of the strike lie in the scrapped Government
plans to privatise Royal Mail, which has brought the worsening
relationship between management and staff to a head.
''I think there's been a lot of baying that this is some sort of
militant strike. That is not the case. Our members have been pushed over
the limit.''
The repudiation order, served by his union, called for him to return
to work immediately.
Many of the orders were served on shop stewards in Edinburgh yesterday
by the union's branch secretary, Mr Stuart McIntosh.
Secretary of the city branch for the last two years, Mr McIntosh, 36,
said he had not enjoyed the experience of serving the papers on
long-standing colleagues and friends.
''You feel worried in case people feel intimidated by them. You
certainly don't feel good about it,'' he said.
He fears those involved in the strike could face victimisation.

A COCKER spaniel has won a stay of execution after three judges
allowed an appeal against the death sentence passed on the dog to be
continued.
Five-year-old Kauma was sentenced to be destroyed after it bit a
policeman, but a campaign to spare the dog has attracted 4000
signatures.
The case was due to be heard by Lord Sutherland, sitting with Lord
Johnston and Lord Wylie, at the Justiciary Appeal Court in Edinburgh
yesterday, but lawyers for the dog's owner asked for it to be continued.
Owner Mrs Ann Brown, of Carlisle, was working with her husband Ron at
the Crossways Inn at Gretna when her pet fell foul of the law.
Police received a 999-call to attend the pub and arrived at shortly
after 5.20am on June 21 last year.
Sheriff Peter Watson, who heard the case at Dumfries Sheriff Court,
said Kauma twice bit Police Constable Leslie Kirkpatrick. The dog only
retreated after the policeman kicked it.
The sheriff fined the dog's owner #100 in January after a trial and
ordered the animal's destruction.
Lord Sutherland said yesterday that he would be interested to know why
a variety of papers, including newspaper articles and petitions, had
been put before the court when they had no conceivable relevance.
The appeal judges agreed to continue the case to a date to be fixed.
Meanwhile, Tanya the pit bull terrier was back on death row yesterday.
Her owner said he was devastated after cancelling plans for a reunion
with his molly-coddled dog.
Mr Ronnie Tobin now faces a new legal battle to save four-year-old
Tanya.
Mr Tobin, 28, of Todmorden, West Yorkshire, was jubilant last week
after a sheriff in Orkney found him not guilty of owning an unregistered
American pit bull terrier.
He planned to pick Tanya up yesterday from the kennels in West Lothian
where she had been kept under sentence of death for a year until the
sheriff's ruling.
But he had to call off the trip after being told that there is to be
an appeal against the verdict.

DOWNING Street refused last night to confirm that the Cabinet will
take a decision today on the privatisation of the nuclear industry.
The Department of Trade also declined to confirm earlier reports that
the White Paper on the Government's nuclear review would be published on
Tuesday.
The White Paper cannot be published until the Cabinet have approved
its contents.
The two refusals were giving rise to speculation that privatisation
details are proving hard to finalise, although it was not clear if the
sticking point is the strong opposition of Scottish Nuclear to being
included in a single privatised company with England's Nuclear Electric.
Meanwhile, the STUC's general council yesterday expressed profound
opposition to the entire concept of privatisation of the nuclear

SCOTLAND'S financial standing erupted as a major hustings issue last
night when an SNP budget analysis flatly contradicted new figures
produced by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang in the course of the Perth and
Kinross contest.
A report by the SNP team led by party Treasury spokesman John Swinney
and obtained by The Herald, claimed that the Government's own figures
reveal that relative to the UK as a whole, Scotland has a budget surplus
of #30m in the current financial year.
This came as Mr Lang produced figures which claimed that far from
paying its way in the world, an independent Scotland would face a
crippling budget deficit of #8000m.
Speaking at the adoption meeting for Tory candidate John Godfrey in
Perth last night, Mr Lang said: ''Every promise the SNP makes in this
by-election campaign must be set against that background. Its bogus
claim that Scotland does not enjoy real benefits from the Union crumbles
in the face of facts.''
But the SNP has already gathered its own facts, producing an internal
report of which The Herald had a copy before Mr Lang's onslaught last
night. This draws on the Government's own statistics to paint an
entirely different picture of Scotland raising a share of income
identical to that of its expenditure, with both figures at 9.6%.
A smaller than average share of the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement -- based on a pro rata share of #140m -- then tips the
account in Scotland's favour, giving a budget surplus of #30m.
The report cites two sources. On income, it draws on the financial
statement and Budget report of last November and for expenditure it uses
a House of Commons library document published in March.
Mr Swinney said last night that the report was based on the collection
of quality figures that were up to date and took account of a proper
breakdown, rather than ''the global figures the Tories are so adept at
using''.
He said: ''It is quite clear that the Tories are trying, having
completely lost the argument, to frighten people into thinking that
there is something to worry about. These figures prove there is nothing
to worry about -- the slate would be clean enabling us to build a real
and growing economy in an independent Scotland.''
However, Mr Lang said the Government figures were based on hard
reality. Having proved earlier this year the high cost of devolution, he
had now proved that the cost of separation would be even more dire.
The SNP pointed to the irony of this week's reference by an English
Tory to Scotland as ''the most prosperous region of England'' and said
Mr Lang was trying to have it both ways.
But the Secretary of State said that even if a separate Scotland
received every penny of the #1300m in North Sea revenues it would still
be left with a deficit of #7000m -- equal to half the present Scottish
Office budget.
Meanwhile, Mr Godfrey told his formal adoption meeting last night that
the by-election was unusual in being a ''stark choice'' between the
Union and separation, implying that the contest was a two-way fight
between Tories and SNP.
But Labour candidate Douglas Alexander reeled off statistics to prove
that he was running with the changing tide of opinion, drawing virutally
level with the Tories in the percentage polled at last month's local
elections in the constituency. Labour is setting its sights on the SNP,
claiming its vote share was slipping.
Liberal Democrat candidate Veronica Linklater pitched her appeal on
the basis of a more local geographical attraction, insisting that as the
only candidate with strong family connections in Perthshire she would
mount the strongest challenge in the seat.
SNP candidate Roseanna Cunningham hit back at a suggestion by Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson that Labour would employ truth and
fact to counter lies and smears by SNP and Tory opponents.
''If the Labour Party isn't going to lie in this campaign,'' she said,
''then it will only be because they are not promising a single thing to
the people of Scotland or the voters of Perth and Kinross.''
Mr Robertson, speaking at Labour's opening news conference, had
predicted a dirty campaign based on opponents' lies.
Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign manager, parliamentary Chief Whip
Archy Kirkwood, said his party had by far the strongest candidate and it
was benefiting from the fact that she was not a career politician and
would not be regarded by voters as a party apparatchik.
The extent to which this was the case came up at the press conference
when reporters had difficulty pinning down for exactly how long Mrs
Linklater had been a party member.
But she said the electorate would respond to the fact that she was ''a
Perthshire girl'', and that her interests in education, social work,
criminal justice, and railways mirrored their own concerns. ''I am not a
professional politician but I am a natural Liberal,'' she said.

STRATHCLYDE region is preparing a possible legal challenge to
ScotRail's plans to run midnight ''ghost trains'' over a short stretch
of track in Glasgow -- and it does not want to see them in the
Strathclyde livery.
The new late-night, one-way, Maryhill to Bishopbriggs service has been
allegedly created so that British Rail can avoid court action over
withdrawal of the London-Fort William sleeper service from May 28.
But Strathclyde region, which subsidises a major part of the West of
Scotland's rail network, objects to part of the infrastructure being
used in this way and is seeking legal advice to establish whether court
action is feasible.
Councillor Charles Gordon, chairman of Strathclyde's roads and
transportation committee said: ''Strathclyde is unhappy about facilities
paid for by council taxpapers being used in this inappropriate way. I
certainly don't want a train in Strathclyde livery being used.''
At present the sleeper is the only service using the 140-yard stretch
of line between Cowlairs North and East junctions.
If passenger trains are not run over the track, then this constitutes
a line closure and is subject to far more lengthy and vigorous
consultation procedures than that relating to a service closure.
ScotRail, a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Rail, has consequently
amended timetables to run a 23.58 Maryhill to Bishopbriggs passenger
train. This avoids a public inquiry into the sleeper closure.
Ironically, passengers will be allowed on board a train that is
already making this journey as part of routine operational movements.
Highland region has already mounted a legal challenge to the ''ghost
train'' proposals as part of its campaign to save the sleeper service.
Now Strathclyde region is considering its own legal remedy as a means
of disassociating itself from what it considers to be a shabby
deception.
Councillor Gordon said: ''I think this is a disreputable scam clearly
calculated to avoid proper public scrutiny of a very controversial
decision to withdraw the sleeper service in advance of the formal period
of consultation.''
He pointed out that Maryhill Station was paid for by the regional
council, but legally it was now owned by Railtrack. Similarly, the train
service that runs on the Maryhill line is paid for by the regional
council, but the council does not own the train or the track.

Belfast,
THE Prime Minister rounded angrily on Sinn Fein last night after the
most serious street violence in Ulster since last year's ceasefire.
Defiantly, Mr John Major resumed a visit to Londonderry after Sinn
Fein demonstrators had clashed with police forcing the Prime Minister to
abandon his schedule.
Last night, he said he was looking for Sinn Fein's denunciation of the
violence before confirming next Wednesday's talks in Belfast between the
Northern Ireland Minister, Mr Michael Ancram, and Sinn Fein's Mr Martin
McGuinness.
Before he caught his flight home he said: ''Let us see what Sinn Fein
has to say. Let us see whether they will unequivocally denounce what has
happened this afternoon or not. When we have that sort of information, I
can make a cool and balanced judgment about whether it is practicable
for those talks to go ahead.
''I am not making a snap judgment until I have all the information in
front of me including the reaction from Sinn Fein.''
But did this mean next Wednesday's meeting to discuss the
decommissioning of IRA arms was now in some doubt?
The Prime Minister replied: ''We must wait and see what Sinn Fein has
to say.''
Earlier, dozens of protesters were involved in the violent scenes,
grappling and fighting with police outside the Tower Museum, where Mr
Major was expected to meet city councillors, including representatives
of Sinn Fein.
Twelve RUC officers, two of them women, were hurt. The RUC said one
person was arrested and action would be taken against others.
They said the trouble broke out when a peaceful picket planned to
coincide with Mr Major's visit to the city ''was hijacked by a section
of the crowd intent on causing disruption''.
0 The occasion led to embarrassing scenes for both the Government and
Sinn Fein.
As the RUC attempted to remove protesters who were sitting on the
roadway outside the museum, scuffles broke out and these led to more
serious incidents in full view of a heavy media presence, there to
record Mr Major's visit.
Sinn Fein demonstrators punched and kicked police officers as they
resisted being moved. A metal cylinder was hurled across the roadway,
smashing the rear window of a police car. As the trouble intensified Mr
Major's plans were halted but later he arrived outside the Guildhall in
the centre of the city and continued his visit.
Mr Major defied the republicans by walking the streets of the city
where the earlier bitter confrontations had been a deliberate attempt to
stop him coming.
When the streets had been more or less cleared and after his visit had
been called off he delayed his flight back to London by visiting the
museum behind the historic walls where police and demonstrators had
clashed just hours earlier.
A war of words broke out between Sinn Fein, who claimed the RUC had
been mainly responsible for the violence, and the Prime Minister who
said: ''This is absolutely ludicrous.''
Sinn Fein Councillor Mitchell McLaughlin, who had been expected to
meet Mr Major at the museum, admitted that ''both sides got it wrong''
but laid the primary blame on the RUC, whom he claimed had not been
adequately prepared for what had happened and had overreacted.
But the Prime Minister, in a clearly angry mood, blamed the riot on
Sinn Fein. ''What we saw was a riot organised by Sinn Fein,'' he said.
He demanded that Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, Mr McGuinness, and Mr
McLaughlin, denounce unequivocally the violence of the protesters. He
rejected claims by Sinn Fein that the RUC had reacted roughly, saying it
was quite clear from television film who was responsible.
Mr Major said that what had happened justified the Government's
cautious attitude to recognising Sinn Fein. He said if the party wanted
to be treated like any other democratic party, then it must behave like
one.
He rejected any suggestion that the Ulster peace initiative had been
set back, saying it was a ''good deal bigger'' than what had happened in
Londonderry but he admitted ''some people have shown the wrong side of
politics in Northern Ireland''.
The clashes underline tensions near the surface of Ulster's new
peaceful climate. Sinn Fein protesters have been on the streets several
times in recent weeks but until now police have been able to handle any
difficult situations without serious incident.
The authorities believe that in the absence of violence, republican
activists are now switching towards street demonstrations, directed
primarily at confrontations with the RUC, which Sinn Fein wants to see
disbanded and reformed. The campaign against the Ulster police force is
one of the central planks of Sinn Fein's new strategy and Mr Ancram will
almost certainly be faced with demands from the party towards that end.
The Londonderry violence marred what had otherwise been a
smooth-running visit by Mr Major to Ulster. Earlier, he had met church
leaders and a group campaigning on behalf of the victims of terrorism,
and he had also gone on a walkabout in Belfast city centre where a small
group of Sinn Fein protesters noisily but peacefully staged a
demonstration.
In a keynote speech to a CBI lunch, he called on terrorist groups to
put away their guns for ever. He reiterated that the decommissioning of
terrorist weapons would have to take place and that in the forthcoming
talks with Sinn Fein progress would have to be made on this point.
Mr Major insisted that the issue of decommissioning weapons would top
the agenda between Mr Ancram and Sinn Fein. He also condemned ongoing
activities by terror groups in Ulster, who continue to carry out
punishment attacks and have forced some people to leave their homes.
Mr McGuinness last night insisted his talks with Mr Ancram would go on
as planned next week.
Speaking in Dublin after talks about the Northern Ireland peace
process with members of the Irish Labour Party, Mr McGuinness said the
people of Londonderry had been involved in a legitimate protest.
''The meeting is going to go ahead next week,'' he said. ''But,
obviously in the light of today's events, we will be bringing to that
meeting the handling of today's demonstration by the RUC, making it
quite clear that we find it extremely irresponsible that the nationalist
people of Derry, who sat peacefully on their own streets, should be
treated in such a way by the British Government in such a way to allow a
British Prime Minister . . . to move around the streets of Derry city.''
Meanwhile, the Sinn Fein president was granted permission yesterday to
talk about the Northern Ireland peace process in a room at the House of
Commons today.
Mr Adams will speak in the Jubilee Room, but must not discuss his book
Free Ireland: Towards a Lasting Peace.
The Sinn Fein office in London is trying to find an alternative venue
to launch the book.
The Speaker of the Commons, Miss Betty Boothroyd, refused permission
on Tuesday.

THE Scottish Office last night declined to comment on reports that
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang is fighting pressure from Cabinet colleagues
to cap spending by Strathclyde Regional Council.
It is being claimed that Environment Secretary John Gummer,
responsible for local government south of the Border, and Mr Jonathan
Aitken, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, have argued that it would be
wrong for Strathclyde to escape when eight English councils face
capping.
The council has warned that capping would hit jobs and services. It
has also apparently threatened to challenge any such move in the courts.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''There has been no
decision on capping this year, as yet.'' Asked about the alleged
pressure from Mr Lang's Cabinet colleagues, he said he could not comment
on such speculation.

HOPES of a resumption of mail deliveries across Central Scotland were
dashed yesterday, as ''angry and resentful'' Post Office workers
continued to defy instructions from their union leaders to return to
work.
In the wake of the workers' show of solidarity, one trade union
official said he was not optimistic of a settlement of the unofficial
action -- now in its fourth day -- within the next 24 hours. Areas still
hit are Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, Falkirk, and Fife.
Industrial peace now rests on a further mass meeting this morning in
Edinburgh, to be attended by Mr Alan Johnston, general secretary of the
Communications Workers' Union, who is flying from London.
However, in view of the workers' entrenched position that they would
not accept scapegoats, the prospects of a deal for peace are not
promising.
If workers vote to continue the dispute it will be a bitter blow to
Scotland's business and industrial community, which is already feeling
the effects of a strike which has also reached the courts.
Late yesterday, Lord Gill recalled an interdict he granted on Tuesday
night against the Communications Workers' Union, after accepting the
union was not sanctioning the strike.
Last night, Post Office management which had earlier branded the
action as irresponsible, came under attack from the Scottish Trades
Union Congress as well as from the CWU.
STUC General Secretary Campbell Christie accused them of ''rank bad
management'', and said he fully understood and supported the actions of
workers in walking out. He suggested their mood was ''rather surly and
sour'' following the defeat of plans to privatise the Post Office.
Mr John Keggie, a member of the CWU national executive and divisional
officer for Scotland, said: ''I want to make it abundantly clear that
last week we asked the employers to use the facility of ACAS, which was
declined. We warned them there could be potential industrial action on
Monday, and they chose to ignore that.
''They then suspended people for not being prepared to work to new
practices. It was not sensible to introduce new practices even although
they would say it was to restore deliveries as soon as possible.''
Mr John Mackay, director and general manager of Royal Mail Scotland,
denied claims of sour industrial relations in the Royal Mail. He
insisted last night that he wanted an early settlement to the dispute,
for the sake of customers.
He said: ''There will be no victimisation, nor is there any intention
to take any disciplinary action. We cannot, however, give a blanket
amnesty to everyone because of the possibility that criminal acts might
have been committed during the unofficial action.''
On Tuesday, more than 2000 mail workers walked out when they returned
to work after a 24-hour strike over the move to change the annual May
Day holiday to May 8, to mark VE Day, and were told to work to different
delivery patterns to cope with the backlog.
The CWU claimed members were disciplined after refusing to adopt new
procedures for dealing with heavy volumes of work.
Yesterday, hundreds of postal staff attended a meeting in Edinburgh's
Assembly Rooms, and unanimously decided to continue the action, despite
calls to return to work from union officials. It was the second mass
meeting of the week.
After the latest meeting, Mr Keggie said they had concluded a number
of arrangements with management that would facilitate a back-to-work
agreement. However, he said one of the issues still outstanding was
whether disciplinary action would be taken against individuals who had
been involved in the dispute.
Mr Keggie said officials had advised members of the difficulties they
had placed the union in. The national union had repudiated the action
and advised members they must work normally in compliance with the terms
and conditions of employment.

LABOUR is calling for a full-scale investigation into the role of
former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart in a controversial Loch
Lomond development project following claims that his new job as adviser
to the project's chairman would breach new Ministerial guidelines
expected to follow the Nolan Report.
Front bench spokesman John McFall will today table a series of
Parliamentary questions seeking clarification on the Scottish Office's
handling of a planning application from the Drumkinnon Development
Company.
The company, chaired by former Glasgow provost Michael Kelly, recently
sold its 76 acres of land at Balloch on the Loch Lomond shore to
Dumbartonshire Enterprise for #2.6m.
Last week it emerged that Mr Stewart, who resigned as Scottish
Industry Minister in February, has been hired by Dr Kelly's public
relations firm as an adviser on Government relations.
Mr Stewart denies any impropriety, and has stressed that he had no
knowledge of the Drumkinnon application. Last night he said: ''This is
absolute nonsense. I never made any decisions, I don't recall seeing any
papers at all.''
But Mr McFall claims Mr Stewart's close relationship with Dr Kelly
could have led to a conflict of interest.
However, Dr Kelly angrily denied the allegations last night and
accused Mr McFall of carrying out a personal vendetta against him.
''I understand Mr McFall is after me, not Mr Stewart. I'm at a loss to
understand what he has against me. We are colleagues in the same party.
''If he wanted answers to these questions, all he needed to do was
pick up the phone and ask me.''
Dr Kelly is non-executive chairman of Drumkinnon Development Company,
a consortium formed by Cala Homes and Dixons Commercial Property. The
company had planned a mixed tourism and housing development.
But it met resistance from Dumbarton District Council, and planning
permission was refused. The company appealed to Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang, who indicated that he would grant consent if certain conditions
were met.
Although the Scottish Office claims Mr Lang did not actually grant
planning consent, objectors say that, by signalling approval, he
inflated the value of the land, to Drumkinnon Development Company's
advantage.
Mr McFall plans to raise the matter with the Commons Public Accounts
Committee and with Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler. He argues that,
by accepting a consultancy with Dr Kelly, Mr Stewart is doing what Lord
Nolan is expected to criticise when he publishes his report on standards
in public life.
Having sold the land, Drumkinnon Development Company is no longer
trading.
