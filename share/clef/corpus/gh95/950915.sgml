SCOTS scientists have a date with the 5000-year-old Iceman of the Alps
and they hope to find out what he had for lunch.
Dr Tim Holden and his colleagues at the Archaeological Operations and
Conservation unit in Edinburgh have been promised the stomach of a man,
who was found preserved in a glacier in 1991.
The contents of the Iceman's colon have been recovered, but they
proved difficult to analyse, said Professor Don Brothwell, of York
University.
''Ideally we want some material from the contents of the stomach,
which will be less digested,'' he said.
''I will be interested to see if he ate meat, and if so what kind.''
Another Scot standing by to investigate the Iceman is Dr Jim Dickson
at Glasgow University's Institute of Biological and Life Sciences.
''He is interested in the moss found on the man, because it is
associated with certain areas of the Alps,'' said Professor Brothwell.
Scientists have already found out a great deal about the Iceman, who
is currently in Innsbruck.
He had a bow and quiver of arrows, a copper axe; he also had copper in
his hair indicating that he was one of the first known coppersmiths.
He has broken ribs, three of which were unhealed but had no build-up
of matter round them, indicating that he might have broken them shortly
before he died.
''We think he may have been a herdsman, one of the first farmers, and
was using the bow and arrows to bump off predators,'' said Professor
Brothwell.
''He could have collapsed from his injuries and died from exposure,
but there is no way of distinguishing this from the possibility that
they were broken later by the crush of ice.''
Further information has been found using an endoscope, a viewing
device passed in from the bottom up.
Perhaps the most remarkable achievement has been to date him to 3350
BC.
This was done at Oxford University using a nuclear accelerator to
measure the ratio of two different types of carbon from the carbon
dioxide absorbed by all plants or animals.
Most is Carbon 12, but one part per million million is radioactive
Carbon 14, with a half-life of 6000 years -- half the atoms decay in
6000 years and half of what's left in another 6000 years.
Dr Elspeth Garman, from Oxford, explained that using a new technique,
Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, dating can be done in 15 minutes.
The technique can also be used to compare the inner and outer surfaces
of something as narrow as a hair and detect deposits of heavy metals.
This was how the layer of copper was found on the Iceman's hair.
''My own hair was the first to be tested in this way 15 years ago and
I was shocked at the levels of lead that were found. I cycle around
Oxford and had picked it up from petrol fumes,'' she said.
Could DNA testing identify the Iceman's lineage? Impossible, said
Professor Brothwell. However, he did have a genetic affinity with North
Europeans. It has also been reported that a random sample of 1200
Europeans showed he was related to them all, and the nearest match was a
female Irish accountant living in Bournemouth.

IT is all very simple. If a team cannot retain possession of the ball,
either through the abilities of players to beat opponents or pass
accurately, then that team cannot play football.
In this game possession is not merely nine-tenths of the law, it is
the absolute law in that if you have the ball you cannot lose, and it is
this essential quality which is killing Rangers.
The manager, Walter Smith, is acutely aware of the problem which
showed no signs of easing, even though he selected what, on paper at
least, was a team capable of playing and creating. They did neither and
Smith admitted: ''Retaining possession is our biggest problem.
''We are defending well, but the main disappointment was the way we
gave the ball away, and because of that we never started to play, which
meant we couldn't begin to carry the game to Steaua.''
The Ibrox side started the domestic season well and looked bright and
flamboyant against Raith Rovers last weekend, but the premier division
is not the same as the Champions' League, a competition in which only
those teams in command of the essential qualities do well.
''Even before the draw was made I knew the Champions' League would be
a difficult platform,'' Smith said. ''Rangers are at the stage where we
would get a hard night against any of the Champions' League teams, but
that doesn't mean we can't win games.''
There must always be hope, of course, but Rangers, even with Brian
Laudrup and Paul Gascoigne, appear to be short of what is required.
Steaua Bucharest over-ran Rangers on Wednesday night, and it will be
essential for the Ibrox side to win at home against Borussia Dortmund a
week on Wednesday and the Romanians, who will play at Ibrox in November,
because there would seem to be little chance of them taking all three
points from Group C favourites Juventus.
The Italians opened their quest to win the Champions' Cup by falling a
goal behind in Dortmund and then scored three.
Rangers are hoping to win their home matches against the German and
Romanian champions, but even that is probably asking too much from
Smith's players, who seem destined to suffer from their inability to
keep the ball for long periods.
In Bucharest they gave up possession too easily, which meant that,
while opportunities were not being created for Ally McCoist, the
pressure on his defence was intense.
Daniel Prodan's goal was particularly harsh on Richard Gough and
Gordan Petric, who had been defending well for much of the match, and
who seemed to be coping even after the dismissal of Alan McLaren.
He was sent off with Damian Militaru and both players will be
suspended for their clubs' next games, but they could be punished with a
two-game ban, depending on the referee's report.
UEFA's disciplinary committee will meet before Rangers' next game and
inform them of the decision, but McLaren's dismissal means Smith will
have to put the three-man defensive system he is trying to refine on
hold for at least one match, and that disruption will not do the side
any favours.
Neither will the lacklustre play of Gascoigne, who instead of taking
the ball and making things happen seems more interested in snarling at
referees and opponents.
He must perform for Rangers the way he seems eager to do for Terry
Venables while on international duty. Rangers also need him to be at his
creative and darting best.
They also need Laudrup, who might best be utilised up front, but in a
free role rather than as one of two strikers, to give more than a few
mazy runs in European competition, and it was disconcerting to say the
least that Rangers' two richest talents did so little to hurt Steaua.
These two, I would suggest, are due Rangers some big and influential
performances in the Champions' League, which is their true testing
ground rather than the premier division.
More is required from them than good displays against premier division
opponents, and the jury must still be out on this pair -- and that will
remain the case until they shine for Rangers in Europe.

Dinamo Batumi 2, Celtic 3
CELTIC returned to European action yesterday in one of the furthest
outposts of the Continent, and will return home poised to take their
place in the next round of the European Cup-winners' Cup.
For, in far-off Georgia, the Glasgow side overcame all the problems
that this tie had thrown up to win the first round, first-leg match
against the Georgian side, Dinamo Batumi.
It may not be one of the most famous victories for the Parkhead men,
but it was a vital one in a run of matches which can make or break their
season.
They won the first game of the sequence at Pittodrie on Sunday, and
yesterday, on the shores of the Black Sea, they again won by the same
margin, possibly convincing manager Tommy Burns that his side could go
on a run in this tournament.
Summer signing, German Andreas Thom, scored twice, once in the first
half and then just three minutes from the end.
''It was a team effort,'' said Burns. ''The players were asked to play
in a certain way and they did that. The fact that they scored two goals
in the first half was very, very pleasing.
''They put us under pressure in the first 20 minutes of the second
half, but you have to expect that in Europe. We wanted to come here and
try to score and I think the fact that Andreas Thom scored two and could
possibly have had four says it all.
''We were without van Hooydonk, O'Neil, and McStay, so we have quality
players to come back. As far as the second leg is concerned, we will
have to be positive. Our supporters will be wanting us to score a lot of
goals, but it's difficult because people's expectations are so high. We
are always fighting against that because we want to get there slowly but
surely.''
Celtic overcame all the pre-match problems which had beset them. The
marathon journey, the hold-up at the airport, primitive hotel
conditions, and the sweltering heat could not deny the Scottish Cup
holders the victory they deserved.
Certainly, there were times when Celtic looked too casual, times when
it seemed as if they were giving the Georgians too much space and too
many opportunities. However, in the end it was a victory away from home.
Celtic scored three times, crucial away goals, and Batumi would need a
miracle to knock them out of the competition.
Burns may be unhappy at some of the slackness in defence, but he
cannot regret his summer investment of #2.2m in front man, Thom. Two
goals from him helped clinch this victory and silence the crowd who had
celebrated Batumi's opening goal by setting off fire-crackers.
That opener came after only eight minutes and, at that time, Celtic
were in bother. It was a bad time to lose a goal, and it made things
more difficult for the Parkhead men.
Before Batumi scored, John Collins had shot over the bar and Thom had
come close with a shot. Then, in that eighth minute, the Georgians were
given the lift they wanted. The ball was played into the penalty box,
and Pata Machitadze got to it before the Celtic defenders. His shot
struck Tom Boyd and the ball was deflected beyond Gordon Marshall and
into the net.
The Georgian fans celebrated, their players began to move with
confidence, and Celtic looked up against it.
However, just as on Sunday, they persisted in playing the way Burns
wants -- they passed the ball and built through the midfield, and in 22
minutes they forced a corner on the right. Simon Donnelly sent the ball
back to Rudi Vata, who played it forward into the Georgian penalty box.
A defender miskicked, and the ball dropped to Thom, who volleyed it into
the net.
How things changed. Suddenly, Celtic were the side with confidence.
Five minutes before half-time they scored again. This time Phil
O'Donnell cut the ball back and there was Donnelly to finish things with
a well-placed shot.
Before half-time Thom went close to increasing that lead, but in the
second half, Celtic lost their way and instead of comfortably coasting
towards the next round, they became careless. They lived dangerously,
and paid for it in 65 minutes.
This time it was Temur Tugushi who scored for the Georgian side, with
the Celtic defence once more looking vulnerable.
However, three minutes from time Celtic, snatched a winner. Willie
Falconer, who had replaced Donnelly 15 minutes earlier, sent in a
corner. Andy Walker missed it, but Thom was there to steer the ball
home.
Earlier, there had been two bookings -- Donnelly was shown the yellow
card for walking off the field when he was being substituted, something
the Israeli referee saw as time-wasting, and then Gela Schekilegze was
cautioned for a foul on Thom.
But the worst incident went unpunished. Peter Grant was involved in a
touchline clash and Makharadze spat in the Celtic player's face within a
yard of the referee, but the official waved play on. ''If I had been
younger and less experienced I might have been sent off,'' said Grant.
''It has never happened to me. It's not something that occurs very
often in our own game, but you know that this has happened to other
players in Europe.''
Justice, however, was done. From the throw-in Celtic forced the corner
which brought them their winner.
DINAMO BATUMI -- Baladze, Malanya, Shanidze, Mujici, Shekilegze,
Torgusili, M Makharadze, Machitadze, Tugushi, Udjajqidze, Mindadze.
Substitutes -- Sichirara, D Mackharadze, Glonti, Kantidze.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, Hughes, Grant, O'Donnell,
Donnelly, Walker, Thom, Collins. Substitutes -- Kerr, Falconer, Mackay,
McLaughlin, Gray.
Referee -- Klein (Israel).

ALAN Sugar, the Tottenham chairman, has lifted his White Hart Lane ban
England coach Terry Venables after a plea from FA supremo Sir Bert
Millichip.
Sugar and Venables have not seen eye to eye since May, 1993, when the
coach was voted out as Tottenham's chief executive.
Sugar explained in a letter to Millichip: ''I must put my personal
considerations to one side in order to get behind England's bid to win
the European Championship and restore itself to the front line of world
football.''
The chairman later said: ''I must play my part in helping England win
Euro '96. If allowing Terry Venables access to White Hart Lane helps the
cause, even in a small way, then I have duty to allow him in.''
The decision was greeted with delight by the FA, a spokesman saying:
''What is ultimately important is that nothing stands in the way of
giving the England team the best possible chance of success in next
year's European Championship finals.''

Reykjavik 2, Everton 3
DANIEL Amokachi spared Everton's European blushes with a fine goal in
88 minutes last night which beat the part-timers of KR Reykjavik in
Iceland.
The striker settled this Cup-winners' Cup first round, first-leg tie
with a stunning shot on the turn after the home side seemed to certain
to go to Goodison for the second leg on level terms.
John Ebbrell had given Everton the lead after 22 minutes but
Yugoslav-born Mihajlo Bibercic cracked in the first of his two penalties
after 36 minutes to level the match.
Bibercic slotted home his second spot kick after 67 minutes,
cancelling out the advantage David Unsworth had given Everton from a
penalty after 57 minutes.
Amokachi and Paul Rideout went close in the closing stages as Everton
pressed forward and were rewarded when Reykjavik failed to cut out Gary
Ablett's long throw in and Amokachi, with his back to goal, spun sharply
to fire the ball passed the home keeper from 18 yards.

FRENCH referee Alain Sars said last night that Rangers defender Alan
McLaren's red card in Bucharest on Wednesday was for ''violent
conduct''. That could mean the Scotland international missing a dream
trip to Turin for Rangers' game against Juventus next month.
McLaren and Steaua's Damian Militaru were dismissed after 76 minutes
in the Romanians' 1-0 win. Both are suspended for their clubs' next
games on September 27 -- but they could face a further ban.
''When I whistled for a free-kick to Steaua on the left I was
attracted by my linesman raising his flag,'' said Sars, a 34-year-old
French tax inspector. ''He said to me No.5 (McLaren) and No.8 (Militaru)
had exchanged blows with their elbows. The UEFA observer saw the
incident as well.
''I have written up my report on the match and I have included it as
violent conduct although it is now up to UEFA what action to take.''
Sars also revealed how he feared he had made a mistake in not giving
the Scots a forty-second-minute penalty. He recalled a foul on Charlie
Miller which led to a free-kick. Steaua keeper Bogdan Stelea saved Paul
Gascoigne's shot.
''Have you seen that on television?'' asked the referee. ''I was not
sure whether the foul was inside or outside the box and I wondered if
Rangers should have had a penalty. It was difficult to tell.''
* SCOTT Crabbe will not play again this season after the second injury
blow of his career. The 27-year-old Dundee United striker, who had been
battling back from a broken leg, had a tendon on a kneecap ruptured in
Tuesday's Challenge Cup win over Hamilton at Tannadice.

It is deplorable that so many young
graduates have to start their careers in debt and one has much
sympathy with the young doctors interviewed by Barclay McBain and
Eleanor Houghton (September 4). However, is their plight really so much
worse than that of their contemporaries entering other training?
Take the question of length of training. We are told that the courses
leading to entry into medical practice are longer than those for any
other profession. This is not strictly true.
There is a minority of teachers -- but an important minority,
especially for pupils with university ambitions -- who are required to
undertake five or six years of training. I refer to honours graduate
teachers.
An honours degree requires a four-year university course. To this is
added a year's postgraduate training, and, in the case of teachers of
foreign languages, an additional year's residence abroad, adding up to
totals of five and six years respectively.
It is clear, then, that honours graduate teachers begin earning and
facing the discharge of their debts at approximately the same age as
medical graduates.
What of the salaries from which these obligations are to be met? I
noted that doctors at the beginning of their careers receive #18,000 a
year. Due to apparent restrictions on circulation I was unable to obtain
a copy of teachers' salary scales, so direct comparison is difficult.
However, help was available from the advertisements of vacancies for
teachers under Strathclyde Regional Council.
The basic scales for unpromoted teachers were not indicated, but those
published for promoted posts give some idea of the situation.
The highest salary on offer was #32,505, for the depute head teacher
of Blantyre High School. The school roll was not indicated. There were
24 vacancies for assistant principal and senior teachers at #20,802 per
annum. Candidates for all of these posts will have had a number of years
of successful service, especially in the case of the depute headship.
Surely those figures suggest that, compared to other professions,
young doctors are not all that unfavourably placed when it comes to
salary and debt repayment.
As for expenses, the purchase of a car does indeed impose a burden,
though one wonders about the efficiency and economy of a system which
apparently requires someone based at Dundee to go to work in
Lochgilphead. Nevertheless, surely medical students are not alone in
having to buy instruments and equipment, and I doubt if books on law or
accountancy are significantly cheaper than those on medicine.
I happened to be looking recently at some reviews of history texts.
The first one I came across, which might well have been recommended
reading for an honours student, cost #44.
As for suitable clothing for members of a profession, I have yet to
encounter a doctor, lawyer, teacher, or accountant wearing army boots,
except in the Services. I would not dream of inquiring about the source
of their other garments.
However, if Dr Ogilsby were to visit his local Oxfam Shop, he might be
surprised at the quality of some of the goods for sale, and at some of
the people who are examining and buying them. And the money all goes to
a good cause!

IAN O BAYNE is historically correct in stating that in 1296 the
invading army of King Edward I ransacked the town of Berwick with much
slaughter (September 13).
He would also have been historically accurate in declaring that in
1296 an invading Scottish army pillaged the town of Hexham and burned
alive 200 boys after locking them in the grammar school.
Politically-motivated people exploit such atrocities to advance their
own objectives. Compassionate people regard Berwick, Hexham, and all
other pogroms as sad examples of Man's universal inhumanity to Man.

ALEX Salmond quotes George Buchanan, writing 300 years later, on
Wallace's ''public cause'' (A part of our history that was in danger of
dying, September 6).
Which public? G W S Barrow wrote in Kingdom and Unity: Scotland
1000--1306: ''In 1305 (the year Wallace was executed) the 'poor
husbandmen of the king of Scotland' were able to complain to Edward I
(who by this time had conquered their country) about the one grievance
that irked them more than any other, the precariousness of their tenure:
'they ask that they may enjoy the position of peasants holding of the
royal demesne land in England, so that they shall no longer hold their
land as hitherto from one year to the next'.''

I SHOULD like to point out a couple of errors in the report of the
diving incident involving Mr Cameron Bell (September 1).
There is no such thing as a ''O2 Bend'' attack. It would appear that
two distinct diving disorders have been merged creating a false
impression. These are oxygen (O2) poisoning, which occurs in two forms,
chronic and acute, and decompression sickness.
Chronic oxygen poisoning occurs when the subject breathes O2 at a
partial pressure greater than 0.6 bar for a long period of time, the
symptoms being similar to that of a chest complaint. Acute oxygen
poisoning occurs when the subject breathes O2 at a partial pressure of
1.8 bars or greater; for a diver using compressed air this partial
pressure of O2 is reached at a depth of 80 metres. The major symptoms
are unconsciousness and convulsions, commonly preceded by twitching of
the lips or face.
Decompression sickness, commonly referred to as ''The Bends'' is
caused by Nitrogen gas, which is dissolved into the body tissues whilst
the driver is under pressure during the conduct of a dive, being
released in an uncontrolled manner due to ascending from depth too
rapidly to allow normal dissipation of the gas.
This causes bubbles of gas to be formed, which can lodge in various
parts of the body causing symptoms from mild itching through to limb
paralysis. The only form of treatment, is recompression under medical
supervision in a recompression chamber.
Under normal diving conditions advanced planning and preparation would
take into account several different variations of depth and time,
including accidentally going deeper than planned depth. It does not
automatically follow that an ''O2 Bend'' is the likely result of
exceeding the planned depth.
What happened to Mr Bell if the story reported about the conger eel is
correct, was a freak occurrence and no amount of planning can compensate
for this.
Having personally logged well over 1000 dives I know as well as any
diver that the unexpected sometimes happen, and I am sure I speak for
them all in wishing Mr Bell a speedy recovery back to full diving
fitness.

THE outlawing of Latin and Greek in government departments, such as
the Home Office and Treasury, since their usage is said to discriminate
against non-classicists, must bring a wry smile to the faces of now
otherwise deployed pedagogues in the state sector whose services were no
longer required when the classics were banished from the curriculum.
It is to be expected that those employed in the upper echelons of
government would be well-educated, that Latin and Greek would be the
foundation for a thorough understanding of English.
The latest government directive states that all reports must be
written in clear, plain English. Then, it must think again, since the
vulgarisation of the language is now commonplace, mostly as the result
of the withdrawal of the classics from the school curriculum.
This has led to a bland, inarticulate breed who don't know their
dative from the ablative and think syntax is imposed by Inland Revenue
on houses of ill-repute. They can be seen parading the corridors of
schools shouting, ''The bell has went'' or denouncing a recalcitrant
pupil with, ''We seen you do it, son''.
Remarkably, they do well at interviews for senior promoted posts,
which says little for standards.
It is only a matter of time before government directives are issued in
Sloppyspeak as the new breed struggle with clear, plain English, a
classic in its own right, but only if you know your podex from your
ulna.

ALTHOUGH Braveheart is allegedly ''historical rubbish'', it is a
tremendously enjoyable film which evokes a feeling of Scottish pride.
However, this does by no means justify the kind of manipulation for
SNP propaganda which has been going on as a result of the film's release
in Scotland.
It is both ridiculous and futile to compare Braveheart's inaccurate
portrayal of fourteenth-century Scotland to Scotland as it is now.

I WAS very surprised to read the letter regarding the state of the
Wallace Monument in Elderslie (September 4).
The monument is well looked after, also the remains of the cottage
where Wallace was born, though the plaque at the latter has been
spoiled.
Surrounding grounds are beautifully kept, in spite of litter and
damage caused by youths who congregate around the monument most
evenings.
Considering the monument is so close to a very busy thoroughfare, I
think it is something of which we should be proud.

In his essay, A Scots Mosaic (September 9), Dr Peter Lynch notes that
the Scottish National Party has recently been confronting the divisions
in Scottish society to ''present a picture of a modern, pluralist
Scotland of mixed identities''.
The essay reminds me that 30 years ago on September 29, after years of
protest and campaigning against its undemocratic exclusion from
political broadcasting, the SNP was given its first party political
broadcast. (The allotment was five minutes per annum).
In that broadcast were seeds of the party's current campaign, in the
words, ''If your home is here, Scotland is your country. We want you to
have a secure place in it and a sense of achievement in its democratic
self-government. We ask you to put your faith in Scotland as we do; to
join our ranks; and to vote SNP when given the chance''.
Over 1200 written inquiries for membership and information were
received within four days of the broadcast, including many responses
from viewers who had been born furth of Scotland and had no Scots
ancestry.
In the previous year's General Election the SNP had only 15
candidates, so a great many people at that time had never had a chance
to vote SNP. (Three years earlier it had only 19 branches and a few
hundred members). So 30 years have seen those seeds become flourishing
plants.
There is still quite a way to go, of course, but the rate of growth is
undoubtedly faster and the strength of the roots greater than at any
time in the movement's history.
Dr Lynch rightly highlights the importance of Alex Salmond's
initiatives, which are so welcome.

WHEN even the Governor of the Bank of England is reported as saying
that ''big increases in house prices may be over'' (September 13) you
know it must be true.
Your leader on the same subject correctly draws out the quite separate
-- and in many ways more benign -- Scottish housing market context.
The problem is that in the run-up to the November Budget, the
Chancellor is under pressure to prod the housing market into life,
through measures such as reversing the withdrawal of mortgage tax
relief.
The Treasury being a UK department, such fiscal measures will apply
bluntly throughout the UK, paying little heed to the very different
conditions in real local housing markets.
There is a danger that in attempting to stimulate the housing market
in Kent, the Chancellor will apply quite inappropriate pressures to the
markets in Scotland.
There is a remarkable complacency about home-ownership prospects in
Scotland. At times the ''wha's like us'' spirit is revived as we
congratulate ourselves as canny Scots in avoiding the disastrous
pendulum of house-price change seen in the south.
But while the Department of Environment now talks of ''sustainable''
home ownership and lenders prepare for downward adjustment of the
market, Scottish political virility is still being drawn from crude
targets for the increase in home ownership.
When allied to a withdrawal of public sector investment in housing of
#1.2 billion in the last seven years, one wonders if the idea of a
sustainable balance in renting and owning has really sunk home.
We may well be into a period of long-term low inflation which will
remove the fuel for housing market boom and bust. But at the same time,
the changes in the labour market, towards less secure incomes, remove a
basic prop of the home-ownership market. In setting home-ownership
targets this really does not appear to have been thought through.
Shelter's concern over Scottish complacency on housing has led us to
organise a major and unique conference in late October at which we will
seek the views of lenders, builders, academics, politicians, and
landlords in articulating a clear Scottish consensus.
By that time Kenneth Clark may already have completed his Budget
speech. In the meantime he should resist the calls for short-term
measures and think seriously about the merits of investing in real
alternatives to mortgage debt.

THE deputy chairman of the Kelvin Conservative and Unionist
Association introduced (September 13) an excellent variation of the
traditional rapists' plea at trial, ''She said No, but she really meant
Yes''. He claims, without any evidence, poll result, authority, or
proof, that almost everyone who says Yes to a Scottish parliament really
means No.
Now if he had claimed that almost everyone in the Scottish Unionist
Party had lied in their teeth after Ted Heath's Declaration of Perth, he
would be right.
We are also faced everywhere with Unionist claims of financial
prowess. Please explain the following. UK national debt in 1992: #155
billion. Same at beginning of 1995: #285 billion -- and accelerating.

WHAT really upsets Michael Fry other than his vivid memory of Salman
Rushdie's unpleasant personality (September 13)?
It's a cliche that no correlation exists between high cultural
achievement and a judgment about the moral worth of an individual.
Nevertheless, Fry's list is highly selective. Each artist there is
damned by his Modernism. So too are the train of sycophants and band of
hangers-on at the heart of the metropolitan communication industry.
That's the stuff Goebbels used to blether in the thirties.
During that era, Cambridge turned out a few renegades. Fry's
generation under Maurice Cowling's tutorship in revenge turned out the
likes of Portillo, et al.
Once, the voice of true British liberalism sneered with effortless
superiority; now it pouts in imitation of John Bull. No wonder Rushdie
turned renegade.

THE Channel Tunnel is a fact, and that is the most important aspect of
the troubles affecting its owners. These are financial, and concern the
way in which the money was raised for its construction. The civil
engineering behind it was remarkable, though it took longer to complete
and encountered more difficulties, and thus higher costs, than had been
anticipated. The Labour reaction to its cash-flow problems is worrying:
would it really have been better had the enormous costs of the Chunnel
been imposed on the two governments? Should, indeed, any of the costs be
imposed now? Almost certainly not. Like the whole North Sea oil
industry, the Chunnel has been financed at no cost to the state, and the
fact of its existence means that even if its creator company is forced
into bankruptcy, the physical asset will remain intact for the benefit
of users. There is little advantage in trying to make political capital
out of the present financial problems, which ought anyway to be capable
of solution.
The fundamental problem is that too much of the project was financed
by borrowings (and ran into a period on both sides of the Channel when
high interest rates compounded the cost of servicing that debt). In
retrospect it would have been better to have financed the business even
more by equity, but not only Eurotunnel's management, but the whole
international financial community (as testified by the galaxy of bank
lenders) was hugely optimistic of the project's monetary success. The
difficulties -- and disagreements -- of construction undermined this
optimism, which seems also to have paid far too little attention to the
way in which the ferry companies would react to the potential loss of
their business by cutting their prices.
The affair is an almost classic example of the way in which free
markets work, with the main beneficiaries being cross-Channel travellers
who are now being courted with lower and lower fares. The potential of
the trade can be established by one fact -- the number of cross-Channel
travellers has risen by 30% this year -- and there is the possibility
that Eurotunnel could trade out of its difficulties, although that is a
possibility rather than a probability.
Things will be clearer 18 months from now when the suspended interest
payments will be resumed. The company's British chairman, Sir Alistair
Morton, spoke of ''shared pain'' being necessary between lenders and
shareholders. Though he may generally remain too optimistic about
Eurotunnel's position, that statement is hard to fault. The banks will
not get all their money back -- the real worth of their debt is far
below its nominal value (which is why they have agreed to the present
dispensation) and shareholders will have to accept the dilution of their
equity on a scale certain to defer returns into the next century, even
though their company has already become the main cross-Channel
transporter.
The Chunnel will never take all the cross-Channel business. For some,
their claustrophobic reactions alone might be enough to keep the ferries
alive. There is too a certain romantic appeal in a sea crossing, though
the duty free attraction may be shorter-lived than it seems at the
moment when it confers a definite advantage on the ferry operators. The
ferry companies are engaged in a fierce struggle to ensure that at least
one survives, but an equally attractive strategy may force them
effectively to merge. Eurotunnel may not survive. Its fate hangs in the
balance, for its main asset is really worth less than it cost. Its
struggle to bring that fact into a financial equilibrium which ensures
its own survival will be watched with interest, but otherwise should not
affect users.

LAST week's Scottish CBI dinner was a most amusing event. (Readers
will appreciate that this is the kind of statement with which one is
encouraged to open columns in the modern Labour Party.) But actually,
it's also true.
This was in part due to a funny speech from Howard Davis, who was
demob happy from the CBI, en route back to the Bank of England where, as
he pointed out, the term ''carpeting'' has taken on a whole new meaning.
But by far the greatest amusement lay in the reception accorded the
principal speaker, the Rt Hon Ian Lang, who opened by repeating his
tiresome, but really quite revealing, little joke about having gone
overnight from being a Viceroy to a President (of the Board of Trade).
Geddit? The man's a scream.
To say that Mr Lang bombed in front of what might have been a
sympathetic audience is a modest understatement. The captains of
Scottish industry were spectacularly underwhelmed. Sir Michael Hirst's
gallant efforts to lead a standing ovation only added to the hilarity.
When Howard Davis stuck the knife in (with a realistic account of the
British economy), twisted it, and drew a laugh-a-minute in the process,
the entertainment was complete. It's a pity deadlines dictate these days
that what actually happens after teatime is so seldom reported; only the
press releases.
Mr Lang made the basic mistake of patronising a sophisticated audience
by talking what most of them, from daily experience, recognised as
arrant nonsense. The first part of his speech was devoted to an account
of the Government's unalloyed success in matters of economic management.
That, to put it mildy, is not how most companies see it.
He then abused his platform by launching an ill-judged, full-frontal
attack on the Labour Party in general and its proposals for
constitutional reform and a minimum wage in particular. He incited his
audience to rise up against them. Sir Michael Hirst duly rose.
Firms who take tables at CBI dinners may, in the majority, have
Conservative sympathies (though it is far from a general truth) and
those who are invited as guests are not so naive as to expect a
non-political evening. But the crude, humourless party diatribe which Mr
Lang launched into went far beyond the bounds of common courtesy.
Much more important than the niceties, however, was the fact that his
speech offended many of those present on the grounds that they didn't
believe a word of it. As one businessman observed to me: ''What's he
talking about? A Scottish parliament couldn't do as much harm to my
company in a decade as Black Wednesday did in a day.''
The following day, Mr Lang's great pal the Prime Minister was in
Scotland with a similar script for a wider audience. Dark tales of
mammoth tax burdens were spun by this great leader who has, by his own
Chancellor's account, imposed new taxes equivalent to seven pence in the
pound, since 1992.
There are doubtless some people in Scottish business and industry who,
on the whole, would prefer to see the constitutional status quo
maintained. They are too busy running their companies and keeping people
working to be terribly worked up about the subject one way or another.
But they are also, in my experience, conscious of the community in
which they operate and of the political mood for change. They are
anxious to communicate their concerns to Labour politicians and to make
sure they are taken account of. They are interested in dialogue, rather
than abuse or a great counteroffensive which requires them to sign up
for Mr Lang and all his works.
What they see in Scotland is the Labour Party having, through the
Constitutional Convention, gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that
a devolved parliament would be genuinely representative of all interests
rather than dominated by one. It is difficult for anyone to reconcile
that approach with the parody paraded by Mr Lang.
There is also increasing recognition of the Tory posture, that only
rigid adherence to the status quo can defend the Union, as a fraud.
Indeed the opposite is true. Major, Lang, and Forsyth telling the people
that they can have absolutely no constitutional change, no matter what
they think, is a far greater threat to the Union than the SNP has ever
been on its own account.
I signed up in 1989 for the Constitutional Convention because I
believed it did represent a genuine attempt to find a considered,
democratic consensus. It has done a spectacularly good job, and is now
subjected to the daily sneers of the two political forces which cannot
afford to see it succeeding -- right-wing Tories and hard-line
separatists.
Most folk can see a wide avenue running through the middle of that
unwholesome alliance. The simple fact is that if Labour emerges as the
next government, there will be constitutional change. If the Tories win,
there will not. Similarly with the minimum wage. If Labour wins there
will be one; if the Tories win, there will not.
On both counts it really is as simple as that. I don't understand why
some people who, on both issues, should be on the side of change are
prepared to put the divisive detail before the stark principle, which is
where the real political divisions lie. Perhaps they should be forced to
listen to Mr Lang more often.

THE Prime Minister demands fresh ideas. Why does that prospect fill us
with alarm? Brainstorming sessions, for that is what took place at
Chequers yesterday, are not always a good idea. Almost by definition
they are a galvanising sort of affair and the implication to be drawn
from this is that there is a need for people to be shaken or to shake
themselves and produce new, vibrant ideas. That is not the way that the
best thinking is done. Cabinet Ministers, who have been rubbing along
doing jobs in a variety of ways, ranging from competent to the opposite,
are suddenly required to produce a raft of ideas which will win the next
General Election and carry the Tories on a flood of radical legislation
into the millennium. This is a false situation and a false hope. Any
Cabinet Minister worth his salt will have been introducing fresh
elements into his work as he went along. Any Cabinet Minister who has
not been doing this will probably be unable to do so, or at best will
produce some very silly ideas in haste. The hallmark of brainstorming is
often just that, silly ideas. The poll tax was a product of think-tank
brainstorming (how aptly those double-barrelled words sit together) and
look at the trouble which it caused.
A further problem with this approach to generating new policies is
that it is not one to which Mr Major is well-suited. His strengths are
often in the detail of policy and in the patient development of often
complex positions, perhaps best seen in his dogged determination to push
forward the peace process in Northern Ireland. Dramatic gestures, big
ideas, new and radical solutions are just not his style. Glancing
through the already well-trailed list of measures which can be expected,
it would seem simple folly for Mr Major to be in any way involved with
forcing schools in England and Wales to opt out. Nor should he be seen
within a million miles of Mr Howard's ridiculous scheme for US-style
''boot camps'', designed perversely, it seems, to toughen up young
offenders so that they may re-offend more effectively. The danger is
that this sort of approach to policy will lead to the drafting of hasty
legislation. This is always a mistake and the history of the Tory
governments of recent years has been littered with over-hasty and faulty
legislation which has had to be amended in the light of experience.
Legislation is, or should be, a slow and careful act. It should not be
the result of brainstorming.
In one respect at least, some of the Ministers gathered at Chequers
must have relished the opportunity to make a presentation. For spending
Ministers it was a chance to repeat their tales of woe if their budgets
were to be cut further. This is probably at the core of the leak from
Mrs Shephard's department about the problems of properly financing
education in England and Wales. Mrs Shephard, whether or not she used
the words in the leaked document, will have sought to hang on to her
existing budget, or even to increase it. Mr Peter Lilley, who has
already said that his department cannot reduce its spending from the sum
already agreed, will have pledged his support to long-term measures to
review the benefits system and to place the emphasis on personal
provision for redundancy, sickness, and the effects of old age. None of
this will be of much help in the approach to the next General Election.
The best hope for Mr Major is to steer an unadventurous course, for
experience has shown that the least diversion into eye-catching ideas
will quickly have him on the rocks.

David Belcher talks to Glasgow-based DJ Michael Kilkie whose horizons
stretch far beyond the city where he learned to make a dance-floor heave
WHILE some humdrum disc-spinners have greedily revelled in a new-found
stellar status, there's one Scottish clubland DJ who, despite being
poised this week on the brink of top-20 chart action, remains
commendably down-to-earth. Michael Kilkie is committed to learning his
craft, quietly working away, taking care of daily business, shifting the
product in practical hands-on fashion in the retail front-line.
Michael is half of the backroom team behind Umboza and their debut
single, Cry India (Positiva). Another Scot, London exile Stuart
Crichton, is the other half.
''I'm not musical, while Stuart is, very -- but he's never in clubs,''
reveals Michael, whose weekly DJ'ing residencies are at Glasgow's Bar 91
on Thursdays and the Ark at the Tunnel on Fridays. The Umboza
partnership is based on Stuart's production abilities and Michael's ear
for a winning musical phrase or sample -- Cry India features a choral
snippet from Lionel Richie's All Night Long -- plus his knowledge of
what makes for a heaving dance-floor.
And what does?
''Break-downs. Where the music almost completely drops out of a
record, leaving a bare keyboard riff. Before there's a gradual
instrumental return -- beginning with the drums, say -- you've got
two-three seconds in which a dance-floor crowd can make their own noise.
It works for me.''
Work, work, work: Michael does. Always has.
He stumbled into the DJ's booth in Fury Murry's by accident at the age
of 15 when his then-girlfriend's big sister wanted someone to play her
fave indie discs while she and her student pals danced to them at a
night they christened Freewheelin'.
Coincidentally, it was around this time, circa 1988, that DJs became
freewheelin' superstar mood-manipulators to the masses, not merely
saddoes stuck behind a lightbox in the corner. Michael saw his chance,
chucked his O-grades, and began a gruelling DJ apprenticeship.
He secured a full-time YTS sales post at Glasgow's hippest
dance-discerie, 23rd Precinct, thus hearing the choicest pre-releases.
He haunted clubs in spare daytime moments, subjecting the cleaners to
his emergent twin-turntable skills, and DJ'd for real at night.
During Glasgow's year of culture Michael would be finishing in clubs
at 5am; arriving home in Erskine at 6am; and heading back by bus to 23rd
Precinct at 8am. In the years since, he has graduated to running 23rd
Precinct's Limbo label, acting as its chief talent-spotter.
Later this month, though, he'll be back at the sharp end of the
record-retailing game, busily setting up a 23rd Precinct franchise in
Edinburgh's Cockburn Street. He'll continue to DJ in Glasgow, of course,
as well as undertaking frequent guest spots in clubs around the globe.
Ireland, Jersey, Denmark, Switzerland, Canada; Michael's DJ'd there. And
in Japan. But don't remind him of Japan.
''A new club opened in Osaka. Japan is mad for cheesy rave, and the
new club was meant to be hipper, more underground, more Western-styled,
so I sent them a condensed 20-minute tape of my stuff. I was offered a
lucrative three-month contract, and everything seemed brilliant.''
But it wasn't. There was a bad start when Michael, who didn't have a
work-permit, was held at the airport and had his passport briefly
confiscated. The club itself operated from 6pm to midnight, playing
terminally-ungroovy 2 Unlimited records. The audience were equally
unadventurous.
''There were some young people, but it was mostly businessmen in suits
on their way home from work. I came on and the dance-floor emptied.''
Repressive Japanese protocol then came into play. The head DJ spoke to
the entertainments manager, who spoke to the owner, initiating a series
of pronouncements.
''First it was 'Play our records.' Then it was 'Tuck your shirt in and
tidy yourself up.' Finally I was told: 'Come in early to practise . . .
here's the microphone, do the raffle.' '' Exit Michael after six
miserable days.
Other DJ'ing catastrophes have been minor in comparison, the most
notable occurring in London's trendsome Milk Bar at the launch of a
Limbo compilation album alongside Limbo label-mate and crucial DJ Harri.
What went wrong? Michael ended up with Harri's headphones Superglue'd to
his hair after Harri had repaired them over-hastily.
Amusing now; amusing then. Perhaps this sort of experience is handy in
ensuring you maintain a sense of realism. You mustn't get upset by
whatever sticky mess the music industry lands you in. Messrs Kilkie and
Crichton are certainly keeping their feet glued firmly on the ground
about Umboza, having recently auditioned the two boys, Tony and Jason,
and two girls, Abbie and Alicia, who will be Umboza's public incarnation
for clubland touring purposes.
Michael and Stuart were happy simply taking a Hitchcockian cameo role
in the Umboza video: they're in the background for 15 seconds playing
tom-toms. ''We're not the least bit envious about being in view . . .
although if we make Top Of The Pops we'll be digging the tom-toms out
sharpish.''
Further backroom toil beckons alluringly. Crichton is working with
ex-ABC frontman Martin Fry on a re-launch of the latter's career as well
as with Heaven 17's Glenn Gregory. Having jointly re-mixed the Grid's
Swamp Thing last year, the Crichton-Kilkie production axis have been
approached by other acts. The first fruit of their re-mix labours will
soon be heard on the re-release of Limbo's It's What's Up Front That
Counts by Yosh.
What of Umboza's recording future?
''Positiva, an offshoot of EMI, are looking to build long-term acts,
not just release sample-based singles. Our next single actually features
another big sample which is presently in the process of being cleared,
but for the third one we hope to go down the M People road . . . using a
vocalist and writing songs.''
Positiva have an option on an Umboza album, with Cry India already
licensed for the Christmas edition of the venerable, mega-selling Now
That's What I Call Music series of compilations. Before then, Michael
hopes he won't be too busy to assist with a putative soundtrack role in
the Tron's production of Anthony Neilson's play, Penetrator, scheduled
to run from November 22 to December 3.
More immediately still, there'll be a special early-evening party on
Sunday in a top Glasgow eaterie at which all ears will be attuned to
Radio 1's run-down of the latest top 40. Having notched big pre-sales
figures in advance of Cry India's release on Monday, Umboza will have
been up against major newies from Prince and David Bowie as well as
Shaggy's Boombastic, supported by TV exposure on the latest Levi's TV ad
campaign.
Whatever transpires, Michael Kilkie won't be fazed. After all, he

'It really started just before, and
then during, the World Cup when
I became aware that the rugby
picture was changing.'
HASTINGS the international was rarely limited in his talent on the
field. Now he will be the head of Hastings International Limited, his
own business.
The former Scotland full back confirmed yesterday that he is to leave
the David Murray owned Carnegie Sports International, for whom he has
worked for four years.
On top of that, Hastings also has plans to throw his hat into the ring
as agent for the Scottish squadalthough they already have an agent in
former Scotland captain Ian McLauchlan.
Never one to shirk challenges anywhere in the field, the Scottish
Claymores American football team also could come under his commercial
influence, and not, as had been suggested, as their goal-kicker.
There will be a press statement released by his club, Watsonians,
today for whom Hastings also will be working. As reported in The Herald
earlier this week, it seems that there to be an announcement of an
investment by millionaire businessman, John Connor.
It is understood that Watsonians have already set up a limited company
and it will be in a position to employ players on a payroll.
Watsonians failed earlier this summer to sign New Zealanders Sean
Fitzpatrick and Andrew Mehrtens who had been invited to join the club,
but if it had not been for the invitation coming from Hastings himself,
it is unlikely that the two All Blacks would have given the topic much
thought.
''I have a number of consultancies with companies on a marketing
front, and I look forward to starting my own business and making it
grow. At the moment, Carnegie are still taking calls, but I am looking
for my own offices and staff,'' said Hastings.
''I have been working for the last couple of months towards this, with
the full knowledge of Carnegie and David Murray, and it really started
just before, and then during, the World Cup when I became aware that the
rugby picture was changing. I don't want to reveal the companies that I
will be working for at this stage, but there are some press conferences
lined up soon.
I
Carnegie intends to work with Hastings as mutually beneficial
opportunities arise, and the former Scotland captain, who has been
shunning the limelightas speculation mounted as to his future, has
chosen now to reveal his plans because of the rumours. One of those was
that he was to try to become the agent for the national squad after
retiring from competition himself.
''The international squad is an interesting area. I have kept in touch
with a number of players. I understand that they are meeting on Sunday,
but I will not be at that meeting. I hope to continue to discuss certain
topics with them,'' he said.
''If there are opportunities in the future then I will consider them
on their own merits. I am well positioned to be able to offer some sound
advice.''
Much has been made in the press about possible links with the Scottish
Claymores. It was mooted that he was to be their kicker, and while
Hastings refused to comment on the matter, I understand that he is to
act for them on the commercial side, and a further press conference is
lined up for next week.
In the immediate aftermath of the decision that rugby is to turn
professional Hastings says that some of the statements from thehierarchy
have been hypocritical. ''I find it strange that after the big
announcement about professionalism, the SRU have appeared to qualify
their statement and have advised clubs not to pay players.
''If the game is to be professional, then players should be able to
make a living from it. There is much to be discussed, but I believe that
you cannot deliberately make it a two-tier system and the SRU are wrong
to think that they can. If someone wants to pay club players, and those
club players want to be paid, then it should be allowed to be like that.
It will find its own level,'' he said.
This is the first comment that Hastings has made on the topic since
the announcement that the game was to become professional, and it would
appear that Hastings is a powerful advocate of the professional ethos
and will continue to endeavour to make the word less blasphemous in
rugby's douce circles. Whatever, he now finds himself like many others
in the ranks of the self employed, and only he can sustain the aura that
surrounds him on a long term basis.

BOXING
FRANK Bruno been offered #3.3m to defend his newly-won World Boxing
Council heavyweight title against Lennox Lewis next year.
The bid, made to American promoter Don King, has been submitted by
Lewis's backer Panos Eliades, who contends that his offer will be more
than any money put on the line by King to bring together Britain's
present and past world heavyweight champions.
If there is no acceptance -- and the mandatory period does not begin
until September 24 -- Eliades has asked WBC President Jose Sulaiman to
call for purse bids by October 9, when the biggest money put up will get
the fight.
Lewis won the right to fight for his former title by stopping Lionel
Butler in an official final eliminator in Sacramento in May, but Mike
Tyson's release and immediate elevation to No.1 in the WBC rankings
threatens to complicate the issue in the high-powered world of
heavyweight boxing politics.
First, though, Lewis has the none-too-easy task -- on paper at least
-- of trying to overcome the dangerous Tommy Morrison in a 12-round
non-title bout at the Atlantic City Convention Centre on October 7.
Lewis said: ''Right now, Bruno is keeping my title warm. He can't call
himself a champion, because another British champion, me, has beaten
him.
''All the talk of Bruno-Tyson is a red herring. It's not embarrassing
for me to chase Bruno. I don't know what all the fuss is about.
''Brunomania is only going to last until I get to him.
''I think what he's done is good for British boxing. I'm happy for
Frank because he's worked so hard to reach his goal. But he's only going
to be champion for a little time.''

THE concept of pay talks being staged at Murrayfield, as they will be
tonight and again next week, indicates just how far and how quickly
rugby has moved in the past three weeks. The 100-plus clubs in
membership of the Scottish Rugby Union will gather for the first time to
debate the implications of the International Board's Paris Declaration
which brought an end to more than a century of amateurism.
But the crux of the matter is that, to the vast majority -- meaning
all but the dozen or so clubs with aspirations to spearhead the Scottish
game -- the debate over payment at club level is a complete and utter
irrelevance.
Melrose, with the revenue generated from their spectacularly
successful seven-a-side tournament, are generally considered to be one
of the wealthiest clubs in Scotland. The tournament generates a profit
of around #25,000 which, coincidentally or not, just about equals the
cash excess remaining in the Greenyards' coffers at the end of last
season.
Melrose secretary Stuart Henderson declared: ''As things stand just
now, there is just no way that we could afford to pay our players. We
just don't have that kind of money.''
Henderson, like every other club secretary in Scotland, will tonight
be looking for a consensus to emerge. ''We are still trying to come to
terms with everything that has been happening over the last few weeks
and it is certainly going to take a year or so before anyone can say
with certainty how professionalism will develop.''
That being the case, the sensible approach is surely to stalk the
professional monster from a safe distance -- a 12-month moratorium on
club level payments providing breathing space.
In a purely Scottish context, surely the clubs can reach an
accommodation which would be binding for a year, and this would put the
focus on the country's top 16 clubs who will meet the SRU once again on
Tuesday night.
The issue of pay-for-play is, even this early in the debate,
developing a two-tier structure. There is no doubt that the
international squad -- which has its meeting with IB representative Fred
McLeod on Sunday -- will be paid and in this context it is encumbent
upon the SRU to come up with a package which does not leave the players
at a marked disadvantage to their international rivals.
This means that the union's commercial and marketing wing will have to
sell the game like never before. The union has said that the players
will receive only what the game can afford, but the corollary of this
rather too simplistic statement is this. If Scotland wishes to retain
its seat at the game's top table can it afford to throw in its
part-time, semi-professionals against the full-time professionals of the
southern hemisphere?
The answer to that question lies very much in the hands of corporate
Scotland and with the public at large.

Hans Peter Kuhn explains to MARK FISHER the secret of his long
collaboration with Robert Wilson
DOWN in the dank warehouse cellars of the Clink Street Vaults, the
hospital beds, the artful debris, and discarded shoes, Robert Wilson's
HG installation is starting to take shape. I meet up with Hans Peter
Kuhn, Wilson's long-time musical collaborator.
The two have been working together on and off since 1978, both on
theatre productions, including Dr Faustus Lights the Lights seen at the
Edinburgh Festival of 1993, and on visual arts-based pieces such as
this.
We head up into daylight, out of the damp and cloying atmosphere and
on to the narrow streets between Southwark Cathedral and the Thames
(Shakespeare's Globe Theatre is being rebuilt just around the corner).
Bypassing Robert Wilson himself, who appropriately is admiring someone's
shoes, we settle outside a riverside pub, the helicopters chopping
overhead like the found sounds in one of Kuhn's own compositions.
Kuhn is far from your average soundman. Not for him the two minutes of
incidental music shoved in during the final week of rehearsal to smooth
over some scenic transition, like so much aural wallpaper. Describing
himself as a composer and sound artist, Kuhn treats his compositions in
much the same way as Wilson treats his visuals -- creations that are
integral not additional to the work as a whole.
That's why he leapt at the chance to work with Wilson when they first
met at the Schaubuhne Theatre in Berlin nearly 20 years ago. Already
growing frustrated with the limitations of conventional theatre, Kuhn
found in Wilson a kindred spirit, someone whose work was abstract and
creative. The two have gone on to make around 30 pieces together.
''The best case you have with most directors,'' he says, ''is that
they hire you as a composer and then they tell you 'well, I need
something after scene five and something after scene seven', it's a
piece of sound because it says in the script that the doorbell is
ringing. There are a few people who use sound creatively, like Robert
Lepage, but not many, which is why Robert Wilson and I have stayed
together so long.''
Kuhn also works independently on his own installations, like the one
he created in London three years ago on five floors of a vacant office
block, each floor with its own special sound; and more recently, a piece
designed for a bridge in Spain with speakers projecting sound from
either side. He's also done music for radio plays and for dancers
including Laurie Booth.
''It's very difficult to write about sound,'' he admits when I suggest
that his chosen field, a form that is barely 20 years' old, is not fully
appreciated by public or critics.
''You can say it sounds like a cat or it sounds like a car squeaking;
that's understandable, but it takes away a lot, because even though it
may sound like a cat, that's not the only thing there. You would never
say it sounded like a flute or it sounded like 24 violins, you would
talk about how it was played or the structure of the piece. There is no
vocabulary available for this kind of work.''
Using familiar sounds to trigger imaginative responses in the
listener, Kuhn builds up a series of repeating pieces that either exist
independently or reflect the atmosphere of Wilson's physical
environments.
In one room in HG, for example, Kuhn simply amplifies the existing
acoustic. Elsewhere he uses artificial soundscapes that could
theoretically happen anywhere.
''I do control it,'' he says. ''There's no way that I couldn't. But
I'd rather everyone had their own idea about what's going on. I have to
be aware that most people will only stay for a few minutes so the loops
of repetition are not extraordinarily wrong. But the material is not
dramatically built so it doesn't matter if you don't hear everything.
''At any time during the run there will be different combinations of
sound because all the pieces are of different length -- people won't
notice but it's important to me because it has to do with life, it's the
same but it's changing all the time.''

* ABERDEEN University have forfeited the right to play in the second
round of the SRU Tennents 1556 Cup. The students were to have played
Penicuik in a first round tie last weekend but, initially, decided to
forfeit the game because the bulk of their players were on tour in South
Africa. Hearing that sanctions might be taken against them by the SRU,
the students then agreed to play but the match was cancelled because of
the weather.
The tie has been awarded to Penicuik who will play Perthshire in round
two on November 19.

THE new national league set-up, in only its third week of play, faces
a vital weekend. In the first two weeks, north clubs have had by far the
better of the exchanges, and last week's defeat of south division one
champions, Oban Camanachd, by Glenurquhart has set alarm bells ringing.
Already, Oban Celtic, who qualified because of Kyles Athletics'
decision not to take part in the new set-up, have emerged as the premier
division's whipping boys. They have conceded seven goals in both their
outings and could be on the wrong end of another hefty defeat this
Saturday when they take on Newtonmore.
If Oban Camanachd fail to take points off Kingussie, then the league's
critics could have a field day, with the top division rapidly heading
towards north domination. If that situation was to persist, south clubs
would almost certainly consider opposing what was agreed as a one-year
pilot scheme.

SELECTIVE breeding for bigger and better milk-yielders is increasing
dairy cattle susceptibility to environmental mastitis, a leading
veterinary surgeon has warned.
In conditions of stress, such as around calving time, this can have
fatal results for the cattle unless spotted early enough and treated.
Peter Orpin, a committee member of the British Cattle Veterinary
Association, is calling for dairy farmers to work closely with vets in a
series of workshops to improve early identification and treatment of the
complaint.
A survey carried out by Schering-Plough Animal Health shows that more
than 70% of UK dairy farmers have lost a cow from toxic mastitis,
averaging two losses every five years. The disease costs an average
100-cow producer more than #3000 a year.
''Recent research has shown that cows have been bred for rapid milking
with the ability to produce one pint every four seconds. This has
markedly increased susceptibility to mastitis,'' Mr Orpin said.
''Acute toxic mastitis should be viewed as a true veterinary
emergency. Recent advances in therapeutics have greatly improved
prognosis for this condition but the success is still largely dependent
on the farmer's skill and judgment and further farmer education is
therefore the key to success.''
The implementation of an industry-wide five-point plan for mastitis
reduction in the late 1960s had resulted in a cut in the rate of
clinical cases from 135 per 100 cows to 40 by the late 1980s,
principally through reduction in contagion. But environmental mastitis
infections have remained at 7% making it more of an issue.
Mr Orpin said there was a need to add a sixth point -- management of
the dairy environment. ''There is enough E coli in one dung pat to wipe
out the national herd,'' he pointed out.
Schering-Plough will be staging a series of ''mastitis alert''
workshops in association with vets throughout Britain starting next
month. This follows the success of their beef calf workshop sessions
introduced last year.

''I have hit the ball well all year,'' explained the Aboyne player.
''I started putting better in the English and it was still there in
Sweden, so I am looking forward to this week.''
Fairclough, winner twice this year, is also in good shape after
finishing third last Sunday behind Swedes Lotta Neumann and Annika
Sorenstam in the Trygg Hansa Open at Haninge, near Stockholm.
Belgium's Florence Descampe returns to the American Express Tour after

FORMER world snooker champion Joe Johnson has decided to ignore his
wife's pleas, and stay in the game, despite his latest heart attack.
The 43-year-old, world champion in 1986, suffered the attack during a
tournament last weekend and underwent open heart surgery on Monday after
tests showed three arteries were blocked. Johnson said from hospital in
Leeds yesterday: ''I've still got a tournament or two in me. I am
concerned about my health, but I am more bothered about being able to
justify my place in the game.
''I had three maximum breaks in the build-up to the Blackpool
tournament where I had a heart attack in the middle of a frame. I went
on to win that game, so I can't be that bad.''
His wife, Terryl, had previously begged Joe to give up the game for
the sake of his health. He suffered his first heart attack five years
ago.
She said: ''He has many wonderful memories through his career and done
so much that I hope he will retire gracefully.''
Joe, whose seventh child Joshua was born 14 weeks ago, has now pledged
to pack in his 15-a-day cigarette habit.
The player, ranked 52 in the world, hopes to return to his home in
Calverley, near Leeds, at the weekend.

SCOTTISH and Irish Euro-MPs have joined forces to demand tough new
curbs on the ''cruel'' live export trade to countries outside of the EU.
Strathclyde East MEP Ken Collins, chairman of the European
Parliament's environment committee, said animals were in some instances
being condemned to sea voyages of three weeks before slaughter. And he
said the trade was costing EU taxpayers more than #250m a year in export
subsidies.
Mr Collins has written to the EU agriculture commissioner Franz
Fischler asking him to summon the Irish agriculture minister for talks.
About half of the 270,000 animals involved in the live export trade
annually come from Ireland.
''These animals are not covered by welfare rules that apply to the
transport of animals within the European Union. That should be changed
immediately,'' said the Labour MEP.
He called for the matter to be discussed by EU agriculture ministers
when they meet in Brussels on September 18.
Responding to public outrage, farm ministers reached agreement earlier
this year on strict rules for the transport of cattle, sheep and pigs
within the 15-nation bloc, but exports to the Middle East or North
Africa, common destinations for British and Irish shipments are not
covered.
Dublin MEP Bernie Malone accused the Irish government of hypocrisy. It
had made ''a song and dance'' about its welfare rules within the EU but
was turning a blind eye to non-EU export.
* THE Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is
expanding and re-organising its inspectorate arrangements.
Edinburgh Lothian and Borders area is to be brought up to full
strength by the appointment of a new chief inspector, while in Fife a
new station will be created to improve cover in the central part of the
region.
The society will also recruit a new auxiliary inspector to help cover
the Kintyre peninsula when the station at Lochgilphead is closed later
this year.

SANDY Lyle, for the fourth successive Ryder Cup will be on the outside
looking in, but he gave an untimely reminder of his talent with a
nine-birdie 66 on the opening day of the British Masters at Collingtree
Park yesterday.
''A month too late,'' he commented after moving into a share of the
lead with Swede Mats Hallberg and Frenchman Jean-Louis Guepy.
Lyle said in June that European captain Bernard Gallacher would be
''an idiot'' not to pick him the way he was playing. Yet the 37-year-old
Scot is still searching for his first win for three years and there was
simply no way Gallacher could have gambled on him.
It is one of golf's more remarkable statistics that Lyle has not
played in the cup since he became the first Briton to win the US Masters
in 1988.
He would have been in front on his own over the Northampton course but
for hitting a cart path and going out of bounds on the 401-yard
seventeenth, his eighth.
It cost him a double bogey 6 and he also bogeyed the short fifth but,
apart from that, it was the Lyle of old. He was on the green at the
543-yard eighteenth with a huge drive and No.4 iron.
Lyle will not be on the Concorde flight to Rochester, New York, on
Monday, but he does want to spend more time in America. He is looking to
follow Nick Faldo and rejoin the US Tour next season. ''I just feel I am
playing better now and can handle America a lot easier,'' he said. There
is, however, a dispute over his exempt status to be cleared up first.
Sam Torrance and Mark James, the two oldest members of Europe's team
at Oak Hill, were the two who did best at the start of the final warm-up
event.
Torrance, 42, and James, 41, both scored five under par 67s and lie
joint fourth with Jersey Open winner Andy Oldcorn and Spaniards Santiago
Luna and Miguel Angel Martin.
''Life's pretty good at the moment,'' said Torrance, who in the last
three months has been enjoying what he believes to be the best spell of
his 25-year European Tour career.
The run began when he won the Irish Open. Since then, the popular
Scot, who will be winning his eighth successive cap at Oak Hill next
week, has had three runners-up finishes -- two of them to Colin
Montgomerie in the last three weeks.
He had to be patient yesterday as only one birdie chance was converted
in the first 10 holes, but he then made four more, the last of them
after hitting his ball into a water hazard.
''I nearly went swimming,'' he said. ''The ball was just on dry land,
but the bank I had to stand on was almost going under. It was sinking a
wee bit, so I just gave it a quick hit and got out of there.'' He struck
his pitch to 12 feet and made the putt.
Montgomerie was five under as well until bouncing into water at the
short fifth -- his fourteenth -- and had to be content with a 69, the
same as Seve Ballesteros.
Yorkshire's Howard Clark returned a 70, Swede Per-Ulrik Johansson 73,
Ian Woosnam, and Ireland's Philip Walton 74s and David Gilford a 75.
Woosnam's round included a 7 at the eighteenth, where he hit his
second into the lake and three-putted, and a missed 18-inch putt on the
fifth.
Hallberg is currently 118th in the Order of Merit and needs one more
good cheque to avoid a seventh visit to the tour qualifying school.
But Guepy, born on the Pacific Island of New Caledonia, has already
won nearly #100,000 and last week shot a course record-equalling 62 in
the Lancome Trophy in Paris.
Others shining yesterday were would-be Scot, the Dalmahoy-based Andrew
Oldcorn, on 67, and undisputed Scots Andrew Coltart and Gary Orr on 69.

EARLY disposals of its Keebler businesses in the US are crucial to the
future prosperity of United Biscuits, which plunged dramatically into
the red at the interim stage.
Pre-tax losses of #48.5m in the 28 weeks to July 15 compared with
profits of #76.2m for the first 28 weeks of the previous financial year.
However, the heavy losses were the result of #79.1m of exceptional
charges relating principally to United Biscuits' expensive disposal,
announced yesterday, of its loss-making Spanish snacks operation to
Galletas Siro of Spain, as well as to past and anticipated losses of
Keebler salty snacks, and reorganisation in Australia.
After July's profits warning, news of a fall in pre-exceptional,
pre-tax profits from #76.2m to #30.6m came as no surprise.
As announced in July, the interim dividend is slashed from 5.5p to
3.5p and the final is almost certain to be cut from last year's 9.8p.
Second-half profits should be significantly better than first-half
earnings but will be lower than the #57.6m in the latter half of last
year.
During the first half, United Biscuits continued to pour money into
the black hole of Keebler salty snacks.
Between mid-May, when the company decided to sell this operation, and
July 15, its losses of #8.1m were taken as an exceptional charge. With
United Biscuits anticipating another #10.7m of operating losses before
the business is sold, the total exceptional charge in the interim
accounts for the salty snacks business was #18.8m.
Keebler's other two businesses, biscuits and frozen foods, are also up
for sale. The division as a whole made an operating loss of #2.6m in the
first 28 weeks, a disastrous result compared with a #19.5m profit in the
same period of the previous financial year.
United Biscuits would not give any details of its ''delicate
negotiations'' concerning the sale of the three businesses but hopes to
make an announcement by the year-end.
Chief executive Eric Nicoli said partnerships for the operations had
not been ruled out, although new chairman Colin Short stressed the
company's preference was a complete withdrawal.
There is little doubt that, with the millstone of Keebler removed from
its neck, United Biscuits could enjoy better fortunes.
And John Parker, food manufacturing analyst at broker BZW, believes Mr
Short, a non-executive director of United Biscuits since 1992 who joined
full-time from ICI on July 1, is taking a more forceful stance in
tackling the company's problems than his predecessor, Sir Robert Clarke.
However, Bill McCall, an Edinburgh-based director of stockbroker
Tilney, said: ''What we are disappointed about is that, while they
continue to talk about selling Keebler, there is nothing actually
happening with it.
''Everyone in the food industry must know Keebler is up for sale yet
they haven't been able to sell it.''
Mr Short said he could understand analysts' unhappiness about the
absence of news of a sale.
The exceptional charge for the disposal of the Spanish business
included a #30.5m goodwill write-off, an accounting adjustment which
does not affect the operations of United Biscuits.
This disposal, and the hoped-for sales of the Keebler businesses, will
free up resources to pursue growth opportunities in Europe and in the
Asia-Pacific region.
In the UK, KP snacks, McVitie's biscuits and Ross Young frozen and
chilled foods will be vigorously marketed.
Meanwhile, United Biscuits' gearing continues to rise. During the 12
months to July 15, it rose from 64% to 93%.

A CAREER-BEST 174 from opener Nick Knight put Warwickshire firmly in
command of the race for the Britannic Assurance County Championship
title yesterday.
The reigning champions reached 309 for three before bad light ended
play at Canterbury.
Dermot Reeve and his side claimed three bonus points which puts them
18 in front of Middlesex, whose game with Somerset failed to start.
Knight shrugged off the disappointment of being overlooked for
England's winter tour to South Africa, as he hit his first three-figure
score of the summer.
The eighth championship hundred of his career came in three hours 10
minutes off 153 balls, and included twenty-one 4s and a 6 before he was
caught by Matthew Walker at point off Mark Ealham.
The rain at Taunton saw Middlesex's slim title chances recede still
further. Scores:
At Derby: Derbyshire 267 (P A J DeFreitas 94 n.o.); Lancashire 134 for
eight (I D Austin 59 n.o., D G Cork 5-58).
At Chester-le-Street: Durham 258 for two (W Larkins 113 n.o., J E
Morris 109) v Nottinghamshire.
At Chelmsford: Essex 313 (R J Rollins 63, N Hussain 58, P J Prichard
54), Yorkshire 53 for one.
At Canterbury: Warwickshire 309 for three (N V Knight 174, R G Twose
54 n.o., Wasim Khan 51) v Kent.
At Leicester: Gloucestershire 196, Leicestershire 57 for one.
At The Oval: Hampshire 185 (M P Bicknell 4-65), Surrey 71 for two.
At Hove: Sussex 104 for two v Northamptonshire.

BRAD Faxon was the pick of six US Ryder Cup players in action at the
#665,000 BC Open in Endicott, New York, yesterday, firing a
four-under-par opening round 67 to finish one shot off the pace.
Steve Lowery and Skip Kendall share the lead after having shot 66s,
but with the Ryder Cup just one week and 120 miles away, all eyes were
on the US hopefuls who will be defending the trophy.
Faxon was one of 12 players tied at four-under, while team-mates Jay
Haas and Fred Couples were a stroke behind. Davis Love III shot a 69,
Peter Jacobsen a 71, while Loren Roberts was the only team member over
par at En-Joie Golf Club, shooting a two-over 73.
Lowery and Kendall both shot bogey-free rounds and will be determined
to keep their form going for very different reasons. Lowery is looking
for his second win and enough extra money to secure a place in the
season-ending Tour Championship, while Kendall needs to make at least
#66,000 in the next six weeks to keep his Tour card.
''My hopes are not super-high this week,'' he said. ''I'd just like to
have a good solid tournament. If I end up having a chance to win, that'd
be awesome.'' Scores:
66 -- Steve Lowery, Skip Kendall.
67 -- Ed Fiori, Steve Rintoul (Australia), Mike Standly, Andrew Magee,
Ted Tryba, Brad Faxon, Jay Williamson, Ken Green, Jeff Sluman, Craig
Stadler, Steve Pate, Phil Blackmar.
68 -- Bobby Wadkins, Greg Kraft, Joey Sindelar, Kelly Gibson, Wayne
Levi, John Schroeder, Bill Britton, Dicky Thompson, Carl Paulson, Paul
Goydos, Guy Boros, Marco Dawson, Fred Couples, Jay Haas.
Other scores included:
69 -- Craig Parry (Australia).
73 -- David Frost (S Africa).
75 -- David Feherty (Britain)
* RYDER Cup team members Sam Torrance and Philip Walton are among the
European Tour stars who will be involved in a new matchplay event being

LEGAL &amp; General's shares benefited from bouyant profits growth and a
higher than expected dividend in the first six months of the year,
rising 18p to 565p. Pre-tax earnings doubled to #117.1m, towards the top
end of City forecasts.
The interim dividend is raised by 11% to 7.7p.
The general insurance business did well making a profit of #29.6m
compared with a loss last time of #6.7m. This was due to stronger
investment returns from bond and equity markets and maintained levels of
underwriting profit on the property account. Funds under management rose
from #31.3bn to #36.4bn. The estate agency business reduced its losses
to #1.7m from #2.1m.
Profitability grew by only #3m in the main life and pensions business
to #85m with consumers still put off by industry mis-selling and changes
associated with the introduction of costs and commission disclosure in
January. Encouragingly, the volume of UK life and pension sales rose in
the second quarter although they remained below the level of last year.
Product innovation remains high on the agenda with the company hoping
to win market share through competitive pricing. An extended range of
new healthcare products are soon to be launched.

<HEADLINE>Inflation rises as retail sales fall</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE rate of inflation rose to
3.6% last month, and retail sales fell unexpectedly by almost a full
percentage point, adding to the confusion over the state of the economy
and intensifying pressure on Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to take steps to
protect the recovery.
Although inflation remains at a historical low, the increase in both
the headline rate and the more significant underlying rate, which rose
to 2.9%, came at a bad time for the Cabinet as it met at Chequers to
discuss ways of reviving Tory fortunes.
The Treasury acted swiftly to talk down the figures. Economics
Secretary Angela Knight said: ''This is another set of figures showing
that inflationary pressures are subdued. Underlying inflation has now
been below 3% for two years -- the longest period since 1961.''
Reaction in the City was muted, but the Opposition parties accused the
Government of economic mismanagement, and retail organisations called
for an immediate cut in interest rates.
Labour's Shadow City spokesman, Alistair Darling, said the poor
figures reflected the true state of the British economy: ''They are an
indictement on the Government's handling of the economy and show that
inflationary pressures are reappearing in an economy which is flat.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said the
figures proved the extent of the Tories' economic mismanagement. ''Only
this Government could be so incompetent as to preside over rising
inflation and economic stagnation at the same time.''
The figures do nothing to resolve the debate over interest rates. The
Bank of England and the City of London have, until recently, pressed the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, to dampen inflationary
trends with a rise in rates.
But other recent figures, and the unilateral action by a number of
banks and buildings societies earlier this month to reduce their
mortgage rates, have appeared to reinforce Mr Clarke's policy of
resisting calls for an increase.
The retail price index rose by 0.5% in August to 149.9, to leave
headline inflation at 3.6% in the 12 months to August, after remaining
at 3.5% in June and July. The underlying rate, which excludes mortgage
interest payments and is considered a more reliable indicator by
economists, rose to 2.9%.
A 13.1% rise in seasonal food prices in August -- the highest monthly
rise since January 1979 and the highest in August since records began in
1956 -- was offset by a fall in motoring and other personal costs.
Despite City predictions of an increase, retail sales fell in August
by 0.8%. The figure puts the annual rate of increase in sales at 0.4%,
compared to 1.3% in July, and adds to the Government's fears that the
recovery in the high street may be faltering.
Mrs Knight suggested the August heatwave may have been responsible for
keeping people away from the sales. But City analysts suggested the
figures reflect deep-seated consumer unease.
James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, said:
''We have now reached the stage where the lack of consumer confidence,
the static housing market, low inflation and modest increases in retail
sales, combine to warrant an interest rate cut. We encourage the
Chancellor to act soon.''
British Chambers of Commerce deputy director-general Richard Brown
said: ''Retailers continue to try every trick in the book to pull in the
customer, but if prices continue to rise we can expect still further
closures and retrenchment.''

WILTING under the pressure of ever increasing debts, Eurotunnel has
told its 225 banks that it has suspended payment of interest on its
#7800m of loans for up to 18 months.
At present, interest payments total about #1.95m per day and so the
cross-Channel tunnel operator is deferring payments totalling almost
#1100m.
The decision was forced on the company as revenue targets have fallen
far behind expectations, and the #525m it indicated at the time of the
#858m rights issue in May 1994.
The shortfall could amount to well over #100m, despite traffic figures
in August which saw 850,000 passengers using the tunnel and claims that
with a total of almost 149,000 vehicles it had gained market leadership
with 39% of total cross-Channel traffic.
On current estimates, Eurotunnel would have run out of cash on October
31.
The co-chairmen, Sir Alastair Morton and Patrick Ponsolle, were both
at pains yesterday to emphasise that services will not be affected in
any way.
Sir Alastair said it was very unlikely indeed that Eurotunnel would go
bankrupt, and certainly not in the foreseeable future. He added that
closing the tunnel down would not make sense as ''you cannot sell a hole
in the ground for much if you have closed it''.
City opinion is that the banks would not wish to force the ultimate
sanction of bankruptcy as they would lose everything.
Instead, they are faced with the dilemma as to whether they should
forgive a substantial part of the debt, convert much of it into equity
to reduce the cost of interest payments in the hope that there will be
an eventual return or else help arrange a new injection of equity.
The company has denied that it has approached either the British or
French governments for financial assistance. In any case, the
governments are precluded specifically under legislation from such
action but they will be pressed to remove the duty free concessons now
enjoyed by the ferry conpanies and which are worth about #100m a year.
However, the European Investment Bank and the European Coal and Steel
Community have joined the panel of Eurotunnel's four leading commercial
banks to negotiate a settlement. The six organisations are the largest
lenders to the project.
Eurotunnel finance director Graham Corbett said that the governments
could act to correct distortions in competion between Eurotunnel and the
ferry operators as they have a role to play as infra-structure planners.
The price war between the two modes of transport has intensified in
recent weeks with over one-third of Eurotunnel fares now being offered
at a discount.
Eurotunnel shares plunged 14p to 142p, while its debt which is traded
between banks fell 8% to 50%.

WHATEVER the state of Eurotunnel's finances, there is no question that
the tunnel is making severe inroads into the market shares of the ferry
operators, and is continuing to gain ground.
The resulting competitive scramble has been good news for
holidaymakers, pushing ferry prices down to levels not seen in years.
P&amp;O's ferry trading profits were 19% down at #24.8m and the group
pre-tax figure was marginally up at #126m for the six months to June.
The results were below market expectations, not so much as a result of
the lower ferry outcome, which came as no surprise but more a poor
performance from container shipping. The shares tumbled 28p to 509p. The
interim dividend is pegged at 13.5p.
Eurotunnel and P&amp;O dispute who is top dog on the Channel but the
tunnel will have the biggest share in the end. P&amp;O chairman Lord
Sterling is confident a substantial share will remain for his group.
There is also stiff competition between the ferry operators and Lord
Sterling reckons there will be a shake-out within the next two years
which will leave P&amp;O on top among the remaining ferry companies.
Now the tunnel is providing full competition, the Government may relax
its ban on any alliances between the ferry operators, and P&amp;O remains
keen on having links with Stena and Hoverspeed.
The volume of cross-Channel traffic is increasing year by year and the
extra capacity should be absorbed eventually. P&amp;O expects the outlook to
become clearer in a year or so's time. The group operates four ships
between the Scottish mainland and the Orkneys and Shetlands, but the
business is dominated by the Dover-Calais run.
The main problem in the first half was container shipping, where
profits tumbled 43% to #15m, reflecting adverse exchange rates and
higher fuel costs. Currency movements cost some #11m. P&amp;O is responding
by cutting costs further and seeking links with other shippers.
Cruising was 12% ahead at #48.2m and would have been more had not the
Star Princess run aground in Alaska. This will give a #7m hit in the
second half. Meanwhile, bookings are strong, and the rich American
couples who patronise cruise ships are apparently getting excited over
the 77,000-tonne Sun Princess -- the largest cruise liner of the lot,
which is due to make its maiden voyage in December.
Bovis Homes managed to hold profits and an improvement is seen in the
second half as completions rise. Construction was predictably depressed.
Lord Sterling sounded reasonably upbeat for the rest of the year,
commenting that he would be ''very surprised if we didn't have a very
reasonable second half''.
He said ferries were performing with resilience; bulk shipping, which
moved from losses to profits in the first half, was benefiting from
firmer rates; the Australian interests were doing well; and increased
returns were coming from property.
This suggests full-year profits ahead of last year's #349m, possibly
at around #380m.

BRITISH Aerospace may have lost out to GEC in its battle to acquire
submarine manufacturer VSEL, but the company is fast building up its
bridges elsewhere after past disappointments, and yesterday's half-year
results were well received with the share price firming 27p to 677p,
writes CHRIS STONE.
BAe, which recently won a #650m order to supply regional jets to
Belgian national carrier Sabena, safeguarding 2500 jobs, including 400
at Prestwick, has increased profits before tax and exceptionals by 113%
from #75m to #160m. Its bedrock defence business improved from #221m to
#240m on sales up from #1998m to #2050m.
The further improvement in operating margin reflects further cost
reduction and a shift from development activity towards a higher
proportion of production work.
Airbus continued its profitable growth which, with reduced regional
aircraft losses resulting from the decision last year to cease
production of the jetstream 61, helped reduce the Commerical Aerospace
losses from to #59m from #79m on sales of #678m, against #643m last
time.
BAe's decision not to proceed with the bid for VSEL resulted in the
cancellation of the rights issue funding proposed earlier this year.
However, it remains committed to its strategy to pursue broader
applications for its prime contracting skills.
0 Meanwhile, BAe's forward order book at the end of June for defence
stood at #8300m, providing a ''solid basis, and excellent visibility of
future performance in this sector over the medium term''.
The interim dividend is hiked from 4p to 5p on earnings per share, up
from 9.3p to 23p, excluding exceptional items.

A large part of the #22.3m improvement came from a one-off profit of
#18.2m on the sale in June of the group's interest in north American
paper and pulp producer Donohue Inc.
The group's balance sheet and cashflow is strong, enabling it to
comfortably fund its various media investments. Pensions payments halved
in the period and are expected to be on a much lower level in the
future. Net debt reduced by #51m to #331m with gearing falling from 64%
to 53%.
Earnings per share soared in the first half to 11.1p from 6.6p. The
interim dividend is lifted 20% to 1.2p per share from 1p.

BRITISH Polythene Industries yesterday announced its biggest
acquisition move for several years, in the form of Leeds-based flexible
packaging group Parkside International.
The 80.4p per share ''paper'' element of British Polythene's agreed
offer, pitched at a 58% premium to the 51p price of Parkside shares at
Tuesday's close, values Parkside at about #24m.
Parkside shareholders are being offered two British Polythene shares
for every 17 in the Leeds-based company. There are both cash and loan
note alternatives, each worth 75p per share, which value Parkside at
#22.4m.

I TRY, in modest ways, to be a friend of an earth whose sheer physical
splendour still regularly takes my breath away. Our newspapers, and
there are many of them, go for recycling. Glass goes to the local bottle
bank. Aluminium cans to a charity collector.
I fret about the profligacy of modern supermarket packaging. I worry
away at the implications of climate change. Yes, I drive a car. But I
never did change models every two years. The current one's got more than
90,000 miles on the clock. I am, like a great many other people,
predisposed to buy many of the messages of green politics. I even voted
green on one occasion.
I'm as appalled as the next person at the French Government's decision
to resume nuclear tests on the Mururoa Atoll. But, having said all that,
I am not a Friend of the Earth. Nor have I signed up for Greenpeace.
Why? Partly it's an old-fashioned belief that journalists owe it to
their readers not to carry any party card. But it's also because I have
become increasingly disenchanted down the years, not only with some of
the tactics adopted by green pressure groups, but also with their
mounting determination, buttressed by some of the most sophisticated PR
in the business, to reduce fiendishly complex issues to banal
simplicities.
The latest example occurred only this week. I came back from Finland
to find, among my mail, a press release from Friends of the Earth
Scotland and an invitation to use it exclusively before the general
release date. The release was based on a letter from Irene Currie,
communications manager at Scottish Nuclear, answering a student inquiry
for a degree project, which, supposedly, blows the gaff on the case for
building the Torness nuclear power station.
In her letter, Ms Currie writes: ''The decision to build Torness was
not based on a need for generating capacity . . . (it) was taken to
support the UK engineering industry through what was obviously going to
be a lean period.'' Friends of the Earth calls this ''an incredible
admission'' and claims it proves the old SSEB knew construction was
unnecessary ''contrary to what it told the public and Parliament at the
time''.
I chose not to run with this unsolicited exclusive, which has since
been given extensive, uncritical coverage elsewhere. Why? Because,
having written extensively on the issue throughout the period in
question, I knew it to be old news -- 15-year-old news, to be precise --
and widely ventilated at the time. I am not in the business of recycling
the far-from-incredible from all those years ago, just to give a
particular lobby group a few more column inches of present-day exposure.
On May 19, 1980, Mr Roy Berridge (chairman) and Mr Donald Miller
(deputy chairman) of the old SSEB were questioned by MPs on the Select
Committee on Energy. One questioner was Michael Ancram. ''Would you
still argue that the need for Torness is the same as in 1974?'' he
quizzed.
Mr Berridge replied as follows: ''The need for Torness in terms of
meeting system demand is not urgent, as it then seemed to be, and our
latest load estimates, indeed, show that if we were to build Torness
only to be sure that we can meet our maximum system demand in Scotland
then we would not need to bring it into service until the early 1990s.''
The SSEB chairman went on to outline two other influences on the
decision. He said, ''We have satisfied ourselves that to build Torness
early is a very attractive economic proposition and, secondly, we do
believe that it is necessary for nuclear plants, albeit a small number,
to be ordered in this country.''
There is no need to read between the lines to see that Mr Berridge was
publicly stating then what Ms Currie said in her letter this May. Going
ahead with Torness and its sister station, Heysham B, when they did was
about keeping the British nuclear engineering industry in business, not
about supplying a power shortage on the grid.
Roy Berridge admitted as much to MPs, in 1980. To allege some
''outrageous con trick'' now, as Friends of the Earth is trying to do,
on the back of the Currie letter, raises serious questions about the
ethics of its own campaigning approach.
Bluntly, it seems to me that the green lobby is increasingly
interested in publicity for publicity's sake and much less interested
than it ought to be in reaching rational and credible solutions to the
many complex environmental challenges facing this earth.
Swashbuckling pyrotechnics on the high seas, with a captive media on
hand to relay every manoeuvre to a watching world, may have stopped
Brent Spar being sunk in the Atlantic. They may even have bested the
multinational might of Shell, in winning public sympathy for a cause.
But, to its credit, Greenpeace has since admitted that its analysis of
the contents of that structure was deeply flawed. And there's been a
deafening silence throughout, from that side of the argument, on
precisely what alternative disposals are available for redundant North
Sea structures which will do less damage to the environment.
Many mistakes have been made in the evolution of the civil nuclear
power industry in Scotland. But there is a strand of anti-nuclear
opinion among greens which is such a fundamental article of faith that
it is resistant to any rational debate.
Along with the proposed exclusive, Friends of the Earth Scotland sent
me its latest briefing paper on nuclear power and climate change. Its
purpose is to bury nuclear power's one green credential -- the fact that
it does not pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as fossil stations
do.
In a week when there are disturbing new reports of a hole the size of
Europe in the ozone layer over the South Pole, the briefing makes
fascinating reading. I recommend, in particular, the attempt to prove
that, even if nuclear power helps reduce CO2 emissions, it is only
sixteenth on a merit list of seventeen alternative measures.
It's a case of knowing the answer before you've asked the question.
And perhaps that helps explain why, as the greens have gained wider
publicity for this cause or that, they have lost much of the political
support they enjoyed just a few years ago.

TOM Farmer was much more guarded than his usual self yesterday when
asked how many car insurance policies Kwik-Fit had sold since the
subsidiary was launched in June, writes ANDREW WILSON.
All he would say was ''thousands'', although adding that the
conversion rate of potential customers was high.
The direct telephone marketing operation, based at Tannochside in
Lanarkshire, contributed nothing in the results for the half-year to the
end of August -- the company is, as usual, the fastest to produce
financial accounts of any in Britain. But then there is the old saw that
good figures are quicker to add up than bad -- and so it has proved.
Pre-tax profits jumped 19% to #18.1m, although at the operating level
the advance was 28% on turnover of 21%, ahead at #182m. The improvement
in margins was helped by the expansion of the brake servicing activites
and also a sharp 45% advance in Benelux.
Proftability has also been helped by a full six-month contribution
from Superdrive and the expansion of fleet business where the 80 mobile
replacement vehicles has proved an excellent marketing tool.
Tyres have also done well, helped by a near-5% price increase in June,
and Mr Farmer is not expecting a similar increase within the next four
weeks.
The insurance activities may not be a major profits contributor for
the next year or so, but they are a major marketing tool helping
increase customer loyalty to a company, which has the third-strongest
brand name recognition in Scotland, reinforced by the new Autosave card.
This Sunday, Kwik-Fit is taking over the brand-new Edinburgh
Conference Centre for 1300 staff and suppliers to become even more
imbued with the company culture.
The half-time dividend has been raised 12% to 1.9p despite a 19% rise
in earnings, because Mr Farmer does not like borrowings with the company
currently cash positive.
At 186p, the shares are selling at 14 times possible earnings with a
likely 3.4% yield -- a rating which owes little to any future approaches
from a possible predator such as Boots.

WHAT are we to do with the institution of marriage? The British are
bored with it; they marry less and divorce more and, if we can believe a
new Guardian/ICM poll on attitudes to fidelity, one in five people have
scratched their seven-year-itch and one in three would if they could,
saying chance would be a fine thing.
There's nothing new about disaffection with monogamy. The dissolution
of matrimonial romance, the cooling of institutionalised ardour have
been exercising writers and wits for centuries. The backwash of euphoria
leaves a tidemark of disappointments on even the happiest union. ''A
year of flames followed by 40 years of ashes,'' is the definition
offered by Lampedusa's ninteenth-century Sicilian prince in his novel
The Leopard.
What is new is the increasingly casual disposal of the ashes, among
which (as Don Fabrizio poignantly recognises) are some warm and highly
sustaining embers. Only the immature expect the fireworks of sexual
passion to maintain their excitement for an adult lifetime, but in the
successful marriage there's a lot to be said for the steadier energy of
peat turfs. Their slow-burning warmth brings comfortable intimacy,
weathered friendship, common goals and shared history, and -- the most
challenging ambition of marriage -- the pooling of values which shape
the future of the union's children and, by extension, the future of
society.
There is really no such thing as a secular marriage. The believers
have got it right even for non-believers, even if a spiritual spin
disguises the other imperatives of matrimony. What is its purpose if not
to have children? Even at the institution's most cynical -- in the great
power-broking dynasties of Europe, in the trading of brides in Asia --
children are the most essential part of the equation; otherwise today's
freewheeling Western lovers and yesterday's nuptial empire-builders
would have found a very different kind of contract with which to seal
their deals.
Marriage, by historical definition, is about family life. Even couples
who can't have children or, more mysteriously, choose not to have
children (where is the value in monogamy for its own sake?) usually find
that the institution inexorably brings duties and responsibilities, as
well as supports and celebrations, which they didn't have when they were
single. If nothing else, they become the next of kin to someone outside
their own family group.
The bottom line, as the accountants say, is that the family unit is a
small-scale mechanism for investing in the social and economic future of
the tribe. So far -- the day may come -- we have not been able to
replace stable, loving family life with anything which more effectively
nurtures and protects children -- the gilt-edged bonds of the human
futures market. But, being body and soul rather than digitally
electronic, we've turned the family into something much more
aspirational and a lot messier than the average investment portfolio.
We've made it the receptacle of our most powerful emotions and the
motor of our most cherished value systems, and increasingly the two
collide. Today's marriage partners who become today's parents find it
harder and harder to lead by example. They try to teach the same old
virtues -- kindness, honesty, loyalty, endurance, ''doing unto others as
you would be done by'' -- but in their own emotional lives they behave
like frustrated toddlers; looking for new playmates when they're bored,
punishing the people they love when they're miserable.
Kindness becomes intolerance, honesty deceit, loyalty betrayal, and
endurance a patriarchal plot or a feminist trap. The Conservatives and
their alter ego, New Labour, properly worry about ''the decline in
traditional values'' and the network of stress fractures in family life,
but their efforts to put things right are at best rhetorical and at
worst risible.
Tax breaks for faithful couples? Conservative women activists have
correctly identified the family as an economic unit, but love won't fly
back through the window when a 10-year fidelity bonus comes through the
door. There may be the odd couple who marry, don't marry, stay married,
or separate to save 5p in the pound on their tax burden, but fiscal
tinkering with the institution is like sticking plaster on a jugular
haemorrhage.
If there's money to spare it would be better spent on some
revolutionary reappraisal of our expectations of marriage, and some
tough teaching on the responsibilities of family life. There is no
longer any reason why wedlock and parenting should start at an age when
most people, by virtue of their youth and energy, feel restless rather
than settled; crave the hurly-burly of the chaise longue rather than the
deep contentment of the double bed, and still hope the phone rings on
Saturday nights. We're living longer and longer, we can be parents later
and later. Perhaps it IS unrealistic for us to expect people to stick
together for 50 years when they've chosen each other in the raw,
unformed personalities of their post-adolescence.
Why do they do it? Ask most people and they will say they are in love.
It's not to be sniffed at, the power of romantic love -- the closest
most people come to a sustained peak experience -- but when you're young
it's much too easily confused with lust, infatuation, and other
ephemeral emotions. At the best of times being in love is a
free-falling, aberrational condition which needs the ballast of other
compatabilities to anchor the relationship.
It's my personal belief that precipitate marriages often happen
because couples become infected by the commercial virus of the wedding
industry, which grows ever more absurd, extravagant, and invasive. The
unquenchable spirit of optimism in any wedding ceremony, secular or
religious, is always moving. Marriage is a rite de passage which
deserves celebration -- but six bridesmaids, a churchful of flowers and
favours, and a pair of greys with a landau?
Once you've launched the countdown to that kind of enterprise it's
hard to have second thoughts; and it's even harder to look beyond the
white lace and hired kilt to the years of demanding emotional graft
which lie ahead.

THE August decline in official retail sales seemed to generate more
heat yesterday than the increase in the retail price index, prompting a
chorus of calls for a cut in interest rates to stop the economic
recovery from stalling.
However, these mostly came from sectors of the retail industry and
inevitably politicans, though the Institute of Directors warns that
should poor economic figures continue, there could be a case for a
reduction.
Financial markets were more sanguine about the figures which, while
wrongfooting them to some extent, at least so far as High Street sales
were concerned, were influenced in part by an exceptional factor -- the
abnormally hot weather.
Certainly the Chancellor will require more compelling evidence than
one month's experience in isolation that consumer spending has finally
crumbled and that the recovery, which has mostly been export-led anyway,
is in real danger.
The rise in the headline RPI from 3.5% to 3.6% was largely expected,
but underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments,
also rose from 2.8% to 2.9%. However, this appears mostly to have
reflected a weather-related upsurge in seasonal food prices.
Elsewhere, consumers remain resistant to price increases, and while
some further deterioration in core inflation may be in prospect, its
extent will be limited by competitive conditions. Data evidence,
overall, still points to an easing of inflationary pressures.
As for the decline in retail sales, this tallies with the CBI
Distributive Trades Survey for August, which also showed a drop.
However, it was regarded as something of a maverick month given the
conditions. Price rises after the ending of the summer sales could also
be a factor, adding to consumer resistance.
Neither of yesterday's data points to a need for any immediate
dramatic action on interest rates either way. What happens over the next
few months in the run-up to the Budget should dictate what, if anything,
needs to be done.
Tunnel trauma
ONE thing is certain -- Eurotunnel will not go bust despite the debts
which will approach #9bn by March 1997 unless there is a drastic
financial restructuring agreed over the next few months.
There is no merit in the banks pulling the plug as they would be left
with nothing but a heap of scrap metal and the potential for developing
the biggest mushroom farm in the world.
Happily for the tax-payer, governments are not allowed to come to its
rescue under the Channel Tunnel Act of 1987 but indirectly there could
be some action taken by reducing the duty-free concessions now enjoyed
by ferry passengers and which are said to benefit the operators by
around #100m a year.
Co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton has frequently and stridently railed
against what he considers an unfair advantage enjoyed by P&amp;O and Stena
as the two dominant ferry companies.
But he does seem to have been a little wet behind the ears when he
said that revenues were below what had been hoped because of the price
war started by the ferry companies. After all, he could not really have
expected them to remain at anchor and allow business to flow away to
Eurotunnel.
But to be fair, the ferocity of competition has been greater than
expected and is likely to intensify even more once the Stena twin-hulled
superferry begins service in about a year's time.
Also there is some a glint of light in that revenue is sufficient to
cover operating costs even if the near-#2m-a-day interest will now be
rolled up under the 18 month moratorium agreement.
The banks face the unenviable choice of swapping debt for equity to
reduce the long term interest burden while Eurotunnel is arguing the
2[1/2]% over Libor rate charged, almost 9[1/4]% is too high, and should
be reduced.
Shareholders who have been battered over the years will be extremely
reluctant to agree to any significant dilution through a debt into
equity deal with even the May 1994 rights issue price of 265p now
looking silly. But back in the heady days before the first sod was
turned there were warnings that it would be a high risk invetment where
normal criteria did not apply and so it remains.
The saving grace is that it was not public sector financed.
On the up
IN the past BAe has sadly let down its shareholders with every corner
supposedly turned seeming to produce a fresh disaster though the company
could argue that it had on occasions been unlucky rather than remiss.
But signs are that a new maturity has entered into the company's
thinking.
Its decision, for example, to concede VSEL to GEC was clearly a
sensible one. As analysts have pointed out, attempting to top the #21.50
offer by its rival would have resulted in earnings dilution and possibly
risked squandering a growing reputation for financial prudence.
This is something the board has been building on and the company has
now moved from just surviving to an earnings recovery situation. The
concentration on the now profitable Airbus operation and the highly
rewarding Defence business with its substantial order book provide a
sound cushion. And BAe is sensibly intent upon creating strong
international alliances.
It has been determined to get rid of its loss makers such as the
corporate jet business, Sace Systems and Ballast Nedam. The disposal of
Rover and the 1994 rights issue have helped to improve the balance sheet
and the half year results show considerable progress in rebuilding
dividend cover and interest cover.
Much of the profit advance may be due to reducing costs and ditching
lossmakers rather than improving markets as the chief executive has
indicated. But this does provide a sounder platform for the right kind
of expansion expansion when markets look up.

TODAY'S sermon is in black and white. It concerns a black and white
kitten, a black and white exegesis, and a black heart and a white
knight. First, to the black and white theory and theocracy: that of the
Western Isles. Did I not overhear a Radio Scotland wireless programme
the other day about why Sabbath sailings should never be permitted from
the town of Stornoway and the islands in general in which this Golgotha
resides?
There was a minister who was giving his Sabbatarianism the sort of
airing upon the Scottish listener which he doubtless does with impunity
upon his congregation. He does not want, or permit, Sunday sailings,
regardless, he maintains, of whether or not you are Christian or Muslim
or Jewish or a total unbeliever because it doesn't matter what anybody
thinks: according to him, everybody has to make Sunday as miserable as
he wants it to be because that is what he wants. He says that it is
God's law and that is why we have to do what he, and He, says.
But there is no God says I. And so God's law is spurious, specious,
and there is no amount of certain knowledge of the existence of this
charade of a philosophy which is going to persuade me that I should be
jumping to somebody else's gaudy crackerjack of a religion.
Jews -- who have their shabbat on a Saturday -- aren't jouking about
my country telling me not to watch football on their day of rest, or
even play it, if I could. Not even on any day of the week do they
preclude little children playing. The fundamentalists of one of the most
boring little towns in Europe, that is to say, Stornoway in Lewis,
actually have a wee man going round what play parks as exist padlocking
the swings at 8 o'clock on a Saturday night just so that the shrieks of
merry children cannot sully the Lord's day. Even if it is not your lord
at that. If I had my way we would be chaining up the Sabbatarians, and
all week at that.
I have friends from Lewis, including two young girls who are down in
Glasgow at college, and bloody glad they are to be here, away from the
nonsense of ministers and their bleak vision of religion. You think it's
bad in Lewis -- you should try out Harris. That is where a columnar
colleague once lived, extolling the virtues of the ''unadorned''
churches and the lack of musical instruments. Where the colleague lived
and wrote but recently that all his friends were Highland and
Presbyterian, because they ''shared a common culture''.
I've never asked my friends what religion they were really, and as for
girl friends, if they are lovely and nice I'll be whatever religion is
necessary to enter . . . whatever Kingdom of Heaven they want to me to
be in.
And now we come to the black heart. Three days ago I am entering a
hackney cab, late at night, just so that I can possibly get to the pub
in time for a nightcap, and am assaulted by a fundamentalist Protestant
and Orange chap. He physically assaulted me in the street and the cabbie
has agreed to be a witness and the police have been informed because I
have had enough of this loop over the years, because he is entitled to
his opinion and I am not and must be struck in the street. His is God's
law. Wait till you see the State's: I hope he gets the jail. He was the
Black heart, and no attempt at any sort of eclaircissement of his act
will suffice.
And now for the white knight and the black and white cat. A few days
ago I found a young kitten, a well-kept little thing perhaps about six
months old, outside my flat early in the evening. When I returned from
work after midnight the little cat was still there, mewing piteously. I
took it up to my house and fed it and then delivered it into the hands
of my sister-in-law who has cats beause I can hardly look after myself,
let alone a cat.
It is now in Cardonald cat home, where the owner might want to find it
if the owner reads this column. The little creature was holding out
underneath cars on a busy road on the South Side where it was unlikely
to survive the night what with all the cars and ambulances and such. So
I took it into my house and then into my sister-in-laws, and then my
nephew looked after it.
Not a one of us were Christians, Prods, Tims, Jews, or religious at
all. Just simple Samaritans, unencumbered by the dismal dogma which sees
rectitude in knowing that only you are right because you say you are,
backed up by nonsense about the scriptures written by men scratching at
their primitive superstitions. It was myself who looked after the wee
cat. Black and white all the way through. I am the unbeliever. I am the
white knight.

COATS Viyella offset a poor first-half performance in Britain and the
United States with gains elsewhere in the world -- especially in Brazil
and Turkey.
The UK's largest textiles group was also strengthened by the sale of
its carpets, yarns and fabrics businesses for #100m, and its purchase of
the US high-tech plastics engineering firm BACE for #66m in February.
''The result is a more focused group, with management better able to
concentrate on actively exploiting opportunities for organic growth in
all our divisions,'' said chairman Sir David Alliance.
Despite this upbeat assessment, the share price fell 3p to 194p after
Coats revealed that finance director Jeff Phillips had resigned after
only six months in the job. ''The company is actively searching for a
replacement,'' a spokesman said, declining to comment further.
Coats' continuing business showed a 6% increase in sales and a 12%
improvement in operating profits during the six months to June 30. But
the less profitable subsidiaries which were sold off during the period
exerted a drag on its overall results.
Pre-tax profits rose only 2% to #70.8m, while turnover declined 1% to
#1199.1m. Earnings per share increased 5% to 6.6p and the interim
dividend -- paid in the form of a foreign income dividend -- was raised
6% in conventional dividend terms to 3.70p.
City analysts said the results were in line with expectations and
Chris Burbridge, of UBS Securities, forecast full-year profits of #165m.
Coats said full-year results would partly depend on UK sales picking
up during the crucial pre-Christmas period, following depressed activity
during the recent heatwave.
Demand in the United States remains lower than expected, but the
company's performance should improve as a result of the BACE purchase,
it added.
The outlook elsewhere is mixed. Business in India is still suffering
from a steep rise in cotton prices following the liberalisation of the
economy and higher taxes. But Brazil is forging ahead, despite a recent
slowdown in economic growth.
Along with the first-half results, Coats announced two boardroom
changes and the acquisition of Technicor, a zinc diecast engineering
company based in Northampton, for an undisclosed sum -- understood to be
around #6m.
Coats said Mr Phillips had resigned as finance director ''to pursue
other interests'' after joining the company from Mercury Communications
in March.
Peter White, the head of Coats' poorly performing home furnishings
division, would leave the board at the end of September, it added.
In their place, Fiona Harrison, the head of the fashion retail
division, and David Speirs, the chief executive of Coats' precision
engineering subsidiary Dynacast International, will become directors
with immediate effect.

IT IS instructive to learn how our public bodies are spending the
taxpayers' money. Seona Reid, director of the Scottish Arts Council, and
her senior management team have just spent #1400 a skull on attending a
development programme.
The course is run by a company called =mc. (What do you mean
pretentious?) For those of us who are not Einstein, it is also called
The Management Centre.
The =mc people offer the opportunity to senior managers in charities,
local government, and quangos ''to work on the complex challenges you
face in dealing with the wide range of stakeholders you have including
the public, funders, staff, and board members. It looks at a range of
key areas such as sharing personal vision, adopting a leadership style,
and analysing corporate culture.''
Ms Reid obviously found it all worth while. She is quoted by =mc as
saying: ''As the CEO of a very diverse organisation, I've found =mc
training consistently stretching and demanding, and enormously useful in
developing my personal style.''
As taxpayers you will be delighted to know that something in the
region of #10,000 of your money has been used to acquaint Ms Reid and
her team with such techniques as 360 degrees feedback using the
well-respected Myers Briggs Type Inventory and Kouzes's and Peters's
five leadership practices.
Please form an orderly queue all of you who think these courses are a
lot of expensive bullshit and provide an excuse for the Scottish Arts
Council to say sorry we have spent all the money and the Pumpherston
Festival cannot have a grant.
Consumer choice
A FOOD company has had to advertise in the public prints that one of
its products is to be recalled. The message reads: ''There is a possible
risk of small pieces of the plastic packaging which supports the gateau
breaking off and being found in the product.''
In other words, you could fair choke on the cake. The warning was
issued by a company whose name has an ominous ring. It is called Death
by Chocolate.
Title bout
FOR those of you whose pater did not leave you a title or who have yet
to feature in the honours list, may we suggest that you get in touch
with Lord Doctor B J in den Bosch of Groesbeek, Holland.
We are in receit of a circular from the above Lord Doctor offering a
whole variety of titles, including that of Laird of the Camster Burn
Estate in Caithness, Scotland. To qualify you need to send your name, a
passport photo, and $300. As well as the title you get a map showing the
location of your 18"X10" piece of the estate.
Other titles on offer from the good Lord Doctor include the post of
deputy member or senator of the International Parliament for Safety and
Peace in Italy. Yes, that International Parliament for Safety and Peace
in Italy. It costs $140 but you get a diplomatic passport as part of the
deal.
Or you could sign up as a knight or dame of the Lofsensic Ursinius
Order, a member of the Order of the Holy Grail, or a Master or Mistress
of the Association of the Universe. We think that for the last-named you
have to provide your own spaceship.
* Or you could be Santa.
The organisers of the first official Santa Claus World Championships
at Ilulissat in Greenland next month are looking for a British
competitor. ''We are looking for a someone who is proud to represent
their country and his department store. He or she must be a 100% bona
fide working Santa,'' says Peter Williams, managing director of the
Santa Claus Greenland Foundation.
Mr Williams should know. He is the man in charge of opening the
125,000 letters written to Santa each Christmas. Our Man Very Near the
North Pole tells us that the Santa competition is quite sporting in
nature and involves disciplines such as climbing up and down chimneys,
decorating trees, and going ho-ho-ho a lot.
There will also be a Santa School where Father Christmases will swap
elements of expertise.
Mr Williams adds: ''We are looking for a Santa from Britain who is
portly but not fat, genial with a high self-esteem and sense of humour
who is also environmentally friendly. He or she must like children and
reindeer and not be afraid of heavy lifting.'' A Santa cape and thermal
boots will be provided but you must have your own beard. The telephone
number for aspiring Santas is 00 299 22 426.
And don't say the Herald Diary doesn't give you a chance to get on in
life.
Questionable
tactics
CONTINUING the saga of nefarious pub quiz doings, we relate the sorry
story of David L Donaldson, of Glasgow, who found himself in an isolated
hotel in Inchnadamph, north of Ullapool. The three guests, Mr Donaldson,
his wife, and an English chap, agreed to participate in the quiz to be
held that night.
After dinner, The Lowlanders, as they had rashly called themselves,
were astonished to discover that the bar which had earlier been deserted
was by now packed to the rafters with people who had travelled from far
and near to observe this local Big Event. To the horror of the landlord
and locals, the Lowlanders took a commanding lead.
Various attempts to foil this were employed, such as spreading the
answers around in the Gaelic, but eventually a deadlock emerged between
the intruders and the local champions, forcing a head-to-head round. The
subject of the questions was ''local knowledge''.
The Lowlanders were, unsurprisingly, scuppered by questions such as
''Hoo minny kye did Kirsty McCallum sell at Perth Auction?'' and ''Which
ram tupped Jock McFarlane's ewes?'' The Lowlanders conceded defeat and
local honour was restored.
A consolation prize of the book How to Win Any Pub Quiz goes to Mr
Donaldson so that he may do better next time.

Margaret Vaughan reports on the confusing debate over feeding the
world
FAMINE is back in the news. It's not actually happening. No affecting
pictures of dazed refugees with limbs like stick-insects huddled under
blankets, hugging mute babies with flies and imminent death in their big
eyes. Not yet. But it will.
While we're waiting, we can chew over the bones of the debate about
what to do about it, why we don't do anything about it until it happens,
and whether anything can be done about it anyway, viz:
Doomed, doomed, we're-all-doomed, wail the post-Multhusian prophets of
catastrophe. Och that's taking it a bit far, tut the hands-on aid-relief
industry. In chimes the all-bunkum-anyway lobby to slap the alarmists
round the head with statistics showing there's ample capacity to feed
the world if only all those beastly dictators would stop creating
political mayhem and crises and feed their stricken people.
How to know whom to believe? The dominant view that famine and
malnutrition will ultimately be defeated by more efficient farming
systems is downright complacent, wrong, and dangerous, says Professor
Ian Carruthers, of London University.
He weighed in yesterday, in a paper for the British Association
meeting, with a warning that worrying trends, if ignored, could lead to
a food crisis in the developing world in the next century: ''I doubt the
capacity of agriculture in poorer countries to achieve production growth
rates to match those achieved in the past 25 years. Farmers will not be
able to react adequately to forthcoming higher food prices and reach the
needed levels of production.''
And he cautioned that world grain stocks were at their lowest for many
years. It would only take one weather failure to create serious
problems: ''It would just need the failure of the Indian monsoon for the
whole picture to be shaken.''
Depressing. Especially since it confirms the messages given in reports
from the conference on global food trends until 2020, held in Washington
in June. There the Worldwatch Institute, which has been vainly
predicting global famine for years, argued too that world grain stocks
are lower than at any time since the early seventies. China, it warned,
is about to start importing vast amounts of grain, as Russia did in the
seventies. Consequently we're all going to starve.
Scary. But then a forthcoming study from the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organisation countered the argument, saying Worldwatch had miscalculated
China's productive capacity.
And, in Washington, the International Food Policy Research Institute
argues that the world is perfectly capable of feeding 12 billion people
100 years from now. The world population doubled between 1950 and 1988,
yet food supply kept pace with demand. It seems the doomsters failed to
predict the green revolution of agricultural productivity, as scientists
invented strains of high-yielding cereals. In Asia, wheat yields rose
fivefold between 1961 and 1991.
Yes it is all very worrying, says Dr Gordon Dickinson, a specialist in
sustainable resource management at Glasgow University: but don't forget,
he counsels, that scientists often get it wrong. True: for centuries
wise men predicted global famine. First there was Thomas Malthus, a
clergyman and self-styled population expert, who argued two centuries
ago that population growth would outstrip food supplies. Then in 1968
there was Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish Nobel Laureate who declared India
would have trouble feeding more than 500 million people. Or the sixties
bestseller Famine 1975!
Dr Dickinson, however, believes halting population growth remains the
key and believes Professor Carruthers is right to be alarmed about our
ability to go on producing food to fill more and more hungry bellies.
Every year the numbers in developing countries expand by almost 90
million. UN estimates suggest that by 2020, the world population will
have grown to exceed eight billion, that's almost 45% more than today.
It's hip, nowadays, to mock, as the right-wing US satirist P J
O'Rourke does, to devastating effect, all efforts by the international
community to meddle in the affairs of poverty-ridden developing
countries. This line falls into the blame-the-lot-on-bad-government
camp: ''. . . Sudan and Ethiopia didn't mind if certain troublesome
portions of their populations starved to death while Botswana and
Zimbabwe did mind,'' he writes. O'Rourke spent a grim week or two in
Somalia when thousands were dying of starvation, travelling through a
country full of starving people and finding fields full of food, markets
full of food, and aid from around the world in the hands of government
profiteers.
Then there are the aid agencies. It's cool, too, to adopt a cynical
tone when discussing their role in the developing countries: to point to
the mandatory accessories of modems and mobile phones and
chauffeur-driven Japanese 4x4s whizzing aid executives to crisis
management meetings in Kampala, Kigali, Addis Ababa, Nairobi. But they
are famine's frontline troops.
And, as Oxfam's Ruth Mayne points out, the real issue is not the risk
of global food shortage in the next century. There is enough food to
feed the world. The trouble is that starvation exists in specific areas,
in poor countries.
On UN estimates there are more than 700 million people in poor
countries who are chronically undernourished. In 1993, 12 million
children under the age of five died of malnutrition or related
illnesses. They were victims, then, not of food scarcity but of poverty.
Yes, it's confusing. So we'll probably just leave it until the next
batch of pictures of starvation and death arrive to persuade us
otherwise. Because we always do.

Historian Dr Jim Hunter, carrying on the work of John McEwen, is
fighting to make landlords answerable to the Scottish people, as
Highland Correspondent David Ross describes
NEXT Friday morning in Dingwall, writer and historian Dr Jim Hunter
will deliver the second McEwen Memorial Lecture entitled ''Towards a
land reform agenda for a Scots Parliament''. The seminar, organised by
Rural Forum and the Friends of John McEwen, takes place on the third
anniversary of the death of John McEwen in Blairgowrie, just two days
short of his 105th birthday. This remarkable man had spent his working
life as a forester, but in 1977 at the age of 90 he published Who Owns
Scotland, a painstaking work, effectively a land ownership register for
Scotland in the twentieth century, something Governments have always
found beyond them.
The previous year Jim Hunter had published the Making of the Crofting
Community, which in an academically reputable way challenged those
established historians who always seemed at pains to understate the
scale, brutality, and significance of the Highland Clearances. Both
books were enormously influential contributions to the modern Highland
radical tradition that was emerging in that decade, sustained by the
likes of the West Highland Free Press (founded Skye, 1972) which had
done so much to ensure land ownership was never far from the political
agenda.
John McEwen always held that a land register was a prerequisite for
land reform. His calculations pointed to 500 individuals owning half of
Scotland with the top 100 landowning families accounting for more that
25% of the country. As is the way with land ownership, some of his
figures were out of date by the time Polygon published his book in
October 1977. It didn't matter. His work still gave statistical
definition to the landlords' continuing grip on modern Scotland.
This had followed on from earlier work. In 1971 he and other members
of the Perth and Kinross Fabian Society produced a booklet, ''The
Acreocracy of Perthshire'', to try to push the issue of land ownership
up the Labour Party's agenda for its Scottish Conference in Perth that
year. He later treated the Crofting Counties in a similar manner, the
fruits of which were published in the Red Paper on Scotland in 1975.
He was clear as to his purpose: ''My objective is to see the
stranglehold of our mainly absentee landlordism destroyed, to see
cap-in-hand servile flunkeyism replaced by dedicated workers reclaiming
our desert lands.'' There were many in the Scotland of the 1970s, as
now, who would applaud his goal. And if there was an impatience in his
voice it was perhaps understandable. After all in the year he was born
the Marquess of Salisbury was Prime Minister, Gladstone's third
Government having fallen the previous year after the Liberal Party split
over Irish Home Rule. His roots were the radical Liberalism of the time.
The son of an estate worker, he was born in Perthshire at Fortingall.
In his boyhood he moved to Argyll and the Strathlachlan Estate where
he was to learn about his place and that of his social superiors, not
least as he beat their year's mud from all the carpets in the estate
house. Perhaps an early indication to him of the lunatic inefficiency of
a social etiquette which marked seigneurial Britain.
John McEwen's working life was to be largely spent in forestry here
and in Ireland. First for the Forestry Commission and subsequently for
himself as a forestry consultant. This effectively meant he was advising
the very lairdocracy he so despised.
But his was a higher concern than just the world's sore division. In
1977 he told Brian Wilson of the West Highland Free Press that he was
well aware of the irony of his work but insisted ''I think it is the
right thing to do, for it is crucial that the land should be
productive''. That was the real sin of landlordism to John McEwen, the
woeful waste of its potential, but he was sure that things would change:
''One day the land will be publicly owned because common sense says that
it must be so. We cannot leave our greatest resource in the hands of
irresponsible individuals.''
Common sense has yet to prevail, but on Friday Jim Hunter will make a
start with his land agenda for a Scots parliament. Those who knew of
John McEwen will remember, of course, that one of the last things he
wanted to see was a Scots parliament. He was firmly on the ''No'' side
in the devolution debate of the 1970s, but he would have been all in
favour of an agenda for land reform.
But the agenda that Dr Hunter will propose will not be the wholesale
land nationalisation that John McEwen wanted in the 1970s, and will even
involve rolling back the frontiers of the state, rather than forward. It
will be a reasonable agenda which could be delivered by the year 2000
without too much strain on the public purse. The estate houses will not
be boarded up.
This may serve to depress Scotland's ranks of battle-weary land
campaigners, and anger others who hold John McEwen's memory dear. But it
shouldn't. Hunter's agenda will be based on local communities, an idea
which McEwen was increasingly attracted to by the end of his life. It is
an agenda which would strike at the very heart of our legal framework
which for so long has defended landlordism. It would make the landlords
answerable to the Scottish people.
Jim Hunter is serious in this and he will demand a Scots parliament
take the issue seriously as well: ''A parliament which is prepared to
act decisively on land will be a parliament which will thus demonstrate
its willingess to alter Scotland fundamentally. A parliament which,
conversely, shies away from land reform will be a parliament which, by
its dodging of this most symbolic issue, will make it clear that, though
we shall again have our own legislature, great consequences will not
follow from that fact.''

MARGARET HUGHES and company go in
search of the perfect cappuccino
BAD cappuccino is often a lot easier to find than good cappuccino and
the reasons for this are numerous. However, probably the biggest barrier
in the way of being served a really good cappuccino is the person who is
making it.
Occasionally the coffee can be blamed -- especially if it is made
using stale coffee beans which have lain around being exposed to the air
for too long. But more often than not, the quantity of beans is badly
judged and you end up with a double espresso topped with frothy milk or
something that is too weak in flavour.
The milk also has to be just right -- not too hot, that is not
boiling, or it will taste burnt, which it is. Watching your cappuccino
being made is a good way to judge how it will taste -- if cold milk is
used and the nozzle of the anaesthetically pleasing, complicated-looking
coffee machine, is not rammed to the bottom of the jug of milk, but sits
just on top of the milk it should froth to the right consistency. The
quantity of milk should reach about twice its volume before being poured
over the rich, dark espresso, and sprinkled with chocolate.
Glasgow is fortunate to have so many cafes selling cappuccino -- but
how authentic are these offerings? Three coffee aficionados, Rosina
Ferrier, of Italian heritage and therefore well-versed in what makes
good cappuccino; Virginia Braid, a student who formerly worked as a
marketing manager for a coffee company; and Helen Kennedy, who relishes
the caffeine ''kick'', toured a selection of venues looking for the
perfect cappuccino.
COSTA COFFEE BOUTIQUE
Glasgow Central Station, 95p
* VIRGINIA was full of praise, particularly because they served
decaffeinated: ''This is good, it has a rich flavour. You can tell that
real coffee beans have been used and not instant decaff with froth
added!''
Rosina was slightly less enthusiastic: ''The coffee tastes a bit too
weak, there is not much froth and the aftertaste is very bland.''
Helen enjoyed it: ''However, it probably is a little too milky, but it
is just the right temperature to enjoy.''
Mark out of ten: 8
CAFFEE ROBERTA
Gordon Street, Glasgow, 95p
* ROSINA preferred the stronger flavour of this cappuccino: ''This is
the sort of coffee that has more of a kick! The froth is just right and
the taste is much richer.''
Helen disliked it initially: ''It was a little too strong for me, but
left a very pleasant taste in my mouth. The more I drank the more I
liked it!''
Virginia again asked for decaffeinated: ''This has a great coffee
flavour, I sampled the regular cappuccino and the flavour is just as
good. It also looks darker than any of the others and somehow more
authentic.''
Mark out of ten: 9
FRATELLI SARTI
Wellington Street, Glasgow, 95p
* HELEN is a fan of this Italian delicatessen cum cafe/restaurant:
''This is a disappointment. It is far too hot to drink, the milk tastes
burnt which has affected the flavour of the coffee.''
Virginia agreed: ''There is too much froth, it is too hot, but the
flavour of the coffee is good.''
Rosina was equally disappointed: ''It tastes more like a white coffee
than a cappuccino.''
Marks out of ten: 6
CAFE GANDOLFI
Albion Street, Glasgow, #1.10 for regular and double strength
cappuccino
* ROSINA decided to go for the double strength, which is sold in a
smaller cup: ''It is just the right size, and has a reasonable coffee
flavour, but is not strong as I expected.''
Virginia again requested decaffeinated: ''The froth is thick but the
coffee is watery and has a weak taste, I wonder if it is made with real
bean?'' Subsequent investigation proved that it was.
Helen felt there was too much froth: ''The serving is just too much,
the cup is very large and when you get through the froth the coffee is
weak. Although the chocolate sprinkles are preferable to chocolate
powder.''
Marks out of ten: 5
ANDRONICA'S
Princes Square, Buchanan Street, Glasgow, #1.10
* HELEN complained less about the size of the cup: ''There is enough
here to be enjoyable, it has the right amount of froth, but is maybe a
little too strong.''
Rosina disagreed: ''The coffee flavour is a little weak for me.''
Virginia felt it had a good coffee aroma and taste: ''It is not bitter
or weak, it is at just the right temperature to enjoy and there is the
right amount of froth.''
Marks out of ten: 7.

When there's danger of biting off more than can be chewed, Jennifer
Cunningham finds that retailers are quick to recall goods
THE chocoholic tendency of the nation was well and truly registered
this week by the sudden interest in quality control in bakeries and the
system for recalling faulty goods. The possibility that bits of metal
could have been incorporated into the mix of certain chocolate cakes
sold by Marks &amp; Spencer and that pieces of plastic could have found
their way into packs of chocolate biscuits sold by Sainsbury is one of
those unlikely coincidences which suddenly concentrates the attention.
No-one has yet reported plastic in the biscuits or metal in the cakes,
but the decision by two of the country's major retailers to recall and
offer refunds for the chocolate goodies has focused on the system of
protecting consumers from faulty goods to reveal that it still operates
on a largely voluntary basis despite continual refinement of the law on
the safety of goods.
Under the 1987 Consumer Protection Act, the Department of Trade can
issue a prohibition notice preventing faulty goods from being sold and
can require the manufacturer to recall them and to issue a warning
notice. What happens increasingly according to Andy Moynihan, trading
standards officer in Strathclyde, is that manufacturers and retailers
step in to short-circuit the damage to their public image by issuing
voluntary notices.
''There has been an exponential growth in voluntary notices and
recalls since 1987, but I am increasingly concerned that they do not
penetrate the public consciousness. This latest one is the only one
people know about because it is mildly humorous: death by chocolate
could be a reality.''
He suggests a nationally-agreed code which would require all recall
notices to be notified to a nationwide body such as the Institute of
Trading Standards Administration so that a list could be available for
consultation in their offices or public libraries. ''People just do not
see these notices because there is no consistency about where they are
displayed,'' he said.
Much of the recent thinking on recall procedures stems from criticism
of the recall of a Candy washing machine several years ago. The company
warned in the notice that the machine was likely to overheat, but failed
to state explicitly that it could catch fire and someone later died as a
result of such a fire.
Both Sainsbury and Marks &amp; Spencer made a virtue out of necessity this
week, saying that acting swiftly to recall the products as soon as they
were aware of a potential fault protected their reputations.
Della Critchley of Marks &amp; Spencer said that swift recall reinforced
their customers' faith in their reputation for quality. ''In this sort
of situation, we take the view that the only way to be sure is to recall
all the products which went through that production line and, of course,
we can now track them down by serial numbers.
''We are so concerned about safety that even though there is a metal
detector on that production line we would never take the risk of even a
potential hazard. We recalled a particular dungaree for toddlers last
month because we were alerted that a metal button could come apart. In
fact, very few of the thousands of garments were affected, but even one
would be too many,'' she said.
Sainsbury spokesman David Cox took a similar line. ''We don't view it
as bad publicity because in the past year there have been only three or
four recalls despite having 20,000 lines. Measuring the effectiveness of
recall notices is an inexact science because with products of fairly low
value we think many people will simply throw them away rather than come
back to the shop for a refund, although some do as a matter of
principle,'' he said.
A potentially more serious recall was a plug-in air freshener which
collapsed to leave bare wires exposed if pulled out of the socket in the
wrong way. Of the 80,000 the company had sold, 30,000 were returned, but
they believe most of the rest were simply thrown away.
Sainsbury say they follow the voluntery code of practice drawn up by
the British Retail Consortium which represents 90% of retailers in the
UK, both the major High Street chains, and small businesses represented
by local chambers of commerce.
The guidelines offer advice on issues such as whether the manufacturer
or the retailer should recall particular goods (that usually depends on
whether they are widely available through different outlets), what the
arrangements to return goods should be and how notices should be worded.
It was drawn up about 18 months ago when retailers felt the need for a
common policy in response to a European directive on product safety
regulations which came into effect a year ago.
It had the effect of extending a general safety requirement to all
goods, where previously only certain categories such as food, products
for children, and electrical goods had to meet certain safety standards.
''Manufacturers now have to consider safety even when their product is
misused and there are now far more warning notices attached to things
like electrical appliances, such as not to touch moving brushes on a
vacuum cleaner, for example,'' said Ian Hiller of Strathclyde region's
trading standards department. He believes most companies now issue
recall notices as a defensive measure should they be prosecuted, because
they will be able to say they made efforts to warn the public and to
have faulty goods returned.
A continuing increase in the number of recall notices is likely for
precisely those reasons, according to Tim Watt of the Consumers'
Association, but he would also like to see the codes of practice more
closely scrutinised by the Department of Trade following the example of
the car industry whose code has been endorsed by the Department of
Transport.

CROWN post offices, including 60 in Strathclyde, have been targetted
for further 24-hour strikes called for a week today by the
Communications Workers' Union.
As before, the stoppages, planned for 20 regions -- including Glasgow,
London, Liverpool and Northern Ireland -- have been called in protest at
what the CWU sees as ''back-door privatisation''.
PO Counters has closed more than 700 town-centre Crown offices since
1988 with many of them franchised to retail chains including Tesco,
Ryman, Asda, Safeway, and the Co-op.
CWU joint general-secretary Alan Johnson said in Brighton yesterday
that the stoppages were about defending high-quality, town-centre
services.
''We are asking the public not to use Crown POs next Friday to
highlight the madness of a closure programme which is ripping the heart
out of communities across the country.''
A PO spokesman defended the franchising programme which he said was
popular with the public. He stressed that most post offices were
expected to operate as normal next Friday.

A FORMER manager of sheltered accommodation has escaped a jail
sentence after repaying more than #200 he stole from an elderly
resident.
Graham Logue, 31, of Arrol Drive, Heathhall, Dumfries, was sentenced
to 200 hours community service at Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court. Sheriff
James Smith said repaying the money had saved Logue from imprisonment.
Logue admitted stealing #222.45 from Mr Adrian Ricci, who was under
his care and had been admitted to hospital.
Logue was manager of Castle Douglas Supported Accommodation, run by
Dumfries and Galloway Mental Health Association, and had been
responsible for cashing Mr Ricci's invalidity benefit.

GLASGOW Euro MP Bill Miller has put forward proposals which would
force distillers and brewers to print health warnings on bottles and
cans of alcoholic drinks.
He wants the European drinks industry to follow the lead of America
where drinks containers warn of the effects of alcohol on pregnant women
and the dangers of operating machinery or vehicles after drinking.
However, a spokesman for Britain's major alcohol producers said Mr
Miller's concerns were misdirected, and that warnings on labels were not
the most effective way of giving advice.
Dr John Rae, of the Portman Group, commented: ''Mr Miller is quite
right that pregnant mothers do need advice, but surely they would be
better receiving it from the doctor whom they will be attending than
from the side of a bottle or a can which they may not, in any case, see?
''It is quite right to raise awareness about excessive consumption or,
in the case of pregnant women, unsuitable consumption, but 70% of
alcohol is consumed in this country without the consumer seeing the
bottle or the can so it is not an effective way of doing it.''
Dr Rae said the Government was currently reviewing the latest findings
on alcohol and health, and any legislation would be premature before it
published its conclusions.

<TEXT>
PEOPLE are travelling greater distances, faster, and more often by car
within Britain, the latest Department of Transport survey suggests.
The average person travels 6400 miles a year -- 1000 miles more than
10 years ago.
Around 359 hours are spent -- more than 14 days in total -- on
travelling to work, going on holiday, shopping, visiting and taxi-ing
around. More than half of this time (59%) is spent in a car.
The average journey to work -- for all types of transport -- takes 27
minutes, although commuting into central London takes around 57 minutes.
Though the average door-to-door journey speed around the country is
17mph, Londoners only manage 8.7mph across the centre of town, down from
11mph in 1990 and about the same as a horse-drawn carriage in 1912.
Two out of three commuters use a private car to travel to work, and
there is now one car in use for every two adults in the country with
most journeys (82%) made by car.
People also walk far less today than in the 1970s -- the survey shows
people walk around 200 miles a year, a drop of almost 20% on 20 years
ago, and five to 15-year-olds walk 27% less than they did then.
Most people still manage to walk short journeys, with 92% of all
journeys under half a mile and 68% of journeys half-a-mile to a mile
made on foot.
There are also nearly three times as many female car owners than 20
years ago.
The survey was carried out between January 1992 and December 1994, and
10,296 households took part.
Its publication coincides with the launch of a pressure group campaign
aimed at reducing road traffic and the number of people dying early from
increased air pollution.
The campaign involves a national petition backing a Road Traffic
Reduction Bill, which would require local councils to say how they are
reducing car and vehicle movements.
Already 81 MPs from five different parties, including four
Conservatives, have signed an early day motion in support of the Bill.
Launching the petition at Westminster yesterday Mr Charles Secrett,
executive director of Friends of the Earth, said: ''The Bill is a beacon
of hope for millions of people suffering from air pollution,
road-building, noise and all the other symptoms of a car obsessed
transport policy.''
Friends of the Earth and the Green Party hope to convince a back-bench
MP to pilot a Private Member's Bill through Parliament on the issue.

DRUGS squad officers yesterday found around #200,000 worth of cannabis
plants growing at a tenanted farm on the estate of Earl Waldegrave,
older brother of Treasury Secretary William Waldegrave.
Police said the plants were discovered in three barns when officers
executed a search warrant at Rookery Farm, near Chewton Mendip,
Somerset.
A 30-year-old man was arrested and is being questioned.
Police said a ''substantial number'' of cannabis plants were recovered
in a further raid at a house in Milsom Street, Easton, Bristol.
Officers were apparently acting on ''information received'' when they
searched the farm on Earl Waldegrave's 3500 acre estate. The farm is
just over a mile from Chewton House, home of the 54-year-old earl, who
inherited his title in May.
Earlier this month, police told him he would not be prosecuted over
his estranged wife's allegations he threatened to kill her with a knife.
His wife, Lady Mary, a former journalist, had twice called police to
their home, apparently after rows concerning custody of their sons, aged
eight and six.
The earl has admitted they are consulting solicitors over their
marital problems but denied her allegations.

UNIONS yesterday demanded Government intervention to save what remains
of Britain's oil rig and shipbuilding industry.
Without a level playing field, provided by matching subsidies offered
by other governments or ensuring all such financial assistance is ended,
many of the 27,000 ship and rig fabrication jobs could be lost, yard
unions said in Brighton.
Conversely, support channeled through the Offshore Supply Office could
boost existing yards and assist investment in facilities to build the
new generation of floating rig platforms which will increase in demand
as exploration work moves into deeper water.
With orders expected to begin soon for up to six new floating rigs a
year, Britain stands to lose out badly. Floating platforms that require
more shipbuilding as opposed to traditional rig building skills could
offer protection to many of Britain's remaining shipyard workers.
AEEU executive councillor Jimmie Airlie stressed that with a level
playing field no country in the world could compete with the UK
industry, a point taken up by STUC general secretary Campbell Christie.
He pointed out that only last week Kvaerner-Govan landed an order for a
rocker launching vessel against competition from a German yard, but only
after the Government was persuaded to match German state subsidies.
Yesterday, the congress also approved a number of statements on
employment and trade union policy designed to be implemented if Labour
wins the next General Election.
It survived accusations that the TUC general council is pulling its
punches as it seeks not ''to rock the boat'' and harm the chances of a
Labour victory.
A plea by the National Union of Mineworkers' president, Mr Arthur
Scragill, to risk being taken to court by ignoring the present laws was
defeated.
Mr Bill Morris, Transport and General Workers Union leader, introduced
the conclusions of a TUC task group on Rights to Work Representation.
The report calls for new laws to guarantee rights to representation
because ''the era of voluntary industrial relations in Britain has been
buried by employers''.
It proposes that the right to ''a collective voice'' should be
triggered where union members make up 10% or more of a bargaining unit
with the right to be consulted on a range of issues. Where there is a
majority of membership (50% plus one) negotiating rights would be
automatic, but it also wants the same kind of rights for workers who are
not union members.
A composite motion called on an incoming Labour government to
re-examine all relevent legislation to establish the independence of
unions.
The unions have accepted that ballots for industrial action will
remain a legal obligation, with Mr Morris claiming that, in fact, secret
ballots have strengthened the hand of unions.
Congress approved a raft of measures on employment rights, including
protection for all those in work from the day they start.
Mr Ronnie Scot, the firefighters' leader from Paisley, sought the
right of trade unions to organise and the right to strike under the
articles of the International Labour Organisation.

A WARNING that a valuable opportunity will be lost to Aberdeen should
planning permission be refused for a new #65m campus for the Robert
Gordon University was given yesterday.
More than 400 objections have been lodged against the plan to unify
the university's five different locations on a single campus at Garthdee
on the banks of the River Dee.
Yesterday university vice-principal Gavin Ross said it was important
to correct the impression that the student population at Garthdee would
rise from the present 1300 in the Design Faculty based there to 10,000
overnight.
''The relocation will be phased over 20 years,'' he said. The first
phase, which would be completed by 1998 if given approval, is for the
relocation of the Faculty of Management and he said obtaining funding
had been achieved against strong competition from elsewhere in Scotland.
''We have to see this part of the development completed by 1998 or
else funding may be at risk and we are talking about an #11m project.
''What a tragedy if this were to be lost to this part of the world.''
The university is currently located in five areas spread across the
city -- Garthdee, Kepplestone, Hilton, Schoolhill and King Street.
''The future success of the university for the community it serves
depends on us learning to operate yet more economically. One of our
greatest inefficiencies in economic terms lies in the multiplicity of
our estates.
'' We envisage a greater move in the future to cross-disciplinary
courses. This means the interdependence of our faculties will increase,
with students and staff requiring greater access between departments.''
Mr Ross said that because of the Government's planned expansion of
student numbers they had been required to develop sophisticated long
term estates strategies.
''These studies demonstrate conclusively that far and away the best
option for our long term future strategically, economically and
academically, is to develop a single campus focused around one of our
existing sites. Garthdee offers the best opportunity to do this.
''Furthermore the intrinsic quality of the site offers us the
opportunity to create something really special which would promote an
image of the university and the city.
''The only alternative strategy would be to relocate outside the city
and our wish is to remain in Aberdeen.'' One of the major objections to
the scheme has been the increase in traffic in an already congested area
but Mr Ross said that as the plans spanned 20 years it was not easy to
assess the traffic impact.
''Wherever the university is located in Aberdeen, it will generate
traffic. If it continues to be located at various sites it will generate
more traffic within the city than it would at a single site.'' In a bid
to reduce traffic impact the university plans to reduce peak hour
congestion by a number of means including staggering the start time of
lectures and by seeking to establish a close relationship with the
region's plans for a cycle path network.
Mr Ross said public access to the campus and the riverside had been
fundamental to their thinking and the campus would be open to the
community. A riverside park would be created and there would be a public
thoroughfare providing easy access from Garthdee Road to the river.
Later some 200 people attended a public hearing organised by Aberdeen
District Council's planning division into the university campus
proposals. Opposition -- voiced by several speakers -- came from the
Aberdeen Garthdee action group. Solicitor Christopher Smyllie said the
group believed it was not the right site for a campus of more than
12,000 students and staff and urged the planners to refuse the
application ''in the interests of the people of Garthdee and the
integrity of the planning system''.
Planning convener Councillor Maureen Irons allowed Garthdee woman Mrs
Jean Watson of Craigievar Crescent, to be the first lone objector. Mrs
Watson expressed fears that a student campus would result in the area
being littered by dirty needles and condoms.
Businessman Bruce Miller -- not a resident of Garthdee -- but a
''hugely proud Aberdonian'', said there would have been a scream of rage
if the application had been for a campus in the city's Westburn or
Duthie Parks. Mr Miller urged the planners not to allow the loss to the
city of an unique greenfield site.
At the close of the public hearing Councillor Irons said the planning
application was likely to be considered at a meeting on October 12.

A MOTHER who won a legal battle in US courts for custody of her three
young children returned to Britain yesterday '' elated and excited''.
But there was also anger at the Hague Convention, which forced Mrs
Jane Roberts to fight for her children through the courts of two
countries.
Mrs Roberts, 31, arrived at Gatwick with her three daughters and said:
''It's absolutely fantastic. I'm numb and I can't believe it yet.''
She had been forced to live with her children Britainy, nine, Emily,
seven, and Dorigen, four, in a caravan while her estranged husband,
state trooper, contested custody in a Massachusetts court.
She had to return to the US under the Hague Convention after her
husband, Kevin, applied to the High Court in London to have the children
returned. But when he dropped the case she was free to return home to
Brede, East Sussex. He has agreed access in America at Christmas and
summer holidays.
But amid all the excitement there was anger and criticism over the
Hague Convention.
Solicitor Trevor Cooper said: ''It's the Hague Convention that caused
this situation. It was not the convention that ended it. Jane's
perseverence caused the outcome.''
There were calls for the convention to be amended so that undertakings
given in the High Court by husbands are legally enforceable in their
home country.

Opera
AFTER last year's disappointing Tosca, ENO needed a success with big
box-office potential to open its new season. Step forward the
ever-reliable Jonathan Miller, who has delivered what promises to be a
classic Coliseum crowd-pleaser to match his immortal Rigoletto and
Mikado.
The good doctor has transposed Bizet's tale of smugglers, toreadors,
and a sultry gipsy into the thirties Spain photographed by Henri
Cartier-Bresson. Flamenco, frills, and tight cummerbunds have been
ditched in favour of Miller's beloved fedoras, tailored double-breasted
suits, and an erotic fug of cigarette smoke and sweat.
Gone also is the Carmen-as-victim-of-a-male-world reading that drives
the women crazy. Instead, Louise Winter plays her with a brooding
indifference; this Carmen knows what she wants and is unimpressed by
those who tell her otherwise. Even after a desperate Don Jose has
stabbed her she refuses to give him satisfaction: she dies without a
cry, scrabbling for her mirror and lipstick.
The American Robert Brubaker is a spoilt-child Jose with a big,
beautiful voice showing only a touch of first-night strain. Janice
Watson wanders on and off as Micaela and steals the show with the
poignancy of her singing. Robert Hayward's Escamillo, more Mafia don
than toreador, earns a big Ole!

THREE Scots sisters who followed advice they had been taught at school
and in the Guides to lead their family from their blazing home, are to
front a new Government fire safety drive.
The girls -- Donna-Marie Blyth, 16, and sisters Tracy, 15, and Claire,
13, -- have been chosen to spearhead the Scottish Office advertising
campaign, to be launched on September 25, the beginning of National Fire
Safety Week.
Further recognition of the Blyth girls' cool reactions is expected
three days earlier when they will appear in Lifesavers, the BBC's junior
version of the popular 999 series, re-enacting real-life emergenices.
The Scottish Office initiative follows the 1992-93 fire safety
campaign, which had the theme of ''maintain your smoke alarm'' and
included the screening of a 30 second TV commercial and full page
newspaper adverts.
While fire deaths generally across Scotland have fallen in the last
decade, domestic blazes still caused 107 fatalities in 1993, prompting
the Scottish Office to take further action to cut the toll.
The girls were praised by firefighters for maintaining a clear head
when a fire broke out at their home in Gilmerton, Edinburgh, in March
1994.
The youngsters were awakened by a smoke detector and calmly closed
doors and used clothes to block doorways and keep smoke at bay.
Donna-Marie also leapt from the window of her ground-floor bedroom to
raise the alarm with neighbours.
When firefighters arrived at the family home in Walter Scott Avenue
they found the girls, their mother and grandfather, Mr Patrick Coyle,
already waiting at first-floor windows.
Mrs Maureen Blyth, who was treated for smoke inhalation with her
father, said yesterday she was ''very proud'' of her youngsters and
delighted to be involved with the campaign.
''Since the fire, we are all a wee bit more careful. Nothing is left
plugged in except the fridge and we close all the doors downstairs,''
said Mrs Blyth.
She stressed the importance of having and regularly checking smoke
detectors and planning for an alarm in the middle of the night.
Mrs Blyth said their escape had prompted action among friends and
neighbours, who had not only bought smoke detectors, but also made
regular checks to ensure they were in full working order.
She also pressed home the importance of teaching children fire safety.

Look at me while I'm talking to you! David Belcher sits up straight
for the Dame Edna Everage experience
FOURTEEN photographers and one TV film-cameraman were fidgeting at the
foot of the Glasgow Hilton Hotel's grandest staircase. ''She's not the
kind of lady who can be pressed,'' a PR adjutant nervously confided,
seeking to explain the delay in the arrival of the assembled
lenspersons' target, Dame Edna Everage.
Lady? Dame Edna Everage? We pondered these disparate concepts.
Eventually it transpired that while Dame Edna may be no lady, and she
may not be easily pressed, she sure can provide a memorable press
conference.
Why, possums, Dame Edna's quotable quips poured forth yesterday in
advertisement of her forthcoming stage shows in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
And she could certainly give Baroness Thatwoman a few lessons in
bossiness, not to mention power-dressing.
Having been further delayed by a post-staircase change of costume,
Dame Edna swept into our cramped orbit with forthright orders for the
camera-toting interlopers hogging the room's front rows ahead of 34 meek
and expectant scribblers, between us covering the spectrum of print from
Gay Scotland to Francis Gay's Sunday Post.
''Photographers!'' Dame Edna trilled menacingly, settling into a
baronial high-backed chair. ''We've had our photo-call . . . this is
words. At the back, or out. Don't sulk, though.'' The snappers didn't
sulk. However, they did retreat.
''If you pluck up the courage to ask Dame Edna a question, give your
name and newspaper,'' instructed Richard Jarman, our MC for the day as
well as being full-time supremo of the Theatre Royal, venue for Dame
Edna's Glasgow shows.
We blanched, shuffled, and stared down at our shoes. With trademark
forcefulness, Dame Edna opted to start her press conference supremely
unperturbed by the press's lack of vocal participation.
She recalled her last Scottish performances, at Glasgow's King's
Theatre and Edinburgh's Playhouse, regretting the passage of too many
years since those shows, ''or my sharings, as I call them. This visit,
Caledonia, is long overdue. But at least since I was last here you've
refurbished new auditoria just for me!''
Onwards Dame Edna rolled, looking around the room and tut-tutting at
journalists' increasing reliance on tape recorders instead of pens and
notepads. Evidence of a lack of education, she felt, thus taking it upon
herself to spell out words we might have trouble with. ''Minsk is a city
in Russia, spelt M-I-N-S-K . . . and that's S-H-O-S-T-A-K-O-V-I-C-H . .
.''
Dame Edna's first exclusive revelation came after three minutes. An
improbably-named Scottish-based Italian composer -- not Shosta-wotsit --
is apparently working on an opera based on Dame Edna's life story. ''And
that's so much of an exclusive that not even the composer knows about it
yet.''
Madge Allsop, a hack managed to gulp, having noted that Dame Edna's
long-suffering bridesmaid will be making a historic first appearance
during the show.
''Madge is the sort of man . . . no, woman,'' Dame Edna began,
thereafter seamlessly digressing into fresh revelations about the
hormonal imbalances which bedevil Madge's life. Dame Edna's manager,
Barry Humphries, a noted ad-libber, would certainly have been proud of
her, had he been present.
Dame Edna made no such slip when she more closely observed the antics
of the aforementioned TV cameraman. His camera was focused away from
Dame Edna. This was plainly criminal.
''There's a man in here filming the audience! Judging by the amount of
attention he's drawing to himself, he must be from the BBC. Your viewers
will not be interested in a room full of journalists! Even though many
of them will have cleaned their teeth for this occasion.''
With what other frank remarks did Dame Edna favour us? ''The only love
I need is the love of my audience . . . does that sound corny? It is.
Does it sound as though I don't mean it? That's because I don't mean
it.''
She let slip that she has been invited to the Edinburgh Festival, but
would go only on one condition: that it be re-named the Ednaburgh
Festival. This has yet to be complied with by the event's humourless
overseers.
Her autobiography is now available in paperback (''or pauperback, as I
call it''). Speaking of books, Dame Edna would have liked an affair with
Compton McKenzie. Speaking of love, she is currently receiving nuisance
mail from Larry Fortensky, who has evidently developed a taste for
squillionairesses with links to the cosmetic industry.
On a similar theme, Dame Edna denied having had face-lifts. ''Time has
in fact made so little impression on me that I've been cosmetically aged
. . . a plastic surgeon gave me Joan Rivers's crows'-feet and this
double chin is fashioned from one of Liz Taylor's love-handles.''
Of her Australian compatriots, Dame Edna neither knows nor cares what
Mel Gibson may or may not wear under his kilt in Braveheart; Clive James
was bald even as young boy; the seeds of Germaine Greer's feminism were
sown during Germaine's childhood exposure to the marital division of
labour in Dame Edna's Melbourne kitchen, where the late Norm did
everything.
We journos weren't going to get away without a final scolding. ''I see
you as conduits to the public -- that's C-O-N-D-U-I-T-S . . . sometimes
pronounced 'cundits,' although not on prime-time TV. It's tragic to
think that all my talking here today will end up as the briefest
telegramese, mis-spelt and misunderstood.''
We try, Dame Edna, we T-R-Y.
* Dame Edna's Scottish dates on her two-month, seven-city UK tour are
at Glasgow's Theatre Royal from December 4 to 9 and at the Festival
Theatre, Edinburgh, from December 11 to 16.

ONE of Glasgow's most popular trade unionists, Mrs Ina Love, bows out
from the TUC's general council today.
The former Stobhill hospital telephonist has served as a lay
representative on the movement's ruling body for eight years.
General secretary John Monks paid tribute to her for ensuring the
general council was always made aware of the particular difficulties of
the low paid, an apt testimony as the TUC agonised this week over how to
press for a minimum wage.
Born in 1928, in the thirties her father was put out of work and her
mother was forced to take various poorly paid jobs in order to care for
her and her three sisters.
In Brighton this week, she said that in her earlier years she was
mostly influenced by her grandfather, Mr Johnny Dinning, an old-time
trade unionist and Scottish socialist.
''His passion, compassion and ideals and belief in working people
stayed with me always,'' she said.
At 14, she went to work in the local meat market and then at 16 into
the Post Office where she became a telephonist and a member of the Union
of Post Office Workers.
She was in the WRAC for four and a half years.
In 1962 she joined the National Health Service through working as a
telephonist at Glasgow's Stobhill hospital where she was a superviser
until two years ago.
Over the past 33 years, Mrs Love held numerous posts as a lay member
in her union, Nupe, which recently joined with health union Coshe and
local government staff union Nalgo to form Unison.
Among the positions she held were that of the chairperson of the
Scottish TUC committee and Nupe executive member before becoming its
president in 1988-99.
''I hope I have carried forward the fight in the Scottish tradition --
it has not been about medals or badges -- but achievements on behalf of
working people,'' she said yesterday.

PHEW, I think, would be the word for it. Six down, six to go. The
first half-dozen semi-finalists in the SIPC went through hoops yesterday
in a marathon session of recitals running for just under nine hours.
And it was big stuff all the way with the mandatory Beethoven sonata,
and the commissioned work, a fiendish little Capriccio by Frank
Spedding, which brought a bewildering range of interpretations in which
the young pianists found influences from Stravinsky to stride piano.
Apart from that, it was a free choice, and the six contenders threw
everything at us but the piano itself: We had Rachmaninov (hammered),
Prokofiev (riveted), Ravel (splashed) and Liszt (challenged).
Beethoven, as ever, found them out. Both Bartlomiej Kominek and Ruslan
Sviridov, and two of the Brits, William Fong and Roger Owens, one way or
another stumbled at the Beethoven hurdle. Often it was the classic case
of treating Beethoven's passage work as decorative when it is not; it is
structural.
Special mention here to another Brit, Charles Owen, for the
philosophical, wonderfully world-weary opening to his Beethoven sonata.
Recital of the day, however -- whether she goes any further in the
competition or not -- came from the American Lori Kaufman, who, with
some of the most poetic and fragrant Beethoven in the competition,
melted even the heart of this cantankerous old structuralist. Six to go,
and the finalists annnounced late tonight.

<HEADLINE>Operation involving informer led to party shooting. Yard chief defends gangster link-up</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>13</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976371945</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR police officer yesterday defended his force's handling of the
case of a Yardie gangster who was allowed into Britain and later helped
carry out an armed robbery.
But Scotland Yard's director of intelligence, Commander John Grieve,
expressed regret that Rohan Thomas was able to help rob more than 100
revellers at gunpoint at a blues party in a disused warehouse in
Nottingham.
''We deeply regret that an operation we were involved with here, that
people we were involved with, then went to Nottingham and committed a
violent crime, and there is no excuse for that,'' he told a news
conference.
Mr Grieve would not be drawn on exactly how much Scotland Yard knew
about Thomas's violent background at the time he arrived in this
country.
But when it was put to him that a convicted drugs killer managed to
get into Britain, he said: ''Yes, that's true.''
Although Thomas managed to evade the attention of the police to go to
Nottingham and commit the robbery, officers were able to track him down
very quickly afterwards, Mr Grieve said.
Thomas was encouraged to fly to Britain by a police informer, Eaton
Green, to help him gain information about crimes.
It is believed that Green thought he would gain ''street credibility''
by arranging for Thomas to get into Britain, which would put the
informer in a better position to gather information about crime related
to the Yardies, notorious Jamaican gangs.
During the robbery at Nottingham, which took place in May 1993,
27-year-old Green shot a man in the foot and fired into the ceiling of
the building.
Thomas, 36, was convicted on Wednesday of armed robbery after a second
trial at Leicester Crown Court.
Green had already admitted conspiracy to rob, possession of a firearm
with intent to endanger life, and unlawful wounding.
Mr Grieve said the Metropolitan police had been involved in an
international intelligence operation involving authorities in Jamaica,
the United States and Canada.
He suggested that Thomas's violent background was not known to the
force when he and a companion, Cecil Thomas, who was not related,
arrived in the country.
''We made a decision based on the information we had available to us
at that time,'' he said.
''If we had known they were illegal immigrants, they wouldn't have got
into the country. These people move around the world on false passports
and under assumed names.
''We know a lot more about these people now than when they arrived.''
The force had striven to strike a balance between the need to protect
the Nottingham public and the need to protect a highly-valued informant.
The case had involved high level discussions with prosecutors, up to
and including the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mrs Barbara Mills,
about the amount of information that would be revealed.
Decisions had been taken against the background of ''internecine
warfare'' in the south London drugs world which had seen 13 people
murdered within a period of around 18 months, Mr Grieve said.
He acknowledged that one of the objectives was to enhance the
informant's credibility.
''Allowing the informant to gain some credibility, we put him beside
these two people and we knew where they were. When it became necessary
to find them we found them.''
Unofficially, sources are saying that police did not know that Thomas
had convictions for murder.
They were dismissive of allegations made in court that there was a
conspiracy between Green, his police ''handler'', and the immigration
service to allow Thomas into Britain, insisting they would never have
allowed anyone they knew to be a potential killer into the country.
Officers knew it was a high-risk strategy but decided it was necessary
to gain an entry into the underworld of Jamaican drug gangs in Britain's
inner cities.
Police did not deal with the two men at their point of entry into the
country, Mr Grieve insisted.
Officers had weighed up the pros and cons of allowing the pair to
enter Britain on the basis of the research they were able to conduct
after they were informed that the two men were heading to the UK.
Yardie gangs operating via a network linking Kingston, New York and
London are suspected of being the main force behind the spread of crack
cocaine in Britain.

Theatre
THE autumn season at the Lyceum gets off to a magnificent start,
appropriately enough with a big, bold play about theatre itself.
Timberlake Wertenbaker's drama, first produced at London's Royal Court
in 1988, is a fascinating piece, loosely based on fact, about a
production of George Farquhar's The Recruiting Officer that was
performed by the first convicts to colonise Australia.
Wertenbaker's skill, in a play that is written with great economy and
subtle theatrical flair, is to lead us through a complex debate about
the role of the arts in society without ever seeming heavy-handed or
indulgent. By rooting her deeper themes in the emotional lives of the
characters, she gives us a rich, accessible, and compelling piece of
theatre that engages the mind as much as the heart.
It's great to see a play of ideas that is not laboured or abtuse but
funny and invigorating, and Caroline Hall's production, at
two-and-a-half-hours long, simply sails by.
I gave up trying to select star performances among this big 10-strong
cast, already working as a tight ensemble and showing tremendous promise
for the season ahead, so perhaps it's politic to name Jayne McKenna, a
recent graduate of the RSAMD, who holds her own in a prestigious company
that includes Ann Louise Ross, Tom McGovern, and Jimmy Chisholm.
It's all beautifully staged on a set by Matthew Wright. Enhanced by
Stella Goldie's fine, atmospheric side-lighting it's as meticulously put
together as it is intelligently played.

Performance
THUNDER is muttering through the downpour in the background. A woman
in green, her skirts long, pale trails of tulle, hangs from a high rope
like some dormant midnight moth. The whiff of untoward Gothick heightens
-- a bell tolls, footsteps echo, a door creaks . . . then slams shut. A
sudden heartbeat booms and throbs. Thin fingers of light play through
the gloom, music -- a trace of Celtic harpery? -- and the figure stirs,
comes slowly to earth and discards her chrysalis.
Bloodbirds -- as its eerie opening image suggests -- deals in
influences and circumstances that confine and define women. There's much
that is familiar ground, here: the insecurities and fears that stretch
from childhood ever onward, the shifting nature of female friendship,
the need for approval, the need to control, above all the need to
survive all of this. What transforms this bedrock stuff, however, is the
presentation. Bloodbirds looks stunning.
There's been a radical overhaul in the weight of its initial Fringe
showing. The material has been revised and -- most importantly -- it's
in a space that accommodates Paul Sorley's full lighting design. And
what an exquisite, painterly design it is.
In all, this represents a quantum leap from Victoria Beattie's first
piece for her company. Her images of female relationships and
personalities may not exactly chart new territory but there are
instances of steely, unsentimental text that augur well, as does her
obvious faith in the power of cogent visual images.

CONGRESS backed a campaign to give convicted prisoners the right to
vote, although the call provoked a row.
A card vote supported the motion by 3,932,000 to 2,265,000.
Jo Thompson, an official of the National Association of Probation
Officers, said banning prisoners from voting was an ''unnecessary
denial'' of basic human rights. It excluded prisoners from taking their
''share of responsibility in society''.
Having the vote was a basic civil right which had been long fought
for, she said.
However, Civil and Public Services Association delegate Tony Rouse
said the motion showed how ''out of touch'' congress was. ''Is anyone in
this hall really convinced that ordinary trade unionists would support
us calling on the Government to give the vote to convicted prisoners?''
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said later: ''Labour disagrees with
the TUC's decision to vote in favour of enfranchising prisoners. Our
position will not change. Prison necessarily involves the loss of
liberty -- that is its point.''
Prisons Minister Ann Widdecombe also condemned the vote.
''The Government remains of the view that people who are convicted of
crimes which are sufficiently serious to warrant their removal from
society do not have the moral authority to vote for the way that society
is run,'' she said.

The beans have been spectacularly spilled by Bernard Connolly in his
book The Rotten Heart of Europe, as Michael Fry explains
EVEN in these liberated days, not many books carry on their
dust-jacket a cartoon of a small boy peeing. It recalls, of course, the
most famous tourist sight in Brussels, the Manneken Pis. But here he is
labelled ERM, Exchange Rate Mechanism, and he is directing his jet over
a map of Europe.
Though it might have been appropriate in the circumstances, the small
boy bears no resemblance to the author. I can vouch for this because I
knew Bernard Connolly at Oxford, where I remember him for his drinking
and his fanatical devotion to Manchester United, tastes perhaps a little
too studiedly proletarian amid the dreaming spires.
The next time I saw him was on the day he joined the European
Commission in 1978, just after I had myself arrived there for a
three-year stint as the Scotman's correspondent. I came across him again
from time to time, pint in hand in one of Brussels's British pubs, or on
what he aptly calls the rubber chicken and warm champagne circuit. But
he appeared to be worming his way anonymously into the asbestos of the
Berlaymont, and I did not bother to cultivate the connection.
This turned out an error on my part, because Bernard was never quite
what he seemed. Married, sober, and industrious now, he soared up the
Commission's hierarchy to a truly dizzy height, head of the office
dealing with the European Monetary System. No fool or cipher gets there.
He must at the same time have been pulling the wool over the eyes of
his employers, to the extent at any rate that he became more and more
disillusioned with what he was doing. At last he can stand it no more,
and this book is the result. I cannot think of a case where the beans
have been more spectacularly spilled by one who has stood so close to
the centre of events, and who knows exactly where all the bodies are
buried.
He demolishes root and branch the whole effort to work towards
monetary union which has used up so much of the energy of Europe's best
and brightest. The fact that they wasted their time is a matter of
chagrin not only to them, but also to the rest of us, who in consequence
of their efforts are poorer than we otherwise would have been.
Bernard is a plain talker, and spares nobody. His passionate tone has
already helped to define -- notably in the Financial Times, part of the
Europhile Establishment which he so despises -- the reaction by which
the cogency of his arguments might be wished away. Connolly obviously
has his head screwed on, it will airily be said, but he goes a bit over
the top.
Still, I suspect he will not in the end be so easy to dismiss. He is a
first-class economist. Since he was trained up in the old PPE school at
Oxford, he has the gift of simple exposition, of writing out abstruse
matters, things that a younger generation can only express with
equations, in connected sentences accessible to any intelligent reader.
More to the point, he has Europe's monetary history of the past 20
years absolutely at his fingertips, and at a level of detail which few
critics will be able to rival, without obscuring the broad lines of his
argument. And there he is a master of logic, demonstrating how at every
point the ERM has results quite the opposite of what it was supposed to
deliver.
If this is starting to sound a bit forbidding, let me also say that he
retains the sparkling wit of his Irish ancestors. It is deployed nowhere
more devastatingly than in showing how his present-day Irish cousins
have run themselves into the ground in their efforts to prove themselves
good Europeans. Their little legs have desperately churned to keep up
with the loping Germans, all in the probably vain hope of the
''Delorsian Golden Calf'', a swelling stream of subsidies from Brussels.
For myself, I am always won over by an author who deploys biblical
metaphors. You can even tell which translation Bernard reads. He quotes
the ''ulterior darkness'' of the Jerusalem Bible rather than the ''outer
darkness'' of the Authorised Version: a good Catholic boy indeed.
As to the substance of the book, British readers may be especially
intrigued by two strands of the story which emerge with greater
precision from the perspective of Brussels than they do on this side of
the North Sea.
First, there is more than meets the eye to the alliance of Germany and
France which has apparently directed the destinies of Europe and which,
to the lamentation of our own Europhiles, excludes us. Actually it has
concealed a battle to the death between the Bundesbank, determined not
to be voted out of existence by disreputable politicians, and a French
elite equally determined to be the arbiters of the future and so to get
their hands on the said Bundesbank.
The method they have chosen is the European Monetary System and the
European Central Bank which it envisages. If that bank is ever set up,
the Bundesbank will be merged into it and lose its cherished
independence, together with any ability to thwart the planned French
takeover. In case this latter sounds a far-fetched notion, Bernard
Connolly reminds us of General De Gaulle's reply to a startled Henry
Kissinger who asked him how he proposed to limit German influence in
Europe. ''Par la guerre,'' said the lapidary statesman, and during the
last few years la guerre has been fought over la monnaie.
For part of that time, the Bundesbank could hide behind the shield and
sword of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who shared many of its tactical aims.
Once she was gone, the struggle became naked.
It reached climax in the collapse of the ERM in the summer of 1992, a
moment of truth when the Germans refused to grant the terms insolently
demanded by the French, authors of their own woes, that would have been
necessary to keep them in the system. Blamed on speculators, as usual,
the collapse was in fact a victory for the Bundesbank -- yet not a final
victory, for the French machinations continue.
The second strand which Bernard Connolly brings out is the motive of
those machinations, not just a thirst for power, though certainly that
too. It arises organically from the French conceptual universe
especially as this concerns the state and the state's relation to
society. It therefore naturally comprehends economics.
Students of economics in this country learn to define money as a
medium of exchange, store of value, and so on. To that list the French
elite would have to add that they regard money as an instrument of
power, and so as a means of defining the extent of power, of setting the
limits to a sovereignty. ''Europe will make itself through money, or not
at all,'' a Frenchman famously said, and he meant it not just as a neat
aphorism. What he meant was that where European money is, there is
European power. And if that European money is controlled by Frenchmen,
in line with the elite's purposes, then their writ will run all over
Europe.
This flies in the face of what Connolly labels as Anglo-Saxon
conceptions, where the state is just there to form a framework for
relations voluntarily entered into by its members. Economic relations,
along with all others, are thus basically free, not a matter for
determination by the state. This, of course, more closely accords with
the global economy in which we live, which is why Connolly thinks that
efforts towards European monetary union are doomed.
It also explains why men such as Jacques Delors hate the global
economy, detest the Americans and Japanese, and have been prepared to
inflict any amount of damage on Europe in an effort to fence it off and
rule it themselves.
Is this our Bernard going over the top again? He obviously has a
penchant for conspiracy theories, and the most spine-chilling moment in
his book comes when he digs out some of the economic plans of the Third
Reich, once it had Europe at its feet. It was all there in the New
Order: a common market, a common currency, a deliberate repudiation of
the idea that ordinary people, in an economic or any other sense, should
run their own lives.
So I am not so sure Bernard is going over the top. What I do recall is
that we condemn the Germans of that era, especially those who knew the
truth, for not speaking the truth, for just following orders, and
letting the darkness gather.
As far as I can tell, Bernard does know the truth, and he has spoken
the truth. I am very glad he has turned out so well.

TRADERS in Edinburgh's historic Old Town were yesterday told they
could boost business by sprucing up their shopfronts.
A joint drive between Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (LEEL) and
Edinburgh Old Town Renewal Trust aims to upgrade the area between
Waverley Station and Chambers Street, which attracts thousands of
visitors every year.
Both groups believe high-quality, well-designed shopfronts will not
only raise traders' profit margins but will encourage others to invest
to attract more visitors.
The enterprise company has set aside #250,000 for the project, and
additional funding will be provided via the Old Town Renewal Trust --
which will administer the programme, providing advice and assistance
with design and planning procedures.
The level of financial assistance for each applicant will vary
depending on the scale and nature of the refurbishment, but shop-owners
could find up to two-thirds of the total cost will be covered, said
organisers.
Owners and tenants heard that a survey showed existing businesses that
had upgraded their frontage had seen sales rise by as much as 20%.
Speaking at the launch of the Shopfront Improvement Initiative, Mr Jim
McFarlane, LEEL Director of Property and Environment, said: ''The survey
we carried out told us that 88% of traders believed that shopfront
improvement would benefit their businesses.''
Mr Jim Johnson of the Old Town Renewal Trust said guidelines covering
both contemporary and traditional designs had already been drawn up.

As Allan Stewart gets back on the comeback trail, James Freeman charts
his career and asks if he would consider going back into Government
THE Eastwood MP, Allan Stewart, wears a hedgehog tie and his
countryside home outside Neilston in Renfrewshire has hedgehogs
everywhere -- big stone hedgehogs, small plaster hedgehogs, and
hedgehogs on the walls.
He is a member of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, which, he
adds solemnly, suits his politics since the hedgehog has remained
unchanged for two million years -- much as Tory thinking has. The
twinkle in the eyes belies the solemn expression. He is indulging in his
favoured self-effacing humour, rare in any politician.
But his political thinking has genuinely changed only marginally over
many years for the very good reason that, as a member of the St Andrews
University libertarian school of conservative thought he was Thatcherite
before Thatcher, a far-right free marketeer before the ideas became
common currency. Now, he says, socialist governments all over the world
are privatising like mad.
''I was a strong supporter of Margaret Thatcher but I never regarded
myself as an extremist. Undoubtedly the market side of the argument has
won and state socialism, which appeared for a long time to be winning,
has collapsed. All across the world people no longer believe in state
socialism,'' he says.
Yet back at St Andrews University in the sixties when he was gaining a
first class honours degree in political economy, and exchanging views
with Dr Madsen Pirie and Douglas Mason and their group of right-wing
thinkers -- and later back at St Andrews as a lecturer -- his beliefs
were, he admits, extreme.
''We were pamphleteers,'' he recalls, ''urging the Conservative Party
to take up issues like commercial radio, selling council houses to
sitting tenants, and privatisation. These were radical ideas then, but
no-one would disagree with them now,'' adding, mischievously: ''Tony
Blair is today's leading Thatcherite.''
A North Fifer by birth, Allan Stewart remembers as he first set out in
politics advocating the abolition of the Potato Marketing Board, a
Government device to regulate a free market, and coming mightly unstuck
with the North Fife farmers.
More recently he was at the forefront in pushing for open skies,
giving Glasgow Airport international status -- a free market view with
which no reasonable person would now argue, he believes. The former Tory
Scottish Secretary, now Lord Younger, wanted to protect Prestwick
Airport's favoured status while Allan Stewart wanted it to stand on its
merits, play to its strengths without artificial protection, a view
which seems terribly logical now.
His first brush with national politics was when he stood in Dundee
East against the hugely respected George Thomson in 1970 who proved too
hard to shift. Then, after leaving St Andrews in favour of a post in the
CBI in London, he stood for the local council in suburban Bromley,
winning the nomination for a by-election in front of a certain John
Major by one vote. They became, and remain, friends.
He won the safe Tory East Renfrewshire seat vacated by Betty Harvie
Anderson in 1979, going on to make it the safest Scottish Tory seat. Yet
he admits that, with the party's standing in the opinion polls, Eastwood
is currently marginal. Despite the best Conservative efforts, the Tory
flagship Eastwood District Council is now run by a coalition of Labour,
Liberal, and Independent councillors and the party's present standing in
the polls in Scotland is around half of the figure prior to the last
General Election.
''I am prepared for a fight,'' he says, despite his current 12,000
majority.
''Before we set out on every election I say to my people we must start
from the standpoint that we are 1000 votes behind and we have to
convince people of our case. If you start sitting back on your majority
you are lost before you start,'' he states.
Was it possible that recent events when he was fined #200 for breach
of the peace had strengthened his hand in the constituency?
''I have certainly had much support from ordinary people. There have
been people with extreme views who have supported me but I do not go
along with that. I can honestly say there has been tremendous support
and sympathy. I also believe that people realise that politicians are
human beings like everyone else and as such are fallible. Of course I
have had to put up with quite a few jokes at my expense as well but in
the main people have simply been kind.''
Why had he resigned?
''Immediately after the event the Scottish media reported it in terms
that a Government Minister had been involved in a fracas with protesters
and I really did not think I had a problem. Then the English press got
their teeth into it, portraying it as yet another ministerial
embarrassment for the Government. I knew it would run and run. I am sure
I was right in deciding to resign and I contacted the Chief Whip first,
then Ian Lang. I made up my own mind.''
Would he go back into Government if invited in the event of a Tory
victory in 18 months?
''I have never been fantastically keen on ministerial preferment. I
did not go back when I was invited by Malcolm Rifkind in 1987 because I
had had a really tough experience previously with the teachers' dispute
which was very time-consuming, particularly from a family point of view.
I really enjoyed being Industry Minister and piloting the local
government reform Bill through, but leaving office was not the end of
the world. I am more than happy as a constituency MP. People do not
elect you as a Minister but as an MP to represent them,'' and, again the
self-mocking humour: ''I do miss the ministerial car in from Heathrow.
The tube is a terrible hassle.''
The period leading up to his court appearance had been a major strain,
Mr Stewart says, and the events after the appearance at Paisley Sheriff
Court had been frightening. He had expected a media scrum but not the
vicious nature of the protesters outside the court which meant a police
escort away from the area.
It was all a stark contrast to the start of his comeback trail earlier
this week in the constituency. On Wednesday he made a speech to a
ladies' bridge afternoon in Newton Mearns and presented the prizes. He
talked about devolution. No-one mentioned the M77 extension.

<TEXT>
A DOCTOR has been accused of stealing controlled drugs, including
diamorphine (heroin) and cyclimorph, while working in a Dalbeattie
practice.
Dr Colin Malone has been ordered to stand trial at Kirkcudbright
Sheriff Court on a charge of stealing more than 350 injections of drugs
over a four-month period.
Dr Malone, 32, of Rounall Avenue, Dalbeattie is alleged to have
pretended to four pharmacists that he required quantities of the
controlled drugs diamorphine, cyclimorph, and pethidine for use in
connection with the treatment of patients at his practice at Millisle
Clinic, Dalbeattie.
The charge further alleges that he induced the pharmacists at
Blackwood's Pharmacy, High Street, Dalbeattie -- Mr Alan Blackwood, Ms
Judith Alcorn, Ms Susan Hutton, and Mr John Wilson -- to supply him with
the controlled drugs and thereafter appropriated them to his own use and
stole them.
The offence is alleged to have taken place between January 1 and April
29 this year.
The charge alleges that he was supplied with 130 injections of
diamorphine, ranging from 5mg to 30mg, on 23 occasions between January 4
and April 29; 130 injections of cyclimorph on 26 occasions between the
same dates and of receiving 120 injections of pethidine on 11 occasions
ranging between 50 and 100mg.
Dr Malone was not in court yesterday but a letter was submitted on his
behalf pleading not guilty.
Sheriff James Smith fixed an intermediate trial date of November 2 and
a trial to commence two weeks later.

THE new Deerstalker Express -- so nicknamed because of regular users
among the hunting, shooting, and fishing fraternity -- will be in a much
reduced form.
The London-Fort William run will take 13 hours, two more than at
present -- a time last recorded around the First World War.
The current service has four sleeping cars, one buffet car, and a
guard's van. From September 24 it will continue to run nightly except
Saturday, but in truncated form.
Heading south from Fort William, at 19.45, will be just one sleeper
carriage, with 24 cabins and 48 berths, plus a seated carriage in a bid
to boost revenue.
On arrival in Edinburgh, the sleeper carriage will be linked to trains
from Aberdeen and Inverness, also combined as one train at Waverley
before heading south. There will be no seated accommodation, and the
journey will take 11 hours.
Heading north, a similar three-way split will occur at Edinburgh. A
seated carriage will be added to the sleeper, which will depart the
capital at 5.05am and arrive in Fort William at 10.30am.
By running just one train between Edinburgh and London, the Highland
sleeper's losses will be #580,000 instead of #2.3m. The new service will
need a subsidy of #75 per passenger instead of #157.

THE two officials in charge of overseeing ScotRail's privatisation
appeared uncertain yesterday as to when the invitations to tender will
go out.
Office of Passenger Rail Franchising assistant directors Mr Gary
Backler and Mr James Watson could only say that invitations will be
issued ''sometime next year''.
Both said it was possible -- and expected -- to have ScotRail in
private hands this side of a General Election, due by April, 1997.
But Labour's Scottish transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, declared
last night: ''There is no possibility of ScotRail being franchised
before the next election.''
The London-based Opraf directors were in Glasgow to announce minimum
service levels for a franchised ScotRail in return for subsidies of
#100m. However, despite repeated questioning, they failed to produce a
timetable for invitations to tender to run trains over the Scottish
network.
They declined to say if they would be issued in the first six months
of next year. Both directors conceded a nine month gap will be needed
from the date of issue to the date of privatisation.
They also appeared to distance themselves from the Government's
published target of selling 51% of UK passenger services by April.
ScotRail director John Ellis, who intends to lead a management
buy-out, was later asked if he believed it will be in private hands
before the election. He replied: ''I very much hope so.''
ScotRail's invitation to tender was originally scheduled for this
month, but has been postponed until the spring.
Last week, The Herald published leaked documents, based on an Opraf
briefing paper, which suggest the Government will be fortunate if three
-- let alone 13 -- train operating companies are in private hands by
April.
Mr Backler was asked yesterday if the privatisation programme was a
shambles. He countered that a significant head of momentum has built up,
with 20% of BR services up for sale at the moment and another 20% to be
released by the end of September.
However, he suggested the 51% figure was an ''aim'' rather than a
target. He also denied a decision had been taken to delay ScotRail's
sale. Instead, Opraf was ''merely endeavouring to get it right''.
Further pressed on Opraf's allegedly ''over optimistic'' timetable, he
said that it was always recognised there would be failures with some
franchises proceeding faster than others.
He said ScotRail was not ready to go this year ''because it was
important to get the process right for the long-term''.
Mr Backler anticipated invitations to tender would be issued
''sometime next year,'' and both officials said that it was expected
ScotRail would be in private hands before the election.
Franchising director Roger Salmon, in a statement, stressed the
programme announced last year made clear that timings ''were necessarily
indicative and depended on a franchise's readiness for sale and market
conditions''.
Mr McLeish said the comments suggested the 51% target has ''fallen
apart'', and added: ''Campaigners in Scotland will be encouraged by the
collapse of the Government's franchise timetable programme.''
He added: ''There is no possibility of ScotRail being franchised
before the next election. Opraf has no Scottish office, and no clear
idea as to what is going on in Scottish railways.''

<HEADLINE>Stephen McGregor hears some straight talking from Paddy Ashdown as the Liberal Democrats prepare to head for Glasgow and their annual conference next week. Hard edge to leader in the middle</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHAT is one to make of Paddy Ashdown these days? He has a nice
collection of by-election victories under his belt, yet there is
speculation within his party that colleagues are not pleased with his
performance.
As we talk in his office at the Commons, he gazes out of the window
with the look of a man who either has a vision or is experiencing yet
another chat with a journalist.
He is tougher than you might think, which may be a daft thing to say
about someone with his military history, but let's not forget that he is
leader of a party with a long tradition of -- well, Liberalism.
Listening to the man in the street, trying not to be too much to the
left or the right, putting forward what it perceives to be a measured
political philosophy.
However, get him on Bosnia, and the hard edge of the man who was
listened to in silence during Commons debates and questions on the Gulf
War comes through.
''The Government is now taking actions I have been calling for for
three years. There are those who say you shouldn't use cruise missiles.
Rubbish. War is a nasty business, it's a tough business. You go into it
very reluctantly, but when you do you go in hard.''
So will he go into Glasgow hard? Will he go into the next election
hard? Why are the Liberal Democrats going to Glasgow for their annual
conference instead of joining the bucket-and-spade circuit of Blackpool,
Bournemouth and Brighton?
''Because we are a federal party and because just as we want to create
a federal structure, we should think and act federally ourselves. And we
would not have much commitment to, for instance, Scotland's importance
as a nation within the United Kingdom, if our own conferences were
always held in Harrogate or Blackpool.''
The Liberal Democrats have just put out a glossy, 32-page policy
document on Investing in People, Cleaning up Politics and Building the
Future, which is meant to form the basis of the party's campaigning up
to the next election.
Mr Ashdown also has been active in The House Magazine -- Westminster's
answer to your average, over-the-counter glossy -- stating that his
party ''has to be prepared to speak with a voice that is absolutely
clear,'' and that he thinks the conference will be part of the process
of building that up.
Ask him about the minutiae of the Glasgow conference and he will
quickly switch the conversation on to the generalities. It's not that he
doesn't know about the minutiae, it's just that he his more interested
in the generalities.
''This has been a very interesting year for us. It has been a year in
which a number of questions have been asked and answered. The questions
are: 'Will Tony Blair carry it off for the Labour Party? The answer is
probably Yes.' It's not so much whether he can modernise Labour as
whether he can modernise Britain.
''The second question is are the Tories united, are they going to stay
united, or will they self-destruct, will Mr Major lead them into the
next election?'' The answer to the latter part of that lot -- self
destruct, Mr Major's leadership -- was 'Yes,' but Mr Ashdown was only
just beginning to warm up.
He now came up with a third question which went as one might expect,
as did the answer. ''Is there a role for the Liberal Democrats or are we
going to be swept away on this great tidal wave? Answer -- yes there is
a role, and that is proved by the local election results in which we
held our ground against the Conservatives and made progress across the
United Kingdom, in Scotland as well.
''We have an electoral role to play which is that where we are the
challengers to the Tories, we can beat them, we can be the force that
removes this Government. We have reduced the Government's majority to
single figures. It is the Liberal Democrats that have done that, not
Labour.''
The philosophy is that the Government is out whatever happens, and
that the build-up as far as the Liberal Democrats are concerned starts
here and will gain momentum over the next 18 months.
The Lib Dems have produced their policy document and as far as Mr
Ashdown is concerned it is a menu with prices which will be used by
campaigners on the street and party spokesmen to sell the message.
Then we get some bitterness from Mr Ashdown. ''What do you know about
politics today? People are fed up with it, they are sceptical about it.
They feel let down by it, they feel we speak in a language that doesn't
mean anything to them, all this Westminster talk.
Quite deliberately, the Liberal Democrats are determined to try to
find a new voice, to try to express our views in different ways, in
sharply different ways.
''I want to get the party both in policy terms and in what it does to
cause people to have a sharp intake of breath. What we are trying to do
is break away from the stodgy Westminster style. I think that shows a
party that is self-confident about its message.''
So what's all this we read about pacts and deals? And where is the
clear blue water between him and the other parties? And what about his
own position as leader? The whispering campaigns that suggest that both
the punters and some of his own MPs are less than happy with his
leadership? ''I'm on the Opposition benches, I want to get rid of the
Tories. That's what we're here about. But if you are saying do we agree
with Labour, are we going to support Labour if Labour return to
nationalisation or a command economy, no way.
''If Labour won't commit themselves to constitutional change, no way.
We have staked out where we stand, it's a challenge to them. Where do
they stand?''
Yes, but if it comes down to a tight Labour majority and he was
offered a Cabinet job in some sort of coalition with Labour, would he
not take that? Surely he could find more accommodation with Labour than
he could with the Tories.
''Rubbish. I'm not interested in getting my bum on the seat on the
Government bench. It doesn't interest me in the slightest. I am
interested in doing things for this country.''
And leadership challenges? ''Balderdash and bunkum. You must be
joking. I have been leader for seven years, I have built this party up
and it has been a long slog. I remember six years ago going to a
conference where our opinion poll rating was so low it was within the
margin of error. It is now the largest Liberal force this country has
had in 60 years.
''After all that, just when it starts to get fun, I'm going to quit?
-- you must be joking. I have been building this thing to do something,
and now we are in a position where we can. We are a democratic party and
I can only be the party leader for as long as my party wants me, and I
only intend to be the party leader for as long as I have something to
say and do.
''But I have a hell of a lot to say and do, and as long as they want
me I have got the time and the energy and the ideas to go ahead and do
it. This is where the fun starts.''
As ebullient and energetic as ever, Mr Ashdown gave me a warm
handshake as we said our farewells, and cheerily said: ''See you in
Glasgow.'' A wee frown did creep across his face, however, when I
pointed out that for the first time in years he would find it difficult
to jog along the beach of a morning.

A PLEDGE to abolish charges for eye tests and dental check-ups was
given by the Liberal Democrats yesterday.
The move is a key feature of the party's health policy document to be
debated at next week's conference in Glasgow.
Prescription charges also would be pegged, while taxes on cigarettes
and tobacco would rise and the money saved set aside for spending on
improved health.
Smoking costs the NHS about #610m each year.
The party's Health spokesman, Mr Alex Carlile, said the plan was to
build on the best of the NHS and put patients before dogma.
''Liberal Democrats will make the health of the nation everybody's
concern by abolishing costs for eye tests and dental check-ups, and we
will give local people more of a say in how their health services are
run.
''We will freeze the level of prescription charges after years of
massive hikes. Patients should come before dogma.
''We will build on the structures within the NHS to make our health
service more accountable, more responsive and in better shape to meet
the needs of the population.''
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell said in a letter to Mr Carlile he was
''intrigued'' by the Liberal Democrat plan as two- fifths of people
already were exempt from eye and dental examination charges.

THE countryside is no longer a ''no-go area'' for Labour, party leader
Tony Blair said yesterday, as he marked a campaign to take on the
Conservatives in the areas where they are traditionally strongest with a
visit to a dairy farm.
Mr Blair, fresh from responding to his internal critics at the Trades
Union Congress, said Labour was not just the party of the inner city,
and promised to take the message to every village, town and city in the
country.
''Our movement was founded to stand up for ordinary working people.
And that is what we are pledged to do today. There are no no-go areas
for Labour,'' he said.
Citing rural Labour-controlled councils in England and the Labour-held
parliamentary seats of Clydesdale and Carrick, Mr Blair promised:
''Before too long, we could claim constituencies such as those of
Michael Forsyth in Stirling.''
He accused the Tories of betraying the home-owners, destroying local
services, and overseeing an increase in rural crime and unemployment.
''They have betrayed people in rural areas just as they have betrayed
those in urban areas,'' he said.
''We all value the countryside. It is a haven for many from the grime
and pace of life in our town and cities. But we know too, that the
countryside is not a theme park or just a place to escape to.
''People work here, some in agriculture, but many more in other sorts
of businesses. It is important to recognise that farming is a business
and the people who live in rural areas work here, their children go to
schools here and they depend on local public services.''
Mr Blair said knew from his own Sedgefield constituency about the
problems that people in outlying areas faced.''Take transport for
example, more and more people are stranded at home since bus
deregulation because the timetables are chaotic and routes have been
changed.
Mr Blair toured Bolebec farm -- which is owned by Bedfordshire County
council -- with farmer John Goodge.
Mr Goodge, 62, who described himself as a ''studiously non-committed
floating voter'', said: ''If I was to commit myself now, I don't think
Mr Blair would pay as much attention to me as if I was non-committed.''
Mr Blair is keen to focus on the budding General Election campaign as
a way of quelling rumbles of left-wing discontent within the party over
his modernisation programme and leadership style. In particular, he is
eager to avoid any embarrassing infighting at next month's party
conference.

A GENERATION of schoolgirls are being let down by the Government's
insistence on team games being part of the national curriculum.
Professor Neil Armstrong, from the Children's Health and Exercise
Research Centre at Exeter University, said girls were far less likely
than boys to continue participation in team games after they leave
school.
Professor Armstrong, a former professional footballer, said: ''I am
not attacking the principle of teams games or competitive sport.
''But hockey and netball have dominated PE for girls in school for
years, yet how many adult women play hockey or netball, compared with
men who carry on with football or rugby?
''Girls would be better being given the opportunity for badminton,
aerobics, or swimming, but the Government is insisting through the
national curriculum that it must include two physical activities, one of
which must be a team game, and possibly both.
''If people think it is important to encourage children to develop a
healthy lifestyle, it is important to encourage the kind of activities
which they enjoy.''
Tests carried out by the university, using portable heartbeat
monitors, showed that, over three weekdays and one weekend day, half the
girls and a third of the boys did not experience the equivalent of a
brisk 10-minute walk.
''The tragedy about girls not developing a healthy lifestyle is that,
as tomorrow's mothers, they will be role models for their own
children,'' said Professor Armstrong.
''If a boy or girl's mother is perceived as active, they are more
likely to be active too.''

THE Royal College of Nursing yesterday came under fire from the public
service union, Unison, over reports that it is to seek local pay deals
with more Scottish trusts.
Mr John Lambie, Scottish head of health for Unison, accused the RCN of
reaching ''new heights of hypocrisy'' and of misleading its members and
other staff.
He added: ''After first accepting local pay in June, then condemning
everybody else for accepting what they said was local pay in September,
they appear to be back in local pay mode.''
Mr Lambie said Unison planned to ballot its 10,000 Scottish members on
the national plan hammered out in London last week, which agreed a
national minimum wage structure with additional payments negotiated
locally.
RCN spokeswoman Ms Margaret Pullin said the RCN represented 300,000
professionals nationwide and added: ''We have fought hard to retain the
pay award body. What they (the other unions) are suggesting compromises
the pay review body, which is essential to the profession.''
Unions threatened industrial action over the Pay Review Body's
recommendation of 1% plus up to 2% negotiated locally. The RCN said it
hoped to beat the plan by getting 300 of the NHS trusts to accept a
minimum 3% deal, which they claimed would effectively be a national
agreement. The 300 target was reached this week.
But Scottish trusts have lagged behind the rest of the UK in making
improved pay offers. Only 15 out of 47 have agreed to the 3% ''without
strings''.

<TEXT>
NEARLY half the children who are knocked down crossing the road have
followed the Green Cross Code.
They have looked, but failed to see the car which hit them, said Dr
James Thomson, a psychologist from Strathclyde University.
Now he has pioneered a community project in Glasgow which gives five
to seven-year-olds kerbside practice at crossing the road.
It is aimed at taking road drill beyond the parroting of rules in the
classroom which might mean little in practice to a toddler.
Parents of children at each school in Drumchapel -- with an accident
rate six times the national average -- are trained in instruction and
take the children out in small groups of two or three.
They are taken to quiet streets near their school with hazards such as
bends and hedges and given practice which indicates how well they are
understanding the lessons.
Dr Thomson said that 40% of children who survived accidents said they
had looked for traffic but did not see it.
''We have to get away from simple global rules and get away from the
classroom.
''Young children tend not to interpret what they see correctly.
''They have to ask themselves if the car is moving, if so in what
direction, how long it will take to reach them. They tend to fix on
things which are interesting but irrelevant -- what colour is it, is it
a Cortina, how many people are in it.
''That is why the teacher has to train them by the roadside. The
teacher can tell if they are looking at the important details.''
The project gives each child six half-hour lessons, one per week.
These techniques have helped to bring five-year-olds up the level of
11-year-olds in proficiency, said Dr Thomson.
Since the project started accident figures have also fallen, though he
acknowledged that traffic-calming measures that have been introduced in
the area probably contributed to the improvement.

SCOTCH mist took on a new meaning yesterday when whisky in an aerosol
spray can was produced at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre
in Glasgow.
Whether it catches on as a serious alternative to the dram in a glass
remains to be seen.
The 12-year-old malt in a can was featured by Bavarian firm Czewo at
Aerosol '95, a four-day trade fair attracting 100 exhibitors from 43
countries.
Mr William Cairley, 37, an electrician from Badenoch Road,
Kirkintilloch, commented: ''It's nice when it hits your tongue but I
don't think it reaches the throat. That might be no bad thing, mind
you.''
Ms Carla Corrie, 20, of Glasgow Street, Kelvinbridge, remarked: ''It's
horrible. I prefer lager in a bottle myself. If I ever drink a spirit it
would be a Jack Daniel's.''
The verdict of tradesman Jim Paisley, of Lime Crescent, Cumbernauld:
''It certainly is the real thing.
''Mind you I'm not a whisky drinker by nature.''
Czewo managing director Joachim Czech, said: ''It is a perfect example
of the versatility of the aerosol spray can. We produced it as a gift to
Scotland.''
He said that if the market dictated a demand for the product then
Czewo would produce it.
His firm has been asked by Russian airways Aeroflot to produce a vodka

However, Mr Campbell Evans, of the Scotch Whisky Association,
commented: ''It's nice to see people come up with bright ideas but it's
not the image that people associate with Scotch whisky.''

MAN-MADE black holes the size of mint sweets could be powering the
world in a couple of hundred years, said Ian Fells, professor of energy
conversion at Newcastle University.
''When you look at the most powerful force in the cosmos, gravity, the
logical step is to harness gravitational waves to provide energy,'' he
said. ''I don't know how yet, but if we looked at how black holes are
formed we might be able to make our own.''
Meanwhile, the world would have to find other ways of serving its
growing population in an age of technology. Conventional nuclear energy
depended on uranium deposits, which would be depleted faster than
hydrocarbon fuel sources.
''We could have got by with fast-breeder reactors -- that is why it
was so wrong of the Government to close down the fast reactor at
Dounreay,'' he said.
* Companies which offer gene tests through the post for inherited
diseases such as cystic fibrosis were condemned by Professor Kay Davies,
professor of genetics at Oxford University.
She said it was essential that people received counselling so that
they did not misinterpret test results.
''A test which says you have a 70% chance of developing heart disease
is a lot different from saying you are going to get it,'' she said.
* Unemployment has helped to kill off the Andy Capp image of England's
North-eastern husbands, said Dr Jane Wheelock, of Newcastle University.
A survey in Sunderland had shown that men who were unemployed while
their wives were working had taken on household tasks such as
washing-up, vacuuming and looking after their children.

BOSTON: Being even a little bit plump is bad for your health, a new
study of American women has found. Health experts who studied 115,000
nurses found that even mild to moderate overweight is associated with a
substantial risk of premature death. They say overweight is to blame for
one-quarter of all deaths among middle-aged women, and that women 15%
underweight have the lowest early death rate.

Washington, Thursday
THERE was a sudden and decisive defeat for the new Republican majority
in the Senate last night.
Moderate Republicans and Democrats united, on a vote of 66 to 34, to
throw out proposed and draconian limits on welfare payments to unmarried
mothers.
Conservative radicals, led by Newt Gingrich in the House and Phil
Gramm in the Senate, proposed that women under 18 and women on welfare
who already had illegitimate children would not be eligible for
additional welfare payments if they had more children.
Senator Gramm and others insisted that welfare reform must deal with
the question of illegitimacy: about a third of all children born in the
US are to single mothers.
The current conservative dogma, described as ''tough love'', holds
that illegitimacy and dependency is encouraged by the welfare system.
They want to end subsidies to unemployed women with children.
They believe that forcing women to fend for themselves will drive them
to work. Thus the American work ethic will recover and taxes can be cut.
The Senate flatly rejected the whole argument. There are 14 million
people on the rolls, nine million of them children. It decided if they
are thrown out of the wagon, they will not help the comfortable classes
pull it, they will starve on the roadside.
Catholic senators pointed out that telling women if they had more
children, the child would starve, would increase the demand for
abortions.

Geneva, Thursday
BRITAIN today pledged its support for a complete ban on all nuclear
weapons tests.
The decision was announced at the United Nations Disarmament
Conference in Geneva by British Ambassador Sir Michael Weston.
''I wish now to record my Government's position that the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty should not permit any nuclear weapon test explosion
involving any release of nuclear energy, no matter how small,'' Sir
Michael said.
The decision places Britain in line with the United States and France,
both of which have said they support a total test ban.
Sir Michael added: ''We believe that it would contribute greatly to
the progress of the negotiations if those nuclear weapon states that
have not already done so would confirm that they share this view too.''
The announcement has come even though the Ministry of Defence has long
argued that Britain should retain the right to carry out low-yield
tests.
But the US moratorium on nuclear testing in the Nevada Desert, where
Britain has carried out its more recent tests, effectively ended British
plans.
Despite the row over tests in the South Pacific, France has said it
will give full support to a total test ban treaty once the current
series of tests ends.
The Government's decision was warmly welcomed by Labour, which
supports the so-called zero test ban.
Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark said: ''We have called repeatedly
for a truly Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
''The Government has dragged its feet on this issue for years. It has
at last realised what good sense a complete ban on nuclear testing
makes.
''Labour welcomes the Government's conversion on this issue and urges
it to take a more positive approach to the negotiations.''
All of the five nuclear weapon states -- Britain, China, France,
Russia, and the US -- are participating in the 39-nation forum, which
hopes to agree on a treaty text in 1996.
Britain carried out its last nuclear test in November 1991, and has no
plans to develop a new generation of nuclear warheads.
Russia is also expected to agree to a total ban -- but China's
position is unclear.
Emphasis will now be focused on greater development of experimental
techniques, including computer simulation, lasers, and non-nuclear
explosions.
Meanwhile, outrage continued over French nuclear tests, with South
Pacific nations meeting in Papua New Guinea threatening to end France's
associate status with their regional forum if the tests continued.
The 16-member South Pacific Forum called on France to refrain from
further tests in the region and for other countries to try to persuade
France to stop.
''The outrage of the forum member countries is so much the greater
because of the intransigence of France, together with the People's
Republic of China, in persisting with their nuclear tests in the face of
. . . the worldwide sentiment against testing,'' said a joint statement.
Forum spokesman Sir Geoffrey Henry, Prime Minister of the Cook
Islands, said the forum would review France's status as a post-forum
dialogue partner if testing continued.

Washington, Thursday
SINN FEIN leader Gerry Adams said today that the Clinton
administration was sending ''all the right signals'' by supporting peace
talks in Northern Ireland and separate discussions on the IRA giving up
its guns.
After talks in Washington yesterday with Vice President Al Gore and
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, he said today that America's
''open-door policy encourages dialogue and sends all the right signals
to the British Government and the Unionists''.
He added: ''We obviously are all trying to find formulas which move
the entire peace process forward.''
The White House said Gore and Lake ''see merit in the twin-track
proposal to begin inclusive talks and to establish an international body
to address the issue of decommissioning weapons''. A way had to be found
to resolve outstanding issues and re-establish the momentum of the peace
process.
Mr Adams today called the British demand for IRA weapons to be given
up before Sinn Fein can be included in peace talks unprecedented and
unreasonable. He said it amounted to a ''tactical manoeuvre to fragment
broad consensus in Ireland and lower people's expectations for peace''.
CANBERRA: Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew will visit
Australia next week to seek investment for the province. He will meet
Prime Minister Paul Keating and business people during a five-day visit,
and report on the peace process, the High Commission said. -- Reuter/AP.

LABOUR yesterday accused the Government of waking up too late to the
troubles of Britain's small businesses, after it was disclosed that the
Prime Minister plans a series of regional conferences to hear the
concerns of industrialists and entrepreneurs.
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham said Mr Major was
a ''Johnny Come Lately'' to the subject. ''The Tories have had 16 years
to wake up to the fact that the small and medium-size enterprise was
vital to our economy,'' he said.
The Government Minister for small businesses sat in the Lords, not the
Commons, he added, while Labour had developed a detailed small business
policy. ''The Government have known for years the problems of small
businesses and only the Prime Minister seems to have been ignorant of
them.''
In an initiative to be launched next week, senior Ministers will join
Mr Major at 11 regional conferences to meet up to 2000 businessmen and
discuss a strategy for promoting the needs of firms with fewer than 100
employees.

Mr Paice said the the Government aimed by 1997-98 to see half the
participants in the Training for Work scheme -- the main adult training
programme for long-term unemployed and those with special needs --
getting a job via the scheme.
Mr Barron retorted: ''It will give very little hope to the unemployed
to know that the Minister in charge of training believes that it will
take until 1997-98 for them even to have a one-in-two chance of getting
a job at the end of the training programme.''
A DEE spokesman said the 50% figure was ''a good and valid target''.

Pale
SERB refugees have streamed towards the northern town of Banja Luka
after Croat and Bosnian Government troops drove deep into central Bosnia
this week, say international relief workers.
Routes leading to the Serb-held town were jammed with cars and
tractors packed with refugees in scenes resembling the flight of tens of
thousands of Serbs from the Krajina enclave in Croatia last month, one
relief worker said.
Banja Luka was already swollen with up to 50,000 Krajina Serbs as well
as thousands of civilians who fled from advancing Croat troops in
western Bosnia.
Serb officials hoped that some of the refugees would go to nearby
Prijedor as Banja Luka could not absorb the new influx.
With so many civilians headed north, international relief workers said
the Banja Luka area was beginning to resemble a large refugee camp.
''It's getting very crowded,'' said one relief official.
The International Committee of the Red Cross planned to run a 16-truck
aid convoy with 400 tonnes of food to the Banja Luka area tomorrow.
It was unclear which towns the Serbs still held across a front line
stretching hundreds of miles after reports that the central towns of
Drvar, Jajce, and Donji Vakuf fell into Croat hands this week.
In Pale, many Serbs noted with cynicism that their defence lines
collapsed only days after a Geneva peace conference which obliged the
Serbs to give up about one-third of the 70% of Bosnia they held.
''It's beyond bitterness. After bitterness, you have resignation,''
said one Serb man in Pale. ''The only thing left is to swallow the
pill.''
* ABOUT 8000 Muslims from Srebrenica, the first UN ''safe area''
overrun by Serb troops in July, are missing and cannot be accounted for,
the Red Cross said today.
Survivors of Srebrenica have accused the Serbs of war crimes,
including mass killings of civilians and rapes.
Madeline Albright, US ambassador to the United Nations, last month
showed spy photographs to the Security Council of what appeared to be
mass graves in the Srebrenica area. She said they were strong evidence
that the rebel Serbs executed as many as 2700 people from the town.
The Red Cross said today that 3000 people, mostly men, who were seen
being separated and arrested by Bosnian Serb troops, were among the
missing.
''For those 3000 we have eyewitnesses that they were separated from
their families and abducted by military belonging to the Bosnian Serb
army,'' said Beatrice Megevand, head of the International Committee of
the Red Cross for central Bosnia.
After the July 11 collapse of Srebrenica -- which set in motion the
events leading to the Nato air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs -- the
ICRC collected over 10,000 names of missing people, said Jessica Barry,
an ICRC spokeswoman in Sarajevo.
What resulted was a list of approximately 8000 people: the 3000 seen
being taken away by Bosnian Serb forces, and about 5000 people ''who
have simply disappeared'', Barry said.
The list of 5000 names, also mostly men, believed to have fled the
enclave in the chaos of the Bosnian Serb onslaught, has been submitted
to the Bosnian government to check with its records to see if any
returned to government-held territory.--Reuter/AP.

Washington
THE White House charged today that Belarus may have deliberately shot
down a hot-air balloon with Americans on board and said the government
in Minsk had yet to provide an adequate explanation.
Officials continued to react with outrage to Tuesday's shooting down
of a hot-air balloon which Belarus said had strayed over a sensitive
military installation and ignored warning shots.
''There is some circumstantial evidence that would seem to suggest
that it was not necessarily a tragic mistake and we're trying to get to
the bottom of that now,'' said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
He said that rather than a mistake, the shooting down of the balloon
''seems to have been more deliberate than that''.
''We have not received an adequate explanation but we have had
indications from the government of Belarus that they will work together
with us for the types of inquiries that can provide some answers,'' he
said.
Businessman John Stuart-Jervis, 68, and Alan Bernard Fraenckel, 55, an
airline pilot, were killed when a Belarussian helicopter gunship shot
down the balloon as they competed in an international race.
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said a US consular official
had travelled to Beryoza, the town near where the incident occurred, and
taken possession of the bodies.
Burns ridiculed the Belarussian argument that the balloon represented
a threat to national security.
''This is not 1975. It's not 1965. It's not the Cold War. A hot-air
balloon drifted over an air base in Belarus. For what possible reason
would that balloon be shot down? What possible excuse can they have to
shoot down a balloon, whether or not the particular people on the ground
had received a clearance?
''It was a balloon! It wasn't a jet fighter. It wasn't a bomber. These
weren't tanks on the ground. There is no possible excuse the government
of Belarus can offer to try to escape responsibility for this,'' he
said.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Nuclear Electric fined for delay in shutdown</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976371982</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR Electric was around #400,000 poorer yesterday after sentence
for allowing a nuclear reactor to operate for nine hours when its safety
had been compromised by an accident.
Mr Justice Morland fined the company #250,000 and ordered it to pay
#138,000 costs after a three-day hearing at Mold Crown Court, Clwyd,
Wales.
The company admitted four charges under the Health and Safety at Work
Act relating to an incident at Wylfa nuclear power station in Anglesey,
North Wales, on July 31, 1993.
The accident happened when part of a parasol grab fell into one of the
6156 fuel channels in the reactor, causing a risk of a radiation leak
into the atmosphere.
The judge said the fine should be exemplary ''to underline the public
insistence that the nuclear industry should be conducted with absolute
safety''.
However, he accepted that the failings which delayed the reactor's
shutdown were procedural rather than systematic and that the company had
learned lessons.
The judge said the company had pleaded guilty on the basis that there
was a potential source of danger to the workforce, to people living
round about, and the environment.
But he emphasised that nobody had been exposed to actual danger and
that there was no foundation whatever for the suggestion that there
could have been a meltdown and the possibility of a disaster.
He added that the company had taken proper steps to make a repetition
of the accident impossible.
The judge also rejected prosecution suggestions that commercial
considerations had caused the shutdown to be delayed. He said: ''I
utterly reject any such suggestion. I am sure safety was at the
forefront of their minds, though they were in error in failing manually
to trip the reactor.''
But he said events surrounding the Wylfa accident were very serious
indeed, involving not only basic grade operatives but top local
management and upper management, and that the total fine had to be
commensurate with the criminal breaches.
After the sentence, Mr Ray Hall, executive director of operations for
Nuclear Electric, said the fine was ''heavy'', adding: ''A quarter of a
million pounds is big money.''
He stressed: ''This was a lapse but we will do something about that.
We are always looking for improvements and will continue to do so.''
Mr Hall did not think anyone should resign over the incident and said
the company had set up its own internal inquiry before the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate had decided to prosecute.
But he admitted: ''Three days in the Crown court does not fit in with
what this company is about.''
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham said: ''The
position of those at the top in the company who are responsible for
allowing the reactor to continue when it should have been shut down
immediately should be brought to account by President of the Board of
Trade Ian Lang.''
Mr Cunningham has written to Mr Lang, telling him: ''This case is a
stark example of commercial pressures pushing safety and accountability
down the list of priorities.''
Mr Bill Ross, deputy chief inspector of the Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive which brought the
prosecution, said he was ''very satisfied'' with the fine.
''I think it was sufficient to sting the industry into taking very
good note of the implications and the lessons to be learned from this
prosecution . . .''

Rainbow Warrior II and MV Greenpeace were seized on September 1 by

A FORMER neighbour of John ''Billy Joe'' Crumitie testified today that
she twice heard him confess to the murder of British tourist Gary
Colley.
''He said they didn't have anything on him, and that he shot the
(guy),'' said Dana Smith, 26.
Three days later, while Crumitie was speaking on the phone to Smith's
former boyfriend, Jeremiah Spear, who was in jail, Smith said she again
heard Crumitie confess.
Crumitie is charged with murder, attempted murder, and attempted armed
robbery for the attack on 34-year-old Mr Colley and his fiancee Margaret
Jagger as they slept in a rental car at a highway rest stop on the night
of September 13-14, 1993.
Mr Colley, awakened by the tapping of a gun on his window, attempted
to drive away from two men who were trying to rob them. Miss Jagger was
wounded.
This week's trial marks Florida's third attempt to convict Crumitie.
Two earlier trials, in Monticello and Tallahassee, Florida, ended with
the juries unable to decide. Prosecutors have no physical evidence
linking Crumitie to the crime scene.
If convicted, the 18-year-old faces life in prison without possibility
of parole for 25 years on the murder charge alone.
Last night two prison inmates also said Crumitie had admitted being
one of the triggermen.
Earlier, Mr Colley's mother, Mrs Brenda Armitage of Bradford, west
Yorkshire, dabbed at her eyes with a tissue as photographs of her son's
body were shown to the jury.
It was the first time she had appeared at any trial in the murder.
Mrs Armitage struggled to keep control and even managed a tight smile
when Ms Jagger, 37, comforted her.
Ms Jagger broke into tears several times when she testified yesterday,
repeating the description of the attack by at least two teenagers that
she gave during the other two trials.
''Gary was lying there with blood,'' she said through tears. ''He was
bleeding from his nose and his mouth.''
Again, however, she was unable to identify Crumitie as one of the
attackers.
The hearing continues.--AP/Reuter.

AN abandoned yacht found drifting in the sea with drugs worth #3m on
board was at the centre of a Marie Celeste-style mystery last night.
Customs and Excise officials admit they have no idea how the 41ft
Carla II came to be adrift off south Devon -- carrying a tonne of
cannabis resin.
The yacht was spotted wallowing in the water by the crew of the
Brixham trawler Marilyn Jane. They climbed aboard to investigate -- then
lashed the yacht to their 110ft vessel and brought her into port.
Customs spokesman Mike Thompson said they were ''very grateful'' to
the trawler crew for their action.
He said they had been unable to discover why the crew abandoned the
red-hulled, Italian-registered yacht in the early hours, two and a half
miles off Berry Head, near Brixham.
The trawlermen said they found coffee cups, cereal bowls, and the
remains of a meal in the yacht, which looked as though it had been
abandoned very rapidly.
Among theories being put forward to explain the mystery last night was
the suggestion that a drugs transfer from the Carla II may have been
abandoned because the trawler was in the area.
The drugs almost certainly originated from Morocco, said Mr Thompson,
adding that Customs had yet to establish whether a cruiser seen speeding
from the area where the yacht was found was connected with the drug
trafficking.
The crew of the trawler saw the cruiser minutes before they came
across the yacht with about 5ft of water in the hull -- and a cargo of
some 40 boxes of cannabis.
Trawler crewman Paul Rogers said the first thing he saw on board was a
pair of shoes lying on the deck, so he had a look around in case someone
was injured. ''We found a bonanza of drugs at the front and the back of
the boat,'' he said.
The boxes of cannabis were stacked throughout the yacht, as well as
road maps of Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and France, and a navigation
chart to Gibraltar.
Torbay lifeboat and a rescue helicopter were called out to search for
the crew. Lifeboat secretary Barrie Foster said the yacht was down by
the nose and about to go under when she was spotted by the trawler.
Trawler skipper Martin Rogers has put in a salvage claim for the
yacht, which the police say is worth around #50,000.

Beijing, Friday
THE world's biggest women's gathering was ending today as it began:
with calls for solidarity, heartfelt hopes for change, and reminders
that even a common cause can bring uncommon discord.
The Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing was poised to approve
an ambitious plan to forge a new partnership between the world's men and
women.
An eleventh-hour compromise on sexual freedom broke a deadlock on
drafting of the central Platform for Action, enabling those for and
against new sexual rights to claim victory.
''Paragraph 97 is the greatest success of this conference,'' Irish
delegation chief Avril Doyle said of a key human rights clause in the
platform, the final document that will come from the conference.
''This is because, for the first time ever in the United Nations, it's
been recognised that sexual rights are human rights.''
She added: ''The Islamics can sell this agreement in their countries
with their own nuances, and we can sell it to our countries in Europe.''
However, despite unity on the overriding goal -- bettering everyone's
lives by bettering the lives of women -- divisions on specific points
provoked passionate, sometimes painful arguments among the 189 member
states.
Lesbian rights were debated for the first time at the UN level, but
were dropped from the final draft today. More last-minute bargaining
took place over whether human rights should vary according to religious
and cultural traditions.
The full conference was to vote on the document later today and then
adjourn.
The platform denounced systematic rape as a weapon of war and called
for an end to trafficking in women. It spoke out for more women in
decision-making roles, and worked to balance the rights of children and
their parents. It urged equal inheritance rights and decried sexual
harassment at work.
Cheryl Gillan, Britain's Minister for Education and Employment, said
the conference had been a great success and pledged her commitment to
the Platform of Action.
''This is not a North, feminist agenda. The outcome and conclusions of
this conference will benefit all women, worldwide. In negotiating terms
it has been a triumph,'' she said.
She will report back to Education Secretary Gillian Shephard next
week.
Ms Gillan said that UK delegates would be invited to submit to her by
January 1 their views of how they wanted the Platform for Action to be
implemented in Britain.
Margaret Anderson of the Church of Scotland Women's Guild briefed the
Minister on the comments from delegates who had attended the
non-governmental Women's Forum in Huairou, many of whom have already
left for home.
''We need to know which Government Department head will be responsible
for implementing the different parts of the plan. That is important to
all of us in the UK,'' she said.
Mary Shanahan of the ecumenical group Action of Churches Together in
Scotland expressed anxiety about how the Plan would be monitored.
''We know the UK Government must report to the United Nations in 1996.
We would like to know how the Scottish Office will play a part in that
and how everyone in Scotland will be involved in the assessment for that
report,'' she said.
Bristol-based businesswoman Sylvia Perry was disappointed that the
Government had done nothing to implement the Forward Looking Strategies
from the last UN World Conference on Women 10 years ago in Nairobi.
''The issues have been put on the back burner. However with the unity,
commitment, and co-operation we non-governmental organisations have here
in Beijing, and with the constructive contribution we have made to the
Government's work here, we consider we are owed some real action when we
get home.''

MEXICO CITY: Dozens of people were hurt and hundreds of homes badly
damaged after an earthquake measuring between 6 and 7.2 on the Richter
scale struck southern Mexico.
Radio reports spoke of up to #5m in damage to buildings and many cases
of shock in Oaxaca state, but no deaths or serious injuries. The tremor
came 10 years almost to the day that an earthquake killed at least
10,000 people in Mexico City.

<HEADLINE>Election returns show worrying trend. School boards threatened by apathy</HEADLINE>

HUNDREDS of Scottish school boards could disappear because of parental
apathy, head teachers and local authority officals fear.
Parents have an inbuilt majority on boards and half the seats which
they occupy are up for grabs in the latest round of elections currently
under way.
However, based on early returns from Scotland's biggest region --
where nominations closed earlier this week -- and anecdotal evidence
from secondary heads, one of the Government's flagship education
policies is facing a credibility challenge because of a lack of parental
interest.
In Strathclyde region's Lanark division 30-50% of schools have fallen
short of the number of nominations required to fill vacant parental
places.
About 25% or more will have enough nominations and, based on returns
to date, places will be contested in elections in only 25% of schools
because there are more nominations than available seats.
Early returns in Glasgow division, responsible for more than 300
schools, are showing a similar pattern.
School board unit officials describe the trend as worrying.
In Lothian region, where nominations will not close for another two
weeks, the proportion of schools with boards fell from a peak of 90% in
1990 to 65% last year, although the most recent data shows a rise to
70%.
In Strathclyde, more than 80% of schools have boards, higher than the
national average of about 75%.
The incoming president of the Head Teachers' Association of Scotland,
Mr John Mitchell, said yesterday: ''From the reports I am getting a lot
of schools will not have boards because parental interest has dropped.
''Most schools are filling vacancies by phoning around parents. That
is how I will find the people who will stand.''
Mr Mitchell, head of Kilsyth Academy near Glasgow, has about 800
pupils and a nine-strong board consisting of five parents, two staff,
and two co-opted members. He said there were several reasons for parents
losing interest:
* Being a school board member involved more work than they had
bargained for.
* Some of the tasks were mundane and meaningless.
* They did not have time for all the red tape which came from
Government.
* They felt they were not exerting any real influence on education
policy.
However, he said boards were supportive and had a job to do helping
schools.
A local authority education source commented yesterday: ''School
boards have been a bit lacking in focus and direction.''
Schools which fail to form boards will have another try in
by-elections to be held after the current full elections.
Mr David Hutchison, president of the Scottish School Board
Association, which represents 50% of boards, said parents were still
forming partnerships with schools and their teachers.
The Head Teachers' Asscociation has been invited to a meeting with
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth next month along with other teacher
associations and unions.
Mr Mitchell said the association had concerns which it would put to Mr
Forsyth about workload, which adversely affected staff morale.
There were also concerns about the implications of Higher Still. Mr
Mitchell said he was worried about parents expressing concern if their
teachers temporarily left the classroom to undertake development work on
Higher Still. Extra staff would also be needed, as would money to buy
equipment for information technology and design courses.
Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson is undertaking a review
to find out why parents are not interested in opting their children's
schools out of local authority control.
Mr Mitchell said, if asked, he would tell the Minister that parents
didn't want schools to be self-governing.

<HEADLINE>Rail campaigners warn of other services in danger after future privatisation. Highlands hail Mission Impossible over sleeper</HEADLINE>

A MASSIVE Highland welcome yesterday greeted the reprieve for the Fort
William-London sleeper service.
But grave doubts remain over other sections of the minimum level of
passenger services which a ScotRail franchise holder must meet in return
for subsidies.
In its announcement, the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising found no
room to support sleepers between Plymouth and Glasgow; for Motorail; for
overnight seated accommodation on Anglo-Scottish services; and will
subsidise only one train an hour at night on the flagship
Glasgow-Edinburgh route.
However, it did make 70 changes to the Passenger Service Requirement
following a four-month consultation programme.
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, said the announcement
was not worth the paper it was written on because Opraf and the train
operator would be able to change service levels at any time.
The most dramatic change to the PSR was saving the Fort William
service from the axe.
Highland Regional Council did much to secure that victory, twice
taking BR to court over threatened withdrawals.
Convener Duncan McPherson paid tribute to The Herald for its exclusive
report that ScotRail planned to run ''ghost trains'' to circumvent
statutory closure procedures.
He said: ''The information in that report proved vital to our legal
action in the Court of Session, which was the turning point in the whole
campaign.''
Lochaber Councillor Iain Macdonald also pointed to the importance to
the court actions of the ghost train revelations. They had focused the
minds of BR and Government, and were ''a major factor in the campaign's
success''.
Mr McPherson told the roads and transport committee that the PSR
guaranteeing the sleeper for seven years was ''one of the most
significant achievements in the 20-year history of Highland Regional
Council''.
He said: ''We have achieved Mission Impossible in persuading
franchising director Roger Salmon to retain a service he was set to
abandon last May.''
He was disappointed a third Anglo-Scottish sleeper was not considered
to be a minimum requirement to meet demand in summer months. An early
meeting with ScotRail would be sought to discuss service capacity and
local job prospects.
Mr McPherson thanked Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth for his timely
intervention in supporting the campaign.
Mr Gary Backler, Opraf assistant director in charge of overseeing
ScotRail's privatisation, confirmed that Mr Forsyth had been ''a
consideration''.
However, he added: ''We have made the decision entirely on the basis
of consideration of the importance of the sleeper service to the area.''
It was very remote, had special needs, and the solution protected the
service for the first time while also reducing ''the call on the
taxpayer''. Mr Backler did not accept that the sleeper would not have
been saved but for Highland region's court actions.
Mr Forsyth said Mr Salmon was to be congratulated on changing his
mind. He added: ''I would also like to congratulate all those who played
their part in making representations, not least Highland Regional
Council.''
Labour MP John McFall said the U-turn showed the fight against
privatisation could be won if pressure was kept up. It was a victory
against the Government's disastrous plans, but the stark reality was
that the present service ''has been watered down and is a case of muted
celebration''.
Mr McLeish claimed there was now less subsidy for railways, and in a
reference to Strathclyde's exclusion from the PSR said: ''This has been
a farcical exercise which does not even cover half the Scottish rail
system.''
SNP transport spokesman Andrew Welsh said the sleeper should never
have been threatened, and blamed the Government's ''madcap privatisation
policy''.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye,
said the result vindicated all who set out to defeat the sleeper
withdrawal. He added: ''The West Highland campaign lit a torch -- now
its success must become the turning point against rail privatisation.''
Mr Iain Grant, the Scottish Tourist Board chairman, said it was good
news for tourism and the Highlands.
0 Highlands and Islands Enterprise said it was time to start
developing all Highland rail routes.
The Federation of Small Business said the Deerstalker Express now had
to be promoted. It would be joining HIE in campaigning for the return of
Motorail.
ScotRail director John Ellis was delighted. He claimed ScotRail only
wanted to withdraw the sleepers because, without subsidy, losses of
#2.5m would have had to come from elsewhere in the network.
Mr Ellis confirmed that drivers and conductors would no longer be
taxied from Glasgow to Fort William at a cost of #2000 a week. Local
staff will be used.
Opraf officials said the PSR reflected the needs of Scotland, and
would apply to ScotRail from now on before being incorporated in the
agreement with a franchised train operator.
Mr Backler insisted that Scotland would receive the highest level of
guaranteed rail services in Britain, with subsidies of around 95% of
current services.
He said the PSR provided an unequivocal commitment to fund services on
every single route currently operated. Lines had a better assurance of
long-term financial support than at any time in their history.
Other main changes from the draft PSR include safeguarding the Fife
Circle timetable; guarantees on links with ferry services; and
safeguards to prevent an operator running overcrowded trains across the
Forth Bridge into Edinburgh.
Mr Ellis concluded: ''I hope we have now heard the last from the
Jeremiahs with the gloom and doom forecasts of line closures and
swinging services cuts.''

AN environmental group claimed yesterday that Scotland's newest
nuclear power station was not needed to generate electricity but was
built to keep engineers in work.
The claim is based on data said to be in a letter from a Scottish
Nuclear employee, published in Friends of the Earth's Safe Energy
Journal.
The letter dated May 4 1995, from the company's then corporate
communications manager Irene Currie, responded to an inquiry from a
student about Torness, East Lothian.
According to FoE, she states: ''By the time the decision to build an
AGR had been made at the end of the 1970s, it was clear that not only
had electricity demand flattened off but North Sea gas was abundant and
the need to increase capacity after massive expansion was no longer
there.
''The decision to build Torness -- and its sister station Heysham 11
in England -- was taken in order to support the UK engineering industry
through what was obviously going to be a lean period.''
FoE said this ''admission'' means South of Scotland Electricity Board,
Scottish Nuclear's predecessor, hoodwinked the public and Parliament
into the need for Torness.
Scottish Nuclear said in a statement: ''At the time of the Public
Inquiry in 1974, electricity demand estimates indicated that there could
be an under-capacity in Scotland.
''Over time, electricity estimates inevitably vary. Background
information was summarised by Scottish Nuclear earlier this year in
response to a question from a degree student, indicating other policy
considerations which influenced the final decision to proceed with
construction at Torness.
''Since then, Torness has been owned and operated by Scottish Nuclear,
which has consistently improved output, turnover, and profitablity every
year since the company was established in 1990.''

MOTORWAY drivers had a lucky escape when a car bound for export rolled
off a transporter into the path of oncoming vehicles.
The transporter driver drove on, unaware of what happened to the
Vauxhall Astra estate which was bound for Italy.
He later alerted police by telling them he had ''lost'' a car
somewhere between Birmingham and Southampton.
The incident happened on the M4 on Monday at Chieveley junction, near
Newbury, Berkshire.
Drivers were relieved as the ''runaway'' vehicle harmlessly steered
itself on to the hard shoulder.
PC Martin Pattinson, of Newbury traffic police, said: ''We were on
patrol at 3am when we spotted the dark blue Astra and when we checked
it, it did not have any registration plates, the keys were in the
ignition, and inside were export papers for Italy.
''When we checked with the control room, they said a transporter had
lost a car during its journey.''

LABOUR Leader Tony Blair suffered a damaging blow to his credibility
last night with the unexpected resignation of Mr Kevin McNamara, the
party's front bench spokesman on the Civil Service.
Citing profound disappointment over Mr Blair's Ulster policy, and his
attitude to the trade unions, Mr McNamara, 61, a former Northern Ireland
spokesman, announced he was resigning his front bench duties and
promised to pursue his criticisms from the back benches.
In a clear warning to Mr Blair that the growing clamour of discontent
which has undermined his firm hold on the party will not go away, Mr
McNamara said: ''Healthy criticism of attitudes which parties take helps
to foster debate and the re-examination of positions which are held.''
Unlike the regular stream of criticism from insignificant and largely
unknown left wing MPs that has dogged him over the summer, the defection
of Mr McNamara to the ranks of his opponents is a clear embarrassment
for Mr Blair.
Mr McNamara, speaking on Channel 4 News, accused Mr Blair of paying
too much attention to Unionist demands in setting Labour's Northern
Ireland policy. ''He implicitly gave the Unionists back their veto,'' he
said.
The timing of Mr McNamara's resignation will dismay Mr Blair and his
supporters. With the party conference only two weeks away, he is under
pressure to regain the initiative from the Labour left, which has cast
doubts on the legitimacy of the reforms he has introduced, and on his
presidential-style of leadership.
This week Mr Blair was forced to improvise a passionate appeal for
support at the TUC conference, after the leak of an internal memo
suggesting the party lacked policies and recommending that effective
control of the General Election campaign be centred on Mr Blair's
office.
In a letter last night Mr Blair said he was sorry the MP for Hull
North felt it necessary to resign, and repeated his support for the
Government's approach to the peace process.
''I have been aware for a long time of your dissatisfaction with our
approach on Northern Ireland. I understand your views,'' he told Mr
McNamara.
''But I believe that the bi-partisan approach is the best way to peace
and that to disturb it, particularly now, would be irresponsible and
wrong.
''I have felt a deep responsibility to do all I can to help the peace
process and strongly hold the view that I should not attack the
Government over it unless I believe they are fundamentally
ill-intentioned or mistaken in respect of it, which I don't.
''I think this is especially so over the issue of decommissioning,
which is so immensely sensitive.''
Mr Blair stressed his support for fair treatment of both employers and
unions, saying this had also been the policy of Neil Kinnock and John
Smith and was the position of the TUC.

GOVERNMENT proposals to introduce nursery place vouchers have been
condemned as commercialisation of pre-school education.
South Lanarkshire Council, one of the largest new unitary authorities,
fears that the scheme will force families on restricted incomes to go
for a place based on cost rather than what is best for the child.
Under the proposals, parents of four-year-olds will receive a voucher
worth #1100 enabling them to buy nine months of pre-school education.
But the council's director of education, Ms Maggi Allan, points out
that the vouchers will not meet the cost of most pre-school places on
offer in South Lanarkshire, with these ranging from #1002 to #2280. In
fact the voucher will buy only a limited part-time nursery provision in
the public sector.
Council leader Tom McCabe said one result of the scheme would be to
destroy the relationships local authorities had built with the voluntary
sector by placing both sectors in competition for pre-school business.
The council's executive committee nevertheless decided to take part in
next year's ''flawed'' pilot scheme -- but only if the Scottish Office
guarantees that it is a true pilot project, with built-in monitoring and
evaluation, and a procedure for reporting back findings to local
authorities.

THE Church of Scotland's Woman's Guild, founded more than a century
ago, is considering proposals that would give it a more active role and
greater impact in the Kirk.
The proposals include the introduction of teams to work with
congregations and presbyteries in spreading information about the Kirk's
work.
New approaches to leadership, which would encourage member involvement
and more support for younger women through a new administrative
structure, have also been suggested.
It has also been proposed that some meetings be moved away from
Edinburgh.
The new approach has been discussed over the past two days at a
conference of the guild's central committee in Edinburgh.
It will be considered at a further meeting in February before being
included in a report to the General Assembly.
The Woman's Guild has about 58,000 members.

AN 80-year-old former prisoner of war is facing ejection from his
local British Legion for allegedly fighting.
Mr George Urquart, of Madras Court, Inverness, who survived Japan's
Second World War camps, denies assaulting another member.
He said: ''These days I could not punch my way out of a wet paper
bag.''
He has been suspended by the Inverness branch of the Royal British
Legion (Scotland) and could face being excluded from the club after the
alleged incident on VJ Day.
Mr Urquart said: ''On the night in question I was just sitting down
when I was grabbed by each arm from behind by two men. They dragged me
out to the front door and then they turned and ran away laughing.
''If I did hit anyone, it must have been by accident when I was trying
to get free. It should be the two people who grabbed me who are thrown
out and most people at the club agree.''
The former Royal Scot Redcap was captured during the fall of Hong Kong
on Christmas Day in 1941. He survived savage beatings at the hands of
his captors and being torpedoed on a prison ship.
He said: ''After all that, I am not going to be manhandled by the
British Legion committee.''
Club secretary Robert Inglis refused to comment. He has asked Mr
Urquart to give the club a statement.

TWO burglars, one thought to be as young as 10, smashed through a
63-year-old woman's front door in Birmingham on Wednesday night and
attacked her with a brick as she rang 999, police said yesterday(Thurs).

A RECORD price of #161,000 was paid for a Beatles lyric at Sotheby's
yesterday.
It is one of the highest prices ever paid for any original pop song
lyric.
The handwritten lyric by Paul McCartney for the song Getting Better
was on a piece of headed paper for 1967's Million Volt Light and Sound
Rave. Getting Better was one of the tracks in the famous Sergeant Pepper
album.
The staggering price -- Sotheby's had expected it to sell for between
#45,000 and #48,000 -- brought gasps from the packed auction hall at the
Rock'n'roll Memorabilia sale.
It was sold to an anonymous telephone bidder.
There were murmurs of surprise when the bidding reached #100,000. And
when the final bid was made the auction room erupted into applause.
The sale of Getting Better beats the previous record for a handwritten
Beatles lyric -- #48,500 for John Lennon's lyric for A Day In The Life,
another Sergeant Pepper track.
Earlier in the sale, McCartney's original handwritten lyric for the
hit Ob-la-di Ob-la-da, written on a piece of paper in blue ballpoint,
was sold for #30,582, also to an unknown telephone bidder.
The bedroom door from McCartney's former home at 20 Forthlin Road,
Liverpool, painted white with four panels and circular wooden handles,
was sold for #3875, also above Sotheby's expectation of between #2500
and #3000.
One pair of John Lennon's gold-framed glasses went for #3700 and
another for #3800, but what had been expected to be the star item at the
auction, sketches by John Lennon, failed to excite bidders.
They had been estimated to sell for up to #120,000 but remained unsold
when the bidding only reached #34,000.
The famous peacock feather waistcoat worn on stage by Jimi Hendrix,
who died of a drug overdose 25 years ago next week, was sold for
#24,150.
It was bought by the Hard Rock Cafe group, which will display it at
one of its worldwide chain of restaurants.
The total proceeds from the sale were #739,000, said Sotheby's.

A POOLS syndicate launched a private action yesterday to sue
Littlewoods for #2.3m after a collector who cheated them out of the
jackpot was jailed for 30 months at the High Court in Glasgow.
As Cameron Baxter, 27, a student, was led away to begin his sentence
which involved a total sum of #216, lawyers for the syndicate, five
ScottishPower workers from Stirling, lodged a writ in the Court of
Session to sue the pools firm for the money they thought they had won.
The syndicate has raised #30,000 to fund the private action. Their
lawyer, Mr Cameron Fyfe, said: ''We are prepared to battle all the way.
''Our view is that Mr Baxter was an agent acting on behalf of
Littlewoods Pools who paid him to collect stake money on their behalf,
and hired him and subsequently fired him. Therefore, we believe that
they are liable for his action.
''My clients were deprived of #2.3m because of this man's actions.''
He added: ''The syndicate have pooled their life savings and sold
assets to raise a considerable sum to fight for what they believe they
are entitled to.''
Jailing Baxter, of Wallace Street, Stirling, who had earlier pled
guilty, Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, told him: ''This is a very
tragic case, tragic not only for you and your family, but for others
affected by your crime.
''But it does appear to me that it was a mean offence which involved a
breach of trust. The amount involved was not large but the consequences
for the victims were catastrophic. You deprived them of winning a
substantial amount of money. There's a limit to the leniency I can
exercise having regard to the consequences of your crime.''
He also lost thousands of pounds, which the syndicate disclosed they
would have paid him as a bonus.
After Baxter's court appearance last month, the pools company
confirmed it would have paid out a jackpot of #2,318,311 on the
syndicate's coupon had it been sent.
A Littlewoods spokesman said: ''Only coupons which are in our building
by kick-off time are entered into the competition. Collectors are not
employed by Littlewoods, they are agents of the punters.''
About 70,000 people collect some 300 million Littlewoods coupons in
Britain each year.
It was a year ago that the five syndicate members, Mr Gordon Turner,
49, Mr John Ferguson, 43, Mr Donald McVean, 34, Mr Richard Syme, 43, and
Mr Owen Kelly, 34, discovered they had a winning line. However, 48 hours
later, when they telephoned Littlewoods in Liverpool, they discovered
there was no trace of the coupon.
When he appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh three weeks ago,
Baxter, in his final year of a BA honours degree in business studies at
Stirling University, admitted forming a fraudulent scheme to obtain
pools stake money and appropriate it to his own use.
He admitted inducing various people in Stirling to hand over completed
coupons and stake money totalling #216, embezzling the cash and failing
to deliver the stakes and coupons to Littlewoods. He took the stake
money because he had got into financial difficulties after his car was
stolen.
His solicitor, advocate Vincent Belmonte, told Lord Ross Baxter
depended during the summer holidays last year on the #35 a week he made
as a pools collector. He had done the job for two years and never
believed anyone would have a win when he took the money. Nevertheless he
kept the coupons naively thinking that if anyone did win he could hand
them to Littlewoods and they would pay out.
He added: ''When the matter was investigated he was able to produce
the coupon and was absolutely shocked when Littlewoods said they would
not honour it.''
Later, syndicate member John Ferguson, of Dunipace, said: ''We are now
ready to do battle in the courts . . . We want the whole #2.3m. That's
what they owe us, nothing less.''

A BOY of five walked back through the gates of his school yesterday
with no sign of his cheeky grin.
Shaun Murray's father, Steven, said: ''I think he realises how
important it is to behave.''
His son was expelled nine days into his first term because of his
boisterous behaviour.
Teachers Trinity Primary School, Edinburgh, told Mr Murray that they
could not cope with his disruptiveness, and said his constant talking
and refusal to sit in his seat was affecting the education of his 32
classmates.
Shaun suffers from a lack of concentration and deep-rooted behavioural
problems.
Mr Murray, 31, of Leith, criticised the school after its action. He
claimed staff had been informed of Shaun's problems and had promised
special care from an auxiliary teacher.
Yesterday, after education officials from Lothian Regional Council
agreed to Mr Murray's demands to have his son admitted again under
constant one-to-one supervision, Shaun was far from pleased. He said:
''I'd rather be at home playing with my toys.''
Mr Murray said: ''After all the fuss we have been through Shaun has
decided he doesn't like school after all.
''The day after he was expelled he was upset that he couldn't go to
school, so I told him I was keeping him off because he had a bad cold.
''This morning he kept coughing and told me he thought he should have
another day at home until he was feeling better.''
Shaun's first day back at school went well.
Mr Murray said: ''It will take him a while to settle down properly,
but there were no real problems.''

THE SNP was celebrating a breakthrough last night in getting its
message on to television screens south of the Border, when the BBC
agreed to carry live on the network next week the conference speech of
leader Alex Salmond.
In an agreement which lays to rest the Panorama controversy of earlier
this year, the SNP has also called off its legal challenge on the way
broadcasters treat Scottish politics.
This follows progress made at a private meeting in July between BBC
chairman Marmaduke Hussey and Mr Salmond and his party's broadcasting
spokeswoman, Ms Roseanna Cunningham.
Live coverage of the SNP conference in Perth will begin at 2.15pm next
Friday, taking in Mr Salmond's address before breaking for the three
o'clock news. The BBC will then go over live to the Plaid Cymru
conference to screen the speech of Welsh nationalist leader Dafydd
Wigley.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell and his Plaid Cymru counterpart
met senior executives of both Independent Television News and the BBC in
London yesterday and emerged to announce the live BBC package next week.
The agreement harks back to the controversy earlier this year
involving a Panorama interview with the Prime Minister in the week of
local authority elections in Scotland. This outraged Opposition parties
north of the Border and left BBC Scotland executives embarrassed by the
intransigence of their London counterparts, who were eventually
prevented from screening the interview by an interdict granted in the
Court of Session.
That successful court move by Labour and the Liberal Democrats was not
joined by the SNP, which instead said it would seek a judicial review of
the whole question of London-based coverage of politics. Now that action
is being dropped, Mr Russell said yesterday.
''Our application for judicial review is being halted,'' he said.
''That is a reflection of the discussions we have had and assurances we
have been given at the highest level that they recognise that mistakes
have been made in the past that will not be made in the future.''
He added: ''We have been having discussions with both the BBC and ITN
today, laying down substantial markers for the future, and in particular
for the General Election. There is a long way still to go, but we are
pleased that this month there will be an indication that the BBC network
has started down that road.''
* Journalists from Asia, the Middle East and Europe attended a
briefing for the London and overseas press yesterday at which the SNP
launched its conference agenda. They were told by Mr Salmond that the
conference would help define Scottish politics in the run-up to the
General Election.

BRITAIN emerged as the delinquent of Europe yesterday with the
greatest number of car thefts and one of the highest prison populations.
The survey of European Union countries, published by the European
Commission in Brussels, also found the French are the hardest drinkers,
the Greeks the heaviest smokers and the Irish the hardest workers.
The figures show there are more people in jail in the UK (46,350) than
anywhere else in the EU apart from France (49,323) and there are also
more sex offences per capita here than anywhere else apart from Holland
and Germany.
However, Britons can pride themselves on being comparatively sober.
They drink about nine litres of pure alcohol a year per head, compared
with 14.8 litres in France.
The survey says women can expect to out-live men everywhere, but does
not explain why life expectancy for males is lowest in Portugal (70.7
years) and highest in Sweden (75.4).
The average life expectancy in Britain is 73.6 for men and 79 for
women. But all the EU figures lag behind Japan where men can expect to
live to 76.1 years and women to 82.2.
The Germans have the most holidays in Europe, an average of 30.8 days
plus 14 statutory days off. The Irish have the least at 20 days with
eight statutory days, followed by the UK with an average of 25 days and
eight statutory days.
Car theft is most rife in Britain, with 977 cases per 100,000 people,
compared with just 32 car thefts per 100,000 in Ireland. Only Sweden
comes close to the UK figure, with 879 cases.
Holland has the worst record for sex offenders, with 64 sex crimes per
100,000 people followed by Germany, with 60, and the UK with 57.

TRADERS in Edinburgh's historic Old Town were yesterday told they
could boost business by sprucing up their shopfronts.
A joint drive between Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (LEEL) and
Edinburgh Old Town Renewal Trust aims to upgrade the area between
Waverley Station and Chambers Street, which attracts thousands of
visitors every year.
Both groups believe high-quality, well-designed shopfronts will not
only raise traders' profit margins but will encourage others to invest
to attract more visitors.
LEEL has set aside #250,000 for the project and additional funding
will be provided via the Old Town Renewal Trust, which will administer
the programme, providing advice and assistance with design and planning
procedures.
The level of financial assistance for each applicant will vary
depending on the scale and nature of the refurbishment, but shop-owners
could find up to two-thirds of the total cost will be covered, said
organisers.
Owners and tenants heard that a survey showed existing businesses that
had upgraded their frontage had seen sales rise by as much as 20%.

<TEXT>
A DEFICIT of #26,000 for the fringe at the 1993 Royal National Mod at
Airdrie -- widely quoted during a recent industrial tribunal in
Stornoway -- was wrong. The actual loss was only #5437, fringe director
Billy Kelly said yesterday.
The tribunal involved the dismissal of the director of An Comunn
Gaidhealach, Mr Donald Maclean, from his #20,000 a year job.
Mr Maclean won his case but was held 65% to blame for his dismissal.
He had claimed that he had no responsibility for the fringe, saying Mr
Kelly was responsible.
Mr Kelly said he was available for the duration of the tribunal but
was not called as a witness for An Comunn, so had been unable to comment
until now.
He said: ''During the tribunal it was stated that the deficit for the
fringe in Airdrie was #26,300, which is completely at odds with the
audited accounts which show #22,294.
''If previous practice and custom had been adhered to and all income
to the fringe properly accounted for . . . then the deficit for the
Airdrie fringe would have been #5437 and not the #26,300 as widely
quoted.''
He said that the presentation of budget had been sent to head office
in Stornoway for approval more than six months before the event itself.
Mr Maclean said he had no comment to make.

MR Allan Stewart, fined #200 this week after admitting breach of the
peace in a confrontation with M77 extension protesters, has told The
Herald he believes the conviction will not affect his chances of
retaining his Eastwood parliamentary seat.
The former Industry Minister also said in his first interview since
the court appearance that he did not feel his law and order credentials
had been damaged.
''I pleaded guilty to amended charges. I broke the law inadvertently
and was fined. That was the fact of the matter, not just for me but for
anybody and I accept that,'' he said.
''I do not believe my standing has been damaged and the feedback I
have received confirms that.''
Mr Stewart has already set out to regain any ground lost during the
time leading up to his court appearance when he, necessarily, kept a low
profile.
Last night, he faced a large Conservative audience at Clarkston Hall,
sharing a question time with leading Tory figures Annabell Goldie,
Jackson Carlaw, and Adrian Shinwell.
Of the M77 incident he says: ''The motorway extension is crucial to my
constituency. It was the one thing, above all, I promised my
constituents that the Conservative government would do if elected.
''Without it my constituency would have eventually become one huge
traffic jam. It was also crucial for Ayrshire, supported by every
Ayrshire MP, and it was Labour-controlled Strathclyde Regional Council
who were prime movers behind the M77 extension.''
Mr Stewart says he will certainly go back to the scene of the
roadworks if the need arises. He admitted that he had been only vaguely
aware in February that he might fall foul of the protesters.
With hindsight, he now agrees he should have left the scene more
quickly. He was, however, very surprised when he was charged.
''I feel no bitterness towards these protesters because I do not feel
bitter about anyone. What was important to me about this was that none
of them was a constituent. Not one was from Eastwood.''
The support from his constituency party, is, he believes, unwavering,
although he concedes that, in common with other Scottish Tories, he has
a serious fight on his hands for political survival at the General
Election.

<TEXT>
HEALTH authorities in Eire last night intensified doubts about claims
made by a Catholic priest which sparked an Aids alert.
Ireland's Eastern Health Board, covering a region where up to 80 young
men were said to be under threat of Aids in seven towns and cities after
being deliberately infected by a woman, reported no evidence to back up
allegations made by Father Michael Kennedy.
Father Kennedy shocked members of his congregation when he listed the
charges at a Mass in St Mary's Church, Dungarvan, in County Waterford,
last Sunday.
He told them the 25-year-old woman had acted in a spirit of revenge
after contracting the disease from a boyfriend.
The priest said yesterday his disclosures had been ''blown out of all
proportion''.
They prompted an Aids scare in a number of neighbouring Irish
counties, while being quickly disputed by doctors and health officials.
In a statement issued at its Kilkenny HQ, the health board said it had
''no evidence to date to verify any of the allegations concerning HIV or
Aids cases in Dungarvan''.
The statement continued: ''Having checked with Irish and UK
laboratories, we can confirm there has been no documented increase in
HIV infection or Aids in the south-east (of Ireland) in the past year.
''There has been no increase in attendance at the Sexually Transmitted
Diseases clinics in Waterford, Cork or Dublin. General Practitioners
have reported no increase in people presenting themselves.''
The board also said Father Kennedy, an Irish-born member of Amrica's
Kennedy political dynasty, had still to meet its officials to hand over
any information he might possess.
Irish Health Minister Michael Noonan repeated a call for Father
Kennedy to present all the information he had to the authorities.
He too stressed there was no proof that his claims were true.

A TOUGH talking Cabinet strategy meeting at Chequers yesterday was
thrown off balance by a leaked version of top-level fears over education
and employment.
A draft of what Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard
intended to say went a good deal further than the Prime Minister wanted
out in public.
His deputy, Mr Michael Heseltine, broke off from the all-day meeting
-- the most comprehensive review of Tory policy for two decades -- to
try to limit the damage of the outspoken words of Mrs Shephard in a
draft presentation leaked to the Labour Party.
Mr Heseltine described it as ''inaccurate'' and ''politically
motivated''. But he could not deny the guts of the draft.
In it she claims:
* education should be a success story for the Government; instead
Labour is 30% ahead on the issue in public opinion.
* the Job Seeking Allowance (scheduled for next autumn) is going to be
difficult to introduce on time and almost impossible if resources are
inadequate.
* insufficient resources threaten the provision of education in the
state school sector, including grant maintained schools.
* any reduction in the quantity of higher education and its cost would
put a whole segment of middle class youngsters against them, losing
their votes and those of their parents.
It sounded like a bid for more spending in view of the fact that
education is one of Mr Major's top priorities, and Mr Heseltine could
not deny it.
''She made the point about resources,'' he said. ''She is a spending
Minister. There has never been a spending Minister who doesn't talk
about resources.'' Nor could the deputy Prime Minister deny the point
about Labour being 30% ahead on education. ''I think that we are fully
aware that public opinion polls have not been favourable for this
Government.''
Mr Heseltine, with a glum-faced party chairman, Dr Brian Mawhinney,
sitting next to him in the briefing room of the Bernard Arms, claimed
Mrs Shephard did not prepare the draft and the words in it were not used
by her when she was addressing the Cabinet.
''What matters is what she said to the Cabinet and I was there and
heard what she said. This is a travesty of the report that Gillian
actually made and it was politically motivated,'' he said.
Mrs Shephard said later in a statement: ''The reports I have seen bear
no relation whatsoever to the presentation I made to the political
Cabinet this morning.''
She added: ''Attempts by the Labour Party to rubbish our achievements
and invent divisions within the Government on the basis of these reports
will not wash.''
The Labour Party, however, was delighted by the irritation caused by
the leak and the wrong-footing of Mr Major's much vaunted strategic
meeting.
A statement from Mr Major indicated that his Cabinet has got no closer
to squaring the circle of public expenditure and tax cuts. ''The
discussion today underlined our determination to deliver effective and
well managed public services -- intensifying our efforts to limit waste
and prune unnecessary expenditure as we pursue our continuing objective
of lower taxes.''
This was a good deal more cautious than his previous statements on tax
cuts -- ''it's not a case of if, but when''.
Yesterday the key topics were education, welfare, the economy, and law
and order.
The Cabinet plans on them, however, were being kept under wraps until
the Tory Party conference next month.
It was clearly Mr Major's intention to use the Chequers meeting to
wrong-foot Mr Blair. But the leaking by Labour of the Shephard document,
a travesty or not, left the Prime Minister as the one who has been
wrong-footed.

<HEADLINE>District to foot #1m bill for flood prevention</HEADLINE>

DISTRICT councillors in Paisley have decided to double their spending
on flood prevention after a consultants' report into the cause of last
year's problems.
Almost #1m will now be spent on a package that includes the creation
of a flood response team.
The report, by Babtie Consultants, confirms that a poorly maintained
and designed drainage system was unable to cope with the unusual levels
of rainfall late last year.
Hundreds of people were made homeless and millions of pounds worth of
damage caused when Paisley was hit by the heaviest rainfall for 100
years.
Following the floods original estimates for work required at the areas
most badly hit were put at #450,000.
That figure has now been revised to #600,000. Councillors have also
been told that remedial work required to prevent any future recurrence
in the Linwood area will total about #200,000. A further #110,000 will
have to be paid in professional fees.
Although flood prevention is the responsibility of Strathclyde
Regional Council, the region has said it has neither the time nor the
money to tackle flood prevention before it is disbanded next year. In
Paisley the work is being commissioned and paid for by Renfrew District
Council to protect its own housing stock.
The Paisley South MP, Mr Gordon McMaster, said the shake-up of local
government was causing continuity problems in preparing flood prevention
measures. ''When you consider this should really be done by the regional
authorities, then the district council has done very well indeed,'' he
said.
Paisley North MP Irene Adams said the announcement would provide peace
of mind for residents in Paisley's Ferguslie Park. ''It is a positive
step because clearly our greatest fear was that there would be no flood
prevention measures in place before the winter.''

TWO men were found guilty yesterday of taking part in an inventive
fraud involving the world's first home-made, high street cashpoint
machine.
The fake but highly convincing Halifax Building Society ''Card Cash''
dispenser enticed scores of people.
They little realised that during their attempts to withdraw cash their
account details and PIN identity numbers had been secretly recorded by a
gang, who used the information to withdraw more than #120,000 with
counterfeit cards.
Graham Moore, a 31-year-old computer course student and one of the
ringleaders of the swindle, was convicted with mortgage broker Anthony
Hodges, 37, a father of two, of conspiring to defraud banks, building
societies, and other financial institutions.
They were both remanded in custody for reports until September 29 when
they will be sentenced with Moore's brother Stephen, who admitted the
offence.
Southwark Crown Court heard that the gang's plot was the first of its
type in this country.
The cashpoint machine, complete with Link and Delta card signs, was so
well designed and made that it initially fooled building society
officials.
Mr Martin Field, prosecuting, told the trial that the dispenser was
set up at the front of what appeared to be a mortgage broker's in Roman
Road, Bow, east London.
The premises -- with an authoritative sign claiming ''Hambro UK.
Mortgages, design mortgages, pensions. Halifax appointed
representative'' -- was kitted out with smart furniture and pot plants.
Additional gloss was provided by a couple of innocent teenage girls
duped into a spell of work experience.
The barrister said that after the machine had extracted details of a
customer's account and noted their 'PIN' number, card users were
informed their transactions could not be processed and advised to try
later.
By that time a computer had downloaded information contained in the
magnetic strip on their cards. This was then sent, via a modem, to the
gang's headquarters, which was never found. Once there, the details were
processed on to counterfeit cards.
A number of frustrated cardholders complained to a genuine Halifax
branch nearby about the problems the building society's ''other''
machine was giving.
When the conspirators realised Halifax officials had become
suspicious, they toured England and Wales plundering more than 100
accounts.
Hodges, of Waltham Abbey, Essex, was arrested at the shop premises.
His role had been that of the supposedly innocent and gullible office
manager.
Graham Moore, of Thamesmead Estate, south east London, was arrested
some days later. Incriminating documents and forensic evidence were
recovered.
Among the items recovered was a book containing the addresses of every
cashpoint machine in the UK.
He claimed he was totally innocent and blamed his brother Stephen, 41,
from Hackney, east London.

<HEADLINE>Doctors await tests before deciding on separation.  Woman gives birth to girl Siamese twins</HEADLINE>

THE mother expecting Britain's first Siamese twins for nine years last
night gave birth to two healthy daughters.
Brian and Melanie Astbury were said to be ''over the moon'' after the
safe delivery of daughters Chloe and Nicole at St Mary's hospital,
Manchester.
A hospital spokeswoman said the two girls were born at 11.09pm after
doctors performed a Caesarean section.
The Siamese twins, who are joined at the abdomen and share a liver,
weighed 12lb 9oz at birth after 36 weeks.
''Both the mother and her babies are doing very well and the husband
is over the moon,'' said a St Mary's spokeswoman.
The girls were delivered by consultant obstetrician Dr Michael Maresh,
who was aided by a team of doctors and nurses on standby to cope with
any problems with the babies immediately after the delivery.
The babies were today being looked after in a specialist unit, where a
tests will be performed to assess the girls' chances of survival and
separation.
Paediatric surgeon Alan Dickson said he hoped the children would
eventually be able to lead normal lives but warned that scans of the two
girls might not have shown all their abnormalities and problems.
He said the Astburys had been told of the difficult decisions they
might have to make in the months ahead.
Mr Dickson said: ''We feel that this pair of twins are at the better
end of the spectrum.
''But we also know, and have told the Astburys, we can't define the
extent of the abnormalities until the children are born.''
Asked about the children's chances of growing up to lead normal lives,
he said: ''I can't answer that with any degree of accuracy. Certainly it
is a possibility. We would hope that will be the end product.''
Mr Dickson said that surgeons would hope to be able to carry out a
separation operation within the twins' first year. But that would be
done only after extensive scans and tests and discussions with medical
experts in all fields.
He said Mrs Astbury, 25, and her husband Brian, 26, from Denton,
Manchester, had made clear they wanted the twins separated.
He added: ''We have discussed with them the possibility of facing
difficult decisions in the course of the next few months if the anatomy
is unfavourable.''
Mr Dickson said: ''It is possible there are other abnormalities that
have not been shown by the scan. It is our responsibility to define as
best as possible what is going in these children after the initial phase
of resuscitation.
''We would hope to separate them in the first year of life. There can
be no decision until we have all the information from various scans and
investigations.
''In general terms, the problems are the organs inside the abdomen.
These will have to be divided and shared. It is also possible there
won't be two full sets of organs.''
He said if the twins were healthy, they could enjoy a reasonable
standard of life in the months before they were separated.
Dr Maresh and Mr Dickson will disclose further details about the
twins' condition this morning.
Consultant clinical radiologist Dr Sarah Russell said: ''It is
important people realise we are only looking at the tip of the iceberg
in terms of what has been shown by the scan.
''It would appear the twins do share a liver. But we have no idea what
level of bowel may be joined and to what extent.
''There may be other abnormalities that can't be detected by the
scan.''

<HEADLINE>US deal halts Nato attacks. Peace talks hopes of end to Sarajevo siege</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>MURRAY RITCHIE, EUROPEAN EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976372019</RECORDNO>

AN astonishing breakthrough to end the siege of Sarajevo was agreed
late last night as Nato ordered a three-day pause in its bombing
campaign.
US mediator Richard Holbrooke won a pledge from Serbia's President
Slobodan Milosevic that the Bosnian Serbs would withdraw their heavy
weapons from the 12-mile exclusion zone around the capital.
The deal is understood to centre on a British initiative linking the
removal of heavy weapons with local ceasefires and commitments to
safeguard the 120,000-strong Serb population in Sarajevo.
American officials also revealed that Russia had put pressure on the
Bosnian Serbs to end the siege.
The halt to the intensive bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions was
agreed to allow an orderly withdrawal of heavy weapons. Bosnian Serb
commander General Ratko Mladic apparently agreed in principle to comply
with UN demands to remove them.
The Bosnian Serb leadership said it could not withdraw all its heavy
weapons without putting the lives of its people at risk. But after 11
hours of talks President Milosevic accepted reassurances that all
efforts will be made to ensure Bosnian government forces do not exploit
the situation. Mr Holbrooke also had talks yesterday with Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic.
Under the deal, the Bosnian Serbs also agreed to let the UN
peacekeepers open two roads into Sarajevo as well as the airport.
''Within the next 72 hours Bosnian Serbs will withdraw their heavy
weapons'' from the exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital, a senior
US administration official said.
He said Nato and the US would assess the situation after the initial
72-hour period and would grant ''an additional 72 hours if they are in
compliance.'' It was hoped the agreement might lead to a permanent halt
in the Nato assaults.
In a joint statement, Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes and UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called on all the warring
factions to observe a ceasefire.
They warned they were concerned by recent intensified military action,
particularly in central and western Bosnia, where the Muslim/Croat
federation has captured huge swathes of land amid reports of more than
40,000 Bosnian Serb refugees fleeing the area.
In Moscow, US deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met officials
in an attempt to defuse the escalating row over Nato air strikes.
UN forces would start to withdraw as soon as possible to be replaced
by a Nato peace implementation force. Command and control of the entire
operation, which could involve around 50,000 troops, would be handed to
Nato rather than the UN.
The vast majority of the forces would come from Nato countries,
including thousands of troops from America. There are plans to deploy
Russian troops around parts of Sarajevo to help safeguard the Bosnian
Serb population there.
European Editor MURRAY RITCHIE writes: Nato remained primed for more
action if its commanders reported they were not satisfied genuine
progress was being made towards a settlement of the conflict.
Alliance ambassadors were encouraged by the progress reported by Mr
Holbrooke, who was said to have told President Bill Clinton he hoped for
a political settlement by September 25.
Nato sources also privately expressed embarrassment that the alliance
was perceived internationally as having taken the side of Bosnian Muslim
and Croatian forces.
