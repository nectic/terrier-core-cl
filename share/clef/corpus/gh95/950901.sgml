* Scottish Red Cross Patron, Mary Young, 73, has worked for the
society for almost 60 years. She recounts her entry into the Red Cross.
MY mother knew a commandant at the time who had a unit in Glasgow, and
who thought she might like to start a small unit for daughters of her
friends. Things at that time were hotting up. I wasn't sure I'd like it.
But I recall my mother saying: ''I told Miss Finlay you would go.'' I
was 15. Then, along came the war.
A great many emergency hospitals including Mearnskirk, Killearn, and
Lennox Castle were set up on the periphery of Glasgow and they were
largely staffed by the Red Cross and members of the national hospital
reserves. Training was reduced to three weeks. A great many girls only
had the option of humanitarian services or working factories and being
called up. They chose the Red Cross.
I was a mobile VED at Portsmouth. Went in innocent, came out
experienced. I grew up. The youngest you could be a VED was 17 and a
half, and a lot of these girls were just out of school, some just out of
finishing schools, and they hit reality for the first time. But I never
heard anyone say ''I can't do that''.
You had to live with other people and share everything. There was
great camaraderie. You felt you were doing something for your country.
You were in the theatre, or doing routine care on the wards, or on
physio. It was risky, but it was amazing what you found you could do.
There were the odd times when people said: ''D'you think we'll ever get
home again?'' Sometimes it was the joke, ''Nighty-night, see you in the
morning if we're still here''. An awful lot of people remained in the
Red Cross after the war, others said ''Never again''.
Voluntary organisations are regarded differently than they were in my
day. I remember talking to a veteran recently, and I mentioned that the
Red Cross now provided counselling, and he said, ''What's that?'' I
can't repeat what he said when I explained. Then he added ''In my day
you just got on with it.''
You can't live in the past you must keep moving on. They say that VJ
Day will be the last big parade, and I think it will. One day our
generation will disappear. Man's inhumanity to man is appalling even in
the present day. Sometimes you think, och, I haven't done very much,
when you see what people have survived.
I've had more out of Red Cross than I've contributed. I hope it has
made me a more caring person. It's not what you can get out of Red
Cross, it's what you can bring. I've been places and done things I might
never have done. I don't regret anything.
But there are times I've been dropped right in it. You need to have
your wits about you. I was once left holding the baby. Its mother had
abandoned it. She said ''I need to go the toilet'' and I immediately
thought, someone should go with her. I'd been watching her for a few
days and I knew something wasn't quite right. But you can't patronise
people, you have to be so tactful.
''The first hour she went missing was harmless, we all had a shot of
holding the wee thing, but after two or three hours had gone by, we
called the police. They eventually found her in Leicester, four days
later. Ever since that day, when I'm asked to hold the baby, I keep one
eye on the mother. Some people have such deep problems, they just can't
cope.

AN amazing array of state-of-the-art technology coupled with the
courage and tenacity of special forces, including Britain's SAS, allowed
Nato warplanes to strike with unerring precision.
An accurate map of Bosnian Serb positions had been built up over
months by a wide variety of intelligence gathering techniques.
SAS forward air controllers were moved into the mountains surrounding
the Bosnian Serbs earlier this year to report on the movements of troops
and heavy weapons.
American spy satellites provided Nato with accurate information of
missile and radar sites, command and control centres, and even
individual tank movements.
However, the orbits of the satellites can be predicted and equipment
camouflaged to avoid detection.
Consequently, the American U-2R spy planes, which fly at altitudes of
up to 70,000ft and are much more flexible, carried out vital detection
work picking up Bosnian Serb radar transmissions.
Further information was provided by Nato jets, including RAF Harriers
and Jaguars, flying regular patrols over Bosnia and using on-board
cameras to record Bosnian Serb positions.
Over the past two months, the swathe of information has been boosted
by the American unmanned spy plane known as the Predator, previously a
top-secret project. Its television and thermal-imaging cameras can pick
up details down to a foot from up to two miles away.
But when Nato and UN commanders gave the green light for the attacks
to start, much of the targeting was down to the SAS man on the ground,
equipped with hand-held laser markers. He illuminated the targets with
laser beams, which are picked up by the attacking jets so that they can
deliver their fearsome weapon load with pinpoint precision.
Meanwhile, America's premier spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, has been
brought out of retirement after six years because it flies so fast and
high it can elude missiles over hotspots such as Bosnia.
Justin Murphy, a spokesman for Lockheed, the manufacturer, said that
US Air Force crews training to fly the SR-71 had looked at its potential
over the war-torn Balkans.
The air force officially refused to say whether SR-71s would be used
in Bosnia, but Captain Nori LaRue, of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at
Beale Air Force Base, said military strategists believe the SR-71, which
is more than 30 years old, ''would have higher survivability than other
planes in high-threat areas'' where there are surface-to-air missiles.
SR-71s were retired in 1989, even though they were the fastest,
highest-flying planes in the world, largely because of the high cost of
operating them.
Earlier this year, Congress directed the air force to prepare two
SR-71s for missions by today. A third SR-71 will be used as a trainer.
But it does not appear the Air Force will make the deadline because it
is behind schedule in training pilots to fly the SR-71.
As in the Gulf War five years ago, the alliance is again using video
clips to show its capability to wage smart, precise, high-tech warfare.
Within 24 hours of Nato bombs striking Serb targets, black-and-white
video clips were produced to prove just how accurate most of the hits
were. Alliance officials released 11 short scenes of bombing runs over
Bosnia, all of them taken by cameras aboard British, American, and
Spanish planes from which the laser-guided bombs were fired.
Minutes later the images were on television screens, beamed to the
four corners of the world from satellite transmission trucks outside
Nato's southern Europe headquarters. They went from the cockpit to the
living room in less than 24 hours.
''The clips pretty much speak for themselves,'' American Major General
Mike Short said as the lights were dimmed at a Nato briefing. Indeed,
the video footage needed little commentary.
One second a single-storey building was in the cross-hair of the
pilot's sight, the next second a streak of light arrived from the right
side of the screen and the building was gone in a silent puff of smoke.
In another ''smart bombing'', a series of one-storey buildings on the
right of a narrow country road was wiped out by precision bombs while
those on the other side of the road were left untouched. -- Reuter/AP

CRAIG Levein, the Hearts captain, believed his career was in danger
when stretchered off against Dunfermline in a Coca-Cola Cup tie at
Tynecastle on Wednesday.
However, a surgeon's verdict in Glasgow yesterday was that the
defender could be in action within two months. ''It was a tremendous
relief to hear the initial verdict,'' said Levein. ''I was concerned
that it was damage to the cruciate ligament I had suffered. That was
something I had gone through twice before, and the thought at the back
of my mind was that the surgeon might tell me that it was all over.
''At the moment he seems convinced that it was the medial ligament
which was affected, and that would mean a two-month lay-off. That is
great news for me, because I feel that I have five years left in me, and
to stop so soon would have been terrible.''
Levein, 30, reckons he could now be back in action for Hearts in
November and insisted: ''I want to be a part of this new Hearts set-up
and I know how important this is. OK, I shall be out for some time --
but that is so much better than I had feared.''
While Levein celebrated an escape from what might have been a
career-threatening injury, Everton's Duncan Ferguson was told that he
would require further surgery following a hernia operation towards the
end of last season. He faces another three months on the sidelines.

* CELTIC still await a decision on their troubled European
Cup-winners' Cup tie against Dynamo Batumi of Georgia, scheduled for two
weeks' time. UEFA officials Lennart Johanneson and Gerard Aigner were on
a fact-finding mission to the area and returned last night.
They were reporting on the situation in Georgia, Armenia, and
Azerbaijan, all fledgling members of the European Union. Last night a
spokesman for Europe's football officials said that a decision would be
announced late today.
It remains unlikely that Celtic will win their appeal to move the
match to a neutral venue, especially as two European ties took place
there last week without trouble.
* IF Rangers are not firing on all cylinders at this time, their
Champions' League rivals, Borussia Dortmund, are having an even tougher
time. After three matches of the Bundesliga, they are thirteenth with
two points.
In midweek, Borussia allowed newly-promoted Hansa Rostock to battle
back from 2-0 down to win 3-2, and coach Ottmar Hitzfeld knows he needs
to see a rapid improvement with the start of the Champions' League
looming.

THE recent Coca-Cola Cup tie between Falkirk and Aberdeen produced an
even larger crime count than was first thought.
Falkirk keeper Tony Parks was sent off for deliberate hand ball
outside the area. Referee Willie Young had earlier cautioned Falkirk's
John Clark, and he was later joined by team-mate Steve Kirk and
Aberdeen's Theo Snelders and Peter Hetherston.
However, it has emerged that yellow cards also were dished out to
Maurice Johnston and Billy Dodds, who were called into the referee's
room at the interval and booked for their part in a melee which broke
out as the teams left the field at half-time.
And after the final whistle, Falkirk captain Joe McLaughlin became the
seventh player booked after an alleged incident with Dodds as the teams
headed for the dressing rooms.
THE SFA have been given #25,000 in sponsorship from the Bank of
Scotland, with the money going to help stage a Four Nations' under-17
tournament at Forthbank Stadium later this month.
* MOTHERWELL'S teenage striker Lee McCulloch has been named in the
Scotland international youth squad for the matches against Estonia and
host nation Lithuania later this month in the European Championship.
Squad:
Anthony (Celtic), Archer (Nottingham Forest), Brebner (Manchester
United), Craig (Aberdeen), Ferguson (Rangers), Gaughan (Ipswich), A Gray
(Leeds United), D Gray (Dundee United), McCluskey (St Johnstone),
McCondichie (Celtic), McCulloch (Motherwell), McShane (Rangers),
Mathieson (Rangers), Pollock (St Mirren), Rice (St Johnstone),
Scrimgeour (St Mirren).
* TOMORROW'S Old Firm reserve game at Ibrox will kick-off at 3.0. The
rear of the Broomloan Road Stand will be open for Celtic fans with the
Govan and Copeland Stand for Rangers supporters. The Main Stand will be
closed.

THE European Rugby Cup, the ambitious new competition initiated by the
Five Nations, will kick off on October 31 and climax in a grand final on
Sunday, January 7.
Scotland and England will join the tournament next year, SRU director
of rugby Jim Telfer underlining again yesterday that Scottish
representation will be by at least two district sides and not clubs.
Last season Stirling County and Watsonians were invited to take part but
have, apparently, bowed to the SRU's wish that clubs should take a back
seat.
This year leading teams from Wales, Ireland, France, Italy and Romania
will take part, the opening two matches featuring Faru Constantza
against Toulouse in Romania and Milano against Leinster in Milan.
''This is an historic and important day for rugby in the Northern
hemisphere,'' said Fred McLeod, the Five Nations' chairman. ''Once the
tournament is established in the rugby calendar we are confident it will
have wide-ranging appeal.''
Bernard Lapasset, president of the French Federation, believes the new
tournament will be complimentary to the Five Nations' Championship, and
will help the development of club and provincial rugby throughout
Europe.
The inaugural tournament will comprise 12 teams from five countries:
Faru Constantza from Romania, Benetton Treviso and Milano from Italy,
Toulouse, Castres and Begles from France, Munster, Ulster, and Leinster
from Ireland, and Cardiff, Pontypridd, and Swansea from Wales.
In the opening stages, each team will play two matches in a designated
pool, with the four top-placed sides going through to the semi-finals on
December 30. The final, provisionally arranged for Cardiff Arms Park,
will take place on Sunday, January 7.
Pool A -- Toulouse, Benetton Treviso, Faru Constantza. Pool B --
Cardiff, Ulster, Begles. Pool C -- Pontypridd, Milano, Leinster. Pool D
-- Castres, Munster, Swansea.

THE Coca-Cola Cup finalists of last season went at one another again
last night in the same competition, but this time the more seasoned
premier division club survived.
It was, however, another dramatic encounter and one which left Raith
Rovers' manager Jimmy Nicholl shaking his head in despair at what he
considered to be Celtic's poor sportsmanship.
Celtic, beaten on penalties in last November's final, took the lead
when Pierre van Hooydonk scored his second goal against Raith Rovers in
five days -- the Parkhead side won 1-0 in the league at Stark's Park on
Saturday -- but the Kirkcaldy side equalised with a stunning goal from
Tony Rougier.
The third-round tie then careered on into extra time and just when it
seemed as though penalties would be required again, Simon Donnelly
scored a minute from the end of overtime.
However, Nicholl was saddened by another incident in the closing
stages, claiming Celtic's behaviour at a throw-in corrupted the spirit
of the game.
Raith's keeper, Scott Thomson, had kicked the ball out of play when he
saw Celtic's Peter Grant lying in agony, suffering from cramp, and after
the midfield player had been treated, Rudi Vata took the throw-in and
hurled the ball into Raith's territory where van Hooydonk nodded the
ball into touch instead of allowing a Raith player to take possession.
''This put us under pressure in one of our corners of the pitch, and I
thought it was poor sportsmanship,'' said Nicholl. ''If this sounds like
sour grapes, then it's too bad. I was disappointed by the manner in
which we lost. Nevertheless, we have had some good fun in the Coca-Cola
Cup, and it has given us a wee run in Europe.''
Thomson was under instructions not to say too much about the incident,
but he did point out: ''You can take it I won't be kicking the ball out
of play again.''
After an impressive start, when they surged forward in numbers, it
appeared as though Celtic were intent on sweeping Raith off the pitch in
retaliation for their audacity in the cup final last season, and the
vast majority of the 27,546 supporters were enjoying the spectacle.
Eventually, however, Raith, with Shaun Dennis and David Sinclair
immense at the heart of their defence, started to push forward
themselves, and Celtic discovered the evening would not be
straightforward.
It was Celtic's first competitive match back in their own stadium
since their impressive new stand was completed, but their early promise
did not intimidate their Stark's Park opponents. ''I don't know if we
contributed in a footballing sense,'' said Nicholl, but as always, they
did.
The first half saw Celtic trying desperately hard to break the
deadlock, but a post and some sterling defensive play denied Andreas
Thom and his team-mates, and even after van Hooydonk had scored in 51
minutes, Raith still refused to roll over. The Dutchman's goal was
scored after Thom had been brought down by Sinclair 22 yards out.
Both van Hooydonk and John Collins, who was watched by Viv Anderson,
the right-hand man of Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, stood over the
ball, but the former took the shot and sent the ball curling over the
defensive wall and into the net. Thomson managed to get a hand to the
shot, but could not prevent the goal.
On the hour, three changes were made. Celtic took off Thom who had
taken a knock in the first half, and sent on Walker, while Raith
withdrew McInally and Dair whose places were taken by Graham and Wilson.
Then at the opposite end, in 77 minutes, Gordon Marshall was given
absolutely no chance of reaching Rougier's shot.
Donnelly, a substitute for Brian McLaughlin, used a hand 25 yards from
his own goal, and from the free kick, Raith's Trinidad and Tobago
internationalist smacked the ball into Marshall's top left-hand corner.
The game staggered towards extra time, and after a fairly lifeless
first 15 minutes of overtime, legs began to tire rapidly. Penalties
loomed and Celtic's fans must have felt haunted by memories of the cup
final when Paul McStay's miss from the spot allowed Raith to take the
cup.
In the closing seconds, though, Raith lost possession deep in their
own half, van Hooydonk sent in a cross from the right, substitute Andy
Walker got a touch on the ball and when Thomson was able only to parry
the ball, Donnelly pounced.
It was all over. Although the scorer of the winning goal was honest
enough to admit that he had not played particularly well, he was
understandably happy with his first goal in 16 months.
''I am delighted to get through,'' said Celtic manager Tommy Burns,
''but it's difficult to understand how we can make life so hard for
ourselves.'' On the incident which had annoyed Raith, he said: ''I don't
think there was a deliberate intention to indulge in bad
sportsmanship.''
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, Hughes, Grant, O'Donnell,
McLaughlin, van Hooydonk, Thom, Collins. Substitutes -- Donnelly,
Walker, Bonner.
RAITH ROVERS -- Thomson, Kirkwood, Broddle, McInally, Dennis,
Sinclair, Rougier, Cameron, Crawford, Lennon, Dair. Substitutes --
Graham, Coyle, Wilson.
Referee -- L Mottram (Forth).

SCOTLAND'S Peter Nicol, the No.3 seed, reached the quarter-final stage
of the Hong Kong Open yesterday when he defeated Paul Johnson, of
England, 15-10, 13-15, 15-10, 15-11, setting up an intriguing match
against No.5 seed Chris Walker.
As expected, world champion Jansher Khan had little difficulty against
Mark Chaloner, beating the Englishman in straight games as a typhoon
raged outside.
Organisers were given the go-ahead by local authorities to play the
second-round matches on the condition that spectators would not be
allowed into the arena during Typhoon Kent, which lashed the territory
from late morning.
''I played better than in the first round,'' said Khan. ''My short
game has picked up and I was taking my volleys better.'' He now has a
quarter-final match against Del Harris, who defeated Mark Cairns in four
games.
Australia's Ronney Eyles, the No.2 seed, was given a tough work-out by
Federico Usandizaga, of Argentina, before winning.

GARY Armstrong, the Jed-Forest Scotland and Lions scrum half, will not
be the only long-term casualty on the comeback trail at Riverside Park
tomorrow. Jed's guests in the Tennents premiership second-division
match, GHK, will field a complete back row of returning absentees --
Murray Wallace, Andy Ness, and Derek Busby.
Even a few weeks ago, the odds would have been astronomically long
against such a trio coming together. Ness has missed the past two
seasons because of a career-threatening knee injury, Wallace has played
little rugby in that time, and the best of Busby, the Scotland under-21
captain all of nine years ago, seemed to have long passed. But they have
won through to the doubtful honour of trying to keep Jed's irrepressible
scrum half in check.
Armstrong, who was out of rugby for all of last season because of knee
damage, returns full of renewed enthusiasm.

GHK introduce their South African recruit, Cecil du Plessis, at lock,
and other Southern Hemisphere players, mainly New Zealanders, pop up all
over the place.
Watsonians could even have an all New Zealand front row against Gala
if they opt for Stuart Mather, Si Farland, and Mike Stanaway from their
nominated squad. Mather, whose brother Cameron also is in the squad, and
Farland are newcomers to Scottish rugby.
Similarly, two of their compatriots, Craig Foster and Keryn Martin,
both from Wellington, make debuts for Ayr against Wigtownshire. Two
more, Dean Sheppard and Chad Eagle, have been introduced in the Currie
XV to meet Kelso, and yet another, Darren Lloyd, has his first run for
Boroughmuir at lock against Edinburgh Academicals at Meggetland.
Boroughmuir have omitted Bryan Easson, the North and Midlands fly
half.
Instead, his district colleague, Andy Knight, has been switched from
scrum half to stand-off, his role in the Dutch Euro Cup tournament in
Leiden earlier this month.
Murray Fraser, the former Highland and Edinburgh Academical centre now
playing scrum half, and John Manson, who was capped last season while he
was with Dundee, make league debuts for Stirling County in the start of
their championship defence against Hawick at Bridgehaugh. But not one of
the three Craig brothers is in the Hawick XV.
Richie and Mark, formerly with West, and James, the Scottish Schools'
exciting wing last season, experience the harsh reality of having to
play junior rugby to see whether they can make the grade.
Heriot's have five newcomers in the team to meet Melrose, though all
are home grown -- Phil Smith from Dunfermline, Anthony Glasgow from GHK,
David Officer from Edinburgh University, Fraser McMillan from
Musselburgh, and Tam McVie from Edinburgh Academicals.
Two of the Redpath brothers, Bryan and Andrew, are back in the Melrose
team. Craig Joiner resumes after injury.
LEEDS full-back Alan Tait has been named captain of Scotland's side
for the Emerging Nations section of the Halifax Centenary World Cup.
Tait, who has won 14 Great Britain rugby league caps, represented
Scotland eight times at rugby union before turning professional.
''To be asked to lead my country is one of the biggest honours of my
career,'' he said. ''It is the equal of being chosen for Scotland at
rugby union and being picked for Great Britain at rugby league.''
Leeds' football co-ordinator Hugh McGahan said he felt Scotland had
made a wise choice. ''Alan is very experienced and I feel he will rise
to the occasion,'' he said. ''Becoming a dual international is a very
big honour for him.''

EDINBURGH Academicals, who yesterday renewed their commercial
partnership with Glenmorangie for the sixth successive year, will have a
trust fund in place for their players this season.
Accies, fresh from their 96-0 victory over the Swedish national side
last weekend, begin their premiership challenge against Boroughmuir at
Meggetland tomorrow, and yesterday, club president Charlie Jackson
declared that despite the recent loss of top players, they still had
managed to retain a top three placing last season.
Jackson, who also revealed that Academicals would soon appoint a
commercial manager, said that the trust fund established this season
would not provide salaries for players, but would go some way to
providing a form of recompense.
The club has attracted a number of players to Raeburn Place for the
current season, including George McKinlay (Edinburgh University), Aidan
Dow (GHK), Ross Barber (Scottish Schools), Kevin Troup (London Scottish)
-- who remains from the tail end of last season -- Colin Allan (Dundee
HS FP) and Duncan Graham (Edinburgh Wanderers).
In addition, Duncan Wilson and Malcolm McVie have re-enlisted at
Raeburn Place and it was also revealed yesterday that 1990 Grand Slam
captain David Sole will augment his Raeburn Place coaching duties with
managership of a new under-21 squad.
* GALA have enlisted three overseas players -- Mark Stumbles, a
25-year-old centre from Dunedin, New Zealand, and two South Africans,
lock Matthys Stoltz and scrum half Arnoldus van Rwooyen.
Stumbles, who has played for Otago B, was at Netherdale last night for
the official announcement of the club's three year sponsorship agreement
with McEwan's, though he is not in the Gala team to meet Watsonians
tomorrow.

A FRUSTRATING day for the Scots seeking qualification for the British
team for the 1996 Olympics was highlighted at Weymouth yesterday on a
two-man 470 class course as Helensburgh's Andy Richards and Ian Park led
to the first mark after their only start of the day only to have the
race abandoned as the breeze supposedly faded.
''It was especially annoying not just because we were in front but
because, though it was a light wind, it was probably the most settled
direction we've this week,'' said Richards.
It was a waiting day for seven of the nine classes as the land breeze
refused to give up to the preferred sea breeze forecast for mid
afternoon. In the Laser class, only Mark Littlejohn (Sussex) managed to
master the very shifty unsettled breeze to win, while both of his top
three rivals failed even to break into the top eight places.
Youth Champion Ben Ainslie leads but Littlejohn still carries a
twenty-fourth place in his score which he will be able to discard after
nine races.
In the Teacher's Round Britain Challenge Jon Fitzgerald's Scots crew
lost out to Ireland's David Hart overnight and now lie second with a
three-mile deficit. Results:
Olympic sailing trials results:
Laser class: Race 8 -- 1, M Littlejohn (Lancing); 2, A Oddie

ALAIN Prost smiled with satisfaction yesterday after having completed
a second day of testing for British Formula One team McLaren at
Silverstone.
The former world champion driver, in his first serious F1 run since
the death of Ayrton Senna, sped round 42 laps of the circuit and said he
had thoroughly enjoyed the drive. However, he would not be drawn on his
plans for the future, despite suggestions he was poised to make a racing
return next year.
''When I started I had a strong feeling and some emotions because
being with this team is like being with my family again,'' said Prost.
''I am quite pleased about it all, especially my physical condition, and
the car is better to drive than I thought it would be.''
Prost is undecided about his plans for next season, but has indicated
he will not race in F1 unless the conditions are perfect for him to win
grand prix races and challenge for the championship.
''In order to race next year I will have to be in a 100% situation,''
said the Frenchman. ''I need to be very confident and comfortable and
that means I need a good car, good engine, big motivation, and a lot of
support from the team and sponsors,'' he said.
''If there are any of these things missing, you cannot do it. I have
no contract with McLaren. I will just do the tests on a free basis and
that is the most comfortable situation for me. I want to help.''

BERLIN'S historic stadium, where Hitler avoided presenting Olympic
gold to Jesse Owens, because he confounded his Aryan doctrine, will be
the venue tonight for a jackpot meeting, in which three black sprinters
-- Linford Christie, Michael Johnson, and Gwen Torrence -- are among
five athletes chasing athletics' biggest prize: #165,000 in gold
bullion.
Owens, who won four Olympic golds in 1936, ended his career pursuing
security by racing horses, dogs, and motor bikes. But tonight five
athletes: Christie, Johnson, Torrence, Sonia O'Sullivan (Ireland, 5000m)
and Natalia Shikolenko (Belarus, javelin) have the chance to assure
their futures with victory in the last so-called Golden Four meeting.
Winners in all four matches share 20 one-kilo gold bars.
Christie, too-miraculously recovered from his world championship
collapse, faces world champion Donovan Bailey, Mike Marsh, Jon Drummond,
and Frankie Fredericks.
The forecast wet-and-cold conditions will not help O'Sullivan, who
meets world record holder Fernanda Ribiero, and Yvonne Murray, in a
5000m world record attempt.
Murray will decide after this whether to face fellow Scot Liz McColgan
in a half-marathon debut in the Great North Run a fortnight on Sunday.
McColgan, meanwhile, has confirmed she will contest 10,000m races in
Edinburgh and Portsmouth next month.
Mel Neef has secured a lane in the Berlin 400m, but Tom Hanlon, who
clocked 7-56.71 in a flat 3000m last week, has failed to gain inclusion.
Meeting director Rudi Thiel said that he has arranged a meeting over
5000m between world record-holder Haile Gebreselassie and Kenya's 3000m
steeplechase world record-holder, Moses Kiptanui.

SCOTLAND'S Dale Reid shot an opening three-under-par 69 to finish two
strokes off the lead in the Wilkinson Sword English Open at The
Oxfordshire Club yesterday, then announced she was heading for the
United States. Reid has entered for the preliminary test at Mission
Hills in California next week when she will attempt to earn a place at
the qualifying school for the LPGA Tour.
''I still believe that I can win again and I want to get my record
number of wins back from Laura Davies. Going to America will set me
another goal,'' she said.
She added: ''I feel that my game has become stagnant. In America the
weather makes for more consistent conditions and I want to prove to
myself that I can still play golf.
''To do that I need to play more tournaments. Ideally I would like to
become an international member of the LPGA like Laura (Davies) and
divide my time between America and Europe.''
Reid three-putted three times in her 69 which also included a penalty
drop from water at the eleventh. But there were six birdies.
The leader is Wendy Dicks from Essex, whose 67 is her best start in
three years on the Tour. She is one ahead of Lancashire's Diane Barnard,
who had three 2s in four holes from the short fifth which she followed
with eagles at the par-4 sixth and eighth holes where, in turn, she
holed a wedge and No.6-iron second shots. Leading scores (British or
Irish unless stated):
67 -- W Dicks.
68 -- D Barnard.
69 -- D Reid, F Dassu (Italy).
70 -- K Speak, C Louw (S Africa), M Bertilskold (Sweden), S Mendiburu
(France), J Morley, C Hjalmarsson (Sweden), P Grice-Whittaker.
Others included: 72 -- L Davies. 0 73 -- M McKinlay. 74 -- J Forbes, L
Irvine. 75 -- T Craik, G Stewart. 77 -- C Panton-Lewis. 81 -- J Kinloch.

SCOTLAND coach Jim Love watched Stenhousemuir seamer Graeme Gardner
bowl the B team to victory yesterday, then admitted: ''He was only my
sixth choice pace bowler.''
Gardner ripped the heart out of Yorkshire Cricket Academy's batting
line-up to give the Scots victory by 147 runs in the three-day match at
Bradford.
Iain Philip's side set up their win with a brisk batting show during
the morning session. Grange batsman Cordon McGurk top-scored with 87,
including eleven 4s, and he had fine support from Carlton's Jim Govan,
who hit 61.
But once again Ayrshire's Drew Parsons stole the show with a thrilling
knock of 48 in double-quick time to let Philip declare at lunch, leaving
the Tykes 300 to win. Scoreboard:
Scotland B 259 for seven decl and 245 for four decl (G.McGurk 87,
J.Govan 61, D. Parsons 48); Yorkshire Cricket Academy 205 for four decl
and 152 (Z Morris 41; G Gardner 5-30). Scotland B won by 147 runs.

MONICA Seles' comeback remained on course at Flushing Meadow yesterday
when she easily accounted for Erika de Lone 6-2, 6-1 in the second round
of the US Open.
Seles, the two-time champion, so tight in her first match in New York
that she had to massage her face to loosen up, appeared more relaxed
before a large and encouraging Stadium Court crowd.
''I wasn't even 20% as nervous this time,'' said Seles. ''The only
thing that was bothering me was the wind.''
After a tentative start, Seles began swinging away later in the match
and produced 21 winners with her powerful two-fisted strokes, compared
to just five for her opponent.
De Lone tried to give Seles a workout and even broke the second seed's
serve once early in the first set. But three years at Harvard did not
teach the American anything she could use against the player who had
thoroughly dominated women's tennis before she was stabbed in the back
in April of 1993.
While the No.2 seed breezed into the third round, two seeds tumbled
out of the tournament. Zina Garrison Jackson had a surprisingly easy win
against No.10 seed Lindsay Davenport, while the Czech, Daniel Vacek,
eliminated the eleventh seed Sergi Bruguera 6-2, 6-3, 6-4.
Women's No.5 seed Jana Novotna lost only three games during her 6-1,
6-2 victory against Sweden's Asa Carlsson, but Kimiko Date, of Japan,
had to work hard to overcome American Lisa Raymond, Date winning 6-2,
1-6, 6-4.
Former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez made short work of
Kimberly Po, winning in straight sets, Lori McNeil, who defeated Steffi
Graf in the first round of the Wimbledon women's singles last year, lost
a last-set tie-break against Elena Makarova, and Germany's No.11 seed
Anke Huber beat the home country's Anne Miller 6-0, 7-5.
Tim Henman, Britain's sole survivor in the singles, lost in the second
round to American Jared Palmer, 6-4, 6-7 (8-10), 6-3, 6-1.

WORLD champions Australia yesterday defeated Great Britain's women 4-1
in Sydney, another blow for the tourists who have been hit by injuries
and illness.
Five Scots figured in the match. Susan Fraser, Rhona Simpson, and
Pauline Robertson started, with Diane Renilson and Susan MacDonald
making their appearance as substitutes.
The home side scored three times in the first half, with Alyson Annan
opening their account in two minutes. Then came two penalty corner
conversions by Jenny Morris, the third goal proving something of a
disaster for the British players.
Their defence were penalised with a penalty corner, and while the
umpire was explaining the award, the Australians took the corner and
scored.
The intial shot was saved by keeper Hilary Rose but she was injured in
the process and had to be taken to hospital with a neck injury.
Tina Cullen was the scorer of the British consulation goal 12 minutes
after half-time.

EASY Dollar could prove the value bet in what promises to be an
intriquing battle for today's Temple Fortune Stakes at Kempton.
The three-year-old is not the best horse in the field for this
well-contested Listed event, with the weights headed by the Group-class
Bin Ajwaad and Realities, but that pair are best ridden from behind, a
remark which also applies to the other obvious form choices Peace Envoy,
Star of Zilzal, and Lap of Luxury.
Settling that quintet will be no easy task and each will be at a
disadvantage in having to quicken from behind in what is likely to be a
moderately-run race.
They are all set to play into the hands of Paul Eddery on Easy Dollar,
who is unlikely to be challenged for the lead and will be able to
dictate his own pace.
Picking the winner of the conditions race and the fillies' event
involves a degree of guesswork, with only three of the 13 runners in
those two races having run before.
Murheb's two efforts to date make him look vulnerable, with the
Michael Stoute-trained Double Leaf the most likely candidate on
pedigree.
But in the fillies' race just over an hour later, it could pay to
stick with last month's course winner Kirov Lady, well suited by this
step up to seven furlongs.
Frankie Dettori bypasses Kempton for Haydock where he should land the
opening maiden on Double Bluff.
* SHADOW Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, The Herald's Saturday racing
columnist, will present the Ayr Gold Cup to the winning owner after the
race on Saturday, September 16.
* SAMAH, the horse responsible for twice landing hefty gambles, did it
again yesterday with a near #100,000 York coup.
His backers plunged in to force Samah's price down to 7-2 favourite
from a generally available 9-2 in the trophy race.
An estimated #94,000 in major bets was taken out of the ring, with one
bookmaker reporting an off-course bet of #2000 to win #10,000.

NON-GOLFING citizens of Aberdeen may have been baffled by the
appearance on a 40-foot banner stretched across Union Street which
proclaimed: ''Barnes is Back.'' Inquiries would have revealed that the
reference was to the Shell Scottish Seniors Open, which begins today at
Balgownie.
Yet that teaser, allied to the sponsor's television, radio, and
newspaper advertising campaign could well have ended in tears. When
Brian Barnes -- for it is he -- flew from London on Tuesday his left
leg, recently operated on for thrombo-phlebitis, had swollen.
He completed a practice round on Wednesday and then consulted a local
specialist who, after tests, was concerned at the condition of Barnes'
blood. ''It was,'' Barnes said, ''touch and go whether I would be
allowed to play or spend seven days in hospital on a drip.''
Warfarin, a form of rat poison, was prescribed to thin his blood, and
Barnes took part in the pro-am preliminary to the #100,000 event.
As it is, he has been forbidden to fly home after this event and not
before late next week to rejoin the US Senior Tour. There, the new
British champion, who is seventy-sixth on the money list, needs to make
the most of a few more invitations to finish no worse than thirty-first
to avoid the rigours of the next qualifying school.
Barnes, 50, has made a marvellous start to his new lease of golfing
life. Having won the season's most important title, he was second last
week and thus in only two outings, his earnings are #68,000 -- almost
double the amount of #35,000 he made in 1980, his most successful season
on the regular European Tour.
There will, of course, be no little competition for the #16,660 first
prize from the field of 78 playing 54 holes over the Royal Aberdeen
club's 6372-yard, par-70 links.

Mladen Grbin argues that the Nato action in Bosnia may strenghten the
cause of Serbian expansionism, and weaken the position of those opposed
to partition
THE initial surge of optimism in the wake of the Nato bombardment of
Bosnian Serb military targets may be premature, and there is already an
indication that Sarajevans are closer to reality in more ways than one.
Their experience teaches them that cautious cynicism might be a more
appropriate response. They say they have seen it all before.
Nato and the UN are very careful playing to their diverse audiences in
the theatre of war. They reassuringly point to the might,
professionalism and potential of the military alliance, while exercising
restraint, and explaining the importance of minimising collateral
damage. While this would be normally seen as referring to the civilian
population in and around the marked targets, it would appear that it may
include the operation itself, as the whole exercise contains a number of
serious risks, and a paradox.
In its initial unwillingness to show clear intent to check instability
in the Balkans, and back it up with a credible military threat, the
so-called international community is still showing symptoms of weakness,
despite robust statements, such as that of Nato Secretary General Willy
Claes. The balance between collateral damage and collateral credit is a
very fine one, and in the context of the latest action, the consensus on
to how to approach the Balkan conflict is beginning to show hairline
cracks.
Historically, the security and stability of the Balkans was perceived
to lie in maintaining the political and military structures created by
Tito, and on the principle of the Warsaw Pact and the Nato Alliance
having a shared interest in the area. In the wake of the monumental
changes in Eastern Europe since 1989, this perception became greatly
disrupted and the initial reflex was to pass the role of Yugoslavia to
its apparent successor in Belgrade, in the person of Slobodan Milosevic,
without a full appreciation of the internal political dynamics in former
Yugoslavia, and Milosevic's desire to create a Greater Serbia in its
stead.
Under an ill-advised ''stick-in-time'' policy, a substantial section
of the international community was confident that Serbia -- or Greater
Serbia -- would be able to respond to the new security and stability
demands. In the event, it has been shown that the myths, still being
perpetrated in some quarters, of the fighting ability of the Serbs,
based on the experiences of the Partisan resistance to the Nazi
occupiers and the Quisling regimes, were not a sufficient basis for this
assumption.
Nationalist fervour, initially in Serbia, and then spreading like a
bushfire throughout the region, very quickly segmenting into smaller
power centres, created a precondition for mayhem and tragedy, while the
international community did not recognise that Serbia was neither
politically nor militarily able to fill its new role. There is abundant
evidence of this in the war of attrition and territorial expansion of
the last four years which has resulted in a massive destruction of life,
of communities, the forced transfer of populations, and genocide.
A substantial part of British foreign policy, which for a long time
believed in the viability of the Serb agenda, was one of the victims.
The full consequences of such a stance on the part of the Foreign Office
are not as yet fully evident, but it would be safe to assume that in any
future, global-security arrangement Britain will be considerably
marginalised, since it is British policy that largely allowed the mayhem
in the region. Former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's forced consensus
on his European partners will have equally damaged Europe's ability to
have a collective say on foreign policy matters.
The newly-revived American resolve is driven by complex internal
issues, not least the congressional pressure on the US administration to
lift the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia and Herzegovina. It seems to be
paying off even now, as the Republican Congress leader, Bob Dole, has
already indicated that he may relax his demand for a vote in Congress
which would reverse President Clinton's veto on the matter. With the
presidential primaries in sight, the President should be content.
On the ground, however, the initial approaches of 1991 seem to have
been continued through Deputy Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke,
checking on the benefits of Nato action in Belgrade. Holbrooke is
spearheading the American initiative to achieve a peaceful solution,
where the details of the peace plan have not yet been made public. This
allows the initiative manoeuvring space, so much so that Milosevic's
proxies in Bosnia Herzegovina, Mladic and Karadzic, are now voting,
through Milosevic, at the table in Belgrade.
The Nato intervention achieved a limited success in terms of actually
hitting a number of communications and military installations. However,
it has also provided apparent leverage, primarily against the Bosnian
government and President Alija Izetbegovic, and has given President
Milosevic a pivotal role in the percentages end-game -- the partitioning
of Bosnia Herzegovina along elusive ethnic lines.
As the architect of the drive for the creation of a Greater Serbia,
Milosevic is no different from his wayward Bosnian Serb proxies, and he
will insist on contiguous Serbian territory, the borders of which have
been well marked by the blood of countless non-Serb Bosnians. The
ratification of territorial gains through well-catalogued unacceptable
methods, including genocide, also brings indicted war criminals, Radovan
Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, into the negotiating process. Mladic
now knows very well that as part of this process he has sufficient space
to barter for non-removal of the artillery besieging Sarajevo, and
therefore, even before the end of military intervention has been
declared, the political space for the Bosnian Serbs is gradually
widening. Just the opposite of what the military intervention was meant
to achieve.
A peace based on the assumption that it can be achieved through
partitioning Bosnia Herzegovina, the redrawing of maps, the acceptance
of forcible migration, and further population transfers (as may be
suggested in the case of Gorazde) is no precondition for peace but
rather for further instability, which may spill over Bosnian borders.
If any territorial rearrangement results in the Posavina region in
north-east Bosnia (presently held by the combined Bosnian and Croatian
forces, guarding the narrow corridor between eastern and western
Serb-held areas of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Srijem, with the city
of Vukovar) being more firmly seen within the borders of Serbia, this
alone would create a most dangerous precedent in tampering with
recognised frontiers. It could in fact create a far more serious problem
in the Balkans than witnessed so far, particularly if the new role
accorded to Milosevic encourages him to pursue his original expansionist
aims. The partition of Bosnia Herzegovina would also have a dangerous
potential for provoking renewed conflict between the Croat and the
Bosnian communities.
Whilst Sarajevans might welcome the short respite, their cynicism is
certainly not misplaced, and their strong sense of reality will enable
them to fight another day.

THE first nosebag of the day is usually the worst. The spirit is weak
and the flesh unwilling to handle anything but the minimum of utensils:
''The critical period in matrimony is breakfast time,'' wrote A P
Herbert of this hour when fuses tend to be short and dispositions
unsunny.
The saying goes that the way to healthy eating -- and weight control
-- is to breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a
pauper, but for many the largest meal tends to be the last when calories
are not burned and become stored as fat in the body.
Breakfasts can be a sensual experience with the first taste of food on
the tongue after eight hours free of downward traffic.
Memories of strong, true tastes of good quality produce are usually
linked to waking up in happy climes. Like my memories of the Japanese
miso and raw fish, the Gleneagles morning tray, a few farmhouse Aga
offerings, and my childhood brekkies of France with a steaming bowl of
cafe au lait into which entire halves of new baguette from the corner
patisserie spread thick with Normandy butter would be plunged and often
disintegrate.
A bowl of porridge is still the breakfast DIY panacea (notably the
ambrosian, organic Mornflake now available in Tesco); the
health-conscious might include kippers, fruit, yoghurt, skimmed milk,
juice, muesli, and honey.
The call of the heavy fry-up is heard, cocking a fierce snook at
politically-correct noshing. This ever-seasonal combination of cooked
meat, carbohydrate, and (unfortunately) oil, delivers an almost instant
burst of energy. With National Breakfast Week set to start on September
11, I went in pursuit of an energy burst and embarked on a shameless
(and sadly kipperless) festival of cholesterol.
THE MALMAISON
278 West George Street, Glasgow G2 4LL
0141 221 6401 -- (Full Scottish Breakfast #10, 7.00-10.00am)
* THEY'RE big on French pastiche here, with Directoire greeting you
through the imposing doorway, and the basement restaurant painstakingly
bistroed-out to suggest an environment that Erik Satie or
Toulouse-Lautrec might patronise.
Darkwood partitions, wall-to-wall winebottles, a rash of mirrors,
white tablecloths and simple white china stretch the point. Despite a
full house the previous night, at 7.30am I am waited on in grand
solitude but with an iffy opening of grimy cup rim, and fluff in the
milk jug, and a lone Twinings Assam tea bag yielding an anaemic fluid.
The buffet table to which your #10 offers unlimited visits is swathed
in red gingham (naturellement) and offers brie, melon slices, French
yoghurt, dried fruit and prunes (''People who have prunes for breakfast
are never late for work,'' Des Dawson once assured us), croissants,
bagels, petits pains au chocolat, and fresh fruit salad on ice.
This is a sparklingly chilled affair of strawberries, raspberries,
kiwi, pears, pithless orange segments and melon. The toast is good and
malty -- no marmalade on the table but bijou potettes of strawberry jam
by Bonne Maman -- and the fry-up respectable but nearly ruined by a
torrential salt grinder.
Black pudding, two rashers of smoked bacon, two eggs, half a tomato
and dryish Lorne sausage is despatched to a medley of chamber music,
Dixieland and ''bal musette'' accordion.
Other life begins to surface: an Englishman demands marmalade
(originally the set orange compote prepared by her French chef for the
imprisoned and sickly Mary Queen of Scots, then a ''Marie Malade'') and
businessmen are peeking over the partition talking about ''feelgood
factors''.
The temptation to buffet-freeload is mitigated by one's
conspicuousness in so doing; a single wee pot of imported French
''yaourt'' stuffed with sweetened segments and lemon rind (appropriately
termed ''zeste'') suffices to cleanse the palate before emerging into
the sunlight blinking from this otiose intimacy.
THE BALCONY
Frasers Department Store, Buchanan Street
(Breakfast #1.35, served 9.30-11am Mon-Fri, 9am-10.30 Saturdays)
* PAST the impeccably groomed make-up consultants, up the sweeping
staircase and through designer frocks to The Balcony, a self-service
restaurant on the first floor done out in standard-issue beige and
lacking natural sunlight.
Here #1.35 will buy five items from a choice of pork sausage, bacon,
black pudding, tomatoes, mushrooms, hash browns, fried egg or beans. Tea
or coffee are extra. Although I'm first in the queue, the wee mushrooms
are already looking tired under the heatlamps: but the counter staff are
cheery and helpful.
The anonymity of self-service seems to promote unseemly haste and the
shovelling can -- and does -- begin in earnest, it taking three minutes
flat to get outside of a crisp hash brown, juicy tomato, bland fried
egg, cold slice of bacon, beans, and meagre black pudding.
Perhaps I chose unwisely. It was, however, more sedate than the
public-thoroughfare format of McDonald's which at 8.20 that morning
sounded off like a munitions factory, abrasive coffee laying siege to
one's intestine, abetted by a sausage and egg McMuffin unsurpassedly
synthetic of taste).
COIA'S CAFE
473 Duke Street, Glasgow G31 (554 3822)
(Breakfast #2.50 before noon, then #2.95)
* THEY'RE quick on the draw here with a profusion of fried foodstuffs
fighting to stay on the plate. This is the genuine article in a bustling
family-run Italian cafe established 70 years ago amid flock wallpaper,
neon signs, dominant televisions, paintings, food hygiene certificates,
cigarette and Swiss chocolate sales.
It's a local landmark, filled with shoppers chowing down and elderly
ladies munching ice cream. Excavation yielded fried bread, tattie scone
(both a little heavy on the oil factor, for some an indispensable part
of the ritual), sausage, bacon, rich black pudding, beans and a cuppa.
No hunger pangs until six hours later.
THE LIVING ROOM
Byres Road (339 8511)
(Veggie Megabrekky #3.95. Noon till 5pm)
* THE meatless version at last! A new coat of brighter paint, fresh
flowers, white tablecloths and removal of the backroom bar and
wrought-iron conceits has brightened up this eatery which had always
seemed a chamber from Beauty and the Beast.
As at Great Western Road's The Bay Tree which does an excellent vegan
breakfast, the Veggie Megabrekky is available here only on Sundays when
the Living Room becomes the place for couch-tattying en masse, students
and trendies reclining in wee armchairs and sofas, with Sunday papers
provided, somnolence inhibited only by the upbeat music on the sound
system.
I toy with the toast and negotiate the oval dish laden with non-meat
goodies: a fried free-range egg, potato scone, mushrooms, a crestfallen
half tomato, leaving till last the moist and spicy fruit pudding washed
down with fresh orange juice as a sort of built-in dessert course.

THE Scottish side for the Home International matches, to be played at
Royal Portrush from September 20 to 22, yesterday was topped up to its
playing strength of 11 by the addition of Craig Watson (East
Renfrewshire) and Roger Beames (Wick). The nine others were chosen
earlier this month.
Watson, an established team member, has this season won the
Craigmillar Park Open and lost in the final defending his Mid Amateur
title. Beames, a semi-finalist in the Amateur Championship, convinced
the selectors with his runaway victory for the North of Scotland title
last weekend. Beames joins Michael Brooks and Alan Turnbull as newcomers
to the event. Team:
Roger Beames (Wick), Michael Brooks (Carluke), Stephen Gallacher
(Bathgate), Barclay Howard (Cochrane Castle), Simon MacKenzie (West
Linton), Hugh McKibbin (Troon Welbeck), Graham Rankin (Palacerigg), Alan
Reid (Barassie), Gordon Sherry (Barassie), Alan Turnbull (Innerleithen),
and Craig Watson (East Renfrewshire). Captain -- Colin Dalgleish.
Reserves -- Steven Young (Inverallochy) and Ewan Forbes (Nairn).
* JOHN Daly, the Open champion, and Laura Davies -- the longest
hitters in men's and women's professional golf -- are to meet in a Skins
game in Australia next February.
Davies has accepted an invitation to play alongside Daly, Tom Watson
and Australian Peter Senior at Sanctuary Cove, Queensland. ''We are all
playing from the same tees, so it will be a real challenge,'' said
Davies.
* GARRY Harvey won the Ben Pro-Am at Royal Burgess, Edinburgh,
yesterday with a five-under-par 63. He didn't drop a shot and carded
four birdies in six holes from the turn, as well as a birdie at the
second. Leading scores:
63 -- G Harvey (Grangemouth). 64 -- G Law (Uphall). 65 -- K Walker
(Kings Links); R Weir (Cowal), S Craig (Dunfermline). 66 -- F Mann
(Musselburgh), I Young (Braidhills), D Scott (Letham Grange). Team: 55
-- K Logan (Port Royal DR), C Bullock, S Carter, C Frood.

THE mellow fruitfulness bit is alright, it's the mists that tend to
put a dampener on the autumn season after the long bright days of
summer.
However, there's autumn magic to be found in a trip to the wonderful
world of the Findlay Clark Garden Centre. The visitor is immediately
greeted with autumn joy. I am not talking here about the helpful staff,
but the profusion of pots of the indispensible sedum Autumn Joy at the
entrance.
Autumn sedums are a really useful late flowering perennial with
attractive succulent foliage and flat heads of pink flowers. They look
great in patio containers or in borders along with the autumn flowering
crocus Lilac Wonder.
You will be spellbound also by the dazzling array of shrubs for autumn
and winter colour, and the wide range of bulbs -- all part of the Autumn
Magic seen at Findlay Clark.
Alan Docherty, the centre's buyer, says: ''Special mention this autumn
must go to the newer daffodils such as the butterfly varieties at #5.99
for 40 mixed bulbs.
''We also have lovely old fashioned hooped petticoat daffodils, which
are a miniature variety with a large trumpet and small petals at the
back. The variety Golden Bells has many flowers on one plant and is very
easy to grow in rockeries, tubs or window boxes. These sell at #1.99 for
a pack of five.''
The magic spell continues with the Christmas flowering hyacinths and
paperwhites. To be able to enjoy the warm scents and glow from these
bulbs you need to be planting up in the next three weeks or so.
This weekend Findlay Clark's is going Dutch and offering half-price
Christmas flowering Delft Blue hyacinths, planters and bulb fibre for
you to make up at home. As with other bulbs at Findlay Clark, you can
buy them loose or in packs. There are 80 varieties of miscellaneous
bulbs, 40 varieties of tulips and many kinds of miniature rockery bulbs,
including the narcissi Bridal Crown.
For the more adventurous, Findlay Clark has a choice to match the
Dutch bulb fields that include the Snakes-Head Fritillaria and the Crown
Imperial lily, as well as giant ornamental garlic and the interesting
Dogtooth violet with its pagoda shaped yellow flowers.
Daffodils come in large sacks or in cram-a-bag (three sizes), where
you can pick and mix from the stunning selection of Taylors Bulbs. These
include the fragrant variety Sir Winston Churchill, which is sure to be
a big hit next spring. For those bewildered by the choice there are
Patio tub boxes at #5.99 with six different species of dwarf bulbs --
daffs, narcissi, tulips, two hyacinths and a crocus. There are also
packs of 60 assorted tulips for #4.99.
For a splash of colour and interest on the patio this autumn and
winter you have to look beyond bulbs. What about ornamental cabbages?
These are very effective grouped together in one container.
Chrysanthemums will flower to the first frosts, and winter flowering
pansies, gentians and the blue flowers of the hardy plumbago planted
with winter foliage will brighten up the dull days to come. Six
varieties of bedding plants for winter foliage, sold in a pack, can
dispel the hangdog look your hanging basket usually has in winter.
Winter-flowering jasmine, with its yellow scented flowers, is being
sold in unmissable yellow pots in the covered section. There are golden
shrubs of euonymus Emerald'n'Gold and Emerald Gaiety at #4.99, Elaeagnus
at #8.99 and Choisya Ternata 'Sundance', and the white gold of the Aztec
Pearl.
Scented shrubs such as mahonias, and the almond-smelling viburnum can
be used to create a more fragrant garden on long evenings.
After this year's glorious summer you may also want to extend the
effect of a warmer Meditteranean or more exotic climate all year.
Findlay Clark has a range of exciting architectural plants such as the
Photonia Red Robin, elegant box trained Topiary Yew, and exotic triple
ball Juniper in the Italian cameo setting.
Some of the best sellers at Findlay Clark this summer have been the
cast aluminium furniture with a verdigris effect. Also the Jarrah
hardwood furniture from Australia. Cane suites with their more
adventurous designs and colourful fabrics have also sold well. Expect
even more choice next spring.
Remarkably successful, too, have been a solidly made Australian
flat-bed barbecue, running on gas, and costing around #300.
To go with the garden furniture people have been buying large colonial
style wood and canvas parasols to sip cool drinks under. If you want to
grab a bargain for next year then the parasol and base is reduced from
#114 to #79.95.
Alan Docherty tells me that Findlay Clark is eagerly awaiting the
arrival of bird tables from a new supplier Erin-Gardena in the next
week. There are seven styles priced between #30 and #50.
Erin-Gardena is keen to promote an interest in birds and 26,500
primary schools have registered in their Birdwatch Campaign.
That well known twitcher Bill Oddie and BBC 1's fully-booked
television programme are helping to back the campaign, which is linked
to the national curriculum Key Stage 2.
If you buy products from the Erin range at Findlay Clark you can
donate tokens to a school which can then save up for valuable
educational items, such as a computer. The centre stocks a range of
specialist peanuts, cedars, fat bells and packs of wild bird foods.
If you want to extend the pleasure from your garden right through
autumn and winter and into spring, the answer spells Findlay Clark
Autumn Magic.

The Findlay Clark Garden Centre is only ten minutes by car from
Glasgow city centre and it's easy to find. Head north on the A879
Milngavie Road, and you'll see it on your left. There's parking for 200
cars.
The garden centre -- which is more than just that -- is open seven
days a week till 7pm in the evening.
Kids are welcome. There's child-size trolleys for them to push and
dairy ice cream from Nardini in Largs at the Famous Coffee House.
As well as the festival atmosphere of the current Autumn Magic
promotion, there are shops for the horse lover, golf enthusiast, water
gardener and pet owner.
At the Stirlingshire Saddlery when they say they have everything for
the horse and rider, they do mean it. Winter clothing is arriving now
for horses and humans from one to 101 years old.
Vast selections by Musto Barbour (including blue and green wellies),
and Drize-abone are stocked. Just in is the hip American children's
outdoor clothing by Chuck Roast, in Polartec fleece, sizes from six
months. Frogs shoes are great for dog walkers as well.
The Aladdin's Cave of Golf has lots of golf paraphernalia and a wide
choice of ladies and gents clothing. For the serious buyer, a practice
net is available, to hit some balls and try out your dream clubs. All
the major brands are stocked, including Ping, Calloway and Cobra, and
the golf shop also offers a part-exchange facility.
At the moment there is up to 20% off all golf clothing, as part of the
mid season sale. For the growing number of gardeners who wish to explore
the joys of ponds and fountains there are pre-formed pools from #24.99
and a wide choice of water plants and fish to stock them with.
Tanks of fish, including goldfish, comets and koi-carp await
selection, and of course there are all the pumps and other accessories
the water gardeners need. Those looking for an interesting gift will
find all sorts of goodies among the pot plants and the gardening books.

THE Cheese Company, which is a major user of Scottish-produced milk at
its plant in Lockerbie, has been bought over by the Irish-based group
Waterford Foods in a #128m deal.
The acquisition was announced yesterday in a statement to the Stock
Exchange and has been warmly welcomed by the management of The Cheese
Company.
Jim Bell, manager of the Lockerbie Creamery which has 180 employees,
said that the activities of the two companies were entirely
complementary and he forecast a good future for the Lockerbie plant with
the prospect of milk purchases rising from the present level of 190
million litres a year to 220 million next year.
The Lockerbie plant takes 45% of its milk from farmers on direct
supply contract. The balance comes from Scottish Milk, Milk Marque and
other major milk buyers.
Mr Bell spent most of yesterday briefing employees on the implications
of the takeover. He said that the overwhelming feeling in the creamery
was one of relief. ''There has been a lot of speculation about some form
of acquisition and people are glad that the period of uncertainty is
over and we can now just get on with the job,'' he said. ''All the
employees are very, very pleased.''
Waterford Foods is Ireland's biggest dairy company and already has
substantial interests in the UK and in overseas markets. It is a major
producer of Irish Cheddar, butter and yogurts. ''By becoming part of an
international dairy company whose shares are quoted on the Stock
Exchange we will be able to grow more rapidly than if we remained
independent,'' said Jim Bell.
Customers would benefit from gaining access to a broader range of
products from Ireland and the UK, he said. Farmers would also benefit
from access to these wider markets.
''Operationally we do not expect any significant changes. We will
continue to run as a business with a strong local identity.''
The Lockerbie plant is the second biggest in the current Cheese
Company operation which encompasses five creameries throughout the UK.
Its cheese pre-packing facility as Oswestry in Shropshire is the largest
in the UK, packing 45,000 tonnes a year.
Lockerbie specialises in Scottish Cheddar, Red Leicester and Double
Gloucester cheese. It also produces whey butter, concentrates and
powder. It supplies substantial volumes of cheese and butter in packs
and portions for the retail and catering trades.
The Cheese Company underwent a #96m management buy-out from Grand
Metropolitan in 1992. It is the largest cheese supplier to the UK retail
sector and in the year to October 1, 1994, had a turnover of #291m.
Managing director Roger Davenport will join the group executive
management of Waterford Foods.
* MEANWHILE, Scottish Pride has announced a temporary shutdown of its
cheese plant at Rothesay so that milk supplies can be diverted to the
liquid market. The company has experienced a fall-off in milk production
from the dairy sector in recent weeks as a result of the drought.
In England, Milk Marque has already adopted a policy of diverting
supplies into the liquid market.
Jim Hosea, chief executive of Scottish Pride, said that the company
was in a unique position, in Scottish terms, to correct imbalances. With
satisfactory cheese stocks in hand they had decided on a temporary
shutdown of cheese-making activities at Rothesay with effect from today.
Milk from farms on Rothesay will be shipped, at Scottish Pride's
expense, to its plant at Govan. Cheese production at Rothesay will
resume before the beginning of October.
Sixteen employees will be affected by the shutdown. Mr Hosea said the
company would be discussing ways of re-deploying them so that their
earnings were protected as far as possible.
He emphasised that the shutdown was ''a short-term balancing of
supplies in the face of a dilemma affecting the dairy products industry
nationwide.''

EVEN when it was a British manufacturer, in the four decades during
which right-hand drive cars were built at Slough, Citroen was always one
of the small fry, although many of its RHD products were sold in
British-influenced export markets.
Andre Citroen himself really meant business here, to the extent of
opening an exotic-looking showroom in Piccadilly, with an interior which
owed something to the appearance of Napoleon's tomb.
After the Second World War, Citroen was the only foreign-owned
manufacturer allowed to build its cars in the UK. Bearing in mind what
cult status is still enjoyed here by the 2CV -- even in the unlikely
surroundings of race circuits -- it is worth recalling that this car was
built here too, in its ordinary roll-top guise as well as in pick-up
form, and as the faintly more aerodynamic Bijou.
Times have certainly changed for Citroen. It recently notched up its
one millionth UK sale, and the significant fact is that nearly
two-thirds of those cars were sold in the last ten years. Citroen sells
more cars here than in any other country outside France.
The Xantia is the fastest moving model it has ever put on the UK
market, and more and more variations of it are appearing, such as the
1.8-litre SX automatic I have been driving, which comes at a showroom
price of #14,945.
Overshadowed in performance terms by the 16-valve versions which have
recently appeared, the 1.8-litre automatic soldiers on with the older
eight-valve power unit. Like many manufacturers, Citroen reckons that
acceleration and maximum speed are nowhere near top priority for owners
of automatic transmission cars, and much the same can be said for
economy.
As a result, Xantia automatic owners have to be content with a
1.8-litre which peaks at 103bhp, offers 0-60mph acceleration in about
13.5 seconds, a test-track top speed just over 110mph, and fuel
consumption returns like 47mpg at 56mph, 36 at 75 and 25mpg around town.
In fact, when you ponder on these figures, they are by no means
mediocre for the class. And the 1.8-litre version is pretty flexible,
even when linked with a four-speed automatic transmission. The
transmission makes agreeably smooth changes although, as with most of
these systems in a car with modest engine capacity and power, it has a
tendency to 'hunt' at low throttle openings, especially on hills. This
is something which longer acquaintance with the car ought to cope with.
On the road, I was expecting fairly laboured performance, especially
compared with a manual-transmission 16-valve, but this Xantia was more
full of pep than its basic specification suggests. Now and again,
though, I would snick the selector manually down a gear, to give it a
sharper response on hills.
Like all Xantias, this one looks like a compact car but has better
rear passenger space than many people expect, thanks partly to the low
seating position there, although that does not force an exaggeratedly
knees-bend sitting position. All the seats are comfortable, and there is
a fair-sized boot.
One feature which sets this mid-range Citroen apart from all its
rivals of other makes, of course, is the self-levelling hydropneumatic
suspension. The two immediate advantages of the system, especially with
a long-wheelbase car like this, are an absorbent ride and the natural
inclination of the car to keep on an even keel, even with a well-loaded
boot. It can be raised from its usual setting when asked to cover rough
or rutted roads, and I did try out this feature on a long-abandoned
one-time public road down in Ayrshire.
However, the other thing the suspension system gives the Xantia, in
its fine-tuning as well as in its fundamental layout, is unexpectedly
responsive handling. That is thanks in part to the slight amount of
built-in rear-wheel steer. Even this quite modestly specified and
quiet-running Xantia feels like a mature design when taken out on the
road.

<HEADLINE>Mycofarm hits back over sheep vaccine</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976601250</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE manufacturers of a vaccine aimed at protecting sheep from enzootic
abortion yesterday replied to critics who claimed that their latest
advertising campaign could lull producers into a false sense of
security.
Alvin Cerely, a director of Mycofarm UK, said that the problem was a
serious one with losses estimated at between #30m and #35m a year
nationally. Enzootic abortion (EAE) accounted for half that figure and
toxoplasmosis about one-third.
He accepted the comments of the Highland and Islands Sheep Health
Association that the use of EAE accredited female sheep, purchased as
part of a clean health routine, was one way to attack the problem.
''However, since EAE is a sheep-to-sheep disease the spread of
infection is always a risk, no matter how clean the original stock may
be,'' he said.
Vaccination against EAE and Toxoplasmosis offered many farmers the
opportunity to reduce abortion and related losses by a significant
amount.
Mr Cerely advocated a policy of purchasing EAE accredited females and
using the vaccines as a preventive measure. ''Abortion is a huge problem
on UK farms and must be attacked with greater urgency,'' he argued.
''Our survey results show that on average farmers do not begin to take
action against abortion until lamb losses reach 5%, by which time gross
margins will be set for a 10% reduction.''

ONE of Scotland's largest companies yesterday expressed its fears over
devolution.
At brewing giant Scottish &amp; Newcastle's annual meeting in Edinburgh's
Sheraton Grand Hotel, chairman Sir Alick Rankin told shareholders: ''We
believe it could have dangers for totally national and international
companies based in and operating out of Scotland.
''We believe it could have a backlash outside this country
(Scotland).''
Speaking after the meeting, Sir Alick was relatively non-specific
about the company's particular concerns about devolution, which would be
a likely consequence of a Tory defeat at the next general election.
He was, however, worried about the possible impact of the Scottish
Constitutional Convention's proposals for a Scottish parliament with the
power to levy income tax at 3p in the pound above or below the UK rate.
Sir Alick said: ''There could be a 3% variation in taxation. That is
not going to help people to work in Scotland as executives, or at any
other level of the company, if they think taxation is going to be
higher.''
He revealed that the Edinburgh-based company was also concerned about
the effect of devolution on sales of its products, as well as on
shareholders and employees.
Chief executive Brian Stewart is worried about the reaction to
devolution of trade customers and consumers -- presumably those outside
Scotland.
Less than one-fifth of Scottish &amp; Newcastle's profits are generated in
Scotland, which accounts for a similar fraction of its brewing capacity.
The annual meeting, which came only two weeks after completion of the
company's #425m acquisition of Courage from Australia's Fosters Brewing
Group, was attended by a record 387 shareholders.
Sir Alick told them: ''We are more than delighted by the strong growth
prospects which this (Courage) deal will undoubtedly generate.''
Scottish &amp; Newcastle's brewing division was renamed Scottish Courage
on the acquisition's completion, but the parent company name remains
unchanged.
New headquarters for Scottish Courage, which is currently being run
from the group head office in Holyrood Road, are being built near
Scottish &amp; Newcastle's Fountain Brewery, also in Edinburgh.
These should be ready by the spring and will house between 280 and 300
employees.
Sir Alick told shareholders that beer sales had responded positively
to the excellent summer. However, the extreme temperatures have held
back growth of food sales at Scottish &amp; Newcastle's retail and leisure
outlets.
Returning to the devolution issue, Sir Alick said after the meeting:
''We know that our markets have been developed off the basis of the
Union, and not every Englishman thinks it is clever for Britain if
Scotland splits off.
''It is very hard to see how there is a plus to it (devolution) but it
is easy to see how there are possible minuses.''
However, shareholder Leon Sidney Woolf, from London, was unhappy about
Scottish &amp; Newcastle's #50,000 contribution to the Conservative Party in
the financial year to end-April.
Begging to differ with Sir Alick's political views, Mr Woolf said:
''When you have got a weed in the garden you don't put fertiliser and
water on it every day.''
Lord Nickson, who ironically fought off the Elders/Courage bid for
Scottish &amp; Newcastle in 1988-89 as chairman of the brewing group,
retired from the board at the meeting.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle shares yesterday lost 3p to 594p.

CAIRN Energy has undergone such a radical transformation recently that
the company's first-half results fail to give a true picture of its
recent growth and future potential, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Over the last three months, Cairn's oil and gas production has trebled
to 8800 barrels of oil per day equivalent from 2700 as a result of new
acquisitions in the North Sea.
Revenue is therefore running at an annualised rate of over #30m,
although turnover for the six months to June 30 amounted to just #5.1m.
Furthermore, the Edinburgh-based company is about to drill a gas
exploration well in Bangladesh, which could lead to a 10-fold increase
in its energy reserves.
During the year year to date, Edinburgh-based Cairn has sold its US
interests at a tidy profit and pulled out of Spain at a small loss.
Meanwhile, with the help of a #16.9m rights issue, it has bought
Holland Sea Search Holdings for #17.3m and Clyde Petroleum (North Sea)
for #35.8m.
These two acquisitions have boosted Cairn's North Sea oil and gas
output, creating a cash flow that is being used to finance ambitious
exploration programmes in Asia. Cairn is particularly active in
Bangladesh, where it hopes to build a power station to burn some of the
natural gas it is confident of finding.
Cairn yesterday unveiled first-half pre-tax profits of #8m, up from
#616,000 previously. But the increase mainly reflected an exceptional
gain of #5.8m on the disposal of Cairn's Spanish and US interests.
There was no interim dividend and Mr Gammell warned shareholders not
to expect one at the year end either. ''We are basically still a capital
growth stock,'' he said.

HOUSEHOLD products group Reckitt &amp; Colman is busy integrating its
#980m acquisition of L&amp;F, the US household products group, acquired last
year from Eastman Kodak.
Costs associated with this, and reorganisation of the European
business, adversely impacted on interim profitability. In the first six
months of the year underlying sales were flat, but operating profits
from continuing businesses were 3.7% ahead.
At the pre-tax level, profits were just #600,000 better at #149.6m
before exceptional and non-operating items. During the period, the
company's Colman's mustards and Robinsons drink unit was sold to
Unilever for #250m.
Margins dropped slightly from 16.2% to 15.9%, but chief executive
Vernon Sankey said the fall was ''insignificant'' and he is confident
there is scope to further increase margins in the future as the
reorganisation benefits feed through. The interim dividend was raised by
7.1% to 7.35p per share.
In North America, L&amp;F's sales grew by 9%, helped by new product
launches. Integration of the L&amp;F acquisition is said to be proceeding
well, but Reckitt's sales suffered from destocking in the first half
following a change in its remuneration methods for brokers.
This will mean lower discounts to trade buyers in the future, with the
extra funds to be used for customer promotions.
Elsewhere in the group, good progress was made in the UK, France and
Germany in key product areas, and margins benefited from reorganisation
in manufacturing and warehousing.
There was a strong recovery in margins in Latin America, helped by an
improved performance from the Brazilian operations. The African
businesses were impacted by adverse currency movements, but sales growth
was strong in Asia, with Reckitt expanding into new territories.
The balance sheet showed the effects of the increased debt taken on
with the L&amp;F acquisition.
Mid-year gearing was 60%, with borrowings of #569m, but that is a
marked decline from peak borrowings earlier in the year of #820m.
Improved organic cashflow and proceeds from further disposals are
expected to reduce the gearing. However, interest cover is a healthy 6.7
times.
The benefits of the L&amp;F acquisition, restructuring in Europe and
increased marketing of key brands, is expected to lead to a much
improved performance in 1996 and beyond. The disposal of the food
business is part of an ongoing programme of non-core business sales,
aimed at releasing #400m over three years.
Household and toiletry products now account for 80% of Reckitt &amp;
Colman's sales -- up from 75% this time last year. This figure is
expected to grow in future as other smaller disposals are made and sales
are increased in the fast growing markets of the Far East.
North America accounts for a third of the business, with Europe
responsible for just over a third of sales. Emerging markets account for
one quarter of sales.
The interim profits were at the bottom end of expectations and so the
shares dropped 23p to 666p. The consensus forecast was for a pre-tax
profit figure of #158.3m.

BIDS closed yesterday for offers to take over The Scotsman and the

On the market are the Aberdeen Journals group, The Scotsman and its
Edinburgh stablemates, the Evening News and Scotland on Sunday.
It is believed that Caledonian Newspapers Limited, publishers of The
Herald and Evening Times, has successfully raised the relevant finance
to back its bid.
A Thomson Corporation spokeswoman said it would be making no comment
on how many bids had been lodged.
Among the interested parties are a Scottish-based consortium led by
lawyer Ross Harper, Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail,
and a private London-based consortium.
The papers were put on the market by The Thomson Corporation seven
weeks ago after it had sold its English-based titles to Trinity

ONE leading Scottish company which has never made a hostile takeover
is Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the packaging and printing group, which
turned in another set of excellent results yesterday.
The company's chairman and founder, Lord Macfarlane, prefers his
acquisitions to be willing sellers. Since he started the business in
1949, 87 firms have been acquired. As a result his empire is spread all
over Britain, from Aberdeen to the south coast of England.
Yesterday's results package was just what the stock market ordered. In
a day when most shares (outside the electricity sector) moved lower
Macfarlane added 4p to 212p.
Pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1995 jumped by 42.4% to
#10.1m on the back of turnover 52.1% higher at #79.9m. Earnings per
share rose 36.9% to 5.6p and the interim dividend has been increased by
23.9% to 1.4p.
First-half profits are within a whisker of the total for the whole of
1992. Around that time Macfarlane devised a strategic plan to double the
size of the business in five years.
With over #20m clearly in the group's sights for the full year, the
target should be accomplished two years ahead of schedule.
Sales were boosted by the sharp increases in raw materials prices and
by acquisitions. But trading was up in almost every area of the group's
activities. Raw materials prices appear to be stabilising now and
volumes are being maintained.
Lord Macfarlane proudly told me that the company had #12m of cash at
its disposal and no borrowings. Further acquisitions are planned and
there is a substantial capital investment programme in place throughout
the group.
The group runs a tight ship, but it is that unusual corporate animal
combining rapid growth with financial prudence. Part of the Macfarlane
philosophy is to follow a progressive dividend policy so that
shareholders, of whom there are nearly 2000, including most
institutional groups, share in the group's increased earnings.
Lord Macfarlane himself has a 4% stake in his company which is
capitalised at around #250m. He says the institutions appreciate his
financial commitment to the company, a point those who dump their share
options on the same day they acquire them should take to heart.

(An exception is made here to The Herald's rule not to publish
unsigned letters -- Ed.)
HAVING just read John Macleod's article (August 29) I am compelled to
put pen to paper, albeit anonymously for reasons which will be obvious.
I am one of those to whom belongs (according to John Macleod)
''lasting fame and glory'', the Kingdom of Heaven.
I am a woman of 40 years who has lived a heterosexual life having had
boyfriends (more than most because of the desperate struggle to convince
myself of my normality), having been married for 12 years and having
borne a child . . . but throughout my life, I have fallen in love with
women, well aware that the feelings I had for women were those that I
''should'' have had for men.
But -- I've never done anything about it (I suppose John Macleod will
find that laudable!) not because of lofty ideals or notions of
inheriting Heavenly Kingdoms, but because of cowardice and guilt --
all-consuming guilt which has made me feel all my life that the ''real
me'' must be a loathsome creature, to be kept hidden at all times.
Spontaneity is out of the question -- I must first consider what a
''normal'' reaction would be . . . Can John Macleod have any idea of the
anguish that I feel because I perpetuate this profound lie about myself?
Yet in all other areas of life I strive to be truthful, and value truth
beyond anything.
I weep as I write. To add to the guilt I already feel, I feel shame
that I will not sign this letter, and that by maintaining this silence I
am helping to give credence to the views held by John Macleod and his
ilk.
I have nothing but admiration for Michael Barrymore's courage and
honesty -- perhaps one day I might find some too. Meantime, here I
stand, most certainly celibate, but emotionally crippled and incapable
of (or afraid of) the briefest human contact -- in case I give myself
away.
Me (the real one),
Glasgow.

ENGLAND and Derbyshire cricketer Phillip DeFreitas yesterday pulled
out of the last two days of his county's fixture against Essex at
Chelmsford, after his daughter was injured in a scalding accident.
Five-year-old Alex was scalded on Wednesday night at DeFreitas's home
in Bretby, near Burton on Trent.
Derbyshire County Cricket Club secretary Reg Taylor, said: ''Owing to
a serious accident to his daughter, Phillip has asked to be released
from this match and it is unlikely he will play in the remaining two
matches.'' He declined to give any further details of the accident.
A spokeswoman for Birmingham General Hospital, Ms Christine
Ransome-Wallis, said: ''Mr DeFreitas's daughter was brought in last
night as a result of an accident at home. Her injuries are not that
extensive and her burns are less than 40%. She is responding very well
to treatment, although she is still poorly.''
She said the 29-year-old cricketer and his wife Nicky had been by
their daughter's bedside throughout the night.

THE UK housebuilding industry has been in a depressed state for much
of the year, with a number of major players such as Tarmac deciding to
withdraw from the market in the absence of any sustained upturn in
demand, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Persimmon is the latest company to add to the industry's woes with the
publication of disappointing interim results. Pre-tax profit in the six
months to 30 June was #10.2m down from #11.3m previously.
This despite the fact that completions rose to 1676. First half
turnover rose to #115m from #91m but the cost of sales rose to #97m from
#75m. However, the interim dividend is maintained at 3.0p.
The company was gloomy about its prospects in the immediate future --
a fact which had City analysts scurrying to downgrade their full-year
profit forecasts.
Interim profits were expected to be #13m and so analysts are now
expected to reduce their annual forecasts by around #4m to #21m. The
shares sank 17p to 175p.
Persimmon said that steadily worsening conditions had hit margins and
knocked 10% off first half profits. The company is cautious about
whether the traditional September pick-up in business will materialise.
Trading conditions have steadily deteriorated since May.
Building analysts at brokers Smith New Court highlight recent data
which suggests that the industry has entered the second half with a
large number of houses still to be sold.
This raises the spectre of fiercer competition, more incentives and
margin pressure as the fiscal year end approaches. The broker has
recently reduced its forecast for housing volumes -- by 19% in 1995 and
14% in 1996 -- on the back of continuing bad news from the market.

SCOTTISHPOWER is the second major Scottish company to have cleared a
key regulatory hurdle this summer in pursuit of a significant takeover
target.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle has now completed its acquisition of the Courage
brewing interests, while ScottishPower has a few fences to jump before
it lands its prize.
But during the period of uncertainty in the run-up to yesterday's
clearance of all three bids in the electricity sector, Manweb
shareholders have been voting with their feet, either selling their
shares in the market or accepting ScottishPower's terms.
With six weeks still to go the Glasgow-based company already speaks
for nearly 20% of Manweb's share capital. Once Manweb unveils its
package of shareholder sweeteners, ScottishPower can increase its offer
to win over enough shareholders to carry the day.
But the values placed on the shares of Eastern Group by Hanson (975p)
and South Western Electricity by the US electricity company Southern
(965p) in agreed deals suggest that the ScottishPower bid is in the
right ball park.
Manweb shares jumped 93p to 971p yesterday after Board of Trade
President Ian Lang ruled that there was no need for an inquiry by the
Monopolies Commission. This still leaves them below the 981[1/2]p value
of ScottishPower's shares and cash offer.
With so many potential takeover opportunities available in the sector
it is difficult to see why any intending predator would choose to mount
a rival bid for Manweb.
ScottishPower's move to acquire Manweb has enhanced its standing in
the stock market, where its shares, up 1[1/2]p to 340[1/2]p, were 23p
higher than they had been before the bid was announced in late July.
ScottishPower, which is one of the most efficient distributors in the
sector, has chosen its target well. Manweb is a high-cost operator,
which may account for its low standing among both its customers and its
shareholders.
The recent strength of ScottishPower's shares has been enhancing the
value of its shares and cash offer to the point where a higher offer may
not be necessary. If the bid succeeds there should be further mileage in
ScottishPower, which will become the major stock in the sector along
with National Power and PowerGen, the two quoted generators.
The stock market's vote of confidence is unusual at this early stage
in a contested bid and contrasts with the performance of Hanson, which
has now won control of Eastern. Its shares have shed 3[3/4]p to
216[1/2]p since its bid was unveiled.
There was of course no way that any of the planned electricity mergers
would have resulted in the creation of a monopoly situation and hence no
case for a reference to the Commission.
This was recognised by Mr Lang himself and the Office of Fair Trading,
but not by the electricity regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, who
wanted only the ScottishPower bid referred.
The professor has got so much wrong in recent months that there should
be little surprise that the authorities no longer listen to him.
Had his view prevailed this would have resulted in the absurd
situation where ScottishPower's bid for one regional electricity company
in England and Wales would have been blocked while a foreign company's
bid for another would have been cleared.
Like too many cogs in the bureaucratic machine Littlechild seems to
think that the time-consuming process of investigation is productive.
His main concern was that if ScottishPower took over Manweb it would
reduce by one the number of independent operators he could monitor. In
so fragmented a sector as electricity distribution this is hardly a
major concern.
Professor Littlechild has had a bad year. He has shown no sensitivity
in regulating a sector where his pronouncements can have a major
influence on the share prices of the companies which constitute it. He
should be considering whether his position as regulator is tenable after
yesterday's rebuff.
Macfarlane's package

is Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the packaging and printing group, which

Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine
and industrial power group, which prompted a furore earlier this year
with plans to close its East Kilbride plant and transfer the work to
Derby and Bristol, boosted first half profits 75% from #40m to #70m
before tax.
But the improvement is largely illusory as it includes #23m from
disposals -- a decline in research and development expenditure as
anticipated, and a first time three month contribution of #9m from
acquisition Allison, the US manufacturer of military engines.
Chairman Sir Ralph Robbins says that while the half-year results are
encouraging, they indicate that market conditions remain tough.
The rise in sales from #1500m to #1607m was almost all accounted for
by Allison, while sales from continuing operations were flat, with a
small increase in aerospace sales offsetting a decline in industrial
power sales.
Flat sales of spare parts is causing concern to analysts, given that
US rivals GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney have both said recently that sales of
spares are healthier. The interim dividend stays at 2p. The shares fell
15p to 175[1/2]p.
Rolls-Royce's order book has risen from #5900m to #6500m, but this
also reflects the inclusion of Allison. However, a further #1200m of
orders has been announced but is not yet included in the order book.
Sir Ralph does strike an optimistic note, saying that the company is
encouraged by recovering airline profitability and is well placed to
access this long-term growth market through its broad and competitive
product range.
0  In the meantime, the market is likely to take a cautious view on
prospects as the ''tough'' times continue.

I ENJOYED Jack Maclean's pleasant article on the Cowal Games (August
28). I was brought up in Dunoon and so I was fascinated by this
sentence: ''When the Yanks left Gareloch, it looked serious for the
little Bute town.'' Maybe I'm being a bit pedantic, but Dunoon is in
Argyll and the Yanks left the Holy Loch.
I realise, of course, that the weather probably caused Jack Maclean to
spend some time in the beer tents and possibly become a little
disorientated -- Dunoon is of course a long way from Heraghty's.
He also mentioned that Dunoon ''has bristled for years with national
politicians'' and mentions several famous Grammar School FP/MPs.
Another, possibly less interesting FP would be Lord MacKay of (I think)
Ardbrecknish, former MP and recent supremo of the ill-fated Scottish
Conservative Party.
''A strange place, Dunoon'' -- and it's not only politicians! I make a
mere selection from my Dunoon contemporaries and near-contemporaries.
They include: a Dr Who, a senior Glasgow sheriff, a university professor
and vice-principal, a brain surgeon, a national theatre actor, a
television news presenter and interviewer, a QC, a chief
procurator-fiscal, two burglars, a nuclear physicist . . .
The list could go on, but I shall mention only one other Dunoon FP --
The Herald's own wine expert/financial
expert/reviewer/leader-writer/distinguished former academic, etc.
A man of many parts -- and one of those parts is that he was once
prospective Labour candidate for Hillhead in the days of the notorious
absentee Tory MP, T G D Galbraith. Maybe Robert has already put Jack
right.

THE article on rebuilding the Kingston Bridge was most interesting and
revealing (August 28). What if that bridge had crossed not the Clyde,
but the railway into Central Station? Who then would have been liable
for the #100m bill mentioned in your article?
By 1999 the Department of Transport aims to upgrade all main road
bridges to carry 44 tonne lorries and, where these bridges cross a
railway, they propose to charge the costs to BR/Railtrack, a sum of
#400m being thought likely.
When railways were being built it doubtless seemed reasonable that the
promoters should be required to provide adequately for any roads which
they cut. Can it be reasonable, however, that this obligation should
continue in perpetuity?
The lorries for which this upgrading is required are enormously
heavier than those which used the roads 40 years ago, let alone the
horses and carts using them when the railways were built. Such lorries
also compete for the most lucrative traffic.
Why then should Railtrack be required thus to subsidise its
competitors? Why should we, the fare-paying public, have to pay more so
that road hauliers may make bigger profits? What is being asked of these
hauliers as a contribution to an investment made exclusively for their
benefit.
Indeed, in consequence, it is all too likely that, when costs like
these are involved, some railways may well be closed; there would simply
not be enough revenue coming from them to justify such large
expenditure.
Already this attitude to charging for work affecting the crossing of a
road by a railway has deprived the people of Alloa of a restored
passenger rail service. The Department of (Road?) Transport is demanding
such expensive additional measures at every level crossing, all
chargeable to the railway, that the scheme has been shelved.
The Government says it wants to see more traffic going by rail, it
plays lip service to the general view that our roads are too busy and
that more building is not an answer. How then can it allow its
Department of Transport to behave thus?
The privatising of BR is in chaos simply because the Government will
not first attend to the level of the playing field on which road and
rail meet.

Our summer timetable has seven direct trains each weekday from Glasgow

IT is now quite clear that the Conservative Government's rail
privatisation timetable is a complete shambles.
What the next Labour Government must ensure is that the railway
system, as well as being publicly owned and accountable, must be run by
railwaymen who have a knowledge of the industry rather than accountants
and pen-pushers whose primary concern is the balance sheet and not the
running of trains.

There is a need to relicense existing nuclear power stations that are

But contrary to your report the timetable for this process has been

MR LANG has acted with crisp dispatch in freeing all three existing
takeover bids for English Regional Electricity Companies of any
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Irrelevant to the
main issue but of political interest, his move will do his political
stock some good in Scotland where a head of political steam has built up
in favour of ScottishPower's southern venture.
On a wider aspect there are other interesting themes. First, the
decision maintains the liberal stance of British business life by
imposing no barriers (no matter how disguised) to foreign ownership of
British companies, even those in sensitive areas of operation. Secondly,
Mr Lang has decided that the first cast of the RECs is not seen as their
permanent mould. The Government probably erred when it did not break up
British Telecom but it may have gone too far the other way in the
fragmentation of the electricity and water industries; and that mistake
is being reviewed by the markets. (Though that may not mean
ScottishPower is home and dry, since there is still time for a
counter-bid, even if it is hard to identify its possible origins.)  The
judgment overrides the opinion of the electricity industry's regulator,
but it merely confirms the earlier decision in respect of Trafalgar
House's original bid for Northern Electric. It should not be read as a
simple slap in the face for the regulator who has not had a good press
for his efforts in recent months. He has, however, already done well by
users of electricity by his response to Northern Electric's defence of
its independence. His reactions then may make it possible for the new
purchasers to offer no extra or special financial inducements to
customers of the companies involved but in fact Professor Littlechild
had already improved their position. Customers may still hope for more
but none should deny the improvement he won them in the wake of the
first (and so far unrepeated) Northern bid.
There may be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to refer a
future bid or merger proposal in the industry to the examination of the
MMC. Each proposal needs consideration on its merits -- as is the case
in every industry -- and the regulator will still be expected to advance
his recommendations. The fact remains that the Government's function is
itself to make such decisions, though it will sometimes need the MMC to
reject or endorse its view of the national interest, and avoid charges
of partisanship.

THE National Health Service, or at least that part of it which still
qualifies for the description of a service as opposed to a business, has
always been difficult to assess. Anecdotal evidence is not as good as
properly conducted research and perception is no substitute for
objectivity. Nevertheless, the proportion of people in Britain who have
strong feelings on the subject is large and definite in its opinion. The
latest nationally conducted opinion poll for a firm of private medical
insurers shows that the general feeling is of a service in decline. This
will please the insurers who paid for the survey but it should not
please the rest of us. A remarkable 95% of those surveyed felt that more
funds should be allocated while, worryingly for the Labour Party, only
51% felt that a change of Government would make any difference. In
addition, there is a clearly defined impression that the NHS is now a
two-tier affair.
Moving from the general to the particular might give some reasons. The
situation at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, where the management has been
forced to admit that it does not have sufficient beds for seriously ill
cancer and kidney patients, is exactly the stuff of which despairing
opinions are made. In that hospital patients have had to be boarded out
to other wards which in effect means shuffling problems around to the
utter detriment of the patients involved. Worse, the situation appears
to have existed since last May with only now a proper recognition being
given to its gravity. It is unarguable that the NHS needed to be
reformed. Some of the reforms were sensible and creative but many of
them appear to have been ill-conceived and executed without thought or
preparation. If the system was working properly the new hyper-efficient
management teams should have been able to spot problems coming and
remedy them before seriously ill patients had to be treated like pawns
on a board. This has not happened at Ninewells Hospital, nor has it
happened at many other centres. That is why, if anybody need ask,  much
of the reform of the NHS is regarded with such distaste.

A FORMER director of Glasgow-based stockbroker Allied Provincial
Securities -- who helped keep another company in which he was involved
afloat through the issue of #1m of unsecured loans from a private
client's portfolio -- has been fined #15,000 by the Securities and
Futures Authority.
Strathclyde Police's Fraud Squad is now making inquiries into the
matter, but it is understood that no criminal charges have yet been
brought against Michael Duncan, whose employment was terminated by
Allied Provincial as a result of the dealings.
Allied Provincial, which admitted its internal control systems had
been deficient, was itself fined #100,000 and severely reprimanded.
Mr Duncan, who had been with Allied Provincial for about 30 years, was
also expelled by the Securities and Futures Authority -- a move which
effectively ends his stockbroking career.
The loans, made over a period of nearly 2[1/2] years to East
Kilbride-based biotechnical equipment company Fern Developments, were
outside the scope of the client's discretionary agreement.
When Fern ultimately went into receivership in November 1993, the
client lost all of the money. During its last year, Fern, which was in
financial difficulty throughout the 2[1/2]-year period, was only kept
afloat by the client's loans.
A tribunal of the Securities and Futures Authority, which regulates
members of all of the organised City investment markets, commented that
Mr Duncan had ''deliberately kept the client in the dark''.
However, while acknowledging that Allied Provincial had not connived
in the actions of Mr Duncan, the tribunal believed he had been aided and
abetted by the inadequate supervision and systems of Allied Provincial.
Although Mr Duncan conveyed some information to the client, the
tribunal concluded that the client was not made aware of the exact
nature of the payments to Fern or the inherent risk.
Mr Duncan's reports to his client misleadingly recorded the loans as
purchases of Fern's shares.
The Securities and Futures Authority also believed Mr Duncan had kept
his fellow directors at Allied Provincial in the dark and had
deliberately concealed from them that Fern was paying a salary to his
wife.
Allied Provincial, which brought the situation to the attention of the
City watchdog when it was discovered in November 1993, accepted it had
allowed misleading valuation statements and movement reports to go to
the client and had failed to properly protect the client's portfolio.
The stockbroking firm has taken steps to compensate the client. Its
insurance company is currently in talks with the client's solicitor,
regarding a settlement.
Following its recent takeover by Greig Middleton's parent company,
King &amp; Shaxson, Allied Provincial has been merged with and is now
trading as Greig Middleton.
Iain Mackay, an executive director of the enlarged operation, stressed
that no other clients had been affected by the dealings. He added that
steps had been taken to make certain that a senior individual could not
override controls.
A police spokesman said last night: ''I can confirm that Strathclyde
Police are making inquiries into certain allegations made against a
former employee of Allied Provincial Securities Limited.''
Allied Provincial was ordered to pay #35,000 towards the Securities
and Futures Authority's costs. Mr Duncan will have to pay #5000 towards
costs.

I DON'T suppose anyone should be surprised that Ian Lang has waved
through all three bids to take over privatised electricity companies.
There are in Scotland, after all, plenty derelict monuments to his dry
disbelief in interventionism.
This set of bids represented a test of whether the Tories, after the
battering they have taken about fat cats and leaking pipes, are prepared
to lift a finger to ensure that consumer interest is protected. Mr
Lang's refusal to refer any of the bids to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission could not, in that respect, have been more eloquent. They
aren't.
I would not recommend flag-waving on behalf of ScottishPower.
Now that the signal has been given that ownership of the utilities
will be determined through takeover battles, the worm could quite easily
turn in the other direction.
Anyone who has failed to call for the referral of the ScottishPower
bid for Manweb, along with the others, will not have a political leg to
stand on, if and when one of the Scottish companies is threatened with
takeover from outside.
The principle of insisting that each and every bid must be fully
scrutinised by the MMC, as a minimum safeguard for the public interest,
does not allow for opt-outs which say: ''We'll make an exception of this
one, because a Scottish company wants to take over an English one!''
Personally, I do not take an iota of patriotic satisfaction from the
fact that the value of ScottishPower increased by so many millions
yesterday or the prospect of ScottishPower shareholders coining in an
extra pile of bawbees, through the management's cleverness in
identifying the potential for a few hundred more people unemployed on
Merseyside.
As every observer has agreed, there is nothing in any of these
takeovers for the consumer, far less workforce. The predators -- Hanson
and Southern of Atlanta, as much as ScottishPower -- do not feel obliged
to give even a nod in these directions; so confident are they of the
Tories' shared disinterest in them.
Anyway, what is a ''Scottish company?'' More than four-fifths of the
shares in ScottishPower are owned outside Scotland while fewer than 10%
are held by customers and employees. I don't imagine that the ownership
structure of Manweb is all that different.
Yesterday's Mori poll in the Times must have made even grimmer reading
than usual for Mr Lang and his friends. After a summer that has not been
all roses for the Labour Party and has been pock-marked by Mr
Mawhinney's offensives, the Labour lead is virtually untouched.
Apart from the more general diagnosis, that folk are irredeemably sick
of them, one of the main reasons for this must be the constant reminders
-- through story after horror story about the water and electricity
companies -- of just what a confidence trick upon the public the whole
privatisation programme has been.
The last claim on its behalf that the Tories cling to is that it has
delivered massive price cuts to the consumer. However, the more you look
at the evidence -- and perhaps we should have done so more closely
before now -- the thinner that boast becomes.
Figures provided by the House of Commons Library show that the average
household cost of electricity, based on the Retail Price Index, has
increased by 2.1% since privatisation. When I pointed this out recently,
I received a sniffy letter from the Electricity Association -- which
represents the privatised companies -- saying that it was only true if
one included Scotland, Northern Ireland, and VAT. I am happy to make
that clear, on behalf of Scottish consumers who pay VAT!
The other big Tory lie which we don't nail often enough was summed up
in an oft-repeated jibe from John Major in the House of Commons:
''Opposition members still relish the day when it cost the taxpayer #50m
a week to subsidise utilities so that Ministers could run them
inefficiently.''
In fact, telecoms, gas, and electricity all made consistently high
proifts for the Treasury before privatisation -- at a rate not matched
by the tax now taken from their privatised replacements. Mr Major does
not think twice, however, about falsely maligning these great industries
and the people who gave their working lives to make them successful.
If the English and Welsh water authorities had been allowed to charge
at the current rates -- up 50% since privatisation -- they would have
made a profit for the taxpayer too!
The battle to keep Scottish water in public ownership produced one of
the most important victories in recent years. Of course, as George
Robertson was pointing out this week, the structure is intended for
privatisation with the attendant price increases and share options. But
they certainly aren't going to manage that, this side of a General
Election.
When the other utilities, the family silver has been sold and is now
in the process of being resold. The consumer's defence will have to be
through regulation rather than ownership. But, as the takeover bidders
might note, there is plenty potential in that system for redressing the
abuses of privatised greed.

LADBROKE does not expect fully to complete its sale of Texas Homecare
for another year because of a dispute with the buyer, J Sainsbury, over
the final accounts of the DIY retailing business.
It relates to the accounting treatment of stocks, debtors and
creditors, which Ladbroke finance director Brian Wallace said was an
accountants' ''nightmare''.
Ladbroke has received the basic consideration of #290m, so can afford
to wait for the matter to be settled by arbitration. Mr Wallace
commented: ''We would like to increase the price and they would like to
reduce it. There is a lot of money involved.''
He was speaking on publication of Ladbroke's figures for the six
months to June, which show the impact of the National Lottery on the
betting activities.
Even so, a strong performance by Hilton International hotels boosted
group profits by 23% to #56.5m before exceptionals. The interim dividend
is pegged at 2.4p to improve cover.
Hotels raised operating profits by 35% to #65.8m but the division's
boss, Tommaso Zanzotto, is to step down next year.
Ladbroke chief executive Peter George said there had been no
disagreements, and no compensation for loss of office would be paid.
Rather, the role of chief executive of hotels had evolved differently to
Mr Zanzotto's expectations.
Mr Zanzotto himself said his job at Ladbroke, which began some 18
months ago, had essentially been completed. There has been some surprise
by analysts that Ladbroke has not made more acquisitions of hotels,
though it does have plans for more Hiltons.
In the first half, hotels benefited from firmer room rates and higher
occupancy. This rose from 67% to 74% in the UK, with London particularly
strong. Outside the metropolis there was an improvement of eight
percentage points.
Despite being in the final stages of a court case against the
separately owned Hilton chain in the US, the group is still hoping for a
marketing link between the two chains.
Operating profits of Vernons pools were more than halved to #2.7m,
while racing and casinos were down almost a quarter at #37.4m.
Ladbroke says it is not whingeing in the face of competition from the
lottery, but argues that there is not a level playing field because
liberalisation of the betting rules has not come through as expected.
It wants the Government to reduce betting duty and allow amusement
machines with prizes in betting shops.
Racing is being hit particularly by scratch cards and the good
weather, which has reduced the number of horses racing because of the
hard ground.
In addition, Sunday racing has been bad news for betting shops because
punters have flocked to the courses rather than their local betting
shops.
Less understandable was a sharp fall in credit betting. This involves
a relatively small number of big betting punters and they have
apparently found betting opportunities less interesting.
Ladbroke has made 300 redundancies but the problems facing betting are
clearly not susceptible to quick solutions. The group has been cheered
by the approval it has received from the Gaming Board for more casinos,
saying this will stand it in good stead for new licences in America.
There are rumours here that it is interested in buying Rank casinos
from Rank. Ladbroke shares gained 3p to 167p, where they look high
enough for the time being.

SCOTTISH Television has announced a strategic alliance with the
US-owned cable television giant Flextech to secure a niche in the
growing market for cable and satellite television.
Flextech will acquire a 20% stake in STV for #64m with the express
approval of the Glasgow-based broadcaster's main shareholder, the Mirror
Group, which will be pushed into second place when the deal goes
through.
Flextech will pay #28m in cash and transfer to STV its 20% stake in
HTV, the Wales and West of England independent television station, which
is worth a further #36m.
Finally, Flextech and its associates will purchase #2.3m of STV
library material, including the Taggart series, and commission at least
#6m of new programmes from STV over the next three years.
This sophisticated piece of financial engineering, which gives
Flextech two seats on the STV board, must be approved by an
extraordinary meeting of STV shareholders on September 28.
The alliance with Flextech opens a vast window of opportunity for STV
to sell programmes to cable and satellite television broadcasters
associated with its new partner.
It also positions STV nicely to make a possible bid for HTV -- a move
which the Scottish company is believed to have considered in the past.
HTV shares rose 13[1/2]p to 219p yesterday.
''This is a very innovative and imaginative move,'' said Bill McCall,
an analyst with broker Tilney in Edinburgh.
He praised STV for seeing a coming decline in its traditional
television business and taking a bold step to keep ahead of the game.
The alliance with Flextech has already led STV into talks on
programme-making for two Flextech associates -- Hallmark Entertainments,
a US film production company, and Telewest, a cable network which
reaches 547,000 homes in central Scotland.
Flextech has equity stakes in eight UK cable television stations and
manages a further four. It also supplies programmes to several channels
of the BSkyB satellite television group.
The acquisition of a stake in HTV makes STV the fourth-largest
independent television company in the UK after Carlton, Granada and MAI,
and boosts its strength in programme-making and distribution.
The Scottish station already owns 20% of the breakfast television
channel GMTV, and has a 5% stake in the television news organisation
ITN.
''Through the strategic alliance with Flextech we enter promising new
markets in association with some of the biggest international media
groups,'' said STV managing director Gus McDonald.
A move into cable and satellite television is essential to secure
STV's potential for growth in an increasingly competitive market.
The number of households with cable or satellite television is
increasing rapidly, and digital television and the launch of a fifth
terrestrial channel will soon bring more competition on the air waves.
Nevertheless, Mr McDonald said: ''We see ITV audiences holding up
pretty robustly until the end of the century.''
He said the alliance with Flextech would certainly lead to greater
investment in programme production, on which STV spent #40m last year.
But the chief executive said future revenue growth was likely to be
steady rather than spectacular.
STV made pre-tax profits of #7.4m during the first six months of this
year on turnover of #48.9m.
Flextech, which is still investing heavily to build up its UK
operations, made a #7.9m loss on turnover of #15.2m.
Flextech chief executive Roger Luard described the purchase of a 20%
stake in STV as an ''important step'' in his group's expansion into
terrestrial broadcasting and programme-making.
Flextech will buy just over 12 million newly-issued STV shares at 530p
each. This price takes into account the value of the HTV shares and
represents a 14% premium on STV's closing price of 205p on August 29.
STV shares rose 17p to 499p yesterday on news of the alliance with
Flextech, which was up 3p at 438p.
Flextech will become STV's largest shareholder, displacing the Mirror
Group, whose 20% stake will be reduced to 16% with the issue of new
shares.
The Mirror Group was prevented from increasing its stake in STV under
the Government's new media ownership rules, published earlier this year,
and now appears resigned to playing a backseat role on the television
station.
But it still sees STV fitting into its overall media strategy and gets
a seat on the board for the first time. Mirror Group chief executive
David Montgomery will become a non-executive director.
Roger Luard and Adam Singer, the president of Flextech's main US
shareholder Telecommunications International Inc, will also become
non-executive directors of STV, giving up their present seats on the HTV
board.

IT'S little wonder that no-one will buy the West Coast rail line as
long as the Government thinks that railways should make a profit.
Three weeks ago I had to go to Aberdeen to collect a car for my son,
and I chose to go by rail. The fare from Johnstone, one way, was #32.50.
It was an enjoyable trip, with excellent service on board, but after
putting #10 worth of petrol into my car (the tank was empty) I drove
home in much the same time and realised that I could have carried three
others with me!
There is absolutely no way that people will move from road to rail
under the present system. It can only be more cars and roads all the
way.

THOSE in the habit of reading John Macleod could be forgiven for
concluding that he had never heard of the God who loves and is love, or
that he was ignorant of Jesus's greatest command -- to love.
His article, Barrymore goes down the road to destruction, showed
breathtaking ignorance of human sexuality, and many Christians would
find it both offensive and embarrassing, preferring instead to take the
life and teaching of Jesus more seriously.

IF we were hoping that John Macleod (August 29) might actually take
time off from his usual anti-gay ranting to practise a little Christian
charity when it came to Michael Barrymore, we were obviously mistaken.
The reality is that Macleod is not a Christian, but is a man troubled
with Christian feelings and now driven to resolve them by assuming
Christian identity: unfortunately for us gay men (and, I suspect, for
God) he happens to have adopted a particularly narrow-minded, vicious
Christian identity and insists on flaunting it in public.
''Unnatural, dangerous, and evil?'' More a description of your
columnist, I fear, than a description of the many perfectly happy,
stable, and loving gay men and lesbians I encounter in my work.
Michael Barrymore is welcome to join us, if that's where his heart
truly feels at rest.

MUCH as I admire the talent and literary style of John Macleod, I must
take exception to his comments on the homosexual scene (August 29). I
wonder if he writes at times with tongue in cheek to deliberately
stimulate discussion. My gut feeling, however, is that this is not the
case in this article.
Being heterosexual myself, I can only empathise with and hopefully
understand those who are homosexual whether they be lesbian females or
gay males.
John Macleod's assertions that homosexuality is simply a lifestyle and
a concept of modern times are erroneous. It is now accepted that between
5-10% of the population are homosexual, and that both our sex and our
sexual traits are predetermined prior to birth.
In earlier times homosexuals were grossly misunderstood, and were
hounded and persecuted by society in general. It is hardly surprising
therefore that they endeavoured to hide their identity as far as
possible, and this explains why in pre-twentieth century examples they
were hard to find.
John Macleod maintains that the homosexual life is unnatural,
dangerous, and evil, referring obviously to the prevalence of Aids among
the gay community. Recent world Health Organisation figures have shown,
however, that Aids is every bit as prevalent among heterosexuals, and
that promiscuity in either group is the overrriding cause.
The amount of publicity recently extended to homosexuals, both on the
media and by street parades of gay rights protesters, has caused much
righteous indignation and criticism. But it is apparent that they have
been conducted to highlight the rights of the gay community, and to
accord them the dignity, tolerance, and justice they merit.
For John Macleod to sit in judgment is both patronising and
sanctimonious, particularly for one who is a staunch member of the
Christian Church, which preaches, as its base, tolerance and
understanding, irrespective of sex, race, creed, or sexual proclivity.
For homosexuals to have sexual drive and desire for partners of
similar persuasion is surely not sinful or degrading, no matter how
alien it may appear to us heterosexuals. They should no longer be
pilloried or ostracised, but should be allowed to pursue their lifestyle
predetermined before birth, as long as this is carried out in the
dignity of their own homes and without courting publicity.

MURRAY HUGHES is, I think, wrong or over-brief on a couple of points
about the Advanced Passenger Train (August 25).
The abortive attempts to make an APT cover the whole distance between
Glasgow and London were surely not in 1981 but during the Arctic
conditions of January, 1982. They were not the only occasions on which
the APT carried fare-paying passengers. I remember travelling on it from
Euston to Glasgow in 1983 or 1984; very comfortable, but rather
claustrophobic, like travelling inside a high-speed caterpillar.
These latter-day runs do however seem to have been experimental and
unscheduled; I telephoned my wife from Euston to say I was travelling up
on the 4.30pm, only for her to be advised by Central Station, when she
asked them for the arrival time, that no such train existed.

WE hear of a great linguistic debate which took place in a BBC radio
studio somewhere in the Gaidhealtacht. A lady presenter is researching
some detail for one of the subjects which will be raised in a
forthcoming show.
The subject is the New Orgasm, which she had been reading about in one
of those glossy women's magazines. There is a slight problem. She cannot
be sure what is the correct Gaelic word for orgasm.
We do not know what this says about our Gaelic cousins, but no-one in
the radio station is entirely sure what is the Gaelic for orgasm. They
have to take recourse to Maclennan's Gaelic Dictionary where they find
the word is fraoch-feirge. Which translates literally as
''heather-rage''.
Not a single person, despite their deep knowledge of Gaelic, heather,
and life in general, can see where the bonny purple or white plant comes
into it. Nor the rage either.
Luckily there is an alternative Gaelic word for orgasm. It is deine
which translates literally as keenness or eagerness.
Out of this world
WE note that Bonnybridge's status as Scotland's capital of UFO
sightings is under challenge from Fort William.
The Lochaber News reports strange goings-on under the heading ''UFO
aliens to blame in power struggle?'' and tells us that ''alien
interference has not been ruled out following a massive power failure in
Lochaber''.
It was all down to an ''orange-coloured, cigar-shaped UFO'' which was
sighted over the Isle of Lewis at exactly the same time as the lights
were going out in Lochaber. A retired hydro electric board man
speculated that the aliens were tapping the power from the grid to
assist in their take-off.
Housewives in Fort William reported strange experiences: ''Without
warning, doors fell off cupboards and ashtrays and saucers performed
complete unaided revolutions.'' The Lochaber News quotes locals speaking
of ''strange droning noises, whirrings, and hummings''.
How, we ask, is this different from your average night in Fort
William.
Idiot proof
A COPY of a job application form for Clydebank College crosses our
desk. We have to commend the college for keeping things simple on this
form.
Fearing that some of these questions may cause confusion by being a
touch complicated for some applicants, Clydebank has supplied some handy
notes of guidance to explain the bigger words and generally clear things
up.
Question one is entitled ''Sex'' and asks if the applicant is male or
female. The point of this question, it is explained in the notes, is to
''determine the sex of each job applicant''.
Question two is headed ''Marital Status'' and asks applicants to
answer yes or no to the question: ''Are you married?'' This question,
the guidance notes inform us, is ''designed to establish whether or not
job applicants are married''.
Question five is headed ''Ethnic Origin: Are You White?'' The answer
is yes or no. The notes for applicants explains that this question
''establishes the number of job applicants who are white and who are not
white''.
Direct question
THE annual meeting of minds between Scotland's Euro MPs and the
Scottish churches was held recently in Dunblane.
Lothian MEP David Martin was making the point that no-one could
predict the number of countries that would be within the European Union,
but the certainty was that membership of the European Union will
increase. He speculated to the churchmen that there might even be an
application from the Vatican.
This didn't raise an eyebrow from the assembled clergy but it prompted
Ken Collins, MEP for Strathclyde East, to pass Mr Martin a note saying:
''I thought one of the criteria for entry into the European Union was
that the country in question had to have direct elections.''
Disco inferno
AN invitation arrives in a blood-stained envelope, inviting us to the
opening of Terror Under The Arches. This is an entertainment which can
be found in Midland Street, Glasgow, in a complex of dark, disused
railway arches.
Brought to you by the same people who created Alien War, a ''leisure
experience'' which consisted of being chased around dark tunnels by a
very authentic-looking big scary beastie, Terror Under The Arches
promises similar delights, except that this time the tunnels are
occupied by ''real people -- like serial killers''.
Thrill-seeking punters are guided around by a cowled monk, who is
presumably on hand to offer the last rites to victims. It is all pretty
scary. But not entirely unlike how it used to be in the 1960s when the
arches housed a well-known Glasgow disco called The Cave. Except for the
monks.
Above the rim
EAST Lothian District Council is so proud of its public loos that it
has issued excerpts of the comments left in the visitors' books which
they keep in their award-winning conveniences. One D McIngle of Oban
says of the North Berwick facility: ''Spent last night in Edinburgh
Hilton, toilets well-kept but not in this class.''
J Brunton of Edinburgh was moved to say: ''The standard of
civilisation and concern for public health on the part of a local
authority can be judged by the standard of its public toilets, thus East
Lothian District Council rates most highly (if not the highest in
Scotland).''
S McShane of Haddington writes of the loos in his or her home town:
''The toilets are lovely and clean. I will use them now, as I didn't
before.'' And Davina Coyle of Musselburgh says of the Honest Toun's
toilets: ''I recommend to everybody and bring all my friends.'' Makes a
change from going down the pub.

IN theory, the mythological Lilith offers marvellous opportunities for
the female dancer to cut loose in a frenzy of sexuality and unbridled
wickedness. Stories vary, but basically Lilith was Adam's first (highly
prolific) wife cast out by god from paradise becoming subsequently an
uncontrolled she-demon personifying predatory lust, relentless
infanticide, and all manner of midnight cruelty. Strong stuff.
Sadly, across recent Fringes Lilith has prompted some of the vilest
(most self-indulgent) choreography ever to scuff a stage. This version
is no exception. What exquisite torture there is in watching Avis von
Herder's skimpy leotard become an invisible thong between her writhing
buttocks. Rock-bottom banality follows, however, when choreographer
William Louther pitches Lilith as the essence of today's female
executive . . . Some feeble prancing in a suit, coupled with frantic
clutchings of a talismanic clipboard represent the vengeful business
fiend before -- inevitably -- clothes scatter everywhere and Lilith and
her leotard return to the thrustings and squirmings that sorely try its
elasticity and the onlooker's patience.

SILENCE is not necessarily the same as saying nothing. For, as a
lengthy programme note reveals, the Japanese have a tradition of
non-verbal communication. Body language -- even the quality of the
silence -- is regularly used to convey a wealth of meaning. Not so
elsewhere in the world, and it is this tension between the implicit and
the outspoken which concerns choreographer Setsuko Usui.
In Speechless, four women in palest pink and white -- backed by a
sound score that moves between traditional Japanese flute-ings and a
kind of computerised drone -- express this difference in cultures
through dance that is attractive if not exactly riveting or clear cut.
The piece meanders somewhat and is certainly too long for what it has to
say -- the implication here is that less would have been more in the
end.

. . . in your ear, Michael. Punishment. Party conference time is
drawing near, as I'm sure you have not forgotten. Now, just close your
eyes and listen to the baying of those delegates. Red meat is what they
need, lots of it and the redder the better. Pity about our party colours
being blue. Somehow we've always seen the Tories as being a party red in
tooth and claw. It's natural.
Anyway, back to the subject in hand. You've been doing well on the
punishment front. Good, sensitive interviews on crime etc, though it's a
pity the sensitive caring bit got into the tabloids where they don't
tend to understand that sort of thing. Next time you're tempted to
spread it about a bit ask Gerry Warner's advice. Chap knows all about
sensitivity, or so he says. The point is, Michael, you've got to
concentrate on crime and punishment for the next couple of months
because it's just about all we've got. Look at the alternatives. The
police are dizzy with reform and the judges are just as dizzy, but
dangerous when roused. Water and the NHS are best avoided. It has to be
crime and punishment.  So, what are you going to put into Operation
Dostoevsky? Random drug testing in prisons is a good idea. Everybody
says that drug-taking in the prison population is getting out of hand.
Testing for drugs on a random basis is the best way of getting a good
understanding of what is going on. It also makes it easier to put
remedial plans into place when you've got an accurate idea of the
dimensions of the problem. Unfortunately, more is needed. Red meat is
fine for the party, even if it was a touch Middle Eastern to talk about
the punishment fitting the crime. But concerned voters need something a
bit more intelligent.
Involving the reformers is sensible. It's part of the promise to
listen, but remember that people like listeners only if they're prepared
to act on what they've been told. Give the delegates a good show at the
conference. Wave whips, manacles, stocks, anything you like at them. But
moderate it for everyone else. And remember, anyone who gets the balance
of punishment and rehabilitation right for the voters will inherit the
Kingdom of Heaven, politically speaking, that is.

BRIAN Mallon looks and sounds surprisingly like Richard Burton, and
the comparison is apt because he reads from Dylan Thomas with the same
depth and authenticity. But Mallon is capable of more. He recites his
own work, has translated medieval bardic poetry and things in Welsh.
Secrets of the Celtic Heart takes snatches of poetry from Taliesin to
the present and knits it together to tell a kind of non-narrative story.
Swinging from child-like glee to sonorous melancholy, Mallon maps out
the Celtic Heart, taking Wales to be its oldest and most consistent
home.
There are no folk cliches here. The themes are familiar, but the
presentation is original and superbly carried off.

UH-OH . . . it's black bra and pantie-girdle time on the dance floor.
When in doubt -- and there's much to doubt in this piece from Carlson
Dance -- get the kit off. The audience will either look away in
embarrassment or ogle to pass the time. Either way they won't notice the
lack of anything resembling choreography.
The knee-pads and the trainers -- which make the legs of all three
girls look like unvarnished doorposts -- do suggest there might be some
joined-up action, or dance, as we like to call it. No fear. There's too
much red lippy to apply, too many other identities -- ie costumes -- to
climb in and out of, and some utterly ridiculous pratting around with
large pink-fur fabric phallic pouffees to waste time on anything but a
smidgeon of bimbo Eurocrash-ette.
Self-indulgently mediocre, with not even the wit to be bad enough to
achieve a certain kind of cult folly. Put the clothes back on and learn
some steps is my personal advice to this lot.

SKILFULLY editing the play down to two hours and nine characters, this
young company still manages to give it a broad scope in the limited
space. The production is a good lesson in how to gun through Shakespeare
hard and fast without losing meaning or impact.
Paul Curran makes a believable Hamlet as far as shrewdness and
manipulation go, and it is a relief not to have to suffer any emotional
overkill. But scenes with the ghost and Gertrude consequently lack a
focus of feeling.
The rest of the cast members head in the opposite direction, sometimes
losing thought in the expression of furious extremes. But overall they
make impressive use of their spare resources.

WHEN the set -- a kind of mythic Greek tepee-come-shrine -- slewed to
one side and collapsed, Jonathan Burnett did not flinch. He carried on.
For that, anyway, well done.
As for Heroides 12 -- that is not well done, and having seen Burnett
appeal elsewhere in other works, one could wish it hadn't been done at
all. The text of Medea's fraught career comes at us first in a muckle
drench of impenetrable Sco-ats, then in Latin . . . meanwhile Burnett
has fluffed off his narrator's tunic to dawn the scarlet of Medea's
tragic drag. The audience sat, transfixed, like doomed and blinded
rabbits.
They were finished off by Specific Gravity a solo evocation of
relative densities. Sadly Emily Shaw seemed leaden throughout. Nick
Rothswell's live electronic music continued unphased by any of this. I
do hope this isn't the shape of future moves for Vestries-Cassiel.

WITH only a couple of exceptions, Wednesday night's show by Scotland's
premiere jazz vocalist, Carol Kidd, was perfection. Or as near as
dammit. Accompanied by a highly polished trio led by pianist David
Newton (on sparkling, if somewhat passionless form), she was -- as ever
-- most affecting on the ballads. Her I Can't Get Started was utterly
ravishing while every note of This Love of Mine (a new addition to the
Kidd repertoire) was worth hanging on to.
Annie Ross also impressed most with slower numbers like the haunting
Where Do You Start, and the laid-back blues To Hell With Love -- a
number whose cynical lyrics were perfecly suited to her lived-in voice.

WHEN community theatre has ceased to be fashionable suddenly it's all
the rage at the RSC. Last summer, local Stratford townspeople were
coralled into employment in Nigel Williams's promenading Country Dancing
-- some also appear on the stage this season in Peter Hall's Julius
Caesar.
At The Pit in the Barbican, Wedekind's Spring Awakening has a cast
mostly taken by school-age teenagers and in Stratford, during the summer
holidays, Williams's fine adaptation of William Golding's terrifying
allegory on the veneer of ''civilisation'' thinly hiding the true nature
of the typical English (public) schoolboy has been played by a cast of
boys from local Stratford and Midland schools.
For my money it's by far the most successful experiment yet. But
whereas in Spring Awakening, youthful ardour, it seemed to me, didn't
quite make up for the play's technical demands (a minority view,
clearly, since many of my colleagues have dubbed it the hit of the
year), in the Golding, inexperience and a certain anarchic roughness fit
the story's atmosphere like a glove.
Director Elijah Moshinsky too has done a brilliant job harnessing the
energies of his young cast with a combination of spontaneity and
professionalism while there are some remarkable performances from his
leading characters. Marc Elliott's terrifying choir prefect Jack is
every inch an embryonic tyrant in the making, while Daniel Brocklebank's
quietly decent Ralph and Christopher Hudson's grammar school outsider,
the bespectacled Piggy, are effectingly helpless young democrats swamped
before the clever orchestration of Jack's popular dictatorship.

THIS initiative is to be congratulated. Two recent Edinburgh graduates
have organised a show of work by 25 graduates from Glasgow, Dundee,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh in empty premises at 45 Frederick Street; a
central location if ever there was one.
The work is uneven, with too many deeply average, even awful, pictures
but there is also some really good stuff which I recognise from the
degree shows: Jennifer Whyte's black nudes, Georgina O'Neil's witty
animal screenprints, Cock a Hoop and Rawhide, Lindsay Crowe's sensitive
shadowy drawings of people and horses.
I particularly admired Sharon Ramsay's spirery street scenes, like
typographical Giacometti, and Tove Hirth's slender, reductive sculptural
figures.
The organisers have also commissioned window installations from Louise
Taylor and Jane Watt for the 40ft glass frontage. There are plenty of
empty shops in Edinburgh. Others could well copy this bright idea.

YOU are doubtless fed up with Ireland now. So is Ireland. When Mr
Dedalus shouted ''In that case, no God for Ireland!'' he was speaking
not just about God, but about Ireland. James Joyce was once asked by
that dreadful old terrorist, Eamon de Valera, to return to his old
island and he turned it down, for Joyce knew that Ireland eats its
young. And it has done so for centuries. The last quarter century saw
that as well, rather spectacularly.
There is something especially odd about going through, say, Newry, on
the border, and encountering burnt-out shops, their own shops, where
their own people live, and side by side some of the best schools in the
entire British isles, the magnificent gardens blooming, the literary
societies, the neo-para-military clubs.
I have been back to Ireland several times since the Peace Process, the
Ceasefire. I was in Belfast seconds from the decision of the Sinn Fein
to announce an end to the gunfire. And a few months later I found myself
again in Northern Ireland, in Belfast and Derry and Armagh city and just
across the border in Donegal.
I was in Donegal when the hunger strikes were on and let me tell you a
little about the hunger strikes. They were truly tragic . . .
Everybody remembers Bobby Sands; few remember Francis Hughes, Joe
McDonnell, Ray McCreesh, Patsy O'Hara . . . there were 10 who died.
Virtually no British observer understood the deaths at all, for they did
not know of the long, sad history of Ireland, when to shame a neighbour
an Irishman would starve to death upon his neighbour's doorstep.
A strange race the Irish, the Celts themselves. Had the Brits known of
this odd and self-wounding history they would have understood the hunger
strikes more and obviated the terrible tragedies of it -- and perhaps
the terrible years of conflict.
But what has characterised the years of this war has been the
unmistakable colonialism which the British would not dare to enact
anywhere else in the world. Mind, the United Kingdom has had its work
cut out: it has had a peculiar group of rather absurd Royalists jouking
about with banners and every sort of imperialist nonsense which the
British populace deserted 30 years ago.
Mainland Britain finds the Northern Irish Loyalists rather ludicrous
and an embarrassment. It finds their fervour especially in their
religion, positively surreal. It finds the Protestant settler community
not only out of synch' but rather vulgar in its simple bigotry. Yet it,
understandably, finds a slight slice of sympathy with the Orange masses,
for the Irish Free State was driven to a peasant state, led by a
clerical hierarchy with the collusion of a humourless Irish-American
with but scant regard for the wild streak of Celtic romance.
Yet the argument from the Republic has never been one to live with. W
B Yeats said it many years ago, when a senator in the Irish Republic. He
argued that those in the north must remain entitled to the rights they
enjoyed under British rule and if they were subjected to the newly
established, Roman Catholic-based laws there would be ''a wedge driven
into the heart of this nation''.
The faults lay many against the de Valerian oligarchy. We do not like
the laager mentality which we perceive in the Protestant community of
Northern Ireland: there is much to be shocked at in the Irish Republic's
theocracy, which continues in an aged, stuttering, and rather
Alzheimer-ish way. But this is not our island. The British have got to
put bags of gold into this island because it is simple decency to do so
to an island we have abused for so long. But keep out of the argument.
This is an argument between brothers, and, like brothers, they are
entitled to turn on those who try to intervene.
British journalists and politicians and other observers should know a
little bit more about the culture of this land across from us. When the
children of both communities start to think about their Irishness more,
and not in a tribal way, when the little girls of both sides take up
Irish Dancing, and the boys play Gaelic football and hurling, and the
flute bands play with the bodhran, when the Irish family kisses and
makes up, you will find a United Ireland, the way it should be.
And don't give me the old oil about either side delivering their
weapons. Ireland is an agricultural country rooted in dissent and
despair. There are guns everywhere, just as there is in deepest
Aberdeenshire. A farmer without a gun: an Irishman without a past.

SMALL pleasures: is it a function of the ageing process that more and
more of them are negative ones? While I was in Portugal last week (which
was a big pleasure) Janet Street-Porter gave the James MacTaggart
Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh Television Festival, and when I read
the excited reports of her speech I felt simply contented. What bliss, I
thought, not to have to be there.
Every year, in fact, I feel grateful that life and work no longer
require me to attend the Edinburgh Television Festival. This annual
conventicle of the witches and warlocks of the magic box was once
described by one of its more pragmatic delegates as ''six days of
oblivion drinking and power bonking'', but in the late seventies and
early eighties, when I was writing about the tele-fest for first the
Scotsman and then The Herald, I didn't get any of that; just a serious
dose of tedium as the broadcasters pumped iron into their egos and their
obsessions, and an occasional adrenaline-rush to the typewriter as they
came up with a big idea.
The big idea was sometimes provided by the James MacTaggart Memorial
Lecture. I remember Ted Turner of CNN came in person to share his dream
(and our nightmare) of a round-the-clock international news service,
bringing the global village into our cable-stitched sitting rooms in
bite-sized reportage. But not this year; I've read every available
digest of Janet Street-Porter's speech, and its big idea as selected by
the press is spectacularly unoriginal.
Male, middle-aged, and middle-class -- this is her profile of the
executive sheikhs who are dragging the muse of British television into a
desert of low ratings and impoverished creativity. It was ever thus. Ms
Street-Porter, who is not so very much younger than I despite her
nostalgia for Johnny Rotten and the Pet Shop Boys, must surely remember
the days when Kenith Trodd and Dennis Potter regularly charged the
medium with the same Masonic tendency. And Trodd and Potter weren't even
women.
Still, it's the silly season -- or it was before the Bosnian Serbs
fired a shell too many -- and the Street-Porter peroration heavily
engaged the weekend press, who encouraged the suits to fight back. There
were lots of scoffs about the credentials which gave authority to
Janet's experience of the grassroots viewer ('My sister works in
Sainsbury's'') and many waspish remarks about her designer house and
membership of the Groucho Club. The Sunday Telegraph even devoted a
half-page editorial to taking her apart, along with the James MacTaggart
Memorial Lecture, declaring its intention to ignore ''the tangential
question -- who was, or is, James MacTaggart?''
At this point my disreputable enjoyment of its diverting ribbing was
interrupted by a flinch. Loyalty to my old trade of television
criticism, and by association to the medium itself, and by local
association to one of its most gifted practitioners, was affronted. So
was my affection for the English language. A memorial lecture is by
definition dedicated to the memory of someone who is dead. The
editorial's ''who was, or is, James MacTaggart'', which it amusingly
repeated, was either a joke in poor taste or a solecism.
But at least the Sunday Telegraph was accurate with the name of the
Scottish director, producer, and occasional writer whom television
honours most for his stewardship of the Wednesday Play, especially the
1965 season which included Dennis Potter's debut, David Mercer's And Did
Those Feet? and Nell Dunn's Up the Junction.
During those fertile years of original television drama James
MacTaggart pushed back the frontiers of innovation. He died suddenly in
1974, when he was only 48. His widow, Anne Donaldson, was for many years
the Glasgow Herald's London news editor and theatre critic; which makes
it all the more shaming that Saturday's edition of this newspaper thrice
gave his surname a Mc instead of a Mac.
If MacTaggart's preferences in television drama were male,
middle-aged, and middle-class then let's have more of them, even if the
Sunday Telegraph assumes his legacy is confined to the self-regarding
introspection of the Edinburgh Television Festival. ''What could be more
middle-class'', it enquired of Janet Street-Porter, ''than delivering a
pompously named lecture and having it reproduced in both the Guardian
and the Independent?'' Adding, with supercilious malevolence, ''The only
thing plebeian about her, apart from her tastes, are her vowels. We
suspect that Sainsbury's people would not like their children to grow up
speaking like that either.''
Probably not. Sainsbury's, as every shopper knows, is the West End of
the supermarket industry, which makes nonsense of the Sunday Telegraph's
sneer. But if you dish it out, Janet, you've got to take it. I'm less
intrigued by her stale complaint about the hegemony of the three Ms than
I am by some statistics about broadcasting women which, by comparison,
were under-reported. Despite the connection.
At another of the sessions I was glad I didn't have to attend
delegates were told that 70% of women in broadcasting were childless, as
against 34% of men. I'm happy, however, to ponder these figures, along
with those which showed that 53% of women over 40 had no children,
including most of the top executives (Liz Forgan, head of BBC Radio,
Denise O'Donaghue, founder of the independent company Hat Trick, Dawn
Airey, Channel 4's head of entertainment and arts, and -- ahem -- Janet
Street-Porter, voice of the woman in the check-out queue and head of the
new cable channel Live TV) while the big cheeses among male broadcasters
were much more likely to be parents.
In what context was this survey discussed? As I wasn't there I can't
report, but I can easily imagine: career women don't have children or
postpone having children because without the support systems of good
childcare facilities and flexible working hours children slow you down.
The usual catalogue of perfectly proper feminist grievances.
But there's another explanation which dare not speak its name, which
only feminists who have been reconstructed by maternity dare to whisper:
children take the edge of hunger off your ambition.
If there's a choice between spending six days in Portugal with my
daughter or spending six days networking at the Edinburgh Television
Festival, with or without the oblivion drinking and power bonking, there
is no contest.

NATIONAL psyches are strangely elusive things. National caricatures
and stereotypes, sustained by some meagre strands of discernible truth,
are one thing. But getting at a really convincing explanation of what it
means to be French, Japanese, or Scottish is always unfinished business.
If you could sit all Scotland down in one psychiatrist's chair, even a
whole phalanx of Dr Anthony Clares would, I suspect, retire bemused,
baffled, and bedraggled from the verbal fray.
National or ethnic identity is clearly something which matters deeply,
passionately to many people. In former Yugoslavia countless thousands
have died for it. Until a year ago, in Northern Ireland, similar
sacrifices were commonplace.
But what is all this bloodshed and dying for? What, apart from a deep
irrational fear and loathing of the other -- Bosnian Serb for Bosnian
Muslim, Irish Protestant for Irish Catholic and vice versa -- is this
powerful sense of collective identity all about?
Each group, inevitably, tries to emphasise the positive aspects of its
own image. We Scots like to think of ourselves as friendly. Witness the
oft-heard -- but dubious -- claim that there's not much racism north of
the Border. We regard ourselves as generous. Scots are supposed to give
proportionately more to charity.
And well-educated. The merits of our much-vaunted education system and
our huge appetite for newspapers are well-worn markers for that. And
creative. I sometimes wonder if there's anything we Scots didn't invent.
Stir in a pinch of soft-spoken, self-effacing modesty and the picture
begins to gel. Add in some inevitables, like Scotland's fragile location
on the very periphery of Europe. But douse them in our long-standing
taste for international adventure and the final result shines through.
What a braw lot we are, battling against some long, God-given odds,
compared with our loud-mouthed, conceited, introspective southern
neighbours!
We are not good at coming to terms with the more negative aspects of
our collective character. Allegations that Scotland consists of whinging
jocks and subsidy junkies leave us apoplectic and vengeful. Those
southern neighbours know only too well that, to expose the thinness of
our veneer of self-conceit, they need only recycle tales of Scottish
razor gangs, drunkenness, and urban poverty.
Within seconds, Pat Lally's in a lather and we all are reinforced, yet
again, in that pernicious syndrome of Scotland as victim, looking back
nostalgically to better days when the Clyde produced a third of the
world's shipping tonnage, looking forward apprehensively to a future in
which every bottle -- including those containing whisky -- is half
empty.
Let's face it. We Scots have a problem with success. It's not that we
don't, individually, enjoy the taste of it. But we do have a problem
acknowledging success in others. And too many of us seem to enjoy the
taste of having success snatched from our outstretched hands even more.
Too often we seem to prefer the We wuz robbed post-mortem to celebrating
achievement itself.
No section of the Scottish community is entirely immune from the
pernicious effects of this victim mentality. Since the war, Scotland's
indigenous business community surrendered control of sector after sector
to outside takeover. The reasons were a complex mix of stunted ambition,
management failure, poor investment, and lack of vision.
The result, climaxing in the 1980s hostile takeover boom, was a
progressive haemorrhaging of Scotland's indigenous corporate culture as
more and more headquarters closed down and control slipped south or
abroad. We filled the cracks with branch factories, distribution
warehouses, and inward investment. But the damage was done.
The flow of genuinely Scottish companies seeking a stock market
listing virtually dried up. The only real exceptions were new investment
trust vehicles. As we know from Scottish Enterprise research on
Scotland's business birth rate, the flow of new company starts slowed,
too, to rates well adrift of the UK average.
Now there are signs that the tide may be turning. Indigenous Scottish
businesses may be poised for something of a renaissance. Scottish &amp;
Newcastle, having sold its hotel chain at the top of the market, has
successfully diversified into holiday parks and has now taken over
Courage to become the UK's largest brewer of beer.
The creation of Scottish Courage, as we must learn to call it, is all
the sweeter since, not so long ago, S&amp;N was on the receiving end of a
hostile bid from Courage's Australian parent Elders IXL.
Yesterday the President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang cleared
ScottishPower's bid for the English regional electricity supplier
Manweb. The odds must now be firmly on the Glasgow-based group expanding
its interests into that slice of North-west England and North Wales,
nearly doubling its customer base in the process.
The deregulated bus sector is heavily Scottish-flavoured. Two of the
biggest companies are Perth-based Stagecoach and FirstBus, with its
strong Grampian connections.
The stock market listings famine of the 1980s has been replaced by a
modest but steady stream of new issues, from speculative hi-tech
companies like Calluna, The Vision Group and Memory Corporation to
established growth companies like the latest to announce its plans
earlier this week, Morrison Construction Group.
And Scottish Television, which appeared to have missed the boat in the
post-franchise round restructuring in that industry, has now emerged
with a new strategic vision and a new major shareholder in the cable and
satellite specialist, Flextech.
I might add -- but I risk another ice pick in the back for my pains --
that the opportunity now exists for a creative new future for Scotland's
indigenous broadsheet press.
These diverse developments do begin to look like the foundations for a
Scottish business renaissance. But is our collective constitution strong
enough to take a bit of self-generated success for a change. Can we cast
off the sack cloth? Bury the ashes? And recast Cassandra's tolling bell
into something more useful? Watch this space.

SHE came in like a jester and left like an undertaker. The normally
stern mien initially had given way to comparative expansiveness. The
voice, too, was softer. Whereas the duet with Mark Emerson's sparse
violin playing made her singing almost brittle, the addition of Huw
Warren's piano made her more relaxed and let her sing different songs,
albeit along the usual themes.
She sang of love gone wrong, wrong and right. She sang bossa nova and
lampooned overpaid chairmen of public utilities. She made us laugh.
Then, with a finale merging a calm, unerring Will Ye Go to Flanders and
a terse Green Fields Of France, she proved her potency. Not a woman to
pick a fight with, but can she sing!

THIS production of Sandy Wilson's peppy 1920s-set musical comedy is
the perfect antidote to some of the gloom and doom of other Fringe
shows.
As performed by Bristol University's Strawberries With Cream company,
the slightness of plot and characterisation are played up, with a fair
amount of irony, and everything centres on the almost non-stop music and
the visual gags.
Every character is a caricature: from the goody-goody Juliet Mills
lookalike, pretty Polly Browne (an impressive performance from Natalie
Hand) through to the lecherous bourgeois bum, Lord Brockhurst (Martyn
Luke). The star comic turn, however, belongs to Andrea Hayden as the
hyper French maid, Hortense -- 'Allo 'Allo meets Joyce Grenfell.

OVERSEAS House in Princes Street has recently established a good,
regular exhibition programme so I had expected great things. Not so.
Adrian Davidson has given himself the main staircase and filled it with
expensive, badly made, one-liner boxed mirrors.
Thus Apollo is a crude tyre, Venus a seashell, Demeter dried corn.
Eggs, dried marigolds and marbles fill the rest. Snow White with its
witty lipstick, laces and apple is the sole thing of note.
Upstairs the Green Room Gallery shows an assortment of equally
uninspired painting sculpture and crafts by eight artists. Some ceramic
sculpture in plaster and suede is truly, deeply ugly.
Anna Gillespie's stone carved celebration figure and Abigail Reynolds'
Lillies and Irises stand out, worth a look alone among a sea of
mediocrity.

MINTY DONALD sees shades of pop culture icons in the sordid realism of
Scottish Opera-Go-Round's production of Puccini's La Boheme
PUCCINI earns the dubious accolade, in some of the snootier circles of
the opera world, of being dubbed the Andrew Lloyd Webber of the late
nineteenth century. There's certainly some justification for this
comparison: the seeming effortlessness with which he turned out a
succession of damn good tunes, the ease with which his more emotional
arias can be translated into show-stopping tear-jerkers, or his
unabashed enthusiasm for the big chorus number, all bear more than a
passing resemblance to the outpourings of the Lloyd Webber empire, and
no doubt contribute to Puccini's continued prominence in the popular
repertoire.
Scottish Opera-Go-Round's production of La Boheme, which begins a
seven-week tour of Scotland today, steers well clear of the schlock and
stagey showiness associated with the Lloyd Webberesque-end of the
Puccini market. No overblown sentimentality or inappropriately lavish
stage settings here. The practicalities of touring to such far flung and
rudimentarily equipped venues as Ullapool Village Hall and Thurso High
School alone, not to mention the complete absence of chorus and
orchestra, would rule out the possibility of oppulent staging, slick and
hi-tech effects, but more fundamental artistic concerns also push the
production in a grittier, less romantic direction.
Stewart Laing, who both directs and designs the production, making his
debut as an operatic director, is keen to point out the hard-edged side
of Puccini's work. Mimi's death, he argues, is understated and
unsensational, quite unlike the choreographed melodrama of Violetta's
demise in La Traviata. The sordid realism of Puccini's portrayal is, he
claims, frequently dismissed or overlooked. He believes that Boheme
provides an ''accurate representation of how young people behave . . .
of the world of one-night stands''.
This very contemporary emphasis on what Laing describes as the ''cult
of youth and recklessness'' is further reflected in his set designs: a
paint- splattered newspaper-strewn garret, bleak and squalid, empty save
for a rank mattress and the wine bottles stacked in every available
corner. Its references are as much to grunge, the aesthetics of the
squad, as any romantic nineteenth-century attic; the kind of
art-studenty flat that brings back hazy memories of parties you'd rather
forget!
Whether a deliberate attempt to woo a younger audience or not, Laing's
focus on the seedier aspects of Bohemianism paints an accurate picture
of the lifestyles of its original Parisian exponents. His attempts to
capture a sense of youthful abandon, with its attendant careless
cruelty, selfishness, and, in some instances, suicidal despair, reflects
both the behaviour of the first Bohemians, and of more recent examples
of hedonistic and self-destructive youth. Shades of pop culture icons of
the slacker generation: Ian Curtis, Sid Vicious, and Kurt Cobain.
Don't expect all doom and gloom, though. Nor, indeed, the pared down
minimalism of a great deal of touring theatre. Laing firmly believes in
''giving people a bit of a show''. He feels strongly that you cannot
ignore the basic glamour and theatricality of opera and is more than
happy to embrace it. Opera-Go-Round's Boheme will not be lacking in
visual stimulation. (Laing is, after all, still best known for his work
as a designer, and as one who is commendably, if somewhat notoriously,
fastidious in his attention to detail.)
The audience will be treated to proper scene changes: to a production
rich in scenic invention. Not in-your-face spectacle, but a design full
of subtle and witty touches which invite quiet discovery. It even has
its very own, appropriately low-tech, special effect. I don't want to
give the game away . . . go to see for yourself.

VIOLET Verdi is demonstrating how a ballerina should hold her head in
a certain position. ''Mr Ballanchine used to say to use -- 'Lean on a
pink cloud and expect a kiss'.'' You can feel the audience grin with
delight. This is why they have come to watch Violet Verdi take class
with 11 dancers from Scottish Ballet. It is this intimate insight into
Ballanchine and his work -- she was, after all, one of his brightest
stars -- that holds us fast throughout the mechanics of plies,
battements and assemblees.
Dressed in a hyacinth shift with youthful front slit -- plenty of
leeway for illustrating steps -- Verdi still moves with delightful
lightness. Feet, in bright red shoes, dart through bits of difficult
business -- she doesn't just show, she explains why a move should be
just so, tying it in, as she goes, to Ballanchine's style of technique.

THE vitality so disappointingly absent from the Salzburg Camerata's
Haydn playing was abundantly present in that of the aptly-named Emperor
Quartet yesterday morning.
Though Haydn's own Emperor was not one of the works performed, the
later and perhaps even greater G major quartet, Op 77, No 1, formed the
climax of a richly rewarding concert that had opened with the emotional
ambiguities of the B minor quartet, Op 33, No 1, and of Britten's
valedictory Quartet No 3.
Programme planning is an art that these young British players had
clearly mastered in a way that the venerable Sandor Vegh and his
Salzburgers on Wednesday had not. Each work had something to say about
what followed or preceded it; each was played as if it meant something,
not only in itself but in the context of the rest of the programme.
Though not always quite perfect in detail, these were performances
alive in their response to the rhythms, harmonies, and, in Britten's
case, poignancy of the music. On paper, the last notes of Britten's
finale -- a movement subtitled La Serenissima, in tribute both to Venice
and to Death In Venice -- look serene. But in fact, as the performance
proved, they are not untroubled. This was almost the last music Britten
wrote and the playing conveyed not only its hauntingly elegiac tone, but
also the anger and isolation of a dying man.
In such a context, the volatile side of Haydn, rather than his
cheerfulness, seemed to stand out as the music moved through disturbing
modulations and swift-changing moods.
In Op 33, No 1, the interplay of minor and major keys carried the
right feeling of restlessness; in Op 77, No 1, the verve was more hectic
than benign.

RUMOUR has it that some trickster has been hovering outside the Fringe
office handing out blank fliers. All those who have ducked and jostled
through the gauntlet of eager barkers emerge confused. No hectic prose.
No list of one- word praises from parish mags. In short -- no show.
Actually the chap is advertising Week Four . . .
Suddenly it's like January again. The decorations are coming down, the
fridge is going back to low-fat yogurts and mousetrap cheese, everyone
turns into pumpkins by midnight. No, it's worse, it's worse. Because the
fun's winding down just as I'm getting the hang of it again.
Week Three is my ''season of misseds and hollow wistfulness''. Time is
conspiring to leave me wanting. I need at least three afternoons per day
-- or one second Tardis -- to catch up with my hopes. Come tomorrow I'll
be inconsolable. Thirty shows into one day just will not go --
especially when half of them left town a week ago.
It's hard to explain -- even to myself -- where this eleventh-hour
ravening springs from. The programmes that wander across the bedroom
floor tell me I should be sated by now. Relieved, even. No more
suffering for other people's art. No more imagining that brain cells are
audibly dying of boredom -- phut, phut, phut . . . behind the eyes like
popping corn.
I think what I crave, as much as anything else, is the Festival
audience. You never know who's going to turn up next to you. Settling
into my seat for C'est Magnifique, I was disrupted first by one woman,
then by another three, and finally by a straggler who had us all bobbing
and nodding just like . . . just like the female clowns in Embarquez-Les
. . .
I squinted sideways. It was them. No white faces, no red noses
obviously -- but the gestures gave them well away. The sorting out of
who sat where, the taking off of sweaters, the looking around, was like
a little commedia prelude to the mime and mayhem of Deschamps and Co.
I didn't do the Zimmermann Requiem -- but apparently funk diva Chaka
Khan did. Can we look forward to a cover version, released in time for
next year's 50th Fest? I also missed Sir Desmond Tutu. I went to the
first night of The Hard Nut, he popped in later in the run. Did he, I
wonder, leap to his feet with a characteristic ''Yippee!'' as the
curtain fell on some of the hottest snowflakes ever to dance up a storm?
But it isn't simply a matter of schmoozing after celebs. Some of my
Fringe highlights have been the queues before and after shows. Waiting
in a crush of bodies at Hill Street Theatre, I found myself underneath a
conversation between towering Americans. She -- with commendable insight
and great good taste -- was having verbal palpitations over Herald Angel
Yvette Bozsik.
He was quietly passionate about a show I hadn't seen, Like A Virgin.
He had, apparently, cried his heart out. Unbeknown to him, the play was
about a young girl dying. His own sister had been an early casualty of
leukemia. It had, he said, brought it all back to him. She started to
sympathise, he stopped her -- the tears had been good. The show had
surprised him into letting go and there, in the darkness, surrounded by
strangers, he had truly mourned. Such human dramas en route to the very
show . . .
Later that evening I passed a woman, just outside a converted church
that daily enshrines those Aussie hoofers, Tap Dogs. She looked wan,
dislocated. Thinking she too might be suffering from catharsis overload,
I turned back. Yes, indeed, she was feeling shaky. Her stomach was
leaving its moorings, she felt sick. Something she had eaten?
''Something I'd seen.'' The Tokyo Shock Boys had struck again. What a
farce.
But maybe the most uplifting audience I encountered -- and was part of
-- defied the slashing, drenching rain to watch Carmen Funebre in the
open air. Somehow the bleakness of the weather seemed the only true
backdrop for the sense of oppression, brutality and death that stalked
the space.
Watching the symbolic fires that just wouldn't -- couldn't -- catch
light against the downpour was so much more discomforting than any
roaring blaze could ever have been. It was as if all the sodden, grubby
suffering of faceless refugees had fetched up there, in front of us, in
a douce Edinburgh playground.
In the end all around me, faces -- some colleagues, others friends,
mostly yet again strangers -- glinted with mixed tears and raindrops
under the street lights. Hands rattled into pockets for the loose change
that would allow the company to eat a little better, maybe see some
shows in Edinburgh. It suddenly felt lucky, and marvellously free to be
an audience at Carmen Funebre that night.
Already, however, these audiences are melting away. The streets are
emptying. The seething throng of punk Elizabethan and haphazard jugglers
have been displaced by uniformed teenagers in stiff new blazers -- hard
to imagine them as one and the same. A Fringe fair makes a difference in
the young. Any day now and Jenners windows will be buttoned up with
tweedy coats in rusty shades.
I am seized with SAD-ness. Seasonal Affective Disorder, a real
affliction. As the lights go out and church halls return to Scout groups
and sales of work, I squirrel away my brochures and ticket stubs. Stroke
the hat-brim still spotted with rain from Carmen Funebre, stack up the
papers that will join the yellowing files of other Fests at home.
Week Four -- the first week of waiting for the whole clamjamfrey to
come round again. Oh woe! Mind you . . . Tap Dogs are coming to Glasgow
in October!

WORKERS at a Linlithgow electronics factory dined differently
yesterday, when their canteen was turned into a soup kitchen to help
launch a campaign aimed at raising money to help the homeless.
Sun Microsystems decided to help the campaign as part of its community
involvement policy.
Cash raised will go to Jericho House, in Edinburgh, which provides
care and research into problems of homelessness, and where the late Lord
Hugh Douglas-Hamilton first began a campaign to raise #100,000 five
years ago, when he was involved in working at the homeless centre.
Already, #98,000 has been raised for the provision of day care and
primary health care facilities for homeless people in and around
Edinburgh.
Homelessness currently affects 39,000 people in Scotland, with 37% of
those affected suffering from mental problems, according to Jericho
House director Alan Mair.
He described the soup kitchen plan as an innovative approach, as it
would recreate for employees some of the realities of homelessness.

Music
THAT'S it. He's done it again. Game, set, and match to Gunter Wand. In
the final 15 minutes of his first concert, last night, with the NDR
Symphony Orchestra from Hamburg, something extraordinary happened. At
the peak of what had, in any event, been the concert of this year's
Edinburgh Festival, the veteran German conductor, in the finale of
Schubert's Ninth Symphony, let fly with a great sunburst of sound from
his glorious orchestra.
No version of the last movement of Schubert's great symphony has ever
brimmed -- almost to bursting point -- with such light and energy.
Backed by some of the most committed and unanimous orchestral playing
heard at the festival since his own appearance last year, Wand produced
a searing performance that went beyond radiance, beyond optimism. It was
life-affirming; simple as that.
What an astonishing man he is. Tall, gangling, frail, hunched, and
with enormous arms that stretch almost to his knees, the aged,
85-year-old genius had to be assisted on to the stage. As he made his
way to the centre of the platform, he used the players' music stands for
support. Yet the music galvanised him. His body pulsed to the rhythm,
his huge arms produced incisive, firm, utterly confident strokes. His
NDR players followed him unerringly. They might not be the best band in
the world, but under this conductor they sounded it.
Throughout the evening, in totally wondrous performances of Schubert's
Eighth and Ninth Symphonies, some of the most integrated and disciplined
orchestral playing ever witnessed unfolded in the Usher Hall. Schubert's
song-like melodic lines, his bristling, animated rhythms, his
miraculously coloured harmonies: everything received such scrupulous
attention that the most familiar music carried the fresh shock of the
new.
And that shock extended beyond Gunter Wand's magisterial
interpretations into the sound he produced from the NDR Symphony
Orchestra -- a bottomless richness of string sound, capable of climaxes
of scorching intensity, as in the second movement of the Ninth, and of
delicate playing of exquisite beauty, as in the unforgettable version of
the tender cello theme of the Eighth.
As for his sense of rhythm, Wand generates playing of a virility that
would surprise from a conductor 40 years younger. What was heard last
night was so rare it is a genuine marvel. The great conductor and his
orchestra take the closing concert of this year's festival tomorrow
night. It is an event to be savoured.

ROBERT Louis Stevenson's late South Seas story is a swashbuckling
adventure with metaphysical overtones. In Robert David MacDonald's
adaptation it is cut sharply in two halves. Act One is all narrative. A
tale of reckless opportunism in which a degenerate captain commandeers a
ship moored in Tahiti and supposedly laden with a cargo of champagne,
with the intention of steering it off course and disposing of the booty
in Peru. On Kenny Miller's excellent set of slatted wood decorated with
a circle of yellow light bulbs (mirrored by blue bulbs on the ceiling
above) MacDonald presents the story like a forties movie matinee for
children, right down to the closing promise ''tomorrow's instalment
reveals all''.
Patrick Hannaway as the wayward captain turns in an appropriately
blustering piece of character acting, his voice a gruff, heavily
stressed, throaty growl, not unlike the bulldog in Tom and Jerry
cartoons. But, at the same time, there is a subdued, surly presence of
Paul Albertson playing Herric, an Oxford-educated seaman too honourable
to commit wholeheartedly to the buccaneering business. And it's in the
second half, when they inadvertently come ashore on a corrupting Eden of
a Pacific island, that his inward-looking, moody anxieties come to the
fore.
The sailors' adversary is Demant (Brenda Hooper) who rules the island
with an unyielding religious zeal coloured with a high-handed
imperialism that has little more to commend itself than the captain's
selfish greed.
Somewhere in here is the core of Stevenson's moral concern but, on
stage, where dialogue is everything, the motivations are too uncertain
and the arguments too eliptical for us fully to make sense of his
dilemma.

FOR once, don't wait until the last bell rings before scrambling to
your seat. Take time, instead, to drink in the sudden field of flowers
that is the Playhouse stage while Tanztheater Wuppertal is performing
there. Carnations -- Nelken -- hundreds and hundreds of them, so
delicately pink and white that it comes as something of a shock when
elegantly dressed figures start trudging through them carrying
armchairs, settling down as if in some grand hotel.
But here, at the start of Pina Bausch's disconcerting, crazy,
wonderfully uplifting work, there is an insoucient licence. This is
Liberty Hall where anything is allowed: even leaving the stage and
asking the audience to show you the exit . . .
We laughed, delightedly, at a man singing the words of Some day he'll
come along, the gestures like some sophisticated hand-jive to the music.
We giggle, when Jan Minarik solemnly tunes us into his heart beat. And
when the stage fills with fellas in fancy frocks, dancing like
two-year-olds we titter and guffaw. Until Minarik, stern, officious, and
disrupts the fun.
Dog handlers with Alsatians corner the field. A man is collared. He
has to show his passport.
Gradually a new mood creeps into the apparent child's play. A game of
Grandmother's Steps becomes fiercely tyrannical. A group of men hold
hands while reciting tactics for deflecting trouble.
Freedom, innocence, youthfulness, has somehow slipped over the
horizon. A series of ritualistic, repetitive moves -- conjure the
enforced obedience of an authoritarian state. The petty humiliation
mooted out are so ludicrous they heighten the sense of oppression.
Yet, Nelken radiates a marvellous optimism, an encouraging resilience.
People have been pushed to all manners of extremes. There are some fly
moments when the company protest at the rigours of performance, and of
Bausch's directions! There are moments that hit hard, even for those of
us up in the circle. But all this is merely a precursor to a celebration
of hope.
Ultimately Nelken is about the freedom of spirit, the value of choice,
the relevance of art.

MAYBE the heat has gone to their heads. Either that or the sangria,
retsina and a severe overdose of Turkish caffeine has befuddled their
marketing faculties. How else, Muir Anderson wonders, to explain why the
UK's biggest tour operators yesterday launched their holiday brochures
for next summer?
There are, after all, still two months of this season's left to run.
They are still lumbered with this summer's leftovers. They know wily
customers are waiting, still, for low-cost deals this year: ''It's
absolutely crazy,'' says Anderson, the Scottish spokesman for ABTA, the
Association of British Travel Agents.
''You would think, wouldn't you, that they would be concentrating on
clearing out all the holidays still unsold this year? Not to mention the
coming winter's offerings.'' But, no, while travel agent's windows are
festooned with day-glo offerings of last-minute breaks at boot sale
prices, while Spanish hoteliers work out how four people will fit into
400 spare rooms, while in Greece shopkeepers grieve over the disastrous
season and vie to fleece the few visitors in rip-off tourist traps, the
Big Three tour operators yesterday launched their summer programmes for
1996.
Thomson Holidays, the biggest operator, was not due to launch its
brochure until today. But scrabbling to steal a march on their rivals,
First Choice -- third largest -- sent out a fax yesterday morning to say
they would be launching their programme at teatime last night. In a
retaliatory strike, Thomson promptly opened bookings. Not to be outdone,
Airtours, too, are open for next year's business:
''It used to be January, then it was pushed back to November or
December. Last year, it was August and now they've done it again. They
are like squabbling children. Everybody is confused, and in the long
term its not good for customers or the travel trade.''
Now the Big Three travel agents' have joined in the race, offering the
lure of 10 to 12% discounts for those who book early. Along with the
annual launch came the annual stern warnings about booking early,
booking now, to avoid disappointment. After a decade of expansion,
Airtours -- the UK's second biggest operator -- is reducing the number
of holidays it plans to offer next summer by 10%. The third-largest,
First Choice, has cut planned capacity by 15%. And Thomson Holidays, the
biggest operator is following suit with reduced supply and price rises.
There is, naturally, method in the summer madness, according to
Anderson, an independent travel agent: ''It's got nothing at all to do
with what the customers want,'' he insists, fuming quietly amidst
K2-like mountains of brochures. ''It's all about the big operators' race
for market share.''
If it's not for the benefit of tourists, then what is it all about?
Last year, 10 million package holidays were sold in the UK. For this
year the big tour operators, somewhat optimistically, increased the
number of holidays on offer by around 7%. But wobbly consumer
confidence, the late bookings trend to wait for cheap deals and a long,
hot summer conspired to leave the tour operators with a surplus of
package holidays on their books.
By the end of October, when final figures are known, it will be clear
just how badly the tour operators have been stung, if at all: anecdotal
evidence is that wily customers are still grabbing cheapo deals --
offered simply, in tradespeak, to put bums on seats in the sky -- and
that overall the figures for those who choose to package abroad will not
have fallen much below 10 million. The excess might prove to be in the
extra holidays added on because of over-optimistic projections last
year.
Now, while the tour operators trim the number of holidays on offer for
next year, they remain intent on gouging a bigger slice of market share.
It is that, says Anderson, which is behind the crazy dash to win
bookings for next year:
''It's all bound up with the big companies wanting to increase their
market share. They seem in the process to have lost sight of what the
customer wants. Most people don't particularly want to commit themselves
a year in advance. It's difficult enough to get them to book, without
opening 12 months ahead.'' Last year, he says, an initial flurry of
bookings tailed off and simply died.
''Those who want free child places or a particular hotel will be first
in the queue no matter whether it's August or January when the brochures
are launched.''
Anderson has reason, perhaps, to sound jaundiced: the early launch
causes nightmares for travel agents stuck with a stack of holidays still
to sell for this summer, and with the winter season still to come: ''But
it's not just that. I simply don't see huge numbers wanting to book for
next summer now. It's marketing gone mad. The big travel agents, tied in
with the tour operators, are forced to join the race. They need to hang
on to their market share.
''But everybody is confused. Do you take the discount now for an early
booking or wait for next year's late booking discounts? And, to be
honest, the big tour operators charge more for holiday insurance which
offsets the discounted prices.''
Which all sounds like a Dutch auction. But if the hoidaymaker wants to
plough through the brochures, or hang on for a cheap deal, why not?
''Well, short term somebody gets a discount which is good. Long term,
if this goes on, what will happen is the smaller, more specialist
operators will be pushed out. Which will leave the three big travel
operators and their related travel agents as all you have left. In the
long term it's not healthy for holidaymakers or the industry.''
A spokesman for A T Mays, Scotland's largest agents, was unrepentant:
''It makes sense to book early to get what you want and get a discount
for it.''
Despite the gloom, he says, there has been no big reduction in the
numbers of those flying abroad.
The trend to all-inclusive package holidays continues. Travel fashions
may change, but the big attraction for Scots -- Spain -- remains the
same. It has 40% of the Scottish package market. It remains to be seen
whether the 10% hike in prices for next year, as Spanish hoteliers look
for a bigger profit cut, will erode that share.
While Greece remains, this year anyway, the second biggest holiday
magnet for Scots it may see its share reduce dramatically next year. The
Greek tourism industry acknowledges having a disastrous summer with
revenues down at least 25%. This has been caused by spiralling prices
and an acknowledgment that it cannot match the bargain-basement deals on
offer from its least favourite neighbour, Turkey.
The director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, Howard
Davies, recently argued the case for persuading holidaymakers not to
vote with their feet, urging them to holiday at home rather than abroad.
And while the hot summer has helped boost the domestic market, the
figures to show by what extent are still awaited. The home tourism
market tends to get the second holiday business.
A decade ago, Thomson took 1,000,000 Britons on holiday abroad. This
summer it took 1,000,000 to the Balearics alone. In global terms, world
tourism is set to grow by at least 4% a year over the next decade,
making it the world's biggest ''industry'' by 2000. According to the
World Tourism Organisation, there were 450 million tourists in 1990.
There will be 650 million by the year 2000 and a billion by 2010.
What modern tourism is all about, according to Tourism Concern, a
British pressure group, is growth, growth, growth and to hell with the
consequences. Few of us, they point out, understand the damage tourism
can do to its host country.
Now, as Scots -- bored by Spain, wearied by Greece, and feart of
Florida's drive-by shootings -- begin searching for new destinations,
the tour operators are expanding their range of places for people to
roam.
According to the A T Mays spokesman, long-haul holidays are
increasingly better value for money. As for fears of exotic destinations
being lured into the honeyed trap of mass-market tourism, concerned that
it may yet do to Africa, the Caribbean, Thailand and Malaysia, what it
has already done to Spain and parts of Greece, the question arises: who
cares? Perhaps only those who can afford to travel on scheduled flights
to small, uncommercialised destinations. The split between the posh and
the package-tour peasants remains. While you are a tourist, I, of
course, am a traveller.

David Steele report on Maybole's pleas for a by-pass to save the High
Street
THE words of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton ring rather hollow in Maybole
as it fights for its survival in the face of a traffic problem which
threatens to choke the life out of the Ayrshire town.
The Scottish Office roads minister responded to criticism of failing
to carry through by-pass proposals for scores of Scottish towns by
saying that the core network must come first and meanwhile traffic will
be calmed with islands and roundabouts which do not cost a lot.
As local councillor Danny McNeill put it: ''A fat lot of good that is
to Maybole as the shops continue to close, the buildings are blackened
and undermined, and the people just stop coming in to the town.''
The ex-Provost of Kyle and Carrick has a bulging mailbag of complaints
from local people about the growing traffic problems in the area as
tourism in the South-west grows and the peace dividend from Northern
Ireland sees goods and passenger traffic using the port of Stranraer
escalating faster than ever.
''We have been waiting for by-passes to be built around Maybole and
Girvan for close on 40 years and each time we think it is about to
happen we slip further down the queue. Both towns should have been
by-passed by last year if the original plans had been carried through.
The routes have been surveyed and some of the groundwork done in the
past. Then nothing.''
The strange paradox in Maybole is that far from fearing a loss of
business by traffic passing them by, local traders believe they could
enjoy a boom if the town became relatively traffic-free and people could
park and walk around.
A trip up the High Street in Maybole illustrates the situation
graphically. At least three or four stops will have to be made in the
few hundred yards through the centre to allow huge lorries, vans or
caravans to squeeze through.
It is a High Street which would have been just perfect for the traffic
of the turn of last century when many of the buildings were put up and
the town grew. It just does not cope with 1995 traffic and local people
shiver at the thought of what things might be like by the year 2000.
Willie Ross, a butcher in the High Street, said: ''The situation is
unbelievable. People have to stand in against the wall to allow some of
the big lorries past and I have seen two lorries scraping against each
other as they try to pass in the main road.
''I have never been in any doubt that we should have a by-pass. People
just take one look at Maybole and decide there is no place to park and
nowhere to shop so they head for Ayr or Girvan. It is choking the town
and one by one the shops are closing.''
Ross is pragmatic about the possibility of a by-pass but called on
some measure to be taken in the town, such as a one-way system. He
added: ''It works when the Open is at Turnberry so it should be tried
all the time. It may not work though as the lorries running up and down
to the ferry get bigger and more powerful.''
Pat Gray, who owns Frills ladieswear shop in the High Street, said:
''The passing trade which we may lose with a by-pass would be balanced
out if people could walk in peace and safety in Maybole.
''I have customers from all over the area and they are finding it
harder than ever to get parked and move about the town. The extra
traffic using the road is good news for someone but not for us in a town
which can't cope with the cars and lorries it gets at the moment.''
Lord James wrote to local MP George Foulkes last week reminding him
that the focus must be on trunk roads and the apparently all-important
''core network'' but offering the heartening news that a Route Action
Plan is under way for the A77.
The RAP is designed to improve safety, amenity, journey times, and
ease of travel by a series of measures targeted at identified locations
where remedial action is required, wrote the minister.
Foulkes said: ''That is all very well where something can be done but
quite frankly there is little that can be done in Maybole because of the
existing roads around the town.
''It is of little comfort to local people in many towns and villages
along the A77 and A76 in South Ayrshire that the Scottish roads network
is getting better. They have to get around in comfort and safety and
their visitors should expect the same.
''Ever since Malcolm Rifkind was at the Scottish Office trunk roads
have been seen as an excellent vote catcher and money has disappeared
from vital by-pass projects to fund projects like the upgrading of the
A74. I will be speaking to local people and councillors and the pressure
will be stepped up.''
Joe Goldie of the Cassillis Hotel said: ''At night you can walk out of
the door and feel the draught of a huge lorry hurtling past at 60mph. It
is only a matter of time before someone is hurt or killed in the town.
''The by-pass must at least be put on the list of priorities or people
will just pass by Ayrshire altogether on their way to places which are
more accessible and more attractive.
''I do not fear a by-pass taking trade away; in fact I believe it
would greatly improve a situation which gets worse every day.''
Isobel Seymour, who brought up three children of her own and fostered
dozens of others in Maybole, said: ''I still have a petition gathered 10
years ago with over 1000 signatures. We called at every door we could
and got two refusals, one businessman who feared loss of trade and one
elderly man who said he had been waiting for a by-pass since 1918 so
what was the point.
''Mothers in the town are in constant danger as they push prams or
walk young children up the High Street. The time is long overdue for
Maybole to be by-passed and flourish at the same time.''

MARGARET HUGHES seeks expert help to pick the best of this year's crop
of gourmet offerings in print
ONE of the fastest selling books in America last year was Cooking With
Rosie, the Oprah Winfrey-inspired cookery book.
Here in the UK the book did not create just as big a stir, but then it
was jostling for position alongside our own breed of celebrities pushing
cookbooks. Except in the case of the UK it is the chefs who are the
celebrities, and putting together a book of their recipes is becoming as
much a prerequisite for success as a television series!
To test the recipes in a selection of the most popular cookbooks, we
asked three chefs Colin Clydesdale, of Stravaigin, in Glasgow's Gibson
Street, Michael Mizzen, of the Glasgow Hilton, and Angus Boyd, of
Mitchells, North Street, Glasgow, their opinions of their colleagues'
offerings.
Here's their selection and verdicts.
FAR FLUNG FLOYD, Keith Floyd, Penguin #9.99
* FLOYD manages to impress viewers by cooking in unusual locations,
but how easy is it to recreate these dishes? Colin and Michael found the
book lacked authenticity. Colin said: ''I have travelled extensively in
the Far East and have never seen any of these dishes being cooked.''
Angus felt the book was short on recipes.
Marks out of 10: 5.
COMPLETE COOKERY COURSE, Delia Smith, BBC Books, #9.99
* EVERYONE agreed this was excellent value for money and the sort of
encyclopaedic book that will remain popular for years. Marks out of 10:
8
RHODES AROUND BRITAIN, Gary Rhodes, BBC Books, #12.99
* GARY Rhodes is very popular at the moment, but will his recipes
last? Michael believed they will: ''This is good down-to-earth cooking,
with easy to follow recipes, good usage of cheaper cuts of meat and
ingredients.'' Angus agreed: ''This is a good book for both serious and
novice cooks.''
Marks out of 10: 7
EAT YOUR GREENS, Sophie Grigson, Network Books, #10.99
* NOT vegetarian but a myriad of different ways to serve vegetables.
Colin said: ''This book is easy to read, recipes are easy to follow,
some ingredients would be difficult to source in Glasgow, but it is
informative and enjoyable.'' Angus admired Grigson's knowledge: ''Best
cooking methods, when vegetables are in season and details on storage
are all very useful.'' Michael admitted even he had learned something.
Marks out of 10: 7
BLANC MANGE, Raymond Blanc, BBC Books, #18.99
* THIS book covers Blanc's latest television series which looked at
the science of food, as well as ways of preparing it. Michael liked the
scientific aspects of the recipes. Colin was baffled as to who would
really want to know the scientific details of the food they are
preparing: ''I disliked the layout of the book and the photography did
not make the food look appetising.'' Angus felt the book was definitely
for the more serious cook: ''I wonder how beneficial the scientist's
notes are, will people mentally digest them as they prepare the
dishes?''
Marks out of 10: 4[1/2]
FLAVOURS OF INDIA, Madhur Jaffrey, BBC Books, #12.99
* THIS book combines recipes with a history of the regions in which
the dishes originate. Colin raved: ''Just looking at this book makes me
hungry! I have used her books before and have always found the recipes
simple, the ingredients easy to get hold of and the results authentic.''
Michael agreed: ''This is more than a cook book. The recipes are very
straightforward and there is a good choice of vegetarian dishes.'' Angus
liked the inclusion of details of mail order suppliers of specialist
ingredients.
Marks out of 10: 8
HAMLYN NEW ALL COLOUR COOKBOOK, Hamlyn, #7.99
* THIS brought a few groans as most of the recipes were tried and
tested dishes. Angus felt it was too basic: ''Even the most
inexperienced of cooks want to try something more adventurous than this
book provides.'' Colin was impressed by the number of recipes, but
little else: ''These are very traditional recipes which will probably
work, but you will not produce haute cuisine.'' Michael added: ''This is
a book for beginners, recipes are easy to follow, but a little old
fashioned.''
Marks out of 10: 4
FLAVOUR OF SCOTLAND, Brian Hannan, Mainstream Publishing, #14.99
* RECIPES from the kitchens of 12 Scottish chefs are compiled in one
book which aims to illustrate the richness of Scottish produce and
inventiveness of its chefs. Michael liked the concept: ''It is good to
have ideas which marry the use of Scottish ingredients with
international ingredients and styles of cooking. The recipes are clear
and easy to follow.'' Colin thought it was a good idea that different
chefs were included: ''There is a good cross-section of styles and
recipes . . . However, it is not for the beginner.'' Angus agreed that
some recipes were a little difficult: ''I did not feel there was a
strong flavour of Scottish cooking. I liked the layout, the recipes were
clear and technical jargon was kept to a minimum.''
Marks out of 10: 6[1/2]
* All books supplied by John Smith &amp; Son, Glasgow.

Piers Morgan's appointment as editor of the Daily Mirror has ruffled
feathers in Fleet Street, observes William Russell
FLEET Street is in terrible tizzy because the editorship of the Daily
Mirror has been bestowed upon Piers Morgan, the 30-year-old editor of
the News of the World. Wherever hacks forgather for a pint the sediment
is being read. Those who drink tea are looking at the leaves for
guidance. What does it all mean?
In the real world, where Fleet Street editors are shadowy figures at
the best of times these days, it may seem small beer. After all, it is
merely a move from a Sunday to a daily tabloid. The problem, however, is
that the two tabloids have different owners. The News of the World
belongs to News International and detaching Mr Morgan from its
employment is a major coup for the rival Mirror Group.
Although editors come and go overnight at the whim of their proprietor
they do not do so at the whim of a rival. News International made clear
yesterday that they intend to hold their man to his contract, said to
have up to another 18 months to run, although in reality a deal will
probably be struck, the contract bought out. A reluctant editor in situ
is unthinkable.
Although it would technically be possible to dump the man in limbo
until it had run out, that is unlikely. Meanwhile the present editor,
Colin Myler, who is to become managing director of both the Daily and
Sunday Mirrors, will soldier on.
The Mirror Group has already provided a home for another ex-Murdoch
man, the legendary Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of the Sun for 13 years. It
was MacKenzie who made the Sun what it was, if not what it is. He now
heads the Mirror Group's television interests, having fled the coop
after an uncomfortable spell in Mr Murdoch's media empire as managing
director of BSkyB television. Mr Morgan was a MacKenzie protege -- he
edited the Sun's Bizarre pop column for some years -- so it looks like
the chicken is coming home to the rooster.
Piers Pughe-Morgan -- he dropped the Pughe when he joined the Sun --
became editor of the News of the World, Britain's largest selling title
in January last year when he was 28 or 29, depending on whom you
believe, and is the youngest Fleet Street editor since Hugh Cudlipp got
the chair of the Sunday Pictorial in 1937, aged 24.
He has proved a great success at the News of the World -- not that he
has put on circulation, the name of the game today being to retain
rather than increase it -- although there were some hiccups as he took
the paper down market and into the mire. Sales for July were 4,684,245,
slightly up on the June figure last year, but the sales for the period
from February to July are down by just under 1%.
The loudest hiccup was in May when he was publicly rebuked by Mr
Murdoch for running a story about the Countess Spencer's treatment at a
private clinic for eating disorders and alcohol addiction. The rebuke
was a bolt from the blue, especially as he had been attracting press
awards galore, like this year's Scoops of the Year award from What the
Papers Say. It was enlarged from Scoop of the Year in recognition of his
efforts in securing a raft of sensational stories like the Princess of
Wales's telephone calls to Oliver Hoare.
But even the Dirty Digger has his limits and Mr Morgan had overstepped
them. The Press Commission rapped him over the knuckles, but editor's
grin and bear such blows. The really painful one was delivered by Mr
Murdoch, whose desire for respectability has led to a rare recorded
instance of a leopard changing its spots. He said, while he would always
support worthwhile investigative journalism as a community
responsibility, it was clear that in this case ''the young man went over
the top''. He would not tolerate News International's newspapers
bringing popular journalism into disrepute, he added.
Since the Sun has been responsible for much of the disrepute, quite
apart from some of the seamier News of the World stories, it is a wonder
he was heard above the sound of glass-houses shattering, but he is a
born-again Christian repenting.
The Morgan list of victims is impressive -- the Bishop of Durham, Alan
Clarke, Hartley Booth, Melvyn Bragg, and Richard Spring were all exposed
for the gratification of his readership and he pandered to their tastes
with tales like Bienvenida Buck's affair with the chief of defence
staff, Sir Peter Harding, who duly resigned, and David Mellor's affair
with Lady Penelope Cobham, as well as the three-in-a-bed romp involving
Richard Spring, Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Patrick Mayhew,
the Northern Ireland Secretary, another man and a woman called Odette
Nightingale. The nightingale duly sang.
The problem with that story was Mr Spring, who is divorced, appeared
to have been set up, which is not quite the same as boldly going where
no man has dared, the traditional path of a News of the World reporter.
Troilism is not illegal. But the story gives readers of the Mirror some
idea of what they should look out for when he takes over because he will
undoubtedly bring the morality which has shaped his ends so far to it
too.
His father, Glynne, was in the meat distribution business in East
Sussex and he comes from a comfortable middle-class background in
Haywards Heath. On leaving school, unable to go to Warwick University
because he did not have the right grades and needed to resit some
subjects, he took a year off to work in the City as a clerk at Lloyds.
He then did the journalism course at Harlow Tech, serving his
indentures on the Wimbledon News, where he proved immensely hard-working
and a source of stories, before moving to the Sun in 1988.
He became the pop column writer and a favourite of MacKenzie's who was
said to be grooming him for stardom. An editor's baton was said to be in
his briefcase along with the Filofax and it was on MacKenzie's
recommendation that he got the News of the World job, an appointment
which left the hard men of the made-an-excuse-and-left school trembling
with rage, but not for long.
So what can the Mirror staff expect? Since he sacked some top
executives at the News of the World almost immediately he took over
there will be some shaking in editorial shoes. As for the Mirror
readers, he will almost certainly inject into the paper the virtues and
vices he brought to the News of the World.
His inexperience is no longer an issue. He is, after all, 30, has run
a major national newspaper for almost two years, and while his
achievements as a by-lined writer about the world of pop were mainly
manufactured -- the sub-editors are the unsung heroes of the tabloids --
his reputation as a reporter is unchallenged. He brought in the stories.
The difficulty these days is in telling the Sun and the Mirror apart.
They look alike and contain the same mix of stories, even if their
political stance is different, and tales about TV personalities, large
and small. The Sun has lost the MacKenzie touch and the Mirror has lost
its way. Mr Morgan's accession means we will have to continue taking the
tabloids for some time yet.

* TIME was when the whining schoolboy crept unwillingly to school like
a snail, sorrowfully aware he was unable to contact mum or dad if he was
bullied or beaten. BT aim to change all that -- with a barrage of ideas
for phoning home when there's a problem.
In a free guide, they haven't overlooked the possibility that junior
might have blown his or her last 10p on a bag of crisps -- so parents
are urged to acquaint offspring with the reverse charge call. (BT might
usefully have added that this operator-connected service costs #1.80 a
time, plus phone charges.)
Cheaper options include #2 phone cards or a special Phone Home BT
chargecard that can be programmed to ring just one number and is
supplied free. Details of how to obtain the card, and other advice on
keeping in touch, are in Growing Up With BT, from post offices and BT
shops, or by calling 088 800 842.
* TAPPING out a phone number could be difficult, of course, when a
child's glasses have been broken or scratched in a playground
roustabout. With this in mind, High Street opticians Dollond and
Aitchison launch a back-to-school range of Kidsafe lenses made from
extra-strong plastic, hard coated to make them all but unbreakable.
The polycarbonate lenses give extra eye protection and, say D and A,
are lighter and more comfortable. In a range of styles and colours --
some inspired by Disney characters -- they come with a one-year repair
or replacement guarantee. NHS children's vouchers can be used for
Kidsafe.

nappy changing facilities, child menus, and high chairs are among family

stop-overs allow motorway drivers to relax while kids release pent-up
energy. For details of outlets situated within minutes of motorway
junctions and a free map, call 088 600 900.
* ANIMAL compassion charity Viva! is calling on young Scots to back an
autumn rally in Glasgow to protest against crating live animals for
export. Superstar Richard Gere, Damon Albarn of Blur, and Grange Hill's
Ian Rushmere are backing the campaign, which includes a ''Crate Escape''
competition, with prizes from cruelty-free cosmetic and clothing
companies. Posters and a leaflet explaining how to get involved from
Viva! PO Box 212, Crewe CW1 4SD.
* ONCE it was pencil-sharp pleats -- now recycled jean pencils are a
pointed way for teenagers to make a fashion statement. Berol's Eagle
Jeans pencil is encased in genuine denim clothing offcuts reclaimed at
the factory.
After sweeping America, the pencil is now making its mark here through
Morrisons stores and Toys R Us branches in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, with
a recommendation to wear it jauntily behind the ear. A pack of six costs
#1.99. To banish back-to-school blues and encourage writing skills,
Berol offer garish pencil cases and ghoulish skeleton pens to accompany
wacky Yikes stationery.

Somerfield stores until September 15. Part of a campaign to encourage
families to eat more fruit and vegetables, shoppers are invited to spot

ROYAL Welch Fusiliers who endured six months of sniping and shellfire
in the besieged Bosnian enclave of Gorazde yesterday won praise from
their commander as they arrived back in Britain.
''Despite the danger and deprivation, I seldom, if ever, heard a
complaint. That is because we all believed what we were doing was saving
lives,'' said Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Riley.
Tired but elated to be home, the last British contingent of Gorazde
protectors flew into RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, still wearing their
battledress and blue UN berets.
Colonel Riley, 40, revealed details of their hazardous withdrawal from
the Bosnia ''safe haven'' hours before the massive Nato air strikes,
Eighty Fusiliers left from the original Gorazde force of nearly 200
pulled out in darkness to prevent any repeat of the hostage-taking
incident in May when 33 Fusiliers were kidnapped from their isolated
observation posts.
''It was a pretty rapid move out, through a minefield at high speed,
before either side could catch their breath and know what was going on.
We made it to the Serbian frontier in one go and I can't tell you what
it felt like to cross that frontier,'' said Colonel Riley.
The battalion's ''cat and mouse'' tactics included the use of
Welsh-speaking signallers and radio operators to foil any Serb
eavesdroppers listening in to communications.

THE Pentagon is sending more electronic warfare planes to add punch to
Nato's air assault.
Twenty-five air force and navy planes were singled out yesterday for
possible deployment and an unknown number were heading out, a senior
Pentagon official said. It was not clear whether all 25 would be sent.
Among the aircraft on standby were four EC-130 planes equipped with
communications jammers, and two airborne battlefield command centers.
Also alerted were F-4G Wild Weasel radar hunters, EA-6B Prowler
electronic jammer aircraft, and one AC-130 Spectre gunship.
The Air Force also prepared to send from European bases more KC-10
tanker aircraft and OA-10 planes that serve as forward air controllers.

By Our Foreign Staff
UNITED States envoy Richard Holbrooke said yesterday that efforts to
end the fighting in Bosnia had advanced dramatically and reiterated that
a 51%--49% split of the country would be a starting point for
negotiations.
Holbrooke, US Assistant Secretary of State, met Croatian leaders and
Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey in Zagreb to brief them on his
talks on Wednesday with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Milosevic announced on Wednesday the Bosnian Serbs had agreed to give
him a veto over terms of a peace deal that would now be bargained out by
a six-man team, three of whom would be from the breakaway Serb
''republic'' inside Bosnia.
Holbrooke described Milosevic's announcement as a breakthrough but
stressed that tough talks lay ahead. ''We agreed that President
Milosevic's announcement that he has formed a single negotiating
delegation with the Bosnian Serbs was a procedural breakthrough,''
Holbrooke told reporters after three hours of talks with Sacirbey.
''We are here to try to bring peace to the region and this has been a
dramatic advance,'' he added.
He said Milosevic had endorsed the American initiative and had already
agreed to a peace plan drawn up by the Big Power Contact Group. The plan
allocates 51% of Bosnia to the Bosnian government and Croat federation
and 49% to the Bosnian Serbs.
''The 51%--49% division is a starting point for negotiations and
mutual adjustments are possible,'' he said.
Sacirbey said Nato air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions had improved
the climate for peace talks but cautioned that Serb heavy artillery
remained a threat to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo.
''We sense a new attitude (from the Serbs), although that attitude has
not shown itself on the ground,'' Sacirbey said.
Holbrooke was due to return to Belgrade yesterday and travel to
Germany tomorrow to brief the Contact Group as well as European Union
peace envoy Carl Bildt. He said he would then speak to Nato chiefs and
ambassadors in Brussels.
''We want to make sure that all people are on the same wavelength
because we are moving forward very rapidly,'' he said.
Holbrooke earlier quoted Croatian President Franjo Tudjman as saying
serious talking to end the fighting in former Yugoslavia could begin now
that Milosevic had effectively wrested control of negotiations for
Bosnian Serbs.
Diplomats in Belgrade celebrated Milosevic's announcement as a sign
the Bosnian Serbs had bowed to his will. But Serb political sources were
sceptical.
Word filtered out in Belgrade of a second, secret part of the deal
between Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs that suggested their deal was
more compromise than triumph.
The Bosnian Serb leadership was reported to have won guarantees from
Milosevic that he would protect their interests and achieve certain
minimums in a peace deal, which the Bosnian government and Croats would
quickly reject.
Milosevic was said to have agreed to seek the division of Sarajevo,
the widening of a northern Serb-held corridor in Bosnia, and compact
territory -- which would spell the end of a Moslem presence in the
Gorazde enclave.
Whatever concessions were won from Milosevic by the Bosnian Serbs, the
agreement still appears to vindicate his view that Serbs will win more
in talks than on the battlefield.
Meanwhile, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic indicated yesterday
that Bosnian government forces may take advantage of Nato air strikes to
retake territory occupied by Bosnian Serbs.
Asked in a German television interview if the Bosnian army would use
the opportunity to recapture lost areas, Silajdzic replied: ''It is the
task of the Bosnian army to liberate its territory.
''But if you think we are exploiting the situation then I think we
know better,'' he added. ''We may fight for our country but we have been
living there for a thousand years, after all.''
Earlier, Silajdzic held talks in Bonn with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel. At a news conference after the meeting, he said the
extensive air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo had
made peace more possible.
''The air raids are raids for peace,'' he said. ''I believe that the
regime in Belgrade will finally understand that the monopoly of force is
gone.''
The Bosnian Prime Minister said he thought Belgrade might now exert
enough pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to bring them to the negotiating
table.
Silajdzic, who later addressed a Bonn conference on genocide in former
Yugoslavia, said he and Kinkel had agreed that plans for the economic
reconstruction of the region should be part of any peace settlement.
''The document should also contain an annex committing the
international community, and those countries that can do something about
that, to actually implement a Marshall Plan in Bosnia when the peace
comes,'' he said.
''For the last three-and-half years, we have been deprived of
civilised life. We have turned into Stone Age people.''

near Oviedo in the coal-mining region of Asturias.
It is believed that a build-up of firedamp gas caused the explosion,
which was Spain's worst mining accident in 20 years. Unions called a
national strike today in all Spanish mines in tribute to the dead.

A Republican-led crackdown on crime in America is having a marked
effect on prison populations, as Ros Davidson discovers
AMERICA has been known for violent crime and tough lawmen ever since
the days of the Wild West. But that image has taken on a new potency
with a report that America currently has 5,000,000 convicted criminals
-- enough to populate Scotland -- either behind bars, on probation or
paroled.
The report counts a record 1,500,000 criminals in federal and state
jails, and another 3,500,000 convicted but not behind bars. Criminals at
any one time may soon out-number the country's 6,000,000 full-time
students if the trend continues.
According to the Department of Justice study, the most comprehensive
ever, the number of people incarcerated has tripled since 1980 -- and
within a decade will exceed the population of New York, estimated at
7,300,000. On average an additional 230 people are imprisoned every day,
and more than 1540 new prison beds are filled weekly.
The annual increase, the second largest in history, is the result of
various policy and legislative changes that might be called a
law-and-order ''crack-down'' as the national policy drifts to the right.
Not surprisingly, America's prisons are at least 25% over capacity,
says the report. Even before the new figures, the US jailed a higher
proportion of people than anywhere else except for post-Communist
Russia.
This latest federal report comes as the issue of crime returns to the
national debate. The Republicans' Contract with America calls for
millions of dollars for states to build more prisons. Republicans have
also recently introduced laws that would cut programmes for crime
prevention mandated by President Clinton's crime Bill of last year. The
US already spends an estimated $21bn yearly operating prisons and $5000m
on constructing new ones.
In a similar ''law and order'' push, some states are also withdrawing
more and more privileges from inmates. More prisons are banning TV and
cigarettes. Alabama has even reintroduced ''chain gangs.''
The first 160 inmates on ''rock duty'' -- shackled together at the
ankles --smashed rocks into gravel with 10lb sledge-hammers for 10-hour
shifts in heat that had reached 30C degrees at 9am. Part of a campaign
to reduce crime by making prisons highly unpleasant, the idea has been
adopted in Florida and Arizona, and is being considered in Kansas.
In that vein, the federal report is hailed as encouraging by
conservative politicians, who say it shows harsher measures work, at
least by lengthening prison sentences. Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist
at Carnegie Mellon University, concedes that some criminals are now off
the streets and unable to commit murders. But he cautions: ''We should
think very hard about the trade-off'' -- between tripling the number of
prisoners and a relatively small decrease in crime.
Violent and serious crimes did drop 3% in 1994, according to the FBI.
But there is hardly a clear trend of less crime -- the use of guns by
criminals is also becoming more common. Almost 30% of the 4,400,000
worst crimes reported in 1993 -- murders, rapes, robberies and
aggravated assaults --involved a gun.
Clearly, the increase in imprisonment is in part because of the ''War
on Drugs'' started in the 1980s under President Reagan -- although drug
treatment programmes have been cut back -- and also various new tough
''law and order'' measures. The most infamous is California's ''Three
Strikes'' law, requiring a sentence of 25-years to life for a felon with
a record of two previous serious or violent crimes.
The law is so harsh, one Sonoma County judge refused to impose the
sentencing. Petty criminal Jeffrey Missamore, the father of an infant,
faced 25-years to life in prison for taking eight grammes of marijuana
into jail while serving time for petty theft. He had been convicted
before for receiving stolen property.
Overcrowding in prisons will also lead to more health problems and
violence amongst inmates, says Jenni Gainsborough of the American Civil
Liberties Union. Cells are already being used for more inmates than they
were designed for. ''Hot bunking'', where inmates sleep shifts in a
shared bed, is also being considered in Washington and two other states.

RUSSIA is unlikely to allow its anger and humiliation at Nato military
action in Bosnia hamper crucial relations with the West, diplomats and
political analysts said yesterday.
''There will be fresh anti-Western rethoric, calls to oppose Nato
expansion, demands to reconsider the treaty on conventional forces in
Europe,'' said military analyst Irina Kovrinskaya.
''But, in fact, there is little chance things would go beyond that,''
added Kovrinskaya, who works for the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace think-tank.
Top Russian diplomats have complained that Moscow was not consulted on
the Nato attack.
Nationalist groupings in the State Duma or lower house stepped up
their pressure on the authorities yesterday, calling for a special
session to discuss the situation which ''emerged after Nato unleashed
war on the Balkans''.
Russia's demands to halt the operation were not supported in the
United Nations, where most countries backed the strike aimed at
destroying the Serb military potential and infrastructure, said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin.
''In fact, as a result of the operation, not only Nato but the United
Nations as well appeared as allies of only one side in the conflict.''
Meanwhile, ordinary Russians spoke out against the air strikes, saying
the alliance should have found another way of silencing guns which have
killed thousands of civilians.
''You will never solve anything from a position of violence,'' a woman
in her thirties said as she rushed into the underground at Moscow's
central Kiev station.
Asked to suggest another way of stopping attacks like the Serb shell
which killed 37 civilians in a Sarajevo market on Monday most Russians
still said they opposed bombing the Serbs.
''There is always another way,'' was the opinion of ordinary Russians
questioned on a busy Moscow street. Although confused about the details
of the crisis in former Yugoslavia they were certain air raids were not
the answer. -- Reuter

THE Chief Minister of the Indian state of Punjab and 12 other people
were killed in a massive car bomb blast outside the state government
offices in Chandigarh today.
Beant Singh, a Sikh from the ruling Congress party who had been Chief
Minister for three years, was blown apart.
There was no immediate indication of who was behind the blast, in
which at least 30 people were injured.
Singh was always surrounded by commando bodyguards, five of whom died
in the blast along with two aides. He was known for his tough methods in
putting down a revolt by fellow Sikhs campaigning for an independent
Khalistan.

US experts say they have scientific proof that bones found in a
shallow mass grave near Ekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains belonged to
Russia's last Czar, Nicholas II.
The findings may finally put to rest a 74-year-old mystery about the
fate of Russia's last royal ruler, murdered in July 1918 with his family
at the start of the Communist era by Bolshevik soldiers in the town near
the Asian border.
''We have finally resolved one of the longest-running murder
mysteries,'' said Dr Pavel Ivanov. He was announcing the results of DNA
testing by the US Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.
Ivanov was appointed by the Russian Government to oversee the
investigation to determine if the bones found in the grave in 1979 were
those of Nicholas II.
Two years ago, the Home Office's Aldermaston Laboratory confirmed
through DNA tests, using blood samples from the Duke of Edinburgh and
other relatives, the identities of the Czarina Alexandra and three of
her five children, and the results have not been seriously challenged.
Although most historians believe the bodies of her two other children
were burned beyond recognition, a legend has grown up around Anastasia,
the youngest child, and Alexis, heir to the throne, with pretenders
surfacing periodically.
However a slightly irregular result in the Czar's DNA sequence, an
extremely rare condition known as heteroplasmy, was found in the British
tests, raising some doubts that it was him. The probability of
heteroplasmy occurring was believed to be one in 300 per generation.
In its three-month investigation, the team of US forensic experts
found that the key to proving whether the remains in the grave were
those of Czar Nicholas II was his brother, the Grand Duke George.
His remains were exhumed from the Romanov mausoleum in St Petersburg
and brought to America. They shared a rare genetic anomaly which removed
all doubts about the Czar's identity.
A Russian government commission will now consider how to bury the last
royal rulers of the country and the Russian Patriarchal Church may
proceed with canonising them as martyrs. They were canonised in 1981 by
the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad.--Reuter.

THE world's women told each other today that they can do anything they
set their minds to -- and proceeded to knock down Chinese-imposed
barriers to free speech and challenge global authorities.
Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent six years under house
arrest for fighting for democracy in Burma, set the tone in her
videotaped address to the NGO Forum on Women, the largest ever meeting
of women.
She urged governments to spend ''less on the war toys of grown men and
much more on the urgent needs of humanity as a whole''. Some 3000 people
heard her speak and applauded her for a full minute.
Amnesty International delegates paraded with banners and pictures of
11 women political prisoners, including two in China. They circulated a
petition calling for the women's release and said they would deliver
copies to the governments involved.
Tibetan women who live in the West showed a videotape of Tibetans
forced into exile. Women delegates who came to see the tape grabbed it
back from two Chinese who tried to seize it.
Throughout it all, Chinese security videotaped and took notes
furiously, but only in the case of the Tibetan tape did they attempt to
interfere.
The first working day of the NGO Forum, a gathering of private
activist women held in tandem with the UN's Fourth World Conference on
Women that starts Monday, was everything China had feared.
China insisted that the 10-day NGO Forum be held in Huairou, a small
town an hour's drive from Beijing, in order to limit contact between the
women and ordinary Chinese, who were barred from the site.
However the foreign forum delegations said they would not be
suppressed.
''We have not been silenced anywhere in the world, and we will not be
silenced in China,'' said Pierre Sane, secretary general of Amnesty.
Organisers said about 17,000 participants had arrived in Huairou by
yesterday morning, and that 10,000 others who had hotel reservations
were expected to arrive today.
They had no count of how many were denied visas by China because of
their political or social views.
Suu Kyi, on the other hand, did not seek to attend the forum because
she feared Burma's military rulers would bar her from returning
home.--AP.

KASHMIRI guerrillas holding two Britons and two other Western hostages
are running out of patience, Indian officials said today as their talks
with the kidnappers entered a crucial stage.
Last night the Al-Faran guerrillas hardened their position after
handing over evidence that the four captured tourists were alive and
well after more than eight weeks in captivity.
An Indian official said: ''They have hardened their attitude. They
were very angry. They told us they had provided proof that the hostages
were alive and well, and wanted to know what else we wanted from them.
Otherwise, they said, unless something is given in exchange it was all a
waste of time.''
Officials later said the militants and government negotiators had made
contact tonight.
''There is no deadline. There was nothing alarming during today's
contact. We can only hope that there will be a contact tomorrow,'' said
an Indian official. ''The talks have entered a crucial stage.''
This morning Indian negotiators contacted an intermediary who has been
involved in the talks. ''They asked the intermediary to tell Al-Faran
not to harm the captives and that Indian authorities were seeing what
they could do,'' the official said.
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, American Donald Hutchings, and
German Dirk Hasert were kidnapped in Kashmir early last month.
Al-Faran transmitted messages from the Britons and the German
yesterday, indicating they were all alive and well. The messages came
two days after the American spoke by radio to negotiators.
The hostages' relatives released a statement welcoming Al-Faran's
''humanitarian gesture'' and saying they looked forward to the speedy
release of the men.
Yesterday the militants demanded a gesture from the Indian Government
after agreeing to give firm evidence that the hostages were unharmed.
An official said before today's contact: ''Al-Faran will be waiting
only for a satisfactory answer. If it doesn't come, they're not prepared
to continue with negotiations.''
Al-Faran wants India to free 15 jailed militants in exchange for the
hostages. New Delhi has ruled out a swop but said some Kashmiri
prisoners could be released as part of a regular review of
sentences.--Reuter.

A CAR bomb ripped through a crowded working-class district of Algiers
today, killing 10 people and wounding at least 15.
It was the latest in a growing number of car bombs that have been
blamed by the army-backed authorities on Islamic fundamentalists, who
oppose presidential elections due to be held on November 16.
The bomb went off at 11.50am in Mohamed Ounouri Square in the
capital's Bab El-Oued district, a densely populated area near the city
centre and a Muslim fundamentalist stronghold.
The square houses the headquarters of the Algerian security services,
DGSN. Security round the building has been stepped up in recent months
and cars are not allowed to park anywhere nearby.
Algerian Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mensour rushed to the scene,
the Algerian news agency APS reported. It said 10 people were killed and
15 were wounded.
Bab El-Oued was the focus of a bitter struggle between security forces
and militants of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) during 1992. In
January that year, the authorities cancelled a General Election which
the now-banned FIS was poised to win.
More than 40,000 people are estimated to have been killed in violence
since the poll was scrapped, and November's planned presidential
election is viewed by the authorities as a way of bringing the country
out of crisis. Their Islamic opponents oppose the poll.
''One would be out of his mind not to expect more killings in the
months ahead,'' said an Algiers-based diplomat earlier this month after
the authorities, headed by President Liamine Zeroual, announced the
election date.
The militants have increasingly turned to car bombs to press their
cause and yesterday, an Algerian newspaper reported that the interior
and energy ministries had imposed strict controls on the use of gas
canisters in an apparent attempt to halt their use in bomb attacks.
Today's attack was at least the fifth car bomb attack this month. The
bloodiest was in January when a suicide bomber killed at least 42 people
and wounded nearly 300.
Gas canisters were used in two bombs which killed seven people and
injured a total of more than 100 people in France in the past two months
and investigators there suspect Algerian militants may be behind them.
The militants accuse Paris, the former colonial power, of supporting the
Algerian government in the North African country's conflict.

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S biggest wind generator is producing power for the national
grid again -- more than two years after the Government recommended its
demolition.
A group of private investors have sunk their savings and time into
repairing the 150ft power plant at Burgar Hill, in Orkney, and claimed
yesterday the three megawatt generator could produce up to 10% of the
island's electricity.
Mr Tony Burton, site manager when the machine first produced power in
1988 and now one of the investment team, said the Department of Trade
and Industry had been wrong to write off the project.
That was in December 1992, when a crack appeared in one of the two
blades -- which weigh 65 tonnes and have a combined diameter of 200ft.
Mr Burton said the project had cost #17m by that stage but the DTI had
advised that the generator should be demolished.
''It's a massive source of non-polluting energy and it was crazy to
shut it down for the want of the #30,000 it's cost us to repair it,'' he
added.
Among those involved in the consortium are the sustainable energy
centre at De Monfort University, Leicester, and Aberdeen-based wind
energy company Sustainable Resources.
Mr Richard Gauld, managing director of Sustainable Resources, said:
''In 1992, before the crack developed, it produced almost 10% of
Orkney's electricity, that's the level of power generation we are now
trying to achieve again.
''We are confident we can, and that will earn us around #50,000 a
year, which will more than cover our costs and give us a return on our
investment.''

<HEADLINE>Road ahead for Edinburgh traffic. Regional council plans radical pedestrianisation to ease congestion in Princes Street.</HEADLINE>

LOTHIAN Regional Council, due be killed off next April, yesterday
decided to take most of the traffic in Princes Street with it.
It is now seeking orders for the biggest change to Edinburgh's most
celebrated thoroughfare, banning eastbound vehicles, except buses and
bikes, and funnelling the rest up to Queen Street and through York
Place.
Traffic heading west is unaffected. The council's transportation
committee was told by its convener, Mr David Begg, that Edinburgh should
be looking even further west to Glasgow's example of complete
pedestrianisation of sections of Argyll and Sauchiehall Streets, which
had boosted profits for the shops.
''If Princes Street had been in any other country in Europe, it would
have been pedestrianised long ago. That is largely due to the
conservatism, with a small c, within this city,'' he said.
''I don't think these proposals are radical enough but we are taking
this course because it is a step forward in the right direction.''
Congestion has always been a problem in Princes Street, built 200
years ago not as a shoppers' Mecca but for people to live in and breathe
fresh air away from the stench of the Old Town.
It took Dr George Hazel, director of transportation, to point out what
that means in 1995. On a typical Saturday, it attracts 70,000 people and
10,000 vehicles, mostly cars. The latter manage to knock down at least
one of the former every week. Some of them do not get up again.
Work on the scheme, which will cost #1.2m, will start in the New Year
and should be complete by next August in time for the festival.
How it will affect parking is another matter. Every month, police tow
away 650 cars parked illegally in Edinburgh, but officials believe the
2000 places provided in new car parks since 1993 more than compensate
for the loss of 160 on-street places in the proposals.
The plans were published originally last October and modified after
consultation. New Town residents' groups were not happy and were left to
draw up their own plans in conjunction with officials.
As a result, there will be a series of road closures in Heriot Row,
Dublin, Northumberland, and Glenfinlas Streets, and traffic calming
measures elsewhere.
Cyclists have secured a lane for themselves along Princes Street and
taxi drivers can also drive eastwards, at least from Frederick Street,
and bring fares up from Waverley station.
Mr Begg stressed that the Edinburgh scheme was an experiment and would
be modified in the light of difficulties.
There could be some ahead on Queen Street, planned by James Craig on
similar lines as Princes Street. Its original buildings, long-spared the
onslaught of diesel and petrol exhausts, are much better preserved and
it is the longest sequence of eighteenth century architecture in
Edinburgh.
The Tory opposition, although insisting it was not against measures to
cut down on traffic in the city centre, unsuccessfully asked for a delay
to gather more information about the proposals, particularly as they
affect the West End.
Ironically, they might cause a few headaches to the council's
executioner, the Scottish Secretary, since some of the diverted traffic
will be rumbling past Charlotte Square, within earshot of his official
residence at Bute House.
* Plans for a car-free residential development between Gorgie and
Slateford Roads in Edinburgh were also approved yesterday. It is
modelled on a scheme in Bremen, where residents forsake cars as a
condition of their tenancy but can hire them cheaply from a nearby
garage when needed.
Dr Hazel said nobody thought the idea would take off in Germany but
the builder was inundated with applications. ''This is a very important
experiment to let people see there is an alternative to the way we are
going,'' he said.

QUITE frankly, the Royal Mail does give a damn what messages people
put on their franking machines, as the trade union Unison discovered
this week.
Unison, which launched a major campaign to promote public services and
to point out what it sees as the failures of privatisation, wanted its
office franking machines to send out the mail with the message ''Public
Service, not Private Sleaze.''
However, the idea was quickly stamped out by the Royal Mail, which
told Unison's Inverness office that under the authority of the Post
Office Act 1969, it could refuse any mail bearing a franked message
which could cause embarrassment to the Post Office, any Post Office
employee or an addressee.
According to Royal Mail meters policy manager Mike Tamlin, Unison's
message ''expresses a strong political view which could cause
embarrassment to individuals receiving or handling the mail concerned.''
Unison's Scottish secretary Matt Smith described the decision as
political censorship. ''Why can't we promote our product on our mail the
same way that private companies can do with theirs?'' he said.
''It seems that you can promote all sorts of private businesses and
services on the Royal Mail but when it comes to public services, the
management get nervous. Maybe they are still smarting from the defeat of
their own privatisation proposals. They are surely not saying they agree
with private sleaze.''
A Royal Mail spokesman said the ban did not imply that it had taken
any view on the rights and wrongs of the slogan but that it could not be
seen to be associating with any political messages.
''We have a legal duty to ensure such slogans do not cause offence or
embarrassment,'' he said. Slogans of a political, religious or racial
connotation, were banned, he said.
Did that mean the Church of Scotland could not frank its letters with
an uplifting slogan about Christianity? ''Each case would be dealt with
on its individual merits,'' he added cautiously.
Perhaps surprisingly, the political parties in Scotland appear willing
to accept the Royal Mail's position. Neither the Tory Party nor the SNP
carries any message on its franked mail and Labour's merely says
Scottish Labour.
One SNP official was certain he could recall ''It's Scotland's Oil''
being used to frank mail in the seventies but presumably the Royal
Mail's political detection equipment was not fully operational then.
One Unison official wondered how the Royal Mail defined what would be
offensive to the public. He believed, for example, that Scottish
Nuclear's franking message ''Generating a Better Environment for the
Next Generation'' was offensive enough for people who dislike nuclear
power.
As for the Royal Mail itself, it tends to steer clear of controversy
on its franking machines by merely enquiring if people have remembered
to use the post code.

THE big guns of the UN's Rapid Reaction Force ran out of Bosnian Serb
targets around Sarajevo 18 hours after first opening fire, a United
Nations official revealed yesterday.
''The last artillery round fired was at 10.40 on Wednesday night
because they couldn't find anything to shoot at,'' he said. ''The
weather has been lousy but mostly it's that the Serbs have now had time
to hide their remaining weapons.
''We're in a counter-battery mode now. If the Serbs fire we'll see it
and fire back. Otherwise, it's probably going to be up to Nato.''
Rapid Reaction Force artillery on Mount Igman, west of Sarajevo, fired
900 rounds against 23 targets in about 18 hours.
Artillery on Mount Igman includes 12 British 105mm artillery pieces
manned by Highland Gunners, eight French 155mm howitzers, and French and
Dutch 120mm mortars.

TEHRAN: Iran's Supreme Court has upheld a manslaughter conviction
against a former MP and ordered him to pay blood money, or diyeh, for
killing a man in an argument over shooting partridges. Under Iran's
Islamic law, diyeh is one of the following or their value as agreed by
the two sides -- 100 camels, 1000 sheep, 200 silk dresses, 1000 gold
coins, or 10,000 silver coins.

THE Government's much vaunted proposal to extend nursery education
through vouchers to parents could undermine all the recent progress in
Gaelic education, endanger many jobs in Gaelic, and could end up doing
as much damage to the language as the 1872 Education Act.
The warning came yesterday from Mr Finlay Macleod, director of
Comhairle Sgoiltean Araich, the Gaelic Pre-School Playgroups
Association, whose establishment 13 years ago is widely seen as having
done more to save the Gaelic language than any other single measure.
At present, there are 2600 children in Gaelic playgroups and around
1600 in Gaelic medium schools throughout Scotland but Mr Macleod fears
that if the proposal to introduce vouchers is implemented in its present
form the language will start to retreat again.
''Our clear experience is that when children leave a Gaelic playgroup
and go into an English medium nursery class, they will not then go on to
a Gaelic medium primary school. Once we start seeing the numbers of
children in the Gaelic medium schools going down, every person connected
with Gaelic is going to be in a very serious position; television,
teaching, everyone.''
Mr Macleod said that initially he had thought nursery vouchers would
be a major help but now realised they would be damaging. The problem was
that to make a nursery viable under the voucher system, a minimum of 20
children would be needed, and there were many communities where there
would not be 20 children, or if there were, some of the parents would
prefer an English medium nursery.

<TEXT>
A SENIOR policeman, ordered by three High Court judges to pay his
ex-wife #500 a month of a pension which he will not receive until the
year 2001, plans to appeal to the House of Lords.
The new move was revealed yesterday by Fife Detective Inspector Derek
McEwan, just two days after the judges rejected his appeal against
Kirkcaldy Sheriff Gail Patrick's original ruling.
However, the 42-year-old officer, who lives in Kirkcaldy, already
faces a legal bill of ''tens of thousands of pounds'' and says he will
need the help of a ''sponsor'' to take his battle to the country's
highest court.
Mr McEwan said: ''This judgment will affect not only me but
potentially anyone who is married and has an occupational pension, and
also flies in the face of the clean-break principle.
''At the time of my legal separation approximately five years ago, the
nett proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home were divided equally
between my ex-wife and me -- approximately #6700 each.''
He claimed that at that time and again two years later, his ex-wife
Anne, also 42, was ''offered and refused in the region of #47,500, that
is #2500 then and #45,000 upon my retirement.
''In effect, because of this judgment, overall she has 'lost'
approximately #15,000 including interest and I will now have to foot her
legal expenses as well as my own, which will amount to tens of thousands
of pounds.''
Mr McEwan also claimed, ''further evidence became available to me
after my divorce hearing which I believe would have been beneficial to
my case but which was not, unfortunately, because of the present legal
system, allowed at the appeal, which I think is unjust.
''In the meantime, I have no alternative but to lodge a note of appeal
to the House of Lords and I am actively seeking a sponsor/sponsors as I
will be unable to bear the substantial costs alone.''
When the couple, who were married for 15 years and have a son and
daughter, were divorced last year, Sheriff Patrick ruled that Mrs McEwan
was immediately entitled to a half-share of her ex-husband's police
pension rights, valued at #58,000.
Mr McEwan, who is said to live with another woman in a house with a
#75,000 mortgage, was ordered to pay the #27,000 by monthly instalments
of #500 with 8% interest but claimed he could not afford to and appealed
to the Court of Session.
Lords Penrose, Sutherland, and Brand said the sole issue was whether
the sheriff had been entitled to make the instalments order and ruled
that she had.
News of the Lords' decision was welcomed by Mrs McEwan, who lives in a
one-bedroom council flat in Methil.
She said that for four years she was unable to work due to ''stress''
and she now survived on just #99 a week from a job as a holiday complex
housekeeper.

A DEVELOPER has withdrawn his appeal to the Secretary of State for
Scotland after a plan to build 10 villas costing #1m each and four
#500,000 flats on green belt land was rejected by councillors.
A public inquiry was scheduled to be held in November. However, it
emerged yesterday that the Glasgow-based City Link Development Company
Ltd will now submit a revised plan to Stirling District Council for the
luxury homes development on grazing land at Mugdock, five miles north of
Glasgow.
A district council official confirmed yesterday that a letter had been
received from an agent acting for City Link, stating that its appeal to
the Secretary of State for Scotland concerning the Mugdock development
had been withdrawn.
Mr Ronnie McLetchie, director of the company, said yesterday: ''We are
re-appraising the site and design, and there will be a new application
going forward.''
The district council had said that the original proposal was contrary
to national planning guidelines and the local development plan.
The plan was also opposed by Strathblane Community Council, Bearsden
and Milngavie District Council, and Central Regional Council, on the
same grounds.
Stirling district's local plan specifically identified Mugdock green
belt to ''protect a key area of countryside from development''.
The council said one of the main concepts behind the approval of
Mugdock as a green belt area was to limit outward expansion from
Glasgow's suburbs and to prevent the merging of Strathblane and
Milngavie.

Chiefs at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, have revealed that the bed
shortage ''does not allow medical and nursing staff to provide the

There is an estimated shortage of 12 beds in the haematology and renal
ward at Ninewells, and patients have had to wait until a bed could be
found for them. Others have been ''boarded out'' to other wards, which a
hospital spokesman said ''impinges on the emergency medical receiving
ward and the other acute medical receiving wards, already under

Dundee Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has pledged to discuss the problem

THE Princess Royal yesterday praised the work of the Scottish
Institute of Sports Medicine and Sports Science and said the research
work they carried out to help elite sportsmen had great spin-off
benefits.
The princess, patron of the institute, was speaking at its second
three-day ''festival'', during which topics discussed by international
experts included exercising in extremes of heat and cold and the
clinical aspects of exercise in diabetes and asthma.
She addressed the conference after listening to a lecture on sports
nutrition by Dr Ron Maughan, reader in environmental and occupational
medicine at Aberdeen University. Dr Maughan highlighted the complexities
of the dietary requirements of sportsmen.
The princess said the institute had a role to play to improve this:
''There are always people who are going to be participants in sport at
some stage in their career and the potential for long-term damage either
through immediate injuries or just ignorance in terms of their own
dietary intake is considerable.''
The princess said that in relation to nutrition she had always been
intrigued by two sets of people, flat-race jockeys and Mongolians.
''Flat-race jockeys don't seem to eat at all and take surprisingly
little exercise,'' she said. ''They could actually lose weight and be
fitter but that is taking a little time to get through to them.
''The Mongolians live on dairy products and meat and nothing else. By
anyone else's standards that would be a diet that would kill you. There
are extremes into which our nutritional knowledge must fit.''
Later, the princess, who is president of the International League for
the Protection of Horses, visited Belwade Farm near Aboyne, a rest and
rehabilitation centre of the league, which she opened in 1990.

HOSPITAL radiographers yesterday voted in favour of industrial action
ahead of next week's peace talks aimed at settling the long-running
National Health Service pay dispute.
Meanwhile, a survey today reveals that people are disenchanted with
the NHS, viewing it as a two-tier system which is in decline.
Underfunding and misallocation of funds were mostly blamed for the
state of the NHS.
Around 13,000 radiographers are now poised to take action in their
fight against a 1% national pay rise, to be topped up by 2% locally.
Around 75% voted for industrial action including strikes. Turnout was
around 9000.
A spokesman for the Society of Radiographers, whose members have taken
industrial action on only three occasions in the past 75 years, said it
was likely members would carry out emergency duties only on selected
days next month.
On Wednesday, it was revealed that 30,000 therapists had voted by a
90% majority for strike action on September 21. Broadly similar ballot
results are expected over the weekend in respect of around 30,000
General Municipal and Boilermakers members and next week from about
350,000 members of Unison.
Against this background, Mr Ken Jarrold, NHS director of human
resources, has called for pay row talks to resume next Monday -- an
invitation that is expected to be accepted by most of the health union
leaders who meet in London this morning.
The position of the non-TUC Royal College of Nursing is less clear
and, while the RCN is expected to attend today's union meeting, the
signs are that it might decide against participating in next week's
proposed talks.
The RCN, which recently changed its rules to allow industrial action,
shows no sign of staging a ballot and is more intent on pressing for 3%
local deals which if sufficiently widespread could be seen as a de facto
3% national deal.
Last night, the RCN was claiming to have received 272 ''3% no
strings'' offers and to be nearing the ''critical mass'' of 300 at which
it plans to start accepting them. However, it concedes that there are
areas like Scotland where 3% without strings is a rarity and where
''much work still needs to be done''.
Commenting on the latest ballot result, Mr Stephen Evans, general
secretary of the Society of Radiographers, said: ''This ballot gives a
clear indication to the Government of the strength of feeling among
radiographers.''
About 95% of those who took part in the NHS poll felt more money
should be made available for health services.
However, only 51% believed a change of Government would affect the
standard of service.
The survey was conducted on behalf of private medical insurers BCWA
(Bristol Contributary Welfare Association).
Market analysts Mintel questioned a nationally representative sample
of 2051 adults aged 18 to 54.
They found evidence that the private health insurance market was
growing as people lost faith with the NHS.
About 6.6 million Britons are now covered by private medical
insurance.

GLASGOW'S Town Clerk has denied there has been political interference
in an investigation of financial irregularities in a number of
Easterhouse community projects.
He was responding to questions from Conservative councillors who,
along with other opposition members, are alarmed that large sums of
public money appear to be unaccounted for.
An auditor's report on the allegations has been passed to the police.
In an unprecedented move earlier this week, all four parties --
Conservative, Liberal, Militant, and SNP -- sent a joint letter to
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth protesting that Militant councillor
Charles Stevenson was denied the right to ask questions when a council
committee was considering the matter.
At yesterday's full council meeting, the Conservative leader,
Councillor William Aitken, wanted to know when the auditor's report on
the matter was first seen by a senior member of the administration.
He also asked if there had been any attempt to suppress or delay
publication of the report's findings. In his view, this would result in
the council losing confidence in the member of the administration who
was responsible and would require to ask for his or her resignation.
However, the Town Clerk, Mr Tom Monaghan, firmly rejected any
suggestion of political interference.
He said he had not circulated the auditor's report to any member of
the council and asserted that there had been no political interference
in respect of that report.
Councillor Aitken said later: ''This matter is going to be pursued
until it comes out in the open in its entirety. The way it has been
handled leaves a very bad taste.

FORMER Labour MP Bryan Gould has accepted undisclosed damages and
costs from London's Evening Standard newspaper over an article attacking
party leader Tony Blair which was wrongly attributed to him.
The Standard, in a joint statement with Mr Gould, acknowledged that
publication of the article -- actually written by Home Secretary Michael
Howard's son -- under his name had caused him ''considerable distress''.
The statement said: ''Readers of the article were seriously misled as
to Mr Gould's view of the present leadership and politics of the Labour
Party and what Mr Gould would be saying in his book, which is about to
be published.''
It added that, for his part, Mr Gould accepted that the paper had made
a ''genuine error'' which it corrected as soon as it was discovered.
The mistake, which occurred earlier this month, happened because of a
mix-up over faxes arriving at the Standard's office in London.
The error did not come to light for several days because neither Mr
Gould, who is now pursuing an academic career in New Zealand, nor the
article's real author, 19-year-old Nick Howard, was in the country when
it was published.

AN Aberdeen company has been told to pay #21,670 compensation to a
sacked North Sea oil platform supervisor and also ordered to reinstate
him.
Kelvin International Services, of Queen's Terrace, sacked Mr John
Stephenson, of St Josephs Court, Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, in August 1994
for gross misconduct.
Mr Stephenson started work in 1987 with the company, which provides
catering and hotel services to offshore installations.
He was one of the facility supervisors on the Alba Northern platform
operated by Chevron and ran the Bond -- a small room with a serving
hatch, normally open at meal times, which sold sweets, stationery, and
telephone cards.
On May 27, 1994, a mechanic inspecting the roof space above the Bond
found a box containing 200 phone cards.
When a check was made of the BT cards held by the helicopter landing
officer, 600 were found to be missing.
After investigation, Mr Beach, a handyman on the platform, admitted
stealing a box of BT phone cards from the helicopter landing officer's
safe, after the keys had been left unattended, and selling them in the
Bond.
Mr Stephenson was then called to a disciplinary meeting on August 4,
1994, and sacked. His appeal against dismissal failed because Miss
Caroline Black, the divisional director, felt Mr Beach was protecting
the supervisor.
The tribunal, in deciding Mr Stephenson had been dismissed unfairly,
stated: ''The Bond also doubled as an office with the result that the
applicant was not the only person with access.
''The applicant had allowed Mr Beach, whom he trusted, to serve from
the Bond and Mr Beach had undoubtedly sold some of the missing cards.''
A Mr Gordon Fyvie also had keys to the Bond but wasn't interviewed in
connection with the theft and neither was the helicopter landing
officer.
The tribunal added: ''This matter caused us some concern and we were
not convinced that an employer carrying out a reasonable investigation
would have failed to interview either of these gentlemen.
''We are not satisfied that the employer had carried out as much
investigation as was reasonable in the circumstances of this case. The
application therefore succeeds.''

A 23-YEAR-OLD man found dead after taking one of medicine's strongest
painkillers was warned about the dangers of drugs, his father said
yesterday. The drug also left three teenagers seriously ill in hospital.
Mr Daryl Elliott, a father of two children, was found collapsed beside
his unconscious 16-year-old girl friend on Wednesday by his mother at
her home in Birtley, near Gateshead.
His father, Christopher, 46, said he had often warned his son, an
amateur boxer and fitness enthusiast, of the dangers of drugs.
''I told him not to be stupid by taking drugs because he couldn't
train properly.
''I was not surprised to hear about these drugs because he has been
like that before.
''Daryl has come here a couple of times and you could tell that he had
taken something,'' Mr Elliott added.
The morphine sulphate tablets, a pure form of opium, are used in
cancer treatment.
Police said Mr Elliott's girlfriend was lucky to be alive. She
swallowed up to three tablets but survived because she was lying on her
side and not on her back with her airway blocked when she collapsed.
Another girl, a single mother, and a boy, both aged 16 have been taken
off the critical list in the intensive care unit at the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital, Gateshead.
All four victims knew each other and were from the villages of
Wrekenton and Birtley.
Police yesterday issued urgent warnings to parents to check that their
children had not bought any of the fluorescent blue and green tablets.
The alert began when Mr Elliott and his girlfriend were found
suffering from apparent overdoses.
At hospital, it was found the other two teenagers had been admitted in
the early hours of the morning suffering from the same symptoms.
Detective Inspector Gil Smith said of the drug: ''A single tablet is
enough to be life-threatening.
''It is highly dangerous and there may well have been other youngsters
who have bought them. It could still be in circulation.''
Police have urged parents whose children may suffer from vomiting or
sleeplessness to contact a hospital immediately.
Detectives yesterday were questioning a man about the illegal sale of
tablets.

LANARKSHIRE is finally moving into what is called its ''post-steel
economy'' with the local development agency yesterday announcing a
successful year for attracting firms to the county.
Mr Ian Livingstone, chairman of Lanarkshire Development Agency, said
they were burying the image of ''darkest Lanarkshire'' with significant
new employment and investment.
LDA's annual report, issued yesterday, said 29 inward investment
projects had been attracted to the county which would lead to the
creation of more than 2000 jobs.
Manufacturing exports from Lanarkshire firms continued to rise and 274
new business ventures were launched with LDA support.
The railfreight link to the Channel Tunnel was running five scheduled
services to the Continent, and Strathclyde Business Park, one of LDA's
biggest successes, had so far attracted 50 firms employing 1000 people.
In addition, Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone -- a series of sites which
give companies tax breaks, rates holidays, and other incentives -- was
beginning to take off. Seventeen companies are moving to the sites,
creating more than 2200 jobs in the next three years.
One criticism of enterprise zones in the past was that they simply
displaced jobs from one part of the country to another. LDA claims its
vetting policies have ensured that as many of the jobs as possible are
new.
The agency spent more than #51m in the past financial year including
#15m on training schemes for the unemployed and #14m on creating the
various business sites.
The next critical phase for the agency is the redevelopment of the
Ravenscraig steelworks site. British Steel has begun demolishing the
buildings and, in a few days, will be issued with the waste licence
which allows it to move the contaminated materials on site.
Much of the contaminated soil will simply be moved to areas where
there will be no building, and grassed over. The concrete in the large
cooling towers will probably be used as bottoming for new roads on the
site and infilling basement areas.
The development agency, with the local council and British Steel, will
start redeveloping the site next year, once British Steel has finished
the initial demolition and decontamination work.
Yet to be decided is when the site's landmark, the large blue
gasometer with Ravenscraig written on the side, will come down.
LDA chief executive Archie Bethel would prefer it was demolished
immediately, to let people know that redevelopment has started. Others
have become quite attached to it and prefer it to remain as a totem for
as long as possible. British Steel has the final say.
Not all the news was good for Lanarkshire last year. Large inward
investments by Samsung and Siemens considered Lanarkshire but plumped
instead for North-east England.
Mr Bethel agreed that such losses were disappointing but said he was
confident that any major mobile investment in Europe would be looking at
Lanarkshire and that eventually their turn would come.
Other bad news was the departure of Hayward Tyler from East Kilbride
and the closure of Rolls-Royce's aero engine design division.
''They are stark reminders that jobs are still being lost,'' said Mr
Livingstone. ''There is certainly no room for complacency.''

THE provision of important diagnostic equipment for Ayr Hospital moves
a step closer today with a donation from the Women's Royal Voluntary
Service.
A cheque for #100,000 will be handed over to Mr Douglas Brown,
chairman of South Ayrshire Hospitals Trust, towards Magnetic Resonance
Imaging equipment.
The equipment is being funded jointly by trust and public funds and
will be available to patients in Ayrshire and beyond.
Mr Brown, a former orthopaedic surgeon, said: ''MRI produces a
high-quality image which will allow our surgeons and physicians to make
speedier diagnoses and treatment for our patients.
''It will be especially helpful in orthopaedics, vascular, ENT, and
soft tissue injury and can indeed avoid the need for actual explorative
surgery because of its clarity and definition.
''The support of the WRVS to this hospital is really phenomenal. Last
year, they gave us #80,000, which went on eye equipment.''
Sir Donald McLean, chairman of Ayrshire Medical Support, which is
involved in the project, said: ''The joint investment of over #1m is a
real boost for medicine and importantly patients in Ayrshire.''

BATHERS are taking the plunge in cleaner waters in Scotland, according
to a Scottish Office report published yesterday.
In the last seven years, the number of bathing waters meeting EU
standards has increased by 18% in Scotland.
Last year, 70% of waters complied with European standards compared to
52% in 1988.
Scottish Environment Minister Lord Lindsay said: ''Families coming to
the seaside to let their children swim or paddle want the reassurance
that the sea is clean and unpolluted by sewage.''
Over the last two years, all bathing waters on Scotland's east coast
have met European standards and it is hoped that investment will result
in similar results on the Ayrshire coast.
Lord Lindsay launched the report ''Scottish Bathing Waters: Progress
Towards Compliance'' at Arbroath beach yesterday.
Waters at the Angus town failed to meet EU standards before a new
sewage outfall became operational four years ago.
Lord Lindsay pledged the pace of investment to improve waters over the
next 10 to 15 years would quicken and estimated that funds needed would
be around #5000m.
He added: ''The rewards, however, will be bathing water of
unparalleled quality and safety and a sewerage infrastructure ready to
meet public hygiene standards well into the next century.
''The new water authorities have the expertise to implement this
massive programme and the Government expects them to meet the challenge
as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.''
Private sector money is also expected to play a significant role in
the investment.

MURDER squad detectives based in Torbay, Devon, last night flew from
RAF Brize Norton to the Falkland Islands, to investigate the
disappearance of a Royal Marine -- 18 months before the outbreak of war
with Argentina.
''A lot of people on the Falklands have been harbouring a secret for a
long time and we are now hoping that we can get to the bottom of it,'' a
spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said yesterday.
''We are not sending officers on an 8000-mile journey for nothing.''
Marine Alan Addis, 19, from Hull, went missing on a remote settlement
of the Falklands 15 years ago.
Police hope the sacrifice of British troops in retaking the Falklands
might encourage islanders to search their consciences and, finally, come
forward with the truth of what happened that evening.
In 1980, Marine Addis and fellow commandos took a small steamer from
Port Stanley to the remote North Arm community on East Falkland.
They knew that a ceilidh was to take place and, in those pre-war days
in the Falklands, this was a big night out.
He was one of a party of six commandos training local volunteers to
protect the islands from invasion but their tour of duty was about to
end and they were out for a good time.
There is no doubt that a lot of drink was taken that evening. Most
seemed to have a good time. However, on the journey back to Stanley, it
was noticed that Marine Addis was not on board.
An inquiry was conducted by the local police force -- which at that
time consisted of one man, trained by Devon and Cornwall Police, and one
other.
The initial report suggested Marine Addis must have died in an
accident. However, his body was not recovered.
Mrs Ann Addis, mother of the marine, who is now presumed dead, was not
prepared to let the matter rest and has been campaigning for the
investigation to be re-opened.
As a consequence, the Royal Falkland Island Police, now a force of 17,
did re-open its files and sent a report to the Devon and Cornwall
constabulary -- which has trained the officers who have moved to the
island since the war with Argentina -- and new lines of inquiry were
opened.
In all, more than 50 people were interviewed in the UK. They include
former Marines and one-time residents of the Falklands who had returned
to Britain.
Never at any stage has it been suggested the colleagues of Marine
Addis may have been involved in what is now, clearly, a murder inquiry.
Police suspect residents know more than they have been prepared to say.
As a consequence, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Pennington and
Detective Sergeant Steve Turpin are to continue the inquiry. They will
be followed shortly by two constables who will, via satellite, be able
to link with the Home Office's major incident computer system.
While they are following a cold trail, it was made clear last night
that fresh information had opened up new leads.
A spokesman said: ''We are hopeful that this will lead to a definite
conclusion. At the very least, we would hope to recover Alan's body,
which would bring some comfort to his mother.''
Prior to the detectives visit, Mrs Addis made an emotional plea on
video, urging those who might throw light on her son's death to come
forward.

<HEADLINE>Lawyer fails in #100,000 damages bid.  No ruling on who will pay for legal costs.</HEADLINE>

A SOLICITOR has failed to win #100,000 in damages from a rival lawyer,
who is said to have described him as ''a conman and an arsehole'', and
he could now face a #50,000 bill for legal costs.
Lawyers and former friends John Justice and Tom Boyd, who practise in
the Angus town of Kirriemuir, fell out over the sale of a local bakery,
and later comments that Mr Boyd is said to have made about Mr Justice.
Mr Justice sued Mr Boyd for #100,000, claiming defamation, in a case
which centred on letters from Mr Boyd to the Law Society, comments made
by Mr Boyd to a woman client, and a statement allegedly made by Mr Boyd
in a local hotel.
However, Sheriff John McInnes has ruled that Mr Justice is not
entitled to damages as he failed to prove that Mr Boyd was motivated by
malice.
The sheriff has reserved his judgment on the question of who will foot
the hefty bill for costs of the six-day action, heard in January, May,
and July this year.
Last night, Mr Justice said that he was contemplating an appeal
against the sheriff's ruling and admitted that he feared ''a potentially
very large'' expenses bill ''in the region of #50,000'' for the failed
action.
Sheriff McInnes accepted that Mr Boyd had described Mr Justice and
another solicitor as ''conmen and arseholes'' in a conversation in the
Thrums Hotel, Kirriemuir, in October 1992.
He criticised Mr Boyd as ''a man who at times is prone to be impetuous
and to use language which is stronger than necessary, with the result he
may offend people, perhaps without realising he has done so''.
Sheriff McInnes added: ''In short, he struck me as a man who may at
times be insensitive to the feelings of others.''
However, the sheriff concluded: ''I am not satisfied that what Mr Boyd
said on that occasion demonstrates malice towards Mr Justice.''
Mr Boyd, a partner in Wilkie and Dundas solicitors, and Mr Justice,
the sole practitioner of Hambley's law firm, were former friends and
their offices are yards apart in the centre of the Angus town of
Kirriemuir.
Mr Justice last night commented: ''I am disappointed at the result. It
was an action which was raised in July 1993 and which has lasted a long
time.
''I have 14 days in which to consider an appeal to the Court of
Session and I will be taking advice from my QC.''
He added: ''A lot of the case hinged on whether malice could be proved
and the letters sent to the Law Society had qualified privilege.
''It was the 'conmen and arseholes' remark that prompted me to raise
an action.
''As a point of principle, I felt that I had to take action to stop
him saying such things again.''
Mr Justice has now sold his house in Kirriemuir and is considering
whether or not to continue his career as a lawyer.
Last night, his rival, Mr Tom Boyd, said: ''The sheriff's decision is
satisfactory.'' He added that an appeal by Mr Justice was ''not
unexpected''.
Asked if he stuck by the description of Mr Justice as ''an arsehole
and conman'' attributed to him, Mr Boyd replied: ''We did not lead any
evidence regarding the allegations made by Mr Justice.''

A TEENAGER was ordered to be detained for six years yesterday for his
part in a vicious assault on a former Hibernian footballer.
Ian MacKenzie, 17, admitted kicking 25-year-old Cameron Stevenson on
the head and body to his severe injury and permanent impairment outside
a nightclub in Lothian Road, Edinburgh, on April 16 this year.
The Crown accepted that the brain injuries suffered by the victim had
been caused by stamping and jumping on his head, for which MacKenzie, of
Great Junction Street, Leith, was not responsible.
Temporary Judge Hazel Aronson had deferred sentence for background
reports and yesterday, at the High Court in Edinburgh, told MacKenzie he
had repeatedly kicked his victim as he lay on the ground.
Originally, six men were charged with attempting to murder Mr
Stevenson, who played for Hibernian's second team between the ages of 15
and 17. He was punched and kicked and repeatedly stamped on and jumped
on as he lay helpless on the ground.
He was in a coma following the assault and suffered brain injuries
which have left him with memory and speech difficulties.
During the trial, the jury was shown a video film of the attack,
captured by security cameras on the roof of a nearby department store.
Two other men who were involved in the incident were also sentenced
yesterday.
Paul Fisher, 22, of Hutchison Grove, Edinburgh, who admitted kicking
Mr Stevenson on the body, had sentence deferred for a year. The Judge
accepted that he had not been involved in the more serious part of the
attack which caused the severe injuries.
A third man, James Ketchen, 20, of Wester Drylaw Drive, Edinburgh, was
ordered to be detained for three months after he admitted kicking Mr Ian
Sutherland, in a related incident in Lothian Road, on April 16.
Ketchen, who is already serving seven years for assaults in Edinburgh
streets, was cleared of attacking Mr Stevenson.
Mr Sutherland told the court that he was attacked after trying to get
help for Mr Stevenson. He said one of his attackers told him: ''We are
Hibs.''

THE link between poor housing conditions and an increased level of
crime on some estates is spelled out in a new report by the Chartered
Institute of Housing.
It stresses that the poorest council tenants are six times as likely
to be burgled as those living in affluent suburbs.
Localities rife with crime, says the report, are frequently places
with the least resources to fight back as better-off tenants quit the
area.
To try to improve the situation the institute yesterday called for a
partnership between different groups to improve security, management,
and design on the UK's housing estates and substantially reduce crime in
the process.
It highlighted Dundee District Council's schemes, especially on the
Whitfield estate, to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour.
Housebreaking and total reported crime there had been cut while
security patrols had helped reduce vandalism costs by 60%.
However, the report claims that, in general, council housing has
become the preserve of the poor.
Ms Christine Laird, chief executive of the institute, said: ''Lack of
resources for design, security, and management initiatives has produced
a lack of resistance to crime on the poorest estates.
She warned: ''We are in the process of creating not only crime-ridden
estates of last resort but also a tenure of last resort, namely local
authority housing.''
Shelter Scotland said the report did not sufficiently address the
place local authority housing had in Scotland.
Many Scots still chose to live in council housing -- a choice which
was increasingly being denied to them by lack of Government investment.

A STRANDED motorist picked up the roadside telephone, pressed the
button for the AA -- tagged the Fourth Emergency Service -- and got the
speaking clock . . . repeatedly.
Finally, the frustrated driver, who had elderly passengers, including
one who was disabled, hit the button marked police, only to get the
unobtainable tone.
Mr Ross Wilson, a Windsor-based chartered accountant, who is in
Scotland on holiday, eventually raised the alarm by using a mobile
telephone to alert the motoring organisation's headquarters in
Basingstoke, Hampshire.
A recovery van turned up after 45 minutes at the lay-by near Fenwick
Moor, on the A77 Glasgow to Stranraer road, where AA box number 517 is
sited.
Mr Wilson, 46, who was with his wife, youngest son, and
parents-in-law, from Blantyre, said: ''It would be funny if it wasn't so
serious. I was flabbergasted to find the only response to hitting the
buttons was to be told the time or to get nothing at all.''
He had tried to contact the AA after turning in to the lay-by because
of a puncture and finding he could not remove the wheel.
Mr Wilson said: ''At least it happened in broad daylight and, thanks
to the mobile telephone, we did not have to drive on with a flat tyre.''
Yesterday, the AA admitted the telephone fault had been known for ''a
couple of days'', and said an investigation into the circumstances was
under way.
A spokesman for the organisation, which champions its advanced
technology in a drive for greater safety, said: ''We deeply regret that
it was out of action.''

<TEXT>
CELTIC have been urged to pull out of their European Cup Winners' Cup
first-round clash with Georgian club Dynamo Butami -- by their own
supporters.
The club has asked fans to delay booking tickets to the war-torn
region -- which has also been hit by a diptheria epidemic -- for the
first leg on September 14.
Civil war has been raging in Georgia since 1991 and the country's
leader was injured in a car bomb explosion this week in the capital
Tbilisi.
Mr Gerry Madden, of the Celtic Supporters' Association, said: ''Maybe
Celtic should just say they'll pull out of the tournament for the safety
of the players.
''If it's unsafe for the fans to travel, then it must be unsafe for
the players as well and they too have families. Perhaps this is an
occasion when Celtic should make a stand.''
The official party will fly to Tbilisi then take a hazardous six-hour
drive to reach the Black Sea resort of Batumi but Mr Madden said the
difficulties of making the trip would not deter the fans.
''If Celtic do play the tie, they know there is no way they will stop
supporters travelling, because people who have made their minds up will
do their best to get there.
''It would be hypocritical of me to tell supporters not to travel
because if possible I will be there but I would say to anyone wishing to
go to take as much protection as possible.''
Celtic, whose request to have the tie switched to another venue was
turned down by Uefa, still are waiting to hear from security adviser
George Douglas, who has visited Georgia to assess the situation.

THE syndicate which lost out on a #2.3m pools jackpot when a coupon
collector failed to put on their line, has raised the money to take on
Littlewoods in the civil courts and is hiring a top QC.
The dreams of the five ScottishPower workers in Falkirk were shattered
when Littlewoods, which never received the winning coupon, refused to
pay out and insisted it did not employ collectors.
The pools giant claimed: ''They are the agents of the client, not
Littlewoods.''
Yesterday, Mrs Mary Ferguson, wife of syndicate member John, from
Dunipace, Stirlingshire, said: ''We have now raised the #35,000 to take
on Littlewoods.''
The syndicate's Glasgow-based solicitor, Mr Cameron Fyfe, confirmed:
''I am now consulting a QC in regard to a civil court action on behalf
of the syndicate.''
Collector Cameron Baxter, 27, of Stirling, pled guilty at the High
Court in Edinburgh, last week, and will be sentenced this month.

FILM star Mel Gibson is being pressed into the cause of Scots
independence in a leaflet campaign based on his role as William Wallace
in the film Braveheart, which has its European premiere at Stirling on
Sunday.
His picture appears on a leaflet which SNP activists will distribute
outside screenings of the film, proclaiming that ''independence isn't
just history''.
The star's photograph is central to the SNP handbill, gazing out from
the leaflet in a plea: ''Independence -- we need it more than ever.''
The party made it clear yesterday that it was not advocating the
broadsword as a way forward, pointing to its wording in the cinema
handbill: ''Today it's not just bravehearts who choose independence --
it's also wise heads, and they use the ballot box.''
The SNP plans to distribute the leaflet outside cinemas all over
Scotland to build on the sentiment generated by the Hollywood treatment

They have even taken the precaution of making use of a specific
photograph of Mel Gibson in the central role which is not copyright of
the film-makers themselves.
However, SNP chief executive Michael Russell said yesterday that he
expected no intervention from the film-makers, as party canvassers were
planning to hand out the leaflets around screenings without making
trouble.

THE headmaster who gagged a pupil with sticky tape and was convicted
of assault will not know his career prospects for another two months.
Alex Christie, 46, was convicted of assault and fined #350 at Falkirk
Sheriff Court on June 12 after the classroom incident in February.
Christie, head of Carmuirs Primary School in Falkirk, is suspended on
full pay pending investigations by his employers, Central Regional
Council, and the General Teaching Council.
Yesterday, it emerged that the region was waiting for the outcome of
the GTC's investigation, which was not expected for two months.
A region spokeswoman said: ''We are awaiting the result of the GTC
investigation.
''Any decision we might make would be pointless if, for example, Mr
Christie were struck off.''
An outcome is expected by late October or early November.
The headmaster was standing in for another teacher at the school when
he gagged the 10-year-old boy for being a chatterbox.
He made the young pupil stand for 10 minutes before removing the tape.
The youngster's mother reported the incident to police.
Mr Christie has refused to comment until disciplinary proceedings are
complete.

TWO balloonists hopped over Britain's highest mountain yesterday --
and set a new record on the way.
No-one had ever managed to fly a hot air balloon over the summit of
Ben Nevis before.
Pilot James Ireland and team leader Christian Brown of Richard
Branson's Virgin Ballooning Team became the first men to make the flight
over the Roof of Britain.
Mr Ireland said: ''It was an incredibly difficult flight because of
the shifting wind currents as you rise through the glen. We made it in
the end but it was touch and go whether we would get over the summit.''
Low cloud covered the top of the ben at the original launch time of
5am, so the team waited to see if the weather improved. At 6.30, Mr
Ireland decided to give it a try, although the clouds were still within
a few feet of the lofty peak.
As the 94ft-tall balloon neared the summit of the 4406ft high
mountain, a sudden gust of wind threatened to blow it off course.
Mr Ireland, one of only a handful of professional hot air pilots in
Britain, needed every bit of his years of ballooning experience to avoid
getting swept away from the peak.
However, he pulled the craft around and cruised over the summit,
missing the cairn on top by inches.
Mr Brown said: ''It is a great feeling to do something no-one else has
done before. The only disappointment was that there was nobody on the
summit as we went over -- but it was early in the morning.''

A 1996 summer holiday price war broke out yesterday -- only days after
most of the brochures were sent out.
After leading high street travel agent Going Places announced 10% off
many prices, rival A T Mays yesterday said it would cut up to 12% from
several Mediterranean packages.
The reductions will apply to the thousands of holidays which go on
sale today following the launch of brochures by most leading tour
operators this week.
Early bookers can cancel out the near-10% increase in Spanish prices
that the companies have been forced to introduce.
Later, Going Places and rivals Lunn Poly announced discounts of up to
12%, with Going Places later raising its cuts to 14% on some holidays.
Mays' 12% discounts apply to Sunworld's Greece and Beach Villas
brochures and also to First Choice's Freespirit holidays, selected
Cosmos breaks, and Inspirations' Balearic Islands and Spanish mainland
holidays.
It is also taking 10% off brochure prices of virtually every other
leading holiday company, including Thomson, Airtours, and First Choice.
''With fewer holidays on offer for next summer, this is a good time to
book early,'' said Mays' managing director Jamie Moffat.
Launching Thomson's brochures on Wednesday, managing director Charles
Newbold had been scathing of the quality of British resorts.

DRUGS traffickers were given a blunt message by Chief Constable Leslie
Sharp yesterday -- there will be nowhere to hide in Strathclyde.
Mr Sharp was speaking at the launch of the enforcement phase of
Operation Eagle, the Strathclyde Police initiative to reduce the supply
and demand of drugs and end the misery they cause.
For the next 90 days, Mr Sharp's officers will be increasing their
efforts to crack down on dealers and enforce drugs legislation through
both covert and high-profile police operations.
The chief constable, speaking at a drugs seminar in Ayr organised by
the local police in an area which had 13 drugs-related deaths last year,
warned dealers that every officer under his command was committed to
this important phase of the operation.
He said: ''We have vast resources at our disposal and by targeting
them all at the drugs dealers, I have not the slightest doubt we shall
make a very significant impact.''
Mr Sharp said officers had been given specialist training and that the
necessary equipment to tackle dealers would be available to the 15
divisions of the force.
Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Orr, newly appointed force drugs
co-ordinator, said: ''Dealers or traffickers in Strathclyde should be in
no doubt that they will be tracked down and brought to justice.
''We will be using the most modern and sophisticated equipment
available -- vehicles, surveillance and communications equipment, and
hydraulic machinery -- to open doors of homes which are sometimes like
fortresses to protect drug dealers.
''Doors don't get kicked in any more, they get opened up quietly and
the police are in before anyone knows what is going on and can try to
get rid of evidence.''
Mr Orr said many young officers showed extraordinary bravery in drugs
operations by blending in with the scene and making test buys of drugs.
The chief constable praised public response to Operation Eagle but
called for more assistance during the enforcement phase which would rely
heavily on information from the community.
''We realise that during an operation of such a nature, many people
who use drugs for their own personal use are likely to come to our
attention. I make no apology for that as such persons are breaking the
law, are an invaluable source of information about drugs dealers, and
can be referred to counselling and rehabilitative centres,'' he said.
Mr Sharp called for an end to the ''dithering and agonising'' over the
question of legalising or de-criminalising drugs and for everyone
concerned to get on with the job of doing something positive about drugs
problems.
Dr Leo Murray, consultant in the accident and emergency department at
Ayr Hospital, painted a black picture of the local drugs problem:
''Almost every day, I have to deal with young people who have decided to
get aff their heids with a cocktail of substances.''
The seminar heard that the Scottish Office has re-affirmed its support
for Operation Eagle and the battle against drugs and Sheriff Neil Gow,
QC, said the bench would be playing its part in the process.
The sheriff added: ''I am in no doubt that sentences will be getting
heavier to reflect society's unwillingness to accept people who deal in
drugs.''
Mr Jack Drummond, uncle of Andrew Stoddart, one of three young men who
died after taking ecstasy at Ayr's Hanger 13 last year, gave the family
perspective and said Andrew's parents live ''just an existence'' having
failed to come to terms with their son's untimely death.
He thanked local police officers for their help and assistance when
Andrew died and called for more Government money to be put into fighting
the drugs war.
Mr Drummond ended with a stark message: ''A generation of fine young
people are being destroyed by drugs. Please do not take the risk, don't
put your parents through the pain and trauma and remember, if you don't
buy the sellers can't sell.''

PRISONERS in Scottish jails are to face random mandatory testing for
drugs, backed up by punishments for refusal or testing positive,
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth announced yesterday.
His plan to crack down on what is now acknowledged as a running sore
inside prisons, causing tensions and violence, has the support of the
independent prisons inspector, Mr Clive Fairweather, who stated
separately: ''I think it would be dangerous to leave it much longer.''
Speaking from Shotts prison, which along with Glenochil was once
recognised as the most volatile in the Scottish system, Mr Forsyth said:
''I am determined to tackle this problem.
''Drug abusers need support to enable them to recover from their
addiction and the Scottish Prison Service has a number of programmes
which aim to provide that. But these need to be accompanied by a clear
message that drug taking in prison will not be tolerated.''
Mr Forsyth was responding to concerns expressed by Mr Fairweather in
his annual report.
Both men rejected suggestions that there was a clash of ideologies
between them over prison numbers.
Mr Forsyth made his position clear in an interview in The Herald on
Monday that there was a duty to make more prison space available in
Scotland to meet the disposals of the courts, while a central point in
Mr Fairweather's annual report, issued yesterday, was that fewer people
should be sent to prison.
However, Mr Forsyth said they were in agreement that people who had
committed serious or violent offences should be given long sentences
while there were others now in the system, such as fine defaulters, for
whom prison was inappropriate.
The idea touted by some Labour politicians that the courts should look
at overcrowding before determining prison sentences was unacceptable.
From their respective viewpoints, both men emphasised the need to set
in place regimes and programmes in the prisons which would allow drug
misusers to tackle their addiction with a clear objective of putting
people back into the community who had dealt with their problems and
were less likely to reoffend.
Asked where the extra money would come from to run testing and
rehabilitation programmes, Mr Forsyth said it would come from the
taxpayer who was already paying more than #26,000 a year for each
prisoner and had the right to expect value for money. That included
getting prisoners off drink and drugs.
He added that, at the first opportunity, he would introduce the
mandatory urine testing powers by statutory instrument, the powers to do
so having been given in the Criminal Justice Act.
He had asked the SPS chief executive, Mr Edward Frizzell, to bring
forward a phased programme with the aim of testing 10% of prisoners a
year.
He rejected the idea that random urine testing would cause
instability. The Home Office experience in the eight English prisons
where it had been done was that many prisoners welcomed it.
In a wide-ranging report, Mr Fairweather earlier said it was probable
that the extent of drug abuse in some Scottish prisons could be greater
than in the community as the concentration of those involved in the drug
culture was greater. He singled out boredom in even the best of prisons
as a potent factor.
The prison reform group, Sacro, welcomed Mr Fairweather's recognition
that fewer fine defaulters and short-term prisoners should be kept
inside by developing more alternative schemes.
Labour's Scottish home affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, MP for
Dumbarton, said: ''There is a hollow ring to Mr Forsyth's statements
because there is no real commitment to new resources. If he is going to
convince us that he is Granny and not the Wolf, he will have to come up
with more positive measures backed up with new money.''
Former prisoner and editor of The Prisoners' Handbook, Mr Mark Leech,
said of Mr Forsyth's drug-testing measure: ''While it is to be applauded
in principle, in practice it will lead to dangerous situations
developing and possibly to riots like those last seen in the late
1980s.''

Meanwhile, the Borders textile town of Hawick was plunged into gloom
last night with the announcement of another 100 job losses at the
knitwear company Pringle of Scotland.
There will be 92 job losses among production and warehouse workers in
Hawick, plus nine job losses at Berwick. The Galashiels finishing site
is to close and in addition Hawick and Berwick will go on to a four-day
week from this Monday.
The redundancies follow a total of 500 Scottish job cuts by the parent
company Dawson International in May -- nearly 100 in Hawick -- which
also saw Dawson managing director Nick Kuenssberg and Pringle managing
director Graham Hayward leaving with severance deals worth more than
#1m.
In addition to the Pringle cuts Hawick has suffered, this summer has
seen the loss of nearly 150 other jobs at Dawson United Brands and a
major abattoir.
Last night, provost Myra Turnbull said: ''The latest Pringle
redundancies are a body blow to Hawick and the four-day week is also bad
news for families and will have a knock-on effect on shops and other
businesses in the town. I had a meeting with Pringle's new managing
director Peter Forrest after the May job losses and we all hoped then
that those painful cuts would be the end of it. Today's news is
desperately disappointing.''
Pringle, which announced substantial operating losses earlier this
year for the first time in its history, describes yesterday's cuts as
part of a series of measures to reduce costs and improve operating
efficiency.
A Pringle spokesperson said that, without giving cast-iron guarantees,
the management team believed yesterday's measures should see the end of
job cuts and an upturn in the fortunes of Pringle and its remaining 1300
workers. Pringle bosses will have a meeting in Hawick today with Mr
Harry Donaldson, chief textiles negotiator of the GMB union.
Mr Donaldson said last night: ''We will do everything we can to resist
these redundancies and I will be seeking a change of heart tomorrow.
Most of the men and women involved earn around #300 a week and will be
going into the job market with very small redundancy payments in a town
that has been hit by a succession of job losses in the past six months.
There will be significant hardship.''

BRITISH Aerospace yesterday won a #650m order to supply regional jets
to Belgian national carrier Sabena.
The deal will safeguard 2500 jobs -- including 400 at Prestwick -- at
a time when BAe is in the throes of a major regional aircraft upheaval.
Sabena is taking 23 BAe RJ85s which are built by the company's
regional jet subsidiary Avro.
The lion's share of the jobs, around 1900, are at Woodford, near
Manchester, where the 82-seater jets are assembled. The rest are at
Prestwick where the wings are built, and Filton, Bristol, where the
central fuselages are made.
Four of the jets will be delivered to Sabena by the end of 1995 and
all will have been delivered by the end of 1998.
News of the deal was welcomed at Prestwick by the head of public
affairs, Mr Peter Black. He said: ''This is great news on several
fronts. It will be more work coming through the door and will safeguard
jobs and increase our viability when we are competing with other
manufacturers. Sadly, I cannot say it will create new jobs.''
Avro's chief executive, Mr Michael Donovan, said: ''This order is a
major export achievement for the UK aerospace industry and for Avro in
particular.
''It helps underpin the remarkable progress our employees have made in
the turnaround of BAe's regional jet business.''
The order is just the boost BAe needs as it strives to get the EU to
agree its joint venture scheme with ATR, the Franco-Italian aircraft
manufacturer.
The scheme, announced last January, is expected to mean the loss of
1000 BAe jobs.

<HEADLINE>ScottishPower pulls out of new #25m electricity station project as Government grant is refused. Human remains for generating plant</HEADLINE>

HOSPITAL waste, including human remains, will be part of the fuel for
a new electricity generating station planned for Scotland next year.
Dundee District Council is negotiating for finance for the #25m plant
to replace its incinerator at Baldovie.
This will be necessary to meet EU emission rules which come into force
in December, 1996. It would mean severed limbs, diseased organs and
aborted foetuses joining other waste to feed power into the grid.
However ScottishPower, one of the parties originally involved, said
last night that it had pulled out after the project failed to get a
Government grant awarded for power-generation using non-fossil fuels.
Meantime, Baldovie has given a lifeline to Greater Glasgow Health
Board, whose eight hospital incinerators will have to close because of
interim regulations which come into force from the end of this month.
Only an eleventh-hour agreement with Dundee District Council --
expected to be concluded over the next few days -- will solve a problem
that the board has been trying unsuccessfully to head off for the past
four years.
The Baldovie incinerator is the only municipal one in Scotland,
licensed to deal with clinical waste, of which Glasgow produces 14 tons
a day.
Every day from October, the yellow-bag waste, which includes human
tissue, used dressings, hypodermic needles, radioactive isotopes, and
drugs, will be uplifted and driven across Scotland in sealed containers
to Dundee.
An attempt by a commercial firm to build an incinerator in Yoker,
Glasgow, with the health board as a principal client, ended when
planning permission was refused after a campaign by residents in the
area.
Lack of open space has made it impossible to build a conventional
incinerator within the city to meet the board's needs. Other boards with
larger landward areas have found it easier -- Ayrshire and Arran has an
incinerator at Crosshouse Hospital, near Kilmarnock, which is modern and
conforms to current requirements, and also accommodates Argyll and
Clyde's clinical waste.
Lanarkshire has an incinerator at Hartwoodhill Hospital, currently
undergoing commissioning. Lothian, Tayside, and Grampian are also
accommodated at Baldovie.
However, hospital managers are concerned that protracted negotiations
between the board and Glasgow District Council have come to nothing
after four years. They are also disturbed by the cost of the deal, which
could be as high as #700,000 a year and ties them for 10 years.
The board also could face legal opposition to the move from a company
called Bio-Sure, which is marketing a steam-sterilisation process. It
believes the contract would be in contravention of European guidelines
that the waste should be disposed of as close to the source as possible.
Bio-Sure director Mr Stuart Byron -- former chief executive of Ross
Hall Hospital -- said last night that it could be cheaper for the board
to contract to have a new technique provided locally than transport it
to Dundee.
An interdict to halt the contract was one option being considered,
although it would not seek to stop waste actually being sent to Dundee
after the deadline has run out.
The battle for the lucrative clinical waste disposal market is a
complex one. Various technologies are competing -- some have been
canvassed by the health board and rejected. Board sources yesterday
dismissed claims being made last week by a Clydebank company that it was
ready to sign up for a microwave destruction plant.
''There are several techniques which can prepare the waste to make it
fit for landfill dumping, on the premise that incineration is like using
a sledgehammer to crack a nut,'' said Mr Colin Clark, a lecturer in
civil engineering at Strathclyde University and expert on waste
disposal.
''Microwaving involves chopping up the waste and passing it through an
augur -- a hollow Archimedes screw. It is subjected to microwaves which
heat it up until it comes out the other end disinfected.''
In another version, Continuous Feed Augur, hot oil pumped along the
inside of the screw boils the waste to 100 degrees Celsius or more.
Gasification -- which Glasgow District Council was offering to the
Health Board at one time -- simply involves loading the waste into a
furnace and heating it with extremely hot air, rather than flames.
''It is starved of oxygen and when it reaches a certain temperature it
degrades, leaving a small amount of residue.''
Other methods include liquid disinfection, where the waste is soaked
in chlorine dioxide, passed through the Archimedes screw and pressed in
order to get the liquid out of it; and radio waves, which are emitted in
an oven to heat the waste up to disinfection levels.
Trusts from Tayside Health Board are expected to abandon Baldovie in
favour of a new plant being opened in mid-September by ScotSafe in
Arbroath.
A consortium of nine trusts from Tayside, Highland, Grampian, and part
of Forth Valley will send 5000 tons a year to go through the Continuous
Feed Augur system. A ScotSafe spokesman said the process reduced the
waste by 70% in volume and 30% in mass. What came out the other end
resembled the contents of a Jiffy bag and was ''as clean as a
freshly-washed salad.''

THE body of a elderly man has been discovered in a boarded-up Glasgow
tenement flat where it lay unnoticed for several weeks.
Neighbours have demanded to know why housing officials failed to
realise anything was wrong and boarded up the flat a month ago.
Pensioner William Smith, 74, a single man who had lived in Winning
Row, Shettleston, for over 20 years, was reported missing by his sister,
Mrs Margaret Blake, of Haghill, three days ago after she had not seen
him for three months.
Police broke into the Scottish Homes-owned flat yesterday and found Mr
Smith's decomposing body. A police spokesman said it appeared that he
had been dead for several weeks, possibly months.
Neighbours Mary and Albert Horton, who moved into the top floor of the
tenement in March, said they had reported a burst pipe in the flat a
month ago.
Mr Horton said he had only seen Mr Smith on a couple of occasions but
had been concerned about his well-being.
''We heard rushing water and went down to the Scottish Homes office. A
plumber came and got into the flat through a broken window, then the
flat was boarded up at the back. ''Some kids put a brick through a
window and the rest of the house was boarded up. The police came and
looked through the letter box. I didn't know the old boy was in there.''
Mrs Horton said she had felt something was wrong. ''Call it women's
intuition but I was worried about the old man. It's a terrible thing
that has happened.''
Another neighbour, Mr James Jeffrey, said he had assumed Mr Smith had
been taken to hospital when the house was boarded up.
He said he had lived in the close next to the dead man's for 21 years
but said Mr Smith kept himself to himself.
''You usually saw him out at night going to the bakers to get pies.
No-one bothered because you don't think anyone's there if they boarded
the house up.
''A social worker came round here a week ago and knocked on the
door.''
Mr Michael Devlin, housing manager of Scottish Homes Gallowgate
office, confirmed a housing officer had called at the flat on August 14
but had no authority to force access.
''On August 16 an abandoned house report was drawn up but the
procedure is to wait 28 days before another report is filed and we can
legitimately gain access to the house.''
Mr Devlin said Mr Smith was not the sort to have left a broken window
or a burst pipe unattended and was a frequent visitor to the Scottish
Homes office.
''He came in here a lot to speak to people and got to know the
receptionist very well. When he went out he would walk up and down the
Gallowgate. He was very well known in the Parkhead area.''
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Regional Council social work department
said it would investigate reports that a social worker had recently
visited Mr Smith.
Last night police informed Mrs Blake of her brother's death.
A spokesman for Scottish Homes said last night: ''We have launched a
full and detailed inquiry into the circumstances of this incident.
''Until our investigations have been completed and the full facts are
known, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further, other than
to express our obvious concern.''

<TEXT>
ONE of the first offenders to be tagged under new trials of an
electronic monitoring system has been arrested again, it was learned
yesterday.
The 29-year-old man, from Norfolk, was detained yesterday following a
theft allegation. He was not charged but given police bail until next
Thursday.
The man wore a court-imposed tag on his wrist, designed to trigger an
alarm and warn the private monitoring company if the offender ventured
out of his house during the curfew hours.
A Home Office spokesman said he could not comment on a particular case
but emphasised that the tagging technology was designed to monitor
curfew conditions. It did not compel an offender to respect such
conditions, he said.
The National Association of Probation Officers said the monitoring
equipment was working but it was concerned that the demands of the tag
on offenders were unrealistic.
''It is highly unlikely that offenders with chaotic lifestyles will be
able to adjust to the conditions of house arrest,'' assistant general
secretary Harry Fletcher said.''For many, the tag sets them up to
fail.''
It is thought that only four orders have been made in two of the three
pilot areas, Norfolk and Manchester, since the courts there were given
the power to impose tagging orders at the beginning of July.
No orders have been made in the third pilot area, Reading.
The nine-month trial is expected to cost #1.4m.
Tagging was used previously on defendants on bail in London,
Nottingham, and North Tyneside in 1989 before being abandoned because of
technical problems and cost.

Labour accused the Government of ignoring the growing plight of young
people out of work.
Figures released yesterday by Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet
Harman showed 216,000 young people under the age of 25 had never had a
job or a place on a training scheme.
Seasonally-adjusted figures for last month put the number of young
people who are unemployed at 647,100 -- a rise of 32,000 since April.
The unemployment rate among the under 25s currently stands at 15.5% --
almost double the rate for the overall workforce of 8.3%.
According to Labour's figures, youth unemployment rose between April
and July in every region apart from East Anglia, where the total
remained static.
At a Westminster news conference, Ms Harman described the figures as
''scandalous'' and said they represented the emergence of an alarming
trend which the Government ignored at its peril.
''This is not a statistical blip,'' she said. ''Many young people are
in danger of being alienated from the rest of a society which appears to
offer them little or no future.''
She said Labour would be presenting its own package of measures for
tackling the problem at the party's conference in October.
New proposals currently under consideration include raising the VAT
threshold for small businesses if they take on a young unemployed person
and lifting the 16-hour rule which prevents people claiming unemployment
benefit if they are studying for more than 16 hours a week.
The party is also further developing its plans for an environmental
task force, unveiled last year by Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown.
Other measures in the package include a #75-a-week tax rebate for
employers who take people who have been out of work for two years or
more.

<HEADLINE>Grief of wife's death shattered bank manager</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A COURT heard yesterday of the ''tragedy'' of a bank manager who
became a tramp and an alcoholic because of grief over his wife's death.
Dingwall Sheriff Court was told former TSB manager Alastair Chisholm,
62, has been ''on the road'' for the past three years.
As Chisholm sat gaunt, unshaven, and tieless in the dock, dressed in
grubby and crumpled sports jacket and trousers, fiscal David Hingston
told Sheriff James Fraser: ''This is a tragedy you see sitting before
you.
''It is distressing that a man of his background finds himself in this
position.''
Chisholm, of no fixed abode, admitted that on the previous day he
caused two breaches of the peace in nearby Muir of Ord by frightening
girls aged eight and nine as they walked home separately from school
through a park at lunchtime and later in the afternoon.
He was lying asleep in the grass with his tweed cap over his eyes when
he was wakened by the passing girls. The former bank manager got to his
feet and walked towards them. They ran off.
Added the fiscal: ''I can't see what the interest was. He has only one
previous conviction and no history of interfering with children. He had
not been hanging about the school.
''I think it was just a case of a chronic alcoholic being disturbed
out of his sleep.''
Defence lawyer Roger Webb said Chisholm, who received a pension of
#470 a month, delivered to his brothers' home in Smith Avenue,
Inverness, had changed when his wife died 15 years ago. He retired in
1975.
He added: ''He has been on the road for the past three years, living
rough.''
Sheriff Fraser fined him #100 and no time to pay. With no money on his
person, Chisholm was taken off to the police cells, then to Porterfield
Prison in Inverness to face the option of seven days behind bars. His
brother is presently on holiday in Norway.

IT'S official. Whisky drinking is no longer the remit of old bearded
men in torn woolly jumpers but a sure sign of a younger modern man keen
to commit. The television premiere tonight of an advertisement for
Bell's whisky breaks broadcasting history as well as shattering
entrenched stereotypes.
Viewers across Scotland and the north of England will watch a man in
his late twenties explain to his friends in a chic modern pub that he
will still be there for them. Just a little more distant, now that he
has found true love, though not with the bottle.
The #2m campaign for Bell's eight- year-old blend, run by United
Distillers, does push the idea that the most famous Scottish spirit is a
cool drink for a late twenty and thirty-something crowd. However, it
does not desert their more regular clientele.
To illustrate the idea of their drink as a product of refinement and
quality, the advert will show the different stages of whisky distilling,
cut between a young man's decision to commit to his sweetheart.
This contrast between the ''craft'' and the ''crack'' will be the
focus of a campaign which begins with a 60-second advert tonight, then
uses a 40-second advert 25 times over the next two weeks.
Those who receive Border Television will be the first people in
Britain to see an actual whisky advert on television. The advert will be
broadcast for the first time at 8.15pm during an episode of The Bill.
Though never banned by law, liquor companies entered into a voluntary
agreement not to advertise. However, pressure has been exerted over the
past couple of years to end the ''gentleman's agreement''.
Alcohol Concern remains worried that the adverts will encourage young
people to drink spirits at an earlier age.
A spokesperson for Bell's whisky said: ''We think people will be
surprised at the end of the advert when they discover that it is
actually advertising whisky.
''It's really quite subtle. The two strands are saying to younger
people, not young people -- as it is the 25 to 30 age group we are
looking towards -- to think again about whisky. It is relevant and it is
a quality product.''
Scottish viewers of Channel Four will see the advert at 9.15pm during
Ellen while viewers of STV can view it during Shogun at 9.20pm.

WEATHERMEN may be among the more prescient members of society but they
were taking no wagers yesterday on how many records had been broken by
the month of August. Driest, sunniest, and warmest were just three of
the bets being laid by those of us who favour a wager.
''It's too close to call at the moment,'' said a spokesman at London
Weather Centre, where forecasters were waiting for the last spot of
drizzle, the final burst of sunshine and for dusk to settle.
''We are waiting for the last figures to come in and even then it will
take some time to be sure,'' said the spokesman.
''There will probably be little more than a decimal point here and
there. There will be some individual records broken but it is very
difficult to predict.''
Britain was heading towards its driest August on record until the past
week, when light showers passed through most parts of the country.
Even so, experts say only 25% of the average rainfall for the month
fell on England and Wales. Some places had only 10%.
In Scotland, Glasgow experienced only 21% of the average rainfall for
the month while for Aberdeen and Lerwick it was one of the driest on
record.
There is no doubt that Britain had one of its best Augusts and it was
as good as the scorching summers of 1947 and 1976.
The hottest day was on August 1, when 94F was recorded at Heathrow
Airport. Temperatures in the month were in the 80s and 90s until the
final week.
Glasgow got close to its highest temperature -- 88F recorded in August
1975 -- when August 11 hit 86F. Aberdeen, however, made it into the
record books again when it hit 86F on August 21, while Kirkwall had its
hottest day yet for August with 76F on the 25th.
London had its sunniest month on record with 287 hours of sunshine
compared with 273 in 1989. Parts of the West Country, West Midlands, and
southern England are expected to equal or surpass this figure.
Glasgow will not be able to beat its August 1947 record when no rain
fell on the city. Scotland and Northern Ireland were also wetter than in
1947.
A Glasgow Weather Centre spokeswoman said the city had, however,
smashed its sunshine record for the summer with 730 hours compared with
the previous best of 643 in 1977.
Meanwhile, the spokeswoman said that September looked like starting
off on an unsettled note. However, she added that she was hopeful that
September, which is traditionally a good month in Scotland, would not
disappoint people.
Bookmakers, you have been warned.

<HEADLINE>Workers' guarded welcome for Mitsui. Japanese in #56m move for Babcock</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROY ROGERS, INDUSTRIAL CORRESPONDENT,WILLIAM TINNING</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

PLANS by Babcock International to sell a 75% controlling stake in its
energy division to Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Company of Japan,
will have no adverse effect on the 3000 UK employees involved, including
some 929 in Renfrew and Dumbarton, it was claimed yesterday.
Executives of both companies took pains to stress that the #56m deal
would strengthen the prospects of the division, which will trade under
the new name of Mitsui Babcock Energy Ltd, thereby making existing jobs
more secure.
The news was greeted with ''guarded optimism'' by many of the workers
at Babcock's three operations in Renfrew and Dumbarton.
The partial withdrawal from its traditional base in power station
boiler, steam generator, and nuclear component manufacture comes at a
time when Babcock's boiler orders are at their highest for some years.
The takeover could become total as there is an option to sell the
remaining 25% shareholding to Mitsui (MES) within the next five years
for a further #12.5m.
Babcock chairman Dr John Parker welcomed the agreement as an important
development for both partners. As a result, Babcock's former energy
division would now be in a stronger financial position, enabling it to
better exploit its potential in world power generation markets.
This, he said, should be to the benefit of employees, customers, and
UK exports, as well as allowing Babcock to concentrate more actively on
its other key businesses. These include Rosyth Dockyard, which it
already manages and is currently bidding for, and several former BR
workshops, including Springburn, in Glasgow.
MES president Jiro Hoshino said that by combining the expertise of
both companies, advantage could be taken of opportunities in the global
market place, allowing MBE to ''grow the business''.
He declared himself very impressed with the strength of Babcock
technology and the commitment of its people.
MBE will continue to be headquartered in the UK under the chairmanship
of MES main board director Ken Saeki. The existing management team, led
by chief executive Duncan Fox, who operates from the Crawley, Sussex
site, is to remain in place, and Babcock group chief executive Nick
Salmon will remain on the board of MBE in a non-executive capacity.
Tokyo-based MES is a major international engineering and shipbuilding
group with a market capitalisation and network approximately five times
that of Babcock, which is itself a multinational with companies in 25
countries, contracts in 40, and about 11,500 employees.
The 929 employees at Renfrew and Dumbarton are perceived by many
people to be the rearguard of the Babcock operation, which once boasted
a local workforce of about 9000.
Paisley North Labour MP Irene Adams expressed hope that the move would
not spell ''another false dawn'' for the workforce who, she said, had
worked under the ''shadow of unemployment'' for too long.
CBI Scotland director Lex Gold said it was inevitable that
''alliances'' such as the one between Babcock and Mitsui would become
more common in an increasingly competitive global market place.
Mr Howard Jordan, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, said he was
''disappointed'' that control of a Scottish-based company had gone out
of the country.
Mr Cox assured The Herald that the company's manufacturing plant and
technology centre in Renfrew, and its tube plant at Dumbarton, which
between them employ 929, would continue to play ''a very important
role'' under the new regime.
Two of four Chinese boiler contracts signed in June, worth about
#125m, should guarantee work for at least two years at Renfrew.
Mr Graham McMillan, acting staff convener at the Renfrew manufacturing
plant, said the mood among the workers was ''more optimistic'' than it
had been for a while.
One worker, who declined to be named, said: ''The mood among staff is
one of guarded optimism. The problem with our business is that it is
very capital intensified and companies such as Babcock need financial
muscle to compete on the global market. It would appear we now have that
with Mitsui's intervention.
''While we have been through bad times and suffered more cutbacks than
we care to remember, this increases the optimism for the future.''
Another worker, on a more pessimistic note, said: ''Management are
telling us that Mitsui's involvement is great for the company but the
reality is that Babcock is finished.''

ELIZABETH Taylor revealed yesterday that her marriage to her seventh
husband, former construction worker Larry Fortensky, is in trouble.
They met in the Betty Ford Clinic in California in 1988 where they
were both being treated for alcohol problems.
In a statement they said: ''We both need our space for a while so we
have agreed to a trial separation. We both hope this is only
temporary.''
Perfume company Elizabeth Arden cancelled the launch of her latest
fragrance Black Pearls but she says it will be coming out next year.
The 63-year-old actress is 20 years older than Fortensky.
Hollywood's veteran Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd said:
''Though they call it a trial separation, he has moved out.''
British film director Michael Winner said: ''As someone who has been
in love with Elizabeth Taylor for more than 40 years, I am very sad.''
Taylor had achieved stardom and fame but not happiness. ''When the
glitter and glamour is over you go home to a house and then it is you
and the person you are with that matters.''
Richard Burton's sister-in-law Betty added: ''It doesn't surprise us
at all. I didn't think it would last. I don't think any of us did.''
Fortensky was constantly at her side when she fought a life-and-death
battle against viral pneumonia in April 1990. They married in October
1991 at Michael Jackson's Neverland estate in California.
Critics described the marriage as ''beauty and the beast'' but Taylor
said: ''This time, with God's blessing, it's for keeps. He is the least
greedy man I have ever met.
Taylor's love life has always been tempestuous and sparked as many
headlines as her acting career.
Her husbands were hotel heir Conrad 'Nicky' Hilton, British actor
Michael Wilding, film producer Mike Todd, who died in a plane crash,
singer Eddie Fisher, actor Richard Burton, whom she married twice, and
then US politician John Warner.
London born of American parents, she began her career in Los Angeles
aged nine as a child actress in the film There's One Born Every Minute,
and achieved fame as the star of National Velvet.
She won Oscars for Butterfield 8 and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf
but in recent years has concentrated on Aids charity work.
She has been dogged by ill-health for many years with back problems,
weight problems, and drink and drug problems. She has undergone two hip
replacement operations.
Taylor is estimated to have a personal fortune of more than #100m, and
one of the most fabulous collections of jewellery outside a royal
family.
The couple reportedly signed a pre-nuptial deal limiting his share of
the money to #2m should the marriage fail. Her four children pressed for
the agreement, according to reports
Her greatest love was Burton, who lavished her with diamonds, furs,
homes, and the yacht Kalizma, worth millions of pounds.
They met when they appeared in the film epic Cleopatra in 1962. Two
years later, she divorced her fourth husband Eddie Fisher and within 10
days had married Burton.
They were great stars, great lovers and, of most concern to the
film-makers, great earners, pulling down an estimated $100m.
Burton indulged his wife's love of diamonds and spent fortunes on
rings, necklaces and other jewellery. The most famous items were the
69-carat Idol's Eye diamond, made into a ring, and a #370,000 diamond
and ruby necklace once owned by Shah Jehan, builder of the Taj Mahal.
Their marriage lasted for 10 years, the longest of her marriages, but
in June 1974 they found life together impossible and divorced.
As well as the weddings, Miss Taylor has been engaged at least twice,
turned down an offer of marriage from the late billionaire publisher
Malcolm Forbes, and enjoyed a close friendship with actor George
Hamilton.

<TEXT>
A WOMAN who killed her baby by swinging him by his feet into the
stairs was allowed to walk free from the Old Bailey yesterday.
Suzanne Oatley was suffering from post-natal depression when she
killed 11-day-old Alexander in what Judge Gerald Gordon called a tragic
case. He imposed a two-year probation order on condition that
37-year-old Oatley receives medical treatment.
Oatley, of Hinchley Wood, Surrey, had admitted infanticide. The
secretary and linguist, who has worked in South America and the Middle
East, was unable to cope when her son was born.
''Perhaps we should have him adopted. I wish it was just the two of us
again,'' she told medical staff, referring to her lover, Mr Alan Lewis,
40, with whom she was besotted, said Mr Richard Horwell, prosecuting.
During her unplanned pregnancy, Oatley had sought an abortion, telling
doctors Mr Lewis did not want the baby. However, she later changed her
mind and told her GP he was being very supportive.
In fact, said Mr Andrew Trollop, defending, Mr Lewis had been
supportive throughout the pregnancy.
The international quantity surveyor had flown back from Nigeria, where
he was working, for Alexander's birth and because of Oatley's behaviour
took over the day-to-day care of the baby, to whom he was devoted.
Just 11 days after the birth, Mr Lewis went out for a quick drink
after caring for the baby all day. When he returned, he found Oatley and
the baby lying at the bottom of the steps. The baby died soon afterwards
in hospital from severe head injuries.
Mr Trollop said Mr Lewis and her parents stood by her. She now hoped
to start again with Mr Lewis.

<TEXT>
THE headmaster of one of Britain's best-known public schools has
resigned, its governors said last night.
Mr Peter Hobson, head of Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey, left
because of ''personal reasons and ill-health'', according to chairman of
the governors Sir Anthony Laughton.
''I cannot add to the reasons that have been given for his
resignation,'' he said.
''The reasons we have given for his resignation are a matter of
confidence between him and the governing body.''
He said the circumstances that led to Mr Hobson's resignation were not
being investigated by police, adding: ''Why should they be involved in a
matter of health and personal reasons?''
Mr Hobson resigned as head of the #12,000-a-year school just days
before the new term starts next week. The first parents knew was a
letter received on Wednesday from the school's governors.
In it, Sir Anthony said his resignation had been accepted ''with
sadness''. Mr Hobson had served the school well during his two years as
headmaster, taking many new initiatives.
''It is a matter of great regret that he will not be at the school to
see them mature,'' it said.
The headship had been taken over by the school's second master Clive
Carter, and the governors' letter said they had ''total confidence that
the school's high standards will be maintained during the forthcoming
year under his leadership''.
Mr Hobson's departure came as another leading public school, Dulwich
College, south London, faced up to the suspension of its headmaster.
Mr Anthony Verity is understood to have been accused of sexual
harassment by a secretary at the school.
Mr Hobson, 50, who is married, arrived at Charterhouse -- founded in
1611 and one of the country's most expensive boarding schools -- two
years ago, after spending seven years as head at Giggleswick School,
North Yorkshire.

A MAJOR Scottish dairy company has threatened to relocate a Midlothian
depot employing 85 people if it fails to get local authority support for
a planning application for a car park.
The application has annoyed district councillor George Purcell, who
said yesterday he did not believe the business of East Kilbride-based
Robert Wiseman Dairies would be jeopardised if the application, which is
contrary to two local plans, was rejected.
''I am not too happy about the tone of the letter,'' said Mr Purcell,
who represents the ward at Loanhead where the company runs an operation
at Edgefield industrial estate.
In a letter to this week's planning committee, agents for the company,
seeking a change of use of agricultural land to parking space, said:''If
Wisemans do not obtain planning permission in respect for this strip of
land, then they will have no alternative than to relocate from Loanhead
where they rely on the local workforce.''
On Wednesday, the committee agreed by seven votes to four to grant
consent to the application which is being opposed by a number of
householders who claim the extension would increase noise and pollution
from lorries.
Planning officers recommended the application be refused as contrary
to the adopted Local Plan for the area and to the approved Lothian
Region Structure Plan. Mr Purcell said he fully supported this.
In the agents' letter, the company said it had suffered severe space
restrictions at the depot.
It emphasised it would include landscaping and screening measures and
maintained the industrial estate was well established before
construction of houses in nearby Mayshade Road.
Managing director Robert Wiseman said in a letter the company could
not allow the current situation to continue.
''Over the years, we have been a significant employer at Loanhead and
if we had no option but to relocate our operations, then this would have
a significant effect on the future of our workforce.''
In July, Robert Wiseman Dairies, which the previous month had bought
the Scottish milk distribution business of the Co-operative Wholesale
Society for #6.6m, announced it was to close a CWS dairy employing
around 70 workers in Titwood Road, Glasgow.
At the time, Mr Wiseman said the creamery did not meet the high
standards customers demanded and he also claimed the dairy had been the
subject of repeated complaints from residents over noise and traffic
movements.
The Loanhead planning application will now go to a joint planning
liaison committee representing Lothian local authorities and is expected
to be debated later by the full council. It may be called in by the
Scottish Secretary.

THE #1000m hostile bid by Glasgow-based ScottishPower for English
regional electricity company Manweb is to be allowed to go ahead.
Trade Secretary Ian Lang yesterday unexpectedly declined to refer the
bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the advice of the Office
of Fair Trading.
It is a decision which will be seen as seriously undermining the
position of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the controversial electricity
regulator who had argued for a referral.
The Trade Secretary also waived through, again on the advice of the
OFT, the two other electricity mergers where terms have been agreed,
Hanson's #2500m offer for Eastern Group and the #1100m bid from Southern
Electric International of the US for South Western Electricity.
In the stock market shares of the regional electricity companies
immediately soared in the expectation of a free-for-all in the sector as
predators move in, especially from the US where several power giants are
believed to be eyeing up the utilities.
Manweb itself rocketed 93p to 971p. This compares with a bid value of
around 980p in cash and shares but is well above the all-cash terms of
915p.
There had been strong speculation that the ScottishPower bid, the
first by a power generator for a distributor, was in particular likely
to be put before the MMC.
Professor Littlechild said it should be referred because it would
reduce the number of companies he compares to monitor competitiveness.
Mr Lang accepted that it raised different issues to the other two
takeovers. But he said the industry regulator can make licence changes
to satisfy concerns raised by vertical integration, which would result
from Scottish Power owning Manweb.
He had accepted assurances from ScottishPower to agree to appropriate
licence amendments.
Undertakings signed by ScottishPower included agreeing not to sign
contracts to supply Manweb with electricity, to make clear to customers
which company they were dealing with, and to ensure that Manweb sold its
stake in the National Grid when it is floated.
The Trade Seretary's decision was welcomed by all the electricity
companies including Manweb, whose finance director, Mr Stuart Siddall,
said the company was never relying on a referral and pointed to the
movement in its share price as justification that the ScottishPower
terms undervalued the company.
But the electricity go-ahead brought a storm of protest in some
political and trade union circles. Labour's industry spokesman, Mr Brian
Wilson, said it was another slap in the face for power customers who are
the captive market for these monopolies.
''By doing nothing Mr Lang has given the green light for a takeover
free-for-all without regard for protecting consumer interests,'' he
said.
The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union's acting general
secretary, Mr Ken Jackson, said: ''This decision is sure to plunge the
industry into a further period of chaos and uncertainty as rumours
abound about further takeovers and mergers.''

THE Most Rev Desmond Tutu, Archbishop of South Africa, spoke yesterday
of his deep distress over the situation between Bosnians and Serbs --
but said lessons could be learned by looking at events in his own
country.
The archbishop was speaking in St Andrews, where he is leading a
Scottish Episcopal Church conference which is discussing the way forward
for the church in the twenty-first century.
''No-one who saw the Sarajevo marketplace scenes could have failed to
be moved and filled with revulsion.
''One just longs so desperately that people would realise that the
things that unite us are actually a great deal better than the things
that separate us,'' he said.
He gave said South Africa could be praised for saying: ''Look here,
there are people of different races, of different cultures, of different
religions, and affiliations, who are coming together, seeking to be one
nation, when everything has conspired to separate them.
''That kind of nightmare they have had has ended, and this one will
also end if we are looking for the things that unite us.''
The archbishop said he was full of deep anguish and agony looking at
television pictures of the elderly, and of children looking so
bewildered.
That, he said, showed the tremendous depths to which people could sink
while there were still ''wonderful things'' of which humanity was
capable, and the world had to be constantly reminded.
He said that out of such a cauldron of suffering, if the leaders could
get their act together, it would be possible for something new to
emerge.
Earlier, speaking alongside the Swilcan Bridge at the eighteenth hole
at St Andrews, Archbishop Tutu said he was delighted to visit
Scotland,''a lovely country'' for the conference, and to thank the
Scottish people for their support in the struggle against apartheid.
Prayer support from Scotland, he insisted, had helped his countrymen,
coupled with vociferous support from young Scots, in particular, in the
anti-apartheid movement, along with the boycott of South African goods.
The archbishop concluded his visit by confessing that he had been a
golf caddie as a boy -- in ebullient style admitting that he was good at
most sports . . . from the comfort of his sofa.

One man died and another was taken to hospital last night after their
boat capsized on rocks at Boyne Bay, near Banff. Lorry driver Alexander
Johnston, 59, of Main Street, Portsoy, was dead on arrival at hospital
in Elgin. Mr John Bromham, 65, of Reading, was detained overnight for
observation in a Banff hospital. The two men had been on a fishing trip.
Mr Bromham swam ashore and raised the alarm. Mr Johnston was winched
onto a rescue helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth.

A DIVER was found alive yesterday 10 hours after he went missing in
Loch Long.
Mr Cameron Bell, 32, managed to crawl ashore and was found by a
passing cyclist while police divers were still searching the waters
where he had gone missing earlier.
Rescuers said he must have spent most of the time in the water and had
done very well to survive. Diving experts called it ''a miracle''.
Semi-conscious after his long ordeal, Mr Bell was taken by ambulance
under police escort to a decompression chamber at the Royal Navy's
submarine base at nearby Faslane.
Last night, a spokesman at the base said Mr Bell's condition was
''much improved''.
Mr Bell, a professional diver who runs a sports company in East
Kilbride, had been taking part in a late-night dive with three friends
off the loch's Ardgarten Point when he went missing about 1.30am.
His companions saw his torch go out. They then saw it come back on
again but when they went to investigate it was shining on the bed of the
loch with no sign of Mr Bell.
Helensburgh inshore lifeboat, coastguard auxiliaries, and Ministry of
Defence police launches began a search and a helicopter was scrambled
from the Royal Navy's HMS Gannet base at Prestwick. They were joined
later by a police underwater team.
As the hours passed, the rescue services began to fear the worst but,
at 11.30am, Mr Bell was discovered on the verge of a lochside road two
miles south of Arrochar by holidaymaker John O'Connor.
Mr O'Connor, 48, a PE teacher from Morpeth in Northumberland, said:
''I saw him lying on the verge, face down, with his hands out and a
knife in one hand, and I turned him on to his side.
''I said a prayer, hoping he wasn't dead, but I really thought he was
at first. His breathing was quite good but his pulse rate was quite slow
and his extremities were very cold.''
Last night, one of Scotland's most experienced divers told how easy it
was to become disoriented while under water. Mr George Mackie added that
diving in deep water could quickly affect your responses, making them
much slower.
''I don't know much about this incident at Loch Long but it looks to
me like a classic case of someone getting into difficulties and then
becoming more and more disorientated. It sounds like a miracle that he
managed to get ashore and survived.''
Mr Bell and his companions had planned to dive in an area where the
water was 18 metres deep. However, the spot beside the loch where he was
found was close to a trench 50 metres deep.
If he accidentally exceeded the depth he had intended to dive at, he
was likely to have suffered an ''O2 Bend'' attack, caused by oxygen
poisoning, which would have led to disorientation and intense pain.
Last night, one of the other divers in the group, Mr George Lees, 36,
of Marywood Square, Glasgow, said: ''It was an unfortunate incident.
These things happen very infrequently. I have not seen Gordon but I have
been told by the medical staff at Faslane that he is better. I am very
tired and, of course, very relieved it's all over.''
Other members of the diving party were Mr Brian Fallon, 34, of
Tanzieknowe Avenue, Cambuslang, Glasgow, and Andrea Russell, 29, a
female police constable with Strathclyde Police.

NATO warplanes pressed on with fresh raids on Bosnian Serb targets
yesterday but a senior US envoy said serious peace negotiations were now
under way thanks to an ''immensely important'' breakthrough.
As the warplanes struck yesterday, Bosnian Serb television showed
pictures of five EU monitors alive and in Serb hands. All five were
believed to have been killed on Wednesday. A senior Bosnian Serb
official said later they had been released.
On the diplomatic front, US special envoy Richard Holbrooke said
agreement by the Bosnian Serbs that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
could speak for them had paved the way for the first substantive peace
talks in 16 months.
Twice during the day yesterday, RAF Harrier jump jets and Jaguar
strike aircraft took off fully ''bombed-up'' from their base at Gioia
del Colle in southern Italy, but had to return because of low cloud.
A senior military source said last night: ''There are likely to be
real fireworks tomorrow if the Bosnian Serbs do not pull back, and that
looks unlikely.''
General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army commander, was understood
to have ordered troops to hide equipment in populated areas.
However, the military source added: ''There are still plenty of
targets and large-scale attacks are expected.''
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, in a letter to UN special envoy
Yasushi Akashi, said there was no need for air strikes as Bosnian Serbs
had no wish to target safe areas.
US military officials said reports suggested the air strikes had
halted Bosnian Serb shelling of Sarajevo but there were no indications
heavy weapons were being pulled back.
At Nato southern command headquarters in Naples US Navy Captain Jim
Mitchell said: ''These operations include air strikes, air cover,
reconnaissance, and of course search and rescue operations are
continuing for the two French pilots.''
The pilots ejected from their Mirage 2000 fighter-bomber when it was
shot down by a Bosnian Serb missile on Wednesday. French authorities
said they are known to be safe.
Bosnian Serb radio said yesterday's Nato attacks hit two sites
north-east of Sarajevo. It claimed several civilians were killed in the
raids ''in an area where there were neither military nor industrial
facilities''.
TV staff said the pictures of the five EU monitors with Bosnian Serb
officials were taken yesterday.
The information minister of the self-styled Bosnian Serb ''republic'',
Miroslav Toholj, said the men and their translator and driver had later
been set free and had already left Serb-held Bosnia. He did not say
where they had gone.
The missing EU men are three Spaniards led by the Spanish head of the
EU observation mission in the former Yugoslavia, an Irishman and a
Dutchman.
President Bill Clinton yesterday called for a negotiated end to the
war in Bosnia and said the Nato military campaign was sending a clear
message to Bosnian Serbs that the killing of innocent civilians must
end.
''The war in Bosnia must end, but not on the battlefield, rather at
the negotiating table,'' Clinton said in a brief speech at Hickam Air
Force Base after arriving in Honolulu.
Nato said it would not call off the biggest operation in its history
until the siege of Sarajevo was lifted.
A senior US officer at Nato headquarters in Naples said Operation
Deliberate Force would go on ''24 hours a day until we are told
otherwise''.
Setting out its terms for halting the raids a senior Nato official
said: ''We are not talking about the noose being loosened, the noose
must be taken away, not just loosened around the victim's neck.''
He said Nato and UN commanders demanded the removal of all heavy
weapons around the Bosnian capital, the reopening of the airport,
guaranteed access to routes in and out of the city and the restoration
of electricity and other utilities.
New Serb promises to remove heavy weapons threatening Sarajevo and
other safe areas such as Tuzla and Gorazde would not be good enough this
time. ''Safe areas must become exactly that -- safe,'' he said.
German Tornado jets were called upon yesterday to fly their country's
first potential combat mission since the Second World War but they had
to return to their base at the Italian town of Piacenza due to an
unspecified technical hitch.
American special envoy Richard Holbrooke, speaking in Belgrade, said
serious negotiations were finally under way thanks to an ''immensely
important'' procedural breakthrough engineered by Milosevic.
Holbrooke said that until Wednesday night, there was no-one from the
Bosnian Serb side who could talk for them and who accepted a plan drawn
up by the Big Power Contact group as a starting point for negotiations.
Milosevic announced on Wednesday the Bosnian Serbs had agreed to give
him a veto over terms of a peace deal that would now be negotiated by a
six-man team, three of whom would be from the breakaway Serb
''republic'' inside Bosnia.
Holbrooke said both the Bosnian Serbs and government side now agreed
to the 51:49% split of Bosnia.
''But they have very, very different ideas of which side gets what
parts of the country and this is going to be a very tough negotiation
but finally, as of last night, it's under way,'' he said.

THE British and Irish Prime Ministers will seek to give fresh impetus
to the faltering Northern Ireland peace process at a Chequers summit
next Wednesday after Sinn Fein leaders declared yesterday, on the first
anniversary of the process, that it was ''in crisis''.
The two Governments announced that the summit between Mr John Major
and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton will go ahead despite earlier fears
that it might have to be delayed because of lack of agreement on the
next step.
Several telephone calls between the Prime Ministers earlier this week
appear to have overcome this hurdle. It now looks as though the two men
will call for an international commission to oversee the decommissioning
of weapons in the province.
Leading Sinn Fein negotiator Martin McGuinness, speaking at a news
conference at Westminster, ruled out the IRA handing over a single gun
as a gesture to break the talks deadlock.
He said they would regard that as ''an act of surrender''.
Mr McGuinness said: ''There is no way under, over or around this
issue. The British Government must abandon its attempts to get an IRA
surrender and demonstrate wisdom and courage in moving the peace process
beyond this stagnant stage.''
Both he and Mr Gerry Adams in Belfast said the process was now ''in
crisis''. However, the British and Irish Governments believe that an
international commission might be the way to start talks on
decommissioning.
The next obstacle to be overcome will be whether the British
Government gives the all- clear to talks between the Northern Ireland
political parties in parallel with talks on setting up a commission or
insists on its establishment before the talks can begin.
Even then, it is highly unlikely that the Unionist parties will agree
to sit down with Sinn Fein before IRA guns and bombs have been disposed
of under the eye of the commission.
British and Irish Government sources were cautiously optimistic
yesterday that ways would be found to inch the process forward.
However, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew accused Sinn
Fein and the IRA of inflexibility and said the republicans had to
''remove the shadow of the gun'' from the search for peace.
He said all the flexibility shown in the last year had been by the
British Government while IRA and Sinn Fein stuck to saying they had a
tradition of not giving up arms -- ''Not exactly new thinking is it?''
Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley denounced the idea of an
international commission as ''a sell-out''. He said: ''It is not
acceptable to the people of Northern Ireland that the IRA are to be
elevated on to the plane where they shall sit down at a table because
they have arms and dictate the policy that is going to govern Northern
Ireland.''
Ulster Unionist spokesman Ken McGuinness was more restrained. He told
BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme: ''The IRA keep on talking
about surrendering. Nobody else has talked about that. What we have
talked about is the transition from the terrorist mode to the democratic
mode''.
Some encouragement for the two Governments has come from the perhaps
unlikely source of Mrs Bernadette McAliskey, who as Bernadette Devlin
was a nationalist MP at Westminster in the 1970's.
She said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the war was over and
the IRA would be unable to activate its only threat of resuming violence
''because people love the peace''.
Both Prime Ministers will be hoping she is right.
* The anniversary was marked in Glasgow with the launch of a campaign
group demanding the release of all so-called political prisoners held in
Northern Irish prisons, writes Alison Daniels.
Last night, a former republican prisoner, Felim O'Hagan, who served 17
years of a life sentence in the Maze prison before being released in
May, joined the campaign group Saoirse holding a vigil in George Square.
The group, an offshoot of a republican-founded organisation in
Northern Ireland, called on Scots to add their voices to those across
the sectarian divide demanding the release of 700 men and women, both
loyalists and republicans, held in jails in Northern Ireland, Britain,
and the United States, whom it described as political prisoners.
* Candle-light vigils were held as thousands of Sinn Fein supporters
took to the streets across Northern Ireland to mark the midnight start
of the IRA ceasefire one year ago.
The largest rallies were in Belfast and Londonderry. In Belfast,
rallies were held outside Army and police bases while in Londonderry
several thousand people marched from the Fort George army base to Free
Derry Corner in the Bogside.
