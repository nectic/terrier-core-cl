NEALE Doughty, who rode Hallo Dandy to victory in the 1984 Grand
National, produced a fairy-tale ending to his career at Kelso yesterday
when he won his final race on American Hero at 15-2.
The 37-year-old jump jockey, who had announced earlier that he would
retire at the end of the Kelso meeting, was given a tremendous reception
by the crowd as he came back to the winner's enclosure.
First to congratulate him was his former guv'nor, Penrith trainer
Gordon Richards, who was responsible for Hallo Dandy.
Richards presented him with a silver horse trophy on behalf of the
Kelso executive to mark his retirement.
Doughty, who rode 598 winners, said in an emotional farewell speech:
''I've ridden a lot of lovely horses for a lot of lovely people.''
Richards described him as ''an exceptionally good jockey over fences''
and added: ''We had some good times together.''
The Welsh-born jockey, who started his career at Kelso in 1976, said
he had decided to bow out now because it was beginning to be
increasingly difficult to keep his weight under control, and the
''wasting'' was beginning to get to him.
He split with Gordon Richards last year after what has been described
as a long, successful, but stormy relationship.
Doughty partnered Pounentes, who won the Mackeson Gold Cup for Billy
McGhie of Lochmaben in 1983. He was also associated with Pat's Jester,
owned by Selkirk businessman Geoff Adam, who beat Katabatic in the
Newton Chase at Haydock and was second to The Fellow in the King George
in 1992.
Trainer Dick Allan said yesterday: ''He was very brave and gave 100%
when he rode Pat's Jester in the King George. He gave me the highlight
of my career.''
Tony Dobbin may miss his Grand National ride on General Pershing after
a bad fall on Astrac Trio in the Novices Handicap Chase, the second race
on yesterday's Kelso card. He suffered a rib injury and left the course
in considerable pain.
Doughty rode General Pershing in a gallop after racing.

SCOTLAND centre Gregor Townsend will undergo an arthro-scopic
examination to his injured left knee today but the feeling now is that
the damage to the ligament which has put him out of the World Cup might
not be as bad as at first feared, writes Derek Douglas.
Townsend, who came by the injury in his last club game of the season
against Hawick a fortnight ago, was seen by orthopaedic surgeon Richard
Nutton at the Princess Margaret Rose Hospital in Edinburgh yesterday. He
will be admitted to the hospital today where medical staff will conduct
an internal examination of the joint.
Yesterday Townsend said: ''I don't want to get my hopes up until I
have actually had the 'scope' but, at the moment, they don't think the
ligament is torn.''
If the posterior cruciate ligament is ripped then the player will have
to undergo an operation and he could be sidelined for a year. Andy
Nicol, the ex-Dundee HS FP scrum half, who is now with Bath, is just
returning to the game after a similar injury sustained last May.
Scotland scrum half Gary Armstrong, who is being treated by the same
surgeon at the PMR, suffered damage to the posterior cruciate ligament
to a knee last autumn, and is still working his way back to fitness. He
does not expect to be able to take contact on the damaged joint until
this September. Townsend, who was at the heart of the upturn in
Scotland's fortunes this season, is bitterly disappointed that he will
miss the World Cup in South Africa during May and June, but he has been
heartened by messages of support from the Scottish rugby public.
''People have been great. I think it was the timing of the injury more
than anything else which has got to them. It was to have been my last
club game of the season.
''I'm getting over the disappointment and just have to be positive. If
the ligament isn't torn then I will still be out for four months but
that's better than a year.''

LESS than a week before their opening match, the Scottish Claymores
have been rocked by the resignation of assistant coach Doug Williams.
Williams, who quarterbacked the Washington Redskins to Super Bowl
glory in 1988, joined the Claymores in January primarily to coach
quarterbacks and wide receivers.
A spokesman for the Claymores, who kick off their World League
campaign on Sunday at Murrayfield against Dusseldorf's Rhein Fire, said:
''Coach Williams has resigned from the Scottish Claymores due to a
difference in coaching philosophy with head coach Lary Kuharich''.
The head coach, who is renowned for his tough style, was not available
for comment yesterday.
The Claymores were being touted as pre-season favourites to lift the
World Bowl, but the loss of Williams , who previously coached at the
Navy Academy in the US, will be considerable.

The US Masters
THE week of the fifty-ninth Masters Tournament could hardly have begun
in more distinctive or dramatic terms than with the victories of Jack
Nicklaus, at the third play-off hole in the Tradition Tournament on the
US Senior Tour, and of Davis Love, at the second extra hole in the New
Orleans Open on the regular Tour.
As winner of the title a record six times, among his 18 major
triumphs, Nicklaus was already on his way to Augusta National and the
scene of his former glories. By contrast Love, who has never even
finished in the first 10 in a major, had to win to secure the last place
in this most restricted of fields.
Nicklaus, at 55, cannot be taken as a serious challenger for the first
of the season's championships. Moreover, only a few days earlier, he had
talked openly of retiring from competitive golf if his game showed no
considerable improvement.
Never one to contemplate spending his declining years as a
''ceremonial'' golfer, although he will remain loyal to his permanent
invitation to the Masters, Nicklaus attributed his eighth victory on the
Seniors Tour to the hard work needed to restore some polish to a
lustreless season so far.
Three times in the previous four weeks Love was in a position to win
after 36 holes, only to retreat sharply over the two final rounds. His
entry, like his qualification for the Masters, was at the eleventh hour
and he almost paid a penal price for losing a two-stroke lead with only
two holes to play.
However, Love's preparations could be interrupted, for tomorrow he may
join Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite im travelling to Austin, Texas, to attend
the funeral of Harvey Penick. The celebrated coach died on Sunday, aged
87, having emerged from comparative obscurity only very late in his
life.
Penick's The Little Red Book and its sequel, The Little Green Book,
sold in their thousands to golfers taken not only with the perception of
the author's insight into the game, but the shrewdly colloquial style in
which he expressed his thoughts.
For very different reasons, two other players will have occasion to
remember this championship in particular. Today has been designated as
Arnold Palmer Day in honour of the fortieth anniversary of his first
appearance in the Masters, which he won four times, and this evening
there will be a short public celebration and a presentation.
For Lee Elder, this year is memorable in quite another way. In 1975 he
became, at 40, the first black professional to play in the Masters, an
occasion encumbered by great pressure. Perhaps not surprisingly, Elder
missed the cut but he played five more times and was followed by Calvin
Peete and Jim Thorpe. That landmark has gained recognition from the
club, which has made Elder its guest of honour although he will not
actually play.
This week similar pressures will bear on Tiger Woods, at 19, the
second-youngest competitor -- by two years, to Tommy Jacobs in 1952 --
to take part. With so much expected of him, the US Amateur Champion has
a difficulty career in prospect.
Woods, who, by tradition, will play the first round on Thursday with
the holder, Jose-Maria Olazabal, yesterday had an introduction to a more
exalted rank in golf. With his British counterpart, Lee James, he
partner Nick Faldo, twice winner of the title, for practice in warm
spring sunshine.
David Gilford, who, apart from Miguel Angel Jimenez, is the only
European professional newcomer this year, elected not to seek such
expert company. Indeed, he set out on his own, as did Colin Montgomerie,
who has at least had the advantage of three previous appearances, even
if none of them was remotely successful.
There were noticeably fewer spectators, the inevitable consequence of
the club having decided to limit drastically the attendance on the three
preliminary days. Last year this was said to average 60,000 a day and
the physical discomfort, especially at Wednesday's overcrowded par-3
contest, was acute. Something had to be done.
Yet such is the attraction of this event that ticket touts are already
asking up to $350 for a Monday or Tuesday ticket with a face value of
$16, and up to $500 for a Wednesday ticket, whose normal price is $21.
There were fears that people would travel long distances unaware of the
change of policy.
Nevertheless, media bashing of the Masters continues. A television
programme on the tournament was screened last night during which the
commentator says: ''The Masters is the last dictatorship in sport. It's
the American Singapore; small and rich, efficient and successful,
spotless and humourless, and totally unforgiving.''
He continued: ''It is terribly successful and it is terribly
beautiful, but it is cold and sanctimonious -- even selfish -- giving
little back to its game or its community. Augusta National still hasn't
decided if it is merely a stuffy old man's club supported by a golf
tournament, or if it just happens to be the place every year golf is a
dream.''

SCOTTISH Pride, Scotland's largest dairy business, has announced a
restructuring which will mean the disappearance of a number of
subsidiary company names.
Kintyre Creameries, William W Stevenson, Scottish Pride Dairies,
Campbeltown Creamery, Perrat &amp; Sons, Scottish Pride Foodservice and
Cuthbertson Foods will all now operate under the name of Scottish Pride.
All of the subsidiaries affected were wholly-owned, with the exception
of Kintyre Creameries in which 3i had an investment of #1.25m. That
shareholding has been exchanged for #1.5m shares in Scottish Pride
Holdings plc -- representing 4.76% of the issued share capital.
Scottish Pride's chief executive, James Hosea, said the moves were
purely technical but they would greatly assist the company in
streamlining accounts, administration and in presenting a unified
business to the market place.
Scottish Pride's latest share dealing price for Ordinary shares of 10p
each was 37p.

ANY solution to the problems created by a drop in live calf exports
for veal production must be market led, Agriculture Minister William
Waldegrave said yesterday.
''Throwing Government subsidies at the problem -- even if I had such
largesse available, it would not go away,'' he said.
He ruled out the European calf slaughter premium, which provides
nearly #100 a head for male dairy breed calves slaughtered at under 10
days, an intervention system for young animals, and any expansion of the
beef special premium system.
What he did offer was access to the already existing market grants
under a development scheme which offers 50% of management costs up to a
maximum of #150,000. Delegates to the Meat and Livestock Commission
seminar on options for the export trade were unimpressed. The trade in
500,000 live calves is under threat.
Colin Maclean, director-general of the MLC, presented a three-part
proposal -- envisaging a total ban on exports, a 50% cut and a marginal
reduction -- which was slightly more encouraging but still pointed to
reduced profits for increased home veal or light beef production.
Alternatives had to be assessed realistically, he said.
''A headlong rush into inappropriate production systems and a failure
to communicate with customers can only lead to disappointment for
individual producers and potential damage to the whole market.''
David Gummer, retail marketing manager with Sims Food Group, a major
meat processor, took a more positive line by suggesting that
welfare-friendly British veal production based on a loose housing
system, could win more widespread consumer support and perhaps even a
premium at home and abroad which could offset its higher production
costs.
''The challenge has to be to build a perception that is worthy of such
a premium and that the very real welfare advantages that so positively
differentiate this product must be worked on in the market place,'' he
said.
But commercial realities also intervened here with consumer demand
only for the more expensive rear end cuts. The lower value fore-quarter
cuts went for manufacture competing against cheaper Dutch products.
Taking the calves on to much heavier weights under the so-called light
beef option was a viable alternative, according to John Dent, managing
director of Volac, which has pioneered calf-rearing system. It offered
high welfare, the opportunity of adding value, creating more employment
in the abattoir sector; it avoided dilution of the beef special premium
as well as loadings into intervention.
Clarke Willis, feed marketing manager for Dalgety Agriculture, agreed
that the meat industry would welcome more home production which would
provide more throughput. But he questioned how long this would last,
pointing out that with the projected decline in the diary herd, expected
to fall from 2.7m cows at present to 2.3m by the end of the decade --
there would be something like 400,000 less calves a year in any case.

JOHN MacCALMAN UNCOVERS THE FEARS OF ONE RESIDENTIAL TORY UTOPIA.
THE PROSPECT of being prisoners of socialism in their own sacred
heartland is a terrifying one for Eastwood Conservatives.
Insulated in large measure from many of the urban horrors on their
doorstep, residents were confident that the Gospel of local government
reorganisation according to the Scottish Office would perpetuate the
Conservative ethos of ''protecting decent people'' from the depredations
of the Labour Party.
With the relentless approach of Thursday's single-tier elections,
however, doubts have surfaced as the 61,000 residents of the current
Eastwood district have become more acquainted with the boundaries of
their new East Renfrewshire Council.
To this number must be added more than 27,000 from the new NUB area
(Neilston, Uplawmoor and Barrhead) -- many of whom are Labour voters.
Even dedicated Conservatives now concede that, given the current
unpopularity of the Government, there is a distinct possibility they
will not be in control of the new council and that at best they can but
hope to form a minority administration.
Opposition parties are trumpeting the collapse of the Conservative
vote, and even an intensely loyal party stalwart, regional councillor
Iain Drysdale, is now saying: ''I wouldn't underestimate the great
danger that East Renfrewshire could be Labour-controlled .
''I would warn everyone that a vote for any other party is a vote for
Labour. It could be touch-and-go because at this time, unfortunately,
the Government is unpopular. If Conservatives go out and vote as some
kind of protest, or if they don't vote at all, then there is a great
danger of letting Labour in.''
Gone would be the Conservative dream of sharing ''the Eastwood
experience'' of efficient, cost-effective services with the new East
Renfrewshire.
On the other hand Councillor Owen Taylor, Labour leader on the current
Renfrew District Council, who will be fighting one of the new Barrhead
seats, argues that gains by Labour and other opposition parties could
save the people from ''the worst excesses of right-wing Conservatism''.
While many regard the present Eastwood as some kind of residential
utopia, the area is not without its problems.
According to Liberal Democrat member, Councillor Allan Steele, the
cleansing service has suffered in recent times. While standards now
appear to have been restored, he claims that at one stage the streets
were not being swept for up to 12 or 14 weeks.
Uncleared leaves were not only a danger to traffic and pedestrians,
but were getting into the gullies and causing flooding.
He explained: ''This was caused by a cutback in the workforce,
exacerbated by illness in the remaining workforce. Then the machinery
went on the blink.''
There have also been problems of gangs drinking in public places and
putting members of the public in fear of attack.
Councillor Steele, who is trying to achieve a blanket ban on drinking
in public places, declared: ''I know people who won't use Giffnock
station. They're not worried when they get to Glasgow Central, they're
worried about getting on or off at Giffnock.''
Owen Taylor, Labour leader on Renfrew District Council, is contesting
Barrhead South with the SNP.
He said: ''Nothing would give me greater pleasure than defeating the
Conservatives in their gerrymandered homeland. The word in the streets
is that the Tory vote is collapsing. They've failed their own hard-core
voters.
''I think the Conservatives will live to regret what they've done in
terms of local government reform.''
Labour hopes to win overall control, but if the other opposition
parties also damage the Conservatives, then Labour would be prepared
''to sit down and talk''.
On the other hand, the smaller parties might do themselves irreparable
harm among many East Renfrewshire voters by treating with Labour.
There are 20 seats to be contested on the new council, 15 of them in
the current Eastwood area, and five from Neilston, Uplawmoor and
Barrhead.
Labour's Jim Fletcher is expected to retain Thornliebank, the only
seat the party holds on the current Eastwood District Council. And
Labour may just win Busby from Residents' Association candidate, Matthew
Miller, a current Eastwood councillor. Significantly, the Conservatives
are not contesting this one, nor are they attempting to dislodge a
second Residents' Association councillor, Mr Ian Pearce, at Netherlee.
The new seat of Merrylee Park should be taken by Councillor Allan
Steele for the Liberal Democrats in a straight fight with the
Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats are also targeting Giffnock North,
where there is a three-cornered contest with the Conservatives and the
SNP.
There has been controversy already at the new seat of Greenfarm, where
Liberal Democrat candidate Ella Rae has complained to the police after
receiving threatening phone calls. She is being challenged by
Conservative and SNP candidates.
Giffnock South looks solid for the Conservatives, as do Clarkston,
Williamwood, Broom, Kirkhill and Mearns. Said a local Conservative
activist: ''If the Conservatives can't hold these wards they won't be
able to hold anything.''
At Crookfur, the Provost of Eastwood, Mr Leslie Rosin, is having to
beat off challenges from the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Labour and an
Independent, but should hold on.
Stamperland is thought to be vulnerable for the Conservatives where
the sitting councillor, Mr Ian Simpson, is facing strong challenges from
the SNP, Liberal Democrats and Labour.
There is also a worry for the Conservatives at Eaglesham, where
Councillor Basil Baird is being challenged by Labour and the SNP.
Given that much of the new area coming into Eastwood is strongly
Labour, the swing against the Conservatives doesn't need to be that
great to take them into a minority situation.
It would be something of a feat for the Conservatives to get anything
out of the five Barrhead wards.
However, Labour itself could be vulnerable to the SNP in Barrhead
East, where an Independent Labour candidate is complicating the issue,
and at Councillor Owen Taylor's power base at Barrhead South. That would
fragment the opposition even more.
Looking at East Renfrewshire as a whole, if the Conservatives can hold
on to the retired vote and get it turned out to vote tomorrow then their
position could be much improved.
On the positive side, the state pension has gone up quite well, and
building society deposits are starting to pay higher returns.
Another possible plus for the Conservatives is that many people in
Eastwood might be very glad they've got this council of their own that's
nothing to do with Strathclyde, and the only people they could thank for
that would be the Conservatives.
People look at their council tax and see how little they pay to
Eastwood and how much they pay to Strathclyde.
At the end of the day it could be a very mixed council. It would be a
major achievement for any of the other parties to get more councillors
than the Conservatives. Even if they are in a minority, they're likely
to be the largest party.
Then again, the election could result in a hung council, and that
would give a completely new meaning to ''the Eastwood Experience.''

GLASGOW-based firms are lagging behind the rest of Scotland when it
comes to realising their export potential, according to Glasgow
Development Agency chairman Forbes Macpherson.
Announcing the winners of a GDA-run competition designed to boost
export potential yesterday, Mr Macpherson said there was clearly a great
deal of export potential among Glasgow companies which was not being
realised.
Although there are 17,000 companies based in Glasgow, the city
accounts for just 6.2% of Scotland's total exports. ''There is no doubt
at present that Glasgow's exporters are underperforming in some sectors
compared to their counterparts elsewhere in Scotland and the UK, hence
the need for this scheme,'' he said.
The five winners of the International Executive Scheme are California
Cake &amp; Cookie in Govan; Carrick Jewellery, which has factories in Govan
and Livingston; interior designers Crawford &amp; Sons; quilted products
manufacturers Polywarm Products in Rutherglen; and cleaner and aerosol
producers Sanmex International in Rutherglen. Each will receive #20,000
to help them develop their export potential and an assistance package.
At the moment Sanmex, which employs 180 staff, exports around 20% of
their products while the other four companies, which employ between 25
and 200 people, export just 5%.
''I am proud that the International Executive Scheme will help five of
Glasgow's best exporters to unlock that potential. This should have a
significant impact on the local economy,'' he said.
The companies were judged on their commitment to growth and overseas
development.

JOHN McGinlay admitted that he shed a tear or two on Sunday after
Bolton Wanderers lost in the Coca-Cola Cup final to Liverpool at
Wembley. It was uncharacteristic and, by the time I spoke with the
Scotland and Bolton striker, the tears had been wiped away and a more
pragmatic approach had taken over.
McGinlay had been the man Bolton fans had looked to as they went to
Wembley for the first time in almost 40 years for a major final. It was
his name they chanted, his exploits in earlier rounds they celebrated,
and when he failed to deliver victory the Highlander simply collapsed in
the centre circle.
''I have never done that before,'' he admitted. ''It was not like me
at all but I think that the whole event simply got to me. I'd only ever
been at Wembley before as a punter, out there with the rest of the fans
supporting Scotland.
''Now, here I was playing there. When I walked out and heard the
noise, it was devastating. It just hit you in the face and you realised
where you were.
''I have never felt anything like that before and, so, at the end I
just broke down.''
But the depression did not last too long. By the time the players were
beginning to get on to the team bus to take them back to their hotel,
McGinlay was having a beer -- and looking on the bright side of life.
He insisted: ''This can still be the best season of my career. I have
so much to play for with my club and with Scotland.
''Bolton can still win promotion to the Premiership. The worst I see
us getting is a play-off and, if that happens, then we already have been
at Wembley for a big game and will be able to handle the occasion.
''But, what we have to do now is treat this whole thing Coca-Cola Cup
episode as a bit of a fairytale. That's what it has been, after all.
''We cannot allow it to divert us from promotion. The manager, Bruce
Rioch, felt our cup games last season diverted us from the main aim --
getting into the Premiership.
''That won't happen this time. We have that little bit more
experience. We can handle it. But, for me, there are also the Scotland
games.
''By the end of this season, if we can get things right, then we can
be close to qualification for the finals. That is important to me and
everyone in the squad.
''We can win our away games against San Marino and the Faroes that
would set us up for our home games. I reckon we can do it.
''We have to go and impose ourselves on these teams. We have to work
hard, attack them, and treat the games as if they are at Hampden. If we
do that we will win and then let the others worry about coming to
Glasgow.
''Wembley was a downer, but there is still a lot to play for. That is
what I have to look at. The crying is over, the celebrations are still
ahead.''

THE Human Performance Laboratory at the College of Nautical Studies in
Glasgow echoed to the sounds of second-year pupils from Braidhurst High
School in Motherwell undergoing a battery of 15 fitness tests.
''That cycling machine left me a bit out of puff,'' admitted Allyn
Backer. ''I play football and golf, and think I'm quite fit but that was
hard.''
''It's good fun, but it takes a bit of doing,'' said Samantha Black.
''Outside school I don't do much in the way of sport -- sometimes I play
football but I don't know the rules.''
The apparatus in the laboratory was being used to check power, levels
of body fat and aerobic and cardiovascular fitness. In a gymnasium
downstairs, other pupils were taking field tests recognised by the
Scottish Sports Council. In every case, they were being monitored -- and
their performance measured -- by Mary Collins, head of the college's
school of sport and leisure, and her staff, and by Higher National
Diploma students taking courses in sports coaching and development.
Senior lecturer Christine Nash and her colleague Jackie Lothian
predicted that, by the end of the testing session, ''the majority of the
pupils, despite putting in a great deal of effort, will come out below
average, though a few are doing extremely well''.
The HND students can do 20 minutes on the treadmill, and the pupils
should be able to manage just under half of that but some were failing
to do so. The college would issue a fitness profile for each student, to
be analysed by Braidhurst, whose principal teacher of PE, John Watson,
had organised the testing session at the college.
According to one of the school's PE staff, Mhairi Kirkpatrick, the
implications of each profile would then be discussed with individual
pupils to see how improvement could be achieved.
The visit to the College of Nautical Studies has to be viewed in a
much wider context. Braidhurst High -- serving an area of deprivation,
Forgewood -- has a roll of only about 500 pupils. Thanks to the
admirable commitment of its staff, it is putting into effect its policy
of providing for the differing needs of every pupil.
At a time when the shift from content-based to skills-based teaching
is gaining momentum, teachers felt the need to support pupils in
techniques of finding out information for themselves, thus giving them
the key to greater access to knowledge throughout their lives. The head
teacher, Derrick Hannan, therefore set up a staff group to investigate
information skills across the curriculum.
The outcome of their deliberations was a first-year project last
session involving the English, science, art and social subjects
departments, plus the resource librarian, Eileen McCluskey, and the
principal teacher of learning support, Rita Archibald, who took
responsibility for adapting for the wide range of pupil ability source
materials to be used in the project.
The theme of the project was ''Animals''. Pupils had to gather
information about their chosen animal, organise it, and present and
explain it to their class. Teachers practised with the pupils in advance
the skills of skimming, scanning, note-taking and presentation.
The success of the initiative encouraged Braidhurst to continue it
with the same pupils this year, reinforcing and extending the skills.
This time the topic was to be ''Sport'', and the PE department was
invited to join the staff committee. An evaluation of the pilot project
suggested that even more tailoring of the material to suit the differing
pupil abilities was required, and this was carried out.
The topic was sub-divided into three headings -- diet for a healthy
lifestyle; information about a sport; and fitness. Strathclyde's
Catering Direct was invited in to help promote healthy eating, with
specific categories of food targeted over a four-week period. Pupils
purchasing from the nominated food range were given tickets to
participate in a prize draw each week, and Catering Direct staff judged
the entries in a poster competition which formed part of the S2 project.
The pupils themselves selected the sport on which to try out their
information skills. Samantha Black chose motor racing and Allyn Backer
golf from a list ranging from American football to skiing.
The third element was personal fitness, and the testing session
certainly caught the imagination of the Braidhurst pupils. ''They've
been well briefed,'' said biology teacher George Collin. ''Some of them
may be finding it hard going, but they're thoroughly enjoying it.''
The project has been valuable in showing pupils that skills are
transferable. However, the advantages have not stopped there. Rita
Archibald said: ''Teachers have benefited too, through a deeper
understanding of just how interdependent subject areas are, and how
support in any one area has an influence beyond it.''

Jack McLean recommends some childhood favourites which still have the
power to capture his imagination.
COINCIDENCES happen quite a lot. When Radio 4 ran a serial of Oliver
Twist recently, I went to the bookcase and brought out the novel. And
read it: first time in years. It had been damn near a lodestone when I
was a child. I first encountered the book when I was six and putative
Uncle Bill bought me a wonderfully illustrated version published by DC
Thomson and illustrated at that by the amazing Dudley D. Watkins. It
influenced my entire life.
I was perhaps eight or nine when I read the actual book for the first
time, and I read it over and over again, and each time the drawings of
the earlier volume sparked into life and I made a movie every time in my
imagination. I read it the other week and was back as a child, saw as a
child, spake as a child; never put away childish things, and certainly
not Oliver Twist.
My family is horribly aware of how well I know this early-ish Dickens
novel: I can quote damn-near every page. With what satisfaction do I
discover that Mr and Mrs Bumble end in the very workhouse in which
Oliver picked oakem and asked for more, what relish to find that the
Gentleman in the White Waistcoat went to his Last Judgement the week
before the mealiest of mealy boys encountered his native town to send
his half brother to perdition.
It was perdition, too. Edward Leeford -- Monks -- eventually died of
chronic alcoholism in the Americas. Bentley Drummell croaked it
splendidly in Great Expectations as the result of, Dickens said: ''the
abuse of a horse.'' Dickens had some marvellous end-pieces in his
melodramas. Coincidences are the stuff of Dickens' plots. Last week saw
one of equal proportions. As I re-read the very origin of my childhood
literacy did I not have a request from a child who is only 10, the age I
was when I was reading every damned thing Dickens wrote, and going
through the canon of what was once called classic novels.
Certainly they were called ''classics''. The volume of Oliver Twist
which I read the other week was one of the Nelson Classics, which
everybody over forty-odd will remember. And I read them all. Some of
them would be impenetrable by today's adults let alone yesterday's
children. I read Roderick Random and Robinson Crusoe. And Little Women,
and John Halifax, Gentleman and . . . dear heavens, everything.
I ventured into the world of Bunyan and Bronte, Macauley and Marryat,
Scott and Stevenson, ach, everywhere, into the lush undergrowths of mid
and late Victorian and Edwardian novels. You have to be very old or very
odd to remember Silas K. Hocking, but I do -- his most famous novel was
Her Benny. Not only did I read it and weep over it 40 years ago, I also
own Silas K. Hocking's autobiography, a tome which proves once and for
all that eminent Victorians were even weirder than Lytton Strachey was,
and that is saying much.
I suspect that few under 40 years of age have heard of Strachey
either. Age counts a lot when we speak of books, and by another
coincidence it counted horribly the other week because young Anna Coyle,
a 10-year-old cheil at the rather splendid St Mark's Primary in Glasgow
got her daddy, a pal of mine, to tell me about the competition organised
by The Libraries Association of Scotland.
The children were to contact three adults and ask them what books they
would recommend for weans of their age group. And then the little ones
would review the books. I thought of Roderick Random and Robinson Crusoe
and then especially of Oliver Twist. And then I thought again. My
childhood possessed an Edwardian and indeed Victorian dimension to its
consciousness. We are over a century away from that, and maybe a
millenium from Empire. Yet I have hardly read a child's novel which has
been written in the last 30 years. What do I know? What can I say?
A lot really. I told Anna about some novels which have had sort of
comeback. Black Beauty and Little Women have returned as recent films.
Multi-million dollar movies: I'll bet they are just as bad as their
predecessors in the history of film. I re-read both books and ended up
wanting to poison the entire March family with steaks cut from the
foam-flecked hind quarters of Anna Sewell's eponymous, if
anthropomorphic, hero, they both were that saccherine. After that you
wanted to feed Jo March hacked in bits by Lizzie Borden to Uncle Tom's
entire family in his cabin. Ralph, Jack and Peterkin would be forced to
look on as they starved on their coral island.
But finally I came up with a novel for Anna. The Secret Garden By
Frances Hodgson Burnett. It too has been the subject of films and many a
telly serial. It is a story for both boys and girls: it is a story for
all the little boys and girls like me who had a wee secret garden
ourselves, one the adults either knew not about, or kept secret the fact
that they knew about it. It was a fecund garden you could cultivate
yourselves, you grew fantasies and ideas naturally like the plants, you
grew fragrant as the flowers.
Enid Blyton told of children away from adults and so did Richmal
Crompton: other lives indeed. But then we spake as a child, we saw
through a glass darkly. I could have given a lot of books to young Anna,
many of them wildly away from her own experience as a child. Books for
children are straight out of Alice. Eat me. Drink me. Be bigger and be
smaller. Don't fit. The truth is that Alice wasn't in Wonderland: she
was in Dante's parish. Have you ever read Barrie's Peter Pan? It isn't
Walt Disney at all. It is the darkness of childhood, when you are slight
and your skin is wonderfully smooth and you are not clever at all. In my
case, when you were sick and lay abed in the wonderful world of
counterpane. When you believe the big people will be good and they give
you books to improve and expand your minds. When girls and boys knew
what their lives were, sort of going to be about, and sexuality was ever
there and how to go about being different sexes was . . . Why talk about
it.
The novel I suggested was about more than that. For a start it was a
damned good read. Glad to tell Anna of it too. The Secret Garden is more
secret than you think. Adults give The Secret Garden to nieces and, if
they have any sense, to nephews as well; have done for a century. A
coincidence? That's the secret really, itself. It is about the ultimate
secret: what do you think of yourself: how do others think of you. Being
you, do you live for ever. The Secret Garden has a chance of getting
damn near it.

Dick Louden reports on the first moves to merge the big two Scottish
awarding bodies.
WITH the new, unified curriculum and assessment regime proposed under
Higher Still now less than two years away, the two national awarding
bodies -- the Scottish Examination Board (SEB) and the Scottish
Vocational Education Council (Scotvec) -- could face amalgamation as the
result of a consultation document just issued by the Scottish Office.
The document raises four options but then virtually rejects three,
while seeking views on all four. The options are to:
* Allocate to one of the two bodies the responsibility for Higher
Still. Under existing legislation, this would have to be the SEB, which
in terms of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 has the express function
of conducting secondary school examinations and awarding certificates.
This would not be a productive way of enhancing parity of esteem between
SEB and Scotvec awards.
* Give the two bodies joint responsibilty for implementing Higher
Still. Closer links could be achieved through more cross-membership but
confusion would remain over the respective roles of the SEB and Scotvec.
Efficiency savings would be ruled out in the longer term, and there
would be no competent way under the present legislation in which
satisfactory administrative and financial arrangements could be put in
place.
* Set up a new independent body to implement Higher Still, with the
SEB and Scotvec left to carry out their remaining functions. This would
lead to further fragmentation, with three bodies instead of two, would
be more costly and would place an organisational barrier in the way of a
single system of certification.
* Set up a new organisation to take over all the existing functions of
the SEB and Scotvec. Its role, constitution and finances would be
subject to parliamentary approval. It would be simpler to understand,
would enable the experience of both bodies to be pooled, and would make
it easier to create educational bridges throughout the system.
The Scottish Office is therefore ''inclined to prefer a new body'' and
is unlikely to meet too much opposition during the consultative process.
Indeed, it has taken a decisive first step by appointing David Miller,
chairman of Scotvec, to chair the SEB as well.
Nobody is better qualified to achieve a marriage of the academic and
the vocational. After studying at Edinburgh Academy and Emmanuel
College, Cambridge, graduating with Honours in Law, he joined J &amp; P
Coats as a trainee, moving through the ranks to become group personnel
and PR director of the new Coats Viyella plc in 1986. He took early
retirement four years ago and now holds two other chairmanships --
Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries and Stirling University Court -- and
is a director of Scottish Life, Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the Institute
of Management and Forth Valley Enterprise.
His initiation into policy-making in education came in 1978, when he
was first appointed to the Court of Stirling University. ''I hope I may
have helped them to understand how the world outside perceived them,''
he says. ''I was critically aware of the importance of training, and the
extent to which Scotland lagged behind. We needed to replace an
amateurish approach with the pursuit of excellence.
''Things have certainly improved but some employers have still to be
convinced that staff training offers benefits for them as well as their
employees. They fear a loss of return if staff move out after
training.''
The SEB and Scotvec have very different backgrounds and cultures and
are located 50 miles apart -- in Dalkeith and Glasgow. With longer
experience of Scotvec, he describes it as ''a highly efficient
organisation which breeds quality. It has made great advances in under
10 years. Its internal assessment procedures must now be reconciled with
a national tradition of formal external testing. It must also achieve a
wider public perception of what it does.''
Having recently taken over the SEB chair, David Miller has ''an
enormous amount to learn.'' His impression is of ''an organisation with
a high international reputation. It conducts a very smooth operation and
provides a service of quality. It would benefit further if it enjoyed
the flexible funding arrangements which enable Scotvec to respond
promptly to rapid change.''
In the event of a merger, could the merged bodies operate from two
different locations in Dalkeith and Glasgow? ''If it came to that, I
don't see why not. A single location has obvious advantages but would it
be wise to put that consideration above the support of staffs who are
happy where they are and are working to great effect?''
What are the unresolved issues connected with a merger, whether on one
site or two? ''There is the question of board representation -- the
method of selection and the size of the board, which varies
significantly between the SEB and Scotvec,'' says Mr Miller. ''In
addition, we would have to enhance the two computing systems to make
them fully compatible.''
What does the Scottish Office expect of its new appointee in an
exercise which, until the advent of Higher Still, it had seemed
reluctant to tackle? ''I think they see me as someone who might make
progress through consensus. They want me to avoid conflict between the
interested parties, and build on the existing goodwill.''
He is convinced that Higher Still could ''take us a great deal closer
to academic and vocational parity than ever before''. The name of
General Scottish Vocational Qualifications, Scotvec's new awards which
cover broad vocational areas, ''may disappear under the new system but
the principle on which they are based -- of broad vocational groupings
or bandings -- will remain.''
The Scottish Office has chosen well -- with the added bonus of David
Miller's experience of a corporate merger when Coats Viyella plc was
established. Few will disagree with his general approbation of schooling
in Scotland, or with his belief that ''our universities are comparable
with anywhere else but the technician area is still worrying''. His
reputation as an urbane and knowledgeable chairman should ensure that
the SEB and Scotvec merge in the next few years. If not, they never
will.

THE dollar remained under pressure in spite of intervention by the
Federal Reserve, estimated at $1000m.
The actions of the Fed encouraged profit-taking. The outlook for the
US currency remains poor and further tests of 86.00 yen, its recent low
point against the Japanese currency, appear to lie ahead.
With dealers attention focused on the dollar/yen, trading in European
currencies tended to be quiet.
Sterling was weaker on a trade-weighted basis, losing 0.3 of its value
to 85.0. It moved in narrow ranges and ended down half-a-pfennig against
the German mark at DM2.2217 and was more than a cent weaker than the
dollar at $1.6158.

FOUR Scots golfers set off yesterday on a pioneering trip to the Far
East to take part in the inaugural, five-tournament Volvo China Tour,
which begins next Monday with the Shenzhen Open just over the Border and
north of Hong Kong.
Garry Harvey (Grangemouth), Brian Dunbar (Easter Moffat),
Germany-based Simon Yates, and David Thomson (Kings Links) all will play
in the first four 36-hole events, and if they are then in the top 35 on
the order of merit, or sponsor's invitations are forthcoming, they will
compete in the concluding 72-hole China Open -- also an Asian Tour event
-- at Beijing from April 27 to 30.
Originally, a group of six younger golfers were to make the trip
organised by the Edinburgh-based Govenlock Golf Management company, but
the necessary sponsorship was not forthcoming and so players able to
finance the trip themselves, some with private backing, are going
instead.
The company's Stephen Govenlock, whose objective is the promotion of
young professional golfers, had made inquiries about tournament
opportunities worldwide in our pre-season period, and as a result six
places on the China Tour, comprising 125 players, 85% of them Asian,
were confirmed in January.
The four Scots, therefore, also will be ambassadors. Accordingly, they
are all taking kilts to wear at official functions plus gifts such as
haggis and shortbread.
Thomson is better known as a coach than a player -- most notably as an
early guru of Paul Lawrie -- and has never before been on tour. However,
he is renowned as a big-hitter, and with an arthritis problem in his
left wrist virtually eliminated thanks to regular intake of that now
popular elixir, the New Zealand Green-lipped Mussel, he is optimistic.
He also is hopeful of benefiting from another Kiwi input, a putting
lesson from Simon Owen, who visited the Aberdeen golf range to spread
the gospel according to the latest instruction method, Natural Golf.
Of the China trip, Thomson said: ''It is the chance of a lifetime. I
have always wanted to visit that part of the world and if I don't go
now, I might never do it.''
Prize-money at the first four events will be $50,000 -- more than any
Tartan Tour event except for the Scottish Professional Championship --
and $400,000 at the China Open. Govenlock reckons that if the Scots play
to their known abilities, they will more than recoup their stakes of
just under #3000.
Harvey, who is sponsored by Calor Gas and has more than 10 seasons on
the European Tour behind him, plus a victory in the Kenyan Open, is
enthusiastic about the adventure. ''It is a unique opportunity and a
chance to get out and play before the Tartan Tour starts. I don't think
the competition is too strong, but it is an unknown quantity.''
Dunbar is a Tartan Tour stalwart and his trip is being backed by a
group of Chinese restaurateurs who comprise the Glasgow-based Chinese
Golfing Society, and Yates, formerly based at the Royal Burgess Golfing
Society in Edinburgh, has been making his mark in Germany, winning last
season a Satellite Tour event.
An attempt was made to arrange a Scotland-China international, but
Govenlock was told this was something for the future, as China have only
three pros -- not surprising since golf restarted in the country only 10
years ago after a 40-year ban.
In these 10 years golf has boomed, and behind the inaugural tour is
the American-educated Hong Kong Chinese Aylwin Tai, who was behind the
formation in 1985 of the first group of Chinese golfers at the Chung
Shan Hot Spring club in Zhongshan. He is working in partnership with
Scot Alistair Polson, a fellow director of Hong Kong-based Richmond
Worldwide Limited.
After Shenzhen, the tour moves to the Honichi Golf Resort for the
Honichi Open (April 13 and 14), then to Xilie Golf Club for the Hugo
Boss Open (April 18 and 19), and on to the Arnold Palmer-designed
Mission Hills Golf Club, venue of the World Cup in October, for the
Coca-Cola Open (April 21 and 22).

Tokyo, Monday -- The unstoppable Japanese yen and the country's stock
market collided today, causing share prices to fall nearly 5% as the
currency defied rare intervention by the US Federal Reserve in Asian
markets.
''The market doesn't like Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's cabinet,
the Bank of Japan or the Finance Ministry. It expects the economy to go
into a double dip -- that's what it is now trying to discount,'' said a
trader at a British securities house.
Stockbrokers said the odds were in favour of a further decline in
share prices unless the BoJ stepped in and substantially cut the
official discount rate.
Currency dealers also indicated that a discount rate cut was the only
certain way to stop the surging value of the yen, which has appreciated
some 17% since the start of 1995.
''Given flagging shares and the mighty yen, the BoJ will have to put
its best card on the table . . . a discount rate cut,'' said Hirokazu
Note, chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank.
''However, it is buying time by intervention, preferably with the
American Federal Reserve Bank, before resorting to the ultimate
action.''
The surprise intervention by the Fed to prop up the dollar during
Asian trade failed to sway markets, which doubt the US's determination
to defend its currency.
The Fed, in its first currency market appearance in Asian trading time
in over three years, intervened three times during the day with a first
foray by buying dollars at around 86.50 yen and above, then at 86.85-90
yen and at 86.70-75.
It also bought dollars for marks in Singapore when the dollar fell to
a low of DM1.3680 in early Asian trade. The dollar set a new record low
of 86.30 yen in New York on Friday.
The Fed's intervention in Tokyo hours was the first since February
1992, when it sold dollars at around 128.20/25 yen jointly with the BoJ.
Worries that the yen's increasing value against other major currencies
such as the dollar would erode Japanese exporters' profits and stifle a
tentative economic recovery drove Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average
758.66 points (4.70%) lowers to 15,381.29, making a 22% fall since the
beginning of the year.
''The market is sending a signal with this fall that substantial
measures are needed in view of the yen's rise,'' said Manji Ueda,
general manager at Nomura Securities.
''To slow this market down there has to be a cut in the official
discount rate of at least 75 basis points to have any impact,'' said
Paul Migliorato, salesman at Jardine Fleming.
The official discount rate, or the rate at which the BoJ lends money
to commercial banks, currently stands at a historic low of 1.75%.
Traders said even a cut in the official discount rate of 50 basis
points would be unlikely to stem the market's decline.
The ailing dollar may have been given a minor lift by the Fed
intervention, but the US currency is unlikely to make a substantial
recovery soon, dealers said.
''There is no hope over the next two weeks unless there is a technical
correction, or unless the Fed changes its stance,'' said Yumiko Iijima,
currency analyst at MMS International.
''The Fed's move was very symbolic, just a way of showing that
co-ordination between central banks is intact. If they were really
concerned about the dollar, they would have done something last Friday,
or even earlier,'' Iijima said. -- Reuter.

MAURICE Saatchi's New Saatchi advertising agency has signed an
co-operation pact with French group Publicis.
It said yesterday that the pact would kick off with a joint
presentation to British Airways for global management of its
advertising.
Publicis will support the New Saatchi Agency with logistical and
technical services, as well as media strategy, planning and buying, Mr
Saatchi's agency said.
But it said the co-operation agreement involved no equity exchange
between, or participation in, the two agencies.
''Publicis has a formidable international presence and together we can
manage outstanding global communications for the largest accounts,''
said Maurice Saatchi who was ousted as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi,
now renamed Cordiant, at the turn of the year.

''LET'S be Frank, Bruno. We both want to go for gold in Glasgow.''
That seems to be the message delivered as much in fun as in earnest when
the two met up in the city yesterday.
Bruno, who hopes to have a fourth shot at the world heavyweight
championship this summer, yesterday became the latest celebrity English
boxer to embrace Glasgow as a fighting base when he paid a visit to the
city to publicise his next contest -- against Ray Anis at the Kelvin
Hall on May 13.
Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank, Naseem Hamed, and Dennis Andries are among
the world-class boxers who have travelled north in recent years, and
have been given tremendous support in Glasgow, which arguably now can
call itself the boxing capital of Britain because most of its
championship promotions are virtual sell-outs.
And Bruno can look for the same kind of response for the show in May,
which will be sponsored by Glasgow District Council. He already has a
head-start in that he is one of the best-loved sportsmen in the country,
despite the fact that some of his fights, against less than credible
opponents, have been finished in less time than it takes a spectator to
find his seat.
We are assured that Anis, a 28-year-old who was born in Haiti but
fights out of America, is a worthy man to share the Glasgow ring with
Bruno. Said Frank Warren, who will promote the show in association with
Katherine Morrison: ''Anis is rated No.23 by the World Boxing Council
and he is a good, durable opponent who has lost only once -- on points
-- in 20 contests.''
Bruno himself doesn't know too much about a man he must beat to retain
his dream of meeting either Oliver McCall or Larry Holmes for the WBC
title. McCall puts that title on the line against Holmes in Las Vegas
this weekend.
Frank Warren then revealed that Glasgow would be a candidate to host
the championship contest. ''Why not? We have always had a tremendous
response from the Scottish boxing public,'' he said. ''And it is not
outrageous, either, to suggest that if Frank wins the world title, his
first defence could also be in Glasgow -- against Mike Tyson.''
Warren announced that there will also be two British championship
contests, among 13 fights, on the bill for May 13. Dennis Andries, of
Hackney, will defend his cruiserweight title against an opponent who
will be named on Thursday, and Del Bryan, of Nottingham, will defend the
welter title against Brixton's Gary Logan.
Scots who will feature are light-heavy John Wilson, feather Brian
Carr, and bantam James Murray.

LIKE every Hibernian supporter, the club's chairman, Douglas Cromb, is
anxious to witness an end to a depressing run of failure which is only
seven years short of a century. The Easter Road side have not won the
Scottish Cup for 93 years and that, along with the dilapidated condition
of the stadium is a source of great embarrassment to the chairman.
However, a Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic at Ibrox on
Friday night and work on bringing the ground up to an acceptable
standard offer fresh hope and enthusiasm for everyone connected with the
Edinburgh club.
Cromb's eyes scanned Easter Road yesterday as manager Alex Miller
began preparing his players for the semi and shrugged his shoulders.
''Look at the place,'' he instructed while pointing to the main stand.
''It's a tip.
''There hasn't been any investment here for a long time and the
players and supporters have suffered because of that lack of investment.
It has been a disgrace.''
Cromb, of course, was referring to the inadequacies of previous
directors, but as mechanical diggers worked on the first of two new
stands which will be ready just after the start of next season at a cost
of just more than #4m -- capacity will be increased to 16,000 -- the
chairman's face creased into a smile. Once that debt has been addressed,
rebuilding of the main stand will be tackled and then Hibs will have a
decent ground.
''It will be one which we will all be proud of,'' said Cromb, who
knows that redevelopment plans could be accelerated significantly if
Hibs were to beat Celtic and go on and win the cup. ''We will get money
from the semi-final, more from the final, and if we were to get into
Europe by winning the trophy that kind of money would be more than
welcome,'' Cromb said.
Apart from the fact Celtic would not take kindly to hearing their
opponents talk already of the amounts of money European football could
generate, it is unwise to look too far ahead. High finance is guaranteed
only if the European opposition is of a quality high enough to interest
television companies.
For instance, last time Hibs were in Europe -- they played Anderlecht
in the UEFA Cup in 1992 -- their share of television money was only
#25,000 because of lack of widespread interest in the tie which the
Belgians won on the away goals rule, but if Hibs were to reach Europe
again and then drew, say an Italian side they could benefit by as much
as #300,000.
Naturally, the banks would want to see most of that kind of money but
an effort would be made to allow Miller another look at the transfer
market. ''The great trick is trying to get the stadium rebuilt and also
keep a decent side on the park,'' Cromb said.
''So far, I believe we are getting the balance right and the manager
has helped a great deal because he does not make demands. He knows what
has to be done here.
''In fact, I often think that if Alex hadn't been a foobtall manager
he would have done very well in business. We have a very good
relationship, we're more like friends who respect one another.''
How long, though, can Hibs hold on to a manager, who has forged a
reputation for himself in football circles after a difficult start at
Easter Road when fans regularly called for his head? ''I don't know,''
Cromb replied, ''but I do know he is ambitious and that he has ambitions
for Hibs.''
Having gathered around him players who form the best squad he has had
in his time at Easter Road, the manager's immediate ambition is to take
the club back into European football and he is pursuing that objective
down two avenues. Winning the cup is one way and finishing high enough
in the premier division another.
It will not be easy to reach the end of either route, but Miller has a
confidence in his players. ''Watching them train yesterday I could see
they had an edge and I know they will be ready for this tie,'' he said.
''It will be important that they play to their capabilities on Friday
night in Glasgow where Celtic will start as favourites and have a larger
support.''
Indeed, it will be because in season 1988-89 Celtic and Hibs met in
the semi-finals of the same competition and the tie was won and lost
within the first half-hour when Celtic, who eventually won 3-1, were
three goals in front. ''In fact, the game was lost by us after only
three minutes when poor marking at a corner allowed Celtic to score,''
Miller said.
''We didn't perform at all that day, yet I went into that game feeling
confident that we would win. This time we will be ready.''
It goes without saying Jim Leighton will be one of Hibs' key players
and the keeper, who has been given a new lease of life at Easter Road,
has not lost a goal in four matches, including Scotland's World Cup
qualifying tie against Russia last week. ''He has been magnificent this
season,'' said the captain, Gordon Hunter.
Miller will take his squad out of Edinburgh and into a retreat -- the
players will not know where they are heading until they board the team
bus -- where he will work on their minds as much as set-piece plays and
strategy. ''We will examine our strengths, but we will also look at
Celtic's strengths and weaknesses,'' he said.
The Hibs manager has had Celtic watched over the past few weeks and
has detailed reports which he will study throughout the week. ''But I
won't ask any of my players to do anything he isn't sure of,'' Miller
added. ''There will be pressure on us to do well, but if we can't cope
with the pressure at this stage what would we be like in a final?
''Also, I believe that if there is anyone who can't handle this kind
of pressure he shouldn't be in football.''
Miller, who has two cup winner's medals and two losers from his time
with Rangers, has already decided on his team and he might not have
found a starting place for Kevin Harper. The 19-year-old might have to
content himself with a place in the dug-out.
Whatever, happens in the cup tie, Miller's place at the club will
remain secure, with Cromb saying: ''It was suggested to me when I came
here three-and-a-half years ago that Alex was not the right manager, but
I felt otherwise and stood by him.
''That was the correct decision then, and I stand by him now. He is an
excellent manager and I'm only sorry I can't give him one or two million
pounds to spend on new players.''
Perhaps, though, if all goes well on Friday and in their remaining six
league matches, Hibs will win a European place and earn some big money.
Only then might Miller start demanding his share for players.

BURMAH Castrol has the right winning formula with Castrol which owes
something to the underlying product quality and probably more to the
success of a management organisation. That has allowed local initiative
rather than the head office at Swindon to dictate strategy.
Given the growth occuring in Asia where Thailand is a more important
market for Castrol lubricants than the UK, and recovery beginning to
take place in Europe to back up last year's strong growth in North
America, there could be a desire to make major acquisitions.
Happily, that seems not to be the case with nothing other than bolt-on
acquisitions being contemplated.
The company raised pre-tax profits last year by 21% to #219m, ignoring
exceptional items which were overall positive to the tune of #24m, and
earnings by 25% to #114m.
Castrol raised volumes by 7% compared with a global growth in GDP of
3% and an overall rise in demand for lubricants of just over 1%. Part of
the success has come from aggressive marketing.
Promotion overall amounted to a revealed 8% of turnover of about
#150m. The company was among the first to enter developing markets such
as India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
However, the best margins are those achieved in Britain and
continental Europe. Overall margins rose from 9.5% to 10.3% and should
further advance to 12% in 1995 with price increases above inflation
successfully introduced in most markets.
In the US, Castrol has a 16% market share in the DIY market which is
the most important segment and could overtake Pennzoil as industry
leader within 18 months. Syntec accounts for half segment sales but
group chief executive Jonathan Fry is disappointed that less than 3% of
motorists wish to use such a high-technology synthetic oil in their
cars.
Tbe reluctance of chairman Lawrence Urquhart to make acquisitions of
any great size may well be a continuing reaction to having bought Foseco
at the wrong time just before the European steel and foundry industries
went into tailspin in 1990.
That activity is now coming right with profits ahead by 34% to #48.9m
and with margins for the full year of 6.4% and which should be 10% this
time round as Germany recovers momentum in its car industry in
particular.
Screen printing inks are highly successful but the Serticol subsidiary
does need to be bigger to exploit its technology. The snag is that there
are few opportunities for purchase.
But there are some blots for the company. One is petrol retailing
where Burmah is being hammered in the UK by the supermarkets. Its share
is just under 2.5% compared with about 8% at Tesco which makes a margin
from what was once a loss leader of about 3p per gallon.
Burmah's profitability is partly dependent on the deals it can strike
with the major refiners and the ability to select stations far enough
away from supermarkets and other discounters. The operation is run for
cash and no reasonable offer for the whole subsidiary would be refused.
Fuel retailing also suffered in Turkey and there were few signs of
encouragement throughout the activity which dropped 19% to #20.7m.
Indonesian natural gas contributed less because of a reduced number of
shipments to Japan and delicate negotiations are under way because
carrier contracts will begin to run out at the end of next year to
create a little uncertainty about what has been a low-risk contributor
to profits in recent years.
Helped by the sale of property in Singapore for #51m, there are no
balance sheet restraints which should encourage an above average
dividend distribution policy for the near future.
The 1995 total has been raised 18% for a UK resident taxpayer to 32.5p
with a final cash payment of 10p and a foreign income dividend of 12.5p
which is based on overseas earnings remitted to the UK for a 4.6% yield
with the shares at 874p.
The underlying quality of lubricants profits and the recovery coming
through in chemicals points to current year earnings reaching #135m
without difficulty.
One should feel warmly toward a stock which is trading at just over 12
times likely earnings and is standing at an unjustified discount to the
market.

ABERDEEN chairman Ian Donald yesterday denied that he had deserted his
stricken club in their time of need.
He came under fire from his own supporters' association for missing
the crucial relegation match against Kilmarnock on Saturday to go on a
skiing holiday.
But Donald explained: ''I go on holiday every year at this time. I
took my family away when the club were challenging for league and cup
honours. I cannot see why there should be so much fuss because I
maintained that tradition this time round.
''This is the time for caretaker manager Roy Aitken to be left to do
his job. The directors and myself have been delighted with the manner in
which Roy has worked hard to lift the players' confidence since he took
over.
''We all have one desire -- that is to see Aberdeen remain in the
premier division.
''That is why it is important Roy should be the main spokesman for the
club between now and the end of the season.''
Meanwhile, Aitken admitted yesterday that Aberdeen are running out of
time in their fight for survival.
And he revealed that it could come down to winning the play-offs to
avoid the #4m loss and damage which relegation would bring to the club
for the first time in their history.
Aitken, though, remained positive about the future -- even though his
side could hit rock-bottom in the league tonight if Partick Thistle beat
Hearts at Firhill.
He insisted: ''I know time is against us but there are still six games
left. There is enough time to save us if we get the right results.
''I am realistic enough to know that we now have a major task on our
hands. Those six games will be very, very difficult -- especially as the
next one is against Rangers.
''If it goes to the last game or the play-offs, so be it. We will
handle that if and when it happens.
''In recent games we have had a problem scoring goals. We should have
had more. But we have been peppering the opposition goals and creating
numerous chances only to come up against keepers in international form.
The breaks haven't been going for us, either.
''I am a great believer that if you play well, you'll win three out of
four games. This hasn't happened so far for us.
''But the players have shown a lot of character lately. They have
regained the consistency in their play which was lacking earlier in the
season.
''They are totally committed on and off the park. I could not ask for
more -- except results. They know what is at stake and are sacrificing
themselves to get them.
''I have stressed to them, though, that if they maintain the playing
standards expected at this club, results will come.
''It will not be lack of effort or determination which lets us down.
If they continue performing on this level, I am certain they will pick
up enough points and get us out of trouble.''

<HEADLINE>Good news on rugby front. About-turn puts Tonga match back on screen</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>34</PAGE>

ARMCHAIR rugby enthusiasts in the central belt will be able to see all
of Scotland's Rugby World Cup games live following a decision by
Scottish Television to clear their schedules for the crucial first-round
match against Tonga which the ITV network was to screen only in
highlight form.
Grampian, serving the Highlands and the north-east, and Carlisle-based
Border, transmitting to the south of Scotland, are still negotiating
air-time but the indications are that they may follow the lead shown by
Scottish.
A plea by Scotland captain Gavin Hastings that the game be screened
live to Scottish rugby followers was highlighted in The Herald at the
weekend. He declared that there would be thousands of disappointed fans
if the team's performance was not beamed live from South Africa.
ITV is spending #8m on its coverage of the World Cup which runs from
May 25 to June 24. In the schedule revealed last week only the Scotland
v Tonga game, which takes place on the evening of May 30, was not being
screened live.
All of the other games involving the Home Unions, including Scotland's
other two first-round games against Ivory Coast and France, are to be
shown live.
Only the Scottish encounter with Tonga was being recorded for later
transmission in highlight form. ITV claimed there were scheduling
problems with live coverage but the following evening, when Wales play
New Zealand with the same kick-off time as the Tonga game, even the
top-rated soap opera Coronation Street was being moved to allow for
uninterrupted coverage.
Yesterday Hastings said: ''That's tremendous news and entirely
justified. A lot of Scottish rugby fans would have been bitterly
disappointed if they had been allowed to see only recorded highlights.
The public were desperate to see Scotland in action in the World Cup
after the way that they have played this year.''
''I know from the likes of the squad session at Perth this weekend
just how much support we have. There were hundreds of children there
clamouring for autographs and that was just an indication of how much
interest there is in rugby in Scotland these days.''
Scottish's director of broadcasting Blair Jenkins said: ''Whatever is
happening elsewhere in the UK, Scottish has sovereignty over its own
air-time and we are very aware of what our viewers want to see. We are
delighted to be able to cover all three group matches live and, indeed,
we hope to be following Scotland all the way to the final.''
''Coverage of the Tonga match will, of course, be made available to
viewers in Grampian and Border if their local stations wish to take
it.''
Scottish Rugby Union secretary Bill Hogg was delighted at the
initiative shown by Scottish: ''I know that when the schedules came from
London, Scottish, like us, were very upset that the Tonga game was not
being shown live but they were always keen to show it and now they have
taken the appropriate action. Followers of Scottish rugby will be
absolutely delighted.''
A spokesman for Grampian said that discussions were continuing in an
effort to guarantee live transmission. ''We welcome the fact that
Scottish are taking the game and negotiations are going on over the
possibility of us taking it too.''
In Carlisle, from which Border transmits to the heartland of Scottish
rugby, a spokesman said: ''We are currently talking to Scottish about
this and our director of broadcasting, Cath Worrall, will make a
decision in the next day or two.''
* SCOTLAND A's tour to Zimbabwe, which takes place at the same time as
the World Cup in South Africa, has been cut from five matches to four.
The change has been made following pressure from Zimbabwe, who felt
that the team for the fifth match would be made up of players who had
already faced the tourists. The Zimbabwe Union was also worried that the
attendance at a fifth game, could be affected by televison coverage of
the World Cup. The new tour itinerary is:
Wednesday, May 31 v Country Districts, in Banket; Saturday, June 3 v
Zimbabwe, in Bulawayo; Wednesday, June 7 v Zimbabwe A, in Mutare;
Saturday, June 10 v Zimbabwe, in Harare.
The 26-strong squad, which will be coached by David Johnston and Hugh
Campbell and managed by Arthur Hastie, will be announced on Friday one
day after Scotland's World Cup party is made known.
* THE Italian Zebras have named a star-studded squad for the Hawick
seven-a-side tournament which takes place at Mansfield Park on April 15.
The 10 squad members boast 104 caps between them, headed by the 32-times
capped Stefano Barba and Bonomi Massimo, who has played 28 times for the
Italian national side. Five of the Italians played in the World Sevens
tournament at Murrayfield in 1993.
The other guest sides for the tournament are the 1994 winners, the
Pringle President's XII, which includes Andy Nicol and Mark Appleson in
their line-up, Ulster and West Hartlepool, which includes Australian Jim
Williams, who was a member of the Wallaby seven at the Hong Kong sevens
10 days ago.
The draw is to be made on Monday and yesterday Hawick secretary John
Thorburn said that the Italian Zebra side were liable to provide some
sparkling rugby. ''They will certainly be the strongest side on the
sevens' circuit this year,'' he added. Italian Zebras:
Leonardo Perziano, Ryan Wheeler, Piermassimiliano Dott, Walter
Cristofoletti, Bonomi Massimo, Julian Gardner, Ivan Francescato, Stefano
Barba, Michelangelo Amore, Stefano Bordon.

THE Stock Exchange is considering imposing tighter rules on
market-makers about disclosure of share stakes they may hold.
The move follows the controversial use of derivatives by Swiss Bank
Corporation in Trafalgar House's bid for Northern Electric which led to
Swiss Bank's market makers buying shares in Northern.
Market-makers are currently exempt from the rule that a stake of 3% of
more acquired in a company has to be disclosed because they can hold
this proportion or more at times during their normal course of business.
However, the Stock Exchange said this can enable them to acquire a
strategic stake in a company with a view to selling it to a predator.
Such holdings, the Exchange believes, should not be exempt from
disclosure.
Companies should have the right to be informed on a confidential basis
of all significant holdings of their shares and the prices paid for them
and it has issued a consultative document on the subject of
market-makers' holdings.
The Exchange intends to monitor closely where a market-maker's
position in a particular share rises substantially and will seek
explanations where these holdings are unusual for that market-maker or
when they are out of line with positions held by the market generally.
With other regulators such as the Takeover Panel, the Exchange is
considering changes in the rules following Swiss Bank's derivative
transactions.

NHS manager,
THESE are challenging times for any NHS trust, but Heather McVey
thrives on challenge. That is one reason why she has developed a
secretarial career into one which has taken her to a management and
administrative position, handling sensitive matters and being involved
in high-level decisions.
Heather works on behalf of the Community and Mental Health Services
NHS Trust, administering a project under which Glasgow's Gartloch
Hospital is being closed, with the needs of its patients adequately
catered for in new surroundings.
She sees this latter part of her job as a positive contribution to the
welfare not only of the hospital's patients but also of their relatives,
all of whose needs have to be considered.
Heather takes an active part in instigated consultation and advice
programmes which might be viewed as above and beyond her call of duty.
The job gives her that freedom and she enjoys the responsibility.
She decided some years ago that she needed something more challenging.
She had trained as a secretary at Cardonald College before taking
various jobs, and then decided she would require more qualifications if
she were to aspire to management level.
So, three years ago, she enrolled as a night-school student at the
city's Central College of Commerce, emerging with an HND in Business
Administration. As luck would have it she had already secured her
present position but the extra qualification has done no harm and she
hopes to go on and take a degree.
Life, meanwhile, is a hectic round of meetings, consultations with
relatives, liaising on the arrangements for the closure, and reporting
to the multi-agency committees responsible for the physical re-provision
for the patients.
Purpose-built units are being provided in various parts of the east
sector of Glasgow and Heather is still involved in finding new sites.
The re-provision for the patients is expected to include one NHS
establishment with 72 beds and two specialised nursing homes with a
further 120.
Sixty more places are being found in other types of accommodation
providing the necessary support, and a great deal of work is being done
on ensuring the provision of resource centres in the community, day
hospital facilities, day-care support, community psychiatric nursing,
and a range of social care support.
Heather McVey's administrative tasks mean she often does extra work at
home on her PC. She and her staff are in constant touch with relatives
and staff, through written reports and face-to-face contacts, and she
produces monthly reports for both.
And she has been helping organise events to commemorate 100 years of
the hospital, such as a karaoke challenge, summer gala, celebrity soccer
match, a tea dance for patients, and a pantomime.
Recently she managed to get a history of Gartloch Hospital into print,
and in July she is mounting an exhibition on the hospital's story at
Kelvingrove Art Gallery.
Communicating with staff and patients' relatives is possibly her main
task at the moment. Recently she was responsible for two initiatives
specifically aimed at helping the patients, and established through a
trust fund which was left to the hospital for patient welfare. One is an
advocacy project providing a forum for the patients to put their
viewpoint across: the other a befriending scheme for the patients,
starts this month.
Does she enjoy her job? ''Very much,'' she says. ''It is a positive
chance to help people adapt to change, and I am involved in a variety of
other trust projects as well as the one at Gartloch.
''I am confident my career has now moved in the right direction.''

<HEADLINE>Prices pushed higher by sterling weakness</HEADLINE>

THE upward pressure on prices intensified last month, in part because
of the weakness of sterling, according to the latest Purchasing
Managers' survey.
Manufacturing experienced strong growth, but at a slightly slower pace
than in February, and a fifth of all companies took on extra staff to
help them cope with demand.
The Purchasing Managers' prices index rose from 73.2% in February to
75%, its second highest level. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply, which conducts the survey, found that more than half of
purchasing managers reported a further rise in the price of materials,
fuels, and semi-manufactures.
The three main factors influencing pressure on input prices were the
weakness of sterling, which led to higher import prices, increased alloy
surcharges, and supply problems.
A wide variety of plastics, chemicals, papers, and metals were
affected. Aluminium rose for the fifteenth sucessive month, and some
buyers faced increases of up to 15%.
The seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index dropped from 56.8%
in February to 55.7%, indicated a slight slowdown from a hectic pace of
activity. According to this index manufacturing has been expanding for
28 months in a row.
The indices measuring new orders, output, and employment all fell back
a little, but capacity constraints increased.
The institute's director general, Peter Thomson, said: ''As many as
one in five of our purchasing managers reported taking on extra staff in
March. In spite of this manufacturers are still having problems meeting
sales levels and delivering goods on time.''
Meanwhile, an unexpectedly large jump in the narrow measure of the
money supply failed to upset financial markets.
M0 rose by 1.1% between February and March and the annual rate of
increase shot up from 6.2% to 7%, but the bulk of the rise was down to
bankers' balances which rose sharply ahead of Easter.
The main constituent of M0, notes and coins in circulation, increased
by 0.5%, and the annual rate retreated from 6.1% to 5.9%.
There was nothing in the money supply figures to persuade the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George, that another rise in interest rates was
needed this month when they meet tomorrow.
The Purchasing Managers' survey pointed to the persistance of input
price inflation, but the authorities are expected to wait for another
month at least before pushing up rates for the fourth time since
September.
By then the next quarterly CBI trends survey, which is closely
monitored by the Bank of England, will have been published. Meantime,
recent signs of a slowdown in economic activity are likely to outweigh
concerns about the damage being done by sterling's weakness.

Kay Aschaber reports on moves to combine theory and practice in the
hotel trade.
EMPLOYERS' demands on academic qualifications are increasing
dramatically in the service sector, but learning how to sack someone is
a far cry from textbook theory.
Although no graduate ever wants to have to deal with such a task, it
is important that managers of the future can deal with the people and
not simply the logistics of their position.
One profession that has had to deal with the academic versus practical
conundrum in recent years is the hotel and catering sector. Today there
is a greater emphasis on academic qualifications for supervisory and
management posts, while ensuring that the most important aspect of the
practical work -- customer contact -- excels certified grades.
It is a subject close to the heart of Christopher Rawstron, operations
manager of the Forte Crest at Glasgow Airport, who has set a live
project for five undergraduates taking the degree course at the
University of Strathclyde Hotel School in an attempt to provide that
catalyst of experience which allows theory and practice to gel.
A graduate of the course himself, Christopher has nothing but praise
for the hotel school, which this year celebrates its 50th anniversary.
However he maintains: ''The one thing all students of hotel and catering
lack is people management.''
What better cure than the reality of work? He continued: ''The theory
I learned at university needed the practical side -- real situations --
to complete the picture. It's just like passing your driving test --
that's only the start of the learning process.''
Having been through the mill himself, Christopher is keen to see
industry and education close ranks to benefit the employer and the
potential employee.
As well as taking an active part in the hotel school's course review
committee, which seeks the industrialist's viewpoint on the current
syllabus of the course, he is constantly looking at ways to inject more
of the practical reality of the job into the learning curve of the hotel
school's students. The aim is to prepare them more effectively for the
working environment.
By giving these fourth-year students the opportunity to carry out a
feasibility study into the development of a leisure club in the hotel,
he is hoping that they will learn more about the degree of diplomacy and
integrity required for the job.
Although the motivation behind the hotel school degree course is the
academic qualifications, practical assignments such as this are greatly
valued by the students.
Colin Convery, one of the undergraduates taking part in the Forte
Crest project, recognises the need to demolish the barriers that often
face students venturing into full-time employment. He commented: ''One
of the benefits of this particular university course is that you're
forced into doing the practical experience -- whether you like it or
not.''

MORPHOLOGY is an exact science. So too is the music of composer Chick
Lyall, which made up the bulk of Sunday night's concert. However, we are
not concerned here with the science of the structure of organisms (I
don't think), but rather with the harnessing of the nom de guerre of
funky jazz guitarist Morph to a bop-esque suffix.
In composing a suite of new material for his new fivesome, Lyall has
dedicated some of the tunes to the musicians he has been working with --
but only when they make proper words, which kind of sums up Lyall's
fastidious approach. Thus we get Philology (for saxophonist Bancroft),
but no Iainology or Johnology for the rhythm section.
Lyall writes meticulously structured music. His melodies are things of
exquisite beauty and his grooves derive from adventurous use of time
signatures. Sometimes this can leave little room for these musicians to
do what they do best -- that Morphology opener seemed a very subdued
interpretation of the guitarist's musical personality -- but you don't
keep a player like Bancroft in a straitjacket very long. After tearing
through Morph's Mike It Up in best Brecker mode, he let loose over the
full range of the horn on Philology, a solo made all the better by its
contrast with the controlled precision of Lyall's preceding one on
synthesiser.
In fact Lyall's own soloing is firmly rooted in blues for all his
classical training, but Ballad for Tom (for Bancroft's drummer brother,
who's not in the band) and the complex Ambush display the technical
expertise he brings to his work. An attentive audience in Basement
Jazz's new home appreciated every note.

Glasgow is to host a
major international conference that will forge closer links between
industry and education.
High-powered speakers from America, Australia, and Britain will
address the 400 delegates expected to attend the International Education
Business Partnership conference at the Glasgow Hilton April 26-29.
''The partnership theme of the conference is of paramount
importance,'' said Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman of Macfarlane
(Clansmen) plc and United Distillers.
''Economic regeneration depends on people, their drive, determination,
and skills development -- all essential ingredients to the future
wellbeing of Scotland and economies throughout the world.''
Russel Griggs of Scottish Enterprise, one of the sponsors of the
conference, said: ''The repercussions of this conference could be
far-reaching. I am convinced it will lead to closer liaison and
co-operation between industry and education, and that can only benefit
the Scottish economy and the performance of Scottish companies.''
''The calibre of the speakers who readily agreed to address this
conference reflects the high profile they attach to the partnership
issue,'' said organising committee chairman Alex Blackwood.
''Scotland's decision to host this prestigious conference was rewarded
at the EBP event in Washington last year when the international board
approved Glasgow as the location for the 1995 event.''
The themes of the three-day conference will focus on enterprise,
education, and entrepreneurship; building tomorrow's workforce through
skills development; and progress through partnership.
The Hon David Sieff, director of corporate and external affairs at
Marks and Spencer; Steve Marrioti, president of the US National
Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship; and Frank Pignatelli,
Strathclyde's director of education, will talk about enterprise,
education, and entrepreneurship.
Progress through partnership will be addressed by Bill Furness,
national manager for Scotland of British Telecom; Connie Spinner, policy
manager of the US Public Education Fund Network; and Alasdair Nicol,
managing director of Carbo Plastics of Dunbartonshire.
Professor John Ward, director of IBM (UK) Ltd and chairman of the
Advisory Scottish Council for Education and Training Targets, and Fraser
Morrison, chairman of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, will highlight
building tomorrow's workforce through skills development.

HIGHLAND Distilleries' shares crashed 26p to 357p after a mere 1% rise
in half time pre-tax profits to #23.7m after the market reflected
disappointment with the apparent slowdown in export growth and continued
depression in the prospects for sale of fillings.
However, that shrouds the good news in the domestic market where sales
of Famous Grouse rose 6% by volume in the UK in the six months to
February compared with 4% by the re-launched Bell's 8 Year Old in
approximately the same period.
Industry volume in the period improved 2%. That does contain an
element of advance buying ahead of the duty increase imposed as from the
beginning of the year but does emphasise there is a market for premium
spirits even if the supermarket own-label brands continue to make
advances.
Overall UK market share eased from 13.8% to 13.5% with the Scottish
off-trade or take-home sector suffering most because of multi-buy
discounts from some competitors. In contrast, Scottish bar trade
improved further to 31.2% and overall UK to 29.7%.
Chairman John Goodwin strongly defended the importance of supporting
brands yesterday. Highland is raising its overall promotional spend by a
quarter this year including around #2m on the Rugby World Cup in South
Africa.
Famous Grouse prices were raised 2% last year and by 3[1/2]% earlier
in 1995 so that it maintains a clear price differential overboth Bell's
and Teacher's. The brand raised its profits contribution by #600,000
while fillings fell by #500,000 or 20%.
That reflected the continued pressure on malt margins with the sector
still not in balance and with stability probably at least a year off.
The industry would seem in a state where there shuld be some
self-discipline imposed although, as usual, pride can take precedence
over prudence with stocks at a still unhealthy 7[1/2] years' sales.
Highland will be introducing a new non-scotch premium spirit product
later this year which will be sold internationally through the one sixth
owned Remy Cointreau distribution network which now handles 55% of group
whisky sales overseas -- but the details are being kept under wraps at
present.
Exports improved 5% which were below best hopes thanks to expected
dullness in Japan and echoing Guinness, UK duty-free saw the Calais
effect hitting ferry sales although overall shipments in the sort term
to France are under some pressure due to de-stocking by Remy.
However, there have been useful market share gains in high growth
areas such as Thailand and Greece although profits have been soaked up
in the promotional efforts in European and Far Eastern markets.
Cash generation remained strong and Highland should remain the year
with a sizable surplus -- some #19.5m was spent in maintaining the
proportional stake in the Orpar holding company which is the vehicle
that controls Remy Cointreau as well as a direct investment in the
cognac, champagne and liqueur company.
The interim dividend has been raised by 8% to 1.9p. Given that full
year profits should improve from #42.5m to about #44m which would leave
the shares trading at 15[1/2] times likely earnings.
The yield on the probable 8p dividend total is 2.2% and the shares
seem set to slumber this summer until the new product is introduced to
generate excitement.

Sara Villiers reports on a version of Macbeth which challenges the
standard Shakespearean version and concentrates instead on the cult of
the hero
FORGET the Scottish play and listen up for the Gaelic and Doric
account. The Invisible Bouncers Theatre Company, who produced the
acclaimed mixed-language production The Aipple Tree last year in
collaboration with Drama na-h Alba, are out to reclaim the demonised
Macbeth from the hands of the English bard with a production which
stresses the heroic aspects of the Scottish king.
An Gaisgeach/The Hero focuses on the peace and prosperity of Macbeth's
17-year reign over eleventh-century Scotland and aims to celebrate the
abstract theme of the hero in the Scottish soul through a personal
examination of this legendary figure. ''The production is based on the
few facts that we know about him as opposed to the dastardly monster
portrayed in Shakespeare's masterpiece,'' director Alastair McDonald
wryly explains.
Thus, Macbeth's greatest internal dilemma is reconciling idealistic
fervour with a keen survival instinct, and Duncan -- ''who at 23 was
actually much younger than Macbeth and was really a right toerag, we're
playing him as a Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves Sheriff of Nottingham
type,'' says McDonald -- is killed reluctantly and only on the
entreaties of other Scottish noblemen.
Since successfully staging The Aipple Tree, which was set on an oil
rig, Invisible Bouncers had been looking for another project which could
provide a suitable platform for a Gaelic-Doric fusion. The struggle of
the Moray-based Macbeth to bridge the Pagan and Catholic faiths and his
endeavour to achieve union in Scotland suggested itself as appropriate
and also perfect for the kind of epic theatre the company favours; the
production is played out in a 60-foot space, cornered by enormous
pillars and with Scotland mapped out as a giant chessboard.
McDonald's approach has been idiosyncratic; the company's exploration
of Macbeth's heroism has been fuelled by intensive workshops in personal
psychological quests. ''We've followed the principles of the American
mythologist Joseph Campbell and gone on a 'Hero's Journey','' explains
McDonald.
''It's about having a call to adventure and trying to achieve a
personal miracle, which at first seems impossible. You clarify your
heroic and demonic qualities and then balance these through
confrontation and enter the Land of Miracles, where you go through your
supreme ordeal, which is usually interpreted as facing up to death, then
you get your Reward and take it back to your community, which will be
enriched by it. Our miracles are all different, Macbeth's just happened
to be peace and unity in Scotland.''
Okay-dokey, so what's your miracle, Alastair? Slumped in post
last-night-at-Aberdeen-performance-party-hangover-mode, he flippantly
replies ''to get through the rest of the day'', but reconsiders. ''It's
to try and continue the process of ensuring there is a cultural
renaissance in Scotland. The arts can make very brave statements about
our nationhood.''
While the Hero's Journey principle might sound like a New Age vagary,
McDonald insists it has immense practical applications and advantages.
''The process opened up a new way of exploring performances and was an
incredibly quick route into the very soul of the characters.
Consequently, we created a stronger company in two days than we normally
could in six weeks.''
He takes the cast through a mini-Hero's Journey before every show,
although he points out that while this understanding enriches the
performances, it is subliminal to the plot. What it does mean though is
that there are no super-heroes or super villains. ''A villain is just
someone with his demon in ascendancy,'' he shrugs.
And quite categorically Lady Macbeth is no villainess. In An Gaisgeach
Macbeth's wife Gruach is no manipulative besom but has in fact been much
abused. Raped at 15 by Gillacomain, who then marries her when she was
16, she is later effectively rescued by Macbeth who slays Gillacomain in
revenge for the murder of his parents 12 years earlier.
''The death of his parents is Macbeth's call to adventure,'' explains
McDonald. ''After that both his hero and his demon are in ascendancy,
unleashing revenge and bloodlust.''
He has been careful about the portrayal of this bloodlust, fed up with
the increasing prevalence of gratituitous violence on stage and scene.
The fight scenes have been choreographed by Pat Davies, an expert in Tae
Kwon Do. The result is very stylised sequences which McDonald was happy
to let his young sons view. ''In fact, my youngest son complained there
wasn't enough blood and violence,'' he says ruefully.
The depiction of violence, and sex, is still powerful however. ''I
think our rehearsal processes have allowed us to get rid of the
traditional sexuality of the groin,'' he continues. ''The sexuality of
the cast comes from the waist up. We've tried to create a pyramid of
light; it starts at the stomach, the animal instinct, goes up to the
heart, the emotion, and then the head, the logic, and the top of the
pyramid should be at just above the head, where the spirit hovers.''
The play is the first in a planned trilogy by Invisible Bouncers
Theatre Company. They hope to tour The '45, an examination of Culloden,
next year, to be followed by a project which stresses McDonald's point
that real unity in Scotland will be achieved through a renaissance of
its culture. ''Change will come through culture rather than politics,''
he insists.
* An Gaisgeach/The Hero is at the Tramway, Glasgow, tonight and runs
till Saturday April 8, then transfers to Edinburgh's Assembly Rooms from
April 11-15.

IN EUROPEAN competitions, clubs are restricted by the
''three-foreigner rule''. This means that the squad listed to play can
include no more than three non-nationals.
The minor exception to this is that a club can list two assimilated
players in addition to the three foreigners. In essence, assimilated
players are non-nationals who have played youth-team football for a
number of years in the country where they are playing senior football.
One of the best-known examples of this is Ryan Giggs, who is a Welshman
in reality but counts as an Englishman for the purposes of European club
competitions.
The three-foreigner rule is contrary to European law -- of that, there
is no doubt. It restricts the free movement of labour, which is one of
the main aims of EC rules.
This rule exists because of an agreement between UEFA and the EC
Commission. UEFA persuaded the Commission that football should be
treated as a special case, and as a result the Commission condoned a
breach of EC law. This agreement will run out at the end of season
1995-96, although I have no doubt that UEFA hopes to extend it beyond
that date.
Those who favour the rule argue that it protects the domestic game,
prevents richer clubs buying the best available players, and encourages
the development of youth policies to bring on home-grown players.
I believe this is naive, unrealistic, and certainly contrary to the
best interests of Scottish football and Scottish clubs.
Football cannot afford to be parochial or inward-looking. Football has
no right to expect people to come and support it unless it offers the
right product in the right facilities. Football is part of the
entertainment and leisure industry, and we must realise this.
Supporters want their teams to be successful domestically -- and in
Europe -- especially in Europe. In recent years Rangers have had very
limited success in Europe and one of the main reasons for this has been
our inability to play our best players. If we were to play a European
tie tonight we have available Trevor Steven, Basile Boli, Mark Hateley,
Brian Laudrup, Alexei Mikhailichenko, and Craig Moore. Only three of
those could play.
In effect, we are being forced to cheat our supporters, who pay their
money to see our best team, our best product. The manager cannot provide
this.
Scotland is particularly vulnerable. Our available player pool is tiny
compared with England, Holland, France, Germany, Italy, etc. Even with
three world-class foreigners and the best Scots available, a Scottish
team will struggle at European level. This is a fact of football life.
In order to be successful, we need to shop in the open market.
This does not mean to say I am against Scots players. Far from it. In
an ideal world, I would want Rangers to win the European Cup fielding an
all-Scots, home-grown side. It will never happen.
There is a long tradition of foreign players in our game and it is to
the benefit of our game. Laudrup and Mikhailichenko bring money into our
game, they create interest in our game, and youngsters can only benefit
from playing alongside such talents. Who better for a young professional
to model himself on than Mark Hateley?
Clubs at all levels need to cast the net wider. There are players of
all nationalities and all levels of ability who could benefit our game.
If Scots players are good enough, they can play anywhere. Football is
the one truly worldwide game. Supporters want to see the best players,
regardless of their nationality. Indeed, nationality is as irrelevant as
skin colour.
If the rule is abolished, will it mean that the biggest clubs will buy
the best players? Probably -- so what is new? I do not remember seeing
Romario, Hagi, or van Basten play for Hearts, Hibs, QPR, or Leicester
City. Clubs must bring on young players and sign the best players they
can afford. This is what supporters want -- and they are right.
I accept that the UK is in an unusual position. Or citizens are all
British yet we have four nationalities in football terms. It could be
argued that British players should be regarded as such in European
competitions, and not be in any sense regarded as foreigners. The home
associations fear that this would lead to the call for a British
international team in the World Cup and European Championship.
I do not argue for this approach. It is an unacceptable
non-compromise. The three-foreigner rule should go.
The last time I campaigned for its abolition, a number of clubs lent
their moral support. None was prepared to fund a challenge through the
European Court nor were they prepared to stick their heads above the
parapet.
There is a fear that clubs could be suspended from European
competitions if they take UEFA to court. This could happen under UEFA
rules. Is it seriously to be suggested that, if the top European clubs
got together, UEFA would tarnish its own competitions by banning them en
masse?
Again Rangers will take the lead. I know that Manchester United share
our views. There is also support from other leading European clubs. I
believe we must get together soon. Pressure must be brought to bear on
UEFA from all fronts. The three-foreigner rule must not be extended
beyond 1995-96.
If UEFA and the Commission do not accept this, I have no doubt that a
case must be taken before the European Court.
This need not be brought by a club but can be brought by a
shareholder, season-ticket holder, director, player, players' agent --
the list is endless.
I have no doubt that the rule will go -- it must go.
I want the best for Rangers -- and Scottish football as a whole. I
want to see the best players playing in Scotland, and I want our clubs
to be successful in Europe. I have heard no argument to convince me that
we can achieve this so long as the rule exists. We have been forced to
short-change our supporters long enough -- and for Rangers, enough is
enough.
If we cannot offer people the best product and compete successfully at
the highest level, the future of our game is bleak. We will become a
parochial back-water. That may be acceptable to some -- not to Rangers.
Our commitment to Scottish football is absolute -- but real success
will be measured by our results against the best in Europe. Only once
the playing field is level will our clubs have the chance of achieving
what our supporters rightly demand.

The communication that helps build relationships between the new
councils and the people they serve, is examined by Deirdre Hutton.
THE evidence from the Scottish Consumer Council's consumer network
volunteers is that ordinary people are getting worried about local
government reform and whether the services they need will still be
available.
It is hardly surprising that this anxiety is emerging because, viewed
from the outside, the agenda looks remote from the lives of ordinary
people.
We have heard about geography, jobs, and councillors, but really very
little about the needs of users.
The political debate so far has left many vulnerable consumers
wondering whether the services they rely on are going to continue, and a
high priority for local government should be to reassure its users and
to make the change as seamless as possible.
There have been some excellent initiatives in local government
recently, and these must not be lost in the melee of change. Equally, it
would be a wasted opportunity if there was a rush to recreate exactly
what exists now.
Few would claim that local government is already perfect, so this
reform must be seen as an opportunity to look critically at what is
already provided with a simple rule of thumb. Identify what is good and
make sure it is retained, abandon what is not good, and strive to create
what is missing.
If this is to be done effectively it must be centred on the
perceptions of users. What services do people actually want, where do
they want them, and how do they want them delivered?
These are the questions that should be uppermost in the minds of
councillors and officials, and it is the information arising out of
these questions that should be used to drive the design of services in
the new councils.
Behind the design of services lies another fundamental question. Is
the current organisation of local government, with its vertical
separation into the different fiefdoms of housing, education, transport,
and so on, effective in underpinning the needs of users?
A glance at the real lives of the vulnerable people who depend on
local government services shows that their problems are inter-related
and they need help that is integrated if it is to be effective.
It is unreasonable to expect ordinary people to cope with the
disparate organisational structures of local government. They are
already the less powerful in the relationship with the council, and it
should be up to the professionals to arrange their organisation around
the needs or people, not the other way around.
Consumer Network was established in 1986 to help the SCC keep in touch
with consumer concerns at local level. Around 70 volunteers from all
over Scotland provide important information about local consumer issues
which are of concern to them or to other people living in their area.
This suggests a need for greatly enhanced co-operation between
departments, perhaps with more horizontal cabinet-style governance at
the top, with the vertical divisions starting lower down the scale. Are
there better ways of organising departments, perhaps around issues
rather than disciplines? A department for young people?
Finally, local government must harness the opportunities of the
information superhighway to create the effective information systems
that could underpin the relationship between local government and its
community.
Systems that will inform people about what services they can expect,
where they can get them, to what standard, and how they can complain to
get redress if things go wrong.
But the information system must be two-way, so that people can equally
inform councillors and officials about their needs and expectations, and
so that both sides can build up a dialogue which is based on open
accessible relationships.
The message is really very simple. Local government must put the users
of services first, middle, and last if it is to be truly effective.

The concept of gender comes under attack in a Venus and Adonis
illuminated by rape, bondage, and Irish dancing. Sara Villiers explains
IT has been compared to Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, made one
critic's ''juices weep'', inspired the headline ''Lynn Play Sex Shock'',
includes bondage, rape scenes and much snorting of cocaine and, with all
of this and some pretty strong language too, is deemed definitely
unsuitable for the under-16s. Who says Shakespeare isn't alive and
kicking?
Venus and Adonis is coming to town and taking no prisoners. The Actors
Touring Company's version of the Bard's erotically charged narrative
poem has been blowing audiences away as it tours around the country,
thrilling them with its sensational portrayal of the goddess of love as
a slave to lust, raddled by her passion for her reluctant lover.
The production, which opens at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow tonight,
represents a collaboration between ATC -- who specialise in updating
European classics -- and physical theatre group The Hairy Marys. Three
Hairy Marys perform, although the only hirsute one is Susan Swanton, who
plays Adonis with a rakishly thin pencil-moustache. S/he is tormented by
Carmelle McAree as the young obsessed Venus, while Ona McCracken plays
the older Venus, narrating on a video monitor.
The award-winning Stewart Laing, who designed Scottish Opera's Fidelio
and The Father for the Citizens, has created a pop culture set, with the
cast making exits and entrances via an oversized television set, while
director Nick Philippou has sliced up the 1200-line poem and diced it
with video images, uproarious comedy, and dynamic snatches of music,
ranging from PJ Harvey to Philip Glass, and taking in Dusty
Springfield's You Don't Have to Say You Love Me en route.
Venus and Adonis represents a new direction for The Hairy Marys who
have previously made their name with devised pieces, such as last year's
Skirting the Issue and the winningly titled Nun in the Coven, but their
company policy -- a dedication to gender-challenging work -- is very
much in tune with Philippou's radical approach.
''Nick knew Sian Stevenson, our artistic director, came to our shows
and thought we would be suitable for this project,'' explains Carmelle
McAree. ''It was quite daunting. We had heard of Venus and Adonis but
had never read it -- but we were excited about doing a text-based work,
and there is still a lot of physical movement in the show.''
That movement includes The Hairy Mary trademark Irish dancing. The
North London-based group evolved from a shared background in Irish
dancing, and were ambitious to explore and develop its physical and
theatrical potential. Beginning on the cabaret scene, with a defiantly
feminist act which poked fun at male stereotypes, they developed a
distinctive performance style, creating themed shows exploring female
sexuality.
The character of Venus offers particularly rich scope. ''I love
playing her, she's so chameleon like,'' agrees McAree. ''Throughout the
show I constantly change hair colour and outfits, trying to be like
Madonna or an Italian mother, anything to get Adonis's attention. But
alongside that desperation to please is the power she has. After all,
she is the goddess of love and she's physically stronger than Adonis.''
That superior strength manifests itself in a bondage and rape scene,
with Venus ravishing the young Adonis, which caused consternation in
King's Lynn with local clergy blasting the production -- ignoring the
fact that the rape is in Shakespeare's raunchy poem. ''Some audiences
might be surprised but I shouldn't think anyone who has seen The Hairy
Marys before would be shocked,'' says McAree.
Used to taking the mickey out of men, the Hairy Marys have enjoyed the
different angle to Venus and Adonis. ''It really shows the good and bad
sides of men and women and having Susan playing Adonis emphasies the
feminine aspects of his character. You see men in drag in a lot of stage
but you don't see much cross-dressing the other way around.''
Whether in leathers or lace, the performers have been dressed by hip
clothes store Red Or Dead, although McAree admits that this has been
minimal in her case: ''I'm in my underwear for much of the show.''

A NEW grant of #600 a hectare is to be paid to landowners, over and
above existing grants, to encourage tree planting as part of the Central
Scotland Woodland Initiative.
Announcing details yesterday, Sir Peter Hutchison, chairman of the
Forestry Commission, said that the Flat Rate Locational Supplement would
be available for the next three years.
It will be targeted at the central plateau area of the Woodland
Initiative which stretches from Kirkintilloch to Livingston. Coverage
includes the land around Airdrie, Shotts, Harthill, Livingston and
Bathgate.
The supplement will be paid for plantings of between 10 and 25
hectares on top of existing grants which range from #1350 a hectare for
small broad-leaved woods to #700 for conifers.
Sir Peter was speaking at the launch of the Central Scotland Forest
Strategy which is aimed at transforming the landscape between Glasgow
and Edinburgh. The strategy covers 620 square miles of central Scotland
and will be implemented by the Central Scotland Countryside Trust.
The trust's chief executive, Dr Campbell Gemmell, said that much of
the area was scarred by past industrial activity. Their aim was to
double woodland cover in the next 20 years. To achieve this target
planting would have to take place on farmland, publicly-owned land and
through private forestry development. With farming accounting for 65% of
the land use in the area more effort would be required to promote
forestry as an integral part of farm businesses.
It was also hoped that economic regeneration would flow from the
stimulation of the region's forestry, wood processing and tourism
industries.
Scottish Natural Heritage is backing the forest plan with an annual
grant of #850,000 which will be used for land purchases, restructuring
of the land holding and general implementation of the strategy. Chairman
Magnus Magnusson recalled that the project had been described as
ambitious when it was first mooted in 1989.
''Now, in 1995, armed with hindsight and experience we all recognise
the enormity of the task which has been proposed,'' he said. Vast tracts
of central Scotland were very run down with derelict industrial areas
which would benefit from tree planting he said.
''Natural heritage is everwhere -- it starts in our own back yard,''
he said. ''The central Scotland area is the back yard for the
overwhelming majority of people in Scotland.''
Mr Guy Watt, a partner in rural surveyors John Clegg &amp; Co, said that
the private sector would have a key part to play in the creation of the
central Scotland forest. He estimated that 85% of the land in the area
was privately owned and 65% in agricultural use. The attitude of some
900 farmers towards further tree planing would be critical. The new
locational supplement would, he hoped, make forestry a viable option.

SCOTTISH companies lined up an estimated #8.2m worth of business
during a recent week-long trade mission to Hong Kong led by Lord Younger
of Prestwick, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The presence of Lord Younger, who is president of The Scottish Council
Development and Industry, raised the profile of the annual SCDI mission.
With the Hong Kong market providing a wealth of business
opportunities, the 23 participating companies were drawn from a wide
variety of sectors.
They ranged from soup company Baxter's of Speyside to Brunton's of
Musselburgh, which produces steel wire ropes for the construction
sector.
During and immediately after the visit in January, more than #1m worth
of orders were placed.
Visiting companies anticipate that the value of business generated by
the trip will rise to about #8.2m in the near to medium term.
Scottish exports to Hong Kong increased by 70% over a two-year period
to total #156m in the year to end-March 1994.
With the British colony bracing itself for the hand-over to China in
1997, those on the mission saw no signs of diminishing enthusiasm for
business.
SCDI trade development executive Iain McTaggart said: ''The feeling is
that Hong Kong will very much remain a gateway to China, once it becomes
part of China. Few people believe the Chinese would, in the near future,
do anything to undermine that.''
Scottish companies have a good track record in Hong Kong, which
remains the hub of the world's fastest-growing region.

DOUGLAS Fairbairn, who wrote for The Herald for 13 years, is to head
up accountancy major Ernst &amp; Young's UK tax practice. Mr Fairbairn, who
has been managing partner of the firm's Glasgow office for the last five
years, will take up the London-based post of national tax partner on
July 1.
As tax correspondent for The Herald between 1978 and 1990, Mr
Fairbairn covered the Budgets of Dennis Healey, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Nigel
Lawson and John Major.
His move to managing partner saved him from analysing the fiscal
reasonings of Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke.
Mr Fairbairn, 47, will be succeeded in his current post by Jack Perry,
who is currently head of audit in the Glasgow office.
A law graduate of Edinburgh University, Mr Fairbairn joined a
predecessor firm of Ernst &amp; Young, Glasgow-based Grahams Rintoul, in
1969.
He qualified as a chartered accountant in 1973 and became a partner
only two years later, having spent 1974 and 1975 learning tax in London.
His quicker-than-normal progression was facilitated by his law degree
and his firm's wish to appoint a tax partner.
Between 1982 and 1990, Mr Fairbairn was head of tax in the Glasgow
office of what was initially Arthur Young and ultimately Ernst &amp; Young,
following the merger with Ernst &amp; Whinney.
The national tax partner vacancy arose as a result of fellow Scot
Andrew Jones's step up to UK managing partner. Mr Fairbairn was selected
on the basis of his expertise in tax matters and his management
experience of running a big office.
Looking forward to his appointment, Mr Fairbairn, a council member of
the Confederation of British Industry Scotland who has just handed over
the chair of the West of Scotland Institute of Directors, said: ''It is
quite a challenge. I am very excited at the prospect of further
developing our UK tax practice, which is thriving.
''I enjoyed my spell in London when I first started my tax career some
20 years ago. It is a very exciting place to work.''

A VENTURE capital fund, geared to the needs of small and medium-sized
businesses in the Highlands and Islands, was launched yesterday in
Inverness.
Up to #2.25m, in tranches of less than #250,000, will be made
available through HIE Ventures for small-scale start-ups and expansions
during the next three years.
It is envisaged that the hi-tech sector will be among those to benefit
from the provision of development finance in smaller quantities than are
normally available.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise is contributing #500,000, thereby
making #1m of European Objective 1 funds available for the initiative.
Financial institutions, including Bank of Scotland and Aberdeen-based
Abtrust Fund Managers, are contributing #750,000.
Abtrust will manage the fund through an independent company based in
Inverness, part of an expansion into the Highlands by the fund
management group.
HIE chairman Fraser Morrison said: ''Fund managers, in particular, are
often unwilling to consider sums under #250,000. That closes the door to
the hundreds of small and medium-sized Highlands and Islands firms which
dominate our economy.''

LONDON &amp; Manchester Group has set aside #24m to cover compensation
payments for people wrongly advised to swap from company pension schemes
into personal policies, it was revealed yesterday.
The #24m also covers the costs of reviewing the cases which might
require compensation.
The Exeter-based group, which said it had only a small share of the
personal pensions transfer market, admitted that company pension schemes
were usually preferable to personal policies.
In the past thousands of people have been persuaded to opt out of
company schemes in favour of personal policies. Many will be paid
compensation for the losses following the wrong advice.
Its life operations saw new annual premiums fall by 6% although this
was largely associated with the fall-off in pensions' business.
Taxable profits grew from #33.4m in 1993 to #38.9m last year although
these were swollen by #4m representing the difference between a #7.7m
loss on the sale of its commercial property services operation and an
#11.7m profit on the disposal of its consumer finance business.
Investors will see their dividend go up to 17.16p from 15.68p on
earnings per share of 20.62p against 20.49p.

DESPITE having to set aside #145,000 to cover related returns and bad
debts associated with the receivership of Pentos, former owner of
Dillons bookshops, publishers Cassell increased annual profits by 38% to
#827,000.
In its first year as a public company book sales rose 15.6% to #20.7m
helped by strong demand for the Catechism of the Catholic Church,
however the group experienced a 1% decline in gross margin. This
reflected sluggish business in the book chains and book clubs.
Dillons accounted for #1m of Cassell's sales last year while WH Smith
and Waterstones was reponsible for #2m of sales as were book clubs
worldwide.
Philip Sturrock, Cassell's chairman and chief executive, is supportive
of the Net Book Agreement (NBA) which determines minimum retail prices.
He said it was desirable to have a range of stockholding bookshops,
something which differentiated the UK from overseas bookmarkets.
Mr Sturrock said it remained the publisher's choice whether to
entirely abide by the NBA. Cassell's dictionaries are not covered by the
NBA.
The company is optimistic about its future prospects and remains on
the lookout for acquisitions, particularly US academic publishers.
Academic books make up around 12% of sales, with religious books
accounting for 9%. Cassell acquired Pinter Publishers earlier this year
which added two academic imprints, namely Pinter and Leicester
University Press.
It also expects to grow organically through selective development of
electronic publishing in the professional and academic areas. This year
the Catechism of the Catholic Church will be published both on floppy
disk and (together with Bible texts) on CD-ROM.
This year, Cassell intends to publish at least 750 new titles compared
with 600 last year. It has high hopes for High Fidelity by Nick Hornby
and will also be publishing major biographies of Michael Foot and Imran
Khan.
The flotation and good trading led to a positive cash balance of
#403,000 at the year-end. There is a maiden dividend payment of 3p per
share.
Cassell shares were steady at 133p.

VR, technological tool of the
future, is already playing an
important role in engineering,
reports Geraldine Abrahams
VIRTUAL reality (VR) is the future now and it is fun. Not
surprisingly, given the way the computer industry itself has progressed,
many of its operations are game-based, revolving around scenarios that
lead us on to different dimensions, different planes, exploring
possibilities that were previously unimaginable.
The lay person's knowledge of VR is likely to be confined to
futuristic Disney movies and television programmes that find solutions
to bizarre problems enacted in computer graphic environments. While that
perception is not inaccurate, it fails to recognise the vital role that
VR plays and will increasingly play in industry and commerce.
Virtual reality is about finding solutions, not just in the field of
leisure but through its use as a technological tool applied in
engineering and commerce, and at a recent seminar entitled Virtual
Reality -- Tool or Toy?, the wonders of its applications were unfolded.
''Virtual reality has extended well beyond arcade games and Jurassic
Park. It is very much a business tool for designers in industry,'' says
David Robson, a senior design executive at Scottish Design, which
collaborated with the Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) group to
organise the seminar which examined the engineering applications of
virtual reality.
''It can allow an architect to walk through a building that hasn't
been built yet. It can allow an engineer to sit in the model of a car
that hasn't been built, check the radio, look out through the rear-view
mirror, look at the instrumentation. It allows a doctor to undertake
practical surgery on a patient who doesn't exist.
''Not only does it allow these designers and practitioners to
experience virtual environments that do not exist but importantly it
allows them to change what exists in that electronic model.
''So people can change the design of a building before it has been
built, or the design of a car before they invest hundreds of thousands
of pounds making prototype models. They can change the procedures of
surgery before they start cutting up people on the operating table.''
Robson considers the ability to change, to practise, and to simulate
things that do not exist, to be the real power of virtual reality, and
his colleague and fellow senior design executive at Scottish Design, Ian
McCoull, agrees.
''Virtual reality is technology which has been looking for a good
application for some time,'' he says. ''We can look at the engineering
applications of virtual reality in situations like walking through a
submarine where they have changed the ergonomics placement of certain
components, or the case of the Hubble telescope at NASA, which shows how
the astronauts practise and train.
One of the case studies presented at the VR seminar was that of
Virtual Teleoperation at Scottish Nuclear.
Scottish Nuclear has invested about #100,000 in IGRIP, a VR and
simulation package supplied by DENEB Solutions, which is part of
Intelligent Systems Solutions Ltd.
Its use has been focused on fuel-handling operations at Torness, where
Scottish Nuclear built a virtual reality model that extends from the
reactor charge hall down to the chutes in the fuel storage ponds.
Virtual reality and computer simulations are advantageous in this kind
of work because of their flexibility in showing equipment and plant from
every possible angle, allowing repair and maintenance work to be
rehearsed and practised so that when it comes to doing the actual work
it is both safer and quicker.
By using virtual reality computer solutions in training, Scottish
Nuclear has saved more than #4m in potential lost output and costs.
According to one of the company's experts in the field, the nuclear
industry is indebted to the entertainment industry for introducing the
kind of computer graphic technology -- such as virtual reality -- that
has enabled the nuclear industry to achieve improvements in staff
training and operation through the use of computer simulation.
Eric Tottman-Trayner, a fuel-route engineer at Scottish Nuclear, said:
''VR is being used to enhance operator awareness and to assist in a
number of operation scenarios. This is most useful where visualisation
-- the need to 'see' on the computer simulation -- is required to give
the operator a good appreciation of the normal operation of the
equipment which he or she will possibly never have seen before, or may
only have seen from a restricted angle.
''A trainee can then demonstrate his or her understanding of the
problem and machinery without risk to equipment or personnel safety.''
In an industry such as the nuclear one, such considerations are vital.

THOSE misguided souls who constantly carp about the seven-a-side game
as having little attraction or relevance, and as standing in the way of
a fuller version cup competition -- as if the two cannot go hand-in-hand
-- might have adjusted that viewpoint had they been at Netherdale on
Saturday.
Sure, there were one or two dreich ties, some of the runaway variety,
but there also were a number of riveting confrontations which went to
the wire, and included several in which sides fought back from the dead
to inch home.
Some 92 tries were scored at an average of more than six per tie.
There was a representative mix -- a string of passes, or others of the
long range, runaway variety as when that sevens specialist, Gordon
Mackay, fielded a re-start some 70-metres out and covered the entire
distance with most of Melrose in vain pursuit.
Those who attend Borders sevens tournaments generally are fortunate in
the quality of fare placed before them. For one thing, it is hard
sometimes to tell forwards from backs except perhaps in the difference
in acceleratory pace.
So much preparation for the fuller version involves ball work, and so
often nowadays in 15s, forwards detach from the close quarter situations
to provide attack augmentation, that they have to be just as skilled as
their aristocratic brethren in the giving and taking of passes and,
equally, in improvising passes to meet changing situations.
So ball transference in sevens nowadays is of a higher grade than ever
before. In one sequence on Saturday, Gala moved ball right, then left,
then right again in stringing together more than a dozen passes of
magical quality.
To have witnessed New Zealand winning the Hong Kong title then, six
days later, Gala putting together some mesmeric combinations for 20
tries at their own tournament surely was to have experienced the very
highest rung of sevens play at international and club level. Nor could
one help comparing the two. It might seem a bit far fetched to mention
Gala in the same breath as New Zealand, but there were distinct
similarities in style because the basic ingredients for success were the
same.
Of course, Gala have no-one quite like Jonah Lomu, the 19-year-old
human bulldozer who, at 18[1/2] stones and no dreadnaught simply took
Hong Kong by storm as resembling in so many ways his bulky predecessor,
Inga Tuigamala. Even when Lomu was not striding through stricken
opponents for his five-tries in four ties, he proved a huge blessing to
his teammates because so often it took two or three opponents to arrest
him.
Just like the New Zealanders, however, the Gala players appreciate the
need for the four Ps in the short game -- possession, position, pace and
puff. Their choice of an international hooker in Ian Corcoran ensures
scrummage delivery and accurate throwing in. That Corcoran has good
hands is a bonus. Nor is a lineout specialist all that essential in
sevens.
So Neil Crooks is big enough and wiley enough and John Amos is a
renowned ball winner at stoppage points. Gala have no-one in quite the
class of Eric Rush or, indeed, Dallas Seymour. Yet all three forwards
have proved capable of scoring from far out.
In other respects also, Gala's method seems to be modelled on that of
New Zealand. Their sense of positioning is a vital element. Aware of the
fact that anyone in front of the ball is out of the action, Gala's
players are desperately quick at realigning behind the ball so that
options are available and the player in possession is not exposed or
isolated.
In overall pace too Gala and New Zealand are alike. New Zealand have
Peter Woods, Joe Pauiwi, Joeli Vineiri, Rush and Seymour. Gala have a
jewel in Mark Moncrieff with impressive back-up from Michael Dods and
that scuttling little rubber ball, Grant Farquharson.
As for puff, the ability through superb fitness to last the furious
pace of 65 minutes of sevens play is another factor common to the New
Zealand and Gala success stories. They spread the load. A significant
feature at both Hong Kong and Netherdale was that the tries were spread
throughout their squads with only the four scored by Moncrieff in the
Gala final hinting at over-work.
Communication also is a common thread and such an important factor in
the support positioning at which New Zealand and Gala excel.
Those New Zealanders already have installed themselves as sevens
champions on the basis of their scintilating team work in Hong Kong.
Gala, having taken the first step towards perhaps being crowned as
Scotland's top club seven, face a big hurdle at Greenyards on Saturday
with Manly from Australia, Villager from Cape Town, and Oxford and
Cambridge Universities in the field. However, as they play like New
Zealanders, the men of Netherdale will be ill to topple.

CELEBRATIONS, when you follow Partick Thistle, occasionally have to be
enjoyed for less triumphant reasons than would appeal to fans of more
fashionable and wealthier clubs, which is why there may be a little
party in the Maryhill area tonight if their team beat Hearts in the
re-arranged premier-division game at Firhill.
Three points would lift Thistle away from the bottom place in the
league and instil even greater optimism in supporters who, by their
nature, are already greatly blessed in that direction.
Their manager, John Lambie, is not short in that area, either. He is
aware that his team could yet defy the forecasts of doom which have
already relegated his men to the first division next season, and allows
himself a brief moment of pleasure at the discomfort his team is causing
in the pundit department. ''They had us dead and buried three months
ago,'' he recalled, ''but that doesn't matter. What counts is what we do
in the run-in.''
Should Thistle win tonight, they would leap-frog Aberdeen and still
have a game in hand of all the other teams trying to escape the trap
door. The impossible is beginning to look within their grasp.
Lambie prefers to be more cautious. ''The players have done a
tremendous job concentrating and battling the way they have for the past
couple of months but they have to keep it going now. I hope they can do
it.''
So pleased was he with his side's fighting comeback to draw with Hibs
at Firhill at the weekend that he is not likely to change the team
unless he is forced into it. ''Steve Pittman is the only doubt, although
he doesn't look as bad as we thought when he was carried off on
Saturday.''
The temptation to bring in the fresher legs of new signing, Roger Eli,
who came on as a substitute against Hibs, will probably be resisted
because the manager is reluctant to interrupt the flow.
Thistle point out that there will be half-price admission for the game
which was abandoned originally because of a snowstorm.
Hearts have a load of injury problems which will leave manager Tommy
McLean with a number of decisions to make, not least in goal, where
former Thistle man, Craig Nelson, was carried off on Saturday with a
knee injury. He does have the consolation of knowing that the deputy,
Henry Smith, has a fair bit of experience.
At 39, Henry has been over the course a few times and is ready for the
call if it comes. Smith has been giving the younger man the benefit of
his lengthy time in the game, and believes Nelson has tremendous
potential, but that would not prevent him looking forward to a return to
the spotlight.
If Thistle have a clear incentive to win, Hearts could use the points
as well. A victory would lift them into fifth place in the table and
leave them relaxed and ready to tackle Airdrie in the cup semi-final on
Saturday.
Meanwhile, emotions will run high tonight as Clydebank meet Raith
Rovers in their first home game since the sudden death of Davie Cooper.
Clydebank secretary Ian Steedman confirmed yesterday that the club
will not use the No.7 jersey again this season as a mark of respect.
The evening will also be a difficult one for the Raith manager Jimmy
Nicholl, who was a personal friend of Cooper. Members of the winger's
family may attend and there will be a one minute's silence before the
game.
But Steedman added: ''While it will be an emotional evening for all of
us, David would be the first person to say we need to play and get
something from the game.''
Teenager Joe Robertson, formerly with Rangers, could start for the
first time, with striker Ken Eadie suspended and both Craig Flannigan
(groin) and James Grady (ankle) missing through injury.
Nicholl pointed out: ''A win would take us into joint-top position,
but we need to play better than we have in recent games.''
* HIBS are the latest club to be interested in Forfar striker Dave
Bingham. But with the transfer deadline past, Bingham is likely to stay
with the third-division leaders until the summer. He already has turned
down the chance of a move south because of his wife's employment.
Bingham will play tonight as Forfar seek to increase their 12-point
lead in their re-scheduled clash with Montrose.
Montrose caretaker manager Andy Dornan was boosted by their five-goal
win on Saturday and said: ''The three points for us would make us

MORGAN Crucible's markets have picked up, enabling the carbon and
industrial ceramics group to post profits 10% higher at #72.6m for 1994.
Managing director Dr Bruce Farmer yesterday said economic recovery is
taking place in most of Morgan's markets and the current year has begun
on a strong note. Dividends for 1994 are lifted by 4% to 13.1p, with a
final of 7.15p.
Underlying sales were up 7% at #738m as the group gained market share
and margins improved from 10.2% to 10.8% as the benefits of price
increases, new product development, and restructuring started to come
through.
Carbon products had a good 1994, with operating profits up 13% at
#19.5m as margins widened. The first phase of the European
rationalisation programme is virtually finished, while the North
American programme is ''progressing well''.
Technical ceramics were 4% ahead at #18.9m despite cuts in defence and
aerospace programmes in the US, which were offset by progress elsewhere.
Thermal ceramics had profits up 12% at #25.1m. Price increases have been
introduced and order books are strong. Speciality materials also did
better, with a 5% advance.
Dr Farmer said orders are 10% up on a year ago, with demand in the US
and South-east Asia strong and order intake improving in Europe,
particularly France and Germany. He forecast another good year in 1995.
Morgan shares rose 13p to 330p, where they sell at 15 times earnings and
yield 5%.

GOVETT &amp; Co has put its fund management business up for sale less than
three weeks after it was forced to abandon a major expansion of the
operation through a US acquisition, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Schroders and Bear Stearns have been engaged to find buyers for its
subsidiaries John Govett &amp; Co in London and Govett Asset Management
Company in San Francisco. Govett is best known for its investment
trusts, such as Govett Strategic and Govett Oriental. It also has
smaller companies trusts covering American, Asian, and global markets.
The trend in fund management is toward a fewer number of larger
companies as competition intensifies and globalisation increases,
particularly in pension fund management. Economies of scale can be
realised and marketing costs reduced.
This was the reason for its agreement to buy Duff &amp; Phelps of Chicago
in January. Before the deal could be consummated Govett received a
lawsuit from Govet American Endeavour Fund, which it managed, alleging
breach of management duties which resulted in a $20m loss for the fund.
Govett denounced the suit as ''utterly without merit'' and launched a
counter claim for damages. However, Govett shares were badly hit by the
news and on March 16 the group was forced to withdraw the offer to buy
Duff &amp; Phelps.

CAMAS, the demerged construction materials business of English China
Clays, made a profit of #19.2m in 1994. On a pro forma basis its profits
in 1993 were just under #11m. CAMAS was demerged from English China
Clays on 31 May, 1994, at an exceptional cost of #1.5m, writes NICOLA
REEVES.
Turnover grew by 23% to #450m. Of total sales, the bulk is derived
from Europe principally the UK. The company also operates in the US in
Colorado, Minnesota and North Dakota.
Building products prices rose in the year. For example, average prices
for aggregates were 9% higher than in 1994. Commodity products had a
better year with paving and kerb block paving showing improved margins.
CAMAS is heavily involved in the Government's roads programme.
Higher prices together with increased volumes enabled European
operating profit to rise by 64% to #16.1m. Margins rose from 3.4% to
4.8%. Trading conditions were mixed in the US. Improved trading in
Minneapolis offset the expected decline in Denver profits due to reduced
aggregate volumes following completion of the international airport.
The group's balance sheet remained strong with gearing at 26%. Net
indebtedness rose by #7.3m to #57.3m.
Camas shares rose a penny to 77p where they yield 6% on the promised
3.75p total dividend. Shareholders will receive a final payment of 2.5p.

IT is sincerely to be hoped that when the local government electors
cast their votes on April 6 to elect councillors to the welcome new
all-purpose local authorities with their onerous responsibilities for
the prudent, fair, and efficient discharge of all future local authority
functions, they will consider very carefully whether they should vote
for any members of their present councils who who are seeking election
to the new authorities but who have proved inadequate, incompetent, or
simply lazy in carrying out their present duties as servants of the
public.
The new authorities require and deserve councillors of integrity who
will be prepared and able to bring new ideas, innovative thinking, and
dedication to the provision of efficient and economical services for the
public and by the selection of senior staff of probity and
professionalism ensure the establishment of a working environment in
which they employees may give of their best without fear of bullying or
intimidation.

TRAIN-spotting rarely springs to mind as a potential vice. As a
youthful hobby, indeed, it has much to recommend it. Many a mother must
have sighed with relief as she packed sandwiches and buttoned her son's
anorak, safe in the knowledge that his Saturday would be spent on a
platform, collecting numbers, rather than practising screw shots in some
smoke-filled snooker den. Like so many enthusiasms, alas, train-spotting
is only harmless in moderation. A terrible warning for those who take
the subject too seriously came with the recent downfall of a 37-year-old
Avon County Council official, whose ambition to travel the entire
network of the United Kingdom could not be satisfied on his #35,000
salary. Despite having already journeyed 22,770 miles, and been pulled
by 560 different locomotives, to finance the rest of his odyssey he was
led to trick British Rail into paying false compensation for late
trains. The irony of the conviction, for forgery and deception, was that
the prosecution relied on his own meticulous records, which showed that
while he claimed to have been delayed in Wiltshire, for instance, he was
actually train-spotting in Yeovil.
Fortunately there is soon to be an academic outlet for train
enthusiasts. York University has just appointed Colin Divall as its
first Professor of Railway Studies, and he is planning post-graduate
degrees. It will be interesting to see how York copes with
train-spotters once they are supported by public funds. What satisfies
an amateur, of course, perhaps collecting material for privately
published volumes like Signal Boxes of the Forfar &amp; Arbroath Light
Railway (1880-1918), can easily lead further afield . . . measuring
track gradients in the High Andes, or pneumatic brake valves in Siberia.
Such subjects could hardly be studied from a distance, of course, and
they might easily qualify for a grant. There is no harm in asking York
for a brochure.

THOSE who are elected at the polls on Thursday must shadow the
existing regional authorities in preparation for their own assumption of
power on April 1 next year. This implies that they will drift along in
the umbra and penumbra of their big brother, gently absorbing the
lessons and experiences which will be theirs in the future. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Councillors who emerge triumphantly
this week face an extraordinary barrage of facts and figures on subjects
of which they are largely ignorant at the moment. They will be called
upon to make plans, budgets, and joint agreements, sometimes with
friends, often with political enemies.
The best-informed estimates suggest that the bulk of the councillors
who join the shadow authorities will come from district councils. No
doubt these will be noble and committed people, but they have no
experience of administering education, social work, or roads and
transport. These three, and particularly the first, are highly complex,
and big spenders to boot. Half of all local authority spending in
Scotland goes on education and this is unlikely to diminish. If shadow
councillors approach education with keen apprehension and a willingness
to learn, all might go well enough. There is evidence, though, that a
substantial proportion have little understanding of the issues, indeed
believe that schools will be handling the bulk of their budget
themselves, therefore there might be less need for councillors to be
involved. Again, nothing could be further from the truth. Sensitivity,
understanding, and substantial commitment will be needed if the
education system is to survive under the new dispensation.
In all of this there will be guidance from the Scottish Office and
powers to allow the Secretary of State to propel unwilling joint
purchasers of services or planners of joint budgets into each other's
arms. In the context of the new framework, with its fragmentations and
complexities, this will be necessary. It is also regrettable because it
intrudes central government into areas which were formerly handled
competently enough by the regions. Other duties lurk in the shadows.
Regional properties must be shared out (a huge task), the structure of
committees and their personnel decided while spending priorities are
decided, Government help (if any) assessed, and all of it accompanied by
the discovery of how much debt the new authorities will inherit. Once
more, we urge voters to bear in mind the services they enjoy at the
moment, to ask every candidate they can buttonhole how these services
can be maintained and improved upon, and to vote for whichever one (no
matter of what party) who gives a convincing and coherent answer.

THE Marquess of Blandford was remanded on conditional bail into the
care of a private clinic yesterday after appearing in court accused of
forging prescriptions, stealing drugs, and failing to pay a taxi fare.
The 39-year-old was ordered to attend the Charter Nightingale
Hospital, in Chelsea, until his next appearance before London's
Horseferry Road Magistrates Court on April 10.
The Marquess, charged in the name of Charles James Blandford, stood
before acting stipendiary magistrate Alan Jones. He stared at the floor
as the alleged offences were read out.
He was accused with two counts of forging prescriptions purporting to
prescribe quantities of three drugs on or before March 27.
He was also accused of the theft of the medications, valued at #15.88,
from a chemist shop in Chelsea on March 27.
The Marquess, whose occupation was given on the charge sheet as a
farmer of Lawrence Street, Chelsea, was further accused with making off
without payment of a taxi fare in west London on March 28.
He did not enter formal pleas to the charges.
He had to make two appearances in court yesterday, the first being
adjourned pending a bail application. He had spent the night in cells
following his arrest on Sunday.
On his return to the dock, the Marquess, clutching two packets of
cigarettes behind his back, was allowed to leave the court after the
magistrate granted him conditional bail.
He battled through reporters, photographers, and TV crews before
flagging down a taxi and being driven away unaccompanied.
The Marquess was disinherited from control of the family seat,
Blenheim Palace, last year after a successful application brought by his
father, the 11th Duke of Marlborough, at the High Court.
The court allowed the creation of a trust to prevent him having any
control of the #100m estate.

AN elderly Asian woman, who was refused entry to Britain to visit her
15 grandchildren, has lost a legal battle in her bid to reverse the
decision.
Mrs Azizan Bibi told immigration officials she wanted to travel from
her home in Pakistan to stay with her son in Glasgow for eight weeks and
see her grandchildren, who were born and brought up in Britain.
But an entry clearance officer at the British High Commission in
Islamabad rejected her application after interviewing her.
The elderly widow subsequently tried to have her case reviewed by the
Immigration Appeal Tribunal but was refused leave to appeal.
She then sought a judicial review of the decision at the Court of
Session in Edinburgh but Lord Kirkwood has now ruled against her.
The entry clearance officer said the 70-year-old woman, from
Faisalabad, in Pakistan, was ''unable or unwilling'' to state how long
she would remain in the UK if she were admitted.
The officer said: ''She did, however, state that I could, should I so
wish, give her an entry clearance for life. I was unable to interpret
this as anything other than an admission of a desire to settle in the
United Kingdom.''
The widow had said during the interview she would return to Pakistan,
as she had daughters there.
But the entry clearance officer decided she was not credible as a
visitor to the UK, where several members of her family, including her
son, Mr Faqir Mohammed, of Carn-arven Street, Glasgow, live.
An initial appeal in the case was held before an adjudicator in
Glasgow, who dismissed her case.
She in turn then sought to make her case before the Immigration Appeal
Tribunal, but the tribunal chairman refused to grant her leave to
appeal, stating there had been no misdirection in law.
The case was brought to the Court of Session but Lord Kirkwood ruled
that it had not been shown that no reasonable chairman of the appeals
tribunal would have refused leave to appeal.
The judge said: ''The chairman of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was
entitled to reach the view that the conclusions of the adjudicator were
fully supported by the evidence and that there had been no misdirection
in law.''

Patrick Brogan reports from Washington how America is being smothered
by an ever-growing avalanche of regulations -- but now some states are
trying to fight back.
THE South Bronx in New York City has for decades been one of the great
international symbols of urban decay. In 1988, the city sold Mother
Teresa two abandoned buildings for a dollar each so that her order, the
Missionaries of Charity, might convert them into a homeless centre.
The order set aside $500,000 for the project, which would provide
housing for 64 homeless and destitute men. There would be kitchens and
dining rooms on the ground floors of the two buildings, communal lounges
on the first floors, and bedrooms above them.
It took the city bureaucracy 18 months to approve the renovation
scheme, through a long, tedious process involving endless public
hearings and a mountain of paperwork. At the end of it, the city told
Mother Teresa that she could go ahead, provided that she met one or two
requirements laid down by city ordinance.
One of these was that every multiple-occupancy building have a lift.
The sisters said that they did not need a lift. Putting them in would
cost at least $100,000 and they had better uses for the money.
But the bureaucrats were obdurate. No lift, no permit. The
Missionaries of Charity took their $500,000, and their concerns for the
homeless, elsewhere.
A few years earlier, the skating rink in Central Park had been closed
because it was falling apart. The city spent five years and countless
millions planning, debating and getting ready to repair it, but never
actually began the job. Finally, in an astonishing burst of
administrative creativeness, the city gave up, and handed the project
over to a commercial developer, Donald Trump. He had a new skating rink
finished and operating in six months.
Stories like this are at the heart of a debate in Congress over the
future of Government regulation. Improving the paralysing system that is
crippling the country is one of the items on the Republicans' Contract
with America.
Newt Gingrich and his friends have followed Alexander's example and
taken the chopper to the problem. They have passed a Bill freezing all
regulations. The Government may issue no more for a year, while the
whole system is put up for reform.
This is, of course, rather extreme (and the Bill will probably not
survive the Senate and a presidential veto). In 1963, the Federal
Register, which lists all new Government rules, published 15,000 pages
of new regulations. In 1992 it published 70,000 pages.
The Republicans insist that nothing short of the meat-axe approach to
reform will suffice to rescue the country from the horrors of
over-regulation. They have a point.
Their bible is a book called The Death of Common Sense: How Law is
Suffocating America, by Philip Howard, a lawyer.
Mr Howard pulls together numerous examples of bureaucratic folly, from
Mother Teresa in New York to a list of 140 regulations concerning wooden
ladders.
He notes that the Environmental Protection Agency's rule book is over
10,000 pages long; that bed-and-breakfast establishments in New York
state will have to close this year because they do not provide separate
fire escapes, as the rules lay down for all hotels; that brickmakers
must take elaborate and thoroughly documented precautions to protect
their workers from the dangers of sand; that a two-person company in
Florida was cited for failing to warn its staff of the potential hazards
of Windex (to clean windows) and Joy (a dish-washing detergent).
Twenty-five per cent of hospital costs is devoted to paperwork.
Government procurement, buying everything from pencils to aircraft
carriers, is so beset with rules and regulations that the additional
cost may be anything from 10% to 25%. All levels of Government and
public institutions in the United States spend about $450 billion a year
on procurement, so that's a lot of waste.
The principle behind it all is that life can be made fair and just
only by a strict and equal application of rules. The notion is that
there can be a rule for everything, and once Congress has passed a law,
say the Endangered Species Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act,
rules must be devised and enforced to apply them.
Mr Howard notes that despite the effort at precision, 80% of the
Environment Protection Agency (EPA)'s decisions and 96% of decisions
reached by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are
taken to court.
Another New York example: there are few or no public toilets because
they are constantly vandalised or used for drug purposes and
prostitution. The problem has been solved, or at least mitigated, in
Europe by commercially run pay-toilets set on the pavements.
New York decided to try out a French system -- but there is an
anti-discrimination law stating that it is illegal to ''withhold or
deny'' from the disabled access to public accommodation. People in
wheelchairs could not use the new public toilets, so there could be none
for anyone.
When we last heard, three pairs of the French toilets had been
installed, one of each regular, the other pair for wheelchair-users. The
wheelchair-users' toilets need an attendant and are, therefore, very
expensive. They are also never used, while the regular ones are in
constant use and highly successful.
Florida is trying to reverse the tide by scrapping its rules and
allowing civil servants to reach decisions on the merits. It is a brave
attempt, but can only make a dent in the vast edifice of bureaucratic
obfuscation.
One of the few really popular initiatives of the Clinton
administration, run by Vice-President Al Gore, has been dubbed
''reinventing government''. The idea is to make government the ally
instead of the enemy, of ordinary citizens.
Washington was astonished to discover how popular the idea was.
When the Republicans denounce government, they evoke a huge popular
response -- because everyone has had to deal with incompetent
bureaucrats and competent ones whose hands are tied by nonsensical
regulations.
The root of the matter is America's devotion to due process: every
decision must be absolutely fair, and that can only be achieved by
detailed laws and regulations. Each citizen must be treated equally,
even if that means that there can be no public toilets at all.
One of the great American shibboleths, inscribed on every court house
in the land, is that the United States ''Is a Government of Laws, not of
Men.'' That's why the Government is grinding into the ground.
The law cannot provide for every contingency, and when it tries, then
no-one is responsible (''It's a Government of laws -- no man is
responsible. Sorry.'') We need a more root-and-branch revolution than
freezing the Federal Register for a year. But at least there is abroad a
mood demanding that something be tried.

MICHAEL Portillo, Employment Secretary and doyen of the Conservative
right, has finally publicly admitted that his party is in crisis. This
is yet another clear measure of the fear within the Conservative Party
about their prospects for a record fifth General Election win. Mr
Portillo and fellow right-wing Tories have over the weekend turned for
solace to the tax issue.
While he himself may not have been the instigator of the last few
days' debate, he was quite happy to suggest on ITV's Dimbleby programme
that the past four General Elections have been largely about tax. This
was a subtle part of the growing right-wing pressure on tax prompted by
hints from both Prime Minister John Major and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
that plans to cut tax are now firmly back on the Government's agenda.
For the Chancellor, there is mounting pressure to produce a plan on
taxation that extends beyond the latest possible date for a General
Election in mid-1997. While there may be nothing new about tax cuts as a
Conservative strategy, what is remarkable in this latest instalment is
the way in which taxation is being linked directly to electoral fortunes
by Conservative MPs themselves.
Right-wing back benchers who see their heads on the electoral chopping
block are, as never before, effectively asking their superiors to bribe
the electorate. This is evident in the plans which several influential
back benchers are now backing. The plan would involve not simply cutting
taxes now, but in each year until 1999. The clear intention is to
prevent a new Conservative Government having to raise taxes in a similar
fashion to that after the 1992 General Election, when at that time there
was, and still is, a wide perception that the Conservatives broke their
promise not to raise tax.
There are a number of dangers for the Conservatives if they resort to
tax as the key to electoral success. In the first instance there is an
assumption that tax has done the job for them in the past. However, even
in 1992, when tax appeared to be the main battle-ground, subsequent
analysis finds scant evidence for it as the make-or-break issue.
Secondly, linking tax cuts so directly to General Election success
risks further insulting an electorate who may simply have had enough of
a Conservative Government that is doing its best to pull itself apart.
Lastly, tax cuts may not be enough even if accepted readily by
potential Conservative voters. If security and optimism still prevent
that crucial ''feel good'' factor then the Tories may simply find
themselves going for broke.

TAL FARLOW'S appearances in Scotland are rare, and a bumper turnout
left the organisers in the unhappy position of turning people away while
only just breaking even with the help of sponsorship. In the sauna-like
atmosphere the 73-year-old guitarist was the coolest figure, setting the
tone with the opening Lil' Darlin', an unhurried tune at the best of
times but here taken at a pace several mph short of a crawl. Later
Charlie Parker's bebop classic, Billie's Bounce, assumed the luminous
quality of a ballad without being in any way dilatory.
Farlow made no concessions volume-wise to the packed house, discarding
the microphone for his introductions and then discarding the
introductions, too, as he and his colleagues for the night, Ronnie Rae
(bass) and Tony Maclennan (drums), invited the audience to eavesdrop on
an intimate jam session.
Rae has worked with Farlow before, on the memorable early-eighties
tour which reunited the guitarist with vibist Red Norvo, and the pair
quickly developed an understanding which produced some inspired
improvised mutual support as Maclennan selflessly kept the drums
dampened down to cardboard-box level.
Often we were not only eavesdropping, we were being asked to name that
tune. An apparently random chord sequence with fractured references to a
melody would suddenly emerge as -- of course! -- Body and Soul or In A
Sentimental Mood. Listening to Farlow can be a cerebral rather than an
emotional business, but it's pleasurable all the same.

THE BBC has been foolish and has been rescued by the common sense of
the Court of Session in Edinburgh. That much is clear in the aftermath
of the successful attempt by the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats
to block the broadcasting of the Prime Minister's lengthy interview on
Panorama. Scheduled for last night the programme would clearly have
presented the Conservatives with a golden opportunity to air their views
just three days away from the elections for the shadow unitary
authorities.
Lord Abernethy's view of the matter is clear and straightforward; he
believes that any interview so close to the election would have
prejudiced it and he is correct. So were the three Law Lords who turned
down the BBC's last minute appeal. What is astonishing is the
unrepentant stance of the BBC, first for having taken the decision to
show the interview, and then in persisting with their opinion. This was
taken to the height of impertinence in the BBC statement last night that
the interim interdict held important implications for the freedom of
broadcasters to do their job, presumably with the implication that the
freedom of the media was at stake.  That is ridiculous and the truth of
the matter is entirely different. The BBC and the Panorama editors
recorded the interview and planned to show it without the slightest
thought or regard to the fact that there were Scottish elections in
close proximity. Undoubtedly they did not remember the fact of the
elections here in the first place. They compounded their error by
insisting that the broadcast should go ahead and in this they were
utterly wrong. We must try hard not to be nationalist in a petty sense
about this issue, but the disregard for the political situation in
Scotland which has been shown by the BBC is really quite breathtaking.
Other matters, of a more local nature, make the affair even worse.
It is clear that nobody in the BBC in Scotland had the courage, and
most certainly not the clout, to stand up to London on the issue. They
may have briefed London but there are no signs of even the slightest
struggle. The implications of this disgraceful affair will continue to
reverberate, but if the BBC wishes to be considered as a national
broadcasting organisation it would do well to reconsider its actions as
a matter of urgency, and then to apologise.

DRIVING at 70mph on a motorway is safer than a journey to the local
shops, according to an RAC survey of traffic accidents.
For just three in every 100 injury accidents are on motorways,
compared with three in four of all crashes which take place in 40mph
limit areas.
While long-distance motorists concentrate on being alert at speed,
drivers making shorter trips will pay less attention.
Those trying to beat the clock to get to work through the rush hour
are even more likely to crash, said the RAC, which questioned more than
800 drivers.
Overall, more than 70% of British motorists have had an accident
behind the wheel, and most of those have had at least two crashes.
Men are more likely to be in an accident -- a 75% chance compared to a
65% risk for women -- but men do make more and longer trips.
Despite the figures, drivers still think they are more likely to crash
on a motorway than a residential road.
A staggering 95% of all accidents are the fault of human error,
according to official figures, although only 75% of drivers themselves
agreed.
Mr Kevin Delaney, the RAC's road safety manager, said: ''Over half the
motorists questioned were more worried about having an accident on the
motorway.
''But when people get on to a fast flowing motorway they concentrate
harder, and that means fewer accidents.
''Well over half of all accidents happen within a couple of miles of
home, like a local trip to the shops or dropping the kids off at school.
''Lack of concentration and going too fast are the main causes. At
30mph you can brake in time if someone runs out in front of you 80ft
ahead.
''At 40mph you will hit them, whether you are driving a BMW or a
Morris Minor.

Strasbourg
A RETIRED British businessman yesterday challenged European social
legislation which, he says, discriminates against UK citizens resident
in France.
Mr Tony Battams, a former farm machinery and car salesman, now lives
in Mirepoix, southern France, where he is entitled as an EU citizen to a
French old-age pension. But the French authorities have denied him part
of his pension because he had lived in Australia for 11 years.
Mr Battams yesterday took his complaint to the president of the
European Parliament, Mr Klaus Hansch.
''There must be hundreds of thousands of British emigrants who, like
me, went to Australia, and quite a few of them have probably gone to
France to live in their later years,'' he said.
During his time in Australia, Mr Battams made social security payments
under a reciprocity agreement with the United Kingdom. This meant that
he could collect his British old-age pension without deduction in the
UK. He had assumed he could do the same in France because EU law allows
reciprocity among member states.
He now claims the French are exploiting a loophole to save money.
Mr Battams added: ''The money is not important to me. It is only about
#13 a week. I am only interested in the principle of the thing. The
French are being unfair. This is contrary to natural justice.''
His case has been taken up by Strathclyde West MEP Hugh McMahon,
Labour's social affairs spokesman in Strasbourg.
Mr McMahon said: ''The Council of Ministers recently established a
working party on social security problems inside the EU and I intend to
ensure that cases such as this are taken into consideration so that
European law can be updated''.

THE state of autism cuts off those who suffer from it from most normal
social contact. But sometimes sound can get through, so the first thing
we notice in David Glass's extraordinary evocation of autism is the
sound of a heartbeat. The first glimpse we have of him though is of his
naked back breathing in and out, like the heart pump in an operating
room. The movements gradually grow bigger until he becomes a monstrous,
almost amoebic form. Later his fingers curl, the face twists, the limbs
themselves seem to take on a life of their own.
David Glass's uncomfortable, seering portrait is far from the image of
autism in the film Rain Man. This evocation is about loss, imprisonment,
bewilderment, mental pain -- a sudden stab of contact before the dark
closes in again and Glass's face distorts into a scream.
Only the occasional sounds of musician/comforter Sarah Collins seem to
break through the wall of impenetrability that surrounds this child-man
-- water rustling, a brush scraping, the mathematical variations of a
Bach fugue.
It is heart-breaking, breath-taking stuff, a seamless piece of theatre
from designer Rae Smith's scaffold and wood room (suggesting the promise
of escape but also confinement), the subtle attentiveness of Collins and
the supreme command, ironically, Glass has of his own body. Every
movement, every breath is directed towards the creation of one who has
so little command. It's a performance of the utmost intensity and should
not be missed when Glass tours later this month.

ONCE upon a time, in the neighbourly land of Oz a chap called Dein
Perry stamped his foot. But ever so rhythmically. In time steps . . . in
buck and wings . . . in just about every tap step you can think of and a
few of his own besides. And hey! whaddaya know -- he wasn't alone. There
were other guys right there with him, feet gunning away in happy
syncopations. They had pzazz, they had enthusiasm, they had no cash.
Then the Australian Government gave them a grant.
So they danced even harder and got even better. Until one day, a
member of the company had this brilliant idea. He was called David
Atkins. And he said, ''Listen kids -- why don't we put on a show?'' And
guess what? The rest is Hot Shoe Shuffle, recently awarded the 1995
Olivier for best choreography in a musical and currently at the King's
in Glasgow.
Hot Shoe Shuffle is simply ace. It packs together choice songs by
Gershwin, Ellington, Cab Calloway, and Irving Berlin alongside dance
routines that celebrate the style of Astaire and the sass of the street
entertainers who busked steps out of the jazz and blues around them.
There is a plot. But as plots go, it goes by the board fairly soon. And
no-one cares or notices. Because the cast are driving sparks from their
taps in numbers that are sweet with individual invention, punctilious
when it comes to ensemble rap-a-tatting. Bret Jones as Spring has the
largest share of the action, but he isn't allowed to steal the show from
the rest of the troupe, all of whom have their speciality spectaculars
well in foot for the grand finale. Teddy Green is a welcome reminder
that there can be lots of mileage left in the sole of the older hoofer
while Louise Plowright as April blossoms before our very eyes into a
red-hot mother of a cross between Alice Faye and Jessica Rabbit. It's
got swing, it's got humour, it's got the ability to make you think
you've sent all your cares off on a one-way ticket to never-never land
-- who could ask for anything more?

FRIDAY marks the tenth anniversary of the death of Willie McRae, a
mystery which I have been living and breathing for the past few weeks.
No doubt the occasion will be marked by some ritual at the memorial
cairn, on the A87 by Loch Loyne. It is gratifying to think that this
year, a decade on, we have finally hardened up some of the key facts
surrounding McRae's death. And, a week after our revelations, none of
these facts -- of body, history, scene -- has been contradicted by any
authority.
There is one thing I should clarify, as my careless use of ''onside''
and ''offside'' in last Tuesday's essay may spread confusion. McRae's
car, in the photographs I saw, was leaning towards the driver's side; it
was the wheels (or a wheel) on the driver's side that might have been in
the tiny burn; and it was the headlamp on the same side of the car which
was hanging off by its wires.
Some close to McRae, talking to that esteemed and fairminded journal
the West Highland Free Press, have insisted that he was indeed depressed
and suicidal in the last days of his life. Claims of inaccuracy were
also made against my first essay, published last Monday. Such I can well
believe; much of the material in that account, as I made plain, was
drawn from a 1990 book outlining the mystery. And, as I made equally
plain, the same book is alarmingly unreliable. We had to waste valuable
time checking and counter checking some assertions it made; we simply
had no time to check them all.
As for friends and family who testify to McRae's despair in that last
week, their claims are offset by others -- equally close -- who insist
the lawyer was buoyant and happy. So hopeless is the conflict, and so
irrelevant in any event is it to the final theatre of McRae's end, that
students of the case are best ignoring such evidence completely. I will
consider McRae's supposedly suicidal state when someone explains to me
how he shot himself with a gun found several yards from his car, a gun
that yielded no fingerprints whatsoever.
The public testimony of some close to McRae now confirms that he had a
serious drink problem. Other evidence suggests that he might have had
homosexual tendencies. At best, such evidence does little more than beef
up possible motives for suicide. As far as homicide goes, it proves
nothing.
Your response to these articles has been gratifying. The ink had
barely dried on Tuesday's paper when, following a tip-off, we finally
managed to locate and interview the long-lost Ronnie Welsh. Letters and
phone calls have been pouring in. Valuable new leads are emerging,
important names and clues provided, credible explanations for various
loose ends volunteered . . . Keep thinking, and keep writing. Anyone who
reads those essays, with an open mind and a certain flexibility of
thought, is quite capable of seeing something we at The Herald have
missed. And one or two folk already have.
There are certain matters that continue to puzzle me, and on which the
opinion of others would be welcomed.
One is the extraordinary position of Dr Fergus McRae. For a decade,
Willie McRae's surviving brother -- who, more than anyone else,
frustrated hopes of a public inquiry -- has insisted, with increasing
hysteria, that the Glasgow solicitor took his own life. One beholds this
with mingled compassion and bewilderment -- I simply do not understand a
close relative wanting to believe that the sudden death of a loved one
was self-inflicted.
There is a tactical puzzle, too. A public inquiry 10 years ago -- if
it had established suicide -- would have killed the mystery stone dead.
Instead, amid whispers and conspiracy talk, the McRae mystery has
attained mythical status. Willie McRae's useful and fascinating life is
increasingly buried under speculation about this death. And, as long as
his family resists a public inquiry, his demise will retain the ghoulish
fascination of the public.
Another mystery: the deafening silence from the Crown Office. Last
week, ex-constable Kenny Crawford publicly declared that he had found
the gun on April 7, 1985, and found it several yards from McRae's car.
This directly contradicts the 1990 statement of the then Lord Advocate,
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, that the gun was found directly beneath where
the door of the car had been -- a statement he made in a public letter
to Perth and Kinross MP Nicholas Fairbairn.
Death, by a few cruel weeks, has cheated us of Fairbairn's response to
Crawford's disclosure: I suspect it would have been colourful. But the
conflict raises serious questions, and the inferences it spawns are not
pleasant. If Crawford stands by his story, and if Lord Fraser continues
to hold his own counsel, that alone should swell demand for a public
inquiry. Concerned peers should now consider a direct question to the
Minister in the House of Lords. And the SNP should ponder the matter, as
a by-election looms in Perth and Kinross for the choice of Fairbairn's
successor.
But the biggest mystery of all in the case is the gun -- that little,
silver .22 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. Evidence is now emerging that it
was, indeed, McRae's gun -- though no-one has contradicted my simple
assertion that it was the testimony of Welsh alone which identified the
gun for the authorities.
If McRae did take his own life -- and suicide has the agreeable virtue
of simplicity -- why was the gun not found close to his hand or car? It
has been suggested that it fell in the burn and was washed down some
distance by the current. Having inspected the area again -- on Saturday
-- I find this incredible. This burn is barely a foot wide; even in
heavy rain there is no great volume of water. The current is repeatedly
broken by little dams and cataracts of rock. I simply don't believe that
the heavy wee gun could have been shifted that distance by the stream,
even in full spate.
But -- if McRae was murdered -- why was the gun left at all? Any
sensible assassin would have taken the revolver with him. Unless, of
course, they were trying to fake a gunshot suicide -- in which case the
gun would have been left as close to McRae as possible. Since my essays
appeared, evidence has emerged that the gun may have been planted on the
scene after the comatose McRae was removed. But your own suggestions on
this would be welcome.
The great difficulty is establishing a credible murder scenario. You
have to explain the crash, the wound, the puncture, the new wheel on the
axle, the pile of papers . . . you have to identify an assassin and a
motive; you have to explain how that person afterwards left the scene,
in the middle of the night on a lonely road miles from habitation.
The more I think about it, the less eager I am to finger the ''secret
state''. Len Murray, whose moving tribute to his old colleague last week
was good reading, is healthily sceptical: it is hard to credit that we
live in a land where awkward politicians are liquidated. And McRae --
who, it is now evident, had multiple problems at the time of his death
-- was scarcely a figure threatening British civilisation as we know it.
No proof has emerged that he carried nuclear secrets: only conveniently
anonymous claims by unspecified ''friends''.
Claims have emerged that McRae was under Special Branch surveillance.
But such sources have good reasons, I think, for wanting us to believe
it. Even if McRae was being trailed, I must be heretical: such
surveillance could have been justified. For public safety alone, Special
Branch could rightly have shadowed McRae if they thought he could have
led them to certain desperadoes. Chilling as the Prevention of Terrorism
Act is, its provisions exist to protect us all from random bombing and
bloodshed.
That Special Branch officers, however, could cold-bloodedly murder a
declining political figure I find incredible. If they killed him, it
would have been by ''accident''. Perhaps McRae stopped and challenged
them. Maybe he produced his gun. There could have been a ''scene'';
things rapidly getting out of hand . . .
I have my own scenario for McRae's death. But it does not involve the
secret state and, while it indicates homicide, I doubt if it would be
defined as murder in the full legal sense. For now, I plan quietly to
investigate various lines; I have a book well advanced on the case, and
no immediate plans for further revelations in The Herald.
A final warning. I have been told that, after 10 years, the Crown
Office could now destroy all its papers on the McRae case -- which is,
after all, officially closed. I will say this. If it ever emerges that
the file no longer exists, that it has been burned or shredded -- then,
without hesitation, I will reveal what papers I have seen, where and
when I saw them, who showed them to me, what position that person held,
what position that person held in the spring of 1985, and what role that
person played in inquiries into the strange death of Willie McRae.
I simply do not understand a close relative wanting to believe that
the sudden death of a loved one was self-inflicted

LONDON has not been going loco over Scotland's favourite scul?tor.
George Wyllie has been enjoying the irony of being snubbed by
Architect's Journal magazine.
When the mag organised a centenary bash in Islington it featured
Glasgow's Big Model, the eye-catching promotional sculpture which graced
Princes Square during the campaign to win the City of Architecture and
Design title. However, the sculpture went to London without the model of
Wyllie's famous straw locomotive which had been specially made to hang
from a representation of the Finnieston crane -- as his original straw
locomotive hung from the real crane before he spectacularly torched it.
Instead, a rather insipid replacement, Mr Happy, hung from the
sculpture during its London sojourn.
Part of the reason for this is that the city, while owning the
sculpture, does not own Wylie's model. City architect Chris Purslow had
balked at the cost of having it made and it was commissioned by
consultant Neil Baxter at his own expense.
The model straw loco has, however, been much admired by other
colleagues of Purslow at the council, including the director of art
galleries and museums Julian Spalding. He has offered Baxter more than
four times the price he paid the scul?tor, a fact which amuses Wyllie no
end. ''It was easier to make the big one than the wee one but if Neil
wants to sell it to Julian Spalding we'll split the profits and I'll
make him another one,'' he responds with an entrepreneurial glint in his
eye.
Rude evening
LOOK, we're not saying that the people at Scottish Branch of the
Chartered Institute of Housing are an unfriendly bunch but we suspect
they ain't about to let their hair down during their May outing to
Dundee.
In fact, they probably won't even brush their hair. Or brush their
teeth for that matter. Or wash under their arms. Indeed, it's almost
certainly going to be a case of the ''you'll have had your clootie
dumpling then'' when the professional housing folk rendezvous at
Dundee's Discovery Point for their ''Anti-Social Evening'', which they
will no doubt spend spitting at one another and sticking spinach in
their teeth.
The evening's invitation points out that a cross-section of members
are expected to attend but it seems likely that the noised-off, arrogant
and downright rude sections will put in an appearance too. Gatecrashers
are not expected.
Smells a bit off
GLASGOW smells better? Appearances are obviously in the nasal passage
of the beholder. Tom Lang, a lecturer at Langside College, set his
Higher English students the task of using all their senses to evoke a
foreign place.
One of his students from Spain, Mercedes de Castillo, responded by
writing about the Dear Green Place. ''Glasgow,'' she wrote, ''smells to
me like delicious brown bread fried in egg and red wine.'' The Dairy
agrees with the fried egg element but disputes the rest of the olfactory
lyricism; we reckon that that special whiff in the air is more a pan
bread and lager kind of experience.
Water laugh
PLAYING the names game are Mr David Spittle, chairman of Glenrothes'
Related Fluids Company, and the engineer at Haden Fire Protection, the
not very reassuringly monikered Mr J Flood.
Warning note
SPOTTED in last week's Hamilton Advertiser -- an advertisement for
Sandylands Caravan Park which gives new depths to the twentieth century
curse of built-in obsolence. The Land of Sandy business is clearly
upfront about this phenomenon, boasting about fully sited caravan homes
for under two grand but warning perhaps in a guilt-stricken post-script
kind of way, that ''they DO NOT last long''. Just in case you thought
that was the retirement home sorted.
* WHILE playing Scotland as part of his Pulp Fiction inspired national
tour, Dick 'Miserlou' Dale and his band took in some of the sights.
Despite adhering to the kind of New Age lifestyle so beloved of
Californian rockers the guys are one mean-looking bunch of hombres, all
leather jackets and swagger, and so were somewhat astounded to find
themselves being sniggered at by a bunch of tourists while perusing
Edinburgh Castle. The object for the onlookers amusement was the
astounding resemblance of Dale's bass player Ron Eglit to the portrait
he was standing beneath, one Charles II. The ringletted one immediately
blanched and hid behind his hair (not too tough a task), admitted it was
a fair cop but, bizarrely for an American, denied any family connection
to the British royals.

SPRING will be a different shape this year, and has been for long
enough without a song being made of it, because of Edward Budding.
Because of him the season is greener. And to spring he added much sweat.
Edward Budding invented the lawnmower.
There might be a lot less grass about but for him. Without a machine
to crop their paddocks, urban homesteaders would go off their gardens.
Concrete and crazy paving would be more the style. Cities could have
taken a different shape.
If every blade of green stuff had to be cut by hand, urban settlers
would have rested in the evening rather than create a God's half-acre
around their door. The idea that gardening is next to godliness might
never have caught on.
As much as anybody, Edward Budding, a good name for him, brought the
country to town. More than just shear grass, he shaped lives.
About now is a good time to bless his name. Either that or to blame
him for much backache. And since it is not possible to meet the man
(which is usually the case with the inventors of really important things
of everyday living), then to pay some mind to his machine.
Besides, finding out about his mower is one way to delay hauling your
own beast from its winter quarters.
If the notion that mowing meadows in the ancient way with scythes
needed to be improved had failed to occur to Edward Budding, it would
have blossomed in somebody else's mind, or so you'd think. Technological
progress would have seen to it, except that there was no sign that it
would.
Ed Budding has the first mower all to himself. Nobody else has claimed
to have been working along similar lines at the same time as him. He was
all on his own. In fact, even he was not interested. What Budding had in
mind was something else entirely. Replacing the scythe did not come into
it.
At a textile factory at Stroud, Gloucestershire, Edward Bleach Budding
had set out to make a machine that would do the chore of snipping off
the knobbly bits from new heavy woollen cloth.
He seems then to have decided it was too much hassle. Exactly what was
the crunch has not been chronicled. Maybe the Luddites, who went about
wrecking any new labour-saving gadgets they could get their hands on,
were active around Stroud.
Anyhow, Edward Budding decided to forget it, except he couldn't. He
reshaped his idea and took it to a local ironworks. So in l830 was born
the lawnmower, although not called that. ''Machinery for the purpose of
cropping or shearing the vegetable surface of lawns'' became its sales
pitch.
Hardly anybody wanted to know. One model was sold to the gardener at a
zoo for 10 guineas. A lighter model, at seven guineas, designed for
country gentlemen, hardly shifted.
It took 40 years, and the growth not so much of grass but of lawn
tennis, before the world put its hand to Budding's machine.
A muckle brute, it worked with a chain from a roller at the back. It
must have been noisy, although less so than modern machines which from
next week will make summer gardens sound like aero-engine works.
Budding's problem was that cutting grass was seen as toil for
peasants. Users of scythes had been groundlings. They were not proper
gardeners, just rough hands. Selling to toffy customers was another
market.
Manufacturers had to convince owners of small prairies of grassland
that keeping it trim was a genteel activity. Hence the pricing in
guineas. Mower adverts show the pusher dressed in posh clothes, wearing
a lum hat and with his shoes polished.
Budding went further. He hinted that mowing was more fun than it
looked. It was too enjoyable to be left to hired help. He suggested:
''Country gentlemen may find in using my machine themselves an amusing,
useful, and healthy exercise.''
Amusing Queen Victoria was a Scottish contribution to making trim
lawns fashionable and a symbol of respectability.
Ten years after Budding an Arbroath designer, Alexander Shanks,
introduced a pony-drawn mower that swept up its clippings. Victoria at
Balmoral became an enthusiastic buyer.
Then as now, opinion remained divided about whether a finely shorn
lawn brought a piece of heaven to earth.
For mowers was a remarkable lady called Jane Loudon, a gardening
writer and novelist. Her fiction included a romance set in the century
after next in which she predicted air travel and gas fires, not to
mention the telephone.
With her feet more on the ground, Mrs Loudon wrote 20 books on
horticulture. She was a founder member of a publishing industry that has
deforested more hillsides than golf courses. To other lady gardeners she
recommended mowing to keep fit. To her a mower was an exercise machine.
She wrote: ''It is particularly adapted for amateurs, affording
excellent exercise to the arms and every part of the body.''
Another green-fingered guru of early-Budding days disagreed. He was
William Robinson, a wild Irishman who bought himself a country mansion
from the profits of his gardening magazines.
He preferred countless flowers to a close-cut sward. ''We want shaven
carpets of grass here and there,'' Robinson conceded. ''But what
nonsense it is to shave it as often as foolish men shave their faces,''
he added, leaving no more about mowers to be said.

SARAH Villiers's review of Speed-The-Plow at the Ramshorn claimed that
the actors Thomas Gemmell and Nav Lancio ''impersonated'' the
performances of Vincent Friel and Robert De Nero respectively.
We would just like to point out that we were endeavouring to
''impersonate'' Michelle Pfeiffer and Ronnie Corbett (respectively).
We apologise for any inconvenience caused.
In our next production we will try to ''impersonate'' theatre critics.

''ARTISTS seek legal advice over band's use of work'' was the rather
contentious headline on an article by Keith Bruce (March 24). Two
artists were mentioned in the article, namely Mr Ian Hughes and Mr Ron
O'Donnell.
Having discussed the matter directly with both artists (and being in
receipt of a letter from Mr Hughes addressed to Keith Bruce), I am
assured that neither Ron nor Ian have, as suggested, sought legal
advice. They would have no reason to.
Additionally, the article states: '' . . . their work, which is being
used and displayed without their knowledge . . . ''
Mr Bruce actually asked me at a Wet Wet Wet Art Exhibition the night
before (located in the splendour of the banqueting hall of Glasgow City
Chambers) whether, indeed, this was or was not the case. I assured him
in no uncertain terms it was not.
Let's talk about the art exhibition because, quite frankly, if you
lived in Scotland and you blinked or, indeed, you happened to miss the
Scotland Today transmission, then you probably would not have been aware
of its existence. On the other hand, the English film crews covered the
art exhibition beautifully, from the O Zone TV programme, from MTV and,
yes, even from London Tonight.
The art project is a magnificent statement in anyone's term. Fifty
pieces of work by 20 Scottish artists touring Europe in 11 locations
(Hennie Onstad Kunst Senter, Oslo; Arnolds, Stockholm; City Chambers,
Glasgow; Pakhus, Copenhagen; Berko, Brussels; El Taller, Madrid; Luis
Gampana, Cologne; Evoluon, Eindhoven; Vauxhall St Peter's Gothic
Heritage Church, London; Le Monde De L'Art, Paris; and in Italy -- venue
TBC).
Thus, some well-known and some lesser known Scottish artists will have
the opportunity to exhibit their work in all these locations in all
these cities and, with the attendant publicity, will hopefully receive a
tremendous boost to their careers. I know some very definitely already
have. Half a dozen have told me personally, others have intimated same
to my PA.
I thank the artists profusely for their enthusiasm for the project,
for their commitment and their talent. I thank Wet Wet Wet for having
the foresight to offer up this unique music and art interactive
opportunity and I thank The Herald (in advance) for having the decency
to print this letter.
The truth will out.

THE Scots are either princes (and, of course, princesses) or paupers.
Politicians and economists keep telling us so. But which is it to be?
In fact, Ian Lang sometimes tells us it is both. In some circumstances
he boasts of the economic miracle over which he presides, fondly quoting
the fact that Scotland now exports more per capita than Japan.
At other times, most usually when he detects the whiff of
constitutional change in the air, he tells us that only the munificence
of our English partners in the Union keeps the chill wind off our backs
and the wolf from the door.
He said it starkly in a statement issued at 00.01 hours on February
12, by sheer coincidence the day of the televised debate on Scotland's
constitutional future between George Robertson and Alex Salmond.
''Labour's Scottish parliament,'' he said -- note the psychological
belittlement in not capitalising the ''p'' and the dismissal of the
Liberal Democrats' part in the plan -- ''would have serious financial
problems from day one that could only be solved by taxing the Scottish
people heavily.''
He then rehearsed the figures -- 8.8% of the UK population raise only
8.3% of income tax, national insurance, VAT and local revenue, but
receive 10% of identifiable expenditure, ''so we raise less than our
population share and spend more''.
At least that statement had the honesty of coming on Conservative
Party headed paper. The last time the Scottish Secretary played this
game of statistical politics, he did so by the much more dubious means
of getting his civil servants to publish them for him just before the
last General Election in a report entitled Government Expenditure and
Revenue in Scotland.
And so the claims and counter-claims rumble on. For the SNP, we are
the 21st richest nation on earth, our natural resources plundered to pay
hidden subsidies to someone else's Home Counties. For the Tory Party
chairman in London, we are a favoured minority.
For the Scottish Liberal Democrats, we are paying our way in Britain.
Their figures last week, gleaned from the House of Commons library,
showed the Government's tax-raising figures to be selective and
understated, with Scotland's contribution to the Exchequer actually
higher than our population share if an appropriate 85% contribution from
the North Sea is counted in.
At this point we throw open the door and find strange fellows
occupying the same bed, with Fraser of Allander Institute economist Jim
Stevens, who is a member of the Labour Party's Scottish executive,
snuggling up to Ian Lang, figuratively speaking.
Stevens's figures are actually slightly more pessimistic on Scotland's
budget deficit. Excluding oil and gas receipts, he had us raising 8.2%
of revenue while going through 10.3% of identifiable expenditure. Even
including oil (a two-thirds share in his calculation) brings Scottish
revenue up to only 8.6%.
On the identifiable expenditure side, he claims the Government's
figures were broadly accurate, with per capita spending in Scotland at
1.16 times the UK level. In fairness to Stevens, he says that the entire
public accounting process should be made more transparent so we can see
how figures are arrived at.
Given to stating his position with a refreshing bluntness, Stevens --
who, unusually in Labour circles these days, does not flinch from
referring to himself as a Unionist -- marshalls the figures as a caution
against separatism, not devolution. The threat by London to cut spending
in Scotland is not dependent on constitutional change, he points out. It
could happen at any time.
He rightly adds that fooling ourselves about the existing position is
not a suitable precursor to informed debate about future options. He
also argues that whatever claims are made about hidden subsidies to the
South, the existing cash deficit reflects actual services being provided
in Scotland which would have to be either cut or paid for in the event
of independence.
However, with apt timing, another economic model has been constructed,
with very different conclusions. Malcolm Slesser and David Crane of the
Centre for Human Ecology at Edinburgh University use a process called
natural capital accounting, which maps human activity against natural
resources and the environment.
Using this model they have run a projection of a future in which from
the year 2000 Scotland assumes control of its own oil and gas revenues.
It is, they say, ''a cautionary tale indeed'', as an initial
multi-billion-pound balance of payments surplus could so stimulate the
economy and consumer spending as to plunge the country back into the red
a decade later.
But they say that properly governed, there is no reason why an
independent Scotland could not prosper, with substantial room for
manoeuvre to ease poor house insulation, poor public transport,
inadequate pensions and declining employment.
''We know from the few explorations we have already made of the
post-2001 situation that a better sustainable future can be generated
for Scotland if there is a canny hand on the tiller.''
In contrast to the hot air of the economic threats which have been
employed in the constitutional debate so far, they concede that Scotland
is not more disadvantaged than other parts of the UK, and in contrast to
the case for self-determination the economic argument is ''sterile and
irrelevant''.
What oil revenues would give is an initial breathing space to improve
Scotland's infrastructure to cope with existence on the geographical
periphery of Europe in an age when there will no longer be work for
everyone who wants it.
Their conclusion will be music to SNP ears: ''Scotland could stand on
its own well enough, but with each passing barrel of oil that valuable
initial impetus of a surplus will be diminished.''

IF there is one thing which unites male politicians of whatever
tendency it is this herdish instinct to patronise the same tailor.
Crumpled on all sides, the universal suit casts a long and dismal shadow
over Westminster. It matters not whether it is pinstripe, chalk stripe,
charcoal, or navy blue because from every angle it gives off an
emblematic greyness, a greyness which, above all, is a state of mind.
Here it comes trudging out of Downing Street in weary fashion on the
back of Mr Major only to bolt back in again, over-stretched, on Mr
Clarke. Some hours later it appears settled in a chair at the Opposition
leader's office, sprucer certainly but then everything about Mr Blair
suggests he comes equipped with a smoothing iron in his portmanteau. And
now Jonathan Aitken is wearing it as he stands on that interview lawn
outside the Commons. Dressed for the television news, he demonstrates
the suit's superior manner, as if it seeks distance from the brashness
of new money double-breasteds by indulging in the pedigree buttonholes
of Savile Row. Even so, he might just as well have purchased his
two-piece from M &amp; S for all the visual impact it achieves.
What Mr Aitken and the rest are wearing, of course, is a uniform
which, for generations, has signalled authority and status. But the fact
is any stranger, closing his ears while gazing down on Commons business
from the visitors' gallery, must sometimes wonder if he hasn't landed in
on a convention of undertakers. Indeed there are moments when the Beast
of Bolsover appears to be the only man who demonstrates any measure of
costume variety. A Red and hairy man, Dennis Skinner is a bit of a
period piece now, that black and white pebble-dash jacket redolent of
the defunct Co-op manager, circa 1980.
But lo, swinging into view, just a few inches above Mr Major's head
during Prime Minister's questions, we spot an item of neckwear, gorgeous
as a Kandinsky, among the greater crested ties on either side. Not a
static thing, this tie leaps about, flapping approval of its leader,
then leans towards a neighbour in an exchange of information, and
finally appears to slacken into a post-prandial siesta. Meanwhile the
identity of its wearer remains a secret, just out of eyeshot of the
camera. Since that first appearance 14 days ago there has been no repeat
performance. Arriving with the brightness and suddenness of a premature
hyacinth, this spring tie probably perished in an overnight frost.
What is to be done about this oppressive throng? The late Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn, that self-made dandy, did his best to enliven the Commons,
but to no avail. In fact a small but fascinating insight into British
inverted snobbery manifests itself every time some male politician
attempts to shed the clothes of convention. For instance, anyone turning
up at Westminster in a brown suit these days is written off by both the
Tories and latter-day Labour as an unreconstructed Trotskyite with
dandruff and suede shoes.
In his leadership days Mr Kinnock did not fare much better when he
faced the Government in his infamous lightweight which looked as if it
had been put together from discarded dusters. Somehow that pale suit
robbed him of any shred of gravitas to make him seem only shifty. And it
probably cost him a General Election, just as Michael Foot's donkey
jacket and general air of fashion chaos had done before. Unlike French
and German politicians, who have no difficulty whatever in openly
espousing style, British party members affect a disregard for fashion,
implying that any close attention to clothes is somehow linked to
reduced intelligence and fly-by-night integrity.
This last notion is particularly self-deluding, for if anything has
soiled the reputation of the orthodox city suit in recent years it has
been the city's own sharp practice and the sleazy incompetence which
characterises our sober-suited rulers.
According to polls undertaken by the menswear industry, the
best-dressed male politicians in Britain are Sir Patrick Mayhew with his
six-button cuffs and aura of hand-stitching, and Michael Heseltine who
includes power eyebrows among his accessories. The worst dressed is Roy
Hattersley, the industrial slump incarnate. But for our money John
Prescott is the only man whose sense of style is really worth watching.
There is a glorious rawness to it which should be accompanied by a fat
Havana. He is the one whose worsteds, among many, possess the daytime
chutzpah of a nightclub proprietor. Mr Prescott may wear pinstripes
today to signal allegiance to the Club, but he is still a magnificent
walking rejection of the image-maker's mischief.

I'M all for reviewers making their own art lively but not at the
expense of assaulting the integrity of a theatre company. Over
two-thirds of Sara Villiers's review of Speed-the-plow at the Ramshorn
Theatre states that STG has stolen performances from other people (March
29).
This is untrue -- neither the director nor the actors concerned had
seen the performance she cites. As a theatre director, and director of a
venue, I take my chances on reviewers not liking what they have seen. I
do not expect that the good name of my theatre and its in-house company
should be smeared in this way.
Vincent Friel might be flattered to know that his empathy with Mamet
is celebrated by the critic, or he might well be embarrassed to be
dragged into a misrepresentation of the work of colleagues. Even the
most rudimentary reading of a text by Mamet would show the power of the
author's voice in the text, and it is this voice that determines the
origin and shape of performances. The director and actors were true to
this voice: that does not seem to me something to complain about.
This is not simply a matter of interpretation. Many people have
started their careers in Scottish theatre, film, TV and arts
administration through STG and the Drama Centre. Many other people are
keen to see our productions. The Herald is the leading paper helping to
form opinion in the West of Scotland. Our livelihoods and careers are on
the line here.

THE sad saga of absentee land-ownership on Eigg prompts the
fundamental question -- when will Government enshrine the rights of the
resident population with control over their most basic resources, the
land, the sea, and the air?
Sir Russell Johnston vented his frustration by calling for the
Government ''to take such fragile communities (like Eigg) into public
ownership''. Why stop there?
Isn't that what the Tory Government did in Glendale and Liberal
Governments did in creating the DAFS crofting estates? Isn't that the
bane of British Coal tenants whose farms on nationalised land are now
being sold under their feet to the highest bidder when Government policy
changes?
Informed opinion has moved on and Community land trusts, like the
Assynt Crofters and township limited companies like Borve, are the new
models. Alongside these developments we must put a stop to the sale of
huge blocks of Scottish land on the speculative international market,
once and for all.
Above all the real prize for this and subsequent generations is to
reclaim our land for sustainable habitation by the many and to curb the
untrammelled land-owning power of the few.

BRITISH industry will never pull together as a co-ordinated,
efficient, and loyal workforce while the present executive pay and
performance formula pertains.
A company has problems created by inefficient executives, employees
lose their jobs, the company is that much weaker and these same
executives walk away with six-figure pay-offs. In no time at all they
are back in another executive post and the merry-go-round starts again.
I have yet to meet an American executive with even a one-year
contract, never mind three or five. One day seems to be the norm.
However, they are highly paid, have exacting performance targets and, if
successful, receive all the perks of success. Fall down on the job and
you're out -- immediately and generally without compensation.
Surely there must be a way in which high salaries can be linked to
their company share price. You cannot pay a successful executive too
much but equally it is quite inequitable to reward failure. Share price
must be the best measure of performance.
Indeed, is there any reason why middle-management and shop-floor wages
and salaries cannot be linked to the same yardstick? No improvement in
share price, no wage increase -- to anyone.
I doubt that we can look to either the CBI or the Institute of
Directors for investigation and action along these lines. Might I
suggest that the press takes up the task and brings public opinion to
bear?
We have a great number of excellent executives and senior managers in
this country who are certainly not overpaid. Unfortunately we never hear
of them but only of the ever-increasing number of failed executives and
their excessive golden handshakes.

THE closing of the Dawson Group's knitwear factory in Arbroath, and
the carpet yarn spinning plant in Kilwinning, while devastating for the
employees involved, is but the latest chapter in a despairing catalogue
of closures in the UK textile and clothing industry.
Whatever reasons emanate from management or Government for
restructuring or rationalisation of this now decimated industry, the
truth is that the unrestricted imports from cheap producing countries in
the Far East are the core cause.
It is widely recognised that Far Eastern carpet manufacturers employ
child labour, and that clothing manufacturing units impose working
conditions not legally permitted in Arbroath or Kilwinning.
Having spent almost 40 years in the textile and clothing industry, at
home and abroad, I conclude that while the UK Government draws short of
introducing child labour, or an 80-hour working week, it adopts the
alternative course of allowing our home industry to die and allowing
manufacturers, wholesalers, and large retail outlets to contract out to
cheap producing countries.
Those who thought that a Free Trade policy would improve living
conditions for Third World countries might now reflect that all it has
achieved is to impoverish thousands of our own workforce.
My travels to European Union countries reveal they have not followed
the suicidal import policies of the UK. Surely it is time for a rethink.

WILLIAM McRae was a man of profound principle, and I recall all too
well when he loudly interrupted a speech I was making at a national
conference when he felt I was being less than honest in my arguments.
In the bitter disillusionment and demoralisation that gripped Scotland
in the early years of the Thatcher tyranny a small number of people on
the nationalist margins felt that democratic political processes were
useless against the might of the British state.
A number of arrests were made on several occasions on security
grounds; the shaky and occasionally specious legal basis for these
arrests was well illustrated by the fact that McRae was invariably able
to secure release from custody fairly quickly.
These activities, as your articles indicated, resulted in his being
placed under Special Branch surveillance. However, in a state which
admits to having two million of its population under some sort of
security classification there is little unusual or significant about
that.
McRae made what was I believe the fatal error that sealed his fate
when he circulated a letter admitting that as a young officer in the
British Armed Forces in India he leaked intelligence information to the
Indian nationalists, information that may well have advanced the
liberation struggle in that land.
John Macleod has done an enormous service to Scotland by blasting this
issue wide open again. I am not being in the least facetious when I
recommend that he does not drive alone at night around remote Highland
roads.

ANNE Simpson's article on the recent encyclical from the Vatican
(Evangelium Vitae) shows a lack of knowledge on the social teaching of
the Catholic Church (March 31). This lack of knowledge or
misunderstanding is all too common in secular journalism.
The Church has akways been compassionate to women who have had
abortions. The errant journalists need only refer to John's Gospel,
chapter 8, where a woman caught in adultery is brought before Jesus by
the then errant scribes (and Pharisees).
Jesus forgives that woman without condoning the sin with the words,
''neither do I condemn you . . . go away and sin no more''.
Likewise with abortion. The Church has always condemned the sin and
not the sinner and has always encouraged its members to do the same.
Like the majority of Catholics, I welcome the reaffirmation of the
Church's stance on abortion, IVF, embryo experimentation, artificial
contraception, and euthanasia. I am glad that the Vatican has conformed
its position over capital punishment as well. Pope John Paul II and the
Catholic Church will appear intolerant to most secular eyes. It is
intolerant to sin.

JOHN Digney's radical viewpoint is clearly based on limited knowledge
and dated vision, and is one from which Scotland's many responsible
landowners and land managers will differ (March 23).
The other side of the equation is that the well-managed, traditional
private estate provides Scotland with the best form of land management,
and its continuance and protection is the only sensible way forward for
this vital aspect of Scotland's rural economy.
The benefits of private ownership far outweigh any alternative.
Private ownership generates long-term, responsible decisions taken for
the good of those living and working in rural areas. It generates a
spirit of enterprise and innovation resulting in farm and business
tenancies and increased opportunities for rural employment.
It fosters conservation and safeguards natural and built heritage. It
is at the heart of generating new opportunities for the use of the
countryside for public recreation and leisure.
The Scottish Landowners' Federation, representing around 4000 of
Scotland's land owners, is working successfully with the Government and
its agencies (on uplands land-use practices, for example) to develop
policies for the long-term good of the Scottish rural economy.
We advocate the promotion of high standards of management and use of
land, and ensure that legislation and policy affecting landownership and
use is prepared with proper consideration not just for the rights and
responsibilities of the landowners, but also the well-being of rural
communities, the environment, and the wider public interest.
Not only do landowners provide the land, they also continued
investment in terms of time, money, enthusiastic management, and much
more besides.

THE Chancellor Kenneth Clarke will face pressure today to outline a
three-year programme of rolling tax cuts in the autumn Budget when he
meets the Conservative back-bench finance committee.
With Tory MPs seeking ways to save the party from an electoral rout,
the suggestion that a promise to slash taxes to 20p in the pound, in a
phased three-stage reduction, has found growing favour. Conservative
chairman Jeremy Hanley became the first Cabinet Minister to endorse such
a move at the weekend.
Observers believe the proposal owes more to political than economic
realities. The think tanks, from both right and left, agree such a
programme would need a further round of reductions in public spending.
Social security cuts, job losses in the Civil Service and local
government, and a continuing lid on public-sector pay are identified as
the likely areas for spending curbs.
Mr Clarke is reported to be resisting the move. One City analyst says
the Chancellor's caution springs from fears that such a promise would
send the wrong signals to the City. If you put too much money back into
the economy it would create inflationary pressure:
''Too much too soon could create an element of panic in the City. They
might regard Government as losing control because of electoral anxiety.
The result would be a run on the pound which would force the Chancellor
towards a hike in interest rates. The Chancellor has to be extremely
careful about the signals he sends.''
This may also explain the refusal by Employment Secretary Michael
Portillo to be drawn on the wisdom of a pre-announced tax-cutting
programme although he continues to favour tax cuts over spending on
public services.
But the back benchers see tax cuts as the trump card needed to win
over alienated voters. Since 1992, the average taxpayer has paid out an
extra seven pence in the pound in tax.
The argument from those influential Tory MPs who want dramatic
measures to slash the basic rate of income tax is that improved economic
growth and a further pruning of public spending should be used to make a
specific commitment to regain voters' trust.
They point to Treasury receipts which they say are set to rise at #6
billion a year, enough to allow a three-pence cut this year, according
to Mr David Shaw, a leading right-wing officer of the committee:
''Growth in the economy gives us easily enough money to do it. I don't
think we have to look for big cuts in the public sector to produce the
three-pence reduction.''
So how would it be done? And where would the scythe on public spending
fall?
Economists agree that the social security budget, which continues to
grow, would have to be the major target. Education and health are
regarded as too politically sensitive with voters. Cynically, those on
social security do not have the clout of the health or education lobbies
and neither are they prime voting fodder for the Conservatives.
While revolt over education cuts in England has lost the Government
crucial support among middle-class English voters, and making inroads
into the health budget might be seen as even more politically damaging,
the argument runs that social security is a softer target.
That seems to be echoed in Mr Shaw's goals: ''We've already achieved
changes on disability allowances and to the job-seekers allowance. All
of these are moving in the right direction,'' he says.
''I think that we are beginning to see some levelling off of social
security growth. There are areas of expenditure that people don't want
to see touched -- education and health.
''The longer-term aspects of social security involve raising the
question of whether people can make private provision -- although that's
not something to be done in the next one or two or three years. I think
people are beginning to look and question whether certain groups should
be on social welfare.''
He also believes there is massive scope within Government to make
swingeing cuts: ''There is over-employment in many areas of Government.
They should look at British industry which is involved in de-layering
management. My feeling is that there's a lot more that could be done to
reduce numbers working in local government and the Civil Service. These
combined with increased efficiencies and savings to be made by extending
contracting out and competitive tendering are areas where savings could
be made.''
His argument is mirrored by Dr Madsen Pirie at the right-wing Adam
Smith Institute who claims millions could be saved by preventing fraud
on the social security system. Enough to sustain tax cuts of 3p in the
pound?
''Don't knock it. The social security budget is #90 billion which is
40% of all our spending. Eliminate fraud and you could save hundreds of
millions.''
Dr Pirie believes the three-year programme would be a simple reversal
of recent moves to phase in taxes, for instance when VAT on fuel was set
at progressively higher levels. ''You increase predictability. People
will know in advance what income tax they will be charged and can plan
their spending accordingly.''
However, Andrew Delnot, at the centre-left think tank, the Institute
of Fiscal Studies, derides Dr Pirie's argument on social security fraud,
pointing out that if there were massive savings to be made they would
have been easy pickings in previous rounds of spending cuts.
''It's disingenuous to pretend there's a free lunch somewhere out
there. If that level of fraud really existed, you would think that after
16 years we would be going after it. It's avoiding the main issue.''
Mr Delnot says the call for a rolling programme of tax cuts is a
confusion of political and economic arguments. He accepts that the
economy has grown more quickly than expected but believes there is a
flaw in the argument that says economic growth will continue at the
current level of around 4%.
He also believes it is extremely difficult to identify large areas of
public spending which remain to be slashed: ''I am cautious. I have been
surprised by the extent to which public spending has been held back. But
it gets increasingly difficult. The truth is cutting public spending by
any significant amount would mean taking extremely hard decisions.
''We can't avoid the main issue which is that we can't continue to cut
taxes and spending, even if you can for a little while. History suggests
there is a limited period in which you can do that.''
Gerald Frost of the the Centre for Policy Studies, the Thatcherite
think-tank, inclines to the view that a three-year programme would tie
the Chancellor's hands:
''It would mean making a commitment to reduce taxes over a given
timescale which will involve implications for public spending. It has an
obvious appeal to the taxpayer, but it would perhaps tie the hands of a
Chancellor who might have to deal with unforeseen problems which would
force him either to reverse the commitment or alter the timing.''
Another political argument against the suggestion holds that voters
have notoriously short memories. Announce tax cuts now and they will
take them for granted when they appear three years hence, thus lessening
the beneficial impact.
Other more sceptical observers point out that while the Government is
keen to focus on the basic rate of income tax, what is important for
taxpayers is the threshold on which they pay it, the levels of personal
allowances, because it is that which determines how much of their income
is taxed. As economic recovery gets people off benefit and back into
work, the amount of tax take increases:
''It is the activity in the economy that determines how much you take
in in tax revenue,'' said an Edinburgh tax consultant. ''It is the
number of people paying tax that matters, and it is that which people
fail to grasp.''
Too much too soon could create an element of panic in the City. They
might regard Government as losing control because of electoral anxiety

Three months have come and gone, political crises have developed and
been defused, banks have crashed and fortunes have been made and lost.
Smiling through it all have been the five babies on this page -- our
Five for '95. They brought in the New Year with Herald readers and are
now three months wiser, and taking in the wonders of the world through
wide and intelligent eyes. It is a particularly charming stage in a
baby's life, when the parent's initial panic has started to wear off and
a full appreciation of their child's generous joy is possible. Jennifer
Cunningham reports on their progress and will continue to keep readers
informed in regular updates.
CHRISTOPHER McGuire likes nothing better than a good giggle with his
Grandad. Every morning, Ronald Nardone, still convalescing from a heart
attack 18 months ago, visits his daughter Joanna and grandson
Christopher for a game of pulling monster faces while Mum gets on with
the housework in their 15th-storey flat in East Kilbride.
''We're on the list for a house now and it usually takes about a year,
so we hope that by the time he's walking we'll have a garden,'' said
Joanna.
Her first mother's day was also her 27th birthday, so they had a
special celebration. She has been out for a few girls' nights with
husband Alexander's colleagues, leaving Dad to babysit, and has also
kept in touch with her own workmates and is planning to return to work
in July.
Christopher is making perfect progress, now 13lb 6oz and sleeping from
10pm to 8.30am.
Towards a bright future
In just 12 weeks, Diana Henderson has shown that a new baby brings out
the best in everyone. When she was born in Glasgow Royal Maternity
Hospital, her mum and dad, Brenda and Barry, were living in
accommodation for the homeless in Bishopbriggs. Now they have a flat in
Milton of Campsie filled to overflowing with soft toys and baby clothes.
Grandparents, friends and the local councillor, have rallied round to
help the new family set up home. Young Diana sleeps for the best part of
12 hours every night, but Barry and Diana are sometimes still up at 2am
decorating. They are hoping to get a three-piece suite soon as the
finishing touch to their living room, papered in a soft burgundy colour.
''It was hard going at first,'' they both admit, but now that she
sleeps until nine o'clock most mornings, life is looking up. Brenda has
entrusted her to her friend down the road a couple of times to allow
them out.
Diana was 11lbs at the last weigh-in and is growing beautiful golden
hair to match her mum's and has had her first taste of solid food. They
are planning to have her christened in the next month or so and she
already has a white lacy dress.
Sleep at last
* BLAIR Walker is good as gold, alternately grinning at the camera and
staring with puzzled brown eyes. Mum Frances says candidly that the
first six weeks of his life were a nightmare of exhaustion, despite dad
George doing the feeding and changing during the night for the first
three weeks until he returned to work. Second-time mums are confident,
practical -- and honest.
''Every time I got him settled and sat down with a cup of tea, Lewis
would demand a drink of milk. Just five days after Blair's birth, big
brother Lewis was three. This year, Frances was thankful to leave the
party to the nursery where Lewis goes three days a week.
After six weeks, life became calmer and recently young Blair has been
sleeping from 11pm until 8.30am.''I feel as if I am back to normal at
last,'' said Frances.
Last week she got a nasty shock when told the insurance job she is
planning to go back to will be moved to Stirling as part of a general
re-structuring by Scottish Amicable. '' I really want to go back to work
instead of being in the house all day, but it will mean getting a train
at 7.25 in the morning. It will be very difficult to get two small
children ready by that time, so I have asked if I might be able to work
shorter hours. I am not quite sure what will happen.'' Granny Walker
helps out a lot, taking Lewis to and from nursery and Frances sister has
had both boys to stay overnight to give mum and dad some sleep.
It's such a whirl the second time around
AT A giant family gathering in Wigan, Rebecca Watkin was christened
last weekend in a double ceremony with her cousin Ryan. Grannies,
grandads, even step-grandparents, aunts, uncles and godmothers were all
there for the buffet lunch -- followed at night by a party to celebrate
dad Jonathan's 30th birthday.
Normally, outings for Rebecca and mum, Adele, revolve around big
brother Joshua's social whirl: playgroup and exchange visits with other
big chaps of three. Rebecca has taken it all in her stride.
''It is different second time round. I felt I recovered much more
quickly from the Caesarean this time, but there is just so much more to
be packed into every day,'' said Adele, who has found that a housing
estate still in the process of being built on the outskirts of Edinburgh
turns into a quagmire in the middle of winter. Going to playgroup means
either a very long walk for short legs or pushing the pram through a
grass field.
Rebecca has gained weight steadily and was 14lb 4oz at the last
weigh-in.
Perfect Pair
''I was very worried when I got home from hospital, thinking things
would start to go wrong, but gradually we got everything organised,''
said Susan Wardrope. Young Jordan, however, is the perfect baby and
Susan the perfect mother. Now tipping the scales at 12lbs 4oz, he sleeps
from 8pm until 6.30 am and has one small snooze during the day.
He and his mum are super-organised. After breakfast she makes up
enough bottles for the day while Jordan works out with a shake, rattle
and roll on the baby gym which was a present from Granny. Dad Ian has
turned out to be a dab hand with the nappies and bottles and both sets
of grandparents have babysat to allow mum and dad a precious night out.
There are other young families round about, but no other babies. Susan
says she meets other mums at the baby clinic and sometimes sees her
former colleagues for lunch. She is planning to go back to work in
Stirling after maternity leave and admits to missing her busy office
life, especially at the beginning, though she adds that she has loved
every minute of motherhood. She and Jordan spend a lot of time visiting
friends and going for walks and keeping grandparents and aunties up to
date with the newest member of a large, close family.

ABERDEEN District Council is to ask the Scottish Office if
''scanners'' can be banned in taxis to stop rogue drivers stealing
customers.
The council promised to raise the matter after the problem was
highlighted at a meeting of the City Taxi Consultative Group, made up of
councillors and representatives of the taxi trade.
The trade told how the rogue drivers are using the scanners to pick up
messages from taxi companies and how they are picking up the passengers
before the bona fide driver arrives.
The council agreed to ask the Scottish Office if it can include a
condition, when issuing licences, that scanners are banned from all
cabs.
The drivers also said they are seeking a 10% fares increase.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang has expressed reservations about a move to
change the law by fellow Conservative MP Allan Stewart, to allow the
Libyans suspected of the Lockerbie bombing to be tried under Scots law
in another country.
Mr Stewart, a former Scottish Office Minister, is to travel to Libya
on Sunday in order to discuss his plans with senior Libyan Government
officials.
As exclusively revealed in The Herald two weeks ago, the MP for
Eastwood has tabled a new clause to the Criminal Justice (Scotland)
Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would allow a Scottish
court, complete with Scottish judge and jury, to try a case abroad.
The Hague has been mentioned as a possibility.
Mr Stewart said yesterday the aim of the visit was to take steps
towards ending the existing deadlock.
Libya is still subject to a damaging embargo because it has refused to
hand over those suspected of the PanAm bombing for trial in either
Scotland or America.
However, there have been suggestions that they would be willing to go
on trial in a neutral country, which so far has not been taken up by the
West.
Mr Stewart's new clause would mean a compromise -- it would still be
Scottish justice, but would be carried out in a country acceptable to
Libya.
Mr Stewart said: ''The new clause does not compel the Secretary of
State to undertake any course of action. It simply enables him to permit
a full Scottish judge and jury trial to sit abroad, if he so decides.
''That there would be practical difficulties I do not doubt. But, in
any situation, the final decision would lie with the Secretary of State
in consultation with the Lord Advocate.''
He added that he had not, at this stage, requested a meeting with
Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi.
Mr Lang, though, was less enthusiastic about the suggestion. ''It
would be extremely complicated to set up a court outside Scotland, and
there is no guarantee that the Libyan authorities would allow the two
individuals to be tried in such a court.''
He emphasised: ''I would prefer to see a trial take place in Scotland.
I think the practical difficulties, and the lack of certain advantage,
would appear to rule it out.''
However, he said the proposed clause would be fully debated.

Brussels
THE European Commission finally lost patience with Japan over its
discrimination against Scotch whisky yesterday and announced it would
seek a legal challenge to Tokyo's liquor tax regime.
By taking the case to the new World Trade Organisation (WTO) --
successor to Gatt -- the commission is, in effect, threatening trade
sanctions unless the Japanese change their protectionist ways.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's trade commissioner, made the announcement
yesterday in Brussels when he said he had decided to consult member
states with a view to seeking a WTO ruling. This part of the process is
likely to be a formality.
Under the old Gatt regime the Japanese were held in November, 1987, to
be in breach of their obligations to stop discriminating against Scotch
and other imported spirits. The Gatt ruling was then seen as a
breakthrough for Scotch in its long campaign to break into the tough but
lucrative Japanese market.
Since then little has been done, according to the commission, which
has been prompted in its action by the Scotch Whisky Association. At the
heart of the complaint is the Japanese taxation system as applied to
schochu, a popular local white spirit which is much less heavily taxed
than whisky and whose interests are backed by a powerful lobby.
The Japanese have merely ''tinkered'' with the duty regime on schochu
and whisky, according to the commission.
Sir Leon said yesterday: ''We are seeking a relationship with Japan
which is based on co-operation and partnership. We are committed
wherever possible to seeking to resolve our differences through
discussion. In this case we have pressed the Japanese Government for a
long time to make the necessary changes to its fiscal law in order to
meet its Gatt obligations.
''But I have concluded with regret that we are unlikely to be able to
resolve our differences within a reasonable time horizon and that we
must now turn to the WTO, which is the proper forum for settling
international trade disputes.''
By seeking WTO intervention the commission is holding out the prospect
of sanctions or trade reprisals of some kind, so far unspecified,
against Japan unless the Tokyo authorities change their ways quickly.
Although Gatt was able to pronounce that the Japanese were in breach
of trade rules, it had little authority to impose any counter-measures.
Since the WTO was set up in the wake of the Gatt Uruguay Round the range
of measures open to the EU has been beefed up.
Gatt found that so-called ''like'' products such as vodka and schochu
should be taxed identically and that all distilled liquors were
''directly competitive or substitutable products'' and should be taxed
similarly so as not to afford protection to domestic production.
But, the commission complained, in Japan whisky and brandy continued
to be taxed between four and six times more heavily than schochu while
other spirits such as vodka, gin and rum had a tax rate approximately
two to three times higher than schochu.
Schochu's market share increased from 61% in 1989 to 74% last year and
was now the only distilled spirit whose sales in Japan were growing, the
commission complained.
Welcoming Sir Leon's announcement, a Scotch Whisky Association
spokesman said: ''The time for complete removal of tax discrimination in
Japan is overdue, and we are delighted that the commission is backing
the spirits industry in its demand for fair tax treatment in Japan.''

EASTENDERS actor Sid Owen shattered a beer glass on the head of an
estate agent in an unprovoked and ''loutish'' attack at a country club,
a court was told yesterday.
Mr Mark Falshaw said he was left covered with fragments of glass and
blinded by blood after Mr Owen, 22, -- who plays garage mechanic Ricky
Butcher in the BBC1 soap -- assaulted him.
Mr Owen sat impassively in the dock as his alleged victim told
Snaresbrook Crown Court that he had required treatment in hospital for a
3cms gash to his forehead after the alleged incident.
Mr Falshaw, also 22, denied defence counsel claims that he had started
the early morning violence in a fit of jealousy over a woman. He
insisted he had done nothing to provoke Mr Owen.
The actor, of Lonsdale Road, Wanstead, east London, denies wounding
with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and an alternative charge of
unlawful wounding.
Mr Nigel Lithman, prosecuting, said Mr Owen ''behaved, we say, in what
you may think was a loutish but criminal manner, culminating in him
using a beer glass as a weapon''.
He told the jury that Mr Falshaw, of Upper Park, Loughton, Essex, had
gone to the nearby Epping Forest Country Club with a couple of friends
and later met up with two girls.
While he was chatting to the girls, Mr Owen -- charged under his real
name of David John Owen -- approached the group as they stood near the
busy downstairs bar. There was an exchange of abuse between the two men,
and some pushing and shoving, said Mr Lithman.
He alleged Mr Owen then ''lost his temper and momentarily his
self-control and struck Mr Falshaw in the face with the beer glass from
which he had been drinking''.
He continued: ''Fortunately, as he did so, Mr Falshaw ducked a little
so he took the force of the blow on the top of the forehead.''
Mr Falshaw told the court he had been acquainted with Mr Owen for a
couple of years. But he maintained there had been nothing to cause any
animosity between them.
Cross-examined by Mr Oliver Blunt, QC, for the defence, Mr Falshaw
denied the four-and-a-half pints he said he may have drunk that day was
a ''modest underestimate''.
It was wrong to suggest he was drunk, he said, and insisted Mr Owen
had attacked him ''out of the blue''. He also denied a suggestion that
he had lied to the court.
He also denied that he had felt threatened or offended when the actor
began talking to one of the girls standing next to him.
Mr Blunt: ''Do you recall making a derogatory and offensive gesture
towards Mr Owen?''.
Mr Falshaw: ''Yes, it is possible, but we were swearing at each
other.''
Mr Blunt: ''Is not the position this? You took offence at Sid Owen
talking to a girl . . . and you tried to belittle him and you made an
offensive gesture. That is what happened, isn't it?''
Mr Falshaw: ''No.''
The trial continues.

Gaza, Monday
THOUSANDS defied Gaza's Palestinian Authority today and staged a
symbolic funeral in Gaza City for six Palestinians killed in a blast
yesterday.
More than 10,000 supporters of the militant Islamic group Hamas,
shouting for revenge, poured into the streets after the blast ripped
apart its alleged secret bomb factory.
Hamas has vowed ''quick, decisive, and painful'' action to avenge the
death of two of its senior figures in the explosion, which it blames on
Israel and Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
And despite a ban on demonstrations today, Hamas leaders led more than
5000 supporters from Gaza City's al-Omari mosque to a cemetery.
''We believe it was an assassination,'' said Hamas spokesman Mahmoud
al-Zahhar at the cemetery.
''Thousands of people came today to tell Israel that the people have
only one option, and that is the holy struggle until Palestine is
liberated,'' Sheik Ahmed Bahar of Hamas told the crowd during a memorial
procession for those killed.
Arafat's self-rule administration said the blast occurred when a bomb
being built by Hamas militants went off prematurely.
''They do not respect people's minds nor their security by having a
bomb factory in a housing area,'' said Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, general
secretary of the Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian police, who had vowed to prevent demonstrations, buried
the victims earlier today to prevent funerals from turning into mass
protests.
However police stayed away from the march, which ended with a rally
near the victims' fresh graves. Two of the graves were unmarked, with
signs stating ''unknown''.
The blast soured ties between Hamas and PLO leader Arafat's self-rule
authority, but officials from both sides appeared eager to play down any
long-lasting effects.
''The Palestinian Authority will not take unusual security measures,''
said Arafat aide Khaled Salam, ''but Hamas must explain to the
Palestinian public opinion and the authority the details of what
happened.''
Hamas activists, insisting Israel was behind the blast, said they were
not storing explosives in residential areas and a senior guerrilla
leader at the funeral vowed to retaliate against the Jewish state.
''We will take action against the Israeli occupation and we will not
retreat as a result of these killings,'' he said.
Israel denied involvement in the blast.
''They brought their fate upon themselves by their desire to carry out
these murderous terror activities against Israelis,'' Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin told reporters in Jerusalem.
He added that it was likely Hamas would try to stage new attacks to
recover from the setback of the weekend blast.--Reuter/AP.

Washington, Monday
THE baseball strike is off and things are looking up. The season was
due to begin yesterday. At the last moment, on Friday, a judge in New
York summarily ordered the club owners to allow baseball players to work
this year under their old contract.
Players promptly cancelled their strike: this is what they had wanted.
The owners spent the weekend disputing whether to accept the judge's
ruling or lock out the players in a last attempt to resolve the issues.
Perhaps they thought they would be lynched by the fans, perhaps they
balked at the idea of losing another $800m (#533m).
Last night, they announced that the game would resume on April 26,
which gives everyone a good three weeks to get ready.
The players went on strike last August, at the height of the season.
The World Series was cancelled, and baseball fans have been grumbling
ever since.
President Clinton tried his hand at mediation, and failed.
''It's just a couple of hundred people arguing over nearly $2
billion,'' he said. Like everyone else, barring the principles, he could
not see why there was no settlement.
In the past decade or so, the owners have allowed the salaries of top
players to soar into the stratosphere, to well over $2m (#1.3m) a year
each. Now they want to put a brake, called the cap, on further
inflation.
They say this cap is needed to protect the lesser teams. The Yankees
or the Mets or the Cardinals can afford the high salaries: the teams at
the bottom of the leagues cannot.
Players are unimpressed. They insist on their right to collective
bargaining. When the owners unilaterally imposed the cap last year, the
players struck.
Nothing has been resolved by the strike, and it is quite possible that
the players will walk out again, or that the owners will lock them out.
Americans are much more concerned at the prospect than at the fortunes
of the president or Newt Gingrich.
However, at least the season will start. The tens of thousands of
people whose livelihoods depend on the game, but who are not
major-league players earning millions, are delighted.
The only real losers now are the hundreds of replacement players
drafted by the teams to replace the missing stars. Until the end of last
week, the owners said that they would start the season with these
replacement players, even though very few fans would pay to see them.
With the strike off, however, the unfortunate replacements were
summarily sacked on Saturday, and are now heading disconsolately back
into obscurity.

Hamburg, Monday
A MAN convicted of stabbing tennis star Monica Seles remained free
today on a two-year suspended jail sentence after a judge in Hamburg
rejected an appeal by prosecutors and the injured athlete's lawyer to
put him in prison.
District Judge Gertraut Goering upheld the sentence given in October
1993 to unemployed Guenther Parche, who knifed Seles in the back during
a tennis tournament.
Parche later admitted he carried out the attack so that his idol,
German tennis player Steffi Graf, could again top the world rankings.
Seles, 21, has not played professional tennis since then.
She and prosecutors had appealed Parche's conviction on a charge of
serious bodily injury, asking for a conviction of attempted manslaughter
and a prison term instead of a suspended sentence.
It appeared that the judge had accepted testimony by police officers
and psychiatrists who said that, aside from his fixation on Graf and
Seles, Parche was harmless.
Prosecutor Rolf Rosenkranz said that 40-year-old Parche should be
imprisoned because he had carefully planned the attack, carried it out
in public, and had partly based it on political prejudices.
Parche had spoken of his dislike of Serbs. Seles, an ethnic Hungarian,
was born in the Serbian area of the former Yugoslavia and is now an
American citizen.
Seles did not attend the appeal hearing, but her psychiatrist, Jerry
Russel May, testified that she was suffering post-traumatic stress
disorder.
However homicide detective Rolf Bauer, who headed the interrogation of
Parche after the attack, said Parche had given a credible explanation
that he did not want to maim Seles for life, only put her out of action
until Graf could regain the top spot in women's tennis.
''It was obvious to us all that the man belonged with a doctor and not
in jail,'' he added.--AP.

Rome, Monday
ITALY'S doctors, responding to widespread criticism over the use of
artificial insemination, have banned ''granny mums'' and surrogate
motherhood and barred lesbians from undergoing the procedure.
Their national association also voted to deny artificial insemination
to single women and ban the use of frozen sperm of dead donors.
The new rules ban artificial insemination from being practised on
women over 50 and bar doctors from allowing married couples to seek
''designer babies'' by choosing sperm based on a donor's physical
attributes or social status.
They also ban surrogate motherhood, in which a fertilised egg is
implanted in another woman to carry the pregnancy.
The decisions are binding on Italian doctors, who risk suspension or
expulsion from the professional guild. This would effectively bar them
from practising medicine.
Italy has become a paradise for post-menopausal women who want to
become mothers. A spate of high-profile cases led health minister Elio
Guzzanti to decry what he called ''self-service gynaecology''.
Last year, Rosanna Della Corte, 62, became the world's oldest mother
when she gave birth to a boy after a donor's eggs, fertilised with her
husband's sperm, were implanted in her uterus.--Reuter.

Tel Aviv, Monday
AN ISRAELI shop which sells horrors from the Nazi Holocaust has
cancelled plans to auction a bar of soap which its owner said was made
from the bodies of Jews killed in a death camp.
''We removed it from the auction because private individuals and Chief
Rabbi Yisrael Lau protested,'' said shop owner Menashe Meridack.
His Zodiac Stamp shop, which originally dealt in philately, is stocked
with Holocaust memorabilia including yellow Stars of David, which the
Nazis forced Jews to wear, and identity discs issued to slave labourers.
Meridack said he had purchased the bar of soap from the son of a
former inmate of Buchenwald death camp and had planned to auction it on
April 25 at a starting price of #200.
The soap is described in the shop's catalogue as ''a terrible and
tragic item -- soap of victims in an antique box taken from
Buchenwald''.
The seller, Moshe Yahalom, said he had offered the soap along with
horrific photographs from the Nazi era because he had fallen on hard
times.
''Meridack said I would get a lot of money,'' said Yahalom. ''It pains
me that I had to do this -- but I was not going to go out and steal
money instead.''
News of the auction drew an anguished outcry from Israeli legislator
Dov Shilansky, a survivor of the Second World War Holocaust in which six
million Jews died.
''How can he (Yahalom) live with himself -- selling soap made from his
ancestors? His father kept it as a reminder, so he would never forget,''
Shilansky told Israel Radio.
Shilansky said he would raise in Parliament the issue of the sale of
Holocaust memorabilia. He said such soap, labelled ''made from pure
Jewish fat'', was sold by a German firm during the war.
''If the auction goes ahead, we Holocaust survivors will stand outside
the shop . . . in silence, which will be our loudest cry to heaven,''
Shilansky said.--Reuter.

Bucharest, Monday
AIR accident investigators investigating the crash of a Romanian
Airbus which killed 60 people, most of them Belgians, said there could
have been an explosion on board.
Two anonymous claims of responsibility for the crash emerged today but
Romanian intelligence chiefs warned of hoaxes. The Belgian Interior
Ministry reportedly said there was no proof that an in-flight explosion
occurred.
Tarom Romanian airlines was hit by a spate of hoax bomb alerts today.
One forced a Paris-bound Tarom flight to land in the western city of
Timisoara. No device was found.
Thirty-two Belgians were among those killed on Friday when the Tarom
flight to Brussels crashed in driving snow moments after take-off from
Bucharest's Otopeni airport.
The airline has emphatically ruled out pilot error but has given no
other clue to the cause of the crash, allowing open speculation that it
could have been a bomb.
''We have several reasons which suggest that there could have been an
explosion on board the plane before it crashed, but nothing can be said
for the time being,'' said a Romanian member of the investigating
team.--Reuter.

Brussels, Monday
SEVEN hours of talks between the European Union and Canada over their
bitter North Atlantic fisheries dispute broke up tonight with no
statement.
Canadian officials said only that they did not know if another meeting
was planned.
Meanwhile, Spanish trawlers remained in the disputed zone defying
Canadian coast guards.
Both sides had earlier spoken of progress in efforts to reach
agreement to protect stocks of Greenland halibut, or turbot, the last
important commercial species in the region off the Newfoundland coast,
and to re-establish international fishing rules.
Spain was pessimistic about the talks, but Canadian Fisheries Minister
Brian Tobin told Parliament in Ottawa: ''The negotiations have made very
good progress over the weekend. Only a few matters remain to be resolved
in principle.''
Earlier, European Commission Fisheries spokesman Marco Zatterin told
reporters: ''The two are tangoing very well but they are tangoing
carefully because it is quite easy to step on your partner's toes.''
Zatterin said the EU hoped for a diplomatic solution re-establishing a
legal framework for fishing in the region after Canada this month
extended its jurisdiction beyond the 200-mile limit and imposed a 60-day
ban on turbot fishing.
Spain, however, remained critical. Fisheries Minister Luis Atienza
said negotiations were unsatisfactory because they were not clearing up
the question of international law.
''We operate in international waters and there has to be respect of
certain rules of co-existence,'' he said in Madrid.
However Canada's ambassador to the EU, Jacques Roy, said as he entered
the talks that progress was being made on all fronts.
Canadian spokeswoman Jennifer Sloan insisted that broad agreement had
been reached on some very important issues.
The key issue for Canada was conservation and the necessary
enforcement to ensure it, she said.
One of the main sticking points was Ottawa's demand to put Canadian
fisheries inspectors on every EU vessel fishing in the disputed area, a
European official said.
The EU was only prepared to allow its own inspectors, who would be of
a different nationality to the vessel's captain and crew, he added.
He said the EU had become a little more optimistic in the past few
days.
Canadian officials said about 10 Spanish trawlers had returned to the
disputed area of the Grand Banks, off Newfoundland, and were fishing in
a ''provocative'' manner.
However they ruled out any immediate action against them. ''It's not
the moment to send warships because negotiations are proceeding very
rapidly,'' said Roy.
Spanish fishermen say Canada's attempt to stop them fishing in
international waters is illegal. Canadian coastguards have seized one
Spanish trawler and cut the nets of another since the row erupted on
March 9.--Reuter.

Atlanta, Monday
THE lawyer for Nick Ingram, a British-born man sentenced to die in
Georgia's electric chair, asked a federal court today to postpone the
execution on grounds that death by electrocution ranks as cruel and
inhuman punishment.
Hours after Prime Minister John Major said he could not intercede in
the case, US District Judge Horace Ward said he would rule tomorrow on
whether to approve the fourth stay of execution for 31-year-old Ingram
since 1984.
Lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith told Judge Ward that Georgia was one of
the last three US states which have not replaced the electric chair with
lethal injection.
''There is an overwhelming trend against the use of electrocution,''
he told the court, noting that a former US Supreme Court judge called
the punishment a contemporary version of burning at the stake.
Mr Stafford-Smith also claimed that state officials kept Ingram
sedated throughout his 1983 trial and that a second assailant was
involved in the crime.
Earlier, Mr Major told Ingram's family that he understood their
distress, but there was nothing he could do to stop the execution on
Thursday.
He rejected a request for a face-to-face meeting with Ingram's mother
Anne, who flew to Washington to beg the Prime Minister for help.
The Government takes the view that the sentence was passed after a
full and open trial and that Ingram had fair access to the appeals
process.
Mrs Ingram, from Cambridge, wrote to Downing Street last week urging
the Prime Minister to intervene.
Mr Major, on a two-day visit to Washington, said: ''I understand fully
the very deep distress she must feel . . . I don't think there is
anything further we are in a position to do.''
Mr Stafford-Smith commented: ''I think the prime minister is afraid of
the Americans. And I'm ashamed of him, quite honestly.''
Ingram, who holds dual nationality, was sentenced to death after being
convicted of tying a man and his wife to a tree during a burglary of
their house and shooting them. The man died but his wife survived.
Mary Sawyer testified at Ingram's trial in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1983
that Ingram had pistol-whipped her 55-year-old husband, J C Sawyer.
''He told me he liked to torture the men while the women watched,''
she said.--Reuter.

Perth and Kinross Conservative administration fears a backlash in its
poll campaign if the Party's national figures appear on the scene,
writes NIC OUTTERSIDE
STAY out of the local authority elections is the clear message to
Conservative Central Office from the leader of the Tory administration
on Perth and Kinross District Council.
Mr Angus Bailey has warned parliamentary big guns to stay away and let
his candidates fight the elections for the new Perthshire and Kinross
unitary authority on the back of local successes.
''We don't want the razzmatazz of national affairs -- that is alien to
local government elections,'' said Mr Bailey.
''We run the risk of our voters staying at home because they want to
protest against the Government and that could result in us losing -- I'd
rather the parliamentary big guns stayed at home.
''We want to fight these elections on our own success story in the
three years we have held the administration.''
Mr Bailey cites a new #6m public library constructed within budget and
a district council tax pegged at #110 for three years as indicators of
that success.
The Tories won control of Perth and Kinross District Council in 1992
after four years of an SNP-dominated alliance. However, the
adminstration, which has been heralded by former Scottish Conservative
Party president Sir Michael Hirst as a ''flagship'', is preparing for an
electorate backlash.
The Scottish National Party is predicting massive gains and majority
control of the new 32-seat authority, while Labour is aiming to increase
its three-man representation from the district council.
A recent System 3 opinion poll conducted for The Herald for the
forthcoming parliamentary by-election -- the constituency boundaries
almost correlate with those of the new council -- showed a massive swing
away from the Conservatives.
The poll recorded 48% support for the SNP, with Labour claiming 23%,
leaving the Tories third on 20% and the Liberal Democrats trailing with
9%.
This shift of political opinion is supported by the results of last
year's elections for Tayside Regional Council where Conservative
candidates failed to win a single seat in Perthshire.
Mr Bailey predicts that this time his own seat in Aberearn -- where he
faces SNP regional council leader Ewan Dow -- and that of provost Jean
McCormack at Carse of Gowrie will face the sternest test. But overall it
is the urban areas where the party feels it is vulnerable.
''Our strength is in the countryside and rural villages and places
like Blaigowrie and Pitlochry,'' he said.
His tip for a surprise gain is in Crieff East against Independent
councillor Lucy Thomson where he says the Conservative Party ''will win
hands down''.
The SNP is bouyant after the results of the System 3 poll and claims
that its own canvas returns predict it scooping 17 or 18 seats -- enough
to form the next administration.
The Nationalists should hold their two Perth and two Kinross seats and
make gains at Muirward and Invergowrie and in North Tayside.
Labour should maintain its control of the Perth urban area, with the
hugely popular, and hugely framed, Mr Mike O'Malley, certain to hold
North Muirton, and Mr John Flynn likely to do the same on North Letham.
A Labour breakthrough could occur in North Inch, where charity worker,
Mrs Joan McEwen, should fend off the SNP challenge and unseat
Conservative councillor, Mr Jack McNicol.
The Liberal Democrats will hope that councillors Robert Scott and
Willie Wilson will hold Oakbank/Burghmuir and Stanley with Luncarty and
maybe make another couple of gains.
However, the SNP is confident of success to precede its tilt at the
parliamentary by-election.
''The Tory vote is in danger of total collapse,'' says SNP convener
and councillor Bruce Crawford. ''And it's not just Government policy
which is coming under the voters' spotlight.
''On the doorstep we are meeting extreme concern at the stagnation of
the local council and the failure to properly address the funding for
the flood defences in the future.
''The only thing that will stop us is if people decide to vote Liberal
or Labour . . . the Tories are finished.''

THE Scottish Local Government Minister yesterday accused Strathclyde's
Labour leaders of being ''alarmist and irresponsible'' in their recent
claims that Tory policies would mean huge increases in water and
sewerage charges.
Mr George Kynoch, in a sharply worded letter to council chief Robert
Gould, said injecting competition into water and sewerage investment and
increasing the use of private sector finance gave scope for real
efficiencies in the cost of upgrading environmental standards.
He challenged a report by the Chemical Bank commissioned by the
council, saying its tone was ''partisan'' and its value for money
argument ''prejudiced''.
The report concluded that the Build, Own and Operate schemes (BOOs),
the Government's chosen method for bringing more private money into the
running of water and sewerage services, failed ''any responsible value
for money test''. It said their use by the three new public water
authorities compared to the more traditional financing methods used by
councils would impose ''excessive and unnecessary burdens'' on council
tax payers.
Mr Kynoch, however, said the report's value for money argument was
prejudiced by the assumption that the private sector would not achieve
efficiency gains in capital costs.
''The potential for efficiency gains comes from the investor being
able to make investment decisions knowing his capital is at stake and
knowing he will have to come up with low cost solutions to win a
contract,'' he explained in his letter.
It demanded the genuine passing of responsibility for investment
decisions to the private sector using financial structures capable of
bearing risks without disproportionate cost.
The use of more private investment would inject the rigours of
competition into the provision of water and sewerage services and
promised the potential for real efficiencies, the Minister insisted.
Mr Kynoch went on: ''It is alarmist and irresponsible for the council
to translate some simple and flawed projections into talk of higher
costs for customers. The Chemical Bank report merely demonstrates that
poorly conceived schemes will not be acceptable.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde said Councillor Gould had not yet seen the
Minister's letter.
However, Mr Gould was understood to be angry about the ''flippant''
way in which Mr Kynoch had dismissed the Chemical Bank's report.

Labour administration at this week's local elections.
Campaigning in the Stockbridge area he said that under Labour 300
extra teachers had been employed, 200 more police officers were on the

A SCATHING attack on the Government's ''indifference'' to the world TB
pandemic was delivered last night by the man who devised the cure for
the disease in Scotland 40 years ago.
Sir John Crofton, for decades the World Health Organisation's leading
authority on tuberculosis, said failure of support by the West might now
lay it open to a resurgence of untreatable, drug resistant TB from the
Third World.
He said the WHO had launched a #15m emergency programme, but despite
generous support from France, Germany, and Scandinavia, Britain had
given nothing.
''Frankly speaking, parts of Africa are giving far more help than we
are,'' Sir John, 83, said. ''The present Government has cut its overseas
aid very extensively but although we have some good officials, they have
little funds.''
He was speaking at the presentation of the Edinburgh Medal awarded for
the work of his team in developing combination chemotherapy, the first
100% cure and still the the world's standard treatment for tuberculosis.
Its application had seen the virtual eradication of TB in developed
countries. However, lack of resources and poor treatment by ignorant and
greedy doctors using drugs individually which bred resistant strains,
had seen epidemics across Africa and in Asia, often associated with
Aids.
Despite the availability of the cheap cure developed in Edinburgh, the
WHO estimates TB will kill at least 30 million people over the next
decade by which time it could infect one third of the world's
population. New York has experienced an epidemic, controlled only after
the Edinburgh system had been re-applied, and TB was also rising rapidly
in the former Soviet Union.
Sir John said the WHO TB budget was one tenth of that for Aids and
quite inadequate. No new drugs had been developed for treating
tuberculosis since the 1960s.
He contrasted current British indifference with earlier valuable work
by the Medical Research Council and others in organising programmes to
combat the disease in some countries.
''If the remaining countries do not act quickly, with international
help, they face a future with an uncontrollable epidemic of TB,'' he
said. ''Untreatable drug-resistant TB might well then spread to the
industrial world. It is very much in our interest that the pandemic in
Asia is coped with.''
Sir John also spoke of the wider pro-active role medicine and science
should take in improving society.
He said Scotland's poor health record was strongly associated with
poverty and inequality. Much greater support was needed for self-help
and community groups to tackle the vicious circle of deprivation and
ill-health.
Sir John urged the adoption of rational, scientific methods used to
combat tuberculosis and smoking-related diseases, to be applied to
crime.
He said politicians and the media often adopted a simplistic approach,
furthering their own ends, to what was a far more complex subject.

AN ambitious project to turn a golf club on the outskirts of Aberdeen
into a major tourist attraction is being backed by Grampian Enterprise.
Newmachar Golf Club only opened five years ago and now work is
underway to complete a second course, and on Saturday one of the longest
driving ranges in the country will be opened on the site.
The first course, Hawskhill, was designed by former Ryder Cup player
David Thomas and has established a reputation as one of the most
challenging in the country, with a standard scratch rating of 74.
Swailend, also designed by David Thomas, will run to 6300 yards with a
par of 72 when it opens in the summer of 1996.
The new #470,000 course has been backed by Grampian Enterprise, and
the head of tourism, Mr David Swarbrick, believes the development of a
multi-use centre such as Newmachar will be a major factor in attracting
visitors.
He said: ''This is more than just another golf course. It is part of a
new generation of golf complexes which encompasses playing, teaching, a
driving range, major tournaments, golf schools and clinics.''
Club captain John McIntosh said: ''Last year we attracted 5500
visitors from throughout Britain and Europe. It became clear that, if we
wanted to build on our international reputation, yet still provide high
quality golf and available tee-times, the club needed to expand.''

THE fine traditions of Glasgow School of Art could soon be gracing the
doormats of homes and offices throughout the world following the issue
today by the Post Office of an aerogramme to mark the school's 150th
anniversary.
One hundred thousand aerogrammes outlining the school's education and
encouragement of inventive and creative artists, designers, and
architects will be available for 45p at Scottish post offices.
The Post Office has issued two aerogrammes annually for more than 20
years to mark important historic events or anniversaries north of the
Border.
Normally, they are designed by in-house philatelic experts in London.
However, one of this year's issues was designed by Mr Mike Healey, head
of design at Glasgow School of Art, and features nine works by students
at the school which was founded in 1845 as a Government school of
design.
Mr Healey revealed that Post Office officials had been keen to base
the aerogramme on Charles Rennie Mackintosh's works, or paintings by
some of the school's former students, including artists Stephen Conroy
and Peter Howson.
However, Mr Healey said: ''After much deliberation the PO very bravely
agreed to celebrate the school's links with industry, which is what a
lot of our work is about.''
The aerogramme, in the event, includes illustrations of a design for a
chocolate making machine, an embroidered fashion hat, and printed
textiles.
Mr Kenneth Graham, chairman of the Scottish Post Office board, said:
''The aerogramme gives a colourful snapshot of the exciting world of the
Glasgow School of Art.
''It builds on a relationship which saw the school feature on a
postage stamp in 1990 and is our tribute to a very special record of
contributing to visual education in Scotland.''
Professor Dugald Cameron, director of the school, said: ''This is a
great honour for the school. We have a great affection for the Post
Office, born of our mutual interests in the arts of communication.''

NINETY jobs have been created with the opening yesterday of the House
of Bruar, a multi-million pound retail development at the Falls of Bruar
in Perthshire.
Designed in the style of a Victorian shooting lodge, it is intended to
be a showcase for the best of Scottish produce and textiles.
The development includes a garden centre, gift shop, restaurant, food
hall, countrywear hall, and cloth and cashmere rooms.
It is believed that the House of Bruar, built on the site of the
former Falls of Bruar Hotel, constitutes the largest private investment
in Scotland's tourism industry for many years.
It is the brainchild of Mark and Linda Birkbeck who have invested
''several millions'' of their own fortune into the scheme.
Mr Birkbeck, who founded the Jumpers knitwear chain, said: ''Scottish
produce from fabrics to foodstuffs, from whisky to woollens, is rightly
famed all over the world.
''We have aimed to concentrate the best Scotland has to offer under
one roof.''

GRAMPIAN'S chief constable attacked the English football authorities
yesterday for sending out a confusing message to youngsters about the
use of drugs.
Dr Ian Oliver said sportsmen in Grampian were used as role models in
the fight against drug abuse, but the football authorities in England
were being seen to give only ''a slap on the wrist'' to players caught
using ''social'' drugs.
Last night, however, the English FA stressed its was fiercely opposed
to players using recreational drugs and would launch a campaign today
called Fit For Football in which disgraced Arsenal player Paul Merson
will warn against taking drugs.
Dr Oliver made his comments while presenting his annual report which
shows that seizures of cannabis in Grampian rose more than four fold in
1994, cocaine by five fold, and 15 times as many ecstasy tablets were
seized.
In every major drugs seizure firearms were usually to be found, but Dr
Oliver believed this was because the dealers wanted to create a macho
image rather than actually use the weapons.
He commented: ''We have established quite clearly that we have moved
on from ecstasy to large amounts of cocaine and heroin being freely
available in the North-east with direct channels of communication
between the North-west of England, Liverpool in particular, and dealers
here.
''The Liverpool dealers are manifesting so much confidence in the
market here they are actually prepared to come up and deal themselves.
''We have had some spectacular successes and locked up some people who
are going to be spending quite a long time behind bars, but that isn't
any great cause for rejoicing because the rewards are so great now that
interdiction and enforcement never have been enough.
''It is a sad fact of life that the rewards for dealers are so great
that there are many willing to step into the shoes of those who are
jailed.''
''It is foolish to pretend it isn't everywhere you look.
''What is appalling is that it is the norm now for footballers to be
picked up as having had a test proving they have used cocaine, heroin,
cannabis and the attitude of the supervising body seems to be 'Yes, it's
a bit naughty but . . .', and we really ought not to tolerate that kind
of thing. These people set examples.''
He said this was giving the message that in some way it was actually
all right to take social drugs.
He stressed this was not the case in Grampian where they had the
support of Aberdeen Football Club.
''We are trying to create role models from sportsmen, but if our local
team is saying don't take drugs and yet a national football executive
says 'Well it's only a social drug and if he does it again we might slap
his wrist', that is not doing very much to our role model promotion.
''We are getting ambivalent messages coming out.''
He said when national sportsmen came into focus in these circumstances
the governing bodies had to make it clear this would not be tolerated.
Dr Oliver added that a co-ordinated national policy was required to
address the problem in school, the workplace, and the home.
''For far too long now people have been rubbing their hands and saying
'Isn't it terrible; something must be done'.
''We are now going to be saying what we think should be done and
investing time and effort into ensuring demand reduction by education is
a substantial part of the education process.''
Grampian Police have spent two years developing ''Police Box'' which
is an education liaison project currently being tested.
It involves an all-purpose ''skills for living package'', part of
which deals with problems of substance abuse.
Dr Oliver said businesses had to establish a policy under which it was
not seen as an infringement of civil liberties for staff to be drug
tested but a normal part of their contract.
However, if people were found to have a problem, sacking should not be
the automatic reaction.
''If it is identified that someone has a problem, an alternative
pattern of advice and guidance should be available and, if required,
treatment should be offered before first rushing to dismiss people,'' he
said.
He stressed it was important to educate parents and teachers about the
dangers of drugs.

A GLASGOW couple who challenged the adoption of their son have forced
a change in the rules covering children's hearings.
Mr Anthony McMichael, 58, and his wife Margaret, 40, of Knightswood,
said they had not received a fair hearing when their son was taken into
care seven years ago shortly after birth.
Their complaint was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights which
awarded a joint compensation payment of #8000.
The court found they were unfairly denied documents relevant to their
case. As a result of their legal challenge the Scottish Office has
agreed to alter the rules over access to documents.
A letter from the social work services group has been passed to The
Herald. It remarks that a new Children (Scotland) Bill has already been
prepared and introduced into Parliament.
It adds: ''In addition, preparations are in hand to consult interested
organisations on amendments to the hearing's rules following the
European Court's decision on the McMichael case. After consultation,
Ministers will decide on the amended rules which should be presented to
Parliament.
''The European Court's judgment has implications for certain
procedures in the children's hearings system, which is unique to
Scotland.''
Mr and Mrs McMichael said the promise to change the rules was a
partial victory which may help other parents in the future. But they
promised to continue the fight to win custody of their son.
Mr McMichael said the boy was taken into care after Mrs McMichael
began to suffer mental illness. He added: ''There was no evidence of
neglect or abuse yet our boy was adopted.''
Glasgow lawyer Peter McCann represented the couple at the European
Court. He said the rules at the centre of the dispute had denied Mr and
Mrs McMichael full access to officially-held information on their case,
hindering the investigation.
He criticised the Scottish Office for taking two years since the
couple first received the backing of the European authorities to agree
to a rule change.
''The Scottish Office have certainly taken their time to change the
law -- it could have been changed easily and it's disgraceful that it
wasn't. I had to write to both the Secretary of State for Scotland and
the Prime Minister to try and get something done.''

A WOMAN has been found dead by the grave of her recently stillborn
baby.
Mrs Cheryl Brown, 27, was found lying face-down at the graveside in
Heworth Cemetery at Felling, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, early last
Friday.
A post mortem examination carried out at Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth
Hospital yesterday failed to establish a cause of death. Samples would
be sent for toxicology testing, the coroner's officer said.
A police spokesman said there were no suspicious circumstances.
Mrs Brown's baby girl was born dead at full-term nine weeks ago.
It is understood notes to Mrs Brown's family were found with her body,
which may have lain in the cemetery overnight.
Mrs Brown and her husband, John, who have a nine-year-old daughter,
recently moved to a flat at Burnbank, Leam Lane Estate, Felling.
After bad weather put her off her original plan to lay flowers on the
grave on Sunday, March 26, Mrs Brown left home with the same aim last
Thursday and was not seen alive again.
Her body was found by a workman arriving at the cemetery.

<HEADLINE>Research supports 'cure' for morning sickness</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979058918</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DRUG-FREE cure for morning sickness is being denied pregnant women
despite being supported by clinical trials, it was claimed today.
A new report says there is evidence that acupressure -- a technique
which works through the application of pressure to specific points on
the body -- can relieve nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.
The ''acupoints'' are close to the skin and are numbered and named.
Most occur in small depressions or hollows between bones, muscles or
tendons.
The authors of The Power of Pressure report suggest that nausea due to
general anaesthetics, chemotherapy and motion sickness could also be
treated through acupressure, which is being studied as a possible
therapy for insomnia, and migraine.
More than half a million pregnant women in Britain this year will
struggle through morning sickness which, the report says, could be
prevented by acupressure to their wrists, applied using sweatbands
containing tiny rubber cones.
A trial at Queen's University, Belfast, involving 350 women with
morning sickness showed those using acupressure to their wrists suffered
significantly less nausea and vomiting than those who did not undergo
the treatment.
It is believed that the technique stimulates the release of endorphins
which help relieve pain -- similar to the supposed effect of acupuncture
in Chinese medicine.
Dr George Lewith, who heads the Centre for the Study of Complementary
Medicine in Southampton, has carried out several studies on the
technique.
''Theoretically and practically, implementing acupressure in many NHS
hospitals would be very simple and would save the country a great deal
of money,'' he said.
Dr George Ghaly, consultant anaesthetist at Wigan Infirmary, who
offers acupressure to relieve post-operative nausea, said: ''It's a
great shame that so few doctors are aware of the benefits of
acupressure.
''If you went into an ante-natal clinic and said 'I can show you a
simple technique to prevent you being sick', nine out of 10 women
suffering with morning sickness would try it.''
In a recent British survey, three quarters of those asked said they
would like to see complementary therapies, such as acupuncture,
available on the NHS, but these are rarely offered, the report claims.

BRITISH Telecom has rediscovered the alphabet. It is to bring back
phones with letters, as well as numbers, on dials.
BT hopes that firms will see the marketing possiblities of registering
a number that also spells, for example, P-I-Z-Z-A, D-R-A-I-N-S or
T-A-X-I. However, it says it is unlikely letter dialling will become
commonplace until the next century.
Letters used to be standard on British phones, because exchanges were
identified with letters instead of numbers. However, such phones began
to go out of existence when all-number dialling was introduced in the
1960s.
Letter-cum-number dials are common in America -- one florist can be
reached by dialling 1-800-FLOWER -- and many British companies are also
said to be keen on the idea, with some believed to be reserving letters
already.

THE chairman and deputy chairman of collapsed merchant bank Barings
resigned yesterday, as a matter of ''honour and principle''.
Mr Peter Baring and Mr Andrew Tuckey are the first boardroom
departures since the merchant bank, Britain's oldest, collapsed facing
huge debts from trading in the Far East.
The two men have also quit as members of the committees currently
conducting the management of Barings.
Mr Tuckey has agreed to remain as a senior adviser to Barings'
corporate finance business, with which he has been associated over many
years.
Resignations have been expected at Barings following former dealer
Nick Leeson's disastrous trading in the derivatives futures market in
Singapore, which brought about the collapse of the bank with losses
estimated at one time at #860m. He is currently fighting extradition to
Singapore from a Frankfurt prison cell.
More senior executives are expected to go after the Bank of England
inquiry into the affair is published.
Both Mr Baring, whose departure will leave just three members of the
family still at the company at different levels, and Mr Tuckey had
offered their resignations at the time of ING's rescue and takeover of
Barings on March 5, but had been persuaded to stay on and help with the
transition.
Neither they nor the rest of the board had taken bonuses, although
ING's rescue package had provided for bonuses for the rest of the staff.
In a statement, ING's Hessel Lindenbergh said: ''We have accepted the
resignations of Peter Baring and Andrew Tuckey with regret. We accept
fully that they have made their decision on the basis of honour and
principle.
''Both Peter Baring and Andrew Tuckey have made a massive commitment
over the past few weeks to ensure that Barings was able to re-establish
its business and operational base successfully.''
For their part, Mr Baring and Mr Tuckey said: ''Although our
resignations have been available to ING as a matter of principle for
some time, nonetheless, it has been right for us, thus far, to share in
the task of restoring the stability of the Barings Group.
''With ING now established as the new owners of Barings, and with the
individual businesses in the group returning to normal, ING and we have
agreed that the time has come for us to resign.''
It is understood that there is no question of any sort of pay-off for
either of them.
Both men had originally agreed to stay on until the official report on
the Barings collapse is made available from the Board of Banking
Supervision, but this could be several months away.
The Governor of the Bank of England and board member, Mr Eddie George,
said recently that it would not finish investigating the Barings affair
for two months. The report on the lessons to be learnt from the
investigation could take a further three months to compile.

THE Princess of Wales, home from a frosty skiing holiday, was warm and
welcoming yesterday during an official engagement with Prince Harry at
Kensington Palace.
Amid speculation that she returned from the sometimes camera-shy
Austrian trip to comfort her sick sister-in-law, Countess Spencer, the
princess was all smiles when she met children from London's Great Ormond
Street Hospital and soldiers of the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment,
who are taking part in the 1995 London to Mexico rally to raise money
for the hospital.
Buckingham Palace said that whether the princess visits her brother
Charles's wife Victoria, reportedly having treatment for the slimmers'
disease anorexia nervosa, was a ''private'' matter.
The countess, 29, a former model, is also said to be receiving
treatment for drink-related problems at the #1300-a-week Farm Place
Clinic, Surrey.
Diana herself suffered from the eating disorder, bulimia.
Earl Spencer yesterday formally complained to the Press Complaints
Commission about alleged media harassment of his wife at the clinic and
''invasion of privacy and breach of the newspaper industry's code of
conduct''.
A statement from PCC chairman Lord Wakeham said the allegations were
against the News of the World, the People and the Daily Mirror.
Lord Wakeham refused to comment until he had heard the views of all
concerned.
The complaint would be investigated by PCC privacy commissioner,
Professor Robert Pinker, and adjudicated upon by the full commission
''as swiftly as possible''.

THE MATRON of a home for severely handicapped children thought she was
going to be offered the post of general manager minutes before she was
dismissed for no apparent reason, it emerged yesterday.
The dismissal of Mrs Eleanor ''Lynn'' McCreadie, 55, who served for
eight years as matron of the charity-run East Park Home in Maryhill,
Glasgow, has angered politicians, doctors, and unions.
The home has declined to go into detail about the reasons for Mrs
McCreadie's dismissal, although it concedes professional misconduct was
not involved.
Many of the home's 46 children, aged from two to 19, require
round-the-clock nursing care. Fears have been expressed by parents that
East Park may face a change of direction and become a residential
school.
The home has faced problems in raising the #2.5m a year it costs to
run it each year, despite receiving about 60% of its funding from the
Scottish Education Department. It has depended to some extent on
financial backing from Scottish entertainers, including Billy Connolly
and Elaine C Smith, and businessmen such as Mr Ralph Halley.
Concern has been expressed in medical circles that the home is now
under the control of Mrs May Henderson, an administrator and former
wages clerk, who has no formal medical qualifications. She was not
available for comment yesterday. A nursing sister, Miss Stewart, has
been placed in charge of nursing duties.
The Herald has learned that two weeks ago Mrs McCreadie was summoned
unexpectedly to a meeting with senior members of its board of directors.
It took place in the Buchanan Street office of board director Sir
Matthew Goodwin, chairman of Hewden Stuart, in the company of board
chairman Mrs Paddy Burnett.
A source said yesterday: ''Mrs McCreadie was told the board was
appointing a general manager and initially thought she was going to be
offered the job. However, she was then informed that 'due to a
reorganisation' she was being dismissed with immediate effect.''
The source said the board members ordered the matron not to return to
the home.
An internal review of the home's future, which is thought to have
looked at moves towards care in the community, is understood to have
been led over the past 12 months by Dr Kenneth McAlpine, a consultant
physician specialising in geriatric medicine at Paisley's Royal
Alexandra Hospital. He declined to comment yesterday.
Sir Matthew Goodwin refused to comment on Mrs McCreadie's dismissal,
saying it was ''an entirely private matter'' for the board. Sir Matthew
also dismissed suggestions that the home was in financial trouble or
that it was changing its function from providing a round-the-clock
service to a daytime-only facility with more care in the community.
Dr Matthew Dunnigan, a visiting consultant at East Park who
specialises in nutritional problems, described Mrs McCreadie's dismissal
as ''quite disgraceful''. He warned that it could have enormous
implications for the children.
Mrs McCreadie, at her home in Milngavie, would say only: ''I can
confirm that my employment has been terminated and I am seeking legal
advice.''
The Royal College of Nursing said the matron would be represented by
the union's solicitors.
Labour's Scottish Health spokesman, Mr John McCallion, said he would
demand an explanation for the dismissal from the board's directors.
Nursing sources said there was concern among staff over suggestions
that the needs of some of the profoundly-handicapped youngsters were so
basic that skilled nurses were not necessary to provide that level of
care.
The home is registered as a nursing home, and as such comes under the
jursidiction of Greater Glasgow Health Board, whose officers are
responsible for inspecting it.
Mr Tim Huntingford, assistant director of childcare with Strathclyde
region, said: ''We were in discussions with East Park along with many
other places about the way the services might evolve and develop in the
coming years as part of the Care in the Community policies.''

THE police chief in charge of the inquiry into the death of prominent
Scottish Nationalist Willie McRae 10 years ago spoke out publicly for
the first time yesterday.
Former Detective Superintendent Andrew Lister defended the Northern
Constabulary investigation into the death of the Glasgow lawyer and
former SNP vice-chairman and denied there had been anything sinister
about the circumstances of his death.
His comments are bound to fuel the renewed debate over the
circumstances of Mr McRae's death, which last week led to more than 15
MPs calling for a public inquiry.
Mr McRae's maroon Volvo car was found 29 yards off the bleak A87 by
Loch Loyne in Inverness-shire by an Australian tourist at 10am on
Saturday April 6, 1985.
Mr McRae's body was discovered in the driving seat of the car, an
apparent victim of a road crash, but some hours later at Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary a nurse discovered a single gunshot wound to his right temple.
There has been particular concern over a number of aspects of the
police handling of the incident, including the fact that pieces of
evidence had been removed from the scene before the police inquiry
began.
The next day a .22 Smith and Wesson pistol was discovered by young
police officer Kenny Crawford some yards from where the car had been
found.
Following a 48-hour police inquiry the procurator-fiscal at Inverness
stated that there were no suspicious circumstances and the
Solicitor-General at the time, Mr Peter Fraser, refused to hold an
inquiry.
Many friends say that Mr McRae, 61, was under surveillance by Special
Branch officers and some claim he was murdered by the British Secret
Service.
Speaking from his retirement cottage outside Inverness yesterday Mr
Lister denied that there had been anything sinister about the SNP
activist's death.
He said the renewed call for a public inquiry would be a waste of
public money.
Mr Lister added: ''More harm is being done to Willie McRae's memory by
these supposed friends of his who are calling for an inquiry.
''His relatives were asked by the Lord Advocate if they wanted a fatal
accident inquiry and they declined.
''However, any inquiry would not show anything sinister. Willie McRae
took his own life.''
Mr McRae's partner for 22 years in his Glasgow legal practice, Mr Len
Murray, has also said he believed Mr McRae had killed himself.

Industrial peacemakers Acas dealt with a growing number of pay
disputes as demand for its services reached record levels last year,
writes ROY ROGERS, Industrial Correspondent.
This was despite the fact that strikes remain at an historically low
level.
More than half the 1300 disputes which Acas helped to settle were
related to pay or terms and conditions of employment, including the
long-running signal workers' strike.
Acas said in its annual report that the economic recovery had
generated higher expectations of pay rises which managements had
resisted, but that very large pay increases awarded to some senior
managers, particularly on newly privatised organisations, might have
provoked ''greater pushfullness'' from trade union negotiators.
Acas chairman John Hougham said the increase in pay disputes was not
surprising because wage bargaining had taken a ''back seat'' during the
recession, with companies imposing wage freezes on some workers.

<TEXT>
IT will be business as usual for thousands of workers on May 8 as few
private sector employers have followed the Government's recommendation
that the 50th anniversary of VE (Victory in Europe) Day be marked with a
holiday.
Mr Jim Moohan, regional industrial officer of the GMB union, said
there was widespread disappointment among workers that employers had
refused to recognise the significance of the anniversary of the end of
the Second World War.
He said: ''It's very sad that employers are not recognising what VE
Day meant to the UK and the world. If we are going to pay our respects,
employers should recognise this day as a public holiday. Many of our
members believed VE Day was a statutory day off.''
Mr Bill Scott, divisional organiser of the Amalgamated Engineering,
Electrical Union, said the extra bank holiday had caused great confusion
and disappointment.
''Many employees assumed they were getting both the 1st and 8th off.
But, with the exception of local authorities and a few other
organisations, companies have announced staff will not get the 8th off,
unless they want to swap it for the 1st,'' he said.
Mr Pat McCormick, divisional organiser of the Union of Shop,
Distributive and Allied Workers, said the indications were that most
companies would treat May 1, and not May 8, as a holiday.
''We would like to see companies give employees both holidays but it
appears it will be one or the other,'' he said.
A CBI spokesman said in the absence of any legal requirement to make
VE Day a holiday most companies were opting for only one of the dates.
Around 13,000 Scottish Office and Prison Service staff are angry that
they are losing their May Day 'Labour Day' holiday for the VE Day
holiday.
Scottish Office trade union vice chairman John Moffat attacked the
Secretary of State for encouraging employers to recognise VE Day as an
extra bank holiday while denying some civil servants the May Day bank
holiday.
Meanwhile, British Rail is offering rail tickets at half price to
senior citizens so that war veterans can attend celebrations during the
first two weeks of May.
Over 750,000 over-60s who have Senior Railcard or Senior Network Cards
can obtain half price tickets instead of the normal 34% reduction.
* More than a quarter of British workers believe their jobs are less
secure and 90% believe they are no more secure than three months ago,
according to a survey published yesterday by the white-collar union MSF,
writes IAN BRUCE.
The quarterly survey reveals that a ''feel-bad factor'' based on
continuing redundancies and closures is the top concern throughout
British industry, despite Government claims that unemployment is
falling.
The poll was conducted in 412 private and public sector firms and
involved about 140,000 workers from manufacturing, construction,
insurance, health, education and voluntary organisations.
The financial services sector shows the highest level of insecurity
about jobs. Almost 75% of sales staff, 38% of clerical and
administrative staff, and 31% of supervisory grades said they felt less
confident about continuing job prospects.
A total of 15% reported that employers' treatment of workers had
worsened over the last quarter, and 44% claimed that general treatment
of staff was poor or very poor.
Apart from job security, pay continued to be the main issue in the
workplace. Stress shows a rise for the second successive quarter and is
highest in financial services, the voluntary sector, health, and
electronics.

A HOMOSEXUAL beggar who battered his down-and-out lover to death
during a drunken row, was jailed for eight years at the High Court in
Edinburgh yesterday.
Stewart Gordon, 46, punched, kicked, and stamped on Mr Thomas Walker
leaving his shoeprint on his victim's head.
The pair had rowed after Mr Walker, 52, emerged from a drunken sleep
and questioned Gordon's faithfulness to him.
After beating his partner to death, Gordon went to sleep in the same
flat before going out the following morning to buy more drink, a radio
and long-life batteries, because he knew he was going to prison.
Gordon, unemployed and of no fixed abode, admitted killing Mr Walker.
He was originally charged with murder, but the Crown accepted his plea
to the reduced charge of culpable homicide.
He attacked his victim on December 8, in a flat at Little France
House, Craigour Place, Edinburgh, by punching and kicking him repeatedly
on the head and body, compressing his throat, and stamping on him.
Jailing Gordon, Lord Mayfield said: ''You took a man's life when you
were out of control. This was a brutal assault carried out with
persistence.''
Advocate depute Iain Bonomy, QC, said both men were homosexuals and
had ''an ongoing physical relationship''.
Both men had previously been married, but in recent years had been
drinking more and more, and came to regard themselves as a couple.
Gordon received invalidity benefit and thetwo men, who were sleeping
rough in doorways and derelict buildings, supplemented their income by
begging. The vast majority of their money went on drink.
The pair were at their regular begging stance outside Edinburgh's St
James Centre, when a teenage girl they knew took pity on them and
offered to let them stay at her flat.
Gordon, Walker, and two other men went back to the flat for a drinking
session, but the other two eventually left.
Walker had fallen asleep, but came around and got into an argument
with Gordon, who lost control and started attacking him.
He later told police: ''He started hitting me, so I just belted him
back . . . I started kicking him and kicked him and kicked him.''
Tests on Walker, a former butcher, later revealed that he had a blood
alcohol level five times the drink-driving limit.

THE new #200m cruise liner Oriana, built in Germany, arrived at her
home port of Southampton yesterday as a band played on the quayside and
fire tenders sent plumes of water into the air.
The 69,000-tonne P&amp;O flagship will be officially named by the Queen on
Thursday before leaving on her maiden voyage on Sunday to the Atlantic
islands.
Thousands lined the shore yesterday as she sailed up the Solent and
Southampton Water. Tugs nudged her into her berth at the Mayflower
terminal.
The ship, which can carry nearly 2000 passengers and is 853ft long,
was ''superb'' said her captain, Commodore Ian Gibb.
P&amp;O dismissed reports that continuing problems with the propellers,
which had delayed her departure from the shipyard at Papenburg, were
causing excessive vibration.
The company's chairman, Lord Sterling, said that it was believed
further modification to the propellers could reduce the vibration at
high speed in heavy seas. However, he said passengers would not notice
anything, as she would not be moving at those speeds.
The Oriana will operate 17 European and Caribbean cruises this year.
She has ten passenger decks, 914 cabins, and features the largest
swimming pool of any ship.
Her art collection of nearly 3000 works by British artists is more
than are hung in the National Gallery.
Mr Davey Hall, Tyneside district secretary of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, said it was a ''scandal'' that she was
not built in Britain, where thousands of shipbuilding jobs have been
lost over the past few years.
''That this important vessel could not be built in Britain is a
testament of how this vital industry has been allowed to decay by this
Government,'' he said.
''It is a scandal when you think of the jobs that such an order would
have generated.''
No British company tendered for the liner.
* Oriana 1995 is the fastest liner built for 25 years, with a cruising
speed of 24 knots.
* Her hull is protected by an electronic forcefield to prevent
corrosion.
* A total of 2.5 acres of outdoor deck area make it the most spacious
of any cruise ship afloat.
* The two stabilisers each weigh 93 tonnes -- the largest of their
kind ever fitted to a cruise ship.
* Most expensive cruise: #35,280 round-the-world. Cheapest: #540 for
12 nights in August.
* Oriana was the title chosen by sixteenth century courtiers to honour
Queen Elizabeth I.

THEY do things differently in the House of Lords. ''I find that answer
slightly unsatisfactory,'' Lord Bruce of Donington (Lab.) yesterday told
Lady Chalker, a Foreign Office Minister.
''Slightly unsatisfactory'' hardly would be recognised as critical in
a House of Commons increasingly devoted to going over the top on a wide
front of grievances.
Lord Bruce is 82 and was in the Commons from 1945 to 1950 as a
backbench supporter of the Attlee Government. That great man was no
admirer of hyperbole, nor indeed of long sentences and, though he
surprised, and in some cases, annoyed his former followers by accepting
an earldom, he probably found the Lords style congenial.
For, although they have better manners than the Commons, one should
not be misled by this and the venerable aspect of many of the members --
''the strongest proof of life after death'' Jeremy Thorpe once called
their Chamber -- into thinking that the political arts are not practised
here.
Lord Bruce earlier had remarked that he understood the Spanish
Government's fisheries inspectors were based in Madrid in the middle of
the Iberian peninsula, which seemed, he added with nice irony, somewhat
''remote'' from Spain's fishing ports.
Earl Howe, a junior Agriculture Minister, said the autonomous regions
had their own inspectors and there also were the Spanish Maritime Police
Unit and the Spanish Civil Guard Naval Unit, all intent -- although Lord
Howe did not say this, on turning a (if they will forgive the
expression) Nelson Eye on the activities of the industrious Spanish
fishing fleet.
Lord Tebbit then asked how much independence of action the UK had in
framing its policies for the troubled fishing areas of the world. This
fulfilled the rule of interrogation in law and politics that the best
questions are those to which you already know the answers.
In many of these areas, Lord Howe was obliged to reply,''we are
represented by the European Union which signs the agreement on our
behalf.'' Lord Tebbit smiled grimly.
Were we prepared for a confrontation when the tuna fishing season
opened, barked Lord Campbell of Croy (Con). Lord Howe gasped that the
Government certainly hoped there would be no confrontation. ''Everything
will be done to ensure provocative actions are avoided.'' One doubted if
the Cortes was hearing the same sort of thing from their Fisheries
Minister.
Lady Chalker, not a Euro-sceptical Minister, said things were
beginning to go Britain's way in the European Union, an assertion often
made by Foreign Office Ministers.
Time did not permit her to give many examples, but she incautiously
remarked that the European Court of Justice recently had ruled in a
number of cases in ways which the court was ''more sensitive to member
states' concerns.
However, surely, said Lord Tebbit, uncoiling himself again from his
seat behind the bishops, a court of law should be concerned solely with
upholding the law and not fluctating in its judgments to one side or the
other according to whose interests it was currently sensitive.
Baroness Chalker is a doughty lady but, although she said she did not
mean to imply that, her unhappy response that she only meant the court
''seems to be taking the member states' interests into account'' did not
seem to rebut Lord Tebbit's charge that the court is a somewhat
political animal which seems to have hopes of being for Europe what the
Supreme Court is for the United States, an interpreter of the
constitution according to the politically correct mores at the time.
Lady Chalker did, however, have a small triumph. An agitated Lord
Wyatt of Weeford (Crossbencher) inquired if the Government could prevent
the EU scrapping the 700-year-old British practice of hallmarking gold
and silver items. She told him the Council of Ministers had decided not
to go ahead with it. One small step for subsidiarity, perhaps.
The Lords were back at being discreet when Lord Wigoder (Lib Dem)
asked about tip-offs to the press that arrests were about to be made in
cases like that of ''a well- known footballer,'' perhaps desiring that
no more publicity be given to kung fu expert Eric Cantona. This delicacy
was prolonged by Lord Williams of Mostyn, (Lab), not a man to call a
bribe a bribe, who sought reassurance that for a copper ''to accept a
gratuity'' to provide such information was an offence.
Lady Blatch, for the Home Office, said these things were difficult to
prove, at which the saturnine Lord Campbell of Alloway (Con.) said
sternly that that was the same reply she had given him on an earlier
occasion and was it not time the Hime Office got weaving.
The Minister hardly countered this riposte, observing weakly that, of
course, the information might simply come to journalists ''who are on
the look-out.''
Lord Avebury (Lib. Dem.) suggested that, as Mr Cantona was so
well-known that he was unlikely to skip the country, ''Why not ring him
up and ask him to report to the police station.'' This appeared too
simple for the Home Office or, perhaps, nobody had thought of it.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson has demanded an apology
from Tory MP Raymond Robertson for suggesting that Labour did not want
the Scottish Grand Committee to sit in Aberdeen.
Mr Robertson denied objecting to the choice of Aberdeen as a venue for
one of the committee's regular sittings outside Westminster. He had only
opposed the ''arrogant way'' in which the Government had tried to force
a sudden decision on MPs.
In a letter to the Aberdeen South MP, Mr Robertson said: ''I have all
along said that a visit to Aberdeen was important for the Grand
Committee even if it were only to show the people of the North-east of
Scotland the isolation the Scottish Tory MPs now represent in
Parliament.''
However, he added: ''I did of course object to the typically arrogant
way in which the Government failed to consult on the timing of the
meeting in Aberdeen''. The Government had given MPs 24 hours to decide
whether or not to go, without taking into account difficulties in making
travel plans.
''To suggest that this logistic discussion was an objection to
Aberdeen as a venue is to twist the facts in a manner unworthy of a Tory
party vice-chairman,'' he said.
In reply, Mr Robertson refused to apologise, and claimed the Scottish
Labour leader was under pressure from his party to withdraw his
objections to the Committee's appearance in Aberdeen.
He dismissed the suggestion that logistical considerations for the 49
Scottish Labour MPs made it difficult to arrange the session at short
notice. ''Can you name any occasion when all 49 Labour members of the
Grand Committee have been present at one of its meetings?''

<HEADLINE>MPs' inquiry  recommends sweeping reforms in jobs agency Enterprise told it must open up</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Enterprise last night promised a new era of ''openness''
after the powerful Commons Scottish Affairs Committee acknowledged great
concern that the network is secretive and run by self-appointed cliques.
The agency -- charged with generating jobs and prosperity -- faces 22
main recommendations for reform following the parliamentary inquiry into
its workings in distributing #464m-a-year to 13 Local Enterprise
Companies.
The committee's findings are a mixed bag of praise and condemnation
for the network, whose job creation claims, in particular, are now
subject to intense scrutiny.
The MPs declined to accept SE's claims of creating 40,000 jobs a year.
They believe the true figure is between 18,000 and 22,000.
Proposals for reform range from replacing Lec directors with ''young,
active people,'' to ensure the companies do not stagnate, to keeping a
rigorous check on ''kite-flying exercises'' that inflate the success of
projects.
The committee ruled it was still too early to give a verdict on the
effectiveness of Lecs, but the impression was that the system was
''working reasonably well.''
However, the MPs were adamant that Scottish Enterprise must become
more accountable and open, with their greatest criticisms levelled at
public accountability.
Their five-month inquiry was announced after The Herald published
extensive details of directors' interests in contracts and grants
awarded by the local enterprise companies. It also followed concern
about issues such as public accountability within the Lecs.
Committee chairman Labour MP Willie McKelvey, launching the report,
emphasised yesterday that the inquiry neither sought nor found specific
examples of wrongdoing, of corruption, or conflicts of interests.
The committee seemed satisfied that current arrangements for
declarations of interests provide adequate safeguards. Members also
found accusations that the network was ''a honeypot'' for consultants
were not as overwhelming as anecdotal evidence had suggested.
The main concern was that Lecs become less secretive and more open,
and that those who feel they have been been treated unfairly have a
means of redress.
Mr McKelvey argued there was no reason why the open approach recently
developed by Highlands and Islands Enterprise cannot be applied by SE.
However, he also suggested that Scottish Enterprise's top two --
chairman, Professor Donald MacKay, and chief executive Crawford
Beveridge -- were against such a policy.
The Labour MP said Professor MacKay seemed to believe the present
system of accountability was sufficient, and Mr Beveridge had told the
committee he ''would be surprised if we could get evidence which says we
need to go much further.''
The 11-strong committee, which has a Tory majority, found ''none of
the arguments against more openness in SE are overwhelming,'' and added
the benefits of a ''culture of openness'' would pay great dividends.
Last night, SE officials insisted the network was accountable to
Parliament for every penny spent, and that its openness will soon be
equivalent or better to that of HIE.
Professor MacKay, in a statement, insisted most of the recommendations
have already been implemented or are under active review. He added:
''With regard to openness, the most recent annual reports of Lecs put
much more detailed information into the public domain, and we are
working on a procedure that will be equivalent or better than that
developed by HIE.''
Professor MacKay welcomed the recommendation that an independent
adjudicator be appointed to investigate complaints against SE. The
committee had expressed concern that the network acts as judge and jury
in dealing with complaints internally.
It also questioned the lack of autonomy and flexibility within Lecs
while while training budgets were ''overwhelmingly'' tied to national
schemes.
Last night, several Lecs said they will act on any recommendations by
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, now studying the report. He has six months
to prepare a response.

<TEXT>
EFFORTS to track down the fortune of Britain's biggest Civil Service
fraudster are still going on, even though he has been behind bars for
nearly a year, a committee of MPs was told at Westminster last night.
The attempt to trace money amassed by former Defence Ministry official
Gordon Foxley was outlined to the powerful public spending watchdog, the
Public Accounts Committee, by Chief of Defence Procurement Dr Malcolm
McIntosh.
He said: ''I am told, and I have no pride in this, that Mr Foxley is
the largest individual case of fraud in Government circles -- ever.''
Foxley, former Director of Ammunition Procurement, was jailed for four
years last May for accepting bribes thought to be worth more than #3m
from foreign companies in exchange for arms contracts.
A ''great deal'' of the money had been put in Swiss bank accounts, Dr
McIntosh told the MPs, but investigators had been unable to get access
to the accounts so far.
An initial attempt had been rebuffed by the Swiss authorities on the
grounds no crime had been committed in Switzerland: ''We are still
trying.''
Dr McIntosh added that the MoD did not have ''anything like'' all the
documents involved in Foxley's frauds.
The committee was considering a National Audit Office report on fraud
which stated that Foxley, whose salary was about #50,000 a year, owned
nine houses and several cars.
Foxley worked at the Ministry for 32 years and retired in 1984 but
investigations did not start until 1989. His appeal against conviction
was turned down in February this year.
The NAO report said: ''Legal action is under way to recover
substantial sums and further civil actions may arise.''
Foxley is subject to a confiscation order for #1.5m. If the money is
not paid, he will serve another three years behind bars.
Meanwhile, lawyers reportedly were paid #160,000 in legal aid to
defend him.
Committee chairman Robert Sheldon (Ashton-under-Lyne -- Lab.) said the
case was one of the worst ever to come before MPs and he compared it to
the Marconi shares scandal before the First World War which involved
Liberal statesman David Lloyd George.
Dr McIntosh, who has been in his present post for four years, said the
hospitality rules had been ''tightened very dramatically even during my
tenure''.

LIBERAL Democrats last night seized on Commons comments by Railways
Minister John Watts to step up their campaign to save threatened
Scottish sleeper services.
Mr Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye), demanding an urgent
Government statement, claimed that Mr Watts had thrown the issue into
confusion.
Liberal Democrat Transport spokesman Paul Tyler asked at Question Time
if the Minister agreed with a Scottish Railtrack chief that should
sleeper services be axed in any part of the country ''this would reflect
badly and tarnish the privatisation exercise''.
Mr Watts told him: ''Stop arousing unnecessary fears in the minds of
your constituents and those of Scottish MPs.
''You know very well that sleeper services to the West Country and
Scotland will be safeguarded for the very first time in passenger
service requirements.''
Mr Kennedy, calling later for a statement at Westminster said: ''This
latest twist to the tale only adds to the confusion and developing sense
of chaos.''

THE Government yesterday announced a compromise over its controversial
proposals to widen the M25 -- which contains one of the busiest
stretches in Europe.
It scrapped plans to turn part of it into a 14-lane superhighway, but
announced that some sections will have 10 or 12 lanes.
Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney said a number of factors had
changed since the Government had decided to look at the link roads
option, including ''good progress'' with rail privatisation.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher welcomed the move ''to
abandon the Government's madcap scheme,'' but the AA said the decision
sentenced the UK to a future of mammoth traffic jams on its busiest road
link.

A LABOUR Government may require employers to provide each employee
with five days of training a year and workers to contribute to a special
account aimed at upgrading their skills.
In a speech to Training and Enterprise Council directors last night,
Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman also disclosed that the party
is consulting unions and employers on a range of ideas to achieve a
''skills revolution'' and will publish its proposals soon.
Options include a revised training levy under which firms would
provide training or pay into a skills fund in much the same way that the
industrial training boards were financed before they were all but wiped
out in favour of a totally voluntary system.
Ms Harman denied that Labour was watering down its last General
Election manifesto pledge to make all employers invest a minimum amount
on training their workforce.
''We want to develop a learning culture which reaches everyone. What
we are not open to consultation on is whether the current system should
stay because voluntarism has not worked,'' she said.
Labour was not moving away from its commitment to end the present
voluntary system on training but wanted to ''modernise'' its policy to
suit the changing labour market.
One prominent idea is to give every worker the entitlement to five
days a year -- similar to teachers' in-service days -- for training
courses, with firms giving staff time off.
Under another plan, employers and employees would pay into a special
account to be spent on training. One example given was for employers to
put up a minimum of #2 a week and employees 50p to each employees'
account, which could then be spent on accredited training or an employee
might opt to spend his or her own conbtribution on ''portable''
training.
''We are not watering down or fudging the issue. We are embarking on a
serious consultation exercise and so far we have been astounded at the
level of interest in this,'' said Ms Harman who earlier had pointed to
Britain's poor record on training.

<RECORDNO>979058935</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government's decision to cut pools betting duty was welcomed in
the Commons last night as a boost for the industry, which is facing
competition from the National Lottery.
The tax is being cut from 37.5% to 32.5% -- worth about #30m in
1995-96.
Ministers confirmed the change by introducing changes to the Finance
Bill, which enacts last November's Budget.
In the measure's report stage debate,
Paymaster General David Heathcoat-Amory acknowledged that the pools
companies had been hit by the ''great success of the National Lottery''.
However, he added: ''We don't know how the situation will develop in
the longer term.''
Pressed by MPs concerned about the future of the pools companies, he
promised: ''We will of course keep the matter under review.''
Mr Heathcoat-Amory said the reduction in duty had been asked for by
the pools companies.
It would enable pools firms to continue contributing to the Football
Trust, which supports improvements to grounds, and the Foundation for
Sport and the Arts.
For Labour, Hilary Armstrong said: ''We welcome this move by the
Government.
She added: ''We do know that the pools have been suffering
particularly. I hope that the Government will keep a very close eye on
this.
''The British public will be horrified if the lottery company makes
such excessive profits while charities are seen to be failing because of
the activities of the lottery.''
Emphasising that many of the jobs in the pools industry had been lost
already, Mrs Armstrong said; ''It was important that steps were taken
now both to protect the charity, the good works arm of the lottery, but
also to protect the industry.''

By Our Chief Reporter
THE LONG-awaited report by the Scottish Affairs Committee makes
bitter-sweet reading for those charged with generating jobs and
prosperity.
For outside parties, it probably is something of a damp squib, given
the severe criticisms of operations that led to the inquiry.
However, the committee did urge reforms and acknowledged the ''great
concern'' over the Scottish Enterprise network's accountability and
secrecy when carrying out tasks.
In particular, the MPs want openness, changes to membership, and,
above all, an independent complaints procedure to overcome considerable
disquiet that Scottish Enterprise is both judge and jury when handling
complaints under the present system.
Presenting the report, chairman Willie McKelvey, Labour MP for
Kilmarnock and Loudoun, said: ''Our concern was to ensure that Lecs
(local enterprise companies) became less secretive and more open, and
that those who feel they have been treated unfairly have a means of
redress.''
The impression formed by the committee of 11 MPs -- six Tories, three
Labour, and one each from the SNP and Liberal Democrats -- was that,
overall, the system works well.
However, the MPs found that Scottish Enterprise, whose 1995-96 budget
is up 3.5% to #464.6m, has lacked ''robustness'' in analysing its impact
on employment.
They recommended that the agency and Highlands and Islands Enterprise
now audit a proportion of Lec projects each year to overcome any doubts
on measuring job creation.
Senior Scottish Enterprise sources last night signalled their
willingness to work to the report's findings.
One SE official argued that the tone set at the news conference was in
contrast to the committee's findings, but also emphasised that there was
no genuine criticisms of the network's role in delivering jobs and
prosperity.
He added the recommendations involve changes in process rather than
output, which SE ''could live with.'' The move to appoint an independent
Ombudsman was welcomed, although the official argued many complaints
come from businesses whose applications for financial aid were rejected.
The source insisted: ''We are stewards of the public purse, and would
be hammered if we dished out money willy-nilly.''
The committee's greatest criticisms were levelled over public
accountability, especially secrecy surrounding activities -- including
director's interests when contracts or grants are awarded to companies
whose officials also are on Lec boards.
With regard to fears that directors could have an adverse influence,
the committee seemed satisfied that declarations of interests -- and
their absence from specific decisions -- are safeguards.
However, the report recommended an overhaul of membership because Lec
boards were ''self-selecting'' and local authorities, in particular,
were under-represented.
Accusations that the network was a honeypot for consultants were not
proved.
However, it was believed ''too cosy relationships'' may have been
developed, and the committee emphasised that proper procedures must be
followed with competitive tendering for consultancy work adopted at all
times.
The committee was adamant that, at the start of the inquiry, it was
fair to describe SE as ''a rather secretive organisation.'' A register
of directors' interests was, for example, available for public
inspection, but not published . . . ''was kept from public view.''
The committee agreed it would be unreasonable to suggest that board
members, unpaid for services, put their companies at a competitive
disadvantage in order to perform that service.
It welcomed a change of policy in which each annual report will now
make public anything a director obtains for any organisation of which he
is a part.
However, that still did not go far enough -- the committee said the
policy can ''only represent a transitional stage in a move to complete
openness.''
On jobs, the committee said SE was willing to put its name to 40,000
jobs in each of years since its creation, although that estimate was
''hedged with caution.'' The committee suspects the real figure may drop
to 18,000 once additionality or displacement is taken into account.
Mr Beveridge told the committee that ''there have been many cases
where, because people expect us to have job creation targets, we have
tended to use them sometimes in an inappropriate way.''
As for complaints, the MPs pointed out there was no recourse to
external scrutiny. The committee recommended an independent adjudicator
be appointed: ''It is, in our view, essential that whatever form the
adjudication takes, it is both swift and wholly independent.,''
Mr McKelvey warned that another inquiry into the network will be held,
if necessary. However, he hinted that parliamentary scrutiny tended to
make organisations put their house in order.
He promised a political battle if the Scottish Secretary fails to take
up the committee's recommendations.
* SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday announced the appointment of
two new members to the board of Scottish Enterprise.
They are Ms Celia Urquhart, chief executive of CU Developments, and
Sir Ian Wood, chairman and managing irector of the John Wood Group.

A FORMER beater, who stole rifles and shotguns worth thousands of
pounds from a castle's outbuilding, was jailed for two years yesterday.
At Aberdeen Sheriff Court, Stanley Beattie, 44, a barman, of St
Bryde's Court, Lhanbryde, Aberdeenshire, admitted stealing three
shotguns, two rifles with telescopic sights, a quantity of shotgun
cartridges and three fishing rods from an outbuilding at Beldorney
Castle, Glass, Huntly, last August.
He also admitted 14 previous convictions.
Depute fiscal Miss Fiona Murray told the court that the items had been
stolen after locks were forced. The two missing rifles were minus their
bolts and the total value of the items was estimated at #9180.
Police searching the castle grounds the next day found 33 shotgun
cartridges and an air rifle in a ditch. They also received information
that Beattie had been trying to sell two rifles without bolts. When
questioned, Beattie offered to show them where the goods were hidden,
but they had gone.
It transpired that a passer-by followed a trail of oil into woods,
found the weapons in plastic bags and contacted the police. Beattie had
worked at the castle as a beater.
Defence agent Graeme Morrison said his client had been unemployed and
short of money at the time he committed the theft. He had been aware
there were a number of valuable items in the shed.

LABOUR'S record on hijacking places on public bodies for its own
councillors was attacked yesterday by Scottish Liberal Democrat leader
Jim Wallace.
Publishing a report, Municipal Quangoism -- Labour's Council Placemen,
the Liberal Democrats made a direct comparison with the way in which the
Conservatives have been accused of packing public bodies with supporters
during their years in government.
''The Tories have been rightly lambasted for appointing party placemen
to central government quangos,'' said Mr Wallace.''These figures show
that Labour's record in local government is equally lamentable.''
The dossier tracked appointments of councillors to bodies such as the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, consumer groups, arts
organisations, conservation bodies, and joint boards.
In Hamilton district, Labour -- with 52% of the vote -- had taken 98%
of such places, while in Dumbarton where, with 32%, it polled less than
the Conservatives, it took 70% of places. In Cunninghame, on the basis
of a 44% vote, it took 86% of outside appointments.
In Central region, a 47% vote is used to justify 86% of outside
places, while on Cosla itself Labour, with 43% of Scottish councillors,
took almost 60% of seats.
Mr Wallace said: ''These figures show Labour is as guilty as the
Tories of eroding democracy in Scotland. Labour's municipal quangoism is
as stultifying and undemocratic as the Tories' record at national level.
''If Tony Blair is serious about reforming the Labour Party he should
start by setting his Scottish local government house in order. The
important thing about Thursday is that we are setting up new councils,
and here is a chance to do something fresh with them, in a spirit of
openness and pluralism.''

LABOUR'S deputy leader, John Prescott, said in Glasgow yesterday that
the Tory party had lied about tax cuts in the past, when he was asked
his reaction to claims that the Government would adopt a policy of
cutting taxes in the next three years.
''Clearly the Tories lied about taxes before. Why should they stop
now?'' he said.
Mr Prescott was in the West of Scotland to meet candidates in
Thursday's local authority elections, and to shake hands with the voting
public.
He even tried his hand at driving when he took an Adtrailer, urging
people to vote for Labour, for a spin around Glasgow's George Square.
Candidates for Thursday's election stood well clear, wisely avoiding the
possibility of a hastily arranged byelection.
Mr Prescott said it was important to remind people to go out and vote
on Thursday. Scotland would lead the way, he said, with Labour
victories, which would give momentum to Labour in the English local
elections in a month's time.
It would be a vote not only for Labour councils, but an opportunity to
vote against an incompetent and very unpopular Government, he said.

A LABOUR councillor in Kilsyth has been reported to the
procurator-fiscal after an incident on Saturday when a rival Scottish
National Party candidate alleged he was assaulted.
Police confirmed last night that Mr Francis Griffin, 35, a councillor
for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council's Bantone/Kilsyth Central
ward, was the subject of a report to the fiscal after an incident
involving SNP candidate Mr Colin Johnstone.
Mr Johnstone, who is standing against Mr Griffin for a seat in the
Croy ward of the new North Lanarkshire authority, claimed yesterday he
was electioneering on Saturday lunchtime in Kilsyth's King Street when
the incident occurred.
The 22-year-old, fighting his first election, said yesterday he had
been sitting in the driving seat of an SNP transit van, accompanied by
two other activists, with the window wound down when he was attacked.
''I had just finished talking on the Tannoy about the Monklands Mafia
when I was punched in the face,'' the advertising salesman alleged.
''I was totally shocked and couldn't really believe it,'' he added.
Mr Griffin, a distant relative of Mr Johnstone, was unavailable for
comment at his Kilsyth detached house.
A Scottish Labour Party spokeswoman said senior party officials would
be launching an investigation into the circumstances of the incident.
Mr Johnstone also accused some Labour sympathisers in the area, which
is seen as a heartland for the party, of conducting ''a dirty tricks''
campaign after the SNP's initials and symbol were daubed, three feet
high, across a row of cottages in the nearby village of Queenzieburn
early yesterday morning.
A bus stop across from the cottages had been similarly marked in
bright yellow paint.
''We were horrified when we found this had happened,'' said Mr
Johnstone last night.
Retired factory worker Mrs Janet Stewart, 80, woke yesterday morning
to find the ''N'' of SNP daubed to the right of her front door.
She said: ''Whoever did this must have come very early in the morning.
I was really shocked when I woke up.''
Mr Johnstone visited the residents yesterday morning to assure them
the SNP were not responsible and last night a number of SNP volunteers
removed the markings.
He was careful however not to accuse the local Labour party of any
involvement in the paint-daubing, contenting himself with speculating
that the culprits were ''obviously sympathetic'' but not making any
specific allegations against individuals.
That stance was attacked by a Labour Party spokesperson, who said:
''It's typical of the SNP to consider Labour the enemy. They would be
far better fighting the Tories and removing them from Scotland's
councils.''

THE Scottish National Party yesterday accused Labour of blatant
hypocrisy in its actions in local government.
Mr Gordon Wilson, SNP vice-president, speaking in Edinburgh, said that
Labour was ganging up with the Tories -- an ''infamous coalition'' --
against the SNP minority administration in Tayside Regional Council
because they were determined to destabilise the region.
Because of Government cuts, Tayside had been forced to reduce its
social work budget by #1.5m. The SNP had tried to introduce sliding
scale charges, improving on a system which operated in Labour-controlled
Strathclyde.
Yet Labour in Tayside had opposed the proposal, without offering a
credible alternative of raising the money.
Mr Wilson said that elsewhere in Scotland, Labour councils were
cutting deeper and harder.
Strathclyde had made massive cuts in its social work budget, including
a cut of #500,000 from children's homes.
Lothian had targeted the elderly by increasing charges for home helps,
lunch clubs, and meals on wheels. And Central had cut #1.2m from its
social work budget, he said.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, SNP parliamentary leader, in a statement issued in
Edinburgh, accused Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson of
hypocrisy by attacking Grampian region, where the SNP shared
administration, yet keeping silent about Labour-controlled Central
region, which she said was setting up deals to sell off #30m of
industrial assets.
* The SNP last night made a party election broadcast which offered
electors a ''fresh start for Scotland'' and said SNP-run councils worked
better. It accused Labour councils of providing jobs for the boys and
taking decisions behind closed doors.

A JUDGE yesterday rejected an attempt by two Conservative candidates
to ban a #100,000 anti-Government advertising campaign by the trade
union Unison.
MsFiona Walker, a candidate in Edinburgh, and Mr James Donnelly,
standing in Aberdeen, argued that the poster and newspaper campaign by
the union contravened the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
The union has paid for 363 posters in Scotland's major towns and
cities plus forthcoming advertisements in Scotland's national
newspapers, including The Herald.
One advert states: ''The Government has crossed us often enough. Now
it's our turn. Vote on April 6th.'' The second reads: ''We can't accuse
the Government of never thinking about Scotland. Use your vote on April
6th.''
The second advert is accompanied by a picture of John Major with think
bubbles saying: ''Water Sell-off'' and ''Boundary Changes''.
Mr Charles McFarlane, QC, for the candidates, told Lord Abernethy at
the Court of Session that, according to the 1983 Act, no expenses with a
view to getting a candidate elected should be incurred other than by the
candidate or election agent without the agent's authorisation.
In this case the union, which was not a party to the election, was
seeking to sway the result by disparaging the Conservative candidates in
general and the two candidates in particular, as well as trying to
secure the election of other candidates.
Mr McFarlane also asked the judge for an order to remove, deface or
obliterate the offending posters.
Mr Andrew Hardie, QC, dean of the faculty, for Unison, said the issue
was whether the 1983 Act banned spending on advertisements designed to
support or criticise a particular political party in general terms in
all constituencies at a time when there were elections throughout the
country.
Mr Hardie argued that it did not.
Unison was involved in a general campaign as opposed to a campaign
directed towards a particular constituency far less the constituencies
of the two particular candidates.
Mr Hardie told the court that the 363 posters, costing #65,000, had
been on display for most of last week and it would take 48-hours to
remove them at an additional cost of #27,000.
The newspaper adverts, which had already been paid for, had cost
#35,345.
Refusing to grant interim interdict, Lord Abernethy said that the
Unison adverts formed a generalised attack during elections taking place
throughout Scotland in which national political parties were deeply
involved.
What the Act prohibited was spending designed to support a particular
candidate in a particular consitituency.

THE Treasury Secretary, Mr Jonathan Aitken, lit the fuse that sparked
''Panorammy'' last week when he accused the BBC -- the ''Blair
Broadcasting Corporation'' as he called it -- of anti-Tory bias.
However, the broadside had only just exploded in the BBC camp when the
corporation found itself under attack from another quarter. This time
the bombardier with Broadcasting House in its sights was Labour.
Labour accused the BBC of collapsing in the face of Government
intimidation by planning to show an interview with John Major on
Panorama on Monday -- three days before the Scottish local elections.
The accusation followed a leaked memo which revealed the extraordinary
steps taken by the corporation to avoid charges of bias.
The memorandum from the Panorama programme's deputy editor, Mr Nick
Robinson, to other senior BBC staff revealed the level of concern within
the corporation over the possibility of Opposition accusations that Mr
Major was receiving preferential treatment only three days before the
Scottish polls and in the run-up to the local elections in England and
Wales in May.
The memo suggested the BBC should claim it had a long-standing request
to Downing Street for an interview, which it had renewed three weeks
ago.
This was designed to counter accusations that the corporation was
being used by Downing Street in a Government propaganda offensive,
including a series of speeches by Mr Major this week and a meeting with
President Clinton in Washington.
The internal memo, whose authenticity was confirmed by the BBC, said:
''Before publicising the interview, I think that we (and the press
office) need to have an answer prepared to the inevitable question:
'When are you going to interview Tony Blair, Paddy Ashdown or Alex
Salmond?'
''My suggestion is that we say we have had a bid in for the Prime
Minister for some months which he has finally accepted; that this is an
interesting time to interview him since it comes in advance of the
beginning of the Maastricht 2 process, his visit to the United States
and the imminent talks between the Government and Sinn Fein; and given
the Government's continuing unpopularity and disarray.''
The corporation also claimed that the memo had been written before Mr
Aitken's onslaught. It then went on the offensive about its decision to
go ahead with the programme.
As Labour urged the BBC to abandon the 40-minute encounter between Mr
Major and David Dimbleby, and replace it with a programme giving equal
billing to all political leaders, the BBC justified the interview,
saying it was ''a major news story at a critical time''.
Mr Chris Smith, the Shadow National Heritage Secretary, said that it
was obvious from the leaked memorandum, that the BBC was worried that
the requirement for balance was being eroded.
He said: ''Indeed, it is obvious to me that balance is being eroded,
particularly given that the BBC rescheduled an edition of Panorama on
Westminster Council in the run-up to last year's local elections on the
ground that impartiality was required.''
Mr Smith called for Mr Blair, Mr Ashdown, and Mr Salmond to join Mr
Major in the programme.
The BBC replied that the memo ''was written after we had considered
how to ensure that the BBC is fair, and is seen to be fair, across the
whole range of our coverage. As always, we will ensure that all parties
are fairly represented in the election campaign''.
Labour then threatened the BBC with legal action if it did not drop
plans to broadcast the interview. The party claimed that Mr Major's
scheduled appearance on the programme would breach the corporation's own
guidelines for producers about political balance.
The party's legal advisers had suggested that the BBC would be liable
to judicial review if it broke the impartiality undertaking annexed to
the corporation's licence agreement.
The threat to go to court was issued in a letter from Mr Alastair
Campbell, press secretary to Mr Blair, to managing director of news and
current affairs, Mr Tony Hall.
In a flurry of correspondence between the two, the BBC flatly refused
to scrap the interview. There was only one way left open to sort out the
''Panorammy''.
With the ball firmly in the Court of Session, Lord Abernethy yesterday
granted an interdict to Labour and the Liberal Democrats banning the
programme.

TORY hopes of a commitment now to cut taxes over the next three years
were squashed by the Prime Minister last night in his controversial BBC
Panorama interview.
''We haven't remotely got the figures to make any judgments like that
yet and it'll be a long time before the Chancellor will be in a position
to make any judgment about the Budget in November,'' he said.
His Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, goes before the very back benchers
who are demanding this commitment at a meeting in the Commons tonight.
His party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, said on Sunday: ''I see no reason
why the Chancellor should not consider any tax goal that would take more
than a year to achieve.''
Mr Major last night made it clear that he, as well as the Chancellor,
will decide if and when tax cuts are to come, and how much they should
be, and how far before a General Election -- which he wants in two
years' time.
But he did not rule out the prospect of going to the voters at the
next General Election with the prospect of a 20p basic rate following
two Budgets that have moved the rate down in that direction. He forecast
around 3% economic growth over the next two years, making a cumulated
10% growth rate over three years, creating more resources.
Tax cuts are coming, he insisted again, as soon as it is prudent. He
stressed that there would be two Budgets before the next election.
''We're not storing up money for tax cuts. If and when we're able to
produce tax cuts as the economy produces, we will do so. We haven't got
a hip pocket in which we put money to one side specifically for tax
cuts.''
He added: ''So there are going to be more resources available. Now
they aren't all going to be used in tax cuts. They aren't all going to
be used in expenditure. I think either proposition would be grotesque.
So there will be a balance between the two. I can certainly say to
people it is our instinct to cut taxes when it is prudent to do so. We
are not a Conservative Government that believes in taking money from you
that we don't have to.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said last night: ''The Prime Minister
promises a two-stage tax cut. The Tory party chairman has promised a
three-stage tax cut. And the Chancellor, for once, is silent. They
cannot even get their act together on this.
''And the people of Britain will find it extraordinary that, in the
week they are being hit by two more Tory tax rises, and with the Prime
Minister forced to admit teachers face the sack, he should expect them
to believe his latest promises of tax cuts. The truth is that the Tories
will never be trusted on tax again.''
The Panorama interview, which was shown south of the Border, was
wide-ranging. Mr Major used it to attack Mr Tony Blair's new modern
Labour Party for dismantling its past. ''Labour's soul has gone. The
things they cared about, the things they fought for, they've apparently
gone. They now have moved over to the values that people have accepted
for the last four elections and I think will accept for the fifth
election -- essentially Tory values.''
He indulged in blatant electioneering: ''If you have to choose between
a real Conservative Party and a quasi-Conservative Party where the
Labour Party says one thing but the party's heart and soul is elsewhere,
then I believe people will go for the real thing.''
He shrugged off divisions within the Tory party on Britain's future in
Europe, saying that these divisions were shared by the Labour Party.
Again he rejected the possibility of a single European currency before
the 21st century, but again, he refused to do what his Tory rebels
require, reject a single currency for ever.
Mr Major said: ''No-one has ever said that we can give a guarantee
that there will never a single currency. That has not been the
Government's position at any stage.''
He also insisted, when pressed: ''If I had to choose, if I thought it
would damage the nation's state I would choose the nation state. That is
the position of the Conservative Party. That has always been the
position of the Conservative Party.''
He insisted that his Cabinet is now united on this issue. ''Michael
Portillo and every other member of the Cabinet agree precisely with the
line I set out in the House of Commons recently.'' Mr Clarke also takes
the same view now.
The Prime Minister also said that he expects to remain leader and that
the Government will to go its full five-year term before an election. He
answered criticisms of his leadership this way: ''The things we have
been doing are long-term. We set out deliberately to make them
long-term. That does mean that the pay-off is longer term in public
perception of what we have been seeking to achieve. I could have sought,
from time to time, fairly cheap and populist measures. I could have put
aside decisions that needed to be taken in order to remain popular. But
I choose not to do that.''
He chose the ''old fashioned'' course of doing what he thought to be
right. ''Even if the reward of doing it is very long term, you have an
absolute obligation to do it whether you are popular or not. And if I
were popular today I would not have done what I should have done over
the last three years. I'll let people judge me at the General
Election.''
Panorama hit him again on two other key problems -- the fate of
teachers in the money made available to local authorities who pay them
and the controversy over the salaries and share options of the directors
of privatised utility companies. He repeated that the Government is now
prepared to legislate if necessary to give shareholders increased powers
to curtail excesses. And the same mistakes will not be made in the
privatisation of British Rail.
''We have rail privatisation coming up and we will have learned from
what has happened as we proceed with rail privatisation.'' He added: ''I
don't think we have changed course. We have acknowledged a public
concern. I think some people went too far. The private sector has
responsibilities to its shareholders.'' He hopes to be able to put the
situation right when he gets the Greenbury Report.
It was pointed out to Mr Major that two former Tory education
Ministers abstained in the vote last week on the issue of funds for
education and teachers' pay. Mr Major claimed that expenditure on
education has soared. ''If you take the spending per pupil, it has
soared by over 50% since 1979. Expenditure on books and equipment has
soared by over 50% since '79. So let's get it in context. We set a
target -- I'm talking of education in the round -- of getting one in
three of our young people into university by the turn of the century. We
will hit that target this year.''
He queried the validity of savings being imposed on teachers in the
classroom, rather than in other areas of education expenditure. ''Why is
it the teacher first, before looking at what other savings may be made?
Any government is entitled to ask -- and I do ask -- that question. I'm
not sure whether teachers will be sacked. Local education authorities
will have to make their own choice of priorities within their budget.
That's what they're there for. It is the taxpayers' money and we expect
them to choose their priorities.'' There will be a dividend for both
taxpayers and teachers as the economy grows.
Mr Major also tackled head-on the ''sleaze'' factor that has plagued
his Government over several years -- but he was considerate towards the
13 members of his Government who have left for a variety of personal
reasons since the 1992 General Election. ''I expect members of the
Government to bahave themselves. I expect people to set a standard, of
course,'' he said.
But he added: ''I know the people concerned. I see a more rounded
picture of them than the rather bowdlerised version that so often
appeared when they ran into difficulties. We are not a court of morals.
I expect people to have high public standards and I can understand that
people are upset by some of the behaviour they saw. But that is not
typical of politicians generally. It is not typical of the Conservative
Party or the Conservative Government. It is a side issue to the
substantive things that we are trying to achieve for this country.''
The controversial interview on Panorama last night certainly gave the
Prime Minister 40 minutes of valuable air time. But, apart from his his
mood on tax cuts and a committed running programme to establish them, he
did not tell the nation south of the Border much more than they already
knew form his speeches and statements in the Commons.

FOLLOWING Lord Abernethy's ruling, the BBC faced immense technical
difficulties over whether to screen the Panorama interview in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland without breaching the Court of Session
interdict in Scotland.
With transmitters in Cumbria, Northumberland and Ulster, and an
estimated one million Scots receiving their BBC programmes from
transmitters or relay stations outwith Scotland, the screening appeared
intractable without blacking out large areas of Northern England and
Ireland.
Lord Abernethy specifically refused an application by the BBC in court
yesterday for the interdict to only apply to transmissions from Scottish
transmitters.
Viewers in the Borders and Dumfriesshire receive programmes from the
English transmitters, while those in Galloway, parts of Ayrshire and
large tracts of Argyll -- particularly Kintyre and Knapdale -- receive
Irish TV.
For an hour and a half BBC lawyers and technical buffs argued over the
logistics of broadcasting and ''overlapping transmissions'' without
infringing the interdict.
At 8pm a BBC spokeswoman said the corporation was standing by its
plans and said: ''The programme will be broadcast in England and Wales
-- transmitters do not follow geographic boundaries.''
But within 20 minutes the appeal was lodged and the three Scottish
judges were on their way to the Court of Session.
An hour later, following the appeal judges' decision to uphold the
ban, the BBC relinquished its hard line decision and opted for limited
transmission to the South of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and Wales.
A BBC spokesman said: ''We cannot transmit from anywhere in Northern
England where the programme may be picked up in Scotland without
breaking the law.
''Transmissions from Northern Ireland were also halted for similar
reasons.''

MR JOHN Major yesterday stepped up the pressure on Sinn Fein's Gerry
Adams over the decommissioning of IRA weapons.
He was on the steps of the British Embassy during his visit to
Washington when he hit back directly at comments made by Mr Adams in a
BBC television interview yesterday morning.
Mr Adams said he had no confidence in Mr Major's handling of the peace
process so far and that he could learn lessons from President Clinton.
Hitting back, Mr Major told reporters: ''I am less concerned about Mr
Adams's opinion than about Sinn Fein deciding they will come and talk
about decommissioning. The important thing now is that Sinn Fein honour
what they have been implying for some time, that they decide they mean
what they say, they come along, they engage in constructive discussion
that leads to decommissioning of arms and taking them out of Northern
Ireland politics.''
Mr Major meets Mr Clinton today against the background of the recent
row over the treatment given to Mr Adams in the US.
The Prime Minister said yesterday: ''I think it was a mistake that Mr
Adams was received as he was in the United States and I made that clear
to the United States.
''We are very close allies, we agree on very many things, we have a
similar outlook on all sorts of questions, a whole range of things right
across the world, but sometimes even the best of friends differ and on
the subject of Mr Adams's reception in the United States we differed and
that is a matter of record.''
During a busy day in Washington Mr Major held talks with Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and met Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole.
It emerged after the hour-long session with Mr Christopher that the
Americans are much closer to the British viewpoint that the arms embargo
on the Bosnian Muslims should not be lifted.
Before his meeting with Mr Clinton today, Mr Major will have breakfast
with Vice President Al Gore and a meeting with the right-wing senate
speaker, Mr Newt Gingrich.

BEER aficionados may not like it, but, according to an expert
professor, women are regarded as the best tasters of ales and lagers.
Professor Graham Stewart, at Heriot-Watt University's international
centre for brewing, said it is all about having a good nose for the
product, as in wine tasting -- or because women were the traditional
brewers in the past.
He was giving a lecture as part of the Edinburgh International Science
Festival last night about the latest designer beer, ''ice beer''.
Professor Stewart spent 25 years with the Canadian brewing company
which pioneered the drink, freezing the beer after fermentation to
produce a higher alcohol level.
The lecture took place at the Royal Museum of Scotland.

<TEXT>
A YOUNG mother yesterday relived the callous attack, early on Sunday
morning, which left her boyfriend lying in a pool of blood with stab
wounds to his back.
Mr David Kirkhope, 24, had gone to confront vandals who were damaging
his car outside the couple's home in Main Street, Shotts, Lanarkshire.
Yesterday, as he lay seriously ill in Law Hospital with deep stab
wounds, Ms Tracey Hollywood, 21, said: ''There are no words to describe
the person who did this to Davie. He is a gentle, kind person who loves
our children.
''He only went after the yobs who had smashed our car rear window
because he was sick and tired of our car being attacked.''
Last night, Motherwell district councillor David McKendrick, who
organises a neighbourhood watch on property and cars in nearby Newmains,
said: ''This is unbelievable. What kind of protection does the ordinary
person have from being knifed.
''People talk about arming the police. Maybe it's the public who
should be armed to defend themselves against attacks like this.''
Ms Hollywood said she was dozing in the living room of their home when
she heard a noise outside. The rear window of their Sierra Sapphire had
been smashed.
Mr Kirkhope followed as she chased the three alleged vandals along
Main Street.
She said: ''Suddenly, one of them -- a short, dark haired guy --
turned on Davie and wrestled him to the ground.
''I ran to the nearest house and told someone to call the police.
''Davie got up and staggered towards me, hunched over with his hands
in his pockets.
''I yelled at them, and the one who stabbed Davie came towards me. But
the others called him back.
''I could hear the air whooshing out of his back where he had been
stabbed in the lung.''
Ms Hollywood said the youths she had followed were aged between 18 and
19, and she had given detailed descriptions to police.
The couple's children, two-year-old Blue and Tiffany, six months, were
staying with their grandmother at the time of the stabbing.
She said their car had been the target for frequent attacks in recent
months. Tyres had been slashed, windows broken, and bodywork dented.
On several previous occasions, Mr Kirkwood had remonstrated with
youths he suspected.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the attack and say they are
treating the case as attempted murder.

CONSERVATIVE support in Scotland is in its worst ever trough as the
party faces this week's local elections, according to a System Three
poll for The Herald.
For the second successive month, and the third time in four polls this
year, the Tories have stalled at 11%, offering no evidence of the upturn
needed to stave off a disastrous showing in Thursday's election for
single-tier authorities.
As Scottish Secretary Ian Lang sought to rally support in Conservative
heartlands yesterday, informed party sources suggested their vote is
collapsing, even in what were previously strongholds. Party activists
from areas bordering the ''blue chip'' Eastwood District Council zone
which will form the largest part of the new East Renfrewshire, spoke of
a 50% drop in positive canvass returns.
Some Conservative party sources say failure in East Renfrewshire would
create waves beyond Scotland and could even have implications for Mr
Major's leadership.
Mr Lang was out meeting voters in East Renfrewshire himself yesterday,
and he emphasised: ''I believe local elections are about local issues.''
By implication, he is wanting voters to put national issues to the
back of their minds and vote on the records of local politicians. Mr
Lang insisted the party was getting a very good feedback in areas where
they are strong and control councils. Others in the party are not so
sure.
The possibility of losing four seats in Eastwood itself is a spectre
haunting Tories who would be surprised if they gained any success in the
new territories of Barrhead, Neilston and Uplawmoor that, along with
Eastwood, will make up the new East Renfrewshire.
Last June the Conservatives plumbed 10% in The Herald poll and hit 11%
in October but their run since January is by far the worst in 21 years
of System Three surveys for The Herald.
Labour is one point up, heading the poll at 53%, while the SNP remains
on 25%, the same as last month. The Scottish Liberal Democrats are down
one point to 9%, while the Greens record 1% support.
The tally for all parties has been very consistent since New Year,
with Labour pegged back only slightly from its highest score of 57% in
January and the SNP recovering three points, with both Conservatives and
Liberal Democrats virtually static.
The chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, Sir Michael Hirst, sought
to play down its significance. ''The poll was conducted before the most
intensive period of our unitary authority election campaign.
''Our findings on the doorsteps suggest that many people will reflect
on the waste and inefficiency of Labour councils and vote positively for
the Conservatives, who will provide better services and a lower council
tax.''
Labour's Scottish general secretary Jack McConnell said: ''The
Scottish Labour Party approaches these elections with confidence but not
complacency. We are taking nothing for granted and we will fight for
every vote between now and Thursday.'' He said the Conservatives were in
a ''desperate but deserved situation''.
He goaded the Nationalists for their inability to break through the
25% barrier, but SNP chief executive Michael Russell countered: ''We
have sustained the improvement in our rating since the start of the year
and our campaign is progressing extremely well.
''The Tories and Liberal Democrats are clearly out of the game now.
Poll after poll has shown that Scottish politics is a contest between
Labour and the SNP. We are getting a great reception on the doorsteps
throughout the country and expect to see that translated into a
significant level of support on Thursday.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrats said: ''This poll tells us nothing
really new. The real test of public opinion will be on Thursday and we
are looking forward to a good performance in those elections.''
* Tory support in Edinburgh, which was over 40% at the 1992 district
elections, has slumped to 16% according to a poll in the city's Evening
News conducted by Research Resources. Their telephone poll of 520 adults
was carried out on March 27 and 28.
Labour would appear to be on course for a more comfortable victory
than expected in the capital, up from 29% to 45% over the same period,
with the SNP on 19% pushing the Tories into third place. The Liberal
Democrats stand on 12%.

MR JIM Seaton has been appointed editor of the Scotsman. He succeeds
Mr Andrew Jaspan, who left to edit the Observer.
Mr Seaton, 59, has been deputy editor of the paper since January and
before that was senior assistant editor.
He trained as a reporter in Perth, and has been with the Scotsman
since 1960 apart from a two-year period with the Scottish Daily Mail.
He said last night: ''I can think of no greater privilege in
journalism than to be invited to edit this great newspaper.
''The paper's staff are the best in the business and well capable of
meeting the challenges of those papers forced to cut their prices to
hold their place in the market place.''

A DECISION by West of Scotland health boards to send patients to two
private hospitals for heart operations is to be raised in Parliament.
A total of 35 patients are being given coronary by-passes as a result
of the deal -- seven from Glasgow, five from Lanarkshire, and three from
Argyll and Clyde are being treated at HCI in Clydebank and 20 others at
Ross Hall Hospital in Glasgow.
The chairman of Greater Glasgow Health Board, Sir Robert Calderwood,
said: ''All the patients involved have already waited nine months or
more. The initiative is designed to deal with a bulge in the list which
could prevent the board delivering the waiting time guarantee next year.
''We will only use the private sector in this way and where doing so
will not undermine the NHS.''
No patient was referred to the private sector without their agreement,
he added.
In February, Ayrshire and Arran Health Board struck a #200,000 deal
for 23 patients to have cardiac surgery at Ross Hall. In all the cases
it was stated that existing NHS facilities were working to full capacity
and could not take on the extra work, which is being farmed out to
ensure the Government's 12-month waiting time guarantee is met.
Labour's Scottish Health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, MP, said it was
''grotesque'' that money voted in Parliament to go to the NHS was being
used as a life-support for the HCI facility.
He said: ''It would not survive without this kind of subsidy. Only
6,200,000 people in the UK have private health insurance so the private
sector hospitals depend to a great extent on money being diverted from
the NHS.
''This is now the pattern right across the NHS, with the purchasers --
the health authorities and GP fundholders -- buying increasingly from
the private sector.''
Mr McAllion is to raise the matter in the Commons, and may seek the
names of the NHS cardiac surgeons who will be performing the work at
Ross Hall. HCI have an in-house surgeon, Dr Peter Van Zyl.
However, waiting-list initiatives of this nature normally involve
surgeons working for the NHS in private facilities, as opposed to
undertaking private employment.
Mr Jim Devine, regional organiser for health union Unison, said: ''We
are very concerned about this development, particularly against the
background of cuts taking place in Greater Glasgow and throughout
Scotland, where overall the number of acute beds is to be reduced from
15,000 to 10,000.
''I find it offensive that we are handing over public money to the
private sector, whose primary function is to make a profit out of
ill-health. It is ironic that surgeons who couldn't carry out these
operations in the Western Infirmary or Royal Infirmary will be carrying
out some of them in a private sector hospital.''
Mr Simon Skinner, director of patient services for Greater Glasgow
Health Board, said the contracts were part of an initiative by West of
Scotland boards to clear numbers following on from last year when the
Scottish Health Minister, Lord Fraser, announced a 12-month waiting list
guarantee.
He said: ''By the time the NHS hospitals had dealt with that there was
no capacity left; when we decided to clear a hump in the waiting list
with money that was left over at the end of the financial year, the NHS
hospitals could not take the work on. We had to go to the private sector
to ensure we met the 12-month guarantee.
''Now that purchasing heart surgery has been devolved to health
boards, the West of Scotland consortium, and others, have increased the
number of operations they are buying by three per cent over the next
financial year.
''That means the Western will be doing 900 and the Royal 930. Because
they are forewarned they will be able to gear up and engage staff so
that we should not need to turn to the private sector this time next
year.
''We have only used the private sector to deal with humps in the list
and that remains our policy.''
The cost of the contracts has not been disclosed but Mr Skinner said
they paid no more than the average MHS cost of a heart by-pass
operation, #6500. The two private hospitals made similar, though not
identical, bids.
Mr Rick Taylor, director of business development at HCI, said:
''Working together like this ensures timely treatment for the patients
and value for money for the health boards, which can only be a good
thing.''

SCOTS think the English are arrogant, snobbish and stuck-up, according
to a new university study of national stereotypes. The Sassenach bashing
does not end there: the study also found that the hooligan element ''has
come very strongly into the image''.
The survey by Strathclyde University's department of government said
people appear to find it fairly easy to conjure up national stereotypes,
despite their irrationality, nor is it the preserve of the
unsophisticated.
It says: ''The Scottish image of Englishness is extremely negative.
There were not many positive factors identified but an awareness of the
northern English as different -- more like the Scots -- was there.
''The traditional 'snobbish, arrogant, reserved, confident'
middle/upper class image of Englishness now sits rather uncomfortably
with a lager-lout, racist, materialistic Essex man type image.''
Ironically it is the phrase ''at national ease with itself'' conjured
up by that most English of Englishmen, John Major, that applies most
north of the Border.
The study, The Uses and Abuses of National Stereotypes, says the Scots
seem, on the whole, very comfortable and positive with their identity as
a friendly, warm, down-to-earth, patriotic, humorous people. ''They are
conscious of a touch of paranoia and low self esteem but these aren't
dominant in the image.''
It said the most striking difference from a major study 30 years ago
was that ''hard working'' or any other references associated with work
were rarely mentioned, but ''patriotism'' had become a more important
part of the image.
Despite the extremely negative image of Englishness there is little
evidence in Scotland of personalised hostility. In personal
relationships any show of anti-Englishness usually comes out as humorous
banter. Englishness is an abstraction, except for a few sporting and
political personalities.
In an attempt at explanation, the study says the smaller partner in
any relationship has to assert itself more strongly to maintain identity
and that means emphasising differences.
It warns: ''The image the Scots currently have of themselves may be
too uncritical but it does represent rather attractive and desirable
values. The image they have of the English, although very negative, has
not been problematic in direct relationships perhaps because of the very
virtues of friendliness which they regard as so important in themselves.
''But we should always be careful. Stereotypes can develop a dynamic
of their own and perhaps it's time to start painting nicer pictures of
the English.''
* The study of ''instant reaction'' responses from Scottish residents
of assorted backgrounds was based on the question: ''What
characteristics do you associate with English people and Scottish
people.''

BURUNDI troops and Tutsi gunmen massacred an estimated 400 Hutus --
mostly women and children -- in northeast Burundi last week, diplomats
and aid workers said yesterday.
0 US Ambassador Robert Krueger, who saw survivors in a hospital at the
weekend, said: ''It was a horrendous massacre. These weren't just people
caught up in the crossfire.''
The victimshad been shot, or slashed with knives and machetes, and hit
with stones.
The killings took place in the Gasorwe region but four wounded
children who survived were being cared for at the Government-run
hospital in the nearby town of Muyinga.
The ambassador said he knew of no official investigation into the
killings, and said parents of the children had told him the attackers
were Burundi soldiers.
One Western diplomat said: ''There is no question, this is genocide.''
He said he saw a one-year-old Hutu baby who had been bayoneted in her
genitals so she would never be able to bear children.
One 11-year-old boy who survived had been shot in the right cheek. The
bullet exited close to his left eye. Doctors said it was a miracle he
had survived an operation, but he would be blind in his left eye.
The doctors told reporters the boy had been left for 24- hours where
he fell before being brought nine miles to the hospital.
Another Hutu boy, 14, lay in a coma with head injuries. Relatives said
he had been hit by a rock wielded by a Tutsi.
The township of Gasorwe, 14 miles west of the border with Tanzania,
resembled a ghost town.There was virtually no-one on the streets and
shops and homes stood closed. No troops were present.
Tutsi residents of Muyinga said the Army was still hunting in the
Gasorwe area for Hutu gunmen.
Last week, hundreds of Hutus were killed by Tutsi gunmen in Burundi's
capital of Bujumbura.

IN A dramatic court cliffhanger, three Scottish judges pulled the plug
on the Prime Minister last night only minutes before the BBC was due to
broadcast a Panorama interview.
A second ban on the programme was confirmed at 9.20pm after a day of
unprecedented legal manoeuvring: it ended with three of the country's
leading judges called to the Court of Session from their homes.
Lord President Hope, sitting with Lords Murray and McCluskey, upheld
an earlier decision by Lord Abernethy that the BBC was in breach of its
duty to be fair to all political parties in the run-up to the local
elections on Thursday.
Lord Abernethy had earlier ruled that the 40-minute interview with Mr
Major would be in breach of the BBC's duty to be fair to all sides in
the local election campaign. However, the BBC had then lodged an
immediate appeal, which failed.
In another hearing, also related to the local elections, Lord
Abernethy, rejected a bid by two Tory candidates to ban an
anti-Government advertising campaign by the trade union Unison.
Last night BBC director general John Birt said: ''We don't believe the
courts should wish to substitute their judgment for the BBC's on a
matter of political impartiality. We are appealing against the judgment
and will seek to transmit the programme in Scotland tomorrow.''
The BBC is to seek leave to take the case to the House of Lords today.
Its decision to fight on angered the opposition MPs, whose mood was
summed up by Liberal Democrat Jim Wallace. He said Mr Birt ''should cut
his loses and accept that the BBC was wrong''.
The BBC's earlier appeal hearing began at 9pm. Because Panorama was
due to start at 9.30, Lord Hope allowed both sides only ten minutes each
to present their case. Then, after the judges conferred for just a few
seconds, Lord Hope said they were satisfied there was a prima facie case
to justify upholding Lord Abernethy's earlier ruling.
Mr Pat Chalmers, former BBC Controller in Scotland, and a candidate in
the local government elections, was one of the men who sought the
interim interdict against the BBC.
He commented afterwards: ''I'm delighted at this result. I worked for
the BBC in Scotland for 32 years and I'm ashamed of the way the BBC has
behaved on this. Questions have to be asked at the highest level in the
BBC about its conduct and the lack of action by the Broadcasting Council
for Scotland has to be examined.''
Mr George Robertson, Shadow Scottish Secretary, commented: ''I think
this has vindicated the decision taken by Labour and the Liberal
Democrats to come to this court today. All we sought was fairness and
balance in what is a crucial election campaign.''
Mr Wallace said: ''We believed that what the BBC was attempting to do
was a blatant breach of any attempt to be impartial. It was staring them
in the face.
''I regret very much that it has taken court action for the BBC to
face up to its responsibility for impartiality. It certainly bears the
hallmarks of BBC Scotland having to dance to a tune being played south
of the Border.''
The SNP, which earlier in the day had an application for a judicial
review to investigate the impartiality of the BBC's political
broadcasting upheld, was also upbeat about the interdict decision.
SNP leader Alex Salmond congratulated both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats for their court-room success, adding that the BBC was now ''on
the run''. He said: ''In a classic pincer movement, the anti-democratic
bias of the BBC management in London can be finished off by the SNP and
other opposition parties.''
However, Scottish Conservative Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst
condemned the opposition parties as ''thin-skinned'' and ''childish''
adding that the Panorama interview was irrelevant to the local
elections.
After a two-hour hearing at the Court of Session, Lord Abernethy said
that the case raised issues of very considerable importance and there
was no dispute that the BBC must act impartially so far as the various
political parties were concerned in the local election campaign.
The question was whether broadcasting an extensive interview with Mr
Major in which he would discuss the Government's record and national
issues less than three days before the elections without similar air
time being given to the other political leaders was a breach of that
duty.
Lord Abernethy said he took the view that an arguable case had been
made out that the BBC had breached its duty of impartiality.
He was also satisfied that
if he failed to grant an interim interdict banning Panorama, damage
which could not be undone would be done to Mr Chalmers, an SDP candidate
in Aberdeenshire and the other pursuer in the action, Mr Brian Houston,
standing for Labour in Edinburgh.
There was no no suggestion that the BBC would suffer equal prejudice
if the programme was delayed until after the elections although the
broadcast might lose some of its topicality.
Although the terms of Lord Abernethy's order applied only to Scotland,
the judge was informed that it might not be technically possible to
broadcast the flagship current affairs programme only south of the
Border.
After the decision, Mr James Taylor, solicitor-advocate, who appeared
for the BBC, asked the judge if he was prepared to restrict the ban to
Scottish transmitters.
He explained that some areas in the south of Scotland were served by
transmitters in the North of England and it might not be possible to
preserve the programme only for England and Wales.
The judge said, however, that he was not prepared to restrict the
terms of the interdict.
Earlier, Mr Andrew Hardie, QC, for Mr Chalmers and Mr Houston, asked
the judge to ban the BBC from broadcasting the Major interview until
after the polls closed in the local government elections on Thursday.
Mr Hardie argued that if the progamme were broadcast during the
election campaign without being balanced by interviews with politicians
of equal standing from other parties, the BBC was in breach of its
obligation to be fair.
He was not seeking an indefinite postponement of the broadcast, only a
delay until the polls closed. If the BBC gave an undertaking not to
broadcast the interview until then, Mr Chalmers and Mr Houston would
have no complaint.
Mr Hardie added: ''It is also important to bear in mind that the Prime
Minister was asked by the BBC for an interview as long ago as December
last year.
''It appears that repeated requests were made and these were denied.
It was only last week that the Prime Minister's office indicated a
willingness to agree to such an interview.
''One might then question the decision of his office to accede to an
interview at this particular point of time if it is not related to the
local government elections in Scotland, where, my lord will be aware,
some people are expressing concern about the fate of Conservative
candidates.
''It is inconceivable that the BBC would broadcast this programme in
England and Wales three days before local elections there. They seem to
have ignored or been unaware of the imminence of local elections in
Scotland.''
Mr Taylor told the court: ''The BBC does not come to this court and
seek to argue that it has a duty to be other than impartial.''
However, the test of impartiality was not that argued by Mr Hardie.
The BBC had to maintain a balance between the parties over the whole
period of the election campaign, which in this case was five weeks.
No-one had suggested that this duty had not been fulfilled.
He also warned against the assumption that the appearance of the Prime
Minister in Panorama would necessarily give rise to a sympathetic view
of the Conservative Party in the eyes of the electorate.

ONE Labour MP told another to stop whingeing, and the second one said
the first had been got at by the whips after they had both been sacked
by Labour leader Tony Blair. Their dismissal from the front bench is
expected to promote Mr George Foulkes, furthering his rehabilitation
from disgrace two years ago.
Mrs Ann Clwyd and Mr Jim Cousins -- who were members of the Shadow
Cabinet's Foreign Affairs team -- were carpeted by Mr Blair for missing
Commons votes while on an unauthorised trip to the war zones on the
Turkish-Iraq border. Welsh MP Mrs Clwyd claimed she had been unfairly
treated.
But Mr Cousins, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne, declared: ''I don't think
she has been unfairly treated. I don't think I've been unfairly treated.
I am not whingeing one iota and I strongly recommend that Ann doesn't
whinge either.'' He said he had no regrets about the dangerous trip.
A different picture was painted by Mrs Clywd. She described travelling
through an area where they were bombarded by Iraqi troops. ''I'm afraid
Mr Cousins was bleating and whimpering and I had to hold his hand.''
Mr Cousins had told the BBC that he only went on the trip to protect
her. Ms Clwyd said: ''The idea he went out to protect me is ludicrous.
He even came home 12 hours early having taken fright.''
A spokesman for Mr Blair explained: ''They have been dismissed for
going abroad without the permission of the Whips or of the Shadow
Foreign Secretary (Robin Cook) and subsequently failing to return for
important votes having been asked to do so.'' The Labour leader
reprimanded them individually.
But Mrs Clwyd -- who was sacked by Mr Kinnock when he was Labour
leader in 1988 for refusing to accept defence policy -- insisted that Mr
Blair had been bounced into the decision by Chief Whip Derek Foster. ''I
am quite prepared to take punishment when it is deserved, but I do not,
in the circumstances, believe it was deserved,'' she said.
The trip was undertaken at short notice, and the two MPs left messages
for Mr Cook and the Whips. It is claimed that once abroad, in rugged
country where the warlords rule, communications were difficult and
messages confused. They missed Foreign Office questions and divisions on
disabled rights' legislation.
''I note the voting on Monday, when quite a large number of Labour MPs
were absent in all three votes, also on Tuesday and Wednesday,'' said
Mrs Clwyd. She added that the invitation to make the trip had come from
the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, who asked her to act
as an observer because of her experience of the Kurdish problem.
''We made very strenuous efforts to get back on the Tuesday, which was
the first possible moment to get back'' but, Mrs Clwyd claimed, the vast
distances and transport problems defeated them.
Mr Foulkes is now expected to step into Mrs Clwyd's spot as Mr Cook's
No 2. Two years ago, after a Scotch Whisky Association party, Mr Foulkes
was arrested for a breach of the peace outside the House of Lords. Mr
Foulkes then resigned his Shadow defence portfolio and pled guilty.
