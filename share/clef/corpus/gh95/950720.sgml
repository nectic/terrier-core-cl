TAY House in Glasgow has broken into the private sector of the rental
market after signing up The Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The bank has taken the 20,000-sq-ft fifth floor of the building, which
stands prominently by the city's Bridge to Nowhere at Charing Cross.
Owners Svenska Handelsbanken will be pleased to have a prestigious
financial institution in the property, which currently houses two
Government departments. The last letting was to the Offshore Supplies
Office, which leased the whole top floor earlier this year.
Some 70,000-sq-ft remains available, which represents less than half
of the building. Tay House is the only development in Glasgow that can
provide large-scale floorplates of between 20,000 and 30,000 sq ft, for
immediate occupation.
The landlords were represented by joint agents Richard Ellis and
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Craig Ritchie, of Richard Ellis, said: ''This
letting falls in line with our instructions to seek good quality tenants
for the building at the earliest possible time. Strong interest is also
being received from other companies who require office space with
good-sized open plan floorplates.
''The recent letting activity at Tay House continues to put further
pressure on the availability of new office space in the city, and
tenants who require this type of office space are now being left with
very few property options.''
The Property department of the Royal Bank of Scotland plc were advised
by DTZ Debenham Thorpe.

THE trouble with putting your back into a project is that you often
end up with wracked muscles or torn ligaments . . . just like Jamie
Armstrong, the driving force behind City Story. In among the last-minute
pell-mell, he copped an injury that kept him from dancing on the night.
Even so, watching from the sidelines he must have felt fairly chuffed at
the outcome of four weeks' hectic effort that amalgamated the energies
of professional dancers, live musicians, and members of the community.
There's a deal of very effective choreography in City Story, alongside
some clever touches in the underlying structure and -- a key element in
the whole process -- a strong involvement of different age groups from
the wider dance community in the city.
On one level, the piece is an entertaining collage of dance trends
from the fifties to the present time. The opening strains of In The Mood
-- played live by the Carlton Big Swing Band -- brought couples swirling
on to the floor in an evocation of Glasgow's ballroom heyday. As the
music changed, so did the era and the dancing, with sequences of
everything from the jive to pogoing, from disco to break-dancing, all
carefully dressed in period togs.
But on another more meaningful level, there was The Jacket: an
unmissable item in red and yellow satin. Passing from wearer to wearer,
The Jacket pointed up the changing social attitudes echoed in the
changing forms of social dancing, and drew attention to the darker side,
the hazards of what is meant to be a form of fun.
By the time we reached the rave scene -- dozens of youngsters, all
moving like self-contained automata while bodies dropped, exhausted to
the floor -- there was a distinct sense of a society gone awry, a notion
confirmed by the futuristic vision of game-play where taking your
partner meant fighting in a bizarre, violent mockery of a dance.

THE number of Scots claiming unemployment benefit fell again last
month, and the rate in Scotland is now below that of the South-east of
England, according to Government figures released yesterday. In fact,
more than half the drop for the whole of the UK occurred in Scotland.
The June figures show a decrease in the seasonally adjusted total of
2700 to 197,600, or 7.9% of the Scottish workforce.
The overall UK figure fell 4200 to a four-year low of 2,313,200, or
8.3% of the workforce. It was the twenty-second consecutive monthly
reduction, but the fall was the lowest since January last year, and well
down on the average monthly decline of 27,700 over the past 12 months.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said: ''It is testimony to the
transformation of the Scottish economy that, in the unemployment figures
announced today, Scotland's rate is 0.4 percentage points below the UK.
It has now been below the UK rate for over three years and is even below
the (8%) rate in the South-east of England.
''Scotland led the UK out of recession and unemployment has now been
on a downward trend since December, 1992. Today's fall below 200,000 is
excellent news.''
However, Mr Forsyth added: ''Although unemployment has fallen below
8%, it is still too high. We must create more jobs and encourage more
investment in Scotland.''
For the Scottish Labour Party, assistant general secretary Tommy
Sheppard said: ''Unemployment remains at an unacceptably high level. It
is not only a cause of misery for 200,000 families in Scotland but it is
frustrating the entire quality of life in Scottish society.
''The decrease is a drop in the ocean. It is ridiculous that Michael
Forsyth's only comment on a terrible problem is that it is even worse
elsewhere.''
SNP employment spokesperson Anne McNair said the Government had
''fiddled'' the unemployment figures so many times that they had long
since ceased to be credible.
''About the only thing that can be read into these figures is that
Scotland is still a land of mass unemployment. By crowing that
unemployment is greater in other parts of the UK, Michael Forsyth
betrays an extraordinarily complacent and London-centric attitude, which
does nothing to address the misery of joblessness in Scotland.''
For the Scottish Liberal Democrats, parliamentary spokeswoman Mrs Ray
Michie said the marked slowdown in the UK rate of decline gave concern
for the future.
''For the 200,000 people still out of work in Scotland, the stalling
economy will provide no comfort. We are paying the price for the lack of
long-term investment, especially in skills and education.''
Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said
that, despite the further fall, the figures would send a shiver down the
spine of the thousands of youngsters leaving school and graduating from
college and university this month.
''The scale of Scotland's unemployment problem demands urgent action
by the new Secretary of State. Mass unemployment is the biggest blight
on the Scottish economy. That is why full employment will be at the top
of the STUC's agenda in any meeting we have with Mr Forsyth.''
Mr Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, said he was delighted that
there had been a further fall and that the Scottish rate remained below
the rest of the UK. However, he added: ''While the numbers are going in
the right direction, there is no cause for complacency. We need to get
still lower levels.''
Outside Scotland, unemployment increased in some regions including the
South-east, East Anglia, Wales and Yorkshire. However, dole queues
continued to shrink in London, the Midlands, Northern Ireland and
elsewhere.
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard said: ''Britain is
now in its fourth consecutive year of economic growth, inflation is
under control and the labour market is one of the most flexible in
Europe. As a result, Britain has fewer people on the unemployment
register and a higher proportion of its population in work than any
other major European country.''
However, Labour employment spokeswoman Harriet Harman said the figures
showed a ''marked slowdown'' in the fall in unemployment. ''This is a
worrying sign at a time when the recovery should be gaining ground. The
Government is not running the economy in a way that creates enough jobs
and cuts into the huge numbers still out of work.''

BELGIAN skipper Marc Degryse yesterday joined the FA Premiership's
foreign legion after signing a three-year deal with Sheffield Wednesday.
Degryse, signed for a fee thought to be at least #1.5m, was presented
at a news conference at Hillsborough along with Wednesday's #900,000
capture from Derby, Mark Pembridge.
The Belgian, who was on Celtic's wanted list, decided to follow other
European big names -- including Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp and Chelsea's
Ruud Gullit -- to England.

COLIN Jackson has climbed down in the face of an ultimatum from
Britain's athletics selectors, and has agreed to prove his fitness for
next month's World championships in Gothenburg.
But after the British Athletic Federation's executive chairman had
secured a change of heart from the world 110 metres hurdles record
holder yesterday, he declined to confirm whether or not the Welshman had
been reprimanded.
Jackson withdrew from last weekend's AAA championships, hurdled the
following day for a reputed $35,000 in Italy, then said he would not be
racing again before the championships -- a stand-off which threatened to
spike his world title defence.
The BAF supremo, professor Peter Radford, insisted there would be no
further elaboration on their conversation, but the matter seems far from
over. As predicted in these columns, the resignation of Dave Cropper,
the selection committee chairman, is being sought by the BAF treasurer
John Lister.
Steve Backley, European and Commonwealth javelin gold medalist, who
missed the trials with an Achilles problem, yesterday joined former
European 400m champion Roger Black in condemning the federation's
insistance that top athletes prove their fitness.
Sally Gunnell, who must show form against Scotland's Mel Neef at
Sheffield on Sunday, said: ''Too much is being said through the Press.
The sad thing is that all this negative stuff is bringing the sport down
and overshadowing some great performances.''
Supreme amongst those was the world triple jump record on Tuesday by
Jonathan Edwards who also opted out of the AAA event. Edwards knew
nothing of the fuss until he arrived home yesterday.
''I think maybe the selectors should perhaps have focussed in on Colin
Jackson, and on what he did, rather than spread it among other
athletes,'' he said.
Edwards, who reached 17.98 metres in Spain, believes he can go further
in Gothenburg. ''Technically, the record jump was not particularly
good.'' He was unconcerned at having to drop out, having landed heavily
on his left ankle in the fourth round. ''It feels fine,'' he reported.
''It's just a case of nursing it through.''
He confirmed he intends to compete in Sheffield, and possibly, with a
Ferrari Testarosa at stake for another record, in Italy the following
week.

GORDON Sherry currently inhabits one of those zones of the imagination
in which a golfer appears to be able to do no wrong. After having helped
Scotland to win the European Team Championship with the maximum of six
points Sherry then finished equal fourth in the Scottish Open.
Yesterday, in his final practice round, he had a hole-in-one.
It was the second such stroke of fortune for the Amateur champion and
it was achieved at the first of the Old Course's two short holes, the
178-yard eighth. Moreover, he was keeping ''fantastic'' company when his
No.7 iron shot fell in on the second bounce.
None other than Jack Nicklaus, winner of the title three times, and
Tom Watson, five times the champion, were on the tee along with Tom
Wargo, the American holder of the British senior title. ''We didn't
actually see the ball go in,'' Sherry said later, ''but we knew what had
happened when the crowd cheered.''
Nicklaus, always a hero of Sherry, who still watches videos of his
instructional series Golf My Way, took the opportunity to invite the
21-year-old Barassie golfer to his Memorial Tournament next year, if his
studies at Stirling University allow. He will have played in the Masters
only a few weeks before.
Sherry, who intends to complete his degree course before he
contemplates the possibility of a professional career, went home last
night to work out his game plan -- what clubs to take from the tee and
to think about the pin placements which he expects to be in tight
corners of the huge greens.

IF, it has been suggested, Cleopatra's nose had been longer -- or was
it shorter? -- the history of the world would have been substantially
rewritten. Whether or not another part of Greg Norman's anatomy will
have any effect on the destiny of the 124th Open Championship, which
begins at St Andrews today, is a supposition to be tested -- but, in
this instance, proved.
Yesterday, almost in a casual way, Norman disclosed he had a stiff and
sore lower back, the result, it seems, of being over-golfed and
over-travelled. Most recently he practised for up to five hours each day
during a holiday last week at Skibo Castle, near Dornoch.
Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Royal and Ancient Club, said that
Norman had told him he would hit shots on the practice ground before his
8.45am start. Norman added: ''I won't play if I have any doubt about
completing the round.'' An alternate, Newcastle's Michael Archer, is on
standby in case Norman withdraws.
The ailment was worrying enough to dissuade Norman from attending the
champions' dinner hosted by the R and A in their clubhouse on Tuesday.
His mane of blond hair was conspicuously missing from the group
photograph and some who attended thought he should have made the effort.
But his apology for absence was accepted and understood.
''The game of golf is not conducive to natural movement,'' Norman
explained. ''I have had this back problem since 1991, when I started my
serious workout programme. But every player has aches and pains in the
back, the neck, or the shoulders.'' Nothing more than an occupational
hazard, albeit a potentially damaging one.
Norman, therefore, will go into the first round having had only one
playing reconnaisance of the Old Course. He practised neither on Tuesday
nor yesterday, when instead he walked with Raymond Floyd, Michael
Campbell, and Nick Price. ''I do plan to play, but only time will
tell,'' said the world's No.1 ranked golfer.
This examination never changes, though, and what with previous Open
and Dunhill Cup appearances Norman has little to learn -- except that,
as the best players realise and accept, there is invariably something
these links keep up their voluminous sleeve to test the skill and guile
of those who would unravel its secrets.
On the available evidence, and keeping in mind that the leading 65 in
the current Sony world rankings and a record 80 of the first 100 are
competing, Norman would head any shortlist of overseas contenders. After
all, his last five finishes have been first, fourth, second, first and
eleventh and with $1.102m he is leader of the US Tour money earners.
It may be an admission of lack of original thinking, but the other
likeliest overseas candidates for the title would seem to be Corey
Pavin, who won the US Open Championship last month, and Price, the
holder, both of whom would defy history if they won, and Masters
champion Ben Crenshaw, still at 43 one of the great putters of his
generation.
Taking the same line of least resistance to the observable facts, the
safest pairs of hands to carry the European challenge must be thought as
belonging to Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer and Colin Montgomerie. Apart
from the last named all have known the cruel and unusual pressures
inextricably associated both with the climax, and the winning, of a
major.
Pride is the emotion which chiefly motivates those with championship,
as distinct from tournament, winners. But, Norman contended, nobody who
has not been there can know how difficult victory is to achieve. ''We
are not machines and we are going to make mistakes and have hiccups,''
he said. ''It takes so much to sustain a level of consistent play.''
Faldo is unashamedly proud of his achievements and anxious for more of
them. ''If you don't want something, you ain't gonna get it, it's as
simple as that,'' said Faldo, who then joked: ''I wanted to be my own
boss and lead an outdoor life -- and I've done both.'' He also carries
fond memories from five years ago.
Then Faldo as good as won the championship in the third round,
destroying Norman in front of the Australian's own eyes by 67 to 76.
Faldo played well enough at Augusta but without any putting success and
his short game betrayed him at Shinnecock Hills. ''But my game was
sharpened by being in at the death in the Scottish Open and it's now
where I want it to be.''
Montgomerie's highest finish in five Opens was eighth last year at
Turnberry, but he has been absent from the winner's rostrum for 11
months and although his consistency level has been phenomenal the iron
can enter the soul of a player for whom winning is not the most
important thing, but the only thing. Another test of Montgomerie's
temperament and character awaits.
In 17 Opens Langer has five times been in the first three, including
equal second at St Andrews 11 years ago. His two victories in three
weeks ahead of the US Open were, almost inevitably, too good to be good
for him and, after a week's rest, this most stolid and painstaking of
golfers should again be in a positive frame of mind.
Unrealistic would be the only word to attach to the prospects of
Severiano Ballesteros, Jose Maria Olazabal, Sandy Lyle, and Ian Woosnam.
Injuries to mind and body, and sometimes both together, must reduce them
to little more than ciphers in the equation formed by the field of 159,
the biggest in the championship's history. Pavin and Price would break a
mould long set if they were to match Tom Watson's achievement of 1982,
when he won the US Open and retained this title. Both certainly are in
form and have the ability to manoeuvre the ball if the elements turn
more hostile than yesterday's humid air stirred by a fitful south-west
wind.
For the weather could be the nub of this argument. The fairways are in
excellent condition and even with more grass on them than Norman has
ever seen before, underneath they have the firmness of a links. An
abundance of low scores would be no crime, but to be an Open
Championship test the 6933-yard course requires reinforcements to shore
up its defences against a total comparable to that of some backwoods
tournament.

SCOTLAND are on target to keep their grip on the Triple Crown after
defeating England Amateurs in yesterday's tournament opener in Belfast.
At one stage, George Salmond's men looked set to romp home in
double-quick time as they chased a modest target of 127.
But they became bogged down on the slow-paced pitch. And although the
eventual winning margin was a convincing six wickets, it took them 53
overs to get there.
The hero was Uddingston's George Reifer who displayed tremendous
patience for his 49.
Salmond's varied attack had bowled tightly with Greig Williamson, Ian
Stanger and Kevin Thomson each taking two wickets, although
man-of-the-match Reifer tied down the Englishmen, with one for 11 in 11
overs.
The Scots face Ireland today. A relieved Salmond said: ''It was hard
work, but we made it.''
England Amateurs 127 (M Roberts 32); Scotland 128-4 (G Reifer 49).
* SCOTLAND'S Under-19 lost their first match in the World Youth Cup
yesterday in Holland yesterday, then heard coach Jim Love say: ''That's
taught you an important lesson.''
The cricket kids breezed through their opening two games of the
tournament, only to meet their match against Denmark.
Denmark's total of 183 looked well within the Scots' reach when
openers Dougie Lockhart and Grieg Butchart put on 85 before Lockhart
fell for 47. When Butchart was out for 30, none of the other batsmen
managed to take control and they were all out for 165. Injured fast
bowler Steve Blackie will miss today's match against Canada.

STIRLING student Pauline McLean will be aiming to demonstrate the
benefits of two weeks' training in France when she lines up in today's
200 metres free-style at the British National Swimming Championships in
Coventry.
The 20-year-old is the only member of the Scottish team who has chosen
to sandwich the British event in between the training stint and the trip
to the Canadian National championships, which start in Winnipeg a week
today.
She could not have asked for a stiffer test than taking on defending
champion Karen Pickering, Alex Bennett and Claire Huddart. All three
English girls are in the British team that heads for the European
championships in Vienna next month.
Graeme Smith, the only Scot in the European side, had hoped to boost
his build-up by reclaiming the British 1500m free-style crown from Ian
Wilson. But following training early yesterday, the Stockport-based
19-year-old was laid low by a throat and chest infection and is almost
certain to withdraw from tomorrow's event.
If he does pull out, Fraser Walker will be left to carry Scotland's
medal prospects in the men's championship. He goes in the two medleys,
and will not lack incentive against City of Leeds rival David Warren.
Warren has replaced the Scottish Commonwealth Games medallist in the
British side for the European championships and, after several changes
of clubs and the snub of having been left out of Scotland's team for
Canada next week, a double victory would be the ideal morale-booster for
Walker.
The championships are the final selection event for the World Student
Games in Japan next month. The British team, which has Scottish pair
Graeme Goudie and Mike Peyrebrune as manager and coach respectively,
will be named next week.

THE Royal and Ancient will be keeping a close eye on the controversial
matter of pace of play over the next four days.
Players will be under the usual pressure this year to keep to the
required limits of 4hr 20min for a three-ball on the first two days, and
3-50 for a two-ball in the last two rounds.
They will be warned for taking too much time over a shot and penalised
two shots for a second offence. If they receive a third warning they
will be told that a fourth warning will bring disqualification.
''We think the times are very generous, but you have to take into
account that double fairways and double greens could slow people down,''
said R and A secretary Michael Bonallack.

JOEL Stransky, the man whose last-minute drop goal won the World Cup
for South Africa, and Springbok team-mate Chester Williams will not,
after all, be part of a showcase game at Scotstoun Showground later this
year.
Glasgow rugby officials have confirmed that the city's November 13
match against Western Province, the home of Stransky and Williams, and
arguably the strongest South African provincial team, has been
cancelled. Hamish Fyfe, the Glasgow convener, said: ''It is sad that we
have lost such a prestigious game. We are seeking a replacement match
for the same week.''
Mike Burton, the former English prop who was arranging the tour, has
written to Jim Telfer asking that Scotland's rugby authorities accept
Griqualand West as a replacement for Western Province, whose call-off
was prompted by their commitment to next year's Rupert Murdoch-backed
''Super Twelve'' competition in the southern hemisphere.
''Griqualand West are rising to the top in South African rugby and
have beaten Western Province, Natal, Western Transvaal, and Eastern
Province very recently,'' said Burton. ''Leinster, Ulster, and Munster
have all accepted the stand-in team and I hope that the Scots do, too.''
By way of compensation, The Herald understands that Australian winger
David Campese will play here against an emerging Scotland XV on Sunday,
February 11, as New South Wales prepare for the Super Twelve tournament.

LEE Trevino, the twice Open champion, is missing his faithful Scottish
caddie Willie Aitchison this week at St Andrews. Willie broke a leg in
an accident while caddying in Italy earlier this summer and was still
unfit for the Open.
In his place is Trevino's secretary's husband Mike Pierre, who soon
fell victim to yet another Trevino practical joke. Pierre, a marathon
runner who has done the New York event in 3hr 49min, was finding
Trevino's golf bag a bit heavier than a fighting fit fellow might expect
. . . until he looked inside and discovered several bricks.
* A CHIP off the old block is Daniel Trevino, aged two years and nine
months and already a master of the one-liner.
Having been settled on the loo, his father asked if everything was OK
and could he leave him to it?
Trevino Jr replied: ''Well, I could do with a magazine.''
* TREVINO Sr, 55 years young now, is bouncing back with typical verve
from a serious operation carried out last October to cure a chronic neck
complaint.
Surgeons literally cut his throat on one side to remove a ruptured
disc. Then some bone from part of his knee cap was inserted into his
neck and grafted on to the problem area with a titanium plate.
Trevino needed to wear a neck brace for seven weeks, but was playing
again by the start of the year.
* ONLY two left-handers adorn this year's Open field of 159 --
American hope Phil Mickelson and 1963 champion Bob Charles. But
spectators watching on the practice range yesterday could have been
forgiven for thinking a third corrie-fister had entered.
Closer scrutiny revealed that, in fact, it was big-hitting Vijay Singh
who was banging the ball away left-handed. The Fijian, who has suffered
from recent back problems, was carrying out a regular drill designed to
exercise different muscles in his torso.
* BOOKMAKERS reported a rush of support yesterday for Nick Faldo after
Greg Norman disclosed he has a bad back. Norman and Faldo were joint
favourites at 8-1 on Tuesday, but after large sums were wagered on Faldo
yesterday, the Briton was outright favourite at 7-1.
* BIG-hitting American John Daly, a reformed alcoholic, is now
suffering from migraines. ''I started getting real bad migraines at the
US Open,'' the 1991 US PGA champion said. ''They're still with me and
the doctor says they could be caused by stress. I'm hoping that's all it
is.''

SO Fergus McCann doesn't like what he has been reading in the papers.
Celtic's managing director feels there have been a number of stories
which have not done his club any good. What a shame.
McCann, so unhappy with the papers, has gone into print himself, using
the club's official newspaper to put the record straight on various
issues. Do yourself a favour, Fergus, and stop behaving like one of the
directors you bought out.
The siege mentality, a characteristic of Celtic of a former regime,
was supposed to have been swept away in the mood of change as the club
set about the enormous task of rebuilding team and stadium. Yet here is
McCann popping up from behind the parapet and throwing down scorn. Good
old Fergus, that's the way to beat Rangers and prevent them from
marching closer to nine in a row!
He wishes to deal in facts, which is fine by most of us, so let us
just examine one or two. Celtic supporters' money is helping to finance
the rebuilding of the stadium and these people want to see a decent team
playing inside the new structure.
So far, Celtic have not called a press conference to parade their new
signings and so far the ''lion's share'' of the money raised from
allowing the fans shares in their club has not been given to manager
Tommy Burns to buy players. McCann did say Burns would be given the
lion's share, didn't he? Or did I just read that in one of the
newspapers?
Celtic have looked at some quality players, but they haven't signed
one yet, and do not allow McCann to cloud this issue by claiming that
#4m has been spent on bringing ''the undoubted qualities of players such
as Phil O'Donnell, Tosh McKinlay, and Pierre van Hooydonk to Celtic
Park.'' Who says they are quality players? The jury is still out on
them, Fergus.
Besides, these players were purchased before the fans handed over
something like #14m for shares and therefore should not be included in
the ''lion's share.''
McCann also claims the faith of Celtic's fans has been restored, but I
do not think so. They were not fooled for long by a faltering Scottish
Cup success and they know better than most how far behind Rangers their
club have fallen.
It is probably closer to the truth to say that, given the difficulties
experienced in the recent past, the supporters are desperate to see a
return to better days and are willing to do what they can to see this
achieved. They are paying and praying.
What they would like is to see new players in their colours and in
this respect they continue to be disappointed. New grounds are all very
well and necessary, but a shiny stadium does not constitute success.
Major trophies do that, and these can be won regularly enough only by
fielding a top-class side. This is fact, not fiction.
So let us hear no more from McCann about the dastardly press or about
the ''right players for the club.'' Just get on with it and let's see
the manager sign a big-name player -- someone like Marc Degryse, who
pledged himself yesterday to Sheffield Wednesday, for instance.
The Belgian national team captain signed for an undisclosed fee,
although it is thought he cost #1.5m, but then again perhaps he wasn't
right for Celtic. It could also be that David Ginola did merely use
Celtic as a bargaining tool for more money, but players like the
Frenchman are few, and if Celtic wanted him they should have made
absolutely certain they would get him.
So far as the stories about the stadium being ready in time for the
show match against Newcastle United on August 5, we shall see.
Hopefully, all 34,000 seats will be taken as the team are welcomed home
again after a season at Hampden.
It will be a sight to behold for Celtic fans, but if they had the
choice, they would rather be celebrating the debut of a new star than a
new stand. So next time you peek over the parapet, Fergus, see what you
can do to help them on that one.
Oh, yes, and do stop bleating about the press. It reminds your own
supporters of dark, barren days.

THE feud which sees Hearts and their manager, Tommy McLean, locked in
combat will not be settled easily despite some claims that McLean was
ready to leave the club with a massive cash settlement.
The truth, of course, is different. There has been no huge offer to
McLean. He has been offered something in the order of #50,000 when he
still has a two-year contract worth almost four times that.
I know that Hearts' chairman Chris Robinson believes he is being fair
in what he has put on the table, but he shows little knowledge of what
the game is about.
Tommy McLean has a contract. He still has two years of that contract
to run and, obviously, he must look for a pay-off which reflects that.
The problem at Tynecastle is that the club do not have enough money to
pay him off, and then get on with the business of running what was once
a great football institution.
Yesterday, I understand, the chairman began to talk to out-of-contract
players, something which usually falls within the province of the
manager. He spoke to Neil Berry about a fresh deal and spoke to agent
Bill McMurdo about two of his clients, John Robertson and Scott Leitch.
Other talks were postponed, but these moves would suggest that
Robinson is ready to take over the running of the club even as McLean
considers an offer which I am told has been described by his advisers as
''peanuts.''
There is no doubt that McLean had offered to resign on several
occasions.
Once he did so when Hearts were ready to sell defender Alan McLaren
for just #750,000. He took a stand, won the day and the club eventually
received double that amount.
On another occasion, he opposed the sale of Tosh McKinlay to Celtic as
he tried to keep a team together.
The Hearts' directors may have misread his signals, just as they
misread the situation they inherited from the outgoing chief, Wallace
Mercer.
That, however, is not McLean's problem. He went to Hearts ready to do
a job, to rebuild the club just as he had done at Motherwell over the
years.
The problems which ensued were not of his making. Nor are the problems
which exist now.
Tommy McLean was promised a budget to strengthen his squad. That did
not appear. Instead, some of his major assets were sold, and he found
himself asked to make do and mend, hardly the scenario he had been
promised.
Now, as the boardroom battles continue, Hearts are foundering.
If Robinson wants to be rid of what he appears to see as his
''meddlesome'' manager, he will have to up the offer he has placed on
the table and match it with the one he made when his ambitions seemed
higher than they now appear to be.

I LIVED near the Dounreay atomic power station in Caithness from 1975
until 1992. For a number of these years I was the Scottish manager of an
agricultural land drainage company. Some of our work was done in the
fields around Dounreay, in the shadow of the now redundant ''dome of
discovery''.
My duties involved poking about in roadside ditches looking for old
drainage outfalls, and I quartered damp fields to plan new drainage
systems. The only element that concerned me was the weather. Caithness
is famous for fierce winds -- we put stones in our pockets from October
until May to keep us terra firma attached.
The chance of encountering less user-friendly elements, such as the
roadside nuclear ''hot spots'' recently discovered, did not occur to me.
Our atomic neighbour's safety record was second to none. At least, that
is what Dounreay spokespersons kept telling us. Accidents, when they
were reported, were minor incidents, never a hazard to human life or to
the environment, they said.
Doubts about Dounreay safety were difficult to address. Not only
because it was impossible to obtain accurate information, but also
because anyone questioning Dounreay safety exposed themselves to public
anger. ''The Atomics'', as Dounreay is known locally, was, and still is,
the major employer in Caithness.
Dounreay managers and scientists were an elite in our community and
they showed it by being dismissive of local, non-scientific opinion and
concern. They could do no wrong and any criticism was stifled by the
fact that every family in the country had someone, or knew someone, who
worked at Dounreay.
Now we have hard evidence of the real state of Dounreay safety, and
sad reading it makes; a litany of half truths and mismanagement
bordering upon a complete disregard for public safety. The full facts
about the explosion in the old disposal shaft will probably never be
known, but now, at least, the matter is being discussed.
Caithness leukemia clusters are also to be reinvestigated in the light
of evidence only now available. But the situation is confused because
some children left the country and their subsequent illness was
diagnosed elsewhere and may not have been considered in the light of
their Caithness origins.
But even during the Dounreay glory years, few locals frequented
beaches near the atomic power station, prompted, perhaps, by a sixth
sense of self-preservation, and there was always anecdotal evidence from
local fishermen of mutations among shell fish. We never ate Pentland
Firth fish products.
The turning point in public gullibility came in 1989 when the
government agency Nirex proposed to bury nuclear waste at Dounreay.
Local alarm bells rang, loudly, in spite of support for Nirex from the
late Lord Thurso, who, famously, declared he would be delighted to bury
nuclear waste in his backyard.
Supported by a publicity budget of #600,000, Nirex indulged itself, at
tax-payer expense, in public relations overkill. Its magazine,
Plaintalk, was delivered free to every Caithness household. The United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) converted a double-decker bus to
accommodate a Nirex exhibition which toured the country.
The ''Dounreay Battle Bus'', as it quickly became known, was painted
blue and white and had been converted to its new purpose at a cost of
#10,000. It was parked outside Presto's supermarket in Wick on Saturday
mornings and then moved to Thurso for afternoon sessions; dishing out
free sticks of Dounreay Rock to children and free tea, coffee, and
biscuits to adults.
Lead stories in Plaintalk featured glowing items such as: ''Disposal
strategy being fine-tuned''; there was a #25 prize competition designed
to ''test your Nirex known-how; and, gruesome in the light of the fact
that not all relevant evidence seems to have been made available to
those investigating Caithness leukemia clusters, ''Leukemia clusters --
New Towns to blame''.
The last straw was when referendum voting papers, issued by Caithness
District Council, arrived accompanied by a Nirex information sheet which
said: ''You may find the information in this note helpful to you in
deciding how to vote in the referendum.'' It was. Nirex was told that
neither it nor its nuclear dump was welcome in Caithness.
Now, if I read the runes right, Nirex could soon be back, knocking at
the Dounreay door, shovels and spades agape. If this is so, then it will
find a warm, well-organised welcome waiting. Spurious nonsense about the
life-threatening dangers of New Towns and free sticks of Dounreay Rock
will avail it nought.
The Dounreay nuclear safety myth has been ''blown'' and few people now
believe a single word Dounreay utters. Indeed, many local people believe
the sooner the whole industry is consigned to dust, the better it will
be for future generations. If they must dig a deep hole, some say, then
let them do so as speedily as possible, and use it to bury themselves.

GRAEME Obree failed to make it a hat trick of gold medals in the World
Cup track series, when he lost in the final in Tokyo to French rival
Philippe Ermenault.
The Scot qualified in 4min 40sec, conserving his energy for the final
after Ermenault had done 4.36. He then returned to his hotel nearby for
a rest, but it turned into a nightmare.
Obree explained: ''I had several hours before the final, so I thought
I would have a short nap. But I went out like a light and when I awoke
and returned to the track I found they had brought the race forward,
leaving me just five minutes to warm up.
''I went flat out, but my body was still asleep and I clocked 4.40
again. Earlier, I had been cruising when I did that time. It was a
strange feeling.'' Ermenault won in 4.38.

THREE Scottish surveying firms have won the contract to value an
estimated #3 billion public sector property portfolio. The consortium of
James Barr &amp; Son, F G Burnett, and Gerald Eve &amp; Co, has been instructed
to provide an Asset Valuation of the NHS estate in Scotland.
The Scottish Office appointment is the largest project of its kind in
Scotland, consisting of land and properties held by 46 National Health
Service trusts and 15 health boards.
Ken Barclay, managing director and project director, James Barr &amp; Son,
said: ''With over 120 years in the business, this is the largest and one
of the most exciting asset valuation projects James Barr &amp; Son has
undertaken. The consortium was a necessity to cater for the management,
logistics and geographical spread a project of this magnitude requires.
''I believe our success was based on our ability to demonstrate the
clearest understanding of the work, our genuine enthusiasm and our free
tender. This instruction highlights the opportunities which exist for
firms of like-minded approach and similar professional standards to join
together for specific valuation instructions.''
The asset valuation will include the inspection and valuation of 1700
NHS properties in Scotland as far afield as the Borders to Shetland, and
Aberdeen to the Western Isles. It is expected to take a team of 15
full-time staff four months of intensive work.
Alastair Gove, senior managing partner, F G Burnett, said: ''We are
very pleased to be involved in this opportunity to work with James Barr
and Gerald Eve in connection with this major valuation project. F G
Burnett will be undertaking the majority of work in Grampian, Highland
and the Western Isles and Angus.''
Michael Barclay, senior partner, Gerald Eve &amp; Co., said: ''This is a
very important piece of business for each of the three companies
involved and I'm looking forward to working with the partners from both
James Barr &amp; Son and F G Burnett.''
Previously, asset valuation of NHS property in Scotland was carried
out by district valuers every three years. The valuation office is
currently carrying out a similar exercise in England. The next asset
valuation in Scotland is unlikely to be carried out for another five
years.

* BRIAN Reid, the forgotten man at Ibrox, could emerge from his
self-imposed shadows in Denmark over the next week.
The 25-year-old defender was included in the squad of players who will
play on Rangers' pre-season trip, just as he has been included in the
three closed doors' games they have played so far in Scotland.
The former Morton player was the last signing made by Graeme Souness
before he left for Liverpool. He was injured very early after his
#300,000 signing and spent months sidelined.
Then, after he began his recovery, he asked the club for a transfer
and since that time he has remained available but has not attracted
serious offers.
Now he is being given the opportunity to resurrect his career.
Manager Walter Smith made that clear yesterday when he said: ''Brian
has been playing in the games we have had so far, and now he has a
chance to show us what he can do.
''The situation with Brian was simple. He saw too many other players
ahead of him for the central defensive roles. We had John Brown and
Basile Boli, for example, and he did not see a way ahead for himself at
the club.
''But things change and he is back in, and while he is still on a
month-to-month deal, that won't make any difference to him playing for
us.''
Reid was the one surprise choice in the Ibrox squad which is:
Andy Goram, Colin Scott, Billy Thomson; Stephen Wright, David
Robertson, Craig Moore, Alex Cleland, Alan McLaren, Richard Gough, Brian
Reid; Ian Ferguson, Paul Gascoigne, Ian Durrant, Trevor Steven, Alexei
Mikhailichenko, Stuart McCall, Brian Laudrup, Mark Hateley, Charlie
Miller and Gordon Durie.
Smith said: ''We have a team in mind for our European Cup game and
what we have to do in Denmark is put the finishing touches to that team.
We know the tactics we will favour, and we know the personnel we want to
use, but this is the time to put everything into operation.
''That is why there won't be too many changes taking place in the
three games we have before our tournament. Of course, we will not have
Ally McCoist, and that is a problem, but by the time we play in our own
tournament, we hope he will be fine.''
McCoist is one of three injury absentees from the squad which flies
out this morning. The others are Basile Boli and Gary Bollan.
Celtic also leave Glasgow this morning for a four-game tour of
Germany. They will be without captain Paul McStay, who had a close
season operation and now finds the wound still troubling him.
Explained manager Tommy Burns: ''Paul has an infection in the wound,
and he has had to rest for a couple of days. We will leave him at home
to continue his recovery. He'll be fine after a couple of days.''
The full Celtic squad for the Germany visit is:
Pat Bonner, Gordon Marshall; Tom Boyd, Tony Mowbray, Mark McNally,
Malcolm MacKay, Tosh McKinlay, Stuart Gray; Peter Grant, John Collins,
Phil O'Donnell, Brian McLaughlin, Pierre van Hooydonk, Andy Walker,
Willie Falconer, Simon Donnelly, Lee Martin, Rudi Vata.

ANY player with five Opens to his credit is entitled to say his piece
about the Old Course and the championship in general, but Tom Watson,
who has achieved that remarkable feat, does so with the same
self-effacing gentleness that was evident when he first lifted the old
claret jug back in 1975, writes Ian Paul.
Victories in any tournament have been hard to find for the Kansas man
in recent times. In fact, he has not been a winner for eight years and
describes himself as ''a professional golfer trying to win again.''
The odds are long against that famine being ended this week, but the
45-year-old is capable of doing well. With age, like all the great
players, Watson has found that maintaining the putting standard needed
over four rounds has been very difficult. However, he is playing well
and said that his putting stroke is good. ''The greens are slow and I
think that will help me a lot.''
He and Arnold Palmer beat Jack Nicklaus and Raymond Floyd in a
fourball on Tuesday for which he won #10. ''It was good to beat the
young guys. Our combined average age is 55, theirs 53 and a half.'' He
had wanted to play with Palmer at his last Open, although he is not
convinced this will be the last for the doyen of the US stars. ''He
loves the game with a passion, which is why I love him. He has been the
greatest promoter of the game.''
Watson is another in a long line of Americans who disliked the Old
Course when he first played it in 1978, even if he came close to
winning. ''It required too many shots to go along the ground. But in
1979 at Lytham I really discovered the truth about links golf. You need
to be able to play both aerial golf and along the ground. Once I told
myself that I changed to love these courses.''
Another of the old gunslingers in the Auld Grey Toon this week, Jack
Nicklaus, was in buoyant mood as he discussed the tournament, his
chances, and the course. Nicklaus, winner twice at St Andrews, has not
won on the US Tour since he startled the game's aficionados by taking
his sixth Masters title at the age of 46 in 1986, but there always lurks
the suspicion that he might just get it right one more time.
He might put up a decent show, if his assessment of his own form is to
be accepted, and it is usually pretty reliable. He has had two
successive second place finishes in the US Senior Tour and reckons last
week, when he was eventually beaten in a play-off by J C Snead, he
played his best golf for several years.
''I have been working on my game and the pieces are beginning to come
together. Realistically, I have always felt Augusta would be my best
chance for winning again because length doesn't count as much there. But
the same applies to St Andrews. I am not as long as I used to be, but
the extra experience and local knowledge I have should help.''

LAST night's debate on the recommendations of the Nolan Committee has
not brought an end to the Government's sufferings on the related matters
of sleaze and public unhappiness with the status and conduct of MPs. It
was not a cut and dried affair, but even if it had been, Parliament is
destined to return to the findings of the Scott investigation and the
way in which these are bound to cover fairly familiar ground from which
the Government cannot be expected to prosper. To an extent which now
looks remarkable, this sort of material has crowded many other
considerations out of the public mind. The undeniable improvement in the
country's economic prospects has left opinion unmoved. There are many
explanations for that, but the salient political fact lies not in these
but in the sentiment itself: people do not trust the economic and
financial evidence, and will not spend freely until they do. The
Government is depending on this pattern changing -- and it may yet do so
-- but even if it does there may be no accompanying change in political
attitudes. It looks as if many commentators have been too cynical about
political motivation, ascribing it willy-nilly to material facts and
calculations. It seems instead there is a purely political element,
rather than an overwhelming economic force, in popular assessments of
the political scene. And indeed some analysts of opinion trends and
voting outcomes have been able to show that this purely political,
rather than economic, element has sometimes been decisive in determining
electoral outcomes since Mr Callaghan's time. Indeed, he himself may
have been one of the first to recognise this phenomenon, when he
identified what he called a sea change in public opinion before the 1979
election which ended his Premiership.
One area of change has been in the Conservatives' reputation for
managerial competence, particularly in economic and financial affairs.
That was so dented by our ejection from the ERM that it has never
recovered, although Mr Clarke has turned out to be a far better
Chancellor, and certainly a more prudent one, than most were entitled to
expect. In part here the experience of home owners has told against the
Government, but even success has conferred few benefits. The battle
against inflation, a success so far, has had the effect of reducing the
income from savings, especially in the case of building society accounts
so important to middle-class people in the south of England. That change
is not as bad as it seems, since the low returns are at least real, but
the psychological effect has been severe and to the Government's
disadvantage, something compounded by its own-goals in the case of VAT
on domestic fuel and the ill-timed assaults on mortgage tax relief. The
feeling that the Conservatives are incompetent is reinforced by the huge
public borrowings and the way in which they are at present defying
reduction. It is also reinforced by the way in which sleaze -- a vague
word for a vague but unmistakable unpleasantness -- has questioned the
integrity of some Conservative MPs. To the extent that the attempt to
tar Labour local authorities with the same brush represents a Government
strategy to share the taint of sleaze with Labour, it is doomed to
failure. The likes of Monklands council is far from the First Eleven of
the House of Commons.
There have been achievements to the Government's credit but they
remain frustratingly unresolved. Mr Major has kept us out of war in
Bosnia -- so far. The threat of further entanglement remains real and
acute worries about the agonies of suffering Yugoslavs must persist. On
Ireland he has wrought wonders but the so-called Peace Process is still
very fragile and far from a firm conclusion, although the longer it goes
on the harder it will be for the IRA to abandon it for a return to
terrorism. As for his own standing in his party -- and with popular
sentiment as measured by the polls -- the Prime Minister took a brave
gamble and won it, if less convincingly than has been claimed. Yet Tory
divisions survive and no callous can disguise the scar that is Europe,
which is bound to open up again as the inter-governmental conference
approaches. This is a Government still waiting on events and not capable
of reacting to them with conviction, never mind anticipating or
orchestrating them favourably.

IT was only an exit line to the media gang, but it left us dumbstruck.
After assuring us that this, indeed, would be his last Open, Arnold
Palmer's parting shot, delivered in that slow Pennsylvanian drawl which
has become so familiar over the years, was thus: ''The only way I will
come back to play in the Open again is to defend the title.''
At 65, not having won the championship since 1962, when Nick Faldo was
starting primary school, Arnold may have as much chance of winning as
Lilli Palmer, but that remark gives a wonderful insight into the
consuming competitiveness of the man.
It was said with a smile, but he does still believe. Therein may lie
one of the secrets behind his remarkable durability as perhaps the most
admired sportsman in the world.
Arnie is all things to all men and women. He set off on his practice
round yesterday with a mini-army watching and wondering. The swing was
not quite as ferocious as in the old days, but he still came endearingly
close to strangling himself at its finish. Nostalgia is an ungainly,
murderous Arnold Palmer swing.
He reminisced about the first time he came to the Open, at the Old
Course in 1960, but also revealed that he had wanted to come as an
amateur in 1954. ''I had won the US Amateur title and I liked the idea
of tackling the Bobby Jones Grand Slam. I wanted to come, but these
ideas are all fine if you have the money. I was broke, literally broke.
I couldn't afford to come over.''
It was still very much his intention to try for the professional Grand
Slam and in 1960, when he won the US Masters and US Open, he saw his
chance to go for the four titles that make up the Slam. He didn't
succeed, but he didn't do too badly, finishing second to Kel Nagle.
''I have always felt that, if the last round hadn't been postponed
until the Saturday because of rain, I would have won.'' He did win a
year later and again the following year, victories that set the pattern
which other Americans followed and thus resuscitated the Open, which had
been in danger of losing its prominence on the golf stage.
''It doesn't seem like 35 years since I first came here,'' he said.
Talking of the championship he calls the ''most revered'' in the
world, he emphasised the need for the next generations to maintain the
standards of the Open and the game in general.
''We have a responsibility to protect the traditions and quality of
the game. When I came here in 1960 I felt those pressures and I feel no
different now. No career is fulfilled if you don't take part in the
Open. If you are fortunate enough to win you are recognised all over the
world. St Andrews brings all of this back to me.''
When Arnold rolls back the years he keeps his audience, even one
peppered with old cynics, enthralled. His tale of the 1964 Open at the
Old Course is one example, yet he was not even there.
''I was feeling kinda tired after a lot of hard work and decided I was
not going to the Open. I had told a young flamboyant player called Tony
Lema he should go to St Andrews. He agreed to go, but he asked me if I
would give him my putter. He won the Open with it.''
Palmer is genuinely upset that his Scottish caddie of 35 years, Tip
Anderson, won't be with him this week for his finale. Tip took ill
during the practice round on Tuesday and is not well enough to carry the
bag.
When will he pack in altogether? ''I will quit when I stop enjoying my
golf. At the moment I thoroughly enjoy it. Playing on the course is my
private time in a sense. I am still competitive, even if I am playing
myself. I sometimes wish I could impart those feelings to some of the
other golfers. It bothers me that they don't understand golf, what it
is, its traditions.''
Asked what his target this week is, he replied: ''There can be only
one. Just because I am 65 doesn't mean I will stop setting the same
target.''
It may be a glorious fantasy nowadays, but he won't be the only one
cherishing the possibility.

DESPITE recent Scottish Office planning guidelines which aim to
curtail out-of-town development, a 120,000-sq-ft retail park on the
south-east of Edinburgh has been given consent.
The scheme will be built next to the Kinnaird Park retail and leisure
development. The developers, Edinburgh Development and Investment (EDI)
and Glassedin, will be putting detailed plans to the district council
within the next few weeks. Preparatory work is already taking place on
site.
Bill Ross, chief executive of EDI, said: I expect strong demand and
anticipate the units will be available by the end of next summer.''
Harvey Spack Field and Mason Owen have been appointed joint letting
agents.

AUSTRALIAN Steve Elkington has his sights set on picking up the famous
claret jug at the home of golf this week, but he took time off from Open
practice at St Andrews to collect another prized award -- life
membership of Pumpherston Golf Club.
The multi-million dollar earner on the US PGA Tour helped the tiny
club, set among the shale bings of West Lothian, celebrate its
centenary.
He went round the nine-hole course in 31, two under par, in an
exhibition game with club champion Paul Drake, who shot 38.
The big Australian did the honours for the club because his caddie,
David Renwick, was a boy member there. Elkington, who can command
thousands of dollars appearance money, turned out for a club sweater and
malt whisky to take back to his home in Houston, Texas.
He beamed: ''Life membership of Pumphserton is a great honour. If I
win the Open I'm bringing the old claret jug straight down to show the
boys at Pumphie.''

THE Tour de France turned into a mourning procession for Olympic
champion Fabio Casartelli yesterday, opening with a minute's silence for
the dead Italian and ending with a symbolic win for his Motorola team.
0 The 119 riders tacitly agreed a pact out of respect for Casartelli,
who died in a crash on Tuesday. As the entire peloton rode into Pau at
the end of the 148-mile stage, riders slowed up to allow the six other
members of the American Motorola team to move ahead.
When Motorola rider Stephen Swart had a puncture, the bunch slowed up
to let him to drop back for repairs and move in front again. The six
team-mates rode abreast to the finish, five of them easing up to give
Casartelli's compatriot and room-mate Andrea Peron the honour of the
stage win.
It matched the gesture made after the Tour's last rider fatality in
1967, when Tommy Simpson died of heat exhaustion on Mont Ventoux. The
next day, his team-mate and fellow Briton, Barry Hoban, was allowed to
ride ahead to be given the stage win.
Yesterday's stage started with the Motorola riders -- wearing black
ribbons, as did the team cars -- lining up at the front for a minute's
silence.
Riders had agreed that all #30,000 of stage prize-money would go to
Casartelli's widow, and Tour organisers said they would match that sum.
Motorola said that the team's prize-money from the entire Tour would go
to his family.
Despite a latent controversy about the wearing of safety helmets --
Casartelli was not wearing one when he fell on a downhill stretch and
fractured his skull -- few riders chose to wear crash hats on a
searingly hot day. Tour doctors said on Tuesday that a helmet would not
have protected Casartelli.
His body was flown to Italy yesterday and his funeral will be held
today in his home village of Albese, near Como.
Tour organisers said there would be no official results for
yesterday's stage. The race continues with a flat, 153-mile stage to
Bordeaux today. Spaniard Miguel Indurain, seeking a fifth successive
win, retains the leader's yellow jersey with just four stages to go
before Sunday's finish in Paris.

DAVIS Cup pals Tim Henman and Mark Petchey gave the home crowd plenty
to cheer once more, taking the number of British survivors in the
Manchester Challenger to seven.
After helping David Lloyd's team crush Monaco 5-0, the duo found their
first-round opponents in the #32,000 event much more competitive.
Henman cruised through the second set 6-1 against French left-hander
Stephane Simian, but the opening set could have gone either way before
Henman prevailed 6-4.
Petchey needed to work even harder to reach the last 16 against
Surrey's Danny Sapsford. He dropped the opening set before bouncing back
to claim the next two by the same 6-3 margin.
Andrew Foster beat fellow Brit Paul Hand 6-4, 6-4.
* KENNY Wood moved into the final of the men's singles at the Scottish
Grass-court championships at the Dyvours Club in Edinburgh last night
with a 6-3, 7-6 win over No.3 seed Ian MacAulay.
In the final, the holder will meet Calum McKnight, seeded only sixth
in the event, who disposed of Toby Smith 6-2, 6-1.
Heather Lockhart kept on course to retain the women's title with a
6-0, 6-1 win over Abercorn's Camilla Mochrie in the semi-finals. No.2
seed Fiona Reid, however, lost to Nicola Burns 6-0, 6-3.

DEAN Richards, England's longest-serving forward, admitted that the
cash sums floated by Australian media magnate Kerry Packer's proposed
professional circus would make all rugby players take notice.
Leading players from England, Scotland, and Wales are on Packer's
shopping list as he attempts create a worldwide professional rugby
circus in opposition to arch rival Rupert Murdoch.
Packer's plans involve a World Rugby championship comprising eight
nations, 30 teams in all, and 900 players.
It is hoped that #66m will be raised, which would mean #73,000 per
player if it were equally split, though the top grade Test stars would
expect #130,000 with the lower-ranked players receiving about a quarter
of that.
Richards said: ''The sums we are talking about mean that you would
have to think about your future.''
Rugby Union president Bill Bishop, who took office last weekend, said:
''Any player signing for this circus would abdicate all rights within
rugby union.''

RAY Cochrane joined the growing list of riders who will miss all or
part of Glorious Goodwood next week when he was banned yesterday for
seven days.
He became the latest victim of the Jockey Club's clampdown on riders
who break the rules, after having committed his third riding offence of
the season.
Like Pat Eddery, Cochrane will miss the entire five-day meeting after
he was suspended from Saturday, July 22, until July 29 inclusive, for
careless riding at Sandown on July 7.
Cochrane's only firm booking had been for Elfland in the Stewards'
Cup. He now joins such as Eddery, Michael Kinane -- although he may
appeal against his whip ban -- George Duffield, and David Harrison in
being forced to miss some valuable races. A total of 11 banned riders
will be unable to ride on the opening day of Goodwood.

<HEADLINE>Chancellor and Governor still at odds.  Latest economic data confirms slowdown</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, yesterday seized on
the latest set of statistics, which suggest that the economy has slowed
down to around its trend rate of growth, to assert that he, and, by
implication, not the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, was
right on interest rates.
Yesterday's data were a mixed bag. Seasonally-adjusted unemployment
fell by just 4200 in June, its smallest monthly decline since January
1994. Average earnings growth edged up from 3.5% to 3.75%, and retail
sales were disappointingly flat last month.
The minutes of the June 7 meeting between the Mr Clarke and Mr George
showed that the two men were still at odds on rates. The Governor
pressed the case for an increase for the second month in a row, but was
again rebuffed by the Chancellor, who argued that the case against
raising rates had if anything strengthened slightly.
There was no change in rates after the July meeting. The August
meeting, which has been brought forward to next week, will find Mr
Clarke in an even stronger position to stay his hand on rates.
Unless there are signs that growth has started to pick up again over
the next two or three months, rates could be on hold until much later in
the year when a rise might be needed, in either November or December, to
offset expected tax cuts in the Budget.
If the economy fails to perk up again it is possible that rates may
have peaked though this would be at a much lower level than in the US or
in previous economic cycles.
Scotland gains
UNEMPLOYMENT fell by much less than the City expected.
James Capel's Adam Cole said that the figures suggested that the
economy had returned to its long-term trend rate of growth of around
2.25% per annum for the first time for two years.
Confirmation of this could be forthcoming tomorrow when second-quarter
gross domestic product figures are published. Growth is expected to fall
back from 0.7% in the first quarter to 0.5%.
More than half of the decline last month occurred in Scotland, where
the unemployment rate of 7.9% is now lower than in the south-east of
England, one of a number of regions where the numbers unemployed edged
up. Only three regions of England have lower unemployment than Scotland
-- East Anglia 6.4%, the South-west 7.3%, and the East Midlands 7.6%.
The UK average is 8.3%.
This represents a remarkable transformation of Scotland's relative
position during the nineties, albeit in the main because of
deterioration elsewhere in the UK.
In the latest three months UK unemployment has fallen by an average of
11,200, its lowest rate since September 1993. In the final quarter of
last year it was falling at an average of 47,900 a month.
Earnings rising
AVERAGE earnings have been posting historic lows of 3.5%, largely
because the exceptionally large bonuses paid to the financial sector in
the first quarter of last year were not repeated. That effect has now
worked its way out of the figures.
The April figure has been revised up to 3.75%, the same rate as that
posted for May.
Rising basic pay settlements, especially in manufacturing, will
increasingly dominate movements in average earnings. A further marked
acceleration in earnings growth throughout the remainder of the year can
be expected.
This will add to Bank of England worries about inflation and keep
alive the debate about interest rates. It should also provide a
launching pad for a recovery in consumer spending.
The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street will also be concerned about the
deteriorating trend in manufacturing unit labour costs which could
exacerbate factory gate price inflation.
The official figures show that these costs were sporting a
year-on-year rise of 3% in May, up from 2.4% in April. The latest figure
was hit by a decline in productivity growth to 1.4% in the year to May,
but Adam Cole makes the point that manufacturing output is probably
stronger than the official figures suggest. If this is so then unit
labour costs are being overstated.
Sales conundrum
CITY hopes of an increase of 0.4% in retail sales in June were not
validated. The only consolation was May's rise was revised upwards from
0.2% to 0.3%.
Volumes in May and June were the same as those achieved in December
and February. The recent trend has been lacklustre and the monthly
figures volatile.
However, there is some evidence that better times are returning to the
High Streets. Sales volumes rose by just 0.2% in the final quarter of
last year, and then fell by the same amount in the first quarter of this
year.
In the latest quarter sales have risen by 0.4%, the best performance
since the third quarter of last year. However, against the same three
months last year growth is only 1.1%.
Clothing and footwear sales rose strongly -- up 0.9% on the quarter
and 3.4% against the same three months of last year. Comparable figures
for food were 0.8% and 2.8% respectively and for mixed retail businesses
0.5% and 2%.
Household goods sales fell by 0.9% on the quarter and 0.4% on the same
quarter a year ago. Other non-food retailers sported comparable declines
of 0.2% and 3.6% respectively.
The weakness of the housing market is hitting the household goods
sector, and the small shops lumped together under the umbrella of other
non-food retailers are losing market share and suffering from the
National Lottery.
Lottery takings in June were the equivalent of 3.6% of retail sales.
Its effect on sales volumes is difficult to assess, but the latest
figures may suggest that it is wearing off.
The strength of the consumer in the second half of the year will be
the main determinant of whether the slowdown in growth is a pause for
breath or a peak in the economic cycle. Capel economists, among others,
are betting on the former. So too is the Chancellor.

IN reply to Carole McLean-Smith, may I say that at no time I said that
God is love is other than universal and that He loves only those who
believe in Jesus.
My point was that the expression of God's universal love is the gift
of his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ: so that all might believe in him.
What for many people is the greatest verse in the Bible (John 3:16)
sums it up: ''For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son
so that everyone who believes in Him should not die but have eternal
life.''
There you have it -- the universal love and the call for faith.
With regard to the phrase ''the best of our ability,'' I again make
reference to Paul's words (Galatians 5:16-26.) He wrote as follows:
''What human nature does is quite plain. It shows itself in immoral,
filthy and indecent actions; in worship of idols and witchcraft. People
become enemies and they fight. They separate into parties and groups,
they are envious, get drunk, have orgies and do other things like
these.''
What an accurate description that is of life today!

THE behind-the-scenes boardroom battle for top office in Scottish
Milk, the farmers' co-operative, took yesterday's meeting in Glasgow by
surprise.
Most of the dairy farmers who turned up at this first general meeting
of the eight-month-old successor to the Scottish Milk Marketing Board
were there to say farewell to Andrew Howie who has been closely involved
in the milk industry and its politics for 15 years.
They had appreciated the work he had put into steering the industry
from having enjoyed the benefits of statutory marketing controls under
the protective umbrella of the Scottish Milk Marketing Board into the
uncharted waters of operating their own co-operative.
Following deregulation of the milk industry some 80% former members of
the Scottish Milk Marketing Board, plus 167 applicants from Cumbria,
gave the new Scottish Milk a viable organisation to look after the
interests of its members and to achieve the best possible price for
their milk on the new ''open'' market.
The closure of the Galloway Creamery and its subsequent re-opening
under new management were problems Mr Howie had tackled.
From the start of Scottish Milk he saw efforts by a number of milk
processors to get members to trade with them directly but Mr Howie
believed that the co-operative was an essential strength in the market.
He said: ''It is to the credit of dairy farmers that the vast majority
have risen above the uncertainties and stayed with their co-operative.
It provides the best long-term insurance against risk and uncertainty.
''During the last eight months we have demonstrated to our members
that it is they who have the ultimate control of this organisation.''
And it was producer control that threw the meeting into confusion. All
had expected that following his speech and ending his term of office as
chairman there would follow a fairly formal election of his deputy
chairman Jim Brown.
But while Mr Brown sat at the top table Scottish Milk executive Jack
Pirie rose to read a statement from Mr Brown which said: ''The time has
come for me to say goodbye. As of today I am resigning from Scottish
Milk. The knives of the past week can now be withdrawn from my back and
I shall feel a little more comfortable.
''I have enjoyed my 13 years at SMMB, ten of which we paid the highest
milk price in the UK. I would like to sincerely thank the milk producers
who have supported me and also the excellent staff at Underwood Road
(the SMMB/Scottish Milk base).
''My reason for resignation is that I find myself in an untenable
situation as the result of actions of some of my fellow directors.''
He later explained that he had campaigned for support to take over as
chairman and had contacted, and gained support from all ''but had not
spoken to a lady from Argyll''.
He had discussions with Ayrshire farmer John Duncan, a board member
for two years, with a view to his becoming his deputy if elected and
understood that Mr Duncan agreed.
However, in the last few days, he was told by Mr Duncan that he would
be standing against him and that he had gained voting support.
Mr Brown said that latterly he had only the support of one farmer
member. ''It was an untenable position. I did not need the hassle of
trying to work with people I cannot rely on.''
He said he heard criticism that he was too close to Scottish Pride, a
major customer of Scottish Milk, manufacturing cheese and butter, and of
which his brother is a director.
He said that was nonsense. Scottish Pride as a customer had to be
negotiated with.
''I hope my resignation will not lead to further splits in the ranks
and members not giving their support to Scottish Milk.''
John Duncan, a 52-year-old dairy farmer with units at Maybole, is a
former member of the Scottish Farmers' Union livestock committee.
He said his appointment marked the change of mood with the move from
the statutory board to the co-operative and that it was ''producer
power'' that was exercised at the meeting.
Scottish Milk has a board of nine directors compared to the ten which
ran the SMMB. Yesterday's meeting approved a 3% increase in directors'
remuneration to a total of #89,880.
It has 1898 dairy farmer members plus 160 non-producing quota holders
registered.
Mr Brown said he would now concentrate on the family farm business
which runs 150 cows on 260 acres and it is intended to raise milk
production from 800,000 litres a year to one million litres.
Mrs Evelyn Mundell, who runs a 95-cow herd at Whitehouse, Kintyre,
Argyll, said of her appointment as deputy chairman: ''I am very happy
and will do the utmost for producers with Scottish Milk. If Scottish
Milk were not there it would be hard time for the industry.''

I WAS saddened to read Lawrence Bell's letter (Clergy selection, July
15). Mr Bell evidently does not understand that, in the days of linked
charges, church closures, and an increase in the number of
non-stipendiary clergy, the full-time professional minister's job is far
from secure.
Were he a minister in the Scottish Episcopal Church (Church of
Scotland clergy fare little better) his stipend currently would be
#13,000 per annum from which he would be expected to save enough to
purchase a house on retiral.
If he is married he would be heavily dependent on financial support
from his wife and children. His large manse or rectory may be in a poor
state of repair, cold and damp, and he might not be able to afford to
heat it properly. This is not a comfortable situation.
Perhaps the question should not be ''is the laity being well
served?'', but ''is the laity serving well?''
How can the clergy be expected to be ''high performing'' when their
conditions of service are so poor?
Should not everyone live on #13,000 per annum and give the surplus to
the poor?

RICHARD Muckart has joined Dunedin Fund Managers as investment
director from Ivory &amp; Sime, replacing Gordon Anderson, who has departed
abruptly.
''He has left the company. I don't want to say any more,'' said
Dunedin deputy chief executive Alan Kemp.
Mr Muckart, 44, was a rising star at Ivory &amp; Sime, where he was put in
charge of its flagship British Assets Trust last autumn to revive the
fortunes of the #600m operation.
Now he takes over responsibility for the investment of Dunedin's
entire #5400m fund management portfolio.
''He was a respected manager and we are sorry to lose him,'' said
Ivory &amp; Sime managing director Colin Hook.
Mr Muckart's immediate replacement at Ivory &amp; Sime is John Stubbs, who
joined the Edinburgh firm as chief investment officer in May after a
serving as number two at Postel, the Post Office pension fund.
Colleagues in the Scottish fund management business expressed surprise
at Mr Anderson's sudden departure from Dunedin, where he had worked for
10 years.
''He left rather abruptly. I don't know whether there are any problems
in that company,'' said the director of another fund management firm in
Edinburgh.

Sam Neill has not yet reached superstar status in the movie world,
but, as William Russell explains, it has not stopped the many and varied
film offers rolling in each year
SAM Neill grew up in New Zealand, but he was born in Northern Ireland
and has a British passport. He is also an international film star,
although -- in spite having appeared in the likes of Jurassic Park and
The Piano and co-starred with Meryl Streep -- not quite in the superstar
league. On the other hand the work he does is enviably varied.
This year alone, for instance, he has starred as the victim in John
Carpenter's horror film, In The Mouth of Madness, , followed by
Restoration, in which he plays Charles II, Victory, based on the Conrad
novel, and Country Life, an Australian version of Uncle Vanya directed
by Michael Blakemore. Neill plays Vanya.
He also featured alongside Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald as the
eccentric painter Norman Lindsay in Sirens, in which he collected a
stable of stunning subjects, including supermodel Elle Macpherson. It is
not the kind of variety one would get if one were a superstar. The image
would not allow it.
''My primary interest is doing films that appeal to me, and I try to
do as many different kinds of films as I possibly can,'' he said. ''I
try to balance things from time to time by doing things that are more
commercial.''
He did the Carpenter film because the director is a friend.
''To my surprise, when I read it, I enjoyed it immensely,'' he said.
''The two-line synopsis John had given me was not very encouraging -- he
had talked about a novelist who wrote books that drove people crazy.
Mind you, that is not unusual. There are plenty of books at Heathrow
airport which will do the same.''
The mention of special effects deterred him since he had just finished
Jurassic Park, the grand-daddy of special-effects movies, and was not
about to throw himself into another one immediately. It became obvious
after reading the script, however, that this was not a monster film.
''I am not in favour of horror films where people get slashed with
long knives and there are psychopaths on the loose. That is not the kind
of film I like. I don't subscribe to the view that films turn people
into loonies, and even if it were provable I am sure this would not be
one of those films.''
Neill said things had been going pretty nicely to date, although that
was not to say they would for ever. He had just finished directing a
documentary, The Cinema of Unease, for the BFI, part of its celebrations
of 100 years of cinema. The work was well received at the Cannes Film
Festival and he was rather encouraged to think about directing a feature
film next.
Had he anything in mind? ''There is a Scot called Ian Banks who writes
novels and science fiction,'' he said. ''I have never seen any of his
work on the screen and they seem to me to be crying out to be filmed.
One I would like to do is Cascade of Dreams, but you would probably need
a Waterworld budget and I cannot get my hands on one at the moment.''
What about the title of that documentary? It seems it is about growing
up in New Zealand and New Zealand culture, and he had realised, when he
looked at the country and the films made there, that it was a much
darker world than he had suspected. ''There is an uneasy relationship
between the races, between the European New Zealanders and the
landscape,'' he said. ''I don't pretend to give any answers. I just open
it up for debate.''
I wondered whether he had any sense of being a New Zealander, of
obligation to the country? He thought hard, and then said he was
certainly a New Zealander, but he was also part of an international film
community.
''I believe in the free flow of ideas and artists from country to
country,'' he added. ''It is difficult to answer the question and it is
no less easy on a personal level. I am as much a part of the Australian
scene, if not more so. I am also European. My passport says UK on it. It
is getting harder and harder to say where you are from these days -- and
where you want to go back to.''

I HAVE recently returned from a pilgrimage to Lourdes with Paisley
Diocese. Apart from the two plane loads of sick and helpers, there were
two coaches of youth.
Those boys and girls undertook a 30-hour coach trip each way, paying
their own fares and hotel bills, to help the sick. They pushed
wheelchairs and pulled voitures (like large Bath chairs) up and down
hills, carrying heavy bottles of water to give drinks to the sick in a
heat none of us was used to.
They ran errands and helped in all sorts of menial tasks -- always
courteous and smiling. Some had been before and the first-timers,
despite being, exhausted, all vowed to go back next year.
In doing all this, they wore white T-shirts and kilts and made us all
proud of our Scottish youngsters. I asked one boy what his tartan was.
He replied: ''I don't know, my granny bought it for me from Shelter.''
They were admired and photographed by all nationalities who called out
in foreign accents, ''Scotland -- good!''
Not all young people are as bad as often portrayed.

PUBLICATION of the Government's openly giving #80m of taxpayers' money
to Jaguar is indeed a U-turn in policy, but it is really just what has
always been the case with high-profile projects getting, as in this
case, #60,000 per job created, while small businesses, which jointly
employ the highest numbers, get peanuts if anything.
We have also recently seen yearly funding in millions for Enterprise
Councils, etc, with no real valuation of cost per ''true'' job created.
Would most of these jobs not come anyway? And is it not fundamentally
wrong for taxpayers' money to be used in this way?
If you argue that new jobs should be assisted then all should surely
be assisted. Removal of the employer's stamp contribution would be the
place to start. Why tax employers per person and then give it away to
the chosen high-profile few?
Jaguar states that up to 5000 further jobs (estimated) will be
created. Are these new jobs? Surely any new employment creates spin-off,
not just car production.
Jaguar gets these huge sums per job but if the car fails then does it
return the cash, land, or buildings? I doubt it.
We have recently seen high-profile projects fail dramatically, for
example, HCI which was ''well researched and checked out'', but millions
were wasted.
What business wouldn't love #60,000 per job, which is probably the
total wage bill for two to three years? Small businesses might, if they
can face the paper work required, get 30% for a few months.

FROM time to time we see reports of grants allocated to this country
from the Economic Community. The full picture of UK payments to the EU
budget and what we get back is never given.
It may be revealing for readers to see the figures now available for
1992/93 published by the Government Central Statistical Office:
UK taxes paid to the EU....#6970m.
Returned to us in grants &amp; agricultural support...........#2810m.
Rebate negotiated by Mrs
Thatcher...................#1993m.
This shows we paid to the EU for that year #2167m more than we got
back.
The cumulative tax paid by the UK to the EU since we joined in 1973
amounts to some #20 billion net -- that is, after deducting all grants
and support given to us in that period.
It is planned (according to the Government expenditure plans, Cmd
2517, HM Treasury) that our contribution will rise in 1995/96 to #3457m,
or #66m a week.
Why are we paying out this huge drain on our resources? Isn't that
something readers ought to think about when reports of money being
allocated to Britain from the EU appear?

<HEADLINE>Flexible Friend likely to go MasterCard and four banks hold talks to replace Access</HEADLINE>

YOUR Flexible Friend may well vanish if talks between MasterCard and
the four UK High Street banks which own Access come to fruition.
Discussions are believed to be at an early stage which would lead to
the Access name being replaced by the Mastercard symbol over a period of
time.
But as far as the 6.3 million people holding Access cards issued by
the four banks are concerned there will be no practical difference.
The Access brand in Britain is owned by Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank, and
National Westminster, who each have a 30% stake, with The Royal Bank of
Scotland holding the remaining 10%.
The US-based MasterCard plastic cards payment system is in the process
of creating a single global brand and has found reluctance by British
cardholders to use their Access cards in Europe where the symbol is not
displayed.
There have been suggestions that the value of the Access brand could
be between #100m and #120m. But a spokesman for one of the banks said
that figure was highly speculative and it was too early to put a price
on the possible sale. He added that there were many hurdles still to
jump.
However, as far as the cardholder was concerned, the card would still
be underpinned as at present by MasterCard and what was happening was
''purely a branding exercise''.
One problem could be how the money would be divided up between the
banks as the Royal, with about 500,000 Access accounts, has just 7.7%
share although it has 10% of the Access brand.
The MasterCard system, which is the second-largest in the world after
Visa, was adopted by the four banks in the early 1970s to create a rival
to the successful Barclaycard which had been established in the late
1960s.
Over the intervening years, the competition between the two brands has
been intense with the market place pressures intensified by the
emergence of a plethora of competing smaller brands. Several hundred
thousand Access cards are also held by customers of other banks such as
the Clydesdale and TSB.
The four banks have always been reticent about disclosing the level of
profitability although in the late 1980s, some were losing money partly
due to fraud.
Three years ago, Lloyds considered the re-branding of its Access cards
to convert them to credit cards with the MasterCard logo. However, that
was not followed through although Lloyds customers, as are those at most
other banks, can now apply for Visa cards in addition.
This duality or bank membership of both systems has been a major
disadvantage in marketing as any advance in one is immediately demanded
from the other and so blurring the distinctions. It is thought, however,
that banks profit slightly more from MasterCard than from Visa.

TEN years ago past June, Jonathan Edwards won his first triple jump
contest. Representing Durham University, he claimed the Scottish title
with 15.09 metres. The feat received barely a mention even on Tyneside,
his home, where the sporting media was preoccupied that summer with
world records by Steve Cram, at the mile, 1500, and 2000 metres.
In the narrow world of triple jumping, it was unmemorable, ranking him
twenty-seventh in the UK, and within a week, Willie Banks set a world
record of 17.97m.
''I never thought then I'd be a British record-holder one day,'' said
Edwards, recalling his Meadowbank victory. ''I can remember winning that
Scottish title, but I was just competing for enjoyment . . . the
north-east tradition was all about distance running.''
Edwards flew home to Newcastle yesterday, to his Scottish wife,
Alison, and two children, to find his picture on posters all over the
terminal building. Not because he had broken the world record the
evening before, but because the airport recently launched a junior
development scheme fronted by Edwards. There can have been few more
timely sponsorship initiatives.
The night before, in the slightly rarefied air of Salamanca, at 2500
feet, Edwards reached 17.98 metres, eclipsing by just a centimetre
Banks' mark -- the oldest field event record in athletics.
Salamanca, devastated by Hannibal's elephant troops in his march on
Rome, grew because it was on the Silver Road, the route used to carry
silver to Rome. Now Edwards hopes it is his route to World championship
gold next month in Sweden. He has already recorded the biggest jump in
history, 18.43m, slightly wind assisted at 2.4 metres per second, when
winning the Europa Cup title in Lille.
The first records in the event, which dates back to the fourteenth
century, are credited to professionals competing in Scottish Border
Games more than 150 years ago. Instead of the hop, step and jump, the
event was two hops and a jump.
No Briton has held the world record in the event this century. The
last world triple jump records set in the UK by British athletes were at
St Andrews, in university matches, in 1873 and 1881. The last world
records by British jumpers were by C B Fry (long jump, 1893) and the
Honourable Marshall Brooks (high jump, 1886).
The Olympic titles of 1906 and 1908 were won by Irishmen competing for
Great Britain, but no Briton has ever won a world or Olympic title --
indeed, Peter O'Connor, the 1906 winner, shinned up the flagpole and
tore down the Union Jack, replacing it with the Irish flag.
Edwards believes he can put the Union flag at the top of the pole in
Sweden. If he does, it will be the supreme moment for a man who has
defied all the odds to reach the top. During the winter, plagued by
viral problems, he was ready to quit and return to his job as a genetic
scientist.
At school, at West Buckland in Devon, rugby was his first love. He
played at stand-off, and could not even beat the team winger over 100m
at the school sports. The man who beat him was Victor Ubogu, now England
prop. ''I wouldn't mind racing him now,'' said Edwards.
When Edwards leapt 18.43m in Lille, world record holder Banks said:
''Who the hell is this guy? I've never even heard of him.'' Edwards was
surprised, having led the American for five rounds in Birmingham on
Banks' farewell tour. Last year he took away Banks' AAA record.

CLYDESDALE Financial Services, the successful retail finance company
which survived the collapse of Clydesdale Electrical Stores, has
purchased #7m of new debt from a subsidiary of Littlewoods Stores.
This is the largest in a series of new deals clinched by Clydesdale,
which is taking on staff to cope with the extra workload.
General manager Craig Murray said the company, which operates consumer
finance schemes on behalf of UK retailers, will probably have 100
employees by the end of the year.
That represents a doubling of the workforce since Clydesdale survived
the collapse of its former parent Clydesdale Electrical Stores in March
1994.
Clydesdale, which is owned by Club 24, a subsidiary of the Next group
of clothing stores, is planning to enlarge its Glasgow headquarters to
cope with the expansion.
Mr Murray said his firm purchased #7m of consumer finance debt from
Credit &amp; Data Marketing Services, a subsidiary of Littlewoods, which has
sold its entire consumer finance portfolio to concentrate on insurance.
This debt was contracted to purchase goods from Littlewoods and four
other retail chains, but Mr Murray said there is no guarantee that
Clydesdale will secure future business from these outlets.
Clydesdale is currently negotiating with these firms, which Mr Murray
declined to name, and hopes to add some of them to its client list.
''I would be happy if we got one or two into an ongoing relationship
with us,'' Mr Murray said.
Clydesdale clients already include several high profile firms such as
ScottishPower, National Tyre, and Texstyle World as well as a host of
smaller retailers.
Midlands Electricity and MEB Home Improvements have recently come on
board and Clydesdale has branched into a new line of business by signing
an account management agreement with Kleeneze Homecare.
The Bristol-based company sells cleaning equipment direct to
households through a network of agents and Clydesdale has developed a
special computer software to rationalise the dispatch of mail to its
customers.
Clydesdale aims to increase its level of annual advances to between
#22m and #24m this year from #16.5m in 1994.
But Mr Murray said this figure could climb further if a couple of
pilot schemes planned for two large Scottish retailers are firmed up
into fully fledged consumer finance agreements.
Clydesdale made a pre-tax profit of #1.35m and is forecasting an
improvement to at least #2m in 1995.

I WRITE in support of your correspondents who have raised the issue of
the selection school of the Church of Scotland. Further, I would wish to
support the many fine men and women who have offered their lives and
service to the full-time ministry of the Church only to be rejected by
its selection school.
For many years I have been involved as a parish minister with men and
women who wanted to enter the ministry in one way or another. To offer
oneself to the Church for service is, in itself, a deeply moving
experience. When rejection and hindrances are placed in an applicant's
path, real pain and distress are added to this experience.
There are three fundamental principles involved in this debate over
the Church of Scotland's selection school.
First, there is the cloak of silent secrecy that prevents the
applicant, his adviser, his family, and his minister from knowing why he
failed. The personal pain of rejection is compounded by the inability to
understand.
Secondly, I believe that there is now sufficient anecdotal evidence to
raise serious doubts about the methods of one selection school.
From my experience I would maintain that the wrong criteria are used
in the wrong way in the selection or rejection of potential candidates
for the full-time ministry of the Church of Scotland.
Finally, this debate highlights one feature in the Church of
Scotland's present parlous position. The committees in Church offices
appear in control while the voice of the people, the pew, and the parish
is disregarded.

THE summer of comic book cinema continues this week with a terrific
offering, Judge Dredd. Not being an aficionado of the original comic, I
have no idea whether the makers have done it justice, so the film must,
therefore, stand or falls on its own merits, and it stands tall. This
latest vehicle tailored to suit the macho talents of Sylvester Stallone
is rattling good fun. There have been better, more profound tales set in
the future than this one directed by Danny Cannon, but it has one merit
most of those lacked -- it is comparatively short at about 97 minutes.
In the dread world of Dredd, the Earth is a poisoned sphere, the bulk
of the people live imprisoned in vast, overcrowded cities where civil
war is endemic, while beyond their walls lies a sun-scorched wilderness
inhabited by outcasts, crooks and drug fiends. In the city, law and
order is maintained by the judges, a sort of superior force of traffic
wardens or wheel clampers, who enforce summary justice ranging from
fines to a prison sentence.
They ride to the scenes of riot, mayhem, and murder on huge black
motorcycles, which can also fly, dressed to the nines in black leather
biker gear with very large helmets.
There are different levels of judge. Dredd is a street judge, which
means he goes where no man dares in the Clint Eastwood manner, while Max
Von Sydow, the big cheese judge is a wise old cove who presides over the
highest court in the land -- with a little help from his nasty sidekick,
Jurgen Prochnow, and some ineffectual colleagues.
The difference between pretty boy and star was never better
illustrated, because for two weeks running we have had a hero seen only
from the nostrils down for much of the time. Stallone's granite jaw is a
masterpiece, which makes poor Val Kilmer's chin peeping from below his
Batman mask seem positively wimpish. When Stallone takes off his helmet
it is a no contest. Those ice cold blue eyes are to die for.
It is also refreshing to have a villain who is not an Englishman, but
an old fashioned nasty Nazi -- Prochnow. He is out to get rid of Von
Sydow, take over the world, and impose a strict law-and-order regime
with obvious fascist overtones. It is a case of Ve Haf Vays of Making
You do Vat Ve Vant. To this end he uses Rico, a super criminal (Armand
Assante), to do his dirty work. It turns out Rico is Dredd's twin.
The pair were artifically created test-tube babies, part of an
experiment set up by the judges to create a force of superhero judges to
run the world. Unfortunately Rico, a bad egg, had to be imprisoned for
life, the experiment abandoned, and the successful child, Dredd, left to
carry on the good work.
After Rico escapes battle commences with Dredd amid a welter of
machines doing things that take the breath away.
Although the special effects during the first half are genuinely
astonishing, as the story continues they do tail off a bit, and some
good plot ideas are not exploited.
The terrifying homicidal robot enlisted by Rico, for instance, is
simply abandoned after a few twitches, while his plan to give birth to
more Rico clones, so that there can be a new force of evil judges, only
gets as far as letting us see them stirring in their test tubes before
they get blown to smithereens. Maybe the money ran out.
Diane Lane as a feisty lady judge manages to get under Stallone's
defences -- even clones can fall in love -- Rob Schneider as a cowardly
computer hacker, who becomes his reluctant sidekick, adds a welcome
touch of comedy, and Assante has a truly tremendous line in villanous
sneering.
All those children who made Power Rangers last Christmas's
must-have-in-my-stocking toy will adore Mighty Morphin, Power Rangers,
the Movie, about their exploits. How could I possibly know? The preview
audience was composed mainly of children who were entranced by it and
left busily weighing up just where the film differed from and where it
was better than the television series.
The young actors who play the six Rangers, guardians chosen to keep
the world safe for mankind, may make the cast of Star Trek look like
actors, and the plot may be both complicated and meaningless, but this
is one of those critic-proof films best left alone unless they actually
preach false values. That it doesn't do. Indeed it strives hard to
preach the American way in the very best sense.
The Rangers' home city, Angel Grove, is threatened by a new to the
series super-villain, the evil Ivan Ooze, played by Paul Freeman. Ooze
plans to destroy the city and then the world using some magnificent
purple slime which will obliterate everything. The task facing the
gallant Six is to save civilisation as they know it from this vile
monster.
The ooze is terrific, the fighting robots thrilling, the balletic
battle between the Power Rangers and the stone guardians of the sacred
temple has been brilliantly choreographed. The language is clean, and
the violence so stylised it would not frighten even the most timid
child, but is sufficiently spectacular to keep the bloodthirsty amused.
All in all this is probably the perfect holiday movie.
Emir Kusturica won the Palme d'Or this year at Cannes for his film
Underground, a surreal fantasy about life in Yugoslavia starting during
the Second World War and coming up to the present day. It was bursting
with life, totally chaotic, occasionally inspired, and frequently banal.
There was, however, no denying it was a breathtaking piece of cinema.
Underground's success is the only reason Arizona Dream, his first
American film, has suddenly been taken down from somebody's shelf after
the past three years. While also chaotic, passionate, and packed with
curiosities, unlike Underground it is aimless, shapeless and
self-indulgent.
Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway, and Jerry Lewis are involved and all look
as if they wished they were somewhere else. So will you.

TIGHTER car safety standards are music to the ears of First
Technology's Dr Fred Westlake. An increasing number of European
manufacturers are fitting the fuel cut-out switches to the model ranges
and the latest catch is Renault which will start using them in
September.
The switch is often featured as a sales aid given that car safety is
the top of most purchasers' priorities.
Among the major European car makers only Volkswagen/Audi are not using
First switches but in the meantime sales into Asian countries such as
Korea and Japan are growing rapidly. Some manufacturers fear import bans
in the US and so are forced to more than meet American legislative
standards.
This may force them to buy First Technology's crash test dummies which
sell at anything between #20,000 and #70,000 apiece to help design cars
capable of meeting the standards for side impact as well as the more
traditional head-on collision safety requirements.
These will be more than sufficient to outweigh any possible downturn
in car production in the US and Japan with other manufacturing areas
likely to continue to show substantial increases.
Pre-tax profits in the year to April were well ahead of expectations,
rising 52% to #6.27m on turnover down 3.4% at #32.8m. The lower turnover
is a result of the ending of a two-year contract with General Motors.
The US giant took sensor manufacturing in-house but paid the company
royalties.
The outlook is for current year profits to advance to just above #8m
with most of the growth occuring in the second half.
That would leave the shares at 488p trading at 14 times likely
earnings where they represent good value even if the dividend yield on a
payout doubled to 7p is just 1.8% and there is substantial potential
from marketing software for computer simulation of crash dummies.

CONCERNING the tragedy of ethnic cleansing against the Muslim
population by Bosnian Serbs, French President Chirac's reported
criticism of United Nations ineffectual strategy which he compared with
the Western Allies' policy of appeasement towards Hitler is certainly
apposite.
This oldster recalls the writings of Germany's Pastor Niemoller,
preserved after his death at the hands of the Nazis:
''First they came for the Jews, I was silent, I was not a Jew.
''Then came the Communists, I was silent, I was not a Communist.
''Then they came for the trade unionists, I was silent, I was not a
trade unionist.
''Then they came for me . . . There was no one left to speak for me.''

IT'S apparent that the mealy-mouthed politicians of today are no
better than the posturings of Chamberlain in 1939 when Hitler overran
other people's territory unopposed.
We should forget all about international law, which is always ignored
by aggressors anyway. The response from Western politicians is always
too little too late.
We should have responded to the aggression by Serbia by force at the
beginning and arrested and put on trial the perpetrators.
It's unbelievable that we are still persisting in an arms embargo to
Bosnia, which is effectively tying their hands behind their backs while
the Serbians obviously have access to unlimited means to wage their war
of aggression.

A WEAKER US market for new vehicles hit Ford Motor's profits in the
second quarter although its earnings were still up slightly from the
first three months of the year.
Ford earned $1600m, or $1.45 per share, in the second quarter, down
from the record level of $1700m, or $1.63 a share, in the second quarter
of 1994.
The second-largest North American motor manufacturer cited lower
volumes in the US market for the decline, but said its European
operations showed an improved profit, helping to make the period Ford's
third-best second-quarter ever.
However, it added that lower production, investment in major product
introductions and the continued effect of exchange rates are expected to
dampen results from its automotive operations into the second half of
the year.

Stephen McGinty sees REM give Toronto an eye-opener
MICHAEL Stipe is a star. The Steve McQueen of the stage. He's the
Cooler King banging musical baseballs off a Toronto audience who are
less than animated. Forty minutes on stage at the Molson Amphitheatre
and Stipe is issuing instructions to Stand -- a song his band, REM,
didn't sing.
''You people sitting at the front. I'm sure there are people at the
back who couldn't afford those tickets. So if you'll please just stand
up or make way. Thank you.'' He's painfully polite and
characteristically cool, dressed in a dark-blue suit, orange T-shirt,
black shades and a stripey woollen-knit cap. The catatonic audience
should have worn hospital white. The blue star REM T-shirts are the only
signs of concert life.
People wander as Mike Stipe works. REM ground into gear with I Took
Your Name, and What's The Frequency, Kenneth? before a whole batch from
the Monster album including Circus Envy, Turn You Inside Out and Crushed
Eyeliner. It's an uphill struggle, but Stipe is relaxed, throwing each
song's lyrics with a little flourish.
Meanwhile Mike Mills jangles and sways in his silver lame cowboy suit,
guitarist Peter Buck is all wheels and roundabouts and Bill Berry is
solid and restored behind the drum kit.
Two scrapped SECC gigs in April lie among the wreckage of that fateful
night in March when Berry staggered off stage during a show in Lausanne,
Switzerland, with an aneurysm on the right side of his brain. Both the
band's future, and the continuation of their first world tour in six
years hung in the balance before a full recovery was announced.
0 Today the band are the biggest in the world, driven mainstream by
sales figures not artistic compromise. The last three albums Out Of
Time, Automatic For The People and Monster have sold millions and
physically distanced them from the crowd.
In Toronto stage-side projections light up the giant screens behind
the band with abstract films by directors Jim McKay, Jim Herbert and Gus
Van Sant. Fish swim across the speaker stacks mixing images of
disillusionment with youthful glee followed by gloom. Yet Stipe remains
the point of focus for the raised video screens.
New songs have been added to the constantly changing set which has
wound round Australasia and North America. The punky Revolution and
fuzz-filled Departure are but a couple of 13 finished songs being
recorded live for a new album.
The finale, It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)
was an emotional blitz which had embracing fans screaming ''time I had
some time alone'' without irony, till the sweat stung their eyes and
they couldn't see the stage, only listen as Stipe told them what they
already knew.
''That's Pete, That's Bill, That's Mikey and I'm Michael. We're REM.
We're happy to be here. It's been a long time.''
* REM play Murrayfield, their first Scottish date in six years, next
Thursday.

IF SARAJEVO FALLS, London falls. Not the physical entity, the great,
dilapidated imperial mausoleum on the Thames, but the symbol. Many
things can be said of Bosnia, and of Britain's failures there, but that
brutalised little country has become the graveyard of delusions. The
fantasy is over.
It has the feel of bathos, this last act. Forget the nuclear weapons
we cannot afford and dare not use; now we are talking of borrowing
helicopters from America to rescue 300 Welsh Fusiliers, of currying
favour with bandits, of saving face rather than lives. The British Army
can no longer stage its own retreats. What might Palmerston have said?
Few today remember the confidence-touching arrogance of the British
empire. In 1897, the year of Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, it was at its
height, a blood myth of pomp, gunboats, and Anglo-Saxon purity. After
the victories of 1945 exhaustion was palpable, reality had asserted
itself, and the end was in sight. But even a Labour Government could
still believe the power that had once commanded the world was still a
world power.
Should we mourn? Probably not. Empires are designed to fall; it is one
of the few compensations history offers. Yet in the dissembling of
Malcolm Rifkind and the appeasement offered as an honourable response to
the Bosnian debacle by John Major lies a record of how far and how fast
Britain has fallen. Think of this: if the Falklands War were to happen
tomorrow, the United Kingdom would be incapable of sustaining a task
force, never mind a campaign.
Perhaps it doesn't matter. Few small countries are truly capable of
defending themselves and are content, with a brace of ceremonial
regiments and a couple of little ships at hand, to admit the fact. Then
again, few small nations expect to have the voice in world affairs to
which Britain still lays claim.
It is a curious thing, the myth of British influence. Douglas Hurd
called it ''punching above our weight'', meaning that our history,
experience, and statecraft enable us to achieve more in the world than
our economic and military power should allow. By punching above our
division, he believed, we can better protect our own interests, act as
an honest broker, and, given a unique trio of relationships with Nato,
the EU, and the Commonwealth, ensure we have a finger in every pie.
Hurd was talking nonsense, of course. His were words of comfort if
they were not just an empty boast. Bosnia has been one example of
Britain's insignificance, but there are others. Within the EU we are at
best a nuisance, with a voice so powerful no-one understands a word we
say. At the UN we stand (and probably deserve) to lose our seat on the
Security Council in the very near future. Our influence on the
Commonwealth is nil; our ''special relationship'' with the US a joke.
Sterling, whose movements could once break nations, is irrelevant.
We have our nukes, for what they're worth, but these are expensive
toys allowed to us by the Americans in exchange for obedience. We could
not use them without the permission of the White House and we would not
dare, even when the British taxpayer is subsidising US defence
industries, to think of doing so.
The story of Britain's decline is an old one, of course, but Bosnia
draws a line under the account. Here the bluff has at last been called,
the dangerous lie that Her Majesty's Government could make a difference
in the world exposed. All those Bosnians who believed Great (it takes
nerve still to use the word) Britain had the will to rescue them know
better now. Some had to die to find out.
Weakness in the British style manifests itself in all sorts of ways,
but self-deceit is its most obvious symptom. Does Rifkind really take
pride in our Bosnian adventure when British policy amounts only to
scheming to prevent the French from carrying the fight to the fascists
while making sure the Americans do nothing to arm the victims? If
Britain were only a small nation admitting it had no power to act we
would at least retain our self-respect. Instead, we have become a small,
duplicitous nation fighting for nothing more than the illusion of
greatness.
Britain is not dangerous because it is small and weak; Britain is
dangerous because it is small and weak and acts as if it were strong.
No-one believes we could have intervened in Bosnia alone but our
politicians, diplomats, and placemen (step forward, Lord Owen) have
ensured that any united Western action is impossible. And by refusing
publicly to take sides in the war we have -- call it a crime of omission
-- privately chosen our side.
There is no reason to believe a Labour Government would have behaved
better. Britain's decline touches all parties, manifests itself in
political corruption, in the movement for Scottish home rule, in the
ideological conversion of the Westminster parties, in public squalor and
private greed.
When the ship of state goes down, all hands go with it.
Bosnia, nevertheless, is the definitive disaster. After two world wars
fought and, with huge effort, won we cannot now even read a map of the
Balkans, nor find a way either to fight or to extricate ourselves. This
needn't matter much to the rest of the world, but it matters to the
people who welcomed our peacekeepers, who believed us when we told them
what we would and would not tolerate.
All this ought to be recognised universally as a disgrace, yet the one
clear truth about the politicians who continue to pretend Britain still
counts for something is that they seem neither humiliated nor ashamed.
That, perhaps, is all the evidence of decline anyone needs.

MERGER talks with Fisons may have broken down because of disagreement
over terms but pharmaecuticals group Medeva is confident about both its
immediate and long-term future as an independent company.
Indeed, Medeva's chairman, Bernard Taylor, thinks that the takeover
frenzy that has engulfed the whole sector in the UK and US in the past
year is good news for Medeva.
It is actively seeking acquisitions in its core product areas of
vaccines and respiratory drugs and these often come about when larger
groups dispose of their non-core businesses following merger activity.
Fisons represented just one among many growth opportunities for
Medeva. If successful the merger would have catapulted Medeva into the
big time and at the same time fulfilled some of Medeva's strategic
goals, such as a larger presence in Continental Europe.
In addition, Fisons' asthma and allergy products would have been
complementary to Medeva's existing product portfolio.
Even though the merger talks have broken down, Medeva's strategy
remains unchanged, namely to develop into a significant self-sustaining
pharmaceutical company. It intends to do this by developing its own
respiratory and vaccine products and through acquisitions, particularly
of products in late-stage development. During the talks with Fisons,
Medeva acquired the diptheria and tetanus vaccines of Wyeth in the US.
Medeva is confident that its tried and tested strategy will continue
to deliver the goods. Certainly the medicine seems to be working at
least at the moment. Profits in the six months to June 30 grew by a
healthy 31% to #28.9m. Sales, at constant exchange rates, rose by 11%
and the interim dividend was raised by 27% to 1.4p.
A key factor behind the strong profits was the continued growth in US
demand for Methylphenidate, a drug which is prescribed for hyperactive
children under a strict quota. Its use is much less in the UK where a
different non-drug approach is adopted for treating such children.
Its sales advanced by 43% as prescriptions grew and it increased its
market share. Although competition to Methylphenidate is rising,
Medeva's chief executive, Dr Bill Bogie, is confident that
Methylphenidate has a prosperous future not least because the market is
expected to grow and it will take time for the new competition to get
regulatory approval from the US authorities.
Elsewhere in the group, demand for its products remains weighted
towards the second half. In the vaccine division, production capacity
for its flu vaccine Fluvirin, has been stepped up as a result of a 40%
increase in the order book.
Within the next few years Medeva should benefit from royalty payments
for its acellular whooping cough vaccine marketed by SmithKline Beecham.
In the longer term, Medeva has high hopes for its dry-powder inhaler
for asthma, currently undergoing trials, and Hepagene, its Hepatitis B
vaccine. Medeva is financially strong with net cash balances at the
half-year-end of #28m and positive net cashflow.
Medeva appears to have recovered the credibility in the stock market
that it lost 18 months ago after a profit warning which led to a slump
in the share price.
The stock quickly recovered from the news that the merger talks had
broken down and, according to Mr Taylor, the price is at a more sensible
level. Yesterday Medeva shares were at 228p down 1p.

FOR over a week now Dundee has been savouring Homemade Pieces -- a
season of shows rooted in the creative energies of the local community,
including this quite outstanding piece of community dance.
Guest choreographer Andy Howitt chose a subject close to his heart:
the opera that might have been if Dylan Thomas had lived to collaborate
(as planned) with Igor Stravinsky. They had envisaged a radical new
version of the Adam and Eve story and ID/53 echoes these ideas, building
to a powerful conclusion when the apple -- with all its forbidding
connotations of sinfulness and downfall -- becomes instead a source of
positive enlightenment, enabling everyone to leave Eden in a spirit of
purposeful endeavour.
The piece opened with figures in everyday clothes moving across the
forestage, pausing, scanning the horizon, journeying on and ever on.
Behind them, gradually visible through the gauze -- a white-clad Eve
glided gracefully round a huge tree made out of hollow plastic pipes,
some with concealed lights that added to the atmospheric colour washes
used throughout.
Into this Eden streamed the community of travellers, garbed
identically in wide-leg pants of darkest blue flaring into orange -- a
stunningly theatrical moment in a beautifully crafted piece where the
community group functioned like a Greek chorus, both witnessing and
advancing the action to spicy, jazzy music by Keiran Cheung.
Whatever the individual ability, Howitt's choreography made everyone
look good without short-changing the dynamics of the dance or
surrendering all the main moments to the three professionals in the
central roles.

TITUS is very much a play for today, a vision of unbridled human
savagery that is sadly as prevalent as ever. In some ways though, too,
it is grand guignol -- its mutilations and barbarism expressed not only
with a fine rhetorical flourish but undercut by wicked irony. Titus, the
great warrior-turned-chef, serving his newly baked crusty pie to Tamora,
Queen of the Goths, made from her own sons has all of the flavour of
Sondheim's Mrs Lovett extolling the virtues of her human spiced pies in
Sweeney Todd.
This joint production by the National Theatre Studio and
Johannesburg's mighty Market Theatre -- the shining light of resistance
and multiculturalism during apartheid -- is that it contains both these
aspects of humour and horror, pathos and intimidatory ugliness. It shows
how stale and lifeless most English productions of Shakespeare have now
become.
Even if you find it hard to stomach or find some of its implications
puzzling, the vitality and energy sweeping off the stage makes it a
hundred times more entertaining than most home-grown Shakespearean
productions. Perhaps it is the freshness the actors bring to it, perhaps
the eery parallels with their own country torn apart in blood-letting
for so long that give it such life.
Whatever, these Roman princes and warring factions in the imperial
city that has become ''a wilderness of tigers'' look as though they have
stepped straight out of contemporary newsreels. Afrikaner, township
beggar, proud Zulu, it's all here with Antony Sher's Titus, a
tremendous, grizzled, Lear-like old Afrikaner loyalist, Dorothy Ann
Gould impressive as a spitting, sexy, viperous Tamora, and an
outstanding Aaron from Sello Maake ka Ncube.

NIGERIA'S military Government is adding to its domestic difficulties
by flouting international opinion. It is rare to find a member state
threatened with expulsion from the Commonwealth -- pre-reformed South
Africa was the exception -- but the threat of that possibility in
Nigeria's case is being talked about openly and is bound to be discussed
at the next Commonwealth summit in Auckland, New Zealand, later in the
year. Among friendly states which have voiced their doubts about the
policies of the military regime are France, Canada, and the United
States, which last has just refused an entry visa to a member of General
Abacha's administration. The regime's response is to dismiss all foreign
criticism as ''biased and unsoundly motivated'', with criticism from
this country attracting the threat of retaliatory moves against the
local assets of Shell and BP, the operators of the lucrative oil
industry. Oil is the only sector of the country's industrial activity
which is operating at full tilt -- much of the rest is running at around
20% of capacity -- but oil is vulnerable to international pressure, and
talk of an embargo on its exports, Nigeria's main source of hard
currency earnings, should not be ignored.
The reason for this situation is the military dictatorship, the way in
which it annulled the results of the last presidential election in 1993
and has maintained a regime of repression ever since, being acutely
hostile to any form of democratic activity or the expression of even
modestly critical press opinion. Its announcement at the start of the
week that the findings of a military tribunal into an alleged coup plot
involved 14 death sentences and 11 life imprisonments has raised a storm
of protest. The hearings were conducted in secret and the foundations of
the sentences are simply impossible to judge. Justice has certainly not
been seen to have been done, and opinion is bitterly opposed to
implementing such severe punishments. Nigeria has had a long history of
coups against its various governments and 117 people have been executed
for participating in them these past 20 years. The question is whether
General Abacha will be willing to consider clemency lest it makes him
appear weak in the face of popular clamour and foreign pressure. He may
even feel that if he gives that impression his rule is doomed.
He is committed to restoring civilian rule on October 1 this year (the
anniversary of Nigeria's independence), but earlier promises to the same
end were not kept. He will find it difficult to hand over power
peacefully if he acts savagely now: some knowledgeable foreign observers
fresh from the country are predicting another Nigerian civil war in the
near future unless feelings are allowed to calm. Implementing the
sentences of the military court must inflame rather than calm. There are
many other good reasons for recommending clemency in this case but
raison d'etat is the one which might appeal most to General Abacha and
he should be left in no doubt that is exactly what is involved; his own
survival in power may depend on the velvet glove rather than the iron
fist all know he can wield.

THE following tragic words, spoken by a badly-wounded Bosnian soldier,
appeared in your front-page report, Rape ordeal of refugee women (July
14): ''We lost our three-year-old son in this last offensive. We were
not even able to bury him properly. I am very, very bitter about the
international community because it allowed the Cetniks (Serbs) to kill
my son. My son didn't have a gun and put no Serbs in jeopardy.''
Margaret Vaughan has elucidated my arguments -- more eloquently and
forcibly -- in her column (July 15). These included observations
concerning the 84-year-old man charged with war crimes, and the apparent
enthusiasm of the Western Allies for the Gulf war in 1990-91.
What is there left to say? Simply that we must believe that those who
died in Europe 50 years ago, including millions of innocent children,
did so for a noble principle tha transcended the mere need to teach
Germany a lesson in politics. They died for a just world, a New Europe.
I detest war, yet somehow in the carnage and outrage that is now
Bosnia we have to prove to ourselves that the world once again that man
was created by God in His own image.

THE long vac is upon us. Not that MPs really have 12-weeks' holiday,
of course, they go home to commune with their constituents, to take
stock, to test the temperature, to see and be seen. Not for them the
deck chair and the sun block -- they are out there winning hearts and
minds, promising that good times are just around the corner.
Mrs, nay, Lady Thatcher, she who prefers to be known as Maggie, was
one who particularly hated holidays; remember those awful pictures when
she was seen exercising some reluctant hound on a deserted beach, Denis
stage left, his eyes searching for the nearest golf course. Maggie
longed to be summoned back to a crisis; ''just don't tell me there isn't
one.''
I used to have a lovely man as my political deputy. All his best
anecdotes began: ''It was one of the times you were away . . .''
Once he summoned the regional council's chief executive to his office.
''I think we should consider ourselves on red alert,'' he pronounced.
''There is something happening here and we are not going to rest until
we find out what it is.'' He never took holidays.
But let us imagine what kind of reception the honourable member,
released from the madhouse that is Westminster in high summer, will
encounter as he promenades along his local high street. What will the
civilians be telling him about the state of the nation some 90-weeks or
so before the next General Election? What hope does he have of holding
his seat?
Imagine -- go on be a devil -- what it is like to be one of Scotland's
Tory MPs, marked down for personal oblivion as certain as anyone who
crosses the Mafia. You've seen the polls, you've been to the local
elections -- wasn't that a fun night? -- and some of your most loyal
supporters have told you their vote is going somewhere, anywhere, else.
Are you showing your face at all?
Yes, of course you are, and maybe you are receiving a better reception
than you could have hoped for. It was significant, I thought, that every
Scottish constituency, even Bigglesland, declared for Mr Major. They
like John north of the Border, far better than they ever cared for
Herself, and the longer he is around the more he becomes accepted as
part of the political furniture.
But the polls, the polls, the polls make you dead. Let me tell you
this, folks -- voters, and particularly Tory voters, lie through their
teeth to the pollsters, it is official party policy. If, when the big
one is held in this part of the country, the Tories score only 11% and
republican Roseanna is not sent back where she deserves to be I shall
demolish the crystal ball.
What about the demon Michael -- how will he play in subsidised,
socialist Scotland? Pretty well I would guess.
Many things I have said about Mr Forsyth, none of them suggesting he
is a fool. I am told on the QT that the boundary changes to his Stirling
constituency are not nearly as damaging as he made out and that he is
quite confident of holding on.
You will hear from smiling, kindly young Michael -- over and over
again -- that Scotland is leading the economic recovery in the UK, that
to give that up for a mess of Labour potage would be foolish in the
extreme. And, though they may not put blue posters in their windows,
many Scots, those in work and prospering, will heed what he tells them.
Mr Scottish Tory MP is not nearly so suicidal as he was six months
ago.
So what of Mr Blair's boys, practically selecting their seats on the
next government front bench just a short time ago? Are they quite as
certain of success as they once were? I think Mr Scottish Labour MP
might find some confusion, maybe even a little bit of disillusionment
among his loyal support. I mean, this young Tory, the rather rich public
schoolboy and graduate who is about to challenge the establishment, why
exactly is he cosying up to Mr Rupert Murdoch? After all, this is the
same Rupert whose Scottish organ tells us every day that we should rise
up and throw off our English yolk.
Why, when RM snaps his fingers, is Tony off to Oz to curry favour like
a naughty boy doing penance? Labour, Mr Blair tells us, was unelectable
in the 80s. Do you remember him saying that at the time?
And are we quite sure that Tony can deliver the promised manna in the
shape of a Scottish parliament, the ultimate answer to all our problems?
I only ask because the English regional devolution plans appear to be in
shreds and tatters. It couldn't happen here -- could it?
Mr Scottish Labour MP might just be asked by his working-class
constituents -- remember them, they have not had much courting of late?
-- what a Blair government would do for the less well off. Will there be
a minimum wage, how much will it be, will I be worse off tax-wise in
Scotland than the rest of the UK?
Hang on, let us not worry ourselves about actual policies, we know
everyone is sick of the present Government. The media are particularly
tired of them and we can rely on them because they told us Mr Major was
finished as the leader of his party.
The Labour Party, the one that runs most of our councils so well, is
guaranteed the Scottish vote.
Happy holiday.

WELL might we weep for poor Bosnia and the anguish of its beleagured
peoples. It would seem that the only palliative currently on offer is
humanitarian aid, welcome though that must be in the circumstances.
Perhaps I am being a mite cynical to suggest that if by some miracle
geologists were suddenly to announce that this tragic country was
literally floating on a sea of oil how different the scenario might
quickly become.
Instead of the prevailing mood of vacillation presently being
displayed by the powers-that-be, such an unexpected discovery would see
the military machine galvanised into immediate and positive action,
providing it with a legitimate excuse to see off the aggressor in double
quick time.
Remember the Gulf war? An issue which was settled in a matter of
weeks, if not in days, and nothing like the three years of suffering
that the Bosnian peoples hav had to endure thus so far.
All despite the presence of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force,
which to all intents and purposes appears impotent in the face of such
unbridled naked aggression and evil intent.
In the unlikely event of such a hypothetical occurrence taking place,
I suspect that the pogrom of ethnic cleansing would be the least of the
problems that would be confronting the Serbian forces as a consequence.

<TEXT>
The European Commission has approved the acquisition by Swissair of a
49.5% stake in Belgian airline Sabena which will create the
fourth-biggest airline in Europe.
The Commission said that the plan by the Belgian Government to repeal
the special social contributions relating to pilots and air crews, which
could have been considered subsidies for the loss-making Sabena, did not
affect competition in the sector and corrected ''an anomalous
situation''.
On the key issue of Sabena remaining under European Union control
despite the takeover by Swissair, which is based in Switzerland, a
non-EU country, the Commission took the view that it had sufficient
guarantees that this would be the case.
Under the terms of the agreement between the two airlines finalised in
May, Swissair has an option under what the Commission said were
''certain very strict conditions'' to buy enough additional shares at a
future date to give it a majority holding.

Elizabeth Westcott investigates a project to alter Glasgow's record as
one of the unhealthiest cities in Europe
VISITORS to Glasgow, strolling around the silky green slopes of
Kelvingrove Park or the sophisticated streets of the city centre would
never guess that it houses some of the greatest health inequalities of
the European Union.
The variation in health between affluent and deprived areas is
startling. Over a third of the premature deaths in Glasgow are
associated with the differences between rich and poor, and life
expectancy is 10 years shorter in disadvantaged areas. Last year the
Glasgow Healthy City Project took a decisive step towards combating
these deeply rooted problems by adopting a concept used in the Third
World: lay community health workers.
Twelve people were selected from Easterhouse, Possil and a third area
which combines Milton, Ruchill, Gorbals and Cambuslang. They were
trained in health promotion, community development, group work and
research skills at Strathclyde University. According to project
co-ordinator Rod MacNamara, the fact that these lay workers have
ready-made community networks gives them a head start on their agency
counterparts.
''When we advertised for the health workers one of the criteria was
they had to come from the area they were going to work in,'' he says.
''They also had to have an experience of commitment to that community,
and some grasp of health and health issues.
''Each has to profile their own area, finding out what the people
there think is important, and they are in the process of developing
strategies. It's a bottom-up rather than top-down approach. The experts'
and the community's agendas are so often the same, but the methods used
to achieve those goals are different.''
In fact, lay health workers are likely to succeed where the experts
fail, for two reasons. First, they are familiar with the inner rhythms
of the community rather than how it appears on the surface; they know
that the community may be more concerned with a local drug problem than
changing their eating habits, for example. They have also experienced
the wide range of social circumstances that can dramatically impact on
health status.
''They are working to a social rather than a medical model of
health,'' MacNamara explains. ''The medical model concentrates on the
individual lifestyle, smoking, drinking, cutting down disease -- that's
very important, but considering things like housing, unemployment,
poverty, or gender are equally important as regards health.
''If it was just passing on information, you could open up a shopfront
with a few leaflets. It is only by starting up a dialogue that people
can be empowered to make informed choices about health.''
The lay health workers are in a unique position to open up this
dialogue. They are not outsiders armed with statistics and quit-smoking
campaigns which can sometimes be counter-productive; even the best of
intentions can go awry if they lack context. But they don't perform
their tasks in isolation.
MacNamara describes the project as a vehicle for collaboration between
a variety of health agencies. ''Community education workers, health
visitors and health promotion officers all provide the health workers
with professional advice,'' he explains.
As Possil lay worker Sadie Gordon points out, the local health worker
is seen to be more accessible than the health agencies. ''We've got a
good response so far -- a lot of people feel frustrated by the health
centre but we can help them access it. We'll sit down and have a cup of
tea and talk about it -- their problems are our problems.''
The often multitudinous concerns faced by communities such as Milton,
Possil and Easterhouse will not be miraculously solved. The project was
launched only last November, and the health workers are still in the
process of devising strategies for their areas. It's early days, but the
way forward seems to be with small, manageable projects which will
gradually infiltrate the community.
MacNamara says: ''In Easterhouse, for example, they are working with a
breast-feeding group. It may not seem much on the surface, but it's once
you've got a group of women meeting regularly who have all the same
experience of issues like poverty and gender that they begin to develop
self-confidence. They start developing their own health issues. It's a
process of empowerment.''
Linda Dolan, a health worker for Milton, believes the strength of the
Glasgow Healthy City Project lies in getting communities to decide for
themselves what they need, rather than being told by outsiders. ''My
opinion is that it's about time we were asked,'' she says bluntly. ''We
live and work in Milton, so we won't do anything that's going to come
back on us -- we're very conscious of what we're doing.
''The problems in Milton are so wide and varied that everything was
getting targeted; health, safety, education, drugs. That's where the
agencies haven't always worked in the past. Now the community is
prioritising the problems and looking at how each one needs to be
addressed.''
Children aged between eight and 12 are the focus of a current Milton
initiative. Dolan and her fellow health workers are devising a project
involving aspects of health and safety and the environment. ''Kids will
be adults in 10 years' time. In this project we are looking at how they
see Milton, and what they would like to see in Milton in the future.''
In Easterhouse health worker Stuart McFarlane is also working with
primary school children. Teachers, he says, were concerned that five and
six year olds were falling asleep at school because of late nights in
front of the television or video games. His four-week programme
emphasised the importance of sleep, diet, exercise and general health.
Despite unemployment, inadequate slum-clearance housing and a feeling
of apathy, McFarlane is not depressed by the magnitude of the problems
Easterhouse faces. ''I am an eternal optimist. Personally I think the
project is innovative -- the health workers understand the problems in
the area. We know we won't fix them overnight, we're not superhuman. But
the collective voice is powerful.''
Possil Park has been described as a vandalised war zone and as the
drug capital of Britain, but Sadie Gordon, who has lived there most of
her life, believes unemployment and material deprivation are the area's
main concerns. Experience has taught her that changing attitudes can be
the most difficult hurdle to overcome.
''Some people just won't accept that poverty causes ill-health,'' she
sighs. ''At a meeting you can be talking to people and they absolutely
refuse to admit that there is poverty -- even if they live 200 yards
away from it.''
What clearly emerges from the work of the Glasgow Healthy City Project
is the unambiguous relationship between deprivation and health. Real
inroads in altering its health inequalities will not be made until
crucial social issues are addressed, and they go far beyond urging
people to have a varied diet or stop smoking.
''I think we have to show people a different kind of life --
especially the youth,'' says Gordon. ''There's no money for anything; as
soon as you suggest money a door slams. It's always a struggle, but
we're trying very hard.''
The records they're determined to break
* Glasgow's premature death rate is 35% higher than the Scottish
average.
* For lung cancer, Glasgow is 50% higher than the Scottish average.
* For respiratory disease, Glasgow is more than 80% higher than the
Scottish average.
* For other major causes of premature death, Glasgow is 30-40% above
the Scottish average.
* Deprived areas of Glasgow compared to more affluent areas:
* Life expectancy is 10 years less for deprived Glasgwegians than for
those in more affluent areas.
* More babies are born with low birthweights in deprived areas.
* Death from lung cancer is 80% more likely for women from Easterhouse
and Possil than elsewhere in Glasgow.
* Death from heart disease is 60% more likely for men from these
areas.

WEIR Pumps has received #3m of new orders for specialist pumps that
will inject water into North Sea oilfields to boost oil recovery, writes
ROBERT POWELL.
The stainless steel pumps will be built at Weir Group's main factory
in Glasgow for delivery to the Scott oilfield operated by Amerada Hess
and BP's Gyda field in the Norwegian sector.
''It shows there is still a lot of activity in the North Sea and it
confirms our position as one of the largest suppliers of specialist
pumps to the industry,'' a Weir Group spokesman said.
He said Weir Group was currently negotiating a #6m deal to sell
turbo-drilling equipment to an unidentified client in the Middle East.
The equipment, used to drill curving and horizontal sections of oil
wells, would be manufactured by the group's Neyrfor-Weir subsidiary in
Aberdeen.
Machinery designed for use in the oil industry will account for about
#100m of Weir Group's expected #600m turnover this year.

AT last ''the Sleeping Warrior'' is stirring.
First of all I pick up a leaflet to read that there is now an Arran
Open Top Bus Tour. Great.
Secondly, I read your report about the Discovery Centre -- lovely
idea, historical, geographical, etc -- to learn a bit more about this
lovely island.
Last but by no means least (enjoying the odd ''dram'' myself) is the
news regarding the new distillery at Lochranza.
Arran has long been a happy family-holiday island. So I say, ''Go to
it, Arran islanders, and send these sour-grape Sassenachs back to
England to think again.''

THE training and development article profiling the work of a designer
was a welcome insight into a profession that too often achieves
anonymity (July 18). Moreover, good design can not only be big business
but good design is good business.
Design is a corporate asset. It must be reviewed and managed more
closely. Not only can it control a company's identity but it also can
have a major impact on how a company serves its customers.
Effective use of industrial design can reduce product development
time, serve as a source of ideas, contribute to faster and more
effective communication, and provide a three-dimensional visualisation
of the long-term strategy of the company.
Successful utilisation of design is not limited to major corporations.
Many small companies have grown in part due to the successful
utilisation of design. Moreover, designers ensure there is an effective
link between the objectives and strategies of the corporation and the
design resource.
In short, designers, and particularly Scottish designers, deserve the
acclaim and prestige that accompanies titles like the one attained by
Glasgow City of Architecture and Design 1999.

UK data reinforcing a slowdown in domestic economic growth had little
effect on the pound.
Its trade-weighted index remained at 83.7 with sterling virtually
unchanged against a stable dollar at $1.5962. It was also slightly
cheaper than the German mark at DM2.2130.
Minutes published from the monthly meeting between Chancellor of the

WE reported earlier this week that a US publisher had offered to all
of Scotland's ministers a free copy of its new translation of the Bible.
World Publishers of Iowa describes its version of God's Word as putting
the words of the good book ''into their closest natural equivalent
meaning in North American English''.
Thus the splendour of the King James translation of the Bible is
rendered into everyday, indeed commonplace, language. The magical words
from the Songs of Solomon, chapter two, verse five, change from: ''Stay
me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am sick of love'' to
''Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am weak with
love''.
The shortest and perhaps most graphic verse in the Bible (John 11, 35)
is ''Jesus wept.'' Our American version is: ''Jesus cried.''
Further on in John 11, 39 the words ''Lord, by this time he stinketh:
for he hath been dead four days'' become ''Lord, there must already be a
stench. He's been dead for four days.''
Majestic phrases such as ''gird up your loins'' become ''put on your
belt'' and ''rent his mantle'' is turned into ''tore his robe''. One
Corinthians 13 begins in the King James version with: ''Though I speak
with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as
sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.'' This becomes the mundane: ''I
may speak in the languages of humans and angels. But if I don't have
love, I am a loud gong or clashing cymbal.''
The stirring words of Mark 10, 49, ''Be of good comfort, rise; he
calleth thee'' are reduced to ''Cheer up! Get up! He's calling you.''
Yea and verily we will return to the American version of the Bible.
Meanwhile, as the Lord no doubt said, have a nice day.
Instant hit
THE offer of free drugs to the audience should pull in the crowds for
a show called The A-Z of Drugs at the Assembly Rooms during the
Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
Those used to harder substances may be disappointed when they discover
that the drugs include coffee, tea, chocolate, and beer. The show is a
''thrill-seeker's guide . . . a mind-expanding comic odyssey''. It would
not be possible, of course, to achieve this state on just tea and
chocolate.
Thus the stash which performers James Poulter and Graham Duff will be
sharing also includes herbal ecstasy and khat. The latter being the
leaves of an East African shrub which, when chewed, have a stimulant
effect.
Epic double bill
US chaps at the Diary don't like it when movies go on too long --
about 90 minutes is usually fine. The Edinburgh Film Festival, however,
is taking brevity to extremes with two works by film-maker Vito Rocco.
His two movies featured at the festival this year, Ciao Mamma and
Buona Fortuna, each lasts seven seconds. We don't want to spoil it for
potential cinema-goers by giving away the plot of either film, but we
can tell you that Ciao Mamma is an emotive tale of a young boy facing
the uncertainty of adulthood and that he wears a hand-knitted tanktop
which is a metaphor for his loneliness and isolation.
Mark Cousins, director of the Edinburgh Film Festival, describes it as
''a small but perfectly formed film. It condenses all the emotions
normally found in a feature-length film into seven seconds of
terrifyingly accurate brilliance.''
Buona Fortuna, the other half of this epic double bill, is described
as ''a film about two people looking scared in front of wallpaper''. It
says here in Vito Rocco's biography that he ''originally studied
oceanography in Acapulco but soon became enmeshed in the motion picture
industry and before long he found himself working for a small Mexican
studio as an underwater fight choreographer''.
All of the above may well be a spoof. It is very hard to tell
sometimes with your Edinburgh festivals. If it is true, we would like a
half-pint of what Mr Rocco is on.
The Name Game
APROPOS of not a lot we thought we would tell you that the
Westmoreland Gazette of Cumbria runs a Spot the Dog competition based on
snaps from sheepdog trials. One of the outlets where readers may leave
their entries is a newsagent called D&amp;H Woof.
Chain mail
DIARY reader Len Gilligan of Troon writes with an insight into the
strange workings of the Royal Mail. Having moved to a new address in
Troon, Mr Gilligan applied to have his mail redirected. For this he had
to send a form to a Royal Mail office in Inverness. Acknowledgement of
his request came from the Royal Mail's office in George Square, Glasgow,
in an impressive yellow envelope bearing the message: ''Electronic Post
-- this letter was tranferred electronically to Royal Mail for delivery
today.'' It was dated June 29.
Very hi-tech, but there was no explanation as to why the envelope did
not arrive until July 4 and in the interim had collected a Stockport
postmark for June 30 and a Wishaw postmark for July 1.
Domestic bliss
WE had never thought of Elie in Fife as being an especially up-market
place. But it must be. In its newsletter, the Elie Sports Club informs
members that family membership does not include au pairs.
Gazza Jr
WE read that Gazza's bidey-in, Sheryl Kyle, is with child and further
note that one of her two existing offspring is a lad called Mason. We
hesitate to interfere in how people might choose to name their children
but if the next one is a boy, Boyne Gascoigne has a certain ring to it.

SCOTTISH American Investment Company, universally known as Saints, is
maintaining its record of steady dividend increases with a second
interim payment of 1.24p, a rise of 3.3% on last year.
In the six months to June net assets per share rose 3.4% to 177.3p. In
the same period the FTSE-100 index was 8.6% ahead but Saints' total
return performance was marginally ahead of its sector average.
The asset value has since improved further to about 184p and the
shares stand at a 9.4% discount.
The trust is about 60% invested in the UK, 10% in the Far East, 7% in
North America, 8% in Europe and 4% in Japan. Fixed interest investment
represents some 10% of the portfolio.
Income before tax in the six months rose 21% to #7.08m. Expenses were
6.5% higher at #3.32m.

quayside. Inanimate objects are encouraged to perform in Farquhar's art,
so the ship deserved the right of reply to his accusation that the
river, which Glasgow was built around, was now a dead place.
In fact its lonely manoeuvres only proved the remark. For the previous
hour not a thing had disturbed the mill pond in front of Meadowside
Quay. Glasgow's role as a major port was clearly the stuff of history.
For that hour Farquhar had talked of history. For one week only he was
lord of all he surveyed: a deserted quay, vast, empty, and disused grain
warehouses (now remarkable only as the largest brick buildings in
Europe), and a silent river. There tomorrow and on Saturday his company
stages its latest production, Stormy Waters. It is a continuation of the
themes he explored with Test Department at St Rollox engine works during
1990 with Second Coming.
That production made the most of its post-industrial site and it was
expected that Stormy Waters -- originally scheduled to be the closing
spectacular of this year's Mayfest -- would focus on the heritage of the
River Clyde, by using the water as a part of the stage for the event.
In fact it has little role to play.
True, the south side of the river at this point does boast the
Kvaerner Govan shipyard where a massive Royal Navy contract is being
completed. Welders, lighting, and dancing cranes will form the backdrop
to the proceedings, but as Farquhar points out, the few ships still
built on the Clyde add little vibrance to the river. They are completed,
launched, and emigrate like so many before them.
''I wanted to use the river, but there is no life there -- and that's
the history of Glasgow. There are reflections, but no traffic. It simply
doesn't exist in the life of the city and that won't change in our
lifetime.''
The changes that Stormy Waters does document are ones that have
happened during that timespan. They are changes in society and (linked)
changes in technology. We are still choking on the former and the latter
-- as Stormy Waters may illustrate -- takes the breath away.
One of the publicity lines for the show boasts: ''Artists
participating in the performance will beam images to Glasgow the
equivalent distance of three times the circumference of the world.''
What this means is a ground-breaking use of computer technology that
uses the Internet to link up participants in countries including
Pakistan, Israel, Australia, the US, Zimbabwe, and the Netherlands.
Their images are manipulated and transmitted using new technology
developed for the project by deadly commercial rivals IBM and Sun
Microsystems. The images are routed through the University of Glasgow
and beamed by Scottish Telecom to the site from its famous spire.
The practical involvement of that landmark is significant. Along with
the City Chambers, Glasgow Cathedral, and other well-known buildings, it
is one of the images that people around the world have been manipulating
to make their art.
For Farquhar they are ''the key Victorian powerhouses''. Structures we
are all too used to.
''What surrounds us is solid civic Victoriana. At that time Britain
was at the head of an empire, with strong class and work hierarchies
still in place. Now the buildings are still in place but they are just a
facade -- what they house is the breakdown of old orders.
''Royalty has lost its moral certainty and Government the respect it
needs to govern. Conventional Christianity is at an all-time low and not
answering people's spiritual needs. Work structures have been atomised
so that there is no certainty, and people may have three or four jobs in
their lifetime.
''People can be utterly exploited -- but there is freedom for those
with the money, education, and wit to make things work for themselves.
We are trying to explore those changes in this show.''
As well as the Internet images, Stormy Waters will include live music
from three bands at the forefront of the use of technology --
Underworld, Autechre, and Plaid -- and the Sativa Drummers, whose
instruments are rather more straightforward. Narration is by Ronald
Fraser Munro and 20 performers are being choreographed by Farquhar and
actor Tam Dean Burn.
Farquhar likens the production to a Richard Rogers building, where all
the service pipes and ducting are on the outside.
''On a normal show the technology is hidden, here you will see
everything. At times the technicians are performers, at times the other
way round. The show will be built in front of your eyes, it will
collapse, and then we'll review what's left.''
Farquhar insists the time is ripe for a reception for his or anyone
else's ideas, as the pillars of the establishment and the old language
of socialist struggle become weaker.
''What artists can do is help people to see things in a different way.
There is no security of the arts, you are only as good as your next
idea. We have to get in there in times of flux.''
The result of up to 40 artists worldwide ''getting in there''
(alongside the other 200 people involved globally) will be broadcast
live on the Internet (at http://www.demon.co.uk/stormy-waters/) and
recorded for future presentation by the NVA organisation.
A one-off artwork for Glasgow's new Gallery Of Modern Art is one
likely use, a touring interactive show/exhibit for schools and community
centres (part funded by the National Lottery) is another.
The director of this technological extravaganza admits to having been
a Luddite about computers until two years ago, and promises a
performance this weekend that will work for people who are not into
technology. But he likens the power of the Internet to that of
Greenpeace.
''It functions as a voluntary network. For two nights only we will be
a world broadcasting company. A small arts company on the Western
fringes of Europe will be as big as Sky.''
Stormy Waters is at Meadowside Granary, Glasgow at 9.30pm tomorrow and
Saturday.

SOARING paper prices and acquisitions combined to more than double
pre-tax profits at David S Smith last year but it is still looking for
further growth, albeit at a slower rate.
In the year to April, profits leapt 136% to #99.7m on turnover up 31%
to #1029m.
However, the City is more interested in seeing whether the
long-awaited bid from International Paper of the US will materialise.
The dividend total has been raised 21% to 13p with earnings per share
doubling to 50.4p.
The group's packaging and paper business enjoyed record shipments and
profits and its Ashton corrugated packaging operation bought a year ago
is exceeding expectations.
The paper-making operations are expected in the near future to operate
at almost full capacity, in line with the generally more robust economic
conditions. The Kemsley mill should see output rise from 430,000 tonnes
to about 500,000 tonnes.
One concern is wastepaper market where prices have increased
dramatically in response to supply shortages across Europe and have
attained levels and is described as being ''extremely tense'' although
there were signs that prices may have peaked.

You just have to
cope, even in your darkest moments.
The pressures on me were enormous and unrelenting
George Birrell meets Eileen Calvo-Nimo, an Edinburgh nurse who has
become a beacon of hope for the people of Noya, in Northern Spain
THREATS of assassination and abduction, fears for her family, attacks
on her house -- these events get a circle in Eileen Calvo-Nimo's diary.
Run-of-the-mill incidents such as hate mail through the letterbox,
anonymous phone calls in the early hours of the morning promising
violence, and attempts to kill the family dog merit only stark recording
in blue biro.
But now there is a red-letter day for the courageous former Scots
nurse who led an unceasing war against the drugs barons in Spain. For
now she has won the battle of her life -- against cancer.
After 20 operations in 10 years, specialists at Edinburgh's Western
General Hospital have given her the all-clear. And during this interview
the brave 45-year-old mother of three, whose life story is to be made
into a film, brushed aside tears and said: ''If these evil men can't get
me what chance has cancer?''
In the last year alone Calvo-Nimo has had three operations to tackle
growths in her throat, breast, and spine. Now the woman, celebrated
throughout Spain as La Escocesa, (The Scotswoman) and renowned because
of the hope she has given to thousands of mothers who thought they had
lost their children to the country's burgeoning drugs trade, is proving
a new inspiration.
''I have no doubt my illness was brought on by the stress I have been
under and have had to bottle up over the years.
''Not that I am complaining. I did what I had to do. But when it
involves being frightened for your very life, or your family's, then it
takes a toll on your health. I was determined not to succumb -- that
would have just meant another victim for the traffickers. I wouldn't
give them that satisfaction.''
In fact, Edinburgh-born Calvo-Nimo has given them no satisfaction
since shortly after she arrived in the unspoilt fishing port of Noya in
Galicia, North-west Spain, in the early 1980s with her merchant seaman
husband, Perry, who now trades in marble -- her two small children,
Julie, now 23, and Paul, 27, from her first marriage.
Within a year she became pregnant. ''At first everything was
marvellous. Quite a little paradise.''
But unknown to her Colombian drug lords anxious to export cocaine and
heroin into mainland Europe chose this slumbering corner of Spain as
their gateway and turned the village into an underworld of addicts,
dealers and corruption.
She witnessed the steady transformation of the village with the
building of sumptuous mansion-style houses and the appearance of Porches
and top-of-the-range BMWs on the streets at the same time as the debris
of the drug culture spilled into its medieval alleyways. By 1990 there
were three Aids victims in the population of 15,000, three years later
there were 453.
In the face of alleged indifference from the central authorities in
Madrid, Calvo-Nimo, along with the local mayor, Dr Pastor Alfonso --
later to be ousted for his stand against corruption -- took matters into
their own hands. After all 50% of Europe's hard drugs were passing
through the area.
They discovered how the drugs were being landed, often by using the
innumerable mussel beds around the coast -- and the routes by which they
were being transported to the rest of Europe. With this information --
and the names of local drug barons -- she flew frequently to London for
talks with Scotland Yard and also the American Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) in Miami. Networking brought information on ships carrying the
drugs, and where they were being stored in England, Holland and Belgium.
As a result there were a number of ''busts'' off the Spanish coast, and
store houses in southern England and on the Continent were raided.
Her campaign had a mixed reception. Poor families who were benefiting
from the drugs trade branded her an interfering foreigner. Others would
stop her in the street and kiss her hand. Her husband supported her all
the way. ''Of course we were worried for her safety and at one time we
were all under such grave personal risk that we were given
round-the-clock police protection,'' he said.
''But she has always made the point which cannot be answered. What
would happen if our children were sucked into the drugs culture. Would
we be able to live with ourselves if we did nothing now? We are all
proud of her; how she has learned Spanish on her own, and now can argue
with anyone in authority in their own language. She is very special,
warm, and caring -- but tough and determined.
''When she was ill she never complained -- until very recently. She
was always houseproud, made the lunch, dinner, did the washing, and
still found time to visit Aids' victims, set up activities for them,
chair meetings, fly all over the world. Suddenly she did not want to do
anything. She was paying the price for her enormous energy and what she
suffered for us all. Now she has come through her illness. I don't know
how inspiring she is for others but she certainly inspires us.''
Calvo-Nimo is more sanguine. ''It all has a corrosive effect on you.
How do you explain to your children that what they are suffering, that
the changes in their lives, the demons they fear, have all been brought
on solely by their mother's activities?
''What sticks in my mind is my daughter Julie saying to me one day:
'Why are you doing all this?' I told her it was for the mothers and the
children whose lives had been devastated by drugs. She turned to me,
tears streaming down her cheeks and said 'But what about us? You are our
mum. Mums should look after their own children first. Who is looking out
for us?' That really got me.''
The next day the traffickers, unable to get to the family, shot their
dog, Tosca. ''I rushed him to the vet and although I stemmed the wound
his blood was all over my clothes. I had never seen so much blood. It
made me think of my own children's blood. It was horrific.
''But he survived. We nursed him, but a few weeks later when he
wandered off again on his own somebody stabbed him with a knife,
fortunately that person was disturbed and the wound was not fatal. Tosca
became a symbol for me, a survivor, but I could not get the thought out
of my head: what if these ghastly things had been done to one of my
children? How could I cope then?
''But you just have to cope, even in your darkest moments and I've had
lots of these. The pressures on me were enormous and unrelenting, but
you have to hide them, keep them to yourself if you are to have any
family life.
''I knew it was affecting my health though. At times I became
listless, I had to galvanise myself to do even the simplest thing around
the house. Then the doctors discovered I had growths in my body and I
shuttled between hospitals in Spain and Scotland for operations. Every
time I underwent an operation I was full of hope, but a few months later
another growth would appear in another place. I was on a treadmill. They
kept opening me up and I thought it would never end.''
She reached her personal nadir last year after her friend, Barbara
Grigor, the award-winning, independent Scottish documentary-producer who
had a holiday home in the same region, fell victim to cancer. Her fight
was brave and cheerful, but the cancer was too far advanced. Grigor's
death was quickly followed by that of Calvo-Nimo's own mother.
''I had just undergone another operation when these two tragedies
occurred. It was difficult enough trying to come to terms with these
deaths when an exploratory examination by Spanish doctors discovered
more new growths. I couldn't believe it. Here were people I loved who
had died -- I was convinced I was next.
''For weeks I just would not move out of the house, I just stayed in
bed pulling the duvet over my head, blocking out the world. I just did
not want to know anyone, not even my family.
''I had an appointment with one of the top specialists in the world in
Edinburgh, and for the first time in my life I almost gave up, deciding
not to see him. If I was going to die I would do so in my own home with
my family around me. Fortunately they persuaded me to pull myself
together and make the trip.''
Local women, many of whom were mothers she had counselled in their
moments of despair prayed and lit candles for her.
The doctors in Edinburgh confirmed that there were more growths -- on
the spine where they had operated before, first removing one of her ribs
to gain access.
''But the test proved that these growths were benign. I had nothing to
worry about. They were amazed at the recovery I had made, and as far as
they were concerned it had cleared up. I was told to stop fretting, and
get on with my life. No chemotherapy, no laser treatment, no operations.
It was my greatest day. I felt like a woman again.''
The treatment has, however, taken its toll. She is no longer the
petite seven-stone redhead who was wooed and won by a dashing Spaniard,
her figure is matronly, the face puffy from drug therapy, and she has
put on weight.
But back in her white-washed hacienda-style home the reprieve has
revitalised her spirit. She will renew her presidency of Mencer (New
Dawn) the social rehabilitation group for drug addicts. Her nursing
training at Bangour Hospital, just outside Edinburgh, and at John
Hopkins Hospital in New York, gave her an understanding of people's
suffering which she has used to good effect. This week she will again
embark on counselling and accompanying addicts to Aids tests.
''Narco traffickers have penetrated every level of the community from
schools to police,'' she said. ''For poor people to be faced with the
prospect of such wealth is an enormous temptation. Our campaign has to
go on.''
But she will scale down her onerous duties. Such was her fame that
when several local seaman were arrested and held in Mozambique a few
years ago, she was approached by the authorities to fly to the African
state to act as a go-between. The men were eventually released, and she
returned to a heroine's welcome.
She also considered changing her nationality, in a bid to stand for
mayor of the village to continue the fight or even for the Cortes on
behalf of the New Alternative Galicia party. ''But when I spoke to the
British authorities in Spain they were quite blunt with me. They said my
high profile and my British passport were probably what saved my life,
as the Spanish government would be embarrassed if anything untoward
happened to me.''
Hollywood moguls are already scripting a film of her life, set to star
Jane Fonda and Charles Bronson in the roles of Calvo-Nimo and Dr
Alfonso. ''I don't know what role my illness will play in such a film,
because I don't want anyone to make out I am some kind of superwoman,
because I am definitely not.''
It is a modesty which is not widely shared. When the Italian judge
Falconi was killed by the Mafia for attempting to end its drugs
industry, his daughter came to Noya to visit Calvo-Nimo. The
''supergrass'' Manolo whose evidence was crucial in the recent Madrid
trial involving six leading local drugs barons, refused to speak to
anyone other than Calvo-Nimo. ''She is the only one I can trust,'' he
said.
I went with her when she visited a local family whose six children in
their teens and early twenties all suffer from Aids. The eldest, a
scraggy young man whose 14-stone frame had been ravaged by the disease,
and now weighed less than five stones was slumped in bed but had just
lit up a cigarette. ''What have I told you,'' she said, gently scolding
him. ''Stop smoking, it damages your health.''
He gave her a broad smile and immediately stubbed it out, and she
spent half an hour talking to him. A week later he died. The mother was
too poor to pay for the funeral; Calvo-Nimo did.
The mother said to me: ''She is a saint. It is God who has sent her to
us to help. It is He who has helped her.''

THE QUESTION of whether it is possible to have economic development
while having a regard for the environment is one which has become more
pressing as previously closed countries open their doors to foreign
investors. I think it is possible to combine the two but there is a
danger that some countries will take short cuts with environmental
protection, just as they have with health and safety in the workplace,
in the rush to acquire the consumer goods and standard of living of the
industrialised West.
However there are those who believe that it is impossible to steer
such a middle ground. Terry Barker, a senior research officer in the
Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge University, believes global
and national growth in gross domestic product is set on an unsustainable
course, wrecking and degrading the natural environment.
concern for the environment, like being vegetarian, is a luxury only
those in the pampered West can afford. Indeed economic research shows
that the extent to which growth is linked to environmental degradation
is highly dependent on levels of income. While environmental quality
appears to deteriorate in the early stages of economic development, at
higher levels of per capita income improvements are evident.
The turning point appears to vary according to the nature of the
pollution, with those affecting health of most concern. Indeed many
parts of the industrialised West are still dragging their feet over
implementing actions to stem the threat posed by slower and more
indirect pollutants, such as those which arise from carbon dioxide
emissions.
It may be that a vociferous middle class has to emerge before
''green'' issues are brought to the attention of the ruling politicians.
However, we only have one planet and what damage is done is cumulative
and will inevitably be a legacy for future generations. Like defence
spending, which is largely carried out on a precautionary principle to
deter would-be aggressors, spending to try to reduce environmental
problems such as global warming can also be viewed as a necessary
precaution because of its unknown consequences.
Indeed the ideal would be for all business managers automatically to
integrate environmental concerns into their normal business practice.
Some of our larger companies already do this, recognising that the
environment, along with the community, is an integral part of business.
Arguably there has never been as many world-wide investment
opportunities. Central and Eastern Europe, China, India, South Africa,
and the ''Tiger'' economies of southeast Asia are all keen to attract
foreign capital. While these emerging markets are able to offer a ready
pool of cheap labour they look to the industrialised nations to provide
technical expertise and added value products and services.
Many of the leading companies in Britain, the US, Germany, and France
are beating a path to these virgin territories. Defence companies such
as GEC and British Aerospace are thick on the ground. Given the rundown
of the Western military machine following the easing of East-West
hostilities it is not surprising that aerospace companies will seek new
markets.
But these are not the only companies interested in trading further
afield. Consumer groups such as Unilever and Cadbury and the privatised
utilities have all been keen to expand their overseas activities.
Companies such as these have a duty and responsibility to export, along
with their goods and services, the best standards of manufacturing and
environmental responsibility. This appears to be in the best interests
of everyone in the long term.
In his paper entitled The Economics of Sustainable Growth, economist
Ian Goldin argues that investments in maintenance of our planet in the
short term are likely to lead to barely significant declines in income
growth, under 1%, but in the long term to facilitate more rapid and
globally equitable development. It is the responsibility of the citizens
of the West to be vigilant and ensure that companies are not able to get
away with practices that would at best be frowned on at home.
Trade liberalistion does not and should not mean that emerging markets
repeat the mistakes of the West when it comes to environmental
pollution. To the extent that trade or other economic policies may have
an adverse effect on the environment, it is up to governments to
initiate policy changes. Improved minimum standards and government
policies for global co-operation in environmental management are a vital
step to ensuring that the benefits of economic growth may more quickly
and effectively be reflected in an enhanced environment.

Clare Henry tries to penetrate the palaver around a somewhat overblown
exhibition of conceptual artists.
WITH #8000 of Lottery cash under its belt from today, Edinburgh's
Fruitmarket Gallery appears to have gone for pot-luck in its selection
of eight artists -- four from Scotland and four from England -- in a
difficult exhibition.
Three of the artists are topical. Fortysomething, internationalist
Peter Randall-Page has been commissioned (with Ian Hamilton Finlay) to
make public sculpture for Edinburgh's Hunter Square beside the Tron
Kirk, more than half the #100,000 plus budget coming from the Lottery.
Randall-Page's precisely carved and polished marble and granite pods and
fruits will be appreciated by the public who like to see skill and high
standards of technique in art.
Tracy Mackenna is in the news for less pleasant reasons. Commissioned
to make a neon text-piece for the Saatchi Gallery's British Design and
Advertising festival featuring the cream of UK ad-men, her work failed
to arrive on time and left a bare wall above the champagne bottles.
Claire Barclay, 27 and Glasgow-trained, has just won the #14,000
Scottish Arts Council Australia Award which gives her a year in Tasmania
working and travelling. It's a lot of money in anyone's book and seeing
her entirely minimal installation here (two hoops, one orange ball plus
a Loch Ness monster-style leather snake) many will wonder why.
Unfortunately neither the catalogue nor Alan Woods's introductory
article will help you here. In fact the catalogue is quite one of the
most useless I've seen in a long time.
Woods never mentions any of the artists in his impenetrable
pseudo-intellectualised ramblings. The problem is compounded by several
pages of anagrams and dictionary definitions. The quotes from the Sufi
glossary are pretentious; so too, many of the artists' quotes. In fact
the whole thing is too clever by half. The notion of each artist
choosing a piece of text to ''complement or relate to their work''
(rather than the more normal explanation) has inspired them to show off
by plumping for abstruse authors and unintelligible prose.
The visitor is left with no way of knowing what the likes of Barclay,
Paul Kelly or Gerard Williams are aiming for. Williams drapes blue and
white cloth, floor to ceiling, pinned according to a wavy template
similar to the Scottish/English Border. The piece is untitled, and as it
stands looks more like marquee curtaining. Kelly's titles are his best
thing with tiny, arid shelves enobled by names like The Power and The
Glory or Psyche and Cupid.
Trevor Sutton actually uses oil paint, but from a distance it has the
smooth finish of cibachrome photos. Close up his circular surfaces with
their formal geometry are so polished, patinated, and luminescent that
one thinks of old waxed mahogany or oiled oak. I rather liked these; so
too David Connearn's horizontal lines repeated ad infinitum until the
result is like slub silk or woven fabric. His filaments are not thread
but black ink on paper. The best images have wavy edges and
imperfections like a textile square.
Mackenna's missing neon reproduced a wall text already painted on the
Fruitmarket wall in red. Ironically it says ''Salvation lies in planning
and technique.'' It's one of several texts like ''You'll Have to
Assume'' and ''You Have to be Ready for Them'' scattered around the
Fruitmarket. I would have liked to see if the neon improved the concept.
Since she began working in France, that most literary country,
Mackenna has taken to words in a big way, dropping her sculptural
installations of drawn line, sand-blasted glass and suchlike. It's a
mistake. In truth she is not very good with words and her
computer-animated texts, which reproduce single words on a red or blue
background with painful slowness, provide evidence of this. Novelty of
technique does not hide the essential banality of her lists.
In this setting Doug Cocker's two groups of 58 interesting abstract
sculptural shapes carved from sycamore and damson wood take on an almost
Michelangelo-esque quality. Here is an artist who can handle three
dimensions; is full of ideas; has the craftsmanship to make his own work
without subcontracting it out -- and is not full of bullshit.
''Beware an imposter'' warns one Mackenna text. She is right. There
are too many imposters around posing as conceptual artists -- and not
just getting away with it -- but getting paid fat-cat grants to
continue. There are also some very good, bright, and interesting
conceptualists. Sadly few of them are here.

Genetic faults which cause thromboses are common. ANN SHAW describes
the dangers and treatments
A SILENT problem with no symptoms is more common than many people,
including doctors, realise, according to Dr Isobel Walker, consultant
haematologist in charge of the weekly Thrombophilia Clinic at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary.
''There is increasing evidence that young women who develop blood
clots either spontaneously or as a result of taking the (contraceptive)
Pill have a genetic default in their blood-clotting system,'' she says.
The first evidence of an inherited tendency for thrombosis in the
family is when someone has a blood clot, especially if the person
happens to be aged below 45. Such genetic defects can be transmitted by
both men and women, and the severity of the defect varies.
''These so-called thrombophilic defects are more common than many
people, including many doctors, realise,'' Dr Walker says.
For this reason, once a person has been identified with a faulty gene,
screening of all family members is important so that they can be warned
and given careful advice and counselling to minimise their risk of also
developing thrombosis.
If they are aware that they have the abnormality then in the event of
requiring surgery, having an accident, or planning a pregnancy, they can
inform doctors about it and be placed on the necessary medication.
So, what's the cause? ''Well, we have a set of proteins which make the
blood clot and another set of proteins that are natural anti-coagulants.
But in people with a deficiency, the level of the second type of protein
is too low to be effective,'' says Dr Walker.
While it may be enough to protect them on a day-to-day basis it's not
enough to safeguard them against something major like pregnancy or the
Pill.
Despite extensive use of oral contraceptives in today's society, Dr
Walker says there are not necessarily more people suffering from blood
clots. ''What is happening is that today doctors are more aware of the
condition and will treat it. Before it went unrecognised and untreated.
''Now if a woman gets a clot after childbirth she is immediately
screened to see if she is deficient in the necessary protein and given
treatment.''
Clotting problems usually start in the late teens or early twenties.
As this is the most common age for women to begin using the Pill,
research is trying to establish the exact relationship between it and
the faulty gene.
The genetic defect is easier to control in boys than girls because
they are at less risk: after all they don't get pregnant nor do they
take the Pill, both known triggers.
What can you do if you know you are at risk? Changes to lifestyle are
important -- a reasonable amount of physical exercise, along with a
healthy diet, and moderate drinking habits are essential.
It must be emphasised, though, that not all families who have the
defects run into problems. For people aged above 70 years, testing is
recommended if blood clots form after minor falls and knocks as this is
not usual.
The Glasgow Royal Infirmary is believed to be the only hospital in
Scotland running a weekly clinic for those at risk of thrombosis, though
a number of other hospitals operate regular Thrombophilia clinics.
Gene therapy may offer the solution eventually but for the time being
close monitoring and drugs will keep the blood flowing freely.
Karen: A case history
* KAREN Smith developed a blood clot at 22 years of age, after the
birth of her son David. ''I had no idea anything was wrong until nine
weeks after the birth,'' says the now 30-year-old mother from
Cumbernauld.
''I was making the beds one morning and I had this dreadful pain in my
chest. I couldn't breathe. It went on for three days before I went to
the doctor. Then I was admitted as an emergency into Monklands General
Hospital.''
But it was several days before doctors finally diagnosed thrombosis, a
relatively rare condition for a woman so young. It appears to be
triggered by the Pill in susceptible individuals.
Smith was put on Warfarin, a blood-thinning drug, and referred to the
Thrombophilia Clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She was found to be
suffering from a genetic blood-clotting defect. Subsequent screening of
close relatives revealed her father was a borderline case too.
After 12 months of treatment, she was taken off all drugs as it
appeared her condition had been successfully controlled. Nevertheless,
when she started her second pregnancy some years later she was put back
on another blood-thinning drug, this time Heparin, which does not cross
the placenta and affect the baby, but has to be injected daily.
The pregnancy and birth went normally and in due course she was again
taken off all drugs.
But her freedom from them only lasted 18 months. As Smith was doing
the housework one morning the pains started again in her chest. She had
developed another pulmonary embolism. This time she knew the routine.
She rang up the Thrombophilia Clinic and was given an appointment
immediately and put back on Warfarin.
Today she accepts she probably faces a lifetime of drug control, but
it's a small price to pay. She is aware she has to keep a careful watch
on her lifestyle: over-indulgence in food and drink are taboo, along
with weight gain. But she is prepared for such small sacrifices in order
to lead an otherwise normal life.
Without the careful care and monitoring offered by the Thrombophilia
Clinic, she could easily have become another statistic: a young woman
who died suddenly from a blood clot.

STANLEY EVELING's two-hander, first seen at the Traverse in 1969 and
later a West End hit, is about a middle-aged novelist and a 20-year-old
acolyte and the relationship they develop courtesy of the Royal Mail.
Built around a long succession of letters, some sent, many binned, and
a smaller number of actual encounters, some real, some imagined, Dear
Janet Rosenberg, Dear Mr Kooning is an examination of mid-life crisis,
youthful enthusiasm, and the British inability to express desire in
anything but the most clumsy and embarrassing manner.
In a finely modulated production directed by Estelle van Warmelo for
the new Meridian Theatre Company, Sandy Neilson plays Alec Kooning, a
directionless writer, ''more passionate than pastoral'', who becomes
erotically obsessed by the young Janet Rosenberg, played by Marsha
Leishman, whose interests are alternately more cerebral -- she doesn't
find him attractive -- or more professional -- she wants to become a
novelist herself.
Eveling excels at big, articulate, tightly-written speeches -- a
talent indulged to the full if not to excess in the epistolary format --
and both actors respond with verve and confidence to the demands they
impose.
But I think Eveling is less in control of the play's structure, which
is perhaps a sign that for all his tricks and double-bluffs, he is not
clear about what his precise theme is. It's not a long play, but
two-thirds of the way through it seems to near a natural conclusion only
to amble on for a while before a last-minute rally.
It's this rambling quality that weakens a generally enjoyable play
that bubbles with ideas, insights, and moments of humour, but never
quite declares its proper purpose.

IT'S familiar territory but oh how he treads it well; gay Irish
performer Graham Norton minces over the trials and tribulations of
thirtysomething singledom -- musing over such staples as shopping for
one in the supermarket -- but manages to inject the usual diatribes with
a fresh and appealing humour. He does so via facial vacillations and
whimsical ponderings that cannot fail to ingratiate, informing us at the
start of the show that he is single but adding with defiant gravitas
that this is from choice. Waiting for the laughter to subside he amends
''my second choice''.
He fuses the comedic strands of Irish rambling and gay confessional
anecdotes to create a refreshing show, which aligns his laid-back style
with an insightful expose of repression of sexuality. It's an approach
which deserves the accolade ''unique''; how nice it is to be surprised.
His appeal is as dependent on his gently-gently persona as it is on his
acidic gags, as evinced in the fact that he gets away with the
occasional bitchy aside to the audience because of the follow-up pangs
of guilt, rushing towards the offended party with demonstrative ''waves
of love'', which are now set to be cultish slogans for all who witnessed
them.
His musings are continually postulated against a light-hearted
deconstruction of the popular seventies television series Charlie's
Angels, an ingenious variation on the usual camp icons of Judy Garland
and Doris Day --Sabrina was obviously the brainy one because she didn't
expose any cleavage. But while the pastiche is inventive, it is an
unnecessary framework for Norton's humour. His hyper-endearing
performance has no need of gimmicks.

Spiritual healing is helping patients across the UK cope with chronic
pain. JUDY MACKIE speaks to healer Stan Gerard about his gift and the
relief it has provided
STAN Gerard discovered his remarkable gift nine years ago, when he
accidentally cured his wife's back problems. Since then he has used it
to bring relief to hundreds of people suffering from a variety of
illnesses and complaints.
Gerard, 51, is one of 300 spiritual healers operating in Scotland, as
part of the NFSH (National Federation of Spiritual Healers) network.
Based at the Healing Centre, at the Total Health Centre in Aberdeen, he
and five colleagues treat an average of 54 people per month, 88% of whom
claimed in a recent survey to have benefited from the experience.
The gentle-spoken civil engineer makes no claims to be special. The
ability to conduct spiritual healing is latent in all of us, he
believes. It's simply a question of whether we want to discover and
develop it. His own discovery was as much a surprise to him as to his
wife, Sheila, when, at a week-long healing workshop in Manchester, his
powers were revealed during a demonstration.
''Sheila is a nurse and at the time had recurring back problems.
During the demonstration, I had to stand behind her with my fingertips
on her shoulders and when it was over, she turned to me and there were
tears streaming down her face. She told me she felt as if every bone in
her spine had been manipulated, and when she got up, her back pain had
gone.
Gerard's subsequent successes have been more quietly dramatic -- some
patients suffering chronic conditions such as arthritis or cerebral
palsy are not completely cured, but claim the pain relief and inner
peace brought about by healing sessions helps them to cope.
Linda Forrest, 47, from Aberdeen, has suffered from rheumatoid
arthritis for 10 years and until recently, on bad days, could hardly
walk up the stairs. For the past nine months she has been visiting
Gerard weekly, and claims her condition has stabilised. She suffers far
less pain and can now run upstairs. Even her sceptical husband has had
to admit the treatment has made a difference.
'' Forrest is a member of the Spritualist Church and believes Gerard's
powers are a gift from the spirit world. Gerard is quick to point out
that the NFSH is not associated with any religion and its patients' own
beliefs do not affect the healing process. However, healers generally
recognise their gift comes from a divine source, he says.
Another patient, 37-year-old Mandy Cowe, from Kennethmont, in
Grampian, is not concerned about the whys and wherefores of Gerard's
powers. All she knows is that her four visits have stabilised her
chronic asthma.
''I've suffered from asthma since childhood and it has sometimes been
so bad I have been in intensive care. During the past two years, it
became worse than ever and in April I decided to give spiritual healing
a go. Amazingly, my condition has improved and although I still carry my
inhaler as a precaution I no longer need it -- and up to now I've never
been able to do without it.''
During a healing session, Cowe often sees colours behind her closed
eyelids and feels heat on her chest, although Gerard is standing behind
her with his fingertips on her shoulders.
The process -- often described as the laying on of hands -- in fact
requires only minimal physical contact, or even none at all. Gerard sees
himself as a ''human transformer'', channelling energy to where the
patient needs it most. While patients may feel heat, he experiences the
energy as an extreme cold at the base of his fingers, which can become
painful, depending on its intensity.
The NFSH explanation of how healing works is simple: ''It re-energises
and relaxes the patients to enable their own natural resources to deal
with illness or injury in the best possible way.'' All that is required
of the patient is an open, receptive mind. As it is seen as a gift,
healing is generally given free, but patients are asked to donate some
money to cover overheads.
Many health professionals now accept the validity of spiritual healing
and in some parts of England it is now even available on the NHS --
Gerard feels there is still a lot of ignorance about it and some
damaging myths yet to be dispelled.
''We don't like to see ourselves as miracle workers, and we're not
faith healers. We're not an alternative to orthodox medicine -- rather,
our role is complementary. Ideally, I would like to see our services
advertised in every GP's surgery, so that patients are given more of a
choice about the treatment available to them.''

* TO keep your bones in good condition you have to go one step further
than diet alone, says the National Osteoporosis Society in its new
leaflet.
You need regular steady exercise to strengthen them and maintain joint
flexibility. It recommends: a brisk walk every day; try walking to the
shops and leave the car at home; use the stairs, not the escalator; take
up cycling or an exercise bike; join a dance class or a local rambling
club.
Diet is important, however, and you should eat plenty of food rich in
calcium such as hard cheese, milk, plain low-fat yoghurt, canned
pilchards, tofu, spinach, broccoli, peas, watercress, carrots, egg and
bread.
Copies of the leaflet, The Inside Story, produced in conjunction with
Boots, can be obtained from the National Osteoporosis Society, PO Box
10, Radstock, Bath BA3 3YB; tel: 01761 471771.

NICK Leeson, the trader blamed for the collapse of Barings, yesterday
described himself as an ordinary citizen who had made ''some very silly
mistakes''.
The admission came in a letter to the Prime Minister as part of Mr
Leeson's campaign to return to Britain.
Mr Leeson's wife Lisa, 26, delivered the letter to No 10 from her
husband, who is being held in jail in Frankfurt.
The 28-year-old former trader at Barings is fighting an attempt to
extradite him to Singapore to face charges connected with the #827m
collapse of the bank in February.
In the letter, written from his prison cell, he said: ''I am a very
ordinary British citizen who made some very silly mistakes. I do not
seek to explain away what I did. It was wrong and I know it.
''But I am British and it was here in Britain that most of the damage
was done. The bank collapsed in Britain. Most of the people hurt by that
collapse are in Britain. I caused it to collapse. I can be charged in
Britain. I will plead guilty.
''On the other hand, if I'm sent to Singapore, where very little
damage was done and few, if any, lost any money, I face a nightmare
trial and nightmare prison conditions.''
Mr Leeson claimed he faced a 14-year sentence in Singapore but this
was dismissed as ''nonsense'' by legal experts there.
Mr Leeson told the Prime Minister he had given the Serious Fraud
Office a 75-page personal statement detailing seven charges which could
be laid against him. He guaranteed he would admit the charges and there
would be no ''legal tricks to get me off them''.
He added: ''I also indicated that I would not be seeking either to
exonerate myself or incriminate others in my actions -- although what I
reveal could well indicate stupidity on the part of others.''
Mrs Leeson, who will visit her husband today, said: ''I am hopeful the
Prime Minister will help us get Nick back. Nick has said he is willing
to go to prison if needs be.''
The letter was handed to Downing Street following the publication on
Tuesday of the Board of Banking Supervision's report into the Barings
collapse.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke told the Commons that the report's main
findings were that the losses were incurred by Mr Leeson's trading
activities and that the true position was not noticed earlier because of
serious failures of controls and managerial confusion within the Barings
group.

THE National Lottery has come to the aid of a tapestry project in
Edinburgh which was scrapped four years ago by the Government.
It will be announced today that Lottery money has been made available
for the Dovecot Tapestry Company to weave a tapestry for the new British
Library in London, due to open in 1997.
Costing around #200,000, it will be based on Kitaj's painting If Not,
Not. The painting belongs to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern
Art.
The tapestry, seven metres square, will provide a memorial to the
Marquis of Bute, who died almost exactly two years ago. He was chairman
of Dovecot Tapestry, which his grandfather founded.
The Bute family havemade generous contributions towards the tapestry
fund.
The project was first announced in 1989 but the Government cut its
library art funding in 1991 and all the art projects were scrapped.

A SCOTTISH Tory yesterday urged a bigger say for local councils in the
distribution of European regional aid, and cited the Scottish Office as
an example of the way forward.
Edinburgh councillor, Mr Brian Meek, today will become the first
Scottish member of the European Union's Committee of the Regions to
present a formal opinion to the community's parliament and council.
His remarks came after last month's strong criticism of the British
Government by Opposition Euro-MPs, including Mr Hugh McMahon
(Strathclyde West), who accused UK Ministries of ''robbing'' the regions
by holding European aid payments from Brussels in a bank account and
keeping the interest.
Mr Meek's report -- produced jointly with a Danish member of the
committee, Mr Bent Hansen -- states that partnership agreements between
local councils, national governments, and the Commission in Brussels
need to be improved.
''The EU's regional policy is extremely important in reducing regional
disparities and in the promotion of economic and social cohesion,'' Mr
Meek argued.
He said Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was engaged in dialogue
with local government, and the Scottish Office was the only department
in the UK which included an established regional planning team of local
representatives. ''This principle should be extended to the whole of the
UK. Elected members should be asked how this money is used,'' he said.

Professor Alan Alexander remembers Rose Kerrigan, a life-long radical
ROSE Kerrigan, who died at the age of 92 this week, was both typical
and atypical of Jewish immigrants who became a part of Glasgow life in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Rose Klasko was born in Dublin, where her parents had settled as
refugees from Vilnius in Lithuania before their subsequent move to
Glasgow. She came from a family of five children, itself part of a large
extended family which has now become a mini-Diaspora, both by emigration
and by ''marrying out'', though she maintained contact with her cousins
and second cousins, in Glasgow and abroad, long after she moved to
London.
As with many immigrant Jews, both then and in the later exodus from
Nazi Germany, religious and social persecution was a formative influence
that pushed her into radical politics whose unifying thread was a fierce
opposition to prejudice, unfairness, and exploitation.
The timing of her arrival in Glasgow was perfect, for it allowed her,
in her formative years, to hear the great figures of Red Clydeside, both
on the soapbox at Glasgow Green, and at meetings of the Socialist Sunday
School. James Maxton, John MacLean, Ramsay MacDonald, Manny Shinwell,
and many others provided intellectual support for a radicalism that
began at home.
She was typical in her involvement in the socialist and trade union
movements, to which she was introduced through the influence of her
father, an active member of the Glasgow Jewish Workers' Circle. She
stood out in that she was a woman in what was predominantly a man's
world.
Her radicalism never waned. She joined the Communist Party of Great
Britain at its formation in 1921 and remained a member until it
collapsed with the Berlin Wall. Her radicalism extended to issues that
were not exclusively left wing, although she saw left-wing politics and
trade unionism as a powerful vehicle for their advancement.
In particular, she fought continuously for women's rights long before
they became a mainstream political issue and with little concern for the
institutional male chauvinism that for so long dominated the industrial
wing of the British Labour movement. She loved to describe how, in the
1920s, she scandalised Glasgow's only birth-control clinic by seeking
contraceptive advice before she had any children.
Characteristically, her explanation was economic: she and her husband
would be unable to manage financially if they had children too soon. But
there was politics in it too, for she was an early proponent of the link
between women's rights, and their ability to regulate the reproductive
process.
In 1926 she married Peter Kerrigan, a Communist and an engineering
worker who was one of the Glasgow leaders of that year's General Strike.
Peter went on to become industrial organiser for the Communist Party and
it is a measure of Rose's personality and strength of character that
no-one ever regarded her as anything other than an independent political
force, pursuing her own causes with a vitality and determination that
scarcely needed the organisational base of a political party.
From the Communist Party she became active in the earliest days of the
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and in her retirement she was an active
campaigner for the rights of old-age pensioners, attending meetings in
London until shortly before her death.
Rose Kerrigan was one of the last links to a powerful Jewish immigrant
influence on radical politics on Clydeside. As with many immigrant
communities, the radicalism of Glasgow's Jews has weakened as each
succeeding generation has achieved greater material prosperity and
social acceptance. She would have found that a fair explanation, but a
poor reason for the change.
* Professor Alan Alexander is Professor in the Department of Local and
Public Management at Strathclyde Business School.

THE Princess Royal braved showers, high winds -- and a troublesome
wasp -- on Cumbrae yesterday.
The princess visited the island's marine biological station and was
met by its director, Professor John Davenport, who explained the work of
the station in teaching, research, and specimen collection.
More than 1200 students a year use the station for study, research,
and examination of marine specimens collected from the Firth of Clyde.
A wasp showed little respect for the royal personage as it followed
her across the courtyard. With a royal wave, the errant insect was
dispatched and the princess continued with her tour.
Later, she visited the Cathedral of the Isles in Millport, said to be
the smallest in Europe, where she unveiled a plaque to commemorate the
recommissioning of the bells, which were repaired in London.
Earlier, she opened the Princess Royal Trust Centre in Glasgow's
Tollcross Road, run by Glasgow East End Community Carers.
Volunteers help the centre's five staff to offer help for hundreds of
carers, with services such as respite care, advice, and support.
Meanwhile, the Queen is to attend for the first time a full service in
a Roman Catholic church, it emerged yesterday.
She has been invited by Cardinal Basil Hume to an ecumenical service
at Westminster Cathedral on November 30 to mark the cathedral's 100th
anniversary. The Vespers service will include hymns and prayers but
there will be no Mass.

<HEADLINE>Damage to Church 'incalculable'.  Dean cleared of adultery with verger</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977305788</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
The Dean of Lincoln, cleared of having an adulterous affair with a
former verger, said last night the Church had been ''incalculably''
damaged by the case.
The Very Rev Brandon Jackson, 60, said he believed former verger
Verity Freestone had been ''manipulated'' to bring the action. He could
not say how the rare consistory court proceedings had affected his
relationship with the Bishop of Lincoln.
Dean Jackson was cleared of ''conduct unbecoming the office and work
of a clerk on holy orders'' by participating in sexual acts with Miss
Freestone, now 32.
Miss Freestone, in court throughout the three-day hearing, put her
hand to her mouth in apparent shock as the verdicts were announced.
The dean, the most senior clergyman in many years to face a consistory
court, had strongly denied the charges and was cleared by four
assessors.
He smiled broadly as he walked from the building, a short distance
from Lincoln Cathedral, holding his wife Mary's hand. Last night, he
admitted there were times when he felt like quitting.
Sitting in his quiet walled garden in the shadow of Lincoln Cathedral,
he said he believed Miss Freestone had been ''manipulated'' by others to
bring the case. He thought the Church had ''learned a lesson'' over what
had happened and the way the case had been brought.
''Here is a woman the bishop had described as pretty hopeless. She
made an allegation and I denied it. It can't make any sense which ever
way you look at it. This will never happen again.
''There is no winner but the Church has been damaged incalculably.''
He said the consistory court was an inappropriate way of dealing with
such allegations.
Of his future relationship with the Bishop of Lincoln, Dean Jackson
said: ''I don't know is the answer. I think we have got to talk. There
has to be a lot of forgiveness, a lot of honesty, and a lot of
admissions on both sides. That will not be easy for the bishop. That
will be easier for me than him.
''We have got to get together. We are both senior churchmen and we are
both sworn to the mission of God. We have got to go forward positively
together. How we do that I don't know.''
The Bishop of Lincoln said in a statement: ''The dean has been
exonerated in relation to the allegations made against him and while I
realise that it will be far from easy after so long and painful a time,
I hope that all concerned will strive to put the past behind them and to
look and work towards the future.
''In the first instance, I am arranging to see the dean so that I can
discuss with him how this can best be achieved.''
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, welcomed the decision
and said he had been praying for the dean and his family.
Mr Jackson's wife, Mary, spoke of her relief when the verdict finally
came after 18 months stress and strain for her, her husband, and their
children Tim, 36, Robert, 34, and Jane, 31.
She said of her husband: ''I never had any doubts in him.''
Miss Freestone, now a community carer, had claimed the dean tried but
failed to have intercourse with her, indulging in oral sex instead, at
her home in Croft Street, Lincoln, on October 19, 1993, and again at the
deanery on November 30 that year.
She claimed the marathon-running dean had arrived once to visit her
with a bottle of wine.
The dean, while accepting that he saw her at those locations on those
occasions, strongly denied any sexual impropriety, saying he wanted to
listen to her problems and lend sympathetic support.
If he had been found guilty, he could have been dismissed from the
post -- and defrocked if any appeal had failed.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie lifts the lid on open government, Swedish-style
THE current debate about what politicians and Government Ministers
should or should not reveal about themselves simply could not happen in
Sweden, which claims the oldest free press in the world. Its Freedom of
the Press Act is dated 1766, and it is part of the Swedish Constitution
which can only be changed after two decisions by Parliament, with an
election in between.
As a result Swedish journalists find it hard to fathom the British
reluctance to open Government files. ''In Sweden, secret information is
the exception,'' one Stockholm journalist said, ''the aim is to put it
into the public domain unless, it has to be secret.''
That, of course, depends on your definition of ''has to be secret,''
and for documents that relate to defence and foreign affairs, discretion
must be used. But Sweden's tendency to go public is very wide. It is
based on the idea of public opinion as a separate and important entity,
a voice that should take part in shaping policy, with a background of
knowing how it works.
More often than not, the watchdog role is left to the press, on behalf
of the public.
The Swedish Act divides information into two categories -- national
security and foreign affairs on the one hand, and matters affecting an
individual's privacy on the other. Top secrecy applies to civil servants
dealing with national security and military personnel, who may not
reveal military secrets. But in this area, a newspaper could be charged
only if what it printed amounted to espionage.
Foreign affairs also call for some restrictions or the Swedes could
find themselves revealing another country's secrets. In these
circumstances, Foreign Ministry officials sift and check documents
thoroughly to see what can be made public.
As far as individuals are concerned, everyone's social and health
records are protected and must not be disclosed.
Compared with Britain, there is an unusual slant in the more lurid
outpourings of its tabloids. In Sweden, anyone, politicians included, in
the public eye, is fair game for revelations about her or his private
life. However the life of an ordinary member of society is sacrosanct.
Without an individual's consent, no revelations of a sexual, financial
or similar nature can be made.
Journalists are also protected. Far from being sent to prison by a
judge for not revealing their sources, journalists by law are not
allowed to do so, and they can be prosecuted if they do. But it rarely
happens. A journalist could be asked to reveal sources in a criminal
case, but only when the innocence or guilt of the accused depended on
it.
The way in which the Press Act works calls for a good deal of trust
and co-operation with officials. But Sweden, which gave the word
''ombudsman'' to the world is, to an amazing degree, a country of
consensus and openness.
If there are disagreements, they are dealt with by the Press
Ombudsman, currently a former newspaper editor, Per-Arne Jigenius. He
acts as a mediator. But the Act's and his first objective is always to
have a document made public unless the reasons against that are
incontrovertible. The Ombudsman also deals with some 400 cases of
complaints by the public each year.
That indicates what is certainly true, that the Swedish press is not
always whiter than white but, despite that, the system works well, and
many Swedes are simply amazed at goings-on in Britain.

<TEXT>
A MOTHER has won a court battle for custody of her two young daughters
after discovering they had become convinced she did not love them
following a stay abroad with their father.
The girls' father, Mr Robert Cameron, went to the Court of Session in
Edinburgh seeking an order for the return of the children to his home in
France.
However, Lord Hamilton has ruled in a written judgment that the father
has not proved that Rachael,7, and Sasha,5, were habitually resident
there, and also that the French courts should decide custody.
He had claimed that his wife, Fiona, of Ballachraggan Wood, Kildary,
near Invergordon, in Ross-shire, wrongly kept the youngsters after she
took them back to Scotland in April.
The court heard that the couple had left their house in West Kilbride,
Ayrshire, in 1993 to start a new life in France.
Mr Cameron had used money from his father to buy a house in a small
village in the Charente region of western France.
The couple had intended that the substantial property should become a
permanent home for them, their daughters, and their baby son Hamish --
despite strains in their relationship.
Lord Hamilton said: ''Their sojourn in France lasted less than three
weeks.
''The weather was not good and Mr Cameron decided that his wife and
children should be sent back to Scotland.''
Lord Hamilton said that, following the separation, the couple's
relationship steadily deteriorated and by the autumn of last year it had
become increasingly clear that a final separation was inevitable.
Mr Cameron was determined that his daughters should return to France
to live with him.
Lord Hamilton said Mrs Cameron did not wish the girls to go to France
on a permanent basis. However, she was reluctant to see their
relationship with their father damaged.
In December, Mr Cameron and the girls left for France
The girls' mother kept in touch by phone but she became increasingly
concerned. The children were not relaxed during conversations with her.
Mr Cameron returned to England in April to visit his mother and it was
arranged that his wife should visit the children.
''She discovered that the girls were convinced that she did not love
them,'' said Lord Hamilton.
Two days before they were due to return to France with their father,
Mrs Cameron took them north to Scotland.
The girls' father then began court proceedings to try to get the
youngsters sent back.
He maintained that, under a separation agreement, the girls were with
him with the consent of his wife under a long-term arrangement.
However, lawyers for Mrs Cameron argued that the children were going
to live with their father temporarily.
Lord Hamilton said: ''I do not doubt that when the girls left . . .
she believed that they would be back in Scotland with her in the summer
of 1995 and that their long-term future would ultimately be settled at
that time.''
He said the agreement between the couple had been an attempt to ensure
that the girls maintained ''a close and loving relationship'' with both
parents despite their separation.
The judge said the question for him was whether the girls had become
habitually resident in France within the terms of the international
child abduction convention.
Lord Hamilton said that in a case like this, where the girls' stay was
an experimental one, their three-month period in France was not long
enough to meet the required standard.

BANK of England Governor Eddie George brought furious protests from
Labour MPs last night when he dubbed the investigation into the collapse
of Barings bank a ''witchhunt''.
One Labour MP called for an apology over the remarks, in which Mr
George told a Commons committee: ''You want blood.''
Mr George's comments came after he had been giving evidence for two
hours to the Treasury Select Committee, which is inquiring into the
#800m Barings' collapse.
Referring to the job of regulating financial institutions, he told the
committee: ''Actually getting people to do this job is becoming very
difficult.''
Mr George, who was questioned for three hours, asked ''how on earth''
new people could be brought into financial regulation ''when we go
through this kind of procedure every time there's a problem''.
To protests from committee members, he added: ''I understand precisely
that this is the way to improve -- where every time there's a problem,
there's a great investigation, you want blood.''
Labour MP Diane Abbott (Hackney N and Stoke Newington) angrily called
out: ''You are responsible to Parliament.''
To further Labour protests, Mr George insisted: ''I accept this kind
of procedure and I accept that it has to apply a 100% standard.
''But I tell you this -- if you want better regulation, you have got
to take account of the fact that this kind of witchhunt every time
something goes wrong is going to make it very difficult to get the
people to do it.''
Labour's Brian Sedgemore (Hackney South and Shoreditch) told Mr George
that his witchhunt remark appeared to have been directed ''at this
particular inquiry''.
Mr Sedgemore challenged the Governor to say whether it had been
''perhaps an injudicious remark which slipped out, one best not said'',
and asked Mr George whether he would like to apologise.
Mr George replied: ''If it helps you to apologise, to call it a
witchhunt -- I wouldn't actually want you to think that I was addressing
just this kind of inquiry.''

Anne Johnstone finds muted approval for the new Children (Scotland)
Act amid some concerns that it may dilute crucial rights
AFTER seven years of pontificating, agonising, and fiery debate, the
Children (Scotland) Bill finished its last lap in Parliament yesterday
almost unnoticed. With MPs already packing for the summer recess, this
historic piece of legislation, which will change the lives of thousands
of children in Scotland, was waved through without a single dissenting
murmur.
Like the curate's egg, it is good in parts. That, at least, is the
general view. ''A major step forward for Scotland's children and their
families,'' was the verdict of the Consortium for the Children
(Scotland) Bill, an umbrella group of 54 statutory and voluntary
organisations concerned with caring for children in Scotland. At the
same time the consortium says it remains ''deeply concerned'' about
several crucial issues.
By any standards it is a formidable piece of work. With over 100
clauses in five schedules, it has been the subject of hundreds of
amendments, introduced by all parties in both Houses. And despite much
public and private wrangling over certain clauses, it is above all a
tribute to consensus politics both in and outside Westminster. Unusually
for such a major piece of legislation, it has from the start enjoyed not
only all-party support but also the backing of nearly all the agencies
involved.
The tentacles of this gargantuan Act, the first major legislation on
the subject in more than 25 years, will reach deep into the public and
private lives of Scotland and her citizens, especially the wee ones:
* The Children's ''Panel'' system is clarified and improved, including
the right to exclude a ''relevant person'' (eg a suspected abuser) so as
to obtain a child's views.
* There are new orders and more exacting criteria to be met before a
child can be taken into care, including a new exclusion order, under
which a suspected abuser can be banned from a child's home. Previously,
it was the child who was removed, so facing the double agony of abuse
and separation.
* Adoption law is rationalised and modernised.
* There is a new statement of parents' responsibilities in raising
their children.
* Terms like ''custody'' and ''access'' are abandoned in favour of the
less divisive concepts of ''residence'' and ''contact''. The aim is to
make it easier for children to maintain contact with both parents in the
event of separation.
For those involved in the fine-tuning of the legislation, its speedy
passage since publication last November must have seemed like a marathon
conducted as a sprint. Ironically this dash for the tape came after
seven years waiting for the race to start. The Scottish Office set up
its Child Care Law Review in 1988.
Its report arrived two years later. By this time England and Wales had
their own Children's Act so the pressure was on for Scotland to come
into line, but events intervened pushing the timetable for the
legislation further and further back.
In 1992 the Scottish Law Commission added its voice to the debate with
its recommendations on family law. Meanwhile there were a number of
childcare reports and inquiries: Lord Clyde's on the Orkney child abuse
affair, Sheriff Kearney's on child care policies in Fife, and the
Skinner Report on residential care. There seemed no point in pressing on
with legislation until their conclusions and recommendations had been
carefully weighed.
Finally, the proposals for changes in childcare were published in a
White Paper in August 1993, and most observers expected a Bill in the
next Queen's Speech. But Scottish local government reorganisation was
now on the agenda and, as Parliament seems incapable of handling two
major pieces of Scottish legislation simultaneously, the children's
measure was postponed.
The week before the Children (Scotland) Bill was finally published
last November, more than 60 Scottish organisations with interests in
children, ranging from Strathclyde region to the Scottish Black Workers'
Forum, sent representatives to a meeting convened by the Scottish Child
Law Centre and the pressure group Children in Scotland.
The result was the Consortium for the Children (Scotland) Bill, which
has proved highly effective at focusing public attention on the issues
and pressing for changes. For the past eight months its members have
held numerous press conferences, meetings with the Scottish Office and
briefings for MPs and peers.
In some areas consortium members agreed to disagree. After a fierce
argument involving Scottish Women's Aid and Family Mediation Scotland,
it was decided that individual groups should lobby on their own behalf
on the thorny issue of parental rights for unmarried fathers. But in
most areas a broad measure of agreement gave the consortium vital
lobbying power.
As a result it is largely responsible for several important amendments
to the orginal Bill. These include the extension of exclusion orders for
use in emergency situations, a new duty of local authorities to publish
information about children's services, and an explicit right for a child
to attend a court or children's hearing considering his or her case.
Elsewhere in the Bill various attempts to introduce changes failed.
Yesterday, Fiona Dow of Children in Scotland said four crucial issues
remained.
First, by contrast with previous legislation which placed on local
authorities the duty to promote the welfare of all children, the new Act
will refer only to ''children in need''. Amendments have widened the
definition of this term, but many consider it still too narrow.
The use of the same term in the 1989 Children's Act has opened the
door on widely differing interpretations of their role by different
authorities. ''Social work directors would prefer a more open duty to
provide services rather than having to define a child as 'in need'
first,'' said Mary Hartnoll, Strathclyde's social work director.
Second, despite pressure from Labour, the Act will not limit the
physical punishment of children, as proposed by the Scottish Law
Commission. ''Though we're supporting the Bill, there are issues we want
to come back to in the future and this is one of them,'' said Maria Fyfe
for Labour yesterday.
Third, young people leaving care are left relatively unsupported. The
Act makes local authorities responsible for offering advice and guidance
up to 19 (currently it's 18 years) but given the high level of
homelessless and other problems among this age group, many argued that
the limit should be 21.
''Our greatest fears are for vulnerable-care leavers who get little
from this Act,'' said Alison Cleland of the Scottish Child Law Centre.
Lastly, children's hearings, courts and local authorities are given a
strange-sounding power to ignore children's rights when the public are
deemed ''to be at risk of serious harm''. Critics argue: ''Shouldn't the
children come first?''

A BOARD member of a hospital trust is to be given a warning following
her behaviour when she attempted to leave an industrial tribunal in
Glasgow yesterday while giving evidence.
Mrs Sue Williams, of Greater Glasgow Community and Mental Services NHS
Trust, was giving evidence before the hearing when the outburst took
place.
She had chaired an unsuccessful appeal hearing into the dismissal of
nursing assistant Daniel Martin, of Summerhill Road, Drumchapel,
Glasgow, who was sacked from Gartnavel Royal Hospital.
Mr Martin had allegedly assaulted and shouted and sworn at an elderly
patient, and incorrectly lifted and used a blanket to restrain the
patient. The tribunal heard that Mr Martin went to trial on criminal
charges arising out of the incident, but was cleared on all counts.
While Mrs Williams was being cross-examined by Mr Gerry Sinclair,
representing Mr Martin, on whether procedural errors had taken place in
the case, she became increasingly agitated.
She then stood up in the middle of the cross-examination and, in reply
to a question from the lawyer, said: ''In that case, you are saying I'm
not a credible witness. You are calling me a liar. I will just leave the
room. I am not taking this.''
The tribunal chairman, Mr William Courtney, tried to get Mrs Williams
to sit down and pointed out that the lawyer had a duty on behalf of his
client to ask questions. Mrs Williams replied: ''He's calling into
question my credibility, he's saying I'm a liar,'' and still made to
leave the room.
In an attempt to defuse the heated situation, Mr Sinclair indicated
that he would not be asking any more questions. The hospital's lawyer
tried to get the witness to sit back down.
After Mrs Williams left the room, the tribunal chairman told the
lawyer, representing Greater Glasgow Health Board: ''I wonder if when
next you see your witness that you tell her that we try to make hearings
an informal affair. But no matter how informal they are, they are not
that informal.
''You may wish to tell her that, if she behaves in that way again in
front of a tribunal, she might find herself in trouble.''
The lawyer confirmed to the chairman that she would speak to Mrs
Williams about her conduct.
Mr Martin, giving evidence to the tribunal, said he had worked at
Gartnavel Royal for eight years without any problems and had never had
disciplinary action taken against him.
He said that on the night of the alleged incident, in October 1993, he
had been working a double shift because of a staff shortage.
He totally denied assaulting the geriatric patient and shouting or
swearing at him but he did admit to lifting him incorrectly from a chair
and dressing him in a blanket.
The 45-year-old nursing assistant said that on the night in question
he was one of four staff responsible for a mixed ward of 29 long-term
geriatric patients.
He said the patient involved was well known for continually removing
his clothes and that he had had to dress him again on a number of
occasions.
Mr Martin admitted to being ''agitated'' at the time but said this was
because he seemed to be the only member of staff involved with the
patient.
He added: ''Never at any time in my life have I lifted my hand to a
patient. I've never ever in eight years sworn at any patient.
''My conscience is clear. I lost my job for something I didn't do.''
The hearing continues.

While reports of the Beast of Bodmin were being examined yesterday,
Gavin Bell reveals substantial evidence of mysterious creatures
attacking livestock in the Highlands
There have been so many sightings of big cats that we can't rule out
that something unusual is out there
THE beast came hurtling down a hillside, leapt high over a barbed-wire
fence without breaking stride, and began ripping the guts out of a sheep
carcass.
About 25 yards away, crouched behind a bale of straw, retired
gamekeeper Stanley Windsor levelled his 12-bore shotgun and took careful
aim. With his first shot, the creature screeched and its long tail
arched over its back in shock and pain. The second blast caught it just
behind its front legs, but it managed to stagger out of the field and
disappear under the cover of thick gorse.
Windsor is convinced that the animal he shot on a neighbour's farm
near Banff last week was a species of big cat. He describes it as being
jet black, larger than an alsatian, with small pointed ears, and a tail
thick at the base with a curl at the tip.
While wildlife experts were discounting reports of a similar beast in
the Bodmin area of Cornwall yesterday, the latest incident in Grampian
region was being taken seriously by farmers concerned for livestock.
Tales of strange creatures prowling the Highlands are as old as
recorded history, but a spate of savage attacks on sheep that began last
autumn has alarmed the North-east farming community. In each case, the
carcasses had been devoured -- making the killings different from past
instances of attacks by dogs.
A typical incident was reported at a farm near Huntly in December,
when a sheep was literally torn to pieces. PC Neil Bunning, who was
called to the scene, said: ''It was quite horrific. All that was left
was the backbone, which had been skinned along its length, a few ribs
and its head.''
Farmer Douglas Davidson blamed a cat, bigger than a labrador, that had
been spotted in the area by two neighbours a few weeks before.
About the same time, people claimed to have seen similar beasts
swimming across the River Dee near Banchory, prowling in the countryside
near Turriff, and attacking a domestic cat at Skene. In February, a
professional photographer noticed cattle stampeding in a field near
Forres and was startled to see what appeared to be a large, dun-coloured
cat loping along the side of the field.
Unfortunately, he did not react quickly enough to capture it on film;
which has been a recurring problem with such incidents. Despite all the
reported sightings by sober, serious people, no conclusive evidence has
emerged of fearsome felines stalking the Highlands.
Perhaps Windsor came closest to providing it. Certainly his account
has been the most graphic so far -- because he claims to have seen three
of the creatures in a feeding frenzy.
The retired gamekeeper came to within 50 yards of the creatures when
he went at dawn to stake out the carcass of a savaged sheep on a
friend's farm. ''They were snarling and spitting and kind of growling at
each other as they were feeding, I'd never heard the likes of that noise
before,'' he says.
''It was quite frightening. But as I climbed the wire fence to get
nearer, my denims got stuck and made the fence twang and the beasts ran
off.''
Within five minutes one of them returned, however, and it was this one
he believes he shot with both barrels. ''I was a gamekeeper for 28
years, and I've never seen anything like this before. They were
definitely not dogs or foxes. They were big, black cats and they were
hunting in a pack.''
Windsor believes they were responsible for killing another of his
friend's sheep during the winter. ''It was a big ewe heavily in lamb,''
he recalls. ''There must have been 200 pounds of meat in it. It was
killed during the night and next morning all that was left was the four
hooves and a small piece of skin. Foxes don't feed like that, not in one
night they don't.''
In response to growing public concern, Inspector John Sellar, Grampian
Police's wildlife liaison officer, launched a hunt for the killers along
with experts from the College of Agriculture in Aberdeen, and the
Institute of Terrestrial Ecology near Banchory.
But, like the inquiry in Cornwall, the two-month investigation was
inconclusive.
''We found no evidence of any foreign or unusual species of cats being
involved,'' he says. ''What we found was, in the main, consistent with
attacks by dogs or foxes. Having said that, there have been so many
sightings of big cats that we can't rule out that something unusual is
out there.''
If Inspector Sellar was to make an educated guess at what the
mysterious creatures might be, he would suggest two possibilities --
hybrids of wild and feral cats, or exotic species released by owners
unwilling to meet the legal requirements for keeping them.
''There are certainly hybrid cats in the Highlands, although I would
be very surprised if any of them had attained the proportions of a puma.
There is also the possibility that somebody set a big cat free to avoid
the provisions of the Dangerous Animals Act.''
The legislation, which came into force in the 1970s, set stringent
rules for keeping such animals and taking out third party insurance.
The only recorded case of the kind was in 1980, when a tame puma was
captured in Inverness-shire. It was cared for at the Highland Wildlife
Park in Aviemore until its death in 1985, since when it has been
exhibited at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.
Inspector Sellar regrets that, for the moment, there is little more
the police can do. ''If somebody could tell us in which particular field
in Banffshire we might find a big cat at a certain time tomorrow, we
would be happy to come along with a tranquiliser gun. Failing that, we
can only investigate sightings and incidents as they occur.''
In the meantime, he wishes to reassure the populace that attacks on
humans are highly unlikely. ''Even if there are unusually large cats out
there, there is an abundance of food for them in rabbits, hares, birds,
and so on. And I think we should keep a sense of perspective. We're not
talking about man-eating tigers and grizzly bears wandering around
Grampian region.''
Maybe not, but any sober motorist who sees large cats' eyes veering
from the centre of a Highland road at night is invited to inform the
nearest police station.

<HEADLINE>Tokyo would have used atomic bomb against America, says scientist</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

Tokyo, Wednesday
JAPAN would not have hesitated to use the atomic bomb against US
targets had it produced one during the Second World War, a scientist who
took part in pre-war Tokyo's top-secret nuclear bomb programme said
today.
But Japan would have chosen ''military'' targets like air bases in the
Pacific instead of civilians, Tatsusaburo Suzuki, now a retired physics
professor, told a news conference.
''I heard talk of using it on B-29 bases on Saipan and Tinian,''
Suzuki told the Foreign Correspondent's Club of Japan, ''but there was
no serious discussion since we were far from succeeding in producing
one''.
Contrary to claims by some scholars, Suzuki said Japan was nowhere
near completing an atomic bomb. It had failed to achieve the
breakthrough of producing enriched uranium.
Japan was the only country outside the United States to own a
cyclotron, a device used to split atoms.
Suzuki was asked whether, given his view that Japan intended to use
the atomic bomb, Japan could be regarded as sharing US ''guilt'' over
the weapon.
In reply, Suzuki, now 83 and who retired as dean of the Iwaki Meisei
University earlier this year, only said: ''I saw the terrible effects of
the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.
''It was then that I thought they should never be used again. Before
that, nobody really knew what the atomic bombs could do.''
Suzuki, who was a career military officer and scientist, acknowledged
that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks helped to end the war.
''The Japanese people must thank the late Emperor Hirohito for his
courage in accepting surrender. I'm glad only two bombs were used,''
Suzuki said.
He said the United States had the capacity to drop 15 more atomic
bombs by December 1945 if Japan had refused to accept defeat.
Japan's own atomic programme began in 1940 and involved 50 scientists,
a fraction of the 123,000 people who were employed in the Manhattan
Project.
But all data and records of the project were destroyed by Suzuki and
his colleagues in the last days of the war, and the affair has largely
been forgotten by Japan since the war.
For example, Japan's nuclear project does not figure in history
textbooks, which focus more on the sufferings of Hiroshima, where
140,000 died when the first atomic bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945,
and on Nagasaki, where 70,000 people died three days later. Japan
surrendered on August 15, 1945.--AP.

Rangoon, Wednesday
DISSIDENT Aung San Suu Kyi appeared in public today for the first time
since she was released from house arrest last week.
The official Myanmar TV showed Suu Kyi laying flowers at the Martyrs'
Day ceremony, a national mourning day when Burmese remember her father,
independence hero General Aung Sandozen.
Earlier today, she met journalists and photographers in the garden of
her Rangoon home where the 50-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner spent
her detention.
After asking that all cameras be turned off and no pictures be taken,
Suu Kyi mingled, signing autographs and asking reporters about their
visit.
About 100 foreign reporters, photographers and cameramen drank tea and
ate cakes at the garden party.
One close adviser to Suu Kyi said she held the tea party because ''she
thought most of you would be going home soon''.
Burma's ruling military has had an uneasy relationship with the
foreign media and no reporters were allowed in to the country for
several years after the military suppressed a 1988 democracy
uprising.--Reuter.

AID agencies in Tuzla are working to head off a health epidemic as
more exhausted, traumatised and undernourished refugees arrive in the
town's overcrowded and unsanitary camp.
More than 7000 people from Srebrenica are living on an airstrip just
outside Tuzla with more arriving every day. Many are too shell-shocked
to speak, some are injured, and no-one knows what the future holds.
Speaking from Tuzla last night, Oxfam aid worker John Palmer said
there were very real concerns about a major outbreak of dysentery and
other diseases.
''Their state of health is pretty poor. We are really worried in the
short term of an epidemic spreading amongst the refugees. We are doing a
lot of health care work and we are trying to encourage people to move
away from the camp and into the town.''
News of bereavement has now become a daily occurrence in the camp as
the remnants of Srebrenica's menfolk start to filter into the town.
''Over the last few days it has been quite noticeable that men are
starting to arrive in the camp,'' said Mr Palmer. ''I was talking to a
few and they had walked for six days and six nights to get here from
Srebrenica. They have been through a really, really rough time. They
haven't eaten for a number of days -- they have had to walk several
hundred miles to get to the camp. Some of them were suffering from total
exhaustion, some of them are injured.
''They are bringing good news for some families but they are also
bringing bad news for others. There are lots of women up at the camp who
are very, very upset at the moment.''
With the other ''safe areas'' under increasing threat, Mr Palmer and
the other aid workers are bracing for an even bigger influx of refugees.
''We are expecting more refugees to come in. We will have to build up so
that when they do arrive the infrastructure is in place to handle
them.'' The Tuzla area has already absorbed around 200,000 refugees in
the last two years.
Despite the widespread anger and frustration at the UN's handling of
the crisis, Mr Palmer said aid officials had experienced nothing but
gratitude from the refugees. ''They are really, really grateful and they
have been surprised to find that people in Scotland and England care
about them and are thinking about them.''
As well as basic sanitary needs, Oxfam is distributing nappies and
clothing for mothers and children and trying to keep the youngest
refugees, who remain almost oblivious to the chaos around them, amused.
''These people have been through so much over the last few months. The
women and the older children, you can see it in their faces that they
are worried sick about their fathers, husbands and brothers. On the
other hand, the youngest children are running around and having a great
time. They don't really understand what's happening.''
He added: ''We are safe here as long as the UN stays. If the UN were
to withdraw and the arms embargo to be lifted, the whole place would
just fall into total and absolute chaos.''
Many of the refugees could not imagine a situation worse than the one
they are in now, he said, and no-one is looking to the future.
''They are just coping day to day. The thing that surprised me most
was their mental condition. They are just shell-shocked.
''They ask: 'Have you any news of Zepa? Sarajevo? or Srebrenica?' They
are so concerned about their families. They have been through a
devastating experience. They are not thinking that much about the
future, because they are only interested in now and getting through the
next few days and weeks alive.''

Los Angeles, Wednesday
LARRY Hagman, who became a television legend as scheming oilman J R
Ewing in the long-running series Dallas, has a cancerous tumour on his
liver and will need a transplant, his publicist said today.
Hagman disclosed in late June that doctors had detected a small tumour
on his liver and publicist Richard Grant said tests showed it was
malignant.
The discovery complicates Hagman's earlier diagnosis of cirrhosis of
the liver, which he developed three years ago, and he has been put on a
national waiting list for a donor liver, Grant said.
''In spite of this latest development, Hagman remains in excellent
health and spirits and his prognosis for a full recovery and long life
is excellent,'' Grant said, citing the opinion of Hagman's medical team.
The tumour was found during a routine checkup at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Centre in Los Angeles and was in an early stage of development, doctors
said.
Hagman, 63, was diagnosed as having cirrhosis of the liver in 1992.
Grant said there would be no further comment on Hagman's condition
until a donor liver has been identified and surgery has been scheduled
at Cedars-Sinai.
Hagman became an international TV legend in Dallas, playing a rich
Texas oilman who schemed to destroy his enemies, betray his friends and
have his wife committed to a mental institution.
The series, one of the most popular of its era, ran from 1978 to 1991.
Hagman recently finished filming in the role of a Texas oilman in
Oliver Stone's upcoming biographical movie, Nixon.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Wednesday
A DISGRUNTLED employee went on a shooting rampage at the city's
technical building today, killing four people, police said.
One person died at the scene and the other three succumbed to injuries
at a local hospital, said Lieutenant John Dunkin, a police spokesman.
All four victims were city employees.
Police rushed to the scene and took the gunman into custody after the
shooting spree at the C Edwin Piper Technical Centre, Dunkin said.
The building houses the city's printing, car repair and communications
departments along with some of the police department's support
operations, including the crime laboratory where blood and DNA testing
was done for the O J Simpson double-murder trial.

Union, South Carolina,
Wednesday
WITHIN two days of reporting that a man had kidnapped her sons Susan
Smith was faking tears as she faced accusations she was involved the
boys' deaths, a court heard today.
''She would make whimpering or crying but there would be no water in
her eyes,'' FBI agent David Espie told Smith's double murder trial in
Union, South Carolina.
''I knew it was a defence on her part to hide the truth from me,'' he
said.
Smith confessed last November to making up story that her car had been
hijacked after she drowned her sons Michael, three, and Alex, 14 months.
She had strapped them in the back seat of the car before rolling it
into a lake on October 25.
If she is convicted the jury must decide whether to impose the death
penalty, which requires a unanimous vote.
Espie said he had accused Smith of being involved in the deaths during
an interview on October 27 while the rest of the US remained transfixed
by the hunt for the phantom carjacker.
He said Smith's response was: ''How could you believe that I could
harm my own children?'' She appeared to be crying, but Espie, a trained
interrogator, said it was a ploy.
Police investigator David Caldwell said he had asked a day earlier
whether Smith's relationship with the son of a wealthy textile company
owner had anything to do with the disappearance of the children. He said
he too was met with feigned sobbing and protestations that rang false.
The next day, after Smith had been interviewed by Espie, Caldwell said
he accused her of killing the boys. She slammed her hand down angrily
and said: ''Son of a bitch, I can't believe you think that.'' She then
stormed out of the room.
The prosecution claims Smith killed the boys in a premeditated attempt
to rescue her failing relationship with a man and that the car-jacking
story was part of a cover-up.
The defence says the deaths were the impulsive act of a woman driven
by mental instability and a troubled life.
Police sketch artist Roy Paschal told the court that his suspicions
were raised as he worked with Smith on a sketch with her in the pre-dawn
hours after she first reported the boys' disappearance.
He said Smith had given an increasingly specific description of the
man she said forced her out of her car and drove away with her sons.
Initially, she said she had barely seen the man.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Wednesday
THE Bosnian Serb army tonight claimed that the embattled Muslim
enclave of Zepa had fallen to its troops and that the town's civilian
representatives had surrendered.
However, in Sarajevo the Bosnian government strongly denied the claim.
The reported capture comes eight days after the Serbs dealt the United
Nations its greatest humiliation of the bloody Bosnian war by seizing
the ''safe area'' of Srebrenica, just north of Zepa.
Zepa had been under heavy Serb attack since last Friday, when
government forces and thousands of civilians were given an ultimatum to
lay down their arms and leave the remote, mountainous enclave.
''Representatives of Zepa's mostly Muslim population accepted
surrender conditions at a meeting with Bosnian Serb army commander
General Ratko Mladic,'' a Serb statement said tonight.
It added that some 30 wounded government soldiers would be evacuated
to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo in UN vehicles tomorrow.
The Bosnian Serbs said civilians in Zepa ''who want'' will be
evacuated to Kladanj in government-held territory with a UN escort.
The Serbs expelled some 30,000 Muslims from the nearby Srebrenica
enclave after seizing it last week.
Bosnian Serb spokesman Jovan Zametica said: ''The liberation of Zepa
by Serb forces represents a reminder to the international community that
it is about time to discard illusions.
''The Serbs are amazed by the international community's capacity for
self-deception. The international community is sick and it needs help.
We, the Serbs, intend to sober it up.''
However, a representative of Zepa in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo
said: ''The last contact we had with Zepa was one hour ago and Zepa has
not fallen.
''The safe area of Zepa consists of 20 small villages. There is a
possibility that the Serbs have entered some of the remote villages but
the Zepa town has not fallen itself.''
Shortly before the Serb claim to have taken Zepa the mayor said on a
ham radio link that widespread panic had broken out as Bosnian Serb
troops closed in.
''The Serbs have not yet penetrated the town but there is huge panic
in the population,'' said Mayor Mehmet Hajric.
He said the people were expecting ''a similar fate to that which
befell Srebrenica . . . murdering and slaughter in the streets''.
Town officials were said to have largely lost control of the
population because of the panic.
The mayor said the commander of the town's 79 Ukrainian UN
peacekeepers had crossed military lines over to the besieging Bosnian
Serbs, but his men had stayed behind.
Earlier, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic warned the West that his
men would attack Western forces if they attempted to defend the nearby
''safe haven'' of Gorazde.
UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward said Karadzic's threat had
to be taken seriously.
Nato air strikes against Bosnian Serb targets in May ended in debacle
with Serb forces taking nearly 400 UN peacekeepers hostage. Last week
Serb forces threatened to shell refugees after Nato launched two minor
strikes.
With Srebrenica and probably Zepa lost to the Serbs Gorazde remains
the last of three UN-designated ''safe areas'' in eastern Bosnia.
Meanwhile, President Clinton fought today to block a Senate move to
lift the Bosnia arms embargo, playing for time as America and its allies
tried to work out how to restore Western credibility in the Balkans.
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said he wanted a Senate vote to lift
the embargo and allow Bosnia's Muslims to defend themselves against the
Serbs.
But Clinton officials -- backed by visiting Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind --warned that would mean the end of the UN peacekeeping effort
in Bosnia and would damage the Nato alliance.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said: ''That's a day I don't
want to contemplate because it would clearly produce tensions with our
allies.''
Rifkind said there was ''no ambiguity'' that Nato allies providing
troops for the UN force would pull them out if Washington lifted the
embargo.

GLASGOW, Edinburgh, and even Aberdeen may be scratched from the list

Glasgow, Perth, Inverness, and Oban were earmarked in a recent

However, Mr Donald Macsween, chief executive of An Comunn, yesterday
confirmed he was not happy with that assumption.
He said: ''This was an independently commissioned report and there is
a lot still to be discussed within An Comunn. My own view is that
Glasgow, for example, is too big. The Mod gets lost in a city like
that.''
Ms Anne Souter, the current Mod convener, gave her backing to the
chief executive, adding that she would like to see more than four
options: ''I have to say that Edinburgh and Aberdeen are also too big.''

A BOOK by a member of The Herald's staff has been short-listed for
Britain's top travel writing award. In Search of Tusitala: Travels in
the Pacific after Robert Louis Stevenson, by Gavin Bell, is one of five
books being considered for the Thomas Cook/Daily Telegraph Travel Book
Award 1995.
The annual award was founded by Thomas Cook in 1980 to encourage and
publicise the best in narrative travel writing. Previous winners have
included Paul Theroux, Gavin Young, and Colin Thubron.
Announcing the short-list in London yesterday, Sir John Ure, chairman
of the judging panel and non-executive director of the Thomas Cook
group, said: ''The standard of narrative travel books has been
exceptionally high this year and selecting the short-list was extremely
tough.
''The five books chosen have been selected for their originality,
style, and entertainment value. We were also looking for a quality of
writing that creates a desire to travel in the reader. I am confident
that the books in our short-list do precisely that.''
The other books in the list are Travels in a Thin Country by Sara
Wheeler, Grandmother's Footsteps by Imogen Lycett Green, The Lost Heart
of Asia by Colin Thubron, and The Road to Miran by Christa Paula. The
winning title will be announced on September 20 at a reception in
London, when the author will receive a cheque for #7500.
Mr Bell, formerly a foreign correspondent with The Times, spent eight
months retracing the travels of RLS through some of the most remote
islands of the South Seas. He returned to Scotland to join The Herald as
a features writer shortly after his book was published by Picador last
November.
He has been invited by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society to give
a series of illustrated lectures on his travels early next year.

VETERAN comedian Michael Bentine had double cause to celebrate
yesterday -- he visited Buckingham Palace to collect a CBE and revealed
he was winning his battle against cancer.
''It's in remission. That sounds like you've been convicted of
something but long may it continue,'' said Bentine, a former Goon.
''It has been marvellous here today but I've never been so frightened
in my life. It was like the first night at the London Palladium.
''But Her Majesty has an amazing shattering smile which is so
wonderful and she said to me, 'You have been at it a long time, haven't
you?'
''I had three marvellous letters from princes when the announcement
was made and I was in America at the time.
''I received one from the Prince of Wales, one from Prince Michael of
Kent, and the other from Prince Philip, all of whom I have known for a
long time.''
He posed outside the palace with his wife Clementina, daughter Suki,
and daughter-in-law Becky.
Pointing to his headgear, he said: ''I've not worn a top hat for some
years but they are wonderful for keeping ice-cream in the summer and
frogs in winter.''
Also receiving an award was Olympic bronze medal-winning javelin
thrower, Steve Backley, who received an MBE.
He said: ''I was very nervous but it all seemed to go off very
smoothly.
''I am training for the world championships at Gothenberg in three
weeks and I seem to be very much in form. I put in a good performance
last week at Crystal Palace.''
He arrived with his girlfriend, Leigh Little, and his parents John and
Pauline.
Another at the palace to receive an award was veteran Tory MP Sir
Julian Critchley, who was knighted for political services.

FINANCIER Peter Clowes has lost a bid for parole after serving one
third of a 10-year sentence imposed on him for stealing #16m entrusted
by savers to his international investment company.
A judge ruled in the High Court in London yesterday that the Parole
Board had been entitled to decide that Clowes needed more time in prison
''to examine his attitude to his dishonesty''.
The board had rejected as ''unrealistic'' his intention to repay
defrauded investors, who were mostly elderly.
Ms Cherie Booth QC, wife of Labour leader Tony Blair, argued that the
board's primary focus should have been on whether there was any risk of
Clowes reoffending.
''Far from being a risk to the public, Mr Clowes is in fact no risk
whatsoever. He has been a model prisoner,'' she said. It was also
perfectly clear that he was ''full of remorse for what has happened to
his investors''.
Clowes, 52, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, was jailed in February 1992 after a
112-day trial.

Mr MacDonald pointed to Mr Angus Malavin, 32, in the dock and said:
''That man there. He never gave us a chance. He shot my brother right in
the back.''
Mr Malavin, of Acre Drive, Summerston, Glasgow, denies shooting and
murdering Mr Allan MacDonald, of Sandbank Street, Maryhill, Glasgow, in
nearby Sandbank Crescent, on March l6 last.
He also denies shooting and attempting to murder Mr Iain MacDonald,
and has lodged a special defence of alibi.
Mr Malavin further denies assaulting Mr Iain MacDonald in Frames
Snooker Club, Maryhill, on November 4 or 5 last, and assaulting him
again in the Kessington Bar, Maryhill Road, on January 2 last.
Mr MacDonald, who gave his address as c/o the police, said he and his
brother were members of the Orange Lodge in Sandbank Street, Maryhill,
and had been drinking there on March 16.
Seconds after leaving the Orange Hall with his brother, he heard a
bang and turned to see a man with a gun which was still smoking.
He and his brother ran in different directions.
Mr MacDonald said: ''I ran towards my car parked nearby and the gunman
chased me. He chased me around and around the car. Every time he tried
to take aim to shoot me I dodged him.'' He said the shotgun had two
barrels and the gunman was ''trying to shoot me over the car''.
Mr MacDonald said Mr Malavin fired and he felt a burning on his right
shoulder.
He told the court that Mr Malavin ran away and he ran after him past
his brother, who was lying on grass at the edge of the canal. Mr
MacDonald said he chased Mr Malavin into Culloden Drive, and when the
accused saw him he stopped and shouted: ''You are not getting me.''
He said that Mr Malavin then shouted ''you are getting it'', and came
at him while trying to reload the gun.
Mr MacDonald said he ran back to the Orange Hall and shouted for help
before going to his brother, who was barely conscious. They were taken
to hospital and later he was told his brother had died.
Describing the previous attacks, he said that in the snooker club Mr
Malavin had attacked him and struck him with tumblers.
On January 2, in the Kessington Bar, he saw Mr Malavin and went to
shake his hand and ''square things up'', but he claimed the accused
struck him on the head with a bottle.
Questioned by Mr Herbert Kerrigan, QC, defending, Mr MacDonald said he
had been a boxer, but denied he was violent outside the ring ''unless
attacked''.
He agreed hearing rumours that his former girlfriend, Ms Nancy
Proctor, was having a relationship with Mr Malavin, but denied this had
angered him and he had attacked Mr Malavin in the snooker club and in
the bar.
He said that on the night of the shootings Mr Malavin was wearing a
baggy jogging suit with a hood, and said that at the time he told police
the gunman was wearing a mask he was in shock.
Later, in hospital, he told police that Mr Malavin was the gunman.
The trial, before Lord Milligan, continues.

<HEADLINE>Decision time on Bosnia is here, says Portillo as MPs press fears for troops</HEADLINE>

THE time is ripe for decisions on Bosnia, Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo told the Commons last night.
In a debate on the situation, he said it was time for the warring
factions to contemplate the stark reality of United Nations withdrawal.
In a clear pointer to the international summit due to take place in
London tomorrow, he said it was time for the nations involved in the
peace-keeping operations in former Yugoslavia to decide on what terms
they were willing to stay.
In a tense debate attended by a large number of MPs on the last day
before the Commons rose for the summer recess, Mr Portillo said that
amid the chaos the United Nations was trying to bring succour, relief
and sanity. However, what the UN could not do was end the war by
military means. In practice, it could be ended only by a political
solution.
Tory John Townend (Bridlington) reminded him of the maxim that British
troops did not get involved on the ground in a Balkan war and said many
people wanted our troops brought back ''forthwith''.
Mr Portillo said Britain felt her responsibilities acutely.''We are
not in Bosnia to fight a war. We are there to save lives.''
The UN forces could not stop all the horrors. ''But that does not mean
we can do nothing. Indeed we have achieved a great deal.''
Pressed over the possibility of military intervention to bring the war
to an end, Mr Portillo said this was unrealistic.
''To bring this war to an end militarily would require the commitment
of hundreds of thousands of men and armaments at enormous risk to those
forces.
''I don't believe it is possible to commit those forces to this
theatre and even if we did I think our chances of success would be
remote.''
In closing last night's debate, which ended without a vote, Foreign
Office Minister of State Sir Nicholas Bonsor appeared to set the scene
for a possible British withdrawal, although he made clear the situation
still was under review.
He said the Government remained convinced that UNPROFOR had a role to
play. To get humanitarian aid through to those who needed it most, all
avenues to achieve a political settlement had to be pursued.
However, Sir Nicholas warned that there may have to be a withdrawal
because there was a limit to the risks to which British troops could be
exposed.
For Labour, Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the UN must stay
in the former Yugoslavia.
Only if commanders on the ground said it was too dangerous for British
troops to remain should they be withdrawn, and people demanding
withdrawal in any other circumstance must ask what message they were
sending the Karadjic Serbs.
''The message we are in danger of sending to them by talking of
withdrawal is that with a little more pressure we will pack up and get
out of their way.
''If I'm right, then the demands for withdrawal do not serve the
interests of our troops there. They make it all the more likely that
they will come under that extra pressure.''
He said: ''Our response to the setbacks in Bosnia should not be to
accept defeat and pull out, but to show a new determination to carry out
the UN mandate.''
Former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, in his first speech from the
Tory back benches since retiring from the Cabinet, told the House there
was a role for air power in Bosnia and there could be a role for it
again in the next few weeks to deter Bosnian Serb attacks on Gorazde or
Sarajevo.
However, he warned: ''I do not believe it is possible from the air to
bomb the Bosnian Serbs into coming to the conference table and reaching
a peaceful settlement.''
People supported the humanitarian aid work being done in Bosnia and
wished that effort to continue so long as it could, he said. The next
two to three months could be ''the climax in deciding whether it can''.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Menzies Campbell called for UN
assurances that a route into Sarajevo for humanitarian relief would be
opened and maintained ''with military means if necessary''.
He urged: ''We cannot have the strangulation of that city with all the
consequences for the people who live there.''

CONSERVATIVE MPs last night succeeded in delaying implementation of
two key reforms stemming from the Nolan committee report on Members'
interests.
They defeated a Labour call for MPs to be obliged to make public any
contracts they have for parliamentary services and how much in round
figures they are paid for them. Voting was 282 votes to 248, a majority
of 34.
It appeared that one Tory voted for Labour's amendment, Mr Alan
Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon).
The Tories also were able to beat off a further Labour proposal to
accept the principle of the Nolan recommendations on fuller disclosure
of their financial interests by MPs -- by 283 votes to 261, a majority
of 22.
The Commons Leader, Mr Tony Newton, said the Government believed that
the special committee set up by the House to examine the Nolan
recommendations needed longer to construct definitions of just what
interests should be covered by new rules.
He said: ''If we are to ban some activities, we need to be absolutely
clear what is to be banned.''
Mr Newton said the Nolan report used various phrases to describe
activities it thought should be disclosed, but had not provided a clear
single definition.
A special all-party select committee of MPs will meet today to arrange
further sessions in September at which they will seek to provide forms
of words on which MPs can vote when they return from the summer recess
in October.
The new rules have to be in place by the next session of Parliament,
which opens in November.
Labour MPs said they feared the Government would use the time it had
won to think of ways of watering down the Nolan recommendations which
have infuriated many backbench Tory MPs who work for consultancy firms.
Mr Newton assured them that he was not seeking to delay in order to
try to undermine Nolan.
Mr John Evans, Labour MP for St Helens North, a member of the select
committee, said he was very concerned about the wording of the main
Government motion on Nolan, which was finally passed without a vote.
It spoke of the ''need for an examination of the recommendations
relating to consultancies''. Mr Evans said the thought of disclosing
their earnings from this source was ''anathema'' to many Tory MPs. Mr
Newton knew there was a strong desire in his party ''to kick Nolan as
far as they can into the long grass''.
Shadow Commons Leader Mrs Ann Taylor said constituents would be
checking the voting lists to see who had voted for secrecy.
She said that some Labour MPs believed MPs should have no outside
interests and should have their tax returns made public.
Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath attacked the Labour proposals
which, he said, showed ''an insatiable desire of prying into other
people's affairs.''
MPs already declared if they had an interest when speaking in debates
or asking parliamentary questions. There was no need for the extent of
that interest to be known.
Of the original ''cash for questions'' affair involving Tory MPs David
Tredinnick and Graham Riddick, Sir Edward said: ''To think all this was
brought about by two . . . '', he paused and a shout of ''idiots'' came
from the benches behind him.
Sir Edward: ''Yes, they would agree they were idiots on a put-up job
from a Murdoch paper, and that's what all this is about.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Robert Maclennan said: ''In reaching
decisions today, none of us is likely to forget the circumstances that
gave rise to this report.
''The good name of the House of Commons, its keystone place in our
democracy, must be in all our minds.
''This House validates government. If that process were to be
corrupted by self-interested action of MPs, it would diminish our claim
to speak for the country.And if this House could not speak for the
country, who would.''
MPS agreed without a vote to establish a Parliamentary Commissioner
for Standards, and to amalgamate two existing committees to form a
single select committee on Standards and Privileges.
They also agreed that the special select committee should prepare a
draft code of conduct for MPs.
* Later, Lord Nolan issued a statement saying his committee had ''made
it clear that aspects of the position on consultancies needed further
consideration by Parliament, and obviously it would be very satisfactory
if this issue was resolved by the autumn''.
He welcomed the ''speed and depth'' of consideration that MPs had
given the Nolan report, adding: ''It was clear to the committee that the
best way to allay public anxiety was prompt and firm action.''

THE best club in the world isn't what it was and if this Nolan
chappie's ideas are taken up it will hardly be worth belonging to. This
general Tory view of a committee Oliver Cromwell would have been proud
to set up was given majestic expression yesterday by Sir Edward Heath as
the Commons debated whether to act on its recommendations.
As a former Chief Whip, one of the best ever -- never mind a former
Prime Minister as holders of that office lead a more sheltered life --
Ted knows what goes on and who does it. Nor was there ever any
suggestion that when he was policing the Conservative Parliamentary
Party he ran anything other than a pretty tight ship.
''Transparency'' in all MPs financial dealings is the mantra word
which the Opposition has nailed to its mast. Tell the world what
parliamentary services you provide for consultancy firms and how much
you get paid for them.
After the Shadow Commons Leader Mrs Ann Taylor had completed a
forceful but controlled speech, Sir Edward rose to tell her that it was
not a great improvement on the one she made in the previous Nolan
debate. ''She was screaming throughout her speech for immediate action
without proper consideration'' he complained.
The trouble with Labour was that it was ''consumed by an insatiable
desire of prying into other peoples affairs'' steamed Sir Edward.
At which point, he was venomously interrupted by Mr Dale
Campbell-Savours (Workington-Labour) telling him from a seated position
''you broke a rule of the House of Commons.'' This referred to Ted's
refusal to give details of his Lloyd's interests to the Members'
Register.
Ted is crushing but virtually uncrushable. He and other Names had gone
along to the chairman of the Members' Interests Committee and explained
the position and the request was withdrawn ''because the committee saw
they were wrong.''
This time, however, Sir Edward was on collision course with the Spirit
of the Age and it is likely to prove too strong even for him.
If a Member spoke in a debate or asked a question about something in
which he had a financial interest, he pointed out, that member already
declared the interest. There was no need for him to declare how much the
interest was bringing in. She'll be wanting to see our bank accounts
next, he growled at Mrs Taylor, who has certainly succeeded in getting
under his skin better than the mere likes of Harold Wilson or Denis
Healey, and now could be his second least favourite politician (Lady
Thatcher's position in first place still looks unassailable).
Ted was just getting into the detail of other recommendations which he
disliked when another comparatively new rule cut him off in mid-flow. It
restricts backbench speeches to 10 minutes at certain times.     This
is, generally speaking, a good rule, but Ted was giving such excellent
value that it seemed a shame to stop him. Indeed, as the figures on the
digital clock approached nemesis one wondered if the occupant of the
chair would be hardy enough to enforce the rule.
However, Dame Janet Fookes (Plymouth Drake -- Con.), if distinctly
un-Thatcherite in politics, runs her former leader close on will power.
She was sorry but . .  Sir Edward could hardly believe it, protested but
subsided, transparenty nonplussed.

<HEADLINE>Anger at Shephard plans for work at age 14</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977305822</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EDUCATION Secretary Gillian Shephard last night stood by controversial
proposals which would see 14-year-olds spend some of their school time
in the workplace.
She promised new initiatives, in addition to developing vocational
qualifications and school-business partnerships, aimed at remotivating
children who have given up on school.
Mrs Shephard rejected criticisms that the scheme -- proposed for south
of the Border -- would deepen the divide between bright and less
academic children while offloading difficult pupils on to employers.
There are no plans at present to introduce such a scheme in Scotland.
Other changes to the examination system in secondary schools still are
to be introduced, and further changes are unlikely until these changes
are bedded in.
Mrs Shephard, speaking at the Council of Local Education Authorities
in Brighton, said: ''There is a case for having more work-based
education for certain groups of young people, if, thereby, we can avoid
demotivation and do something useful for employers at the same time.''
She believed an early introduction to work could instil discipline
into children ''and help them to see the point of getting
qualifications.''
However, Mrs Shephard insisted that the Government has no intention of
''turning youngsters out into the workforce at 14''.
They would continue to follow the national curriculum.
On the question of pay for such work experience, she said: ''We do not
intend using them as cheap labour.''
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress,
described the proposals as half-baked, and said age 14 was too young for
''sustained work-based training''.
He added: ''While we have always supported giving school students the
opportunity to experience the world of work as part of their education,
this scheme looks like an attempt to off-load difficult pupils on to
employers.''
Local authority leaders condemned Mrs Shephard's ideas as a return to
the Dickens era.
Mr Graham Lane, education chairman of the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities said her proposals were ''very, very dangerous.
''If a child is bored and badly motivated, is a teacher going tell
them to go down to the local store and do some filing and hope that when
they come back they will be better able to do their maths?''

TONY BLAIR yesterday warned Labour MPs of a Tory fightback and urged
them to fight ''every minute of every hour of every day'' for a General
Election victory.
He told back benchers that any hint of complacency in the run-up to
the election risked a fifth Tory victory through the back door.
''We cannot afford just to wait for the Tories to lose the election,
we have to go out and win,'' he said in an end-of-term speech at the
Commons which marked both the end of the parliamentary session and his
first year in office.
The Labour leadership is determined to stop MPs and party activists
resting on their laurels in the face of huge opinion poll leads and the
unpopularity of the Government.
Party strategists believe John Major will go on the attack as the
Tories mount a desperate bid over the next two years to stay in power.
Mr Blair acknowledged major Labour successes in Parliament --
particularly halting a rise in VAT on fuel -- and in elections, but
warned there must be no dropping of the guard.
''There are absolutely no grounds for complacency and I don't want to
hear a single person saying the election is in the bag,'' he said.
''We have to fight every minute of every hour of every day to make
sure we put our case. There are people out there who don't know what we
stand for and what we have been trying to achieve.''
Mr Blair said Labour now was fighting from a position of record
strength in depth after 12 months characterised by a great deal of
progress in repositioning the party in the mainstream of political life.
He turned on critics of his style and policies, insisting: ''It is
completely wrong to say that this has meant stealing Tory clothes or
following in their wake.
''We are winning the policy agenda. If anything, they are now trying
to get on to our agenda, but they can't because they are more divided
and extreme.''
Mr Blair ran through the entire policy agenda, emphasising the strong
economic message now being pushed out based on the themes of partnership
at work and tackling long-term unemployment and investment.
At the same meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, MPs gave an
overwhelming endorsement to a new plan to appoint the party Chief Whip
from inside the Shadow Cabinet.
The move was carried by 132 votes to 26 after being proposed by
current Chief Whip Derek Foster, who steps down in the autumn after 10
years in the job.
It will give Mr Blair a firm grip across the board at Parliament,
replacing a system where the Chief Whip -- who is responsible for party
management -- was elected in a separate ballot of MPs.

A SUPERMARKET plans to banish check-out queues with a revolutionary
self-scanner that relies on customers' honesty to total up their
shopping bill.
Shoppers are given a hand-held bar code scanner to clock up the prices
of their purchases as they go.
When the hand-scanner is replaced, a print-out and total for purchases
is automatically given and is checked at random.
Yesterday, customers at Safeway in Perth, the first Scottish
supermarket to try it, welcomed the system.
Mrs Kathleen Jacob, 43, said: ''In the long run, it should make
shopping a lot quicker. I think its a great idea.''

THE Tall Ships race brought #32m into the Lothian economy -- double
the minimum #16m predicted.
Announcing the figure yesterday, Mr Bob Downie, tourism manager of
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd, said: ''The event has proved even
more successful than we anticipated. It has been good for Leith, good
for Edinburgh, and good for Scotland.''
Mr Downie, speaking at a press briefing at which the success of the
event was hailed by all sides, said: ''In the long term, we have to
build on that success and promote Leith and Edinburgh as lively tourist
destinations.''
The smooth operation of the massive park-and-ride system brought into
play to prevent traffic chaos was voted one of the great organisational
achievements of the event, which drew in an estimated 1.5 million
visitors.
Over the three main days, 20,000 cars used official parking sites and
about 73,000 people used the special bus service.

RACEHORSE trainer Alex Scott was shot dead by a groom who developed
''a deep resentment'' over his working methods, a jury was told
yesterday.
Mr William O'Brien, 58, had told Mr Scott that ''he could stuff the
job'', said James Hunt, QC, prosecuting, at Norwich Crown Court.
However, after Mr Scott, 34, had sent Mr O'Brien a letter asking for
written confirmation of his resignation, there was a confrontation in a
barn at the stud farm near Newmarket, Cambridgeshire.
The groom shot Mr Scott in the chest with a single-barrel shotgun at a
range of three to five feet, saying as he pulled the trigger: ''This is
for you, bastard.''
O'Brien, who lived at a bungalow just yards from the site of the
shooting, denies murdering Mr Scott on September 30 last year and
threatening to kill gardener Christopher Forster at the stud farm on the
same occasion.
Mr Hunt told the jury Mr O'Brien was ''an obsessive worker who
developed, we say, a deep resentment and dislike of his employer, Mr
Scott, with whose methods he disagreed''.
Mr O'Brien, married but with no children, was employed as stud groom
at the Glebe Stud -- about three miles from Oak Farm Stables in
Newmarket, where Mr Scott had his main training business -- for about 10
years.
Eight of those years had been with a previous owner and Mr Scott had
bought the stud in December 1992.
''The defendant had always been regarded as a good worker, indeed a
workaholic, who loved to work but in so doing had very fixed ideas on
how things should be done,'' said Mr Hunt.
''It is apparent that he disagreed with a number of Mr Scott's ideas.
It is apparent that he felt that he was understaffed. He felt that Mr
Scott didn't know what he did. He harboured increasing resentment
against Mr Scott and became increasingly hostile.''
Mr Hunt said the row came to a head three days before the alleged
murder. On that day, the defendant apparently told a bloodstock agent
that it was not convenient for prospective purchasers to view a horse at
a particular time.
Mr Scott took exception and raised it with Mr O'Brien on September 28.
''The defendant was abusive. He told Mr Scott to stuff his job. In
effect, he was resigning.
''He told Mr Scott he should have stayed in the loony bin or words to
that effect.''
This was an abusive reference, said Mr Hunt, to the fact that Mr Scott
had some time previously ''spent some time in a nursing home when he was
suffering from depression''.
Mr Hunt said Mr Scott then sent Mr O'Brien a letter asking him to
confirm his intention to resign by signing the letter and returning it.
After receiving the letter, Mr O'Brien had spoken to Mr Forster, the
gardener, who lived in a nearby cottage, telling him: ''The old man will
be down to see me tonight. I think I will be finished.
''When he comes out, I am going to have it out in the barn and shut
the door and have it out with him, and no-one will hear what is going
on.''
Mr Scott took the precaution of taking Mr Forster with him when he
went to the barn at about 5.30pm that Friday evening.
Mr Scott told Mr O'Brien he was suspended and the three of them began
to take Mr O'Brien's property out of the barn.
Eventually, Mr O'Brien said: ''I have cleared everything out,'' and Mr
Forster heard Mr Scott say: ''Fine, just lock the door.''
However, Mr O'Brien told Mr Scott: ''No, I want you to have a look and
make sure everything's all right.''
Two guns had been removed from the barn but apparently Mr O'Brien had
taken one of them back inside, ''where it was to be used on Mr Scott'',
claimed Mr Hunt.
Mr Forster saw Mr O'Brien standing over Mr Scott, aiming the shotgun
at his chest. After seeing the flash from the barrel and hearing the
bang, Mr Forster started to head away and the defendant allegedly
shouted after him: ''The next one's for you.''
Mr Forster saw Mr O'Brien lift the gun, which he had apparently
reloaded, to his shoulder, but Mr O'Brien was interrupted by the
appearance of his wife Helen, who shouted something to him.
Mr Forster went away to call for help and to warn Mrs Scott.
Mr O'Brien went to the home of another employee and then went missing.
He was found the next morning a few hundred yards away.
Mr Scott's widow Julia, 38, and his mother, Lady Anne Scott, sat in
the public seats as Mr Hunt showed the jury the shotgun allegedly used
by Mr O'Brien.
Judge, jury, and counsel will visit the scene of the shooting today.

TOURISM officials yesterday admitted that more work had to be done to
halt the continuing decline of the Scottish industry and to encourage
more visitors, particularly the English, north of the Border.
Results last year had been ''desperately disappointing''.
The Scottish Tourist Board's annual report reveals that more than 10
million business or holiday trips were made north of the Border in 1994.
The financial value of the visits is put at #2005m, a drop of 6% or
around #130m on the year before.
Although the number of overseas visitors grew by two per cent, the
number of people from other parts of Britain holidaying in Scotland
dropped by 10%.
The North-east of Scotland, particularly Grampian region, seemed badly
hit by the decline.
Around #695m was injected into the Scottish economy by overseas
visitors and #1310m by home-based tourists.
A breakdown of the home visitor figures shows that 4.4 million
business or holiday visits were made by Scots in their own country,
generating around #474m. There were 4.1 million visits by people from
elsewhere in Britain, bringing in #838m.
The board admitted that it would have to do more to target the home
market, particularly the South-east of England, where there was still a
''lack of awareness'' of what Scotland had to offer.
The board's chairman, Mr Ian Grant, said the English market was a
priority. A budget of #4m had been set aside to promote Scotland south
of the Border, including a #2.8m advertising campaign. Overall, the STB
spent around #20m.
Mr Grant said: ''England is our biggest single market. We have found
there is not enough awareness there of what Scotland has to offer. Some
people think it takes a day-and-a-half to get here, it shuts at
weekends, and they shouldn't go during the winter because the roads are

STB's chief executive, Mr Derek Reid, described 1994 as a watershed
year for the industry.
However, he was confident things would improve with the right level of
commitment from the industry. Early indications for this year showed
visitor figures would be up and there would be a brighter picture for
growth and prosperity in Scottish tourism.
He felt that films such as Rob Roy and Braveheart could only benefit
the industry.

SCOTTISH parents have been praised for the way they treat their
youngsters, as two of the country's biggest children's charities called
for more resources to improve child care services.
A report published today by Save the Children says that thousands of
children and parents in Scotland and the UK will lose out this summer
because of a lack of play schemes and other facilities.
NCH Action for Children has called on the Government to invest a tiny
fraction of income tax revenues to ''mark the millennium with an
investment in Scottish children''.
The No Place To Play report claims that around 85% of school-age
children will not find a place in a child care centre this summer. It
adds that low income families often suffer the most.
It says thousands of children will miss out on the opportunity to mix
in a stimulating and educational environment.
Save the Children also commissioned a survey which found that parents'
main concerns about school age youngsters' holiday activities were
safety and cost. The charity called for more affordable, high quality
schemes to meet the needs of children and parents.
Ms Alison Davies, Scottish director of the charity, said parents in
Scotland traditionally used play schemes more than those in other parts
of the country.
She added: ''That tradition is positive and long may it continue. We
have also noticed that the reasons Scottish people use child care
services is often altruistic, focusing on the child rather than the
parent.
Meanwhile, NCH Action for Children today issues a ''shopping list''
detailing what child care services could be provided if a tenth of a
penny in the pound income tax was spent supporting the country's most
vulnerable children.
The charity said the tax levy could raise #175m to help disabled
youngsters, victims of abuse and deprivation, and children suffering the
effects of homelessness and family breakdown.
Its Scottish director, Mr Reg McKay, said many children and families
north of the Border could benefit from a #16m share of the cash total.
He added: ''With the year 2000 nearing, we should make some very
serious decisions about our priorities. It would take very little money
to actually provide services and stop problems and pain in the future.''
He said the relatively small amount of money required to improve
services contrasted sharply with plans to allow a 3% increase in tax
under a Scottish parliament.
Mr McKay added: ''While local authorities and the voluntary sector
deliver the services, it would require central government intervention
to allocate extra money, particularly for small and rural communities.
''The geography and distribution of people in Scotland should be taken
into account. Every child and parent has a right to services, wherever
they live.''
A so-called fact file, published by the charity from Government
figures, shows that Scotland has high rates of lone parent families,
births outside marriage, and infant mortality. It also showed that large
numbers of low-income Scots -- around half in the study -- went hungry
to feed their children.

CYMBALS tinkled, glistening prayer-wheels spun, and a huge golden
Buddha looked down on the scene.
Mr Lenny Jewitt and Ms Jane Good were being married -- Buddhist style.
Watched by more than 100 guests in the ornate temple at the Samye-Ling
Tibetan Centre, near Eskdalemuir, the couple sat cross-legged in front
of the abbot, Dr Akong Tulku Rinpoche, who presided at the colourful
ceremony.
Dr Tulku is the only Tibetan Buddhist monk in Scotland who has been
granted permission to solemnise weddings, but he is only occasionally
called on to officiate.
Mr Jewitt, 46, and his bride, 32, have a long association with the
centre and decided to have a Buddhist wedding. A graphic designer, he
has worked there for 17 years and helped decorate the temple. She is an
occupational therapist from Creetown but looked after the cattle during
her five years at Samye-Ling.
Mr Jewitt said: ''It was wonderful to be married in the temple which I
helped to decorate. I did a lot of work on the ceiling.'' His bride
added: ''It was a beautiful ceremony.''

IN bald and often technical language, the ''military aircraft accident
summary'' analyses what went wrong and who was to blame for the crashing
of the BAe 146 of the Queen's Flight on June 29 last year.
It took off from Aberdeen 23 minutes late and the captain and
co-pilot, both unnamed in the report, accepted that the Prince of Wales
would arrive late at Islay, given the lack of scope to make up time on
such a short flight.
As the aircraft was in descent, 10 minutes before landing, Prince
Charles took the controls from the co-pilot and sat in his seat, on the
left side of the cockpit.
The royal passenger then flew the remainder of the approach and landed
the aircraft as the ''handling pilot'' under the supervision of the
captain, who was the prince's usual pilot.
On the journey, the crew was given information about conditions at
Islay, including the cloud cover and the 20-knot surface wind, and the
report said it was also told that both runways were available for
landing.
Because of the cloud and high ground to the south-east, the captain
chose an approach which kept the options of either landing on one runway
with a tailwind, or circling and landing into the wind on the other
runway.
The captain briefed the prince of his intentions but ''made no
mention'' of the tailwind, said the report. To stay clear of cloud, he
told the prince to follow a procedure which would line up the plane for
runway 13, the one with the tailwind, on an approach path higher and
faster than normal.
Twice during the final stages of the approach, air traffic controllers
passed on surface wind conditions, but a combination of the tailwind of
about 12 knots, the aircraft's steep approach and speed, and ''a failure
to establish the aircraft in the correct approach configuratation''
meant it was travelling 32 knots an hour too fast when it landed.
When its nose wheels first touched down, it had just 784 metres of the
1245 metre runway left. The full range of electronic stopping devices
did not come into effect until the main wheels touched down with just
509 metres to go.
The brakes were then applied before the full anti-skid protection
system was activated and the inboard main wheels locked. The right
inboard main tyre burst and the other one ''deflated'' with just 150
metres left.
As it approached the end of the runway extension, and still braking,
the captain tried to turn left on to a taxiway. The nose wheels went off
the paved surface at low speed and sank into soft ground.
The momentum slewed the plane around the nose undercarriage, which
collapsed backwards, with the plane finally coming to rest almost at
right angles to the runway.
The report notes: ''The aircraft was shut down and the occupants
evacuated from it immediately . . . They were met by the emergency
services, which had reacted promptly. There were no injuries.''
It blames the ''incident'' on the captain for allowing a mishandled
approach and landing to continue beyond a point from which a safe stop
was possible.
''The inquiry considered that, because of his failure to intervene
when the aircraft performance and aircraft limitations were exceeded in
the final stages of the flight, the captain was negligent,'' it added.
''For failure to advise the captain of the tailwind component, and to
draw his attention to the inaccurate approach parameters, the inquiry
also deemed the navigator to be negligent.''

SET in some of Scotland's most
fertile land, and lying to the north of Crimond village, which gave
its name to the famous setting of the 23rd Psalm, is the Aberdeenshire
estate of Crimonmogate, writes Bill Sinclair.
Originally part of the vast lands of the Earl of Errol, the estate has
been in the hands of the family of the present owner since the late
eighteenth century. It centres on a fine neo-classical house and
includes productive farmland, a profitable woodland enterprise and a
mature pheasant shoot.
It also claims to offer some of Scotland's best woodcock shooting, as
well as trout fishing on secluded lochs.
Crimonmogate House was designed by Archibald Simpson and is built in
the traditional granite of the area, with particularly fine
architectural details, including the magnificent Doric portico.
The accommodation, on four floors, includes a full-size billiard room,
believed to be one of the first in Britain. The mansion is set in the
heart of the well-wooded estate and is not visible from any public road.
The formal flower garden to the south and east includes an
eighteenth-century sundial.
William Jackson, the partner handling the sale for the Edinburgh
office of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, says: 'Crimonmogate is an outstanding
complete estate with a fine Regency mansion, lying a few miles to the
south of Fraserburgh and within an easy drive from Aberdeen.
'Its sale is likely to be of local and national interest, and it is
difficult to tell if it will be sold as a whole or in lots.'
There are 18 houses and cottages, and numerous other buildings, and
the estate is offered for sale in five main lots, plus a number of
separate houses.
Offers in excess of A1.6m are being sought for the property.

OLDER men are three times as likely to father Down's syndrome babies,
new medical research revealed yesterday.
Previous research has shown that the older the mother the greater the
chance of producing a Down's baby but the link with the father had not
been proved.
According to the magazine New Scientist, unpublished test results from
France now confirm the link.
In a massive test by the government's research agency INSERM,
scientists studied 11,535 pregnancies at 22 fertility clinics.
They divided them into three groups according to the age of the sperm
donor, rather than the age of the mother.
In the French research only a tiny proportion of the babies born had
Down's but, among those, there were three times as many born to donors
over 39 than to those under 35.
Among the under-35s, just 0.14% of babies had Down's, in the 35-39
group it went up to 0.23% and it was 0.41% for over 39s.
The research is still unpublished, according to the magazine, as only
25 babies were born with Down's and the scientists want to continue the
research.
Another 10,000 pregnancies are to be the subject of the biggest study
of its kind in the world.
One of the scientists, Mr Paul Jalbert, of the Centres for the Study
and Conservation of Human Eggs and Sperm, said: ''The study needs to be
taken further using techniques which would show whether the origin of
the Down's syndrome was maternal or paternal.''
Mr Howard Cuckle, professor of reproductive epidemiology at the
University of Leeds Medical School, said: ''These results show a clear
trend. It is a first step.''

<RECORDNO>977305854</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Royal College of Midwives mounted a defence of their
pay deal yesterday, on the eve of a vote of no confidence.
President Caroline Flint called for solidarity over the move, claiming
it was a ''monumental achievement'' and was ''good for midwives and good
for mothers''.
The college had originally joined 12 other health unions to oppose and
reject the Government's pay offer, then broke ranks and accepted it.
Other unions have attacked the college over the move and are still
battling over the 3% deal offered by the Government.
Anger among midwives at the council's decision to accept the new pay
structure and the principle of local pay has prompted the motion of no
confidence in the college's ruling body.
Midwives, who overturned their 115-year-old policy of non-industrial
action two months ago, will vote on the emergency motion today at their
annual conference.
In an opening address to delegates meeting in Belfast, Ms Flint said
the events of the past six months would prove a ''critical turning
point'' in the history of midwifery.
Midwives had gained a commitment from the Government to pay midwives
for working flexibly and for giving women choices in childbirth. As a
result, thousands of midwives would be upgraded -- getting rises of at
least #2000.
''What we have accepted is indeed a local pay move but it is not the
model of local pay that we -- along with other unions -- have opposed in
the past.
''We have won a package that the collective strength of other trade
unions -- nursing unions -- failed to win for midwives.
''It is no use the other unions being hypocritical now, what the RCM
has achieved for midwives is what the other unions collectively did
not.''
However, Health Department officials have said the package, which
includes proposals for midwives to be paid according to numbers of
deliveries, is not binding and is only advice on pay scales to hospital
trusts.
The emergency motion of no confidence in the ruling council of the RCM
states: ''This conference deplores council's acceptance of the NHSE
recommendations for midwives pay, grading and conditions of service,
believing that the package neither enhances their pay, grading structure
or status and proposes a vote of no confidence in council.''

<HEADLINE>Fury at radioactive finds and US move on waste.  Dounreay under fire on two fronts</HEADLINE>

ANTI-nuclear campaigners were last night mounting a two-flanked attack
on the Dounreay plant.
They repeated calls for it to be closed down until it could deal with
all radioactive contamination around the site, following the discovery
of more radioactive particles, and expressed anger at the possibility of
the arrival of more waste.
New areas of the plant were cordoned off yesterday after the latest
particles were found. Last month 20 particles were discovered on
roadside verges.
The Atomic Energy Authority's spokesman at Dounreay, Mr Ian Shepherd,
insisted last night that closing the plant would not be justified.
''We have been monitoring the area since last autumn but this was
stepped up because new street lights are due to be installed. It was
this monitoring process which found the earlier particles, but the most
recent discoveries have been made below the surface of the ground so
people were not going to come into contact with them.
''There was also some lower level contamination on fabric of the seat
of an industrial vehicle, a shunter.
''That is all being dealt with, samples are being analysed. The
contamination is not mobile. The site is safe so there would be no
reason to close it down. Our survey is due to be completed tomorrow.''
Workers at the plant have been briefed by Dounreay's director, Mr John
Baxter, who has assured them there is no health risk and that the
contamination was not being carried by workers on the site.
Mrs Lorraine Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, was not
convinced, however. She said: ''Dounreay insists that the contamination
is not mobile, but have they told that to the bird population or other
wildlife?
''Already we have had Dounreay's director suggesting that the nuclear
waste found on the grass verges may have fallen off the back of a lorry
on its way to the nuclear waste shaft 30 years ago.
''The only sensible thing to do is to shut the plant down until the
whole site is cleaned up. But they won't, because they never learn.''
She also described as outrageous the situation in which waste
originally bound for America could be sent to the plant after a decision
involving people in America, but not in Scotland.
Today marks the end of a detailed public consultation in which the
American public have been asked whether highly radioactive nuclear waste
should be stored in America or sent to Dounreay, where it would be
reprocessed in a plant nearly 40 years old.
''The public consultation in America, organised by the US Department
of Energy, has been long and very full. It was conducted over a 60-day
period and had documents lodged in libraries throughout the US. In
addition there were even public meetings,'' she said.
''At issue is the fate of thousands of rods of spent nuclear fuel,
which represent just about the most dangerous radioactive cocktail the
nuclear industry can produce. At present they are in reactors throughout
Europe and elsewhere.
''As part of its policy against proliferation of nuclear weapons, the
US Government was to take the waste back. But there was an outcry and
now the public is being consulted.
''They have been presented with options for storage in America, all
accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment spelling out the risks
to the US, along with the Dounreay option. Dounreay is viewed as having
no environmental impact on the US although it carries the greatest
risks. So which one do you think they will vote for? Dounreay must be
the front runner.''
Mrs Mann said that in addition the American people were under the
impression that the reprocessing work would be done in Dounreay's
Prototype Fast Reactor's reprocessing plant, which is just over 20 years
old, but in fact it would be in the Materials Testing Reactor's plant
which was 38 years old.
She suggested that people in this country should write to express
their views to Mr Charles Head at the Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel
Management (EM37), US Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue,
Washington 20585.
Last month The Herald revealed that, despite official denials, the
Department of Trade and Industry had been lobbying the American
Department of Energy to send this work to Dounreay.
Last night a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay
confirmed that the Caithness plant was keen to win the contract. ''We
would be proud to do this work which would help solve an increasingly
pressing problem facing research reactors throughout Europe and
elsewhere which must find an answer to their growing volmes of nuclear
waste.''
He said no decision had yet been made. ''We don't yet know if we will
get the work or not.''
He thought it possible that the American information might have made a
mistake and mentioned the PFR. ''But there is no question, it would be
in the MTR which has a record of over 30 years of successful and safe
working.
''Its long record is a positive reflection on its safety which our
regulatory authorities ensure at any rate with their strict safety
standards.''
He stressed that all reprocessing contracts carried a condition that
the material would be returned to country of origin.

MR HANN'S sacking was met with a potent mixture of fury and sorrow by
opposition parties and trade unions.
There were also questions over the role, if any, Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth played in the dismissal.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the
dismissal was contemptible. He said: ''Mr Hann has paid a high price for
publicly defending Scottish Nuclear as a separate entity.
''He has done an excellent job for SN but clearly did not reckon on
just how duplicitous his political masters can be.
''The appointments make a mockery of the assurances given by Ian Lang
about the lead role of SN within a merged privatised company. The same
Mr Lang has now approved the structure which effectively confirms
Nuclear Electric and its senior personnel as the dominant forces in the
new company. Mr Lang has changed jobs and been told what the real script
should be.''
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, said Mr Hann was paying the price
for putting his trust in Ian Lang and standing up for SN's independence.
He said: ''His sacking shows that SN has lost the power struggle over
the merged nuclear company. This anti-Scottish move increases the
already substantial concern about the structure of the merged company,
adding to the fears that decision making power and jobs will be focused
south of the Border.
''It also suggests tension between the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Scottish Office. Ian Lang has clearly sold out since
leaving St Andrew's House. A key question which must be answered is
whether Michael Forsyth was consulted over this decision.''
Mr Adam Ingram, Labour MP for East Kilbride, where SN has its
headquarters, said the decision to sack Mr Hann could only be
interpreted as a vindictive action on the part of Mr Lang.
''It will further damage the morale of the workforce who have worked
long and hard to make the company one of the most successful enterprises
in Scotland. Without Mr Hann to champion its cause, SN must now face an
uncertain future.''
Mr George Robertson, Shadow Scottish Secretary, said: ''The drive
towards privatisation at all costs has produced a real casualty. Mr Hann
made a commercial and safety success of SN but he has now been cast
aside in the mad rush to sell off the nuclear reactors.
''This privatisation is introuble with safety considerations
unresolved and the timetable way behind schedule. The panic reaction of
the Government is to dump the architect of the highly profitable, safe
public nuclear company.
''This is one of the maddest privatisations of all and Mr Lang and
Michael Forsyth are in disarray. So much for the triple lock on a
distinct identity for SN when the first act of the new joint chairman is
to sack the Scottish boss. Every other assurance given on this
privatisation is now worthless after this act of management vandalism.''
Mr Robertson said Mr Forsyth must say what his role was in the affair.
''Was he consulted? Did he agree? Is he content that a highly regarded
and successful chairman is dumped the day after his annual report shows
no subsidy and record profit in the public sector?''
Mrs Ray Michie, Scottish Liberal Democrat spokeswoman, said it spoke
volumes for the nuclear industry's commitment to Scotland that the man
who had spoken up for Scotland had been removed.
She said: ''The intention of the new company seems to be to
marginalise Scotland as quickly as possible.
''The decision to locate the new company's HQ in Scotland designed to
save Ian Lang's face now looks vulnerable. Those who have campaigned for
SN to remain independent are being proved right.''
The trade unions in SN, which are opposing the privatisation plans,
said they were very sorry at Mr Hann's dismissal.
Ms Anne Douglas, secretary of the joint trades union committee, said:
''Mr Hann has made an outstanding contribution.
''We are disappointed to hear that he will not be continuing in a
management position with SN.''
She added: ''There is a difficult period ahead with the Government's
privatisation plans and his experience will be missed.''

This is the full text of the message from James Hann to Scottish
Nuclear staff:
To all our staff,
IT is with a great deal of sadness that I am today announcing my
departure from Scottish Nuclear to you all.
I was asked and agreed to step down as chairman in order that the
senior executive team which will be in place at the time of
privatisation will have the right balance of skills and age profile for
the longer term. Robin Jeffrey will take my place as chairman and in
addition to this role he will become a deputy chairman on the holding
company board.
This is a difficult time. I have witnessed the tremendous growth of
the company over the past five years. My time here has been incredibly
rewarding in both a personal and a professional sense. The company has,
I believe, come of age in the run up to privatisation and I have no
doubt that with all of your skills, dedication and hard work, Scottish
Nuclear will be an extremely successful organisation in the private
sector.
I am saddened that I will not see the completion of a number of the
projects with which I have been personally involved. I believe TOP
(target outstanding performance)has been and will continue to be a great
galvanising force and am proud to have been associated with its
introduction. My involvement with the Come and See programme has also
been particularly rewarding, as we have now seen thousands of visitors
at Torness and Hunterston and a far greater awareness amongst the public
of the place for nuclear power in a balanced energy framework.
Equally the company's partnership with the charity Fairbridge and our
close association with the Spirit of Scotland have given me great
personal satisfaction. The vessel is currently taking part in the Tall
Ships race crewed by both Scottish Nuclear and Fairbridge trainees
something which I think serves as a fitting testimony to what can be
achieved when business and charity organisations work together.
I hope to speak to as many of you as possible before I leave in the
autumn but for all those who I may not see I would like to wish you
every possible success in your future career with this tremendous
company.
James Hann.

A FLYING training operation which began 33 years ago in modest
premises on an apron at Edinburgh Airport, and later operated from
nearby RAF Turnhouse, was yesterday celebrating a move into new
accommodation.
Edinburgh Air Centre, the first Scots operation to offer the Scottish
Vocational Qualification scheme, with tax relief incentives for those
undertaking this route towards a commercial pilot's licence, is now
located near the General Aviation Terminal.
The centre, with a fleet of 16 Cessna aircraft and 450 members,
believes the move will facilitate expansion of services. Since taking
over four years ago, managing director John Easson has promoted steady
development.
Now on offer are pilot training courses for the Private Licence
through to the Commercial Licence and Instrument Rating, all approved by
the Civil Avaiation Authority.

A BOY of 16 from Lower Sandwick, near Stornoway, was drowned last
night after he slipped and fell while rock fishing near Holm Point at
the entrance to Stornoway Harbour.
He had been fishing along with a friend. His companion tried to grab
him, but he was carried away in the swell and currents.
The car ferry Suilven, which was approaching Stornoway, was late in
berthing because she was asked to stand by until the lifeboat arrived.
Two divers were called to search ledges.
The body, as yet not named, was recovered a short time later.

SCOTTISH Industry Minister George Kynoch tried to deflect criticism of
Mr Hann's shock dismissal by emphasising the strong Scottish presence in
the new nuclear company.
He said a short leet of suitable buildings for holding company
headquarters in Scotland had been identified, and that further
appointments to the holding company board, to be made shortly, would
''underline the Government's commitment to a continuing strong Scottish
presence and influence in the holding company.''
Mr Kynoch added: ''The Government remains committed to maintaining a
strong nuclear presence in Scotland, reflected both in the continuation
of Scottish Nuclear as an independent subsidiary company and the
establishment of the new holding company, registered and based in
Scotland.
''There will be a substantial headquarters in Scotland employing a
significant number of people on UK-wide functions.''

Margaret Vaughan profiles the maverick who has been run out of
Scottish Nuclear and Cameron Simpson gauges the reaction
JAMES Hann didn't see it coming. The bullet entered, unexpectedly,
from the back. Perhaps he should have. He had, after all, defied the
conventional wisdom that says when the political piper calls the tune,
the head of soon to-be-privatised industries dance a merry jig and reap
the pickings.
Instead, he was outspoken in his view that outright privatisation of
the nuclear industry would wreck it.
As part-time chairman of Scottish Nuclear he warned that private
investors would be unwilling to fund the hugely costly long-term
projects involved in the industry. Without a partnership with the public
sector, it would blow the chance to develop the industry.
Hann admits to a very sharp tongue. And he has no tendency to curb it
where he is driven by his convictions to speak out.
He believes that the coal industry was wrecked. It would be a tragedy,
he has said, to see the nuclear industry blown in the same way. These
were honest words but not words to gladden the hearts of a Government
intent on getting shot of the lot.
While favouring its privatisation to get away from constraints on
commercial freedom, Hann cautioned: ''The key objective must be the
survival of the industry, the retention of the nuclear option; not its
privatisation or otherwise.''
It was an echo of an earlier formidable attack, in 1991, when he said
Government policy left energy decisions to market forces when what was
needed was a national energy plan.
It was his recurring theme. And it did not endear him to Ian Lang,
then Scottish Secretary. But then James Hann is not one to keep his head
down. Never has been.
During national service in the Royal Artillery, he was ''returned to
regiment'' half-way through an officer training course. His commanding
officers concluded he lacked leadership ability. Why? Because he
questioned many of the petty, often downright stupid things he was
ordered to do. And because he answered back.
It is a trait that has persisted. And not one that he regrets.
According Robin Jeffrey (the man who will now sit in his chair, a man
whom Hann recruited as chief executive) Hann has an in-built bullshit
detector. He also described his erstwhile boss as a pluralist, a very
gifted communicator. But not, clearly, of the message the Government
wanted to hear from the man they appointed to the industry.
Hann was hired by the Scottish Office in April 1990 to chair the newly
created Scottish Nuclear company. It was also a role few would have
relished. Nor was he an obvious choice. He had spent 18 years with dairy
giant Unigate, followed by 14 years running Seaforth Maritime, the
highly successful oil industry service and supply company, out of
Aberdeen.
Scottish Nuclear was in for a shock. He picked it up by its shabby
lapels and shook it. ''When I came, I found deeply ingrained traditional
nuclear industry thinking, not industrial thinking,'' Hann has said. ''I
knew deep down that had to change if nuclear power was to be
competitive.''
So he questioned everything. When the answers came, he asked for
alternative solutions. The then chief executive was let go and for nine
months, Hann did both jobs.
It helped that he inherited the UK's most efficient nuclear reactors.
But his formidable energy and intuitive style helped shape progressive
improvements in its trading performance. Scottish Nuclear has converted
a loss of #33m into a profit of #72m over its last four financial years.
More significantly, the company reduced the unit cost of generation from
3.22p to 2.83p, establishing nuclear power as a more competitive energy
source.
Hann sought to extend plants' operating lives to spread the fixed
costs. At the same time he wanted to prolong the decommissioning
programme.
He brought in Jeffrey as chief executive, a Scot who had joined
Babcock and Wilcox from school in 1956 and who joined the SSEB in 1979
to head the team that built Torness. Hann was impressed. His was the
technical know-how. Hann's was the business head.
They made, by all accounts, a formidable team: Hann, scuttling around
the East Kilbride offices in his cardigan, working in tandem with
Jeffrey whose intimate knowledge of nuclear power was combined with the
advantages of a commercial background.
It puzzles close colleagues that at the age of 61, with a long list of
business achievements behind him, Hann remains like a man seeking to
prove himself. He is a reserved man but not remote. Easy to talk to and
direct, he was respected -- even liked -- by staff.
Colleagues are not entertained regularly at home. He likes to keep a
friendly distance from those he might have to bollock next day. He never
goes to a pub. Does not have a big circle of friends.
His original salary of around #39,000 was raised temporarily when he
was running the company. But he could command several times that amount
in the private sector. He is clearly not motivated by money alone.
Not that he will starve. He has other lucrative irons in the fire. His
lifestyle is comfortable. Home is a modern four-bedroom house looking
out to sea in Dunbartonshire, reflecting Hann's enduring love.
He once admitted: ''I feel lonelier in the middle of London than I do
on my boat in the middle of nowhere.''
What motivates him is not clear. ''There are those who go through life
and simply get to the end, and there are those who go through life and
make things happen. My grandfather and father were like that and that's
what I'm doing too,'' he has said.
Hann was born in Southampton, the eldest son of a local dairyman. He
was, by his own description, an angry young man. His father died
intestate at the age of 49. Hann, then 17, had to abandon his schooling
and shelve all hope of joining the Navy.
He had been dragooned into helping run the business as a child during
the war years. His father refused to countenance his plans for a career
at sea. So he moved in to run the dairy business from a factory behind
the terraced house where he was brought up. But death duties and an
enforced three-year stint doing national service cost the family the
business.
Three years later the firm, which employed 110 people was sold to
United Dairies, now Unigate. He went to work for them and stayed 18
years.
Now, once again, he finds himself ''returned to regiment'' when he
expected to remain in the nuclear officers ranks for some time yet. He
had no reason not to, given the impressive performance of the industry
he led. Except that, now as then, he was perhaps too lippy, too
unwilling to do as he was told.
Was it an act of revenge, then, that Hann should be deposed from the
post he has held for five years? Or simply evidence that Scottish
Nuclear is, as feared and despite the honeyed words of reassurance
murmured by Mr Lang, being absorbed into Nuclear Electric? Who knows.
What is certain is that when Mr Hann was summoned to London on Tuesday
he had no inkling the freshly incarnated Mr Lang, as Trade and Industry
Secretary, had signed his P45.
There is perhaps one other certainty. That Mr Hann still does not
regret the trait that makes him speak his mind -- then or now.

THE first general meeting of Scottish Milk yesterday saw a leadership
takeover.
The producers' co-operative, which has taken over the role of the
Scottish Milk Marketing Board, had 200 members at the meeting in Glasgow
expecting Lanarkshire farmer Jim Brown, the deputy chairman, to step
into the shoes of retiring chairman Andrew Howie.
However, after praising the 15 years of work done by Mr Howie, he sat
down and surprised dairy farmers were read a statement from Mr Brown,
which said: ''As of today, I am resigning from Scottish Milk. The knives
of the past week can now be withdrawn from my back and I shall feel a
little more comfortable.
''My reason for resignation is that I find myself in an untenable
position as the result of the actions of my fellow directors.''
Later, he explained he had campaigned for the chairmanship and
believed that he had almost total support from the other eight
directors. However, within the last few days, the man he had planned on
appointing as his deputy, Mr John Duncan, from Maybole, Ayrshire,
emerged as a challenger for the top post.
Mr Brown said: ''It was an impossible situation.'' He said he had been
criticised for being ''too close'' to Scottish Pride, the manufacturer
which is a major customer of Scottish Milk, and for being ''too harsh''
on the Dairy Trade Federation.
After a brief private meeting of the remaining directors, Mr Duncan
emerged as new chairman. His deputy is Mrs Evelyn Mundell, from
Whitehouse, in Kintyre.
Mr Duncan said: ''This was producer power being exercised.''
He said milk producers had decided they wanted a new way forward,
having undergone the change from a statutory milk marketing board to a
co-operative.
Mr Duncan, who farms 450 acres and 150 cows, has been on the board for
only two years. Mrs Mundell, who with husband Ben has 95 cows on their
280-acre farm, has been on the board for eight years and is a former
chairman of the Scottish Dairy Council.
Mr Howie, who has steered the change from milk board to co-operative,
said its operation was achieving realistic milk prices for producers.

THE Prince of Wales will never again fly an aircraft of the Queen's
Flight following his disastrous crash-landing on Islay last year.
However, although Prince Charles was at the controls when the BAe 146
overshot the runway and ended up in boggy ground, the captain of the
aircraft was yesterday blamed for the accident and as a consequence can
no longer carry on as an instructor pilot.
The RAF had suggested to Buckingham Palace that the prince should
undergo intensive retraining, including simulator flights on a BAe 146.
The suggestion indicated a degree of criticism over the prince's
skills as a pilot of this particular aircraft.
The crash could have cost the lives of the prince and the 10 others on
board at the time.
Although he completed his wings course as a young man, Prince Charles,
a group captain in the RAF, had never undergone refresher courses.
His father, who at the age of 74 still regularly takes over controls
of royal aircraft, has always made a point of undergoing retraining
courses every six months.
The Prince of Wales has not flown an RAF aircraft since the accident.
Yesterday, as a Ministry of Defence report into the accident severely
criticised Squadron Leader Graham Laurie, captain of the crashed
aircraft, and his navigator for negligence, the prince made it known he
would no longer take the controls of a royal aircraft.
''It is entirely a personal decision,'' a spokesman for the prince at
St James's Palace said.
Senior RAF officials were at pains to make it clear that Squadron
Leader Laurie was not being made a scapegoat.
''Between you and me, he is very fortunate that he has been allowed to
remain a member of 32 Squadron (the Queen's Flight),'' a senior officer
said.
He had flown with the prince for seven years and he should have
developed a good enough rapport with him to take over control without
any problem, it was suggested.
Although the pilot is still flying aircraft of the Queen's Flight, the
fact he can no longer act as an instructor means he cannot hand over
control of the aircraft to a host pilot. That had been the official role
of the prince when he failed to land the BAe 146 at Islay on June 29
last year.
The aircraft initially touched down on its nosewheels with 784 metres
of runway remaining. However, the mainwheels did not make firm contact
with the ground.
With only 509 metres of runway remaining, the aircraft finally settled
but it was too late for the activation of various braking systems.
The captain attempted to turn to the left on to a taxiway. However,
the nosewheels left the paved surface and sank into soft ground.
Because of his failure to intervene in the final stages of the
approach, the captain was negligent. The navigator, who had failed to
advise the captain of a tailwind and to draw his attention to inaccurate
approach perameters, was also deemed to be negligent.

THE Government was last night accused of settling a score by sacking
Mr James Hann, the chairman of Scottish Nuclear, who unsuccessfully
campaigned for the company to remain independent after privatisation.
The dismissal was condemned by opposition parties and trade unions.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's industry spokesman, summed up the general
feeling with one word -- ''contemptible''.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Hann had paid the price for putting
his trust in former Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Lang and
standing up for Scottish Nuclear's independence.
Mr Adam Ingram, Labour MP for East Kilbride, where SN has its
headquarters, said the decision to dismiss Mr Hann could only be
interpreted as a vindictive action on the part of Mr Lang.
Mr George Robertson, Shadow Scottish Secretary, said Mr Hann had made
a commercial and safety success of SN but he had now been ''cast aside
in the mad rush to sell off the nuclear reactors''.
The trade unions in SN, who are opposing the privatisation plans, said
they were saddened at Mr Hann's dismissal. Anne Douglas, secretary of
the joint trade union committee, said: ''There is a difficult period
ahead with the Government's privatisation plans and his experience will
be missed.''
Mr Hann, 62, was asked to quit as the Government appointed executives
to a holding company that will lead Scottish Nuclear and its English
counterpart, Nuclear Electric, into privatisation as a joint concern
next year.
''I was asked and agreed to stand down as chairman in the autumn,'' Mr
Hann said in a written statement.
But last night, he spoke of his ''surprise'' and '' great sadness'' on
learning that he was to leave Scottish Nuclear.
Speaking at his home at Rhu, Dunbartonshire, he said: ''The decision
took me by surprise, for sure. I only learned yesterday from Mr Robb,
the chairman designate of the UK nuclear holding company, after being
summoned to a meeting in London.
''I didn't suspect for a minute that my resigning was on the agenda.
The company (Scottish Nuclear) is running like a dream and we have
beaten all the targets asked of us quite comfortably.''
Mr Hann said it had been explained to him that the company was looking
at the balance of the skills and age profile and that the new merged
company would be looking for people with at least five years' working
life ahead of them. It had been pointed out that this was what
institutional investors would want to see in the prospectus of the new
company.
He said: ''Of the four key people at Scottish Nuclear I am the oldest
at 62, but I feel as fit as a fiddle.''
Mr Hann's opposition to the nuclear merger proposals and the
Government's energy policy has been well documented, although he would
not be drawn yesterday on criticising the Government announcements on
key positions at the UK nuclear holding company.
Neither would he criticise Mr Lang.
From Southampton originally, he has lived in Scotland since 1972, and
is also chairman of the Yorkshire-based chemical company, Hickson
International, and a non-executive director of the chemical company
William Baird and the insurance company, NFU Mutual and Avon Group.
He said: ''When the Scottish Nuclear role is over there will be no
other task for me north of the Border other than my voluntary role as
commissioner of the Northern Lighthouse Board.
''It will probably mean having to leave the company, our home, and
Scotland which has become my homeland and a place I and my family love
dearly. I will have to look for something to replace my duties at
Scottish Nuclear.''
Although he was on a four-year contract when he became chairman in
1990, this has now reverted to a one-year ''rolling contract''.
It has been agreed that he should step down from his position as
chairman of Scottish Nuclear on September 30. He said severance terms or
a ''golden handshake'' had still to be agreed.
Mr John Robb, the chairman-designate of new UK nuclear electric
holding company, said yesterday he had sought Mr Hann's removal to bring
more technical expertise and younger blood on to the board.
The final decision to sack Mr Hann was taken by Ian Lang in both his
former capacity as Scottish Secretary and his new role as President of
the Board of Trade.
Robin Jeffrey, 56, the chief executive of Scottish Nuclear, will take
over as chairman of the company when Mr Hann steps down on October 1. He
retains the joint title of chief executive.
The chairmen of Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric automatically
become vice chairmen of the holding company headed by Mr Robb that will
lead the nuclear power industry into privatisation.
Mr Robb, who was chairman of the pharmaceuticals company Glaxo before
its takeover by Wellcome earlier this year, denied that Mr Hann was
being sacked for political reasons.
''The only considerations in my mind were getting the right balance in
the technical qualifications and getting a more youthful element on the
board,'' he said.
Mr Robb, at 59, is only three years younger than Mr Hann.
During his five years at Scottish Nuclear, Mr Hann pulled the company
out of the red, reducing electricity generating costs on the way.
Scottish Nuclear, which supplies about half of Scotland's electricity
from its power stations at Torness near Dunbar and Hunterston on the
Clyde, made a profit of #150m in the last year up, after showing a loss
of #33m in 1990/91, its first year of operation.
The Government also announced the appointment yesterday of three other
executive directors to the new parent company for the UK nuclear
electric industry, which was set up in May.
Mr Robert Hawley, 59, the chief executive of Nuclear Electric, becomes
chief executive of the holding company, which has been dubbed HOLDCO.
Mr Michael Kirwan, 53, the finance director of Nuclear Electric,
becomes finance director and Mr Robert Armour, the secretary of Scottish
Nuclear, becomes company secretary.
The company's chief executive and finance director, with a support
staff of 40 to 50, will be based in Edinburgh.
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch tried to deflect criticism of
Mr Hann's dismissal by emphasising the strong Scottish presence in the
new nuclear company.
He said a short leet of suitable buildings for headquarters in
Scotland had been identified, and that further appointments to the
holding company board would ''underline the Government's commitment to a
continuing strong Scottish presence and influence in the holding
company.''

More trouble looms for travellers from both the bosses and the
workers.
A DECISION to plump for a revolutionary transmission-based signalling
system for the west coast main line could lead to ''unacceptable''
delays of up to 10 years in modernising Britain's principal InterCity
route, according to an all-party Commons committee.
Another of the many concerns highlighted in a hard-hitting report on
railway finances suggests that taxpayers may have to fork out as much as
#700m a year more for privatised railways than they did when the network
was fully in the public domain.
The Tory-dominated Commons Transport Committee voiced a whole list of
worries which Labour transport spokesman Henry McLeish said cast doubt
over almost every aspect of the Government's rail privatisation
programme.
It represented an excellent overview of the deep crisis which had
affected the rail industry, said Mr McLeish, adding that the
privatisation was being driven by dogma alone.
''How else could the Government justify writing off #600,000 of our
money every year, without promising a single extra train, service or
station,'' he asked.
Stressing that renewal of the west coast line was urgent, the
committee concluded that reliance on an as yet unproven train control
system -- in which cab radio equipment replaces traditional track-side
signals -- could lead to unacceptable delays. It might be 10 years
before the system could be developed, proved, and installed.
Modernisation of the west coast line, which the Government had
confirmed remained a priority, would be a test of the effectiveness and
efficiency of the newly-structured railway and particularly of the
franchising director, in securing private finance to improve the
condition of railway assets without undue delay.
A Railtrack spokesman later agreed that the #2000m-plus modernisation
programme would take 10 years and added that tenders were already being
invited for the #30m to #50m contract to develop the transmission-based
cab control system and should be let out by the end of the year. It
would put the line at the forefront of technology, allow greater
frequency of services, and greatly reduced maintenance costs.
On the question of state subsidy, the committee points out that in
1993-94, before pre-privatisation restructuring, the cost of grants to
the taxpayer was #1073m a year.
However, by 1997-98, this figure is likely to rise to between #1560m
and #1760m.
''Hence the privatisation process appears likely to result in an
increase in public funding of about #500m to #700m. Assuming that the
level and quality of services remains substantially unchanged, we
question whether (such) an increase . . . can be justified,'' said the
committee.
Among the other concerns were:
* Franchising -- The committee recommends that British Rail, which has
been excluded from franchises to date, should always be invited to bid
for passenger franchises;
* PTE funding -- The report says it would regrettable if uncertainty
caused by the new system of funding PTE rail services caused the level
of those services to decline;
* BR service levels -- The report said they may be lower in 1997-98
and MPs said if that was the case the Comptroller and Auditor General
should immediately examine the whole franchising policy;
* Passenger service requirements -- These establish the absolute
minimum number of trains operators must run but the committee said the
PSR did not necessarily guarantee services in all circumstances. It
recommended bidders for private lines be told that any attempt to reduce
services would amount to a breach of contract;
* Signalling work -- The Railway Industry Association told MPs the
network was managed by a bewildering variety of equipment, some dating
to the last century. MPs expressed concern at the gap between what the
equipment manufacturers said was being spent on signalling and what
Railtrack said;
* Scrapping of loss-making lines -- MPs said their axing would be
acceptable only if the money saved was used to support other services or
the amount of subsidy paid to the railways was reduced. ''What would be
unacceptable would be for the same amount of subsidy to buy fewer rail
services,'' they said;
* Railtrack's plans -- Railtrack should publish its 10-year strategy
as soon as possible, said the report. Its failure to do so had
''seriously hampered'' a proper assessment of Railtrack's investment
needs. According to Railtrack, that document is now with the Department
of Transport.

THE West Highland sleeper's prospects for survival brightened
yesterday following a round of meetings between Mr Michael Forsyth and
the men who hold the sleeper's fate in their hands.
Although no breakthrough was achieved, the Scottish Secretary's
meetings with the Transport Secretary, the chairman of British Rail, the
director of ScotRail, and the franchising director served to encourage
the impression that Mr Forsyth plans an aggressive campaign to defend
the service.
Yesterday, Mr Forsyth also criticised the rail union Aslef for its
series of strikes over pay. The effect of each one-day strike, which
results in two nights' service lost, proves ''Aslef is determined to
reduce the viability of the service'', he said.
Despite cautioning against raising expectations, Mr Forsyth is keen to
pursue every avenue in search of what he describes as ''a way forward''
before the sleeper's summer programme expires in September.
A number of options are being explored that would allow ScotRail to
run a sleeper service to Fort William for less subsidy.
Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director, announced late last year that
he was unwilling to subsidise the London to Fort William sleeper service
and had decided not to include it ScotRail's Passenger Service
Requirement.
BR subsequently announced it was suspending the service but was forced
to backtrack after the High Court found it had failed to follow the
proper consultation procedure.
In a statement after the meetings, Mr Forsyth said: ''My discussions
today were very constructive. In the light of his consultation on the
draft ScotRail PSR, the franchising director is considering a number of
options for incorporating a sleeper service to Fort William in the
PSR.''
Attention will focus on Mr Forsyth's subsequent meetings with
Transport Secretary Sir George Young, who will make the final decision
whether to grant extra money to Mr Salmon in order to keep the
loss-making service running.
Mr Forsyth has the option of funding the sleeper out of the Scottish
Office budget but is understood to be reluctant to take money away from
essential services to underwrite the sleeper. Sir George is said to be
''sensitive and understanding'' to the position north of the border.
Meanwhile, ScotRail's director of corporate affairs, Mr John Boyle,
said yesterday that the cost of running the Fort William sleeper
currently stood at #2.6m but that could be reduced substantially.
Mr Boyle said ScotRail had been working away in the background and had
come up with some ideas on how to reduce costs on the threatened
service.
Mr Boyle was in Inverness to help launch a #200,000 campaign to double
ScotRail's business in the Highlands, whose main focus will be the Far
North Line to Wick and Thurso and the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.
This follows the promotion of the West Highland Line last year, which
had seen ScotRail increase its business there by 50%.

<HEADLINE>British 'heartbreak' over rail sell-off, claims Kinnock</HEADLINE>

EUROPEAN Transport Commissioner, Mr Neil Kinnock, yesterday claimed
the British people were ''heartbroken'' at the way their railway
industry was being privatised.
He was holding up the British sell-off as an example of what should
never happen to Europe's rail network.
Launching the latest stage in the European Commission's plan to make
rail travel more popular by coaxing freight and passengers off the
roads, he said the British experience of rail privatisation was that it
was a shambles.
Commission proposals were intended to make the railways of Europe more
competitive, safer, more efficient, and environmentally and socially
responsible, Mr Kinnock said.
He produced figures showing that Britain's railways carried only 8.7%
of the freight market, the fourth lowest in the EU, and that British
passenger trains had only 4.6% of the market, the lowest share in the EU
after Ireland.
The Commission takes a neutral view of who owns a modernised EU
railway network. ''The British have chosen privatisation but that is not
necessarily the model for the rest of Europe,'' a Commission official
said.
The EU wants an integrated transport market with more cross-border
high-speed trains and more research carried out into what travellers
want from the rail network.
Commissioners, already overseeing plans by many EU member states to
invest billions of pounds in trans-European rail routes, are worried at
the continued decline in rail use. They want to attract fresh capital
for the industry by amending existing laws and liberalising the
industry.
Mr Kinnock was asked if his swipe at the privatisation of British Rail
was attributable to a Labour politician or a European Commissioner. He
said he was a British taxpayer whose interest was an efficient railway
throughout the EU.
''I see myself as one of the huge majority of people who are
heartbroken at what has been done to the railway industry in Britain,''
he said. ''It is a shambles.''
He added that the taxpayer would have to pay more in subsidies and
felt the privatisation programme had obviously not be properly thought
out. For this reason, it would not attract business from road to rail.
''Apart from that, I suppose it's all right,'' he said.
The Commissioner said that liberalising international passenger
services would not affect commuter services and the ordinary travelling
public within national boundaries.

A GROUP of MPs is to seek an urgent meeting with the Transport
Secretary in a bid to change Government plans to hand the building of a
new air traffic control centre at Prestwick to the private sector.
The move comes after Sir Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil
Aviation Authority, described the plan to build the #200m centre under
the Private Funding Initiative as inappropriate and unacceptable.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, has been
joined by his Labour colleagues in Ayrshire in seeking the meeting with
Sir George Young to urge him to change his mind.
Mr Foulkes said: ''The Government's plans that the new centre be
built, owned, and operated by the private sector have suffered a
shattering blow by Chris Chataway speaking out.
''In the light of what are unprecedented remarks, I have made a new
approach to the Secretary of State for Transport with my Ayrshire
colleagues and demand that the situation be rectified.''
Meanwhile, Sir Christopher said at Prestwick before a monthly meeting
of the CAA board that four consortia had shown interest in the project
and the CAA was about to issue invitations to tender.

THE intervention of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth could help keep
in Scotland the work of the closure-threatened Torry Food Science
Laboratory in Aberdeen.
In the Commons, Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg confirmed that
Torry, known as FSLT, would close in 1996. However, in a written answer
to Tayside North MP Bill Walker, he added: ''I will make a further
announcement soon on the consequential changes for the work currently
undertaken by the laboratory.''
It appears that what Mr Forsyth has managed to persuade Mr Hogg to do
is reconsider whether the functions of the laboratory should be moved to
York or be dispersed around other Scottish centres.
It is understood that on Tuesday the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries
and Food was poised to announce the ratification of the closure decision
announced last month, and the rejection of alternative proposals drawn
up by a special task force. Then Mr Forsyth intervened.
The task force, headed by Professor Hugh Pennington of Aberdeen
University's department of microbiology, was set up when the former
Agriculture Minister, Mr William Waldegrave, granted Torry a 30-day
extension to prepare a rescue plan in the face of extreme public
pressure.
The 50-page report was handed in by the North-east's MPs including Mr
Raymond Robertson, in whose constituency it lies.
Professor Pennington said he believed they had established an
''unassailable'' scientific case for the retention of the FSLT, and had
put forward strong economic arguments.
It is understood that the task force recommended that the functions of
the laboratory, and its 100 staff, should be dispersed between the
nearby Marine Laboratory, the Rowett Research Institute on the outskirts
of Aberdeen, and Aberdeen University, rather than be transferred to a
new ''super lab'' in York as proposed.
Mr Forsyth is understood to have asked his Scottish Office officials
to provide for the task force whatever help is required in supporting
its case, and has indicated his desire to ensure that the final decision
should benefit the taxpayers and that Scotland should not lose out.
The intervention by Mr Forsyth was welcomed yesterday by the Institute
of Professionals, Managers and Specialists. The union had expected Mr
Hogg to announce on Tuesday that he had dismissed the alternative plan.
Mr David Luxton, national officer, said: ''Any intervention by Michael
Forsyth to protect Scottish science and retain quality jobs in Aberdeen
is to be welcomed.''
Mr Luxton travelled from London yesterday to address the laboratory
staff.
''The Torry laboratory has a proud international reputation for
scientific excellence which will be lost forever if the new Agriculture
Minister endorses his predecessor's plan to close the lab and move most
of it to York,'' he said.
''The all-party campaign to save Torry has the support of most
Conservative MPs in Scotland. The Torry decision is seen as the first
test of the new Scottish Secretary's influence over his Cabinet
colleagues and his ability to protect Scottish interests.''
The European Parliament's research, energy, and technology committee
is seeking an explanation from the Government as to why its concerns
about the proposed closure of the FSLT have not been addressed.

THE showdown over rail pay intensified yesterday, writes Roy Rogers,
with the Rail, Maritime and Transport union deciding to re-ballot its
400 BR drivers in protest at bonus offers made to striking Aslef
drivers.
Subject to that ballot result they could join the fifth Aslef stoppage
scheduled for August 25, putting a stop to even the minimal services --
such as those between Glasgow and Ayr -- run by BR on strike days.
RMT drivers are furious that BR has floated the idea of future bonuses
of up to #200 for Aslef drivers while refusing to discuss any
improvement on the ''final'' 3% offer for them.
Meanwhile Aslef drivers employed on London Underground Ltd (LUL) are
to stage a series of five one-day stoppages over pay after rejecting
their ''final'' 2.75% offer.
RMT members have already done the same and London's Tube system is
scheduled to be paralysed next Thursday to coincide with the next strike
by Aslef's BR drivers.
Aslef's strike schedule for BR involves stoppages on July 27, August 8
and 25, and September 12.
Aslef's Tube strikes, following a 1025 to 322 vote, are timetabled for
July 27, August 3, 8, and 25, and September 12. RMT members employed by
LUL are expected to strike on the same days.
Talks aimed at averting the Tube strikes broke down last night after
75 minutes, with LUL managing director Denis Tunnicliffe saying his
position on pay had not changed.
Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of Aslef, said his Tube members were
''totally frustrated'' at the below inflation 2.75% offer, which would
add #11m to LUL's pay bill.
The Underground drivers wanted to stage one strike on their own -- the
one set for August 3 -- to illustrate their strength of feeling.

A DESPERATE plan involving massive air strikes to prevent Gorazde
becoming the next UN protected enclave falling into Serb hands was being
drawn up last night before a crucial conference in London.
Tomorrow's meeting of foreign and defence Ministers, which could see
the beginning of the end of UN participation in Bosnia, was made even
more urgent last night when the advancing Serbs claimed the fall of
Zepa.
''Zepa has surrendered,'' said a statement issued by Bosnian Serb
military headquarters. It added that representatives of Zepa's mostly
Muslim population accepted surrender conditions at a meeting with
Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic.
The Serbs expelled about 30,000 Muslims from the nearby Srebrenica
enclave after seizing it last week.
Gorazde is the last of the UN areas in eastern Bosnia, and next in
line for General Mladic, who has pledged to overrun it. It is defended
by 200 British troops, in a force of 300 UN peacekeepers, and adds
desperate urgency to Mr Major's efforts.
Last night, the Prime Minister was at the centre of intense diplomatic
activity. Mr Major spoke with US President Bill Clinton for 35 minutes
by telephone in what was described as a ''thorough'' discussion on the
possible options.
Mr Major, Mr Clinton, and French President Jacques Chirac were said to
be close to agreement that air attack was the safest option for UN
troops.
However, it was clear that a plan to airlift 1000 French soldiers into
Gorazde in American helicopters was a poor second option to save the
next UN protected area from coming under Serb attack.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, meanwhile, was continuing his visit
to Washington, where he has had a long discussion on the crisis with
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Mr Rifkind is expected to return
to London in time to brief the Cabinet's overseas and defence committee
in advance of this morning's full Cabinet meeting.
In Washington, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Mr Clinton had
asked him to delay the Senate vote on lifting the Bosnia arms embargo
until next week, a move which would put off action until after the
London meeting. Mr Dole said he would consider it.
In the Commons emergency debate on Bosnia, Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo underlined the risks of escalating the conflict if Nato
airpower were used against the Serbs. He said if the UN tried to
reinforce Gorazde by helicopter there would have to be massive
pre-emptive airstrikes to neutralise the Serb air defences.
However, French sources indicated the West was likely to threaten air
strikes to defend Gorazde and to send more British troops to keep open a
supply route to Sarajevo. The sources said a battalion of British troops
would be transferred to Sarajevo to help the French secure and keep open
a relief supply route over Mount Igman into the Bosnian capital.
They said the compromise plan would be announced at tomorrow's meeting
which will bring together Foreign and Defence Ministers of the
five-power Contact Group -- Britain, the US, Russia, France, and Germany
-- along with senior EU, UN, and Nato officials.
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said: ''We can no longer accept
seeing scenes like those we saw at Srebrenica. France will therefore
propose to its Western allies an operation to allow security to be
maintained in Gorazde.''
The three leaders are intent on presenting a united front at the
conference. They have little confidence that air attack alone would
prevent Gorazde falling to the Serbs should they push into the town,
which has a population of 85,000.
However, it is felt that flying troops in to support the Welch
Fusiliers based in Gorazde would send out a strong message to Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. He might stop and think that the UN was no
longer bluffing and was prepared to fight over this enclave.
Mr Karadzic appeared to indicate last night that Gorazde was his main
aim. According to a TV interview with Sir David Frost he has proposed
the government trade the enclave for territory in Sarajevo as part of a
peace deal. But he also demanded 56% of Bosnian territory for Bosnian
Serbs, that they be allowed to have their own state, and that Sarajevo
must be split into ''two neighbouring cities,'' one for Bosnian Serbs
and one for Muslims.
What was clear last night was that there was no easy options for the
UN and Nato allies.
The military chiefs had drawn up the options. However, their preferred
plan of using air power was now down to the political will of the
leaders of the various nations involved.
The fall of Gorazde could be the last straw for UN operations in the
area.

A NEW loyalist organisation which is threatening to take action
against the Catholic community in Northern Ireland if attacks on
Protestant property are not halted, was last night condemned by the RUC.
The previously unheard of Protestant Defence Force said it would
''strike hard'' at the Catholic community if there were any more
attacks.
In a statement to a local radio station, an anonymous caller said:
''This is the newly-formed Protestant Defence Force. Any further attacks
on Protestant, loyalist, or unionist halls, schools, or businesses of
any sort, and we will strike hard at the Catholic community. This
warning will come into effect at 12 midnight tonight.''
Details of the threat -- a codeword was given for future calls -- were
passed to the RUC, whose spokesman said: ''Any statement made in the
present climate which does anything to heighten community concern must
be condemned out of hand.''
The force re-emphasised its determination to put a stop to sectarian
attacks and appealed for calm.
Mr Gary McMichael, leader of the loyalist Ulster Democratic Party,
said there was concern that the new organisation could threaten the
ceasefire and warned it that the loyalist paramilitary leadership would
not easily forgive it.
He said the Combined Loyalist Military Command -- the umbrella
organisation for terrorist groups -- had said on July 7 that ''the
entire population of Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the Irish
Republic, and America would not easily forgive any group which
undermines the peace process or precipitates a return to war''.
''I think that speaks for itself,'' he said.
Meanwhile, a fire-raising attack on an Orange Hall at Crumlin, County
Antrim, which badly damaged the building, was being investigated by
police.
It was the latest in a series of attacks on Orange Halls and
Protestant homes and businesses over the past fortnight, which unionist
politicians have blamed on the IRA and have said is the start of a
rolling return to violence.
Ulster Unionist security spokesman Ken Maginnis said recently that the
IRA leadership had effectively ended its 11-month-old ceasefire and had
earmarked ways of putting the blame on others -- the Government for
intransigence and loyalists for attacking Catholics.
Meanwhile, the Government last night was set to resume the transfer of
terrorist prisoners from English to Northern Irish jails, in a bid to
stop an escalation of the dirty protest.
Four Republican prisoners are now involved in the prison protest and
more are threatening to join it.

A MAN who plied an 11-year-old boy with drink then raped him was
jailed for seven years yesterday.
David Flynn, 27, of Auchinleck, Ayrshire, admitted assaulting the boy
when he appeared at the High Court in Glasgow.
Mr Michael O'Grady, prosecuting, said that Flynn was living with a
friend at Stoner Crescent, Auchinleck, when the boy called at the door.
The boy was invited in and plied with cider.
He fell asleep on a chair in the living room, and when he woke, rolled
on to the floor and was sick. Flynn put him on a settee and removed his
tracksuit trousers and underpants.
The boy fell asleep again, and when he woke for the second time saw
Flynn with no clothes on. When the child began to cry, Flynn twisted a
pillow case round his neck and tried to throttle him.
Eventually Flynn let go the pillow case, then put the boy through a
horrific sex ordeal, making him perform indecent acts before having sex
with him.
Passing sentence, Lord Clyde told Flynn that his crimes were
appalling.

A YOUNG girl drowned in a fish tank in her bedroom only a week after
she was rescued when she fell into the garden pond.
Alice Hamer, who was 23 months old, fell head first into the aquarium,
which was just nine inches deep, and was unable to pull herself out.
Her parents, Claire and David Hamer, yesterday were being comforted at
their home in Harvesting Lane, Oxenbourne, near Petersfield, Hampshire.
Mrs Hamer, 29, found Alice when she went to wake her and dialled 999.
Her husband had already left for his job as a sales manager for British
Telecom.
Paramedics battled to save Alice for more than two hours but were
unable to revive her.
The tragedy came just a week after Mrs Hamer had rescued her daughter
from drowning in their garden pool. She dragged her from the water and
rushed her to hospital, where Alice recovered.
A close family friend, who asked not to be named, said: ''Claire has
been through such an awful lot -- she was quite heavily pregnant until
only a few weeks ago.
''But she suffered her second miscarriage and then this happened.''
Detective Inspector Dave Collins, of Alton police, said: ''It is a
terrible tragedy.
''Alice managed to climb up on a chair and remove the lid from the
aquarium, which was on a stool, and somehow fell in.
''She had the top part of her body in the fish tank and was not able
to remove herself. Her mum went into the bedroom at about 7.45am to wake
Alice up and found her in the tank.
''She tried to resuscitate the baby and when the ambulancemen arrived
they spent a couple of hours trying to save her life. Alice was taken to
the Queen Alexandra Hospital, Cosham, but she was pronounced dead.''

<HEADLINE>Further curbs to end BSE threat</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT veterinary surgeons are to introduce new curbs at slaughter
houses because rules designed to wipe out the so-called mad cow disease
are not working properly.
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg yesterday announced a tightening of
the rules because feed potentially infected with Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) is leaking into the cattle food chain.
However, Mr Keith Meldrum, the Government's chief vet, said the move
was merely a ''fine tuning'' of existing regulations and stressed there
was still no known risk to humans.
Mr Hogg announced the tightening of the rules a week after a report on
BBC Radio 4 alleged that rules designed to stop the spread of BSE were
being broken at abattoirs.
The Food Commission, a leading consumer group, has already called for
an inquiry into why the rules were not working as effectively as they
were thought to be.
The major cause of BSE is thought to be the controversial practice of
feeding cattle, which are natural herbivores, on the recycled organs of
other cows.
The practice was banned by the Government in 1988, when the number of
reported cases of BSE was rising dramatically. However, around 20,000
cattle born since then have contracted the disease.
Mr Meldrum said it was thought all of them contracted BSE from feed
containing recycled contaminated organs.
Although he felt the regulations had proved 99% effective, Mr Meldrum
hoped the new rules, which aim to prevent specified bovine offal from
getting into cattle feed at slaughter houses, should plug any gaps. He
said owners could now expect to be watched very closely and prosecuted
if they are found guilty of breaking the ban.

TEN years of health warnings and tax increases have made no impact on
childhood smoking levels, the Government admitted yesterday.
The latest statistics, showing that as many under-16s smoke now as in
1986, provoked renewed demands for a ban on cigarette advertising and
sponsorship.
Figures released by the Department of Health showed that from 1993 to
1994 the proportion of youngsters aged 11 to 15 who smoked rose from 10%
to 12% -- the first time for 11 years that the figure had exceeded 10%.
The Scottish Health Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, admitted
disappointment over separate figures published for Scotland indicating
that, for young persons aged 12-24, the prevalence was 30% -- the same
as in 1986.
The target set in the Government's health promotion strategy,
Scotland's Health -- A Challenge To Us All, is 21% by the year 2000, a
figure which now looks increasingly remote.
Within this group, the figures from the latest OPCS survey on smoking
among secondary school children show that last year 12% of pupils aged
12-15 were regular smokers, the same percentage as in 1986.
Peer pressure, advertising, televised sports sponsorship, and
cigarette brand name marketing of clothes all cut more ice with
schoolchildren than tax hikes or health promotion, anti-smoking
campaigners claimed.
Labour's Scottish Health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, accused the
Government of failing to send out a clear message to young people.
''It is time the Government started to live up to the ideals they set
in their health targets. By not banning advertising they are seen to be
supportive of the tobacco industry, which has helped to fund the
Conservative Party,'' he said.
''Without a ban I do not think we will see a reduction. We are
committed to a ban.''
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association, said:
''This removes any last pretence that the Government's one-horse policy
on tobacco control, which relies on an annual tax increase on
cigarettes, is working.
''I find it disturbing that this disastrous news should be released on
the day that Parliament rises, to avoid embarrassing questions from MPs
in the House of Commons. It is particularly disturbing when we know the
Department of Health has had these figures for at least three weeks.
''But you can be sure that doctors will not be afraid to embarrass
anyone when exposing the damaging failure of the Government's smug and
cosy voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry.''
Ms Maureen Moore, director of Ash in Scotland, said that peer
pressure, direct advertising and sponsorship, and subliminal marketing
-- the use of brand names for fashion products, like Camel boots -- all
conspired to make smoking attractive to young people.
''This is an industry which kills its customers and has to keep
recruiting new ones,'' she pointed out.
Smoking among adults aged 25-65 has fallen from 40% in 1986 to 38% in
1992 (the latest available figures). A further reduction to 32% is
required by the year 2000 to meet the target.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''We are not convinced that a
statutory ban would have a dramatic effect on reducing smoking,
especially in comparison with other factors such as price and parental
influence.''
He said the latest UK voluntary agreement, published last December,
had strengthened controls in a number of key areas, in particular by
significantly reducing permitted levels of outdoor advertising and by
improving the size and impact of health warnings.
Other figures produced by Lord James yesterday as part of a progress
report on ''Scotland's Health'' were more positive, but indicated a lot
of progress needing to be made over the next four years.
Alcohol abuse: The General Household Survey for 1992 (the latest
available figures) indicated that 16% of the population over 18 were
drinking more than the recommended sensible weekly limits of 21 units
for men and 14 units for women. The target needed a drop to 12% and
continuing efforts were necessary if the desired reduction was to be
achieved, said Lord James.
Coronary heart disease: Provisional figures showed that the death rate
for people under 65 had dropped from 77 per 100,000 population in 1990
to 61 in 1994. The target for the year 2000 required a further reduction
to 46 per 100,000 population.
Cancer: Deaths among those under 65 had also declined from 104 per
100,000 population in 1986 to 95 per 100,000 in 1994. The target for the
year 2000 required a further drop to 88 deaths per 100,000 population.

A HEARTBROKEN sister yesterday bade farewell to her twin who died
after taking a cocktail of the drugs ecstasy and ''speed''.
Lara Young, 20, was overcome with emotion at the funeral of Julia
yesterday at Mortonhall Crematorium Chapel, Midlothian.
Friends, university lecturers, and student friends wept as they joined
the family at the service. Julia was on a computer course at The Robert
Gordon University, Aberdeen, when she made her first and fatal encounter
with drugs at a nightclub in the city.
Also present at the service were students and lecturers from Napier
University, Edinburgh, where Lara is studying for a business degree.
The sisters' parents, Jan, 48, and Jim, 51, of Penicuik, Midlothian,
hoped Julia's death would serve as a warning to people tempted to use
drugs.
Mrs Young, a management consultant, said: ''If it is a lesson to just
one young person, then some good will have come out of her death.''
She added: ''We have been so lucky to have had such a wonderful
daughter as Julia for 20 years. For that, we give our thanks.
''But her sister is devastated. Julia and Lara were completely tied to
each other.''
Mr Young, a civil servant, said: ''We are truly overwhelmed by the
immense warmth of reaction from everyone. We can't be more grateful for
the hundreds of messages of support and comfort.''
The mourners heard the Rev Bill Irving, of St Mungo's Parish Church,
Penicuik, speak of Julia's love, warmth, intelligence, and zest for
life, a life that was cruelly extinguished when she tried the drugs for
the first time at a night out with her sister at The Palace nightclub.
Julia slipped into unconsciousness and was taken to Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary, where doctors fought in vain for three days to save her as
her liver failed.

SCOTTISH-educated Adair Turner is to be the new director-general of
the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Turner succeeds Mr Howard
Davies, who is to be the new Deputy Governor of the Bank of England.
Mr Turner, 39, was born in Ipswich and brought up in Scotland, where
he attended Hutchesons' Grammar School, Glasgow, and Trinity College,
Glenalmond, before going to Cambridge University.
Mr Turner's experience of a broad range of industries was a major
factor in his selection. He takes over the #150,000 a year post on
September 19.
Mr Turner has worked for the McKinsey management consultancy
organisation since 1982, becoming a director last year. The industries
he has worked in include brewing and distilling, telecommunications,
biscuits, and hotels. He is currently responsible for the development of
McKinsey's banking practice in Eastern Europe.
CBI president Sir Bryan Nicholson said: ''Mr Turner's wide-ranging
experience across many different industries, his international work, and
his deep knowledge of business policy and strategy, give him the
perspective he needs for such an important position.''
Management consultancy appears to be a good background for a CBI
director-general, as Mr Davies and his predecessor Sir John Banham
worked for McKinsey.
Mr Turner was politically active in his youth, being a member of the
Young Tories until defecting to the Social Democrats in 1981. With seven
others, he issued a statement protesting against the Conservative
Party's abandonment of the ''breadth of vision of its leaders in the
fifties and sixties''.
However, he later lost interest and has not been a member of a
political party for a decade.
Asked how he saw the future of the CBI, Mr Turner said: ''I hope it
will continue to be as successful as it has been in the past as the
premier spokesperson for British business.''
At Cambridge, Mr Turner, who is married with two daughters, gained a
double first degree in history and economics. He was also president of
the Cambridge Union.
Speaking after his appointment was announced, Mr Turner said he would
continue Mr Davies' approach to the job. ''The CBI under Howard Davies'
leadership has been extremely effective in putting over the business
case across a wide range of issues -- I aim to continue that success,''
he said.
On his attitude towards Europe, Mr Turner said he was ''very happy
with the broad thrust of CBI policy . . . which is clearly committed to
Britain being in Europe, in the European Union and actively involved,
but very determined to use whatever influence we have to make sure that
the Europe which evolves is a free- market Europe rather than
bureaucratic.

THE much-criticised Child Support Agency has found another way to
upset people, according to a table of complaints published yesterday by
the Data Protection Registrar.
The CSA topped the list of complaints over the handling of personal
information on computer, only a day after it was criticised by financial
watchdogs for getting more than half its maintenance assessments wrong.
Registrar Elizabeth France said 7% of the 2814 complaints she received
last year were about the CSA, making it the biggest single source of
complaints.
She said she had urged the CSA and the Government to take into account
concerns about the way the agency releases information.
Many of the complaints are about the way in which financial
information on new partners of absent fathers is being disclosed to
former partners by the CSA.
