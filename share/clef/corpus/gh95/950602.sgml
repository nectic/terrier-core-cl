MICHAEL Whitaker cast doubt on Britain's Nations Cup plans yesterday
after a first-day disaster at Hickstead.
Whitaker, a key member of the squad preparing for Sunday's six-nation
contest, may pull out following Elton's disappointing display in the
opening event, the Enza International Stakes. He collected 13 faults,
including two refusals, plus four-and-a-half time faults.
with the nine-year-old he planned to ride in both today's grand prix
and the team contest on Sunday.
Whitaker, whose partner was making his first appearance at Hickstead,
said: ''He started well but got into a bit of a panic after hitting a
fence and just didn't seem right. I'd hoped to ride him in the big event
here, but I'm not at all confident now and we'll have to see how he
seems tomorrow.''
Whitaker's elder brother John, Geoff Billington, William Funnell and
Emma Jane Mac are the other members of the squad and could now form the
team looking for a third win in four years.
They had mixed results yesterday as 27-year-old Mexican Luis Ximenez
marked his first appearance in Britain by winning the #2000 first prize
on Airborne Montecillo.
Funnell, on Comex, and Billington, on It's Otto, were the pick of the
British squad. Both had steady rounds with one fence down each, but John
Whitaker hit two with Welham, and Mac three with her lively Diamond.
Enza International Stakes: 1, Airborne Montecillo (L Ximenez, Mexico),
clear, 73.45sec; 2, Zanzibar (C Kappler, USA), clear, 76.01; 3, Heather
Blaze (R Splaine, Ireland), clear, 81.39; 4, Blue Bird (J Popely, GB),
clear, 87.01.
Enza International Speed Stakes: 1, Omnibus (M Ward, USA) 66.54; 2,
Orient De Frebourg (P Delaveau, France), 66.72; 3, Poundstretcher (K
Shore, GB), 66.80.

CLARINETTIST Kenny Davern was not a happy man on Wednesday evening at
Inverness's Eden Court. Ever the perfectionist (often the prima donna),
Davern linked most of the numbers of the pre-interval set with his
customary complaints about the acoustics of the room: he was playing in
the restaurant and not -- as he had expected -- the theatre.
His first move was to switch off his microphone; then he hopped
offstage to sample the sound from ground level. At the height of his
frustration he began berating promoters, sponsors, and the punters there
gathered . . .
They must love their jazz in Inverness because the audience -- despite
being described as ''austere'', and hearing their venue compared to the
House of Pain from The Island of Dr Moreau -- came back for what was
potentially a second assault. Maybe they knew that Davern's fits of
griping are inevitable and that he, none the less, always delivers the
goods. By the second-half, he had clearly decided to accept his lot and
make the best of it, because this set was simply studded with gems.
Accompanied, initially, by only guitarist Dave Cliff, Davern served up
a deliciously slow, soft and quietly breathy What's New, which gained
momentum as bass player Ronnie Rae and drummer Tony MacLennan joined in,
and as Davern's subdued tone gave way to a more dramatic, impassioned
sound.
Another one to savour (and the true highlight of the concert) was
Yellow Dog Blues which the band really got their teeth into; Davern
letting rip with a gutsy, plaintive wail that was enough to send shivers
up at least one spine. Catch him at the Edinburgh Jazz Festival in
August.
* Concert sponsored by British Airways.

FRENCH President Jacques Chirac insisted yesterday that he would no
longer allow his troops in Bosnia to be humiliated.
He said at the funeral of two UN peacekeepers killed in Bosnia:
''France will no longer tolerate its soldiers being humiliated, wounded,
or killed with impunity by those who have chosen to oppose their mission
of peace and protecting civilians.''
He added: ''We will not accept the return of ethnic hatred and
barbarism to the continent.''
These were his first public comments on the crisis in Bosnia since
about some 350 UN peacekeepers -- more than half of them French -- were
taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs, in some cases for use as human shields
against Nato air strikes.
The soldiers buried yesterday in the Britanny garrison town of Vannes
were killed in fighting in Sarajevo last Saturday. The Bosnian Serbs
blocked plans to fly their bodies back to France, forcing them to be
evacuated overland.
As French reinforcements headed towards Bosnia, Mr Chirac vowed that
he would not allow new attacks against peacekeepers to go unpunished.
The President has ordered French troops to resist humiliation and sent
a naval task force to the coast of the former Yugoslavia with 500 elite
troops aboard.
''Europe's security is being played out today in that region,'' he
warned.
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette pledged swift action to reinforce
the beleaguered UN mission and free hostages.
Faced with the deteriorating situation, President Bill Clinton said
yesterday that he had decided to agree to any request for American
ground troops to help the UN peacekeepers regroup.
''I believe we should be prepared to assist Nato if it decides to meet
a request from the United Nations troops for help in a withdrawal or a
reconfiguration and a strengthening of its forces,'' Mr Clinton said at
the US Air Force Academy.
The decision represents a significant shift: he had promised in the
past only to provide US troops to evacuate the peacekeepers.
''We have obligations to our Nato allies, and I do not believe we can
leave them in the lurch,'' he said.
''So I must carefully review any request for an operation involving
the temporary use of our ground forces.''
Meanwhile, Russia welcomed a United Nations report which proposed
replacing the UN troops in Bosnia with a multi-national task force or
scaling it back to a traditional peacekeeping role.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said Moscow needed more
time to study UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's 40-page
report, but said it seemed ''highly realistic'' and offered concrete
proposals.
He made clear Russia supported Mr Boutros-Ghali's comments that the
use of force, such as air strikes, was incompatible with peacekeeping.
But UN diplomats said their governments opposed removing the UN
umbrella from any military action in Bosnia, and Security Council
discussions would reject Mr Boutros-Ghali's move to decouple force from
peacekeeping.
Heavy fighting broke out in the Bosnian enclave of Gorazde again
yesterday, but the UN, with hundreds of hostages held by the Bosnian
Serbs, was unable to respond.
Fierce fighting raged in the so-called UN ''safe area'' throughout
Wednesday as Muslim-led Bosnian Government troops and rebel Serbs
battled for control of defence lines abandoned by UN blue helmets.
With further air strikes on hold, the UN has few means left to protect
the enclave from any determined Serb attack like the one last year which
stopped only after UN commanders ordered Nato bombing raids.
Meanwhile, the UN in Sarajevo yesterday refused to bow to Serb
conditions for the release of the nearly 400 hostages.
Spokesman Alexander Ivanko said: ''It is the opinion of this command
that currently we should not negotiate on the issue of the hostages and
that we should demand their unconditional release.''

A BOSNIAN aid agency boss last night hit out at the Government's
decision to send more peace-keeping troops.
Ms Nikkie du Preez of Edinburgh-based Bosnia Now, which funds doctors
in the field and helps refugees, said Mr Major was putting British
soldiers at risk needlessly.
As she made her comments, workers from another Bosnian charity,
Edinburgh Direct Aid, were gearing up to go back to deliver much-needed
supplies later this month. Founder Denis Rutovitz said the troops had a
vital humanitarian role to play in Bosnia and carried out important
work.
Ms du Preez, however, said she thought the war in Bosnia was too
complex, with factions changing sides regularly, for the United Nations
to have any influence.
She said: ''The situation there has gone beyond international remedy.
It is an utter waste to send out British soldiers. The Bosnians are
going through a tragedy which will reach a conclusion within the next 10
years and there is nothing anyone or any foreign power can do to stop
it.
''By sending troops to Bosnia we are just prolonging the agony of the
people there.''
However, Mr Radovitz said: ''It is a very good thing the soldiers are
there. We have been out to Bosnia and seen the splendid job they do
there on humanitarian matters.
''The troops go beyond the remit of their work there and spend their
own free time mending trenches and fixing devastated schools.''

BRITISH commanders in Bosnia were yesterday assembling an armoured
infantry battle group to protect United Nations peacekeepers amid
confusion over command and disagreements with the French.
The speed of the British response to the seizing of hostages by the
Bosnian Serbs has surprised the French authorities, traditionally proud
that they are the largest contributor of forces to the region.
The Government's sudden decision to send 6500 reinforcements as rapid
reaction reserves to bolster the peacekeeping effort has removed that
distinction.
Although the French are keen to contribute extra forces, there are
sharp disputes over the command structure and how the reserve forces
will operate.
A senior UK official admitted: ''Other nations might feel the
initiative has been taken by the UK.''
It is hoped agreements can be thrashed out at a meeting of defence
ministers and military chiefs in Paris tomorrow, although Britain has
yet to confirm it is attending.
As Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind warned the Serbs that Britain did
not make threats it could not carry out, the Prime Minister again warned
of massive bloodshed if Britain were to withdraw. ''If we took those
troops out and that humanitarian work ended, hundreds who are alive
today would die in the future,'' he said.
''I think we have an obligation to prevent that tragedy and we will
play our part in doing so.''
The armoured reserve force of up to 2000 men now being formed at the
British base at Vitez, in central Bosnia, will be commanded by Brigadier
Andrew Pringle.
It will be centred on the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, equipped
with up to 55 Warrior armoured fighting vehicles, 82mm mortars, and
Milan anti-tank missile systems.
The force will also have 32 Scimitar light tanks, six Lynx anti-tank
helicopters and two batteries of 105mm guns, which are on their way to
the region this week.
British officials said new rules of engagement would have to be drawn
up because artillery has never formed part of a UN peacekeeping mission.
Other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, and Holland, have
indicated their willingness to contribute forces to the reserve and
Britain would welcome French participation, officials said.
However, the deployment of the 5500-strong 24 Airmobile Brigade, which
is expected later this month, will create a second much larger rapid
reaction protection force -- and extra problems.
A new level of headquarters at two-star, major-general equivalent,
will need to be set up to co-ordinate the reserve forces. The command is
inevitably another area of contention between Britain and France.
Mr Rifkind, on the BBC Radio 4 World at One programme, welcomed the
announcement of President Bill Clinton that US ground forces could be
sent temporarily to Bosnia to help redeploy UN forces, rather than just
a withdrawal.
Asked if Britain would consider military action to rescue its
hostages, Mr Rifkind said: ''I'm not going to speculate at all.''
Nevertheless, he warned the Serbs to take Britain seriously over the
hostages: ''We have always been very careful not to make any threats we
aren't able and willing to carry out, and not to set any policy that
isn't capable of implementation.''
A dramatic SAS-style operation to free the hostages has virtually been
ruled out, not least because the whereabouts of some of them are simply
not known.
Downing Street declined to go beyond anything that Mr Major said in
his Commons speech on Wednesday: that no undertakings would be given to
the Bosian Serbs to abandon air strikes, the prime cause of the
hostage-taking.
However, the Prime Minister did make it clear that the British
Government would not accede to blackmail to secure the release of the 33
Royal Welch Fusiliers and the one RAF officer held captive.
Mr Major has also underlined that should any harm befall any of the
British hostages, then the Bosnian Serb leaders, notably Radovan
Karadzic, would be held personally responsible.
The Serbs hold a total of 370 UN personnel, including the 34 Britons.
Diplomatic sources indicated there is unlikely to be any quick
response to the demands by the West in general and Britain in particular
for the release of the men.
There is a feeling that if there is a lull in bombing strikes --
without any undertakings being given -- then the hostages may gradually
trickle back.
Observers believe that Britain and the UN can do little more at the
moment than play a possibly long-drawn-out waiting game.

THE Queen sent a message of hope last night to British soldiers held
hostage in Bosnia, after listening to the fears of their wives.
In a message to the Royal Welch Fusiliers -- 33 of whom are being held
captive by Bosnian Serbs -- she spoke of her pride after meeting
regimental families during a visit to Wales yesterday.
Her words followed an emotional service in which she and the Duke of
Edinburgh joined in prayers for the hostages, of whose regiment she is
colonel-in-chief.
A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ''I visited the regiment's
families today in Haverfordwest. Despite the grave situation you are
facing, I find them in good heart, supporting each other in the finest
tradition of the regiment. You can be proud of them as I am proud of
you. I send my warm good wishes to you all.''
In a private 15-minute meeting at the Royal Welch Fusiliers' married
quarters, the Queen sat down with five young women whose husbands were
captured by the Bosnian Serbs.
Buckingham Palace and the Army arranged the special gathering in a
private room from which the media was excluded. Surrounded by the
mothers and six young children, aged between five weeks and six years,
the Queen listened intently to their concerns. Palace aides said the
Queen spoke to the whole group but also spent time talking individually
during the informal session.
The session took place well away from members of the press covering
the Queen's visit to a community centre on the edge of a sprawling
housing estate which is home to many of the 600 Royal Welch serving in
Bosnia.
After her private talks, the Queen, smiling and relaxed, met other
Army wives who had been collecting clothing for homeless Bosnian
civilian refugees caught up in the fighting.
Among them was Yvonne Thomas, 22, of Holyhead, north Wales, whose
husband Darren, 21, recently returned to the war zone after home leave.
''I have mixed feelings about the situation,'' said Mrs Thomas. ''Darren
won't tell me much because he doesn't want me to worry. But I know he is
OK. We have got to get on with our lives and be patient -- but it's
difficult to sit back here and just be waiting all the time.''

ANNAN-based auctioneers Thomson, Roddick, and Laurie have issued a
statement clarifying their latest interest in Castle Douglas firm
Wallets Marts.
They have instructed their solicitors to approach Wallets with an
offer of #725,000 for the Castle Douglas auction market and adjoining
paddocks. They do not, however, propose to make an offer to acquire the
shares of Wallets Marts.
If successful, TR&amp;L would base their livestock administration in
Castle Douglas and incorporate Wallets into the trading name.
Meanwhile, the Wallets board have repeated their advice to
shareholders to reject the latest offer from James Craig of Ayr. They
issued their statement as Craig's were putting their case to about 100
Wallets shareholders at a specially convened meeting in Castle Douglas.
Craig's directors said that if their bid was successful they would run
markets at Ayr, Castle Douglas and Newton Stewart. After the meeting
Craig's claimed that they had detected a good deal of support for their
offer which values the company at #1.5m.
Wallets rejection document raises the possibility of creating a new
company which would hold all their non-operational assets and would
still be owned by the Wallets shareholders.

THE grading system for cattle carcasses in British markets is of more
benefit to the meat trade than it is to the end-consumer, Dr Basil
Lowman, senior beef specialist with the Scottish Agricultural College,
claimed yesterday.
The better the conformation of an animal the more of it could be sold
as meat, he agreed. However, there was little relationship between the
shape of the animal and what it would taste like. ''The fascination the
commercial beef industry has with carcass conformation is difficult to
understand,'' he said.
Dr Lowman was speaking at a preview for the forthcoming international
gathering to be held by the Highland Cattle Society which has plans to
raise the breed's profile as a source of quality meat.
An undoubted problem for the Highland cattle carcasses in the
commercial market was their shape, said Dr Lowman. But in his view the
shape was generally unimportant. ''It doesn't matter whether I buy my
Smarties in a tube or a box, the important thing is that they are
Smarties and not asprin.
''The Highland breed is not the best beef breed in the world in terms
of conformation but it does have a reputation for high-eating quality.''
He suggested that breeders should not allow their product to be
marketed through intermediaries, where it would lose its identity. He
advised that they seek to deal directly with the kind of consumer who
was interested mainly in high-eating quality.
The Highland breed, he believed, could command a niche market
position, taking a leaf out of the book of Ayrshire Milk producers who
were seeking to promote their milk as a branded premium product.
The main objective of the agriculture industry 15 years ago had been
to increase food production, with eating quality coming in as a
secondary consideration, said Dr Loman. Now high-eating quality coupled
with ''green'' and welfare issues were much more important to consumers.
The Highland breed could score highly on these points.
However Dr Lowman advised potential Highland beef producers to
consider moving away from the traditional idea of a steer being brought
to the market between three and four years of age. By that time the
animal would have cost up to #100 on interest charges alone for feed, he
said.
''There is no good reason why Highland breeders should not produce
good quality finished steers at any age from two years,'' he said.
Putting in extra feeding at strategic times could benefit both the
financial viability of the exercise and the animals themselves.
He pointed to the experience of the Strathmore Farming Company at
Glamis where manager David Soutar had put Highland-cross bulls through
an intensive barley beef system and found they kept pace with the
Charollais. It appeared that the perceived slow growth rate of the
Highland was more a reflection of their management than the cattle
themselves.

LANDOWNERS, owner-occupiers, and even some tenants could face
substantial costs unless the Environment Bill, currently passing through
its committee stages in the House of Commons is amended, according to
the Scottish Landowners Federation.
The Bill, which was initiated in the House of Lords, broadly sticks to
the principle of the polluter pays. It has two sections which affect
Scotland.
The first creates the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)
to replace the various River Purification Boards, HM Industrial
Pollution Inspectorate, and most of the environmental regulation
functions of local authorities and the Secretary of State.
Basically a system of integrated pollution control will be introduced
allowing SEPA to consider environmental implications on a wider front.
One aspect of this section of the Bill covers land drainage where
large-scale schemes will require prior notice to SEPA, but the
landowners federation has received an assurance that normal agricultural
drainage will be excluded from the condition although it is still not
clear what constitutes a large scheme.
However, it is part two of the bill covering contaminated land where
the possibility of real conflict arises with the rules as they stand
suggesting that any liability will fall on the current landowner or
possibly tenant rather than on the party which was originally
responsible.
The implications for farmers thinking of purchasing their units from
British Coal are considerable especially in Fife and Central region
where there is a long history of underground workings dating back into
the last century. British Coal has, however, softened its original
stance which tried to pass responsibility for pollution to purchasers.
So far, the Government has accepted an amendment which excludes
surface owners for liability for mine water pollution, but attempts to
have similar exclusions included for other types of underground
contamination which do not belong to the surface owner have been
unsuccessful.
Attempts by the landowners federation to exclude liability on the part
of owners and occupiers who could not reasonably have known of problems
with the land when they acquired it have also been rejected.
Another worry is Clause 54 of the Bill which states that where
contaminated land which requires attention the ''person who caused or
knowingly permitted'' the particular substance to be on the land will be
responsible.'' If that person cannot be found, or liability has been
transferred as in a sale or lease, the owner or occupier of the land
will then be responsible.
This, in effect, means that should an individual purchase a farm and
then discover perhaps three years later that there is a pollution
problem not of his making he will be liable to the cost of remedying the
situation.
The scale of potential fines for not complying with SEPA notices to
clean up the land is, according to the federation, frightening.
They could range from as much of #2000 per day or a straight penalty
of #20,000.

NEW Look, the nationwide chain of women's clothing stores,
consolidates its advance into Scotland today by opening its largest ever
shop in Glasgow's Argyle Street.
The privately owned company, based in Weymouth, sells its own label
clothing through 261 stores in the UK and 13 in France.
It crossed the Border in March by opening a branch in Kilmarnock and
aims to have 14 shops in Scotland by the end of July.
Glasgow is number nine, but the company has still not yet chosen a
site in Edinburgh, complaining that prime sites in the city are
difficult to come by.
Catering for the lower end of the market, New Look sells clothes aimed
at a wide range of age groups for prices that vary between #3 and #35.
The chain aims to have 300 shops by the end of this year and achieve a
turnover of #200m, but it still only accounts for 1.5% of the UK market
for women's outer garments.
This compares to a 16% to 17% share for Marks &amp; Spencer, which New
Look faces across the road in Argyle Street.
Like all New Look shops, the 4000sq ft Glasgow branch is painted
bright white inside with plenty of shiny chrome and reflecting glass.
This gives it the appearance of a hastily transformed hospital
operating theatre, but New Look director Gavin Aldred says the clean,
bare decor is intended to highlight the apparel on display.
''This is larger than our shop in Oxford Street in London so we have
high hopes for Glasgow,'' he said.
New Look plans to invest more than #2m in Scotland this year and
create 260 new jobs, but Mr Aldred acknowledged that 80% of these would
be part-time.
The company was founded by the Singh family in 1969 and made a pre-tax
profit of #10.5m in the year to March 1994 on turnover #121m.
Margins were ''well over 10%,'' he said.

NORTH Sea oil revenues in April reached their highest level since the
end of the Gulf war, it was revealed yesterday.
With oil output virtually unchanged at 2.67 million barrels per day,
buoyant prices resulted in a 10% month-on-month increase in daily oil
revenues to #30.9m, according to the latest Royal Bank of Scotland Oil
and Gas Index.
Combined oil and gas output fell 6%, to the equivalent of 4.04 million
barrels of oil per day, but this third consecutive monthly decline was
the result of the seasonal drop in gas production. The index of oil and
gas production, at 179.8, remains some 9% higher than a year ago.
In spite of the fall in gas output, total daily revenues from the
North Sea fell less than 1% to #45m.
Royal Bank of Scotland energy economist Mark Shea was surprised by the
underlying strength of the latest figures, taken in the context of
growth of about 25% in North Sea output last year.
He said: ''Last year we saw strong growth and we are expecting it to
plateau next year. Despite the fact that it is starting to level out,
the figures for April were still surprisingly strong.''
Oil prices were boosted by international factors. The Iraqi rejection
of the United Nations' latest offer, which would have allowed them to
make limited exports, signalled that they would be out of the market for
some time.
Strikes by Brazil's oil workers, which reduced the country's refinery
throughput to a fraction of its normal level, also helped push Brent
crude prices above $19 per barrel in the last week of April.
Prices have also been supported by US economic sanctions against Iran
and bullish data on US gasoline demand.
During the month, average oil prices rose 10% to $18.62 per barrel
but, amid indications of an end to the Brazilian strike and with the
market having settled down after initial over-reactions to international
events, prices are now back below $18.
However, they have not fallen back to the $16.50 level seen in January
and Mr Shea believes this is good news for oil producers, as it suggests
the market is now fundamentally stronger.
Oil companies will be able to plough profits from higher prices into
exploration of fields West of Shetland.
Average daily gas production fell 17% to 7792 million cubic feet per
day, with demand weaker as a result of the warmer weather.

BANK of Scotland yesterday moved to strengthen its capital base
through an #111m issue of Preference stock, to accommodate continuing
growth in lending.
Reinforcing Governor Sir Bruce Pattullo's comments when the bank
announced record pre-tax profits of #450m in April, general manager and
secretary Hugh Young said the group was not currently looking at the
purchase of a building society.
Mr Young stressed that the additional capital was not being raised
with a view to acquisitions. He said: ''If we were ever seriously
looking at a building society, we would probably have to come back and
raise further capital.''
The issue, at 113.191p, of 100 million 9[1/4]%, non-cumulative,
irredeemable Preference shares with a par value of #1, will raise about
#111m net of expenses.
Announcing the expansion of its capital base, Bank of Scotland said
the current financial year had started well.
Some growth in business is being experienced and, with lending
continuing to advance modestly, the board is confident about prospects.
Bank of Scotland has already made an exceptional profit of #23.6m on
the sale to Halifax Building Society, in March, of its share of the
Halifax Credit Card joint venture.
Although Bank of Scotland's ''Tier 1'' core capital ratio increased
from 5.8% to 6.1% in the year to end-February, it was the second lowest
among the major UK clearing banks.
While it is well ahead of the international requirement of 4%, and the
5% level at which the Bank of England would require remedial action,
there is a trend towards higher capital ratios on both sides of the
Atlantic.
Ordinary and Preference stock, together with retained profits, make up
the top line of the ratio, which should rise to about 6.5% as a result
of the issue.
The bottom-line involves a complex calculation of weighted
liabilities. The amount of lending business which a bank may write
depends on the size of its capital base.
Mr Young said: ''We feel we should be strengthening our Tier 1 ratio.
We did grow our lending in the last financial year, albeit modestly,
when the English banks went backwards. Our lending continues to grow
modestly.''
The issue of the Preference stock requires the approval of
shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on June 20. Dealings
are expected to commence on June 21.

FERGUSON Shipbuilders' chief executive Bill Scott yesterday appealed
for a rapid end to uncertainty over the ownership of his Port Glasgow
yard so that it can win new orders to secure its long-term future.
''Unless we receive new orders within the next six months we will be
sitting with a very thin order book in April next year and no work
beyond June,'' Mr Scott said.
''Uncertainty over the ownership of this company will be a major
obstacle in securing new work,'' he added.
Ferguson, which employs 350 people building small specialist ships
such as tugs and car ferries, has been the target of three takeover bids
since February.
Two of these have fallen by the wayside and the board is privately
divided over whether to accept the third.
Documents sent to shareholders show that Mr Scott and a majority of
other Ferguson directors support the outstanding #4.9m bid by
Glasgow-based electrical wholesaler Holland House.
But two others oppose it, including the chairman Sir Ross Belch, who
launched and then withdrew his own bid for Ferguson earlier this year.
Holland House, which is owned by 80-year-old millionaire Frank Dunnet,
has given Ferguson's 290 shareholders until June 20 to accept a cash
offer of 406p per share.
The Ferguson directors papered over their division by declaring that
they would neither endorse nor reject the bid, but much bitterness has
been created in the boardroom since Sir Ross set the takeover ball
rolling with his own failed bid for Ferguson in February.
Sir Ross made a cash plus shares bid through Altnacraig Shipping
another company that he controls.
This provoked a counter-bid by a management buyout team led by Mr
Scott.
But both withdrew when Holland House came on the scene with a cash
only offer that valued Ferguson at #1m more than its net assets.
The reason officially put forward for the board's neutrality is that
the Holland House offer, although considered ''fair and reasonable,''
could result in a loss of tax benefits for shareholders who bought into
Ferguson under a Business Expansion Scheme in March 1991.
Mr Scott and his finance director Richard Deane, have indicated their
personal willingness to accept the Holland House offer.
So to have non-executive directors Sir Ian Denholm and Richard
Parkinson.
But Sir Ross and another non-executive director, Gordon Parham, have
said they do not intend to sell.
More than 90% of the investors who bought shares with tax benefits
under the Business Expansion Scheme invested less than #5000.
Although they would lose their tax breaks by selling their shares less
than five years after they bought them, most directors believe this
would not substantially dent the net value of a generous Holland House
offer.
But Sir Ross and Mr Parham argue that many shareholders appear
reluctant to sell and that Ferguson can still prosper under its present
ownership.
Whatever the truth of the matter, if the Holland House bid fails, the
profitable little shipyard could become the target of yet another
predator.
Ferguson made a #1.5m pre-tax profit last year on turnover of #19m and
has cash balances of several million pounds. After three bids in as many
months the company effectively has a ''for sale'' sign hoisted over it.

PHILIP Walton, recently berated for his non-committal attitude towards
the Ryder Cup match, yesterday advanced his own chances of making this
year's European team. Currently eighteenth on the points table, the
genial Irishman shot 65, seven under par, to share the lead after the
first round of the Murphy's English Open at Forest of Arden.
Walton was joined by Alexander Cejka, also a winner this season, when
the German came home in 30, six under. They were a stroke ahead of
Australia's Peter Senior who, like Walton, employs a long-handled
putter. In the group a stroke further behind was the young New
Zealander, Michael Campbell, who outscored his distinguished partners
Colin Montgomerie, the holder, and Sam Torrance.
Walton thinks there is too much pressure on players both to qualify
for the team to meet the United States and during the contest itself.
''It's everyone's dream to play,'' Walton admitted, ''but the fun has
gone out of the match. The mere thought of letting down the whole of the
side coming to the eighteenth is destroying some players.''
Walton, who just missed playing on the 1989 side, continued: ''In the
Ryder Cup you see guys coming off the last green with their eyes in the
back of their heads.'' Then he added, illogically given golf's frequent
verity: ''I just think it's unfair that it comes down to one small putt
on the final green.''
Anyway, Walton unfurled a splendidly stable game. He did not drop a
stroke in the variable weather and was particularly satisfied with the
last two of his seven birdies, a No.5-iron shot cut 40 yards round a
tree to 12 feet at the fourteenth and a No.8-iron chip-in at the short
last, stubbed out of a rough lie 30 feet from the hole.
Walton, at 33, gained his second career victory in Catalonia, Cejka,
aged 24, his first in Andalucia five weeks earlier. That achievement
changed the Czech-born naturalised German into a more positive thinker,
no longer content just to make cuts. That new confidence was reflected
in his inward half, the result of accurate iron play through the numbers
and consistent holing-out.
Senior, at 36, is playing with such consistency that he has made his
ambition this season to win on every tour he plays. So far he is on
target having had victories in Japan and Australia, and his equal fourth
finish at the weekend, after he had held the first-round lead, was an
intimation of his European challenge.
On Monday, Campbell concluded the PGA championship eagle, birdie,
birdie, birdie; now, having played the first six holes in three over
par, he covered the next 11 in nine under. That magic wand of a putter,
which had to function only 22 times at Wentworth, operated for 27
strokes. Campbell had nine singles, seven on the inward half in which he
had only 11 putts.
Campbell acknowledged Montgomerie, with whom he was playing for the
first time, to have been very supportive. ''After the eagle,'' the New
Zealander said, ''he remarked that Kiwis couldn't only play rugby, they
could play golf too'' -- a generous remark considering Montgomerie was
then in the middle of yet another anti-climax.
The holder's thinning patience was again sorely tested. He was five
under with five to play but he dropped two strokes, the last a 6 at the
long seventeenth. ''If you can't make par from the middle of a fairway
you need your head examining -- and that's what I need,'' was
Montgomerie's scathing self-recrimination.
Andrew Coltart joined Montgomerie on 69 a much relieved player after
having narrowly gained exemption into the Open Championship despite
missing the cut at Wentworth, where the hard greens demoralised him.
More comfortable on these receptive and smooth surfaces, Coltart had
five birdies, the only blip a double bogey 6 at the sixth where he took
two in a fairway bunker.
The most favoured Scottish perch was 70 on which roosted Torrance,
Sandy Lyle, Dean Robertson, and Ross Drummond, all of 10 strokes ahead
of Mike Miller who was out on 36 but took 44 to return as he wrestled
vainly to adhere to the swing advice given him only last week by David
Leadbetter. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
65 -- P Walton, A Cejka (Germany).
66 -- P Senior (Australia).
67 -- M Campbell (New Zealand), M A Martin (Spain), M Davis, J Spence.
68 -- A Forsbrand (Sweden), W Riley (Australia), P Price, T Price

Rocca (Italy), A Coltart, K Eriksson (Sweden), A Oldcorn, P Baker, J M
Canizares (Spain).
70 -- I Pyman, S Torrance, J Rivero (Spain), R Drummond, D Robertson,
S Ames (Trinidad), R Wessels (S Africa), J Van de Velde (France), J
Quiros (Spain), S Lyle, D Cooper, R Davis (Australia), D Feherty, M Roe,
P Broadhurst, E Darcy, E O'Connell, P Hedblom (Sweden), M Clayton

71 -- M Mouland, G Brand Jr, N Fasth (Sweden), P Linhart (Spain), G
Evans, P Affleck, P Quirici (Switzerland), S Cage, F Tarnaud (France), M
Hallberg (Sweden), J Haeggman (Sweden), R Claydon, J McHenry.
Other scores included: 72 -- A Hunter, G Orr, P Lawrie. 74 -- I
Woosnam. 75 -- S McAllister, C Cassells. 78 -- B Gallacher. 80 -- M
Miller, F Clark.

FRANCE will have to find another gear from somewhere if they are to
exact revenge over Scotland tomorrow for the Five Nations' Championship
defeat in the Parc des Princes earlier this year.
That has been the verdict of most neutral observers who have witnessed
the comparative displays of the Tricolours and Scotland against Tonga
and Ivory Coast, but yesterday that verdict was given added credence
from within the French camp.
Coach Pierre Berbizier, who barked at his players throughout a low-key
training session within the grounds of Pretoria Prison, declared that if
his side plays the same brand of rugby that they did against the Tongans
and the Ivoriennes then they will have ''lots of problems'' against
Scotland.
Much of that could, of course, be just more of the pre-match hype
which has surrounded this meeting of the auld rivals -- manager Guy
Laporte insisting still that the Scots have been indulging in spasmodic
bouts of nocturnal restaurant-wrecking -- but there is no doubt that the
psychological advantage lies with the Scots.
Incidentally, in view of the fact that the French are billeted in
splendid and bucolic isolation within a complex of thatched chalets some
10km from Pretoria, it is small wonder that Laporte's mind should stray
to the attractions and distractions of night-time city life.
When last Scotland played France, on February 18, the Scots secured
the first victory on French soil for 26 years. The incentive for both
sides to come out on top at the Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria on
Saturday could not be keener. Both have now qualified for the
quarter-finals, but the second-placed team will play the All Blacks with
the pool winners meeting Ireland or Wales. No disrespect to the Irish or
Welsh, but there are no prizes for guessing which side the French and
Scots would both like to meet.
Berbizier reckoned that Gavin Hastings' men would still be on a high
with the memory of that momentous Paris win still fresh in their minds.
France, he said, had still to achieve that frame of mind, but he
reminded the Scottish camp that last year France had won at Murrayfield
for the first time since 1978.
Yesterday at training, with the French threequarters sporting their
shorn heads -- fitting in the prison-setting circumstances --
Berbizier's men spent quite a bit of time fielding high balls. He said
later that he fully expected Scotland to play that type of game with
Craig Chalmers and Gavin Hastings shoeing the leather off the ball.
Hastings has all season long commended the Scots for the level of
fitness that they have achieved and he has nominated the fitness factor
as one of the ingredients for success over France last time out.
Berbizier discounted any suggestion thay the Scots were in better
physical shape than the French.
''No doubt that is what he hopes but I can assure him that the French
side is in good shape and on Saturday we will give him the answer that
he deserves,'' he said. ''He has been an inspiration for his side this
season, but we will want to make sure that we do not give him the
opportunity to add to his World Cup points records.''
Yesterday the French camp were echoing the noises being made within
Scottish ranks that, in reality and for both sides, the World Cup begins
in earnest tomorrow.
''We have not played that well and we have just done enough to win.
But for Saturday we have picked our first-choice side and there are
different vibes about the game against Scotland. We will be adopting a
different approach than with the other games,'' said the former French
scrum half who, according to reports from back home, desperately needs a
good World Cup showing if he is to hang on to his job.
Yesterday the diminutive Frenchman was accorded Scottish hospitality
in the shape of a Hawick Ball from The Herald's Bill McLaren.
Berbizier's only concern was that the peppermint delicacy might have a
detrimental drug-test effect.

A CLASSIC confrontation between Celtic Swing and Pennekamp for the
Derby was ruled out yesterday when connections of the one-time ''wonder
horse'' took the softer option by committing themselves to France.
The colt, runner-up to Pennekamp in the 2000 Guineas, will contest the
Prix du Jockey-Club at Chantilly on Sunday. Owner Peter Savill ended
weeks of speculation by ruling in favour of the less demanding Chantilly
circuit, where softer ground than Epsom is anticipated.
Celtic Swing is evens favourite for the Prix du Jockey-Club, while
Pennekamp has hardened to 6-4 for the Derby.

JIM Glass, the man who wants to take on the job of running Hearts, is
prepared for a first refusal from the current board once his offer is
analysed, but, if he expects to lose the battle, he is confident of
winning the war.
Retired property developer Glass, who has been a season-ticket-holder
at Tynecastle for many years, said yesterday he anticipates that Hearts
chairman Chris Robinson will turn down his initial #2m offer, because it
is based on doubling the present shareholding at his offer 80p per share
compared with the #1.60 that was paid by Robinson and his vice-chairman,
Leslie Deans, when they bought control from Wallace Mercer a year ago.
However, as the prospective chairman puts it, there are differences
between the bids. ''First of all, I said at the time Wallace sold out
that it was over-priced. I thought then that 80p was about right.
Secondly, the money went to Wallace, whereas the cash this time will go
straight to the manager to buy players.''
The game plan carefully thought out by Glass would then include a
public shares issue, which he is confident would raise a further #2m and
put the club on a reasonably sound financial base from which he would
implement his five-year strategy.
The first part of that plan would be resurrecting the Hearts Property
Development Company, which was originally founded when Mercer and Glass
hoped to build a new stadium at Millershall. Had that idea gone through,
Glass would have been on the board long before now, but it failed and
the club went on a different course. If he is successful, Glass wants to
bring that company into being again, but refuses to reveal details.
Glass sees his Hearts task as comparable with one of his jobs, a kind
of company trouble-shooter. He said: ''If I am able to take control, I
will tackle it as a challenge like the ones I have taken on in other
circumstances. I had to bring companies into profitability and I believe
that could be done with Hearts.''

<TEXT>
IN the aftermath of the confrontation between Celtic manager Tommy
Burns and managing director Fergus McCann it seems likely that the
Parkhead club will work out a new contract deal for Burns.
My understanding is that the manager will be given a contract which
will make clear what his duties are in an effort to avoid the friction
which has arisen between himself and McCann.
It will specify the areas in which Burns can operate without undue
interference from elsewhere, and, to underline the trust they have in
the 38-year-old manager, there may even be an extension to the deal he
agreed when he was appointed to the job last summer.
Then Burns signed a four-year contract, and now, after having won the
Scottish Cup, that could well have another year added to it as the
Parkhead board attempt to impress upon Burns and everyone else the faith
they have in him and his abilities.
The contract, added to the new set-up at the club, will ease the
worries which caused Burns to speak out in the first place.
From now on the manager and McCann will have a buffer zone between
them with directors Dominic Keane and Willie Haughey acting as liaison
men between the financial department and the footballing side of Celtic.
That move makes sense, just as it makes sense to give Burns the trust
he felt he was missing.
As that is being worked out, Celtic must also move quickly into the
transfer market.
Negotiations for foreign players such as Marc Degryse and Dimitry
Radchenko need time, but the problem for Celtic is that the fans who so
recently became shareholders are running out of patience. They want
action.
Something has to happen soon to appease the support, and McCann has
the ball in his court as far as that is concerned.

ALISTER McRae hopes to extend his lead in the Mobil 1/Top Gear British
Rally Championship with a home win this weekend in the Perth Scottish
Rally.
The Lanark driver holds a 12-point advantage after the opening two
rounds going into the three-day event, won previously by his father,
Jimmy, and brother, Colin, which starts today in Perth.
''Obviously, I'd like to try and emulate Dad and Colin by winning the
event, but the competition is stiff,'' said McRae.
His main competition will come from current Formula Two champion David
Llewellin (Vauxhall Astra), Gwyndaf Evans (Escort RS2000) and Nissan
team-mate Gregoire de Mevius.
The Belgian is still on a high after his Formula Two victory in the
Kielder Forest, while McRae will remember the transmission problems that
dogged his Scottish challenge last year.
Llewellin will be looking for his fourth Scottish Rally success,
having triumphed in 1987, 1988 and 1990.
The rally, with 124 crews taking part, starts from the North Inch in
Perth and includes 19 special stages over 155 miles before finishing in
Perth on Sunday.
* SIMTEK yesterday confirmed they are pulling out of the Canadian
Grand Prix on June 11. The Banbury-based team, whose debut season in
Formula One last year was marred by the death of Roland Ratzenberger,
have been forced to withdraw after failing to find more backing.
Team owner Nick Wirth revealed before last weekend's Monaco Grand Prix
that he needed further funds to be able to carry on as a competitive
unit.

TOMORROW is Le Crunch day. We're guaranteed a place in the
quarter-finals but we badly want to win against France, first to show
that our victory at Parc des Princes in February was no fluke, and
secondly because we would be daft to prefer a quarter-final slot against
the All Blacks as opposed to Ireland or Wales.
We don't fear the All Blacks -- after their showing against Wales on
Wednesday night, they are most definitely beatable, and I say that in
spite of what happened at Murrayfield in November, 1993.
In any case, I don't think it does any good to look beyond tomorrow's
game. There's a real positive outlook among the side and the feeling is
that we will beat France and then play whoever we have to in the next
round. The ideal way to proceed to the quarter-finals is to win every
game as it comes along.
Those tales coming out of the French camp about the Scots boys
wrecking restaurants in Pretoria are, frankly, pathetic. The story seems
to have come from the French manager, Guy Laporte. He's at it. The
stories are complete and utter garbage.
If Laporte thinks that he is playing a clever game of trying to psych
us out, then he's got another think coming. All that he has managed to
do is to give us another reason for wanting to beat the Frenchmen.
However, we know that tomorrow at Loftus Versfeld we face our first
real test of the tournament. No disrespect to Ivory Coast or Tonga, but
they weren't really on the same level as Scotland.
The Tongans gave us a really hard, physical game on Tuesday night but
we knew that if we were patient, then the scores and the right result
would come. Like all South Sea islanders they really like to put in the
big hits -- and some of them were so late, they were almost posthumous
-- but we dished out a few of our own as well, and quite a few of the
Tongans were looking decidely second-hand by the end.
Personally, I didn't have that great a game against them. The ball
didn't run for me and I was disappointed with what I managed to achieve
with the possession that I did get. I'm hoping for better things against
the French tomorrow.
Gavin had another field-day and the records just keep on tumbling. At
the start of the season his critics said he was an old crock with a bad
back. If that's what a bad back does for you, then we should all have
them on prescription.
We were relaxing by the hotel pool on Wednesday and a few of the boys
were thrown in. Gavin's play has been so miraculous this season that
none of us would have been surprised if he had just walked off across
the water!
We were joined by the girls on Tuesday night, after the Tonga game.
They have been living up at Sun City and they've been on safari, but
they join up with us here in Pretoria after games.
It's a bit of a novelty to have the wives and girlfriends across on
tour but there's no doubt that, in a tournament like this when we play
three Tests within the space of just over a week, you really do need
quality relaxation time to let you recover from the aches and strains.

MORNE du Plessis, the South African manager and former Springbok, has
a satisfied look at the moment. Perhaps it's because his charges are
blazing their way about the country, and their undefeated run should
continue against the plucky Canadians on Saturday. Or perhaps it also
has something to do with the brand new Sports Science Institute for
South Africa that has sprung up where once stood Western Province's
second pitch and has been, principally, his baby.
He thought of the idea, and he brought together the principal parties,
the most important one being the University of Cape Town.
Du Plessis showed Roy Laidlaw and me around a building that has
facilities that include sports medicine suites, 15 research
laboratories, two indoor running tracks, a pool, and high-tech gymnasia.
All in pursuit of victory in a chosen range of sports, which are rugby,
cricket, soccer, athletics, and swimming. But, to me, the Institute's
cross-over with rugby is interesting.
''We will be taking on apprentice rugby players to teach them about
skills as diverse as marketing, coaching, clubhouse management, and
ground maintenance. There will be in-house learning and study facilities
for these apprentices,'' said du Plessis.
''What will be the selection criteria for these apprentices?'' asked
Laidlaw. Du Plessis paused for a second. ''They will be the best young
players in the region,'' he said. ''We have to realise that the game
will not remain amateur, and we must make sure we keep the best within
the game.''
Effectively, this institute will be hastening the advent of
professionalism in the game by teaching the elite youngsters how to make
the best of their chosen profession.
We walked up another flight of stairs. ''Where did all the money come
from to build this?'' I asked. ''We have many companies in this country
that want us to succeed at sport,'' said du Plessis. ''So, what happened
was that we were given the money by seven different companies.''
I rest my case, your honour. Can anyone seriously imagine companies in
Scotland being so concerned about our sporting and health welfare that
they plough money into a project like the Newlands building? At one time
it may have been nothing but a pipe dream, but now it is a reality that
will push South Africa firmly on to the sporting map.
One criticism of the South Africans on the rugby front is that their
training methods are outdated, and significantly SARFU, the rugby
authority, was the first body to rent space in the building.
''We are taking this all seriously,'' stated du Plessis. You bet they
are. Back in Scotland there is much talk of each of the sports trying to
form their own centres of excellence, but here, in Cape Town, is the
embryo development of a rainbow country as it attempts to do it all
under one roof.
One major lesson that du Plessis learned from his visits to America
and Australia to fact-find was that establishments that deal only in
applied research find it hard to keep their best staff. The Australian
Institute of Sport in Canberra, for instance, has a large turnaround of
staff, and cannot attract the real brains of the medical community,
because there is no facility for pure research. Hence the tie-up with
the University of Cape Town.
There will, no doubt, be other lessons to be learned by those, such as
the Scots, who will come to South Africa to examine their solution. It
is a brave step, and, just to make sure he has been doing his job
thoroughly, Roy Laidlaw has obtained a set of plans for the building.
Bed-time reading for Jim Telfer, for sure.

JANET Jack has been forced to withdraw from the squad for this
weekend's matches against England because of a hamstring injury.
Scotland will now be without six of their European Nations Cup squad
for the matches at Lilleshall as Tracey Robb, Wendy Fraser, Susan
MacDonald, Ann Menzies and Alison Denholm had previously withdrawn
because of Western's involvement in the European Club championship.
Today's matches in the European Club championships are:
Men (at Linwood) -- Racing Club of France v Whitchurch (Wales), Minsk
(Belarus) v Grammarians (Gibraltar), Stockholm (Sweden) v McMahon
Kelburn, Wien Cobra (Austria) v T J Hostivar (Czech Republic).
Women (at Utrecht) -- Balsam (Leicester) v Inter Eurovil (Lithuania),
Western Klick Photopoint v Stad Francais, Berliner v Randalstown

* THE Australian selectors have made eight changes for their
all-important final pool game against Romania at Stellenbosch tomorrow.
Lock Rod McCall will captain the side which shows four changes each
among the backs and forwards.
Romania have called up left wing Adrian Lungu, who did not start in
either of their defeats by Canada and South Africa.
* AUCKLAND-BASED forward Sam Kaleta has been called up by Western
Samoa to their World Cup squad as cover for Shem Tatupu and Junior
Paramore, who were injured in the 32-26 win over Argentina on Tuesday.
* FRANCOIS Pienaar, the South African captain, took his players to the
townships of Port Elizabeth yesterday, the day after the announcement
that South African rugby is to plough 40% of its share of the World Cup
profits into township rugby.
* ENGLAND, pre-tournament 3-1 shots to win the World Cup, have drifted
out to 8-1 after two unimpressive wins. William Hill make New Zealand
15-8 favourites, with hosts South Africa 2-1 and Australia 3-1.
* CANADA lock Mike James is out of the World Cup after having suffered
a fractured thumb in the 27-11 defeat by Australia in Port Elizabeth on
Wednesday.
* ENGLAND intend to wait until tonight's official deadline before
naming their line-up to face Western Samoa on Sunday as they assess the
form and fitness of the players available. Captain Will Carling missed
the Italy match with an ankle injury and Dean Richards, who damaged a
hamstring on his arrival in South Africa two weeks ago, has not played
competitive rugby since April.
* KEITH Wood's playing career may have reached a premature end after
he sustained a shoulder injury in Ireland's 50-28 victory over Japan in
Bloemfontein. The 23-year-old Garryowen hooker has a history of shoulder
problems.
Manager Noel Murphy immediately contacted the Irish RFU in Dublin and
Blackrock College's hooker Shane Byrne flew out to Johannesburg
yesterday. Byrne is uncapped but has represented Ireland at Under-21 and
'A' level.

TENNIS: FRENCH OPEN
STEFAN Edberg's tennis career may not be over, but the Swede's chances
of earning admission to the sport's most exclusive club probably came to
an end yesterday, when he was beaten by Michael Stich in Paris.
Only four men -- Fred Perry, Donald Budge, Roy Emerson, and Rod Laver
-- have won all four Grand Slam events, and Edberg's hopes of emulating
them may well have disappeared after he submitted meekly to Stich 7-6,
6-3, 6-2 in the French Open.
With Pete Sampras failing in the first round in Paris, the only two
other candidates this year are Andre Agassi and Boris Becker.
The winner of six Grand Slam titles -- the Australian, USA, and
Wimbledon twice each -- Edberg has been frustrated once more in his
attempts to claim the French crown.
In the world top 10 for 10 years and ranked No.1 for 72 weeks in the
early 90s, the 29-year-old Swede has slumped to seventeenth and, for the
first time in a decade, he came to Roland Garros unseeded.
A finalist in 1989, when he lost to American Michael Chang, he has not
survived the second round in three of the last six French Opens.
''You always have to have hope, I know it is very difficult for me to
win here,'' Edberg said. ''I had a great chance in 1989. Every year it's
getting tougher, but you still have to have hope.''
While Edberg has not lost his desire to win, he appears to have lost
the respect of some of his opponents, including Stich. The German, also
a former Wimbledon champion, had little praise for the Swede after
beating him for the tenth time in 15 meetings.
''His game is the same as it was five years ago, only it is slower,''
Stich said. ''You can tell he has lost his self-confidence and it means
you lose the respect you used to have for him.''
But Edberg is a long way from bowing out. ''Everyone keeps asking me
if I'm going to retire. At least I've been enjoying what I've been doing
and I'm playing better tennis again. I still have the hope of winning
another Grand Slam.
''As long as I feel I have a chance I'm going to keep going. All I
know is I'm going to play this year and next, and that's all I can
say.''
Becker kept alive his Grand Slam hopes by abandoning his usual
big-hitting style to demolish American Jared Palmer 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.
The German world No.3, whose only career blot is his failure ever to
win a clay-court event, spoke calmly but confidently about his game.
''I've been playing very good tennis lately,'' he said. ''I've been
playing the best clay-court tennis of my life.
''It's impossible to serve 35 aces in every match on clay. What you
have to do is serve well, move well and hit the ball well on both
sides.''
Like Becker, the defending men's and women's champions -- Spain's
Sergi Bruguera and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario -- quietly went about their
business and advanced through to the third round.
Bruguera was untroubled once more as he dispatched compatriot and
qualifier Emilio Alvarez, who was reduced to serving under-arm in
desperation on match point, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.
Sanchez Vicario breezed past Sarah Pitkowski 6-3, 6-0, which might
have upset the home crowd had they not had Mary Pierce to cheer.
Pierce looked off song in her first set with Christina Singer of
Germany and angrily called on her family and coach to move seats so that
she could see them better after she went a break down. But the new
seating arrangements were obviously suitable as she turned the match
around to win 7-5, 6-0.
Austrian Gilbert Schaller, who defeated Pete Sampras on Wednesday,
bowed out after his second five-setter in 24 hours, losing 4-6, 4-6,
7-6, 7-5, 8-6 to Australian Scott Draper.
Britain's Neil Broad and his South African partner, Brent Haygarth,
reached the second round of the men's doubles by defeating the Czech
pairing of Martin Damm and Jan Kodes, son of the 1973 Wimbledon
champion, 6-2, 6-2.
* DEFENDING men's champions, the David Lloyd Club, will be without
Scottish No.1 Ross Matheson when they travel to Aberdeen to take on
Cults in the quarter-final of the Scottish Inter-Club Cup but the
Renfrew side should still have sufficient strength and depth to make the
last four.
In the women's event Dunfermline continue their bid for a record
eighth success when they tackle Peebles, with the winner either facing
Newlands or Waverley. Quarter-final draw:
Men -- Broughty Ferry v Newlands; Broomhill v Waverley; Inverness v
Giffnock; Cults v David Lloyd Club.
Women -- Dunfermline v Peebles; Newlands v Waverley; Western v
Whitecraigs; Cults v Dyvours.

NEWCOMER Double Oscar behaved badly in the parade ring at Ayr last
night but ran like a dream to win the opener. The two-year-old colt
trained by Mark Johnston led approaching the final furlong and ran on to
beat Newmarket raider Classic Lover by one-and-threequarter lengths.
Double Oscar runs in the colours of successful owner Ron Huggins and
is part owned by Dr Cedric Chan, head of equine surgery at Glasgow Vet
School. Dr Chan, who frequently operates on racehorses, picked out the
yearling at Goff's sales in Ireland last October and advised Huggins to
buy.
Wiltshire trainer Peter Makin has a 60% strike record at Ayr and won
again with Crowded Avenue (5-2).

KENT'S Aravinda de Silva will return to the Chester-le-Street crease
today aiming to hit 21 runs off 24 balls -- and complete the fastest
Britannic Assurance Championship century of the season.
The Sri Lankan Test star raced to the quickest Championship
half-century this term -- off just 33 deliveries.
He had Andrew Symonds' 93-ball ton for Gloucestershire against Surrey
at The Oval in his sights until a hail-storm ended play with de Silva on
79 off 68 deliveries and Kent at 144 for four.
Meanwhile, Symonds made 83 yesterday, but must have been wishing rain
had intervened at Hove after his side slid to 202 all out against
Sussex, with left-armer Jason Lewry taking a career-best six for 45.
Things were looking a little brighter for Gloucester by the close,
with the home side 113 for four.
Another bowler to return career-best figures was Glamorgan's West
Indian import Hamish Anthony, whose six for 77 helped send back
Hampshire for 324 at Cardiff.
Nottinghamshire opener Tim Robinson recorded the day's only century to
help his side reach 314 against Essex at Trent Bridge. His 101, his
second century in successive matches, was made in 196 minutes off 190
balls and included thirteen 4s.
England Under-19 player Anthony McGrath made 84 -- his first
half-century for his club -- as Yorkshire, for whom David Byas
contributed 66, reached 269 for six against Somerset at Taunton.
Worcestershire's Championship misery continued as the basement side
were sent back for 204 by visitors Surrey, who were 30 for one by the
close. Joey Benjamin took four for 47 and Australian Carl Rackemann four
for 56.

THE Scottish Claymores get one last chance to give their home support
a win when they take on Frankfurt Galaxy tomorrow afternoon at
Murrayfield.
Following last weekend's 16-3 loss to Barcelona Dragons the Claymores
(0-3; 1-7) have nothing more to play for but pride.
The Scots already have the upper hand on Galaxy, who still hold out
hopes of meeting Amsterdan Admirals in the World Bowl final, having
gained their only win of the season by 20-14 against the Germans in
Frankfurt.
''Franfurt are in a good position to make a run for the World Bowl,''
said Claymores head coach Jim Criner, ''but the road to Amsterdam goes
through Scotland and my players deserve a win.''

* SCOTS may be ticked off by nutritionists for not eating enough
vegetables, but when it comes to vegetarian cuisine -- surprisingly,
perhaps -- we're the tops. The deliciously creative fare at Jackie
Redding's Tigh na Mara guest house, near Ullapool, so impressed guests
they nominated her for the first-ever Vegetarian Hotel of the Year award
from Sanatogen. It amounted to a ''tip'' worth #1250 when Jackie went to
London to collect her prize as Scots regional winner -- and got an extra
#1000 helping for beating the rest of Britain's best.
As well as its gourmet Highland cooking -- many dishes with vegan
ingredients -- Tigh na Mara (House by the Sea) boasts some yummy scenery
by the secluded shore of Loch Broom, at Ardindrean. To book, phone
01854-655282. For a Vegetarian Society guide to the guest house, and the
five other regional winners, phone 0161-928-0793.
* WHEN the sink blocks or the washing machine springs a leak, you will
be glad to have the versatile Aquadapt to hand. This natty appendage
simply hooks on to vacuum cleaners, using the suction to suck up water,
ashes, broken glass, and other debris. It automatically cuts out when
the bucket-sized container is full. Available, with a set of tools, at a
remarkable #2.99 from Poundstretcher.
* WANTED: The Biggest Bodger in Scotland. Hardly the most flattering
accolade to bestow on Father's Day -- June 18 -- but the publishers of
BIY (Bodge It Yourself) reckon a free copy of their riveting spoof will
prompt plenty of noninations. Among useful tips for bodgers: there's
nothing like dynamite for shifting stubborn wallpaper. And for the owner
of an Orkneys lighthouse who's having difficulty papering his lounge --
a cylindrical room 8ft wide and 120ft high -- the remedy is simple: fix
velcro pads at 4ft intervals and abseil down the wall attaching
wallpaper as you go. Nominations (with examples of dad's bodging
achievements) to Two Heads Publishing, 9 Whitehall Park, Highgate,
London, N19 3TS, who will select three prizewinners. Or you can buy the
book for #4.99.
* TO mark the end of the Second World War National Museums of Scotland
plan an exhibition using personal mementoes. It will be staged at the
Scottish United Services Museum at Edinburgh Castle from July 17 to
October 29. The public is invited to lend NMS personal items or
collections connected with what they -- or someone they knew -- did in
the war.
The objects can be associated with the Armed Forces, Merchant Navy,
industry, munitions work, civil defence, refugees, or others living
through wartime. Museum staff will help set up the stands. Application
forms (to be returned by June 16) from Dorothy Kidd or Alan Carswell,
0131-225 7534.
* WANT to change your curtains or covers to match a re-decorated room,
but can't afford it? Once every high street had a dyer but in most parts
of Scotland they've died out. Now a Cheshire firm with 80 years'
experience -- including dyeing curtains for royal apartments -- is
offering a postal service.
Harry Berger claims major savings can be made dyeing everyday garments
and soft furnishings against buying new. For advice, phone 0161-485
3421, or write for an information pack to 25 Station Road, Cheadle
Hulme, Cheadle, Cheshire, SK8 5AF. For a colour chart, enclose #1.50.
* A CHANCE to put creative skills to the test is looming at the
Scottish College of Textiles. Summer workshops from July to September
cover weaving, machine knitting, drawing and painting, computer-aided
design, sewing and pattern-making. Open to anyone from secondary school
to retirement age, the two to five-day sessions are staged in fully
equipped studios and workrooms at the Galashiels college, recognised

Get ready for an offer you can't refuse -- because you won't be given
the chance to. Like it or not, junk mail is on the increase. Stephen
McGinty reports
THE Royal Mail was told at a London conference last week that junk
mail did not exist. It's a point which may interest the average UK
householder for whom one unrequested item of direct mail arrives every
four days. An annual total of 39 items is hardly worth clearing from the
doormat compared with Switzerland, where the average is 103, or America,
where the number rises by a factor of 20. However, more mail is in the
post.
The public may say 'why bother?'. Research has revealed that one sixth
of all junk mail remains unopened, and one third unread. Despite these
facts, direct mail is set to explode throughout Britain as more
companies switch from advertising on television to through-the-post --
cramming flyers, discount offers and samples through our letter boxes,
for it now seems we are fond of our free post.
At a one-day personal marketing conference, the Royal Mail heard from
a report it commissioned from the Henley Centre, entitled The Millennium
Post, that there was goodwill towards junk mail. Over half those
surveyed said there was too much, but could not say if it made them
angry. ''The main point of the research was that there is no such thing
as junk mail,'' said a spokesperson for the organisers, Generation
Associates.
''As long as it is personally addressed on a subject that is of
interest, or from a business that the public has worked with in the
past, then people are quite positive rather than negative. Now this is
quite something. It's a major swing in the opposite direction.''
Taste tests were conducted on what customers liked or disliked in the
style of envelopes. Simple white with the correct name and address rose
to the top of the list, while coloured envelopes with ''free
competition'' emblazoned on the front were swiftly binned. Don't worry,
companies and corporations took notes, as there were representatives
from Britain's 50 top retail firms.
Marketing has been moving towards direct customer contact for the past
few years. While television can increase customer awareness of a
particular brand, mail allows consumers to study different products. The
direct mail market has risen from #961m in 1981 to #2660m in 1994. Each
year the Royal Mail receives #1000m in business.
In Scotland, the market has expanded by 300% since 1992. Firms such as
Navigator, One-To-One, and Marketing Advantage have grown in this time.
One problem, however, has been securing talented copywriters for the
advertising mail packs, which has been tackled by the introduction of a
direct- marketing diploma at Napier University.
The key to continued success is providing information of interest to
each consumer. To discover these facts, one organisation, the Centre for
Consumer Interests, has posted out thousands of surveys around Scotland
and the rest of the UK. Included with #9 worth of Beefeater vouchers is
the chance to enter a free draw if you complete and return the enclosed
survey.
The survey has 168 separate sections with a total of 1849 sub-sections
and covers everything from shopping habits to family health.
The man charged with guiding the continued nationwide expansion for
the Royal Mail is market development manager Chris Dunk. He said: ''It's
just perfect that we are in the advent of one-to-one marketing, which is
the biggest thing since the 'new improved' idea.
''There will be an explosion . . . We have the money and expertise to
promote the use of a medium which we own. The one factor we have over
television is that we go to every household in the country.''
Well not quite every household -- those who would rather not waste
their time with unrequested soap offers, food samples, and insurance
details can have their addresses removed from any lists by writing
Freepost to the Mailing Preference Service* in London. All firms
registered with the MPS and the Data Protection Registrar are contacted
quarterly.
More than 300,000 people have contacted the service since 1983, with
the number rising by around 900 each week. The people who find junk mail
annoying seldom complain. Stewart Graham, a trading standards officer
for Strathclyde region said: ''We don't tend to get a great deal of
complaints about the quantity of junk mail. It's more to do with the
contents, such as companies making false claims about the prices.''
What disturbs the public is how companies get their addresses. Jo
Howard-Brown, of the Direct Mail Information Service, said: ''The list
market is vast; it has everything from racehorse owners to publicans.
You name it and they exist on a list. But there is a misconception among
the public that it's all culled from credit cards and telephone
directories.''
The list source is endless. Magazine subscription, product guarantee
cards and competition entries are only a few methods through which firms
gain addresses. The most simple and old-fashioned are geo-demographic
lists. These target consumers through postcodes. The more affluent the
area, the greater their potential interest in a particular product.
Lifestyle databases also exist. In Britain there are four main
companies which compile lists with more specific information, such as
hobbies. Twice a year, two firms, ICD and CMT, send out over a million
questionnaires. Different questions are sponsored by certain companies.
Officially registered lists are seldom sold but often loaned -- for a
fee.
To prevent other companies from duplicating the lists, ''seeds'' are
inserted -- the addresses of people who will report back to the company
which owns the list. The contents to be mailed to the public are also
vetted. ''The industry had to police itself, and it has made a good job
of it, otherwise the Government would have legislated against us, and
that would have been very destructive,'' said Howard-Brown.
The predicted letterbox bonanza will no doubt allow the public to be
the judge of this self-regulation.

Vacuum cleaners can now collect dust at a speed that breaks the sound
barrier, but, as Jenny Wilson reports, Scots seem happy with the
faithful upright model
FOR generations of Scottish housewives, Hoover has been virtually a
generic term for vacuum cleaner. One ''hoovers'' a house rather than
vacuum it -- even when the machine is made by a rival company.
Now the whole Hoover enterprise, including the Cambuslang plant with
its workforce of more than 1000, has been sold to the Italian firm
Candy. Candy has said it intends to develop the facility, though
declines to expand on its plans.
Hoover, however, is currently wooing the market with a streamlined
cylinder cleaner that looks as if it owes more to space shuttle design
than to old-fashioned cylindrical products.
The Hoover Alpina is, according to the manufacturer, the quietest
vacuumcleaner it has ever made, with a sound-absorbing system which
practically eliminates noise and vibration. It is also extremely
powerful (up to 1400 watts) and has a variable speed control which can
increase power to collect the most stubborn dirt. Its handle can be
extended to accommodate taller users.
It is made in Hoover's Cambuslang factory, which still continues to
produce upright models. The top-range Alpina (SC 190) is, so far,
available in three or four Scottish Power showrooms. And, like the
cheaper SC 188, has five-level filtration, including micro-filter and
carbon filter.
The Alpina's high filtration vacuum cleaner bags are made of special
high quality paper which, it is claimed, limits the size of dust
particles which pass through the bag into the air of the room. The
cardboard collar, joining the bag to the cleaner, is fitted with a
rubber membrane to improve dust retention.
The new Hoover has rivals -- notably the Dyson Dual Cyclone which
describes itself as ''the world's first bagless vacuum cleaner''. The
grey-bodied Dyson, too, looks utterly unconventional.
Its inventor, James Dyson, is also the inventor of the Ballbarrow.
Significantly, perhaps, the Dyson Dual Cyclone is featured in the Design
Museum, the Science Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well
as museums in the United States, Japan, and Europe. More than one
million machines have been sold throughout the world to date.
It bristles with innovative features, such as its fan/motor design.
The multi-bladed curved turbine fan, like the turbo-charger in a Formula
One racing car engine, allows the motor to produce ''incredible power''
for its size. Its five-stage filtration system comprises an outer
cyclone that spins out all large debris and 90% of fine dust at 200mph;
a shroud then acts as a dust separator between the outer and inner
cyclones; when the air and fine dust enter the inner cyclone they are
accelerated to 924mph (faster than the speed of sound) with
gravitational forces exerted on fine dust particles; the pre-motor
cartridge filter captures particles down to 0.01 microns and the
after-motor cartridge filter traps carbon dust-emissions from the motor
brushes.
The manufacturer claims that it offers relief for asthmatics by
removing viruses, pollens, and minute health-threatening particles that
stick easily to the lining of the lungs. It is used in hospitals.
Its clear bin -- made from unbreakable polycarbonate -- is also a
feature. Not only can one see the dirt spinning and settling, one can
also see when it's full. The clear bin detaches easily and is simple to
empty. Once emptied it can be cleaned with a mild solution of washing-up
liquid.
This apparent paragon of a cleaner is also designed to sit on stairs
and can remove stains while one vacuums, by use of special
''Zorb-It-Up'' powder.
In spite of all these cylindrical attributes, Scots, it seems, still
buy more upright vacuum cleaners. Maybe we are more thirled to
tradition. Maybe we simply find uprights more convenient to manoeuvre
around the house. Dyson, Electrolux, and Hoover are names to conjure
with here.
And a final thought: the man of the house can clean up on Father's Day
with a Dirt Devil Car Vac, a hand-held model with a 12-volt motor that
operates from the car's cigarette-lighter. It has a powerful revolving
brush which removes everything from embedded dirt and pet hair from car
seats. Its 16ft lead is long enough to service the back of an estate
car.

JOHN LINKLATER and a brave band of volunteers sample a new, alcoholic
lemonade drink
ALCHOLIC lemonade? This could represent a dangerous blurring of the
divide between hard and soft drinks, because a new product, Hooper's
Hooch, is being marketed by Bass Brewers with a 4.7% ABV, comparable to
most premium beers. It will retail at 89p over the off-sales counter,
and around #1.50 over the bar.
Our panel of tasters yesterday had difficulty registering the
alcoholic part of the concoction, and this is where it could have a
wicked sting in its otherwise innocuous tail. It tastes of lemons, like
home-made cloudy lemonade or of bitter lemons to most palates. But our
tasters wanted to know what kind of alcohol was involved. It is a
fermented alcoholic base to which real lemon juice and natural lemon
extracts are added, say Bass.
''It draws your jaws together,'' commented Roy Petrie, our design
executive, a man whose sturdy, bearded jaws look as though they would
take quite a lot to get drawn together. We concluded he found the taste
sharp. He went straight back to his pint.
''More a female's drink,'' suggested Margaret McCauley, daytime
manager at Babbity Bowster, whose premises we invaded for the tasting.
''Like peach schnapps. After a few, though, the effect at 4.7% might be
quite deceiving.''
''Like grapefruit juice,'' said Rosie Corbett, and our immediate
questions on whether she would drink it over breakfast met with a
surprising affirmative. ''After a heavy night, definitely.''
This struck a chord with that seasoned veteran of more than the odd
morning after, our columnist Jack McLean. ''A wee jag first thing, and
better than flat Lucozade,'' was his assessment. ''Well, you sure
wouldn't be ordering it at eleven at night.''
The brand name is a bit of a mystery to those of us who associate
hooch with clandestine stills and downmarket home brews. The
manufacturers evidently believe there might be a bootleg frisson in the
product, undoubtedly aimed at the younger end of the market. ''Above the
age of 18,'' they add, a little defensively, although the alcoholic
content is clearly labelled, as is the word ''alcoholic''. ''It refers
to the Hootchinoo tribe of Eskimos,'' a spokesperson offers, slightly
optimistically. ''They are well-known for distilling alcoholic drinks.''
Good try.
Pondering his Hooch a few moments longer, Jack McLean opines: ''It
tastes for all the world like when you mixed every drink as a kid,
picking up what was left from your parents' party the night before.''
One has to be forgiven for imagining most drinks must taste that way to
Jack, and I think he's wrong because there is a very specific taste to
Hooch. It is like cold Lemsip, the one you took for a headache at night,
and forgot to drink.
Our photographer Ian Hossack disagrees. It's like lemon barley water,
and it could bring a whole new dimension to five-set games at Wimbledon
if they adopted it there. Janice Boyle, who happens to walk in the pub,
confirms Hooch as ''quite refreshing for a warm day outside''. She is
also dubious of the brand-name appeal. We agree that Squeeze might be
better. After all, they claim it is a ''fun drink''.

THE Willie Quinn bandwagon took a quick acceleration at Brunton Hall
in Musselburgh last night when the Tranent middleweight won the WBO
Continental championship.
Amid the constant skirl of pipes and rattle of drums, the man they
call ''The Mighty'' stopped champion Paul Busby of Worcester at the end
of the ninth round. That must have been a relief to Quinn connections
who had seen their man live dangerously.
Quinn, whose record now stretches to 17 wins in 18 contests, looked to
have Busby in trouble in the third but then walked on to a straight
right which had him on the canvas.
Quinn also finished the round with a nick at the side of his left eye,
but it was the spur the Scot needed. His superior fitness was never in
doubt and he fought back with good, crisp jabs, always forcing Busby
back.
It was clear the Englishman was suffering from some kind of foot
injury. He kept looking at his corner and shaking his head but Quinn
said: ''I didn't see anything wrong with his foot. I think he had enough
and wanted out.'' Officially Busby was stopped because of the foot
injury.
It was the win the Tranent man wanted to push him to bigger things and
manager Tommy Gilmour will be putting his man forward for any British
title eliminators.
Quinn's younger brother Tommy made it a double for Tranent when he
outpointed an ageing Wayne Shepherd from Carlisle. Other results:
Bantam -- Rowan Williams (Birmingham) outpointed Neil Parry
(Middlesbrough) 8 rounds; Gary Burrell (Kirkcaldy) beat Marty Chestnut
(Birmingham) retired end of third; Light -- Mark Breslin (Barrhead) beat
T J Smith (Kettering) rsc 3rd; Light Welter -- Mickey Hall (Ludworth)
beat Steve McLevy (Glasgow) rsc 1st round.

MEMORIAL TOURNAMENT
GREG Norman emerged from hibernation to tie for the lead after his
opening round at the $1.7m Memorial Tournament in Columbus, Ohio,
yesterday.
The Australian, refreshed after six weeks off, demonstrated he is not
the type of player who needs to play every week as he shot six-under-par
66 in calm conditions on the saturated Muirfield Village course.
He joined American Mark O'Meara in the lead, one ahead of three other
Americans, Ben Crenshaw, Mike Sullivan and Jim Gallagher.
Only half the field completed the round yesterday, due to an earlier
rain delay which led to an unusual decision. Play began on time at
7.30am, but was halted 65 minutes later when rain rendered the course
unplayable.
Under normal circumstances, players would mark their ball and resume
after the weather cleared at the point they were at when play was
stopped. Instead, the 14 players who had completed at least one hole had
their scores annulled, and the tournament began again from scratch at
1pm local time.
A tournament official said this was because the rain made it necessary
to invoke the lift, clean, and place rule, and to move to pins to higher
positions on the greens.
Nick Faldo, the only British player in the field, was among those with
a late tee time. He was three under after 12 holes when play was
stopped.
The tournament lost one of its major drawcards when John Daly pulled
out to return home to Memphis, Tennessee, after his wife Paulette went
into labour with their first child.
However, the tournament features one of the strongest fields of the
year, including 37 of the leading 50 players on the world rankings.
Leading completed scores (Americans unless stated):
66 -- M O'Meara, G Norman (Australia).
67 -- B Crenshaw, M Sullivan, J Gallagher.
68 -- D Frost (S Africa), P Jacobsen, S Simpson, K Perry.
69 -- B Lietzke, S Elkington (Australia), M Brooks, C Beck, H Sutton,
W Grady (Australia).
Other score: 73 -- J Parnevik (Sweden).

Ross Finlay test drives a forward-looking Alfa Romeo
WHEN Alfa Romeo introduced the 145, there was a fairly stunned
reaction to a three-door hatchback which threw away the styling rule
book, but provided excellent cabin space and brought the price of buying
a new Alfa Romeo design down to Escort levels. Now the 145 has been
joined by the five-door 146, about which exactly the same can be said.
This is a typically up-and-down year for Alfa Romeo. The new Spider
attracts rave reviews, although it will not be on sale here until 1996.
The locally run British Touring Car Championship race team is foozling
the defence of the title won last year by the factory's own competition
department. And continental orders for the revised 155 are so strong
that right-hand drive production has been postponed.
Whether or not you think that Alfa Romeo should be involved in
ordinary family cars instead of concentrating on the sports and
sports-saloon end of the market, the sales and profits there are simply
not high enough. The 33, a model which always attracted mixed responses,
was the only Alfa so far to sell more than a million, and the 140-series
cars now have to do the same.
The 146 is mechanically identical to the 145. Its frontal appearance
is almost exactly the same, but the 145's dumpy back-end has given way
to a normal hatchback rear. The fact that the bottom line of the
windows, the alignment of the doorhandles, and the two side strakes all
dip towards the front accentuates the 146's thrusting-forward look, with
the inevitable corollary that the rear window is pretty high for
comfortable close-up reversing.
When it comes to rear passenger space, the 146 shows up most of its
direct rivals. Like the 145, the latest car has a very unusual fascia
which sweeps away in front of the passenger. If somebody in the front
passenger seat needed to shunt well forward to provide more legroom
immediately behind -- not a very likely prospect, given the amount of
rear cabin space anyway -- there would be no problem. The fascia is
reasonably enough designed, but you can see that this is one area in
which Alfa has trimmed its costs.
The base model at #11,695 and the L at #12,655 use the 1.6-litre
eight-valve version of Alfa's unusual and fairly long in the tooth
flat-four engine. The 1600 peaks at 103bhp, will hit 60mph in about 11
seconds, and has a test track maximum around 116mph. Fuel consumption
returns are 46mpg at 56mph, 24 at 75 and 27mpg around town.
While it has the familiar lumpy tickover and accelerating ''beat'' of
the flat-four type, the 1.6 does not demonstrate quite the performance
bite you would expect of even a family-style Alfa Romeo. The 1.7-litre
16-valve at #13,655 displays just that extra vigour on the road.
It has 129bhp to play with, an advantage which reduces the 0-60mph
time by a second and increases the maximum to 126mph. The benefit in
standing-start acceleration may not seem that great, but the
bigger-engined car is more responsive all round. Fuel consumption is
much the same: 44mpg at 56mph, 33 at 75 and 26mpg in city traffic.
The 1.6 L and the 1.7 are well equipped for their prices. Both have
anti-lock brakes, while the 1.7 adds alloy wheels, all-round disc
brakes, and an electric sunroof to the list of standard equipment. Only
the base model does without a 60/40 rear seat split. The wipers park
oddly, and gear change quality, as in all Alfas I have ever driven, is
only fair.
While safety and security measures are better than in any previous
mid-range car of the make, individuality is the latest Alfa Romeo's most
intriguing feature. Budget-price model it may be, but the 146 stands out
visually from the rest of the class.

COMPETITION for readers in the newspaper industry has never been
tougher. The cover-price war, triggered by the Murdoch empire, shows
little sign of abating. Soaring newsprint prices and a growing shortage
of supplies have compounded the pressure. We are all having to try a lot
harder to win your interest and retain your loyalty.
One intense focus of these growing competitive pressures is the
Scottish newspaper market, with a number of London-based titles
rediscovering readers they had chosen to neglect for years.
The Sun, never a tabloid to hide its primary colours behind a cloud,
shamelessly embraced the cause of Scottish nationalism, rather than
Essex Thatcherism, in its Scottish editions to drum up new business. Its
Murdoch stablemate The Times has a less sure-footed approach.
Its current billboard campaign, in Scotland as elsewhere, come
hithers: ''The Springboks, Wallabies, and All Blacks can't read him. But
you can.'' The reference is to Rob Andrew, England rugby captain for a
night this week, owner of that infamous white-shirted hand at
Murrayfield last year, who is filing daily reports to the paper from the
World Cup in South Africa. As a stroke of marketing genius that has all
the subtlety of an elephant with large thorns in all four feet.
The latest southern entrants in the Scottish newspaper wars -- the
Daily Mail and the Daily Express -- are using local contract printing
and advances in newspaper technology to increase their local content.
But they find it difficult, unlike the Sun, to leave their traditional
editorial prejudices at the Border. They come tartan wrapped, but with
an old, familiar agenda.
In that regard, the front page of this Wednesday's Scottish Daily Mail
said it all. ''Bank hits at home rule cost to jobs'' howled the
headline, above a story suggesting that Bank of Scotland governor Sir
Bruce Pattullo is warning that botched devolution could destroy
thousands of Scottish finance jobs.
The story was based on a loose -- so loose, I have to say, it was hard
to detect the joins with reality -- interpretation of remarks made by
Sir Bruce in the bank's latest annual report and accounts. Inside the
Mail was a commentary by an Edinburgh stockbroker wondering why it had
taken the Scottish business community so long to waken up to the
implications of the dreaded D word.
Where, I wonder, have the Mail and their tame broker been in the past
few months? Last November that same Sir Bruce Pattullo delivered a
highly significant speech to a Scottish Financial Enterprise dinner in
London. In it he made clear his view that people, not businesses, have
the votes in elections. People, not businesses, must decide what future
constitutional arrangements they wish to endorse.
The Bank of Scotland's governor went on to argue that leaders of
corporate opinion, like himself have, however, a responsibility to talk
to those proposing constitutional change, seeking reassurance that
business will not be disadvantaged by the outcome.
''Whatever our own personal political views, in our jobs as executives
of corporate bodies we naturally adjust to and conform with whatever
constitutional, fiscal, and regulatory regimes are in force at any given
time,'' he told his London audience.
Sir Bruce then made plain his central areas of concern should
devolution come to pass -- no interference with the free movement of
capital; no differential rates of corporate taxation; no differential
interest rates; no devolution of supervisory and regulatory regimes over
banks or other corporate entities.
The speech was a calculated attempt to avoid the trench warfare which
characterised relations between the bulk of the Scottish business
community and pro-devolutionists in the late 1970s and get a more
constructive debate under way this time round. In the months which
followed both the bank and SFE had meetings with Labour's senior
Scottish spokesman George Robertson and with the party's spokesman on
City matters Alistair Darling.
Now, in the bank's report and accounts, Sir Bruce writes, ''It was
encouraging that my earlier remarks drew the response from senior
politicians who promote devolution that it would not bring change in
relation to onerous technical issues such as banking supervision and
financial regulation, and the recognition that rates of corporation tax
required to be the same throughout the whole of the UK.''
He goes on to say that, of course, uncertainties still abound in this
and other areas, like the future of the European Union. Earlier he
restates the obvious: that ill thought-out change creates uncertainty,
which is anathema to financial markets.
But nowhere in his latest remarks does he indulge in the wanton
scaremongering favoured by the Mail. Nowhere does Sir Bruce mention the
word ''jobs''. Nowhere does he talk, as some business leaders did in the
seventies, of shipping operations south wholesale should a Scottish
Assembly become reality.
Needless to say, the men on the Mound are not best pleased with the
Mail at the moment. Sir Bruce is reluctant to get involved in a public
wrangle. But Grant Baird, the man in charge of Scottish Financial
Enterprise, is blunt.
''There is nothing in Sir Bruce's statement in the bank's annual
report which differs in substance from what he said at SFE's dinner last
winter,'' he told The Herald. ''The Mail has chosen to put a different
spin on it, for its own ends.'' You can be sure that Baird, whose
chairman is Jack Shaw, one of Bank of Scotland's two deputy governors,
was speaking with Sir Bruce's full authority.
I would be the last person to suggest that the Scottish business
community is bursting with enthusiasm for constitutional change. But the
current mood of measured realism characterised by Sir Bruce Pattullo is
infinitely preferable to some of the hysteria which attended Scotland's
last attempt at reform in 1979.
Then the likes of Lord Weir, Gerald Elliot of Christian Salvesen,
David Nickson of Collins, and Sir Eric Yarrow of the family naval
shipbuilding business would happily have filled the front page of the
Mail, day after day, with dire warnings of the consequences of
constitutional change for jobs, businesses, and the future of life as we
then knew it.
Subsequently, the Weir Group had to be rescued from total financial
collapse by, among others, the Scottish Development Agency. Salvesen
gained a market listing but became, in Scottish terms, a pale shadow of
the corporate presence it once was here. Yarrow became part of the GEC
empire and employs a lot less people now than it did then, thanks to
defence cuts. And Collins was bought by Rupert Murdoch and is currently
trying to sell its manufacturing operations at Bishopbriggs.
So much change and uncertainty. But, unless I blinked and missed it,
no constitutional change at all in those intervening 16 years. If the
Mail has to manufacture scare stories like Wednesday's maybe the debate
really has moved on.

THE latest phase in the growth of a factory which faced closure three
years ago came yesterday when its new product rolled off the assembly
line.
Volvo Truck and Bus at Irvine was under threat as the recession bit
into the industry but is now in the middle of a #6m investment programme
designed to boost building capacity by 60% and raise the workforce above
the 500 mark.
The first Volvo FH truck to be built in Britain was unveiled at a
ceremony in the Ayrshire factory then handed over to Mr Gerry Atkinson,
chairman of Scottish haulage group Maxi.
By the end of next year truck capacity will have been boosted to 5500
units a year with bus production increased to 2500 units.
General manager Winston Wright praised the efforts of the workforce in
turning the factory around and added: ''When completed, Irvine will be a
more modern, more efficient and more flexible plant and will have become
the largest heavy truck and bus plant in the UK.'' Products from Irvine
serve the growing UK industry are exported throughout the world

FOR those who argued against the pernicious erosion of our privacy and
the consequent misuse of the information that the introduction of CCTV
cameras in the streets of our towns and cities would wreak, the impulse
to cry, ''Told you so!'' in respect of Ettrick and Lauderdale District
Council's crime prevention committee seeking access to such video
evidence ''to spot litter dumpers'' (May 31) would be irresistible if
the subject weren't so serious.
However, I doubt if even the most scrupulous civil rights campaigner
is less-than-amazed at the speed, not to say arrogance, of events since
CCTV's introduction.
But of course, I'm just paranoid, with nothing better to do than worry
about whether my grandchildren's children will have to answer a three
o'clock in the morning knock on their door in order to prove to members
of a ''national security watch'' that they have nothing to hide! Such a
thing could ever happen!
Yet as recently as last winter (The Herald, November 12), Chief
Constable Leslie Sharp suggested that ''council reorganisation might . .
. mean the police having to get more involved in co-ordinating some
strategic services''. I recall, too, the chief constable's ringing
endorsement of such a force in the role not only of ''co-ordinating the
various agencies and organisations'' but also ''perhaps even stimulating
them'' (my emphasis)
As in many other areas of modern, technological life, if the means
exist whereby power can be amassed by one section of society, inevitably
it will be -- and, today, information is power. And we all know about
absolute power -- or do we?
The political naivety and unthinking acquiescence which afflict our
country at present will, at some future date, as sure as Big Ben will
one day strike thirteen, cause those with no use for their freedoms to
reflect ruefully and wonderingly on the last decade of the twentieth
century, when Ettrick and Lauderdale rid their streets of garbage.

IT IS immeasurably disappointing to see the speed with which you and
the rest of the British media have rushed to publicise the report by two
learned and highly paid professors who are reported as pontificating, at
great cost, that crime is not caused primarily by poverty. For decades
this has been blindingly obvious to any thinking person and it did not
need a high-priced research study.
The worthy professors are apparently quite content to state the
obvious but are not in the market for identifying the underlying reason
for the effects that they claim to have isolated. None the less they
appear to have asserted that the mass media are not to blame for the
increase in crime. I wonder why?
Perhaps you could explain to your readers why the professors -- and
you and the rest of the British media -- have not given comparable
publicity to, but have never even mentioned, the vital work carried out
in Canada -- work which studied the level of crime, in many different
parts of the world, before and after the introduction of television.
It demonstrated that, without exception, the introduction of
television into every region or country that had previously been
''deprived'' was followed immediately by a massive and continuing
increase in crime.
Perhaps the professors might ponder the coincidence between this
finding and their puzzled acceptance that the crime rate in this country
and others has increased markedly since 1950. In December 1949 the BBC
announced that its then current transmitter expansion programme would
reach 75% of the people.
To my knowledge, the only organ of public information that has even
mentioned this seminal Canadian work has been the International Herald
Tribune.

THIS country can ill aford to lose police officers of the calibre of
Leslie Sharp, who holds firmly to the basic principles of British
policing as known, appreciated, and admired since the days of Robert
Peel.
I joined the City of Glasgow Police in 1934 and served with pride
until my retiral in 1968. From my earliest days as a constable on a
Gorbals beat to the end of my service, police duties were clearly
defined as: (1) the protection of life and property; (2) the
preservation of the peace; (3) the prevention of crime; and (4) the
detection and apprehension of criminals.
I hear Leslie Sharp saying: ''So what's new?'' And, at the age of 81,
I can reply with confidence: ''Absolutely nothing!''
The changing pattern of central and local government support of the
police has allowed security firms to play an increasing role,
particularly in the protection of property. They may vaguely appear to
be involved in the protection of life, but the ultimate responsibility
in that field rests with the police.
Leslie Sharp rightly shoots down any suggestion that whoever pays the
piper calls the tune, and stresses the dangerous imbalance that such a
policy would inflict on an unsuspecting public.
Our system has always been policing without fear or favour in all
sections of society, and thereby maintaining the trust and co-operation
of the public, without which the police can not guarantee the high level
of service which is the public right.
Since 1938, when the first Glasgow chief constableship knighthood went
to Percy Joseph Sillitoe, some chief constables have earned the accolade
while for others it came up with the rations. Leslie Sharp has not been
surpassed in earning a knighthood.

REGARDLESS of any plans to turn Glasgow City Chambers into some sort

The present Mr Happy spread across the facade of this fine building
acts only as corporate graffiti. Comments from tourists in George Square

MURRAY RITCHIE in his rantings about Europe and Jacques Santer (May
27) seems to think he is describing the Garden of Eden and the subject
of the Second Coming respectively rather than the gruesome twosome on
whose behalf he condemns all who differ from him.
His first target is Norman Tebbit who is dismissed as ''an unelected
and pensioned off politician who lifts a living in the undemocratic
Lords at the taxpayers' expense''. Perhaps M Santer accounts for a few
shillings more of taxpayers' money than Lord Tebbit.
In any case, Lord Tebbit has a pertinent observation to make. M Santer
really has a cheek to order the UK about when his country -- which
covers less area than Central region, has fewer inhabitants than Tayside
region and does not even have its own economy -- is one of the sponge
nations of Europe. Perhaps Luxembourg and the other nations which have
been cadging from the UK (Germany and France have also been net
contributors) for years ought to put their money where their mouths are.
Murray Ritchie went on to say that EMU will not be an issue come the
Maastricht renegotiation and that John Major is performing acrobatics
for his back benchers. I suppose that is why there is continuing
discussion about a single currency which, if Germany has Europe's
strongest economy, would see German control as a condition of the
Germans pitching in with weaker economies.
The assertion that the EU is a capitalist market with a touch of
politics is the assertion that black is white. There is so much
political manoeuvring in and on the subject of Europe that the trade
aspect seems essentially disregarded despite its being the rationale for
our entry into the Common Market.
Finally, Murray Ritchie states that M Santer ''does reflect mainstream
thinking'' in the EU, asks whose view counts for more, and suggests that
the UK ought to acquiesce to M Santer's wishes.
Clearly only the views and wishes of M Santer mean anything to Murray
Ritchie but, on balance, whilst the UK is contributing to the European
budget and Luxembourg is taking from it, perhaps the view of John Major
counts for more among other people.

IN your supplement about the Auld Alliance someone must have forgotten

My mother, who is French, noticed that you had misspelt the French
word ''vieille'', which means old, and instead printed ''vielle'', which
means hurdy-gurdy.
This mistake wouldn't be so bad if it was in the supplement but its
bold presence on the cover makes it most amusing.
I hope that the French are not going to see it. It could be very

WHEN the definitive history of post-war Britain comes to be written,
Harold Wilson must be recognised as the outstanding Prime Minister of
the period. His policies, had they come to fruition, stood a better
chance of producing ''a nation at ease with itself'' than anything
devised by the present Prime Minister.
Wilson's legacy to the country should have been a strong economy
founded upon technology and full employment; a humane social policy
overseen by a respected public service sector ensuring that there could
never be, in this country, the sort of social and industrial wasteland
with which we are only too familiar today; a nation protected by a
realistic defence policy fully compatable with Britain's changed status
in the world order. He even made a more than respectable attempt at
reforming industrial relations.
James Callaghan frustrated Wilson's efforts in this field. It was
poetic justice that the downfall of his administration was, in part,
brought about by the intransigence of the unreconstructed trade-union
movement. He had to drink from the chalice he poisoned. James
Callaghan's place in history is assured as an unwitting architect of
Margaret Thatcher's victory in 1979.
Those who dispute my forecast about Harold Wilson's place in history
by claiming it for Margaret Thatcher misunderstand recent events. Her
period in office will be seen as a destructive throwback to the
political economy of Sir Charles Trevelyan and Sir Charles Wood, both of
the mid-nineteenth century, and of Neville Chamberlain in his
incarnation as Chancellor of the Exchequer in our century.
We must never lose sight of the fact that she would have lost her
first General Election fought as Prime Minister because of the havoc she
wrought on our industrial base, had it not been for General Galtieri
whose occupation of the Falklands enabled her to embark on her
Palmerstonian frolic in the South Atlantic.
The irony of the whole Falklands episode was that one discredited
leader in seeking to retain power by military opportunism enabled
another discredited leader to save her Government by the very same
means.

YOU carried two favourable articles on the Cottier Theatre and also a
review praising Nanna's Song.
I was present at the performance and endorse the praise for the
performers, indeed praise for effort beyond the normal requirements is
due.
I admired the professionalism which enabled the singer and guitarist
to remain apparently unperturbed and ''on song'' during the almost
constant raucous laughter and shouting from Cottier's own adjacent bar.
I doubt whether the performers received an apology as none was offered
to the audience. On the strength of my only attendance, I certainly
would not endorse the choice of the Cottier as an excellent venue.

YOUR editorial reflecting upon the Conservative defeat at Perth and
Kinross is surely an accurate judgment of Scotland's feelings towards
the present Government (May 27).
The fact that this observation coincides with the complete withdrawal
of all British Rail's Motorail services between Scotland and the South
-- totally without public consultation as already widely condemned by
readers of The Herald -- underlines the uncaring approach which appears
to exemplify the current Westminster attitude to the people it purports
to serve.
The buck-passing over the original Fort William sleeper decision,
followed by the pathetic attempt to substantiate absurdly-contrived
loss-making economics and then the spoilt-child reaction to the Court of
Session judgment by retaining the sleeper section only without the
Motorail facility, all contribute to my view that passengers -- and
their opinions -- are an inconvenience to be tolerated only through
undisguised gritted teeth.
If the Conservatives are to fulfil John Major's ambition to enter the
next General Election campaign in an atmosphere where the electorate
enjoy the much-vaunted feel-good factor, their public relations must
improve immeasurably, not a particularly difficult task from the current
starting point of zero.

SCAPEGOATING is a miserable pursuit for a grown politician to indulge,
particularly when he happens to be the Prime Minister of the nation.
Usually the real culprit in the relevant situation is not hard to find;
all too often it is the person blaming others for the mess. Thus we have
the Prime Minister directing his stumbling rhetoric and even more
confused reasoning at the serried ranks of those unfortunates caught in
the housing negative-equity trap. Speaking to businessmen (who else?) Mr
Major recalled, as if it had just come back to him, the housing chaos of
the late 1980s. There is no need to rehearse his description of events
as it was accurate enough and they will be familiar to any householder.
Nor should we attempt to explain what he meant by saying that negative
equity ''hit many people rather harder than most''. We have studied this
phrase, held it up to the light, upside down and sideways; it still
makes no sense. Nevertheless, Mr Major's purpose became clear when he
linked the lack of the feel-good factor to the boom and bust of the
housing market. In his view an awful lot of people took out mortgages
that were unwisely large. To adopt his own style, he's right. They did.
And look what happened.
All of this begs the question as to why those unfortunates took such
enormous risks. They embraced them willingly because the Government in
which Mr Major was an Economics Minister encouraged them to do so. Mrs
Thatcher's vision was of a nation of house-owners, but the vision was so
bright that it obliterated the mundane fact that not everyone's
situation was suitable for house ownership. But, as Shelter pointed out
yesterday, the right-to-buy policy and the deregulation of the private
rented sector reduced social housing stock and sent private rents
sky-high. For many people home ownership became the only way out, at
least until reality dawned. Interest rates rose, tax relief was
abolished, and the housing market began to sink. Put simply, the
Government is largely responsible for the shambles in housing and Mr
Major, as a willing participant in that Government, should accept the
blame and stop trying to shift it on to unwise investors, wicked
lenders, or even Mrs Thatcher. For that is a possible sub-text to his
speech. Could it be that Mr Major is actually criticising the Thatcher
Government of the time in the most oblique way? If this is the case, and
given the tangled thinking which characterises so much of what he says,
he really owes us the kindness of saying so in a straightforward manner.
And where is the feel-good factor? For in his way Mr Major is trying
earnestly to answer this question which puzzles his confederates who
appear to speak to nobody outside the confines of Westminster who is not
a member of their own party. Mr Major believes that it is wrapped up in
increasing competitiveness and increased jobs. Unsurprisingly, this is
unclear. He appears to be saying that it has been sacrificed to provide
competitiveness and jobs, though he can't bring himself to put it this
way. This won't do. Mr Major's message in Lincoln was disingenuous, and
that is as polite a word as anyone could apply to it.

ON Tuesday I was at a do at the School of Scottish Studies in
Edinburgh's George Square. Unlike Glasgow's George Square the Edinburgh
quad is on the road to nowhere, and it's easily avoided. In fact, it's
best avoided. The pain of George Square is too severe; I hadn't been
there for years, but it hurt all over again.
There may be the odd maverick architect prepared to defend what
happened to George Square in the 1960s but on this one public and
professional opinion is untypically united: it was ruined by the
University of Edinburgh, who demolished most of its eighteenth-century
buildings and replaced them with some brutish examples of sixties
functionalism.
I love the language of classical architecture: ''scrolled skewputts'',
''rusticated quoins'', ''pedimented gablet'', ''intercolumniation''.
Even if you don't know what these tongue-rolling terms mean you sense
that they describe something easier on the eye than ''a boxy block
raised on stilts . . . ribbed concrete towers at the ends''.
The Edinburgh volume of the National Trust for Scotland series The
Buildings of Scotland pulls its punches on the university's
redevelopment of its property. On the one hand, say the authors, the
sixties buildings ''pay no attention to each other or to the Georgian
survivors'' and on the other, they say, ''George Square and Buccleuch
Place have been mocked but not all destroyed''.
Technically they're right. The square was not all destroyed. The west
side remains as it was laid out by James Brown in 1766 -- a unified
terrace of Craigleith ashlar and ''cherrycock-pointed'' Craigmillar
rubble overlooking central gardens which, two centuries later, have the
green glow of a broadleaf glade.
In this remnant of small-scale Georgian architecture, the precursor of
the more assertive elegance of the great crescents of the New Town, is
the humanity which was mocked by the university's expansionist design --
mocked so bitterly that the pretence that the square is not
''destroyed'' is in itself derisory.
As I sipped my wine beneath the exquisite ceiling plasterwork of an
upstairs room in the School of Scottish Studies (a department fortunate
or humble enough to occupy one of the original houses) I marvelled at
the contradictions of the 1960s. This was the decade, as we've been told
again by the interpreters of the Rutter-Smith report Psychosocial
Disorders in Young People, which bred a generation of parents who bred a
generation of children who are now giving us problems. This was the
epoch which gave us the buildings we deserved and the children we
deserved.
When it comes to architecture I'm no Prince Charles. On the contrary,
I lament the fact that the Windsor-driven backlash against the dismal
extremes of sixties building seems to have paralysed the will of today's
architects. With a few exceptions, modern British architecture takes the
least controversial line of resistance and gives us little to offend,
but also little to excite. The same can't be said of modern youth.
Consider the parallel lives of Edinburgh University students and
Edinburgh University buildings in the late sixties. There were the best
of the germinating anti-establishment activists, the teenage Gordon
Browns, the youthful Lynda Myleses, and there were the nameless worst --
all flexing their intellectual muscles in the shadow not of David Hume
but the David Hume Tower. As the young challenged the old value systems,
their elders and betters trashed the infrastructure of the Age of
Enlightenment. Who set the example? There's no novelty in the notion
that people are the product of their environment, but it's a fragile
belief of mine that we're more profoundly affected by the human hunger
for beauty than can ever be measured by the socio-political consequences
of mean public housing or ugly institutional building. The contradiction
of the sixties (one of many contradictions) is that while it gave the
young beautiful dreams it housed them in hideous buildings.
The most plausible, deceiving, and alluring dream of all was the
fantasy that the possibilities of individualism are limitless. The young
were sold this idea by middle-aged gurus like the pernicious Timothy
Leary not because they wanted it but because they thought they wanted
it. In fact, the only thing the young ever want is the antithesis of
individualism: not to be different from each other but to be different
from their parents. There are rare young people who lack the gene of
conformity, but the mainstream experience of youth is a torment of
compliance.
We know that now, we didn't have the experience to know that then. Why
are the newspapers full of people like me recanting the foolishness
(while mourning the optimism) of our sixties selves? Because we are all
middle-aged revisionists. The other day I even heard Mary Quant on the
radio regretting the proscription of rote learning in schools. ''The
young like chanting,'' she said, ''They like doing things together. They
like ritual.''
Like team games; Girl Guides; even (why, wash my mouth with soap)
National Service. All the things that were discredited in the sixties
because they represented discipline, competitiveness, and obedience to
authority; as if the survival of any complex co-operative society
couldn't possibly rely on such repressive elements.
Well, it can and it does, although my gut hostility to the military
solution to anti-social behaviour will resist to the firing line the
ideals of National Service and boot camps. There are other routes to the
fulfilment of that hungry, youthful yearning for structure, motivation,
and conformity (my preferred vocabulary for discipline, competitiveness,
and obedience). But to the political mindset of the right and the
political expediency of the left they seem every bit as outlandishly
experimental as the vogues of the sixties.
You won't find me scoffing at social work departments who take young
offenders on safaris, or sociologists who say the quality of life of the
underclass in Castlemilk is poorer than the quality of life of
subsistance farmers in the state of Mysore. I think I glimpse what
they're trying to do, and what they mean: they're trying to alter the
world picture of the offender (which doesn't change when he's banged up)
and they're talking about spiritual poverty, which is the real crisis
for the disaffected young.
Once an old sixties liberal, always an old sixties liberal.

WHEN the going gets tough, the tough go shopping but not to the extent
that they used to which is bad news for retailers, particularly those at
the discretionary end of the market.
Fortunately for Boots it has a wide spread of businesses which enables
it to offset weakness in a particular sector. But chief executive Sir
James Blyth has no illusions about how tough the trading climate is.
Speaking yesterday, he said he saw ''no short term prospects'' for an
improvement in the retail environment.
His comments sparked a renewed sell-off in retail shares. W H Smith,
which has been battered by its recent profit warning lost a further 7p
to 345p. Although it operates in some of the most competitive consumer
markets, Boots continues to prosper aided by product innovation,
enhanced operating efficiency and good customer service.
In the year to 31 March 1995, Boots increased its profit before tax
and exceptional items by 8.4% to #525.6m, in the middle of City
expectations. Sales were 3.4% ahead at #4308m.
Boots the Chemists (BTC) remains the star performer in the group. It
achieved record profits last year of #349.7m, a rise of 8% on sales, up
3.9% on a like-for-like basis. A major success in the period was the
relaunch of the entire Boots No.7 cosmetics range aimed at taking the
product profile more up market competing with the likes of Max Factor.
Despite price increases of around 10%, sales have rocketed by 40%.
BTC managed to increase its market share in toiletries,
over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and dispensing business despite growing
competition from the major supermarket chains, Lloyds Chemist and
Superdrug.
Elsewhere, Halfords extended its market leadership of the cycles and
accessories market helped by new product launches. It showed underlying
sales growth of 4% in what was a flat market. The business is being
steadily moved out of the High Street to more cost-effective sites
out-of-town. The garage servicing business recorded a smaller loss.
Boots Opticians continued to hold its own in an increasingly
competitive market. The contract manufacturing business reported higher
profits helped by improved productivity and good cost control. Capital
expenditure in the business was a record #22m including investment in
toiletries production in Airdrie.
Childrens World made its first profit of #500,000, with a stronger
performance in the second half. Plans are afoot to extend the geographic
coverage of the business. The DIY businesses continued to give cause for
concern. A G Stanley increased its losses to #8.5m from #1.2m despite
higher sales. Market share declined in the key areas of wallcoverings
and paint. New management has been installed to try to improve the
situation.
Do-It-All sales were 4.6% below those of last year but there was a
more encouraging performance in those stores which have been remodelled.
Boots share of the loss at #6.3m was #4.3m better than last year before
exceptional costs. On the basis of the DIY performance, City analysts
downgraded their profit forecasts for the current year to around #530m.
Boots' coffers continue to be swelled to the point where Sir James
said that it was becoming a problem knowing what to do with it all. Net
cash was #517.2m at the year-end.
Sir James re-emphasised that the company would only consider making
acquisitions where they create value and in its existing business areas,
in particular it wishes to build up its OTC medicines business in
Germany.
There is the possibility of more cash being returned to shareholders.
The final dividend was raised by 13.3% to 17p after a final payment of
11.65p.
Ahead of Sir Richard Greenbury's report into executive pay and
options, Boots has decided to change its directors' bonus schemes and
contracts. Share options are to be dropped, executive contracts are to
be reduced from three to two years and a new long term scheme is to be
put in place that will provide bonuses half in shares and half in cash.
Boots is one of several responsible companies which wish to take on
board concerns expressed by shareholders and the general public about
executive pay and conditions of employment. However in the case of
Boots, its superior trading performance over several years in highly
competitive markets means that there is little quarrel with the board's
remuneration.
Boots shares dropped 8p to 510p where they yield 4.2%.

STAKIS is so confident about the continuing success of its hotel
activities that it was talking of spending #50m in the current year on
expanding the activity. That was on the back of divisional profits in
the half year to April 2 jumping 31% to #13m as a result of the
combination of rising occupancy and improving room rates.
The casino side of the business, however, had a somewhat bumpier ride
with a 3% reduction in contribution to #6.5m.
This slide in revenues reflected the possible impact of the National
Lottery. Chairman Richard Cole-Hamilton pointed out that the scratch
card in particular could have been responsible for the less than
expected increase in the cash drop -- the amount of money converted into
gaming chips. The drop rose #5m to #132m equivalent to a rise in spend
per visit from #119 to #135 with organic growth of only 2%.
A former Clydesdale bank chief executive, Mr Cole-Hamilton became
chairman after the retirement of company doctor Sir Lewis Robertson who
rescued Stakis after it had over-extended itself in the late 1980s. He
is also a non-executive director of Caledonian Publishing, owner of The
Herald.
Overall pre-tax profits increased 74% to #11.5m helped by a #900,000
profit on the sale of the stake in Ashbourne House.
The 39 hotels saw most improvement in London and southern England as
the local economies continued to recover from recession. Scotland was
slower although leisure activities at the Dunblane Hydro and at Dunkeld
are showing exciting potential as is Coylum Bridge.
Chief executive David Michels said yesterday that Glasgow was
''over-hotelled'' although Edinburgh can take another two because of its
greater exposure to business and tourism -- Stakis has just opened the
#7.2m Edinburgh Airport Hotel. He is concerned that Glasgow is suffering
the same fate as Leeds which has taken nine years to recover from
over-capacity.
Although occupancy outside London is the highest in the industry at
66.4%, up 3.1%, the average room rate at #43 although up 3% is still
about #4 down on the peak period of the late 1980s in real terms after
allowing for inflation. Mr Michels is hopeful of making some further
improvement in the current half year.
While there is a strong probability of building a hotel on a
greenfield site in Belfast, there is no likelihood of straying outside
the British Isles -- Mr Michels' earlier career with Hilton has made him
fully aware of the problems of going outside Britain and there remains
plenty of scope in the UK where Stakis is the fifth largest hotelier.
Stakis rather surprised the gaming industry when it introduced a #10
fee for new members last year. That has resulted in an 8% fall in
attendances to 982,000 and the effect will be studied once a full year
is completed.
The future for the activity does look good on several counts. One is
that the National Lottery has made gaming more acceptable while the
regulators are taking a realistic view of what is a very controlled
industry and which is probably ''cleaner'' than anywhere else in the
world. There are 118 casinos in the UK of which Stakis has 23. It is the
second largest operator after Rank's 26 and ahead of Stanley Leisure's
21.
Two new games are now permitted, casino stud poker and super pan 9 to
complement the traditional dice, roulette, blackjack and punto banco. It
seems probable that the maximum number of gaming machines may be
increased from two to six per casino with much larger stake than the
present maximum of 20p and limited advertising may be permitted while
the 48-hour membership ''cooling off'' period may be altered.
Casino profits are remarkably stable outside London where high rollers
are fewer in number while the average win percentage is just over 18%.
In the last 18 months, Stakis has spent #112m on acquisitions and
development which has left debt at #116m, gearing of 33% and interest
cover of just over three times.
Full-year profits seem likely to improve from #20.1m to #29m or so
which would leave the shares at 86p trading at 15[1/2] times likely
earnings. The interim dividend has raised 15% to 0.75p with a 1.9p total
possible for a 2.8% yield.

THE DECISION by the Bundesbank not to cut German interest rates
boosted the mark against both the pound and the dollar.
The pound lost 1.42 pfennigs to DM2.2588 but it gained almost 0.70 of
a cent against a weak dollar at $1.5950.
Sterling's trade weighted index rose by 0.5 to 84.8.
The absence of further central bank intervention and a generally weak
set of US economic data served to undermine the dollar in European
trading. Having fallen through support levels against the German mark
the decline accelerated.
The May National Association of Purchasing Management index was much
lower than expected at 46.1, its lowest level since May 1991, and
compared with 55.2% in April.
A major problem for the dollar is seen as the dearth of private demand
to plug the gap left by structural outflows like the chronic US current
account deficit.

VIRTUALLY all the relevant economic data out since the Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke put interest rates on hold at his last
meeting with the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, on May 5
appears to have justified his stand, taken against the advice of the
Bank.
The City will have to wait until the minutes of that meeting are
released on June 21 to find out exactly what took place but meantime the
evidence continues to mount that rates will be left as they are at the
next meeting on June 7.
This, at any rate, is the widely held belief in the City and was
strengthened yesterday with the release of the latest survey of UK
purchasing managers from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply,
regarded as yet another key indicator.
The survey indicates that the rate of expansion of the manufacturing
economy slowed sharply in May. The seasonally adjusted Purchasing
Managers' Index, an indicator designed to provide an overall view of
manufacturing, registered 52.0 in May, implying modest expansion. But
because it fell sharply from April's reading of 55.4, it represents a
significant slowdown in the rate of growth of production.
The reasons given by purchasing managers for the slowdown suggest that
nearly 14% of companies reduced output in response to a slight decrease
in new orders during May. Weaker domestic demand was generally cited as
the main cause of its deterioration in order books, but evidence
suggests that exports continue to strengthen.
It is not suggested that growth is slowing dangerously but that it is
returning to more sustainable levels, allowing the Chancellor to at
least defer lifting base rates from their present 6[3/4]% level.
However, there are still price pressures at work and the CBI, in its
recent industrial trends report, said that a some point an increase in
rates this year would be needed to offset the rise in raw material
prices. Sterling's weakness is a factor here and could prove a crucial
factor.
Moreover, despite lower purchases, total demand for materials and
components continued to exceed the production capacity of many
suppliers, reports the Chartered Institute. This was reflected in the
timeliness of supplers' deliveries. Just over 25% of purchasing managers
faced longer delivery times compared with April while less than 3%
enjoyed an improvement. Shortages were particularly common for
electronic components, but also for a wide variety of other commodities
and manufacturing inputs.
These shortages and capacity constraints were reflected in price rises
for many goods purchased in May. Pressure from suppliers, together with
the weakness of the pound -- which continued to feed through to import
prices -- resulted in nearly half of all purchasing managers surveyed
facing an increase in prices during the month.
This is the possible inflationary threat which will have to be
considered by the Chancellor when he weighs up the pros and cons on
interest rates. However, the CIPS prices index did fall from April's
record 80.6 to 75.8 in May despite the continuing price pressures in
manufacturing industry.
The City, though, finally became convinced that the Chancellor would
not change his stance with the recently released slight downward
revision in the first quarter GDP growth figures, now estimated to have
risen by 0.7% from the last quarter of 1994, compared with an initial
estimate of 0.8%. The Chancellor, in holding interest rates down, took
the view that first quarter GDP statistics may have been overstated as,
indeed, proved to be the case, if only marginally.
Goldman Sachs' economists point out that the big picture is one of a
peak in the quarterly growth rate of GDP in the second quarter of 1994
and a gradual slowdown in each of the subsequent three quarters. With
the full effects of the monetary tightening still to be felt, the
Chancellor may well feel even more strongly now than he did earlier last
month that monetary policy has been tightened sufficiently to get the
economy to slow to a sustainable pace.
Certainly, nothing has occurred since then to seriously contradict
this view and the Purchasing Managers Survey provides further backing.
In other words, if the Chancellor saw no reason to lift rates in May, it
is difficult on the evidence to see why he should decide anything
different in June. It will be interesting to see if the markets are
wrongfooted and Mr George has his way, assuming that he will be urging
an increase in base rates.
The weakness of the consumer sector of the economy and housing in
particular shows up in a fall of 0.7% in Nationwide's seasonally
adjusted house price index for May compared with April, leaving prices
just 0.8% higher than a year ago.
However, while confidence remains generally fragile and is not helped
by the threat of further base rate rises or the forthcoming much
criticised changes in income support, the Nationwide continues to expect
a sustained but modest improvement to begin in 1996, driven primarily by
a recovery in net disposable incomes after the weak growth over the past
five years.

THE French consul in Scotland, M Jean-Claude Richard, appears
determined to make the most of this year's 700th anniversary of the Auld
Alliance. Readers of yesterday's Diary will recall that M Richard has
ordained a Diary competition to celebrate the age-old friendship between
France and Scotland.
The star prize is two Air France tickets to Paris. M Richard has now
come up with a further prize of dinner for two at Le Chardon, the chic
French restaurant in Whitehouse Terrace, Edinburgh. There may well be
more goodies to be won as the consul puts the arm, in the nicest
possible way, on more of his French connections.
So what do you dear readers have to do to be among the prizes? Simply
send us your anecdotes, or personal memories, or stories which capture
the spirit of the Auld Alliance.
For instance, if Sir David Stirling, the Scottish soldier and founder
of the SAS, were still alive he would qualify for his story about the
time he met General de Gaulle. It was in 1941 when the French were
defeated but de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces, still had his
Gallic pride.
Stirling was given the job of telling de Gaulle that the Free French
parachute regiment was to be merged and come under British control. The
meeting had not progressed too far when de Gaulle uttered his favourite
phrase: ''Non, absolutement pas.'' Stirling swore quietly, but not
quietly enough that the general could not hear him.
Haud on, said de Gaulle in French, is that a Scottish accent you've
got? Yes, mon general, Stirling replied, I am Scots through and through
and brought up in the great tradition of the Auld Alliance between
Scotland and France against the English.
Oh well that's different, said de Gaulle. Let's talk about this. And
half an hour later Stirling hd persuaded the big man to merge the French
paras into the British, sorry Scottish, commandos.
In a similar vein, Mike Ashmore of Biggar (who describes himself as
late of the Royal Scots) describes a visit by the First Battalion to the
town of Larzac in the South of France for a month's training. The troops
were quite looking forward to the experience, as were the officers.
But when they arrived, they found the local mayor had decreed the town
out of bounds to British soldiers because of a bit of bad behaviour by
the English regiment which previously had been billeted there. The Royal
Scots commanding officer sought an interview with the mayor, quoted
chapter and verse from the long history of the Auld Alliance, and came
out with agreement from the mayor that the ban was lifted. But with the
caveat that the Royal Scots had to wear their tartan trews when out on
the town.
Auld Alliance contributions -- of a military, sporting, or social
nature -- to the Diary at the usual address. Winners will be announced
before M Richard leaves later this month to become French ambassador to
Uzbekistan. That's a promotion for him, by the way.
Family at war
WE continue on a historical note with a wee look at Bonnie Prince
Charlie: Fact and Fiction, an exhibition which opens today at the
Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow.
The show has been put together by Bob Woosnam Savage, a Welshman, with
the aim of scotching some myths about the Jacobite story in general and
Charlie in particular. First the fiction put about by none other than
Billy Connolly that BPC was ''an effeminate Italian dwarf''. he was of
Scottish-Polish origin and was 5ft 10in tall. The exhibition doesn't
explore the effeminacy bit.
Second, the 1745 uprising, culminating in the Battle of Culloden, was
the last Scotland versus England battle. It was more a case of a family
at war, says curator Woosnam. BPC and Butcher Cumberland were cousins
and it was all about who was going to be in charge of the family
business, or monarchy of Britain.
Bonnie Prince Charlie wasn't all that bonnie later in life. He was a
drunken wife-beater. The portrait of him at 64 tells it all.
When Bonnie Charlie sailed awa' it was not a case of ''better loved ye
couldnae be''. His own commander, Lord George Murray, wrote a letter to
BPC after Culloden placing the blame firmly on his royal highness's
shoulders.
One thing is not in doubt in the exhibition -- how much the Duke of
Cumberland, King George's brother, detested the Scots. ''This vile spot
(Scotland),'' he wrote, ''may still be the ruin of this island and of
our family.''
* Our Hanoverian royal family continue to benefit from Culloden. The
BPC exhibition catalogue, posters, and leaflet feature a detail from a
painting called An incident in the rebellion of 1745. It is part of the
royal family's collection and each time it is used a payment has to be
made to the Queen's coffers.
Stamping ground
TO continue the historical theme let us turn our attention to efforts
to impeach the current person of German descent to occupy the throne.
A chap by the name of Robbie The Pict, self-styled cultural attache of
the Pictish High Commission, is trying to have our own dear Queen
charged with reset of the Stone of Destiny. To this end he is engaged in
an earnest correspondence with Buckingham Palace.
The palace deny any criminal liability and keep trying to tell Robbie
the Pict that they consider the matter to be closed. In a nice little
touch, Buckingham Palace insist on replying to his letters by calling
him R T Pict, Esq.

THE next few weeks will be crucial to the future of the UN role in the
Bosnian war. Lord Owen, now resigned as a UN negotiator, believes that
unless there is definite progress by the autumn the UN troops should be
withdrawn; but there is a more immediate crisis in the shape of the UN
hostages. As in all such situations there is an element of bluff, but
the reaction of the French and British Governments in augmenting their
existing forces so as to strengthen their capacity to defend themselves
is a sign that they are not willing to back down. That was also the
message from the House of Commons on Wednesday. The sort of firepower
which will be at the disposal of the rapid reaction force now forming
further underlines this firmness. The additional force may, however, be
read as providing the essential element of weight necessary to ensure
that were a withdrawal agreed it could be carried out without
significant casualties. The Bosnian Serbs, who have successfuly resisted
every UN (and Nato) attempt to overawe them, may not be impressed by the
latest developments. That is especially so now that it is clear that Mr
Clinton's apparent willingness to commit some US ground troops to Bosnia
is heavily qualified and, as a Pentagon spokesman put it, does not
represent a change in American policy.
Mr Clinton's offer is limited, being designed to help either a planned
UN withdrawal, or temorarily to withstand an unexpected but critical
situation which could compel withdrawal, or protect a re-disposition of
the existing UN forces. None of that amounts to a definite commitment to
participate in the peacekeeping force, and it would be undertaken only
after consulting Congress. It has, however, been enough to stimulate a
powerful critical reaction from the President's domestic opponents. What
was designed as a modest sweetener to the British and French has been
found sour by other US politicians who articulate the country's common
fear of becoming involved in a Balkan replay of their experience in the
Vietnam war. The Americans do have air, naval, and marine units already
deployed in the Adriatic Sea, and their aircraft have participated in
the Nato air strikes. Anything extra is immediately identified as
escalation, a word with an ugly resonance for American ears in the
twentieth anniversary of the US withdrawal from Saigon.
In short, the Western powers, and the UN, involved in Bosnia cannot
depend on American military intervention unless their policy is admitted
to have failed either completely or in great part (hence the so-called
re-disposition). There seems little mileage in complaining about this.
Given the known influence of Muslim countries (particularly Turkey and
Saudi Arabia) on American policy in Bosnia, it seems obvious that the
State Department feels it has little choice but to remain on the
sidelines: domestic opinion leaves it no choice. This will continue to
dismay Bosnian Muslims but it helps reinforce the opinion that patient
negotiation remains the only way to settle this affair. In fact this
really remains Franco-British policy. Their own new commitments will
enhance the ability of existing units to defend themselves from direct
attack and the sort of swoops which netted the hostages. Their rapid
reaction force will have more powerful teeth but these will certainly be
necessary if there is an attempt to withdraw, especially as it could be
considered only if refugees, who might otherwise be exposed to
indiscriminate slaughter, were also brought to safety. This has already
been a thoroughly evil war and it shows no sign of changing its
personality.

CONGRATULATIONS to all concerned in the recent re-fencing of
Blythswood Square's garden. The new, black, industrial, plastic-coated,
metal-mesh fence perfectly complements the sandstone Victorian
buildings, and is the ideal techno-era foil for nearby architectural
feats by Mackintosh and Thomson.
The rusting fence-posts, cleverly redolent of late twentieth-century
scrapyards and alsatian-patrolled building sites, provide a fine,
brutalist counterpoint to the elegant wrought-ironwork elsewhere in the
square.
Particular praise, also, for the roll of excess fencing abandoned in
the south-east corner, and for the retro-look distressed litter baskets.
The whole effect is so correct for our times that I propose we
surround the entire city with identical fencing, lock the gates, and
throw away the key, thereby preserving everything for eternity.
I can hardly wait for the Year of Architecture. Never mind Mr Happy:
I'm Mr Disbelieving.

THE sordid story of Ayrshire and Arran Health Board's decision to
privatise the care of elderly dementia patients dates back to the
gung-ho days of Michael Forsyth at the Scottish Office and Bill Fyfe as
his trailblazer-in-chief.
Ayrshire, which had not been consulted on the matter, was to be the
showpiece laboratory for trusts and contracts with the private sector.
So, when decisions had to be taken about replacement of the antiquated
Ravenspark Hospital in Irvine, the health board saw it as an opportunity
to do another private deal.
In a letter dated January 10, 1992, the board's chief executive, Jim
Eckford, wrote that he was ''currently considering proposals from the
independent sector for the care, under NHS contract,'' of the Ravenspark
patients. He anticipated that ''the entire replacement of Ravenspark
will be achieved in 1993''.
The board, Mr Eckford wrote, ''is committed to caring for its
long-stay elderly patients in smaller domestic-style accommodation,
closer to their own communities and families''. That is a clear-cut
statement of policy which is worth bearing in mind, as the tale unfolds.
Ten days after that letter was written, BBC's Panorama programme
exposed conditions in certain private nursing homes for the elderly. One
of the homes featured, in London, belonged to a Leeds-based company
called Burley Health Care plc. This was the company which Ayrshire and
Arran Health Board had just selected as the perfect partners.
Following the General Election result in 1992, resistance to trusts
crumbled and health provision in Ayrshire was divided between North and
South Hospital Trusts, as well as a Community Health Care Trust. The
newly-formed Community Trust looked afresh at the proposed Ravenspark
replacement plans, and did not think much of what they saw.
What need was there to bring in a private company based in Yorkshire
and without a presence within 200 miles of Ayrshire to do what was
essentially an NHS job? Was the Ayrshire Central Hospital site in Irvine
the right place for a development of this kind, when many of the
patients came from the ''Three Towns'' -- Ardrossan, Saltcoats, and
Stevenston -- which show up in the health board's own statistics as
producing the highest proportion of patients with these problems?
The Community Trust concluded that a new facility in the Three Towns
was their preferred option, particularly since it could incorporate
other NHS services not locally available. They were convincing that the
health board/Burley plan for a 90-bed unit, far from being small and
local, was dictated by the scale needed to make it a commercial
proposition, and would result in patients being brought in from distant
South Ayrshire on order to fill it.
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board was having none of it. In spite of
mounting evidence that Burley Health Care was not exactly free of
problems, the health board's officials ploughed ahead with negotiations.
They repeatedly refused the Community Health Trust's request to be
allowed to put forward alternative proposals, claiming that they were
already contracted to Burley.
By then, however, it was no longer Burley Health Care they were
dealing with. That company had been bought over by Speciality Care ,
which is in turn an offshoot of Integrated Health Services Inc, a
Maryland-based corporation with a reputation on the US Stock Exchange
for generating high ratios of profit to investment.
So it was now the policy of Ayrshire and Arran Health Board that the
care of my most vulnerable constituents should be entrusted to an
American corporation, rather than to the directly-employed staff of the
National Health Service.
Their determination to pursue this course of action appeared
increasingly irrational to many observers; not least the Community
Trust, who were under the impression that looking after psycho-geriatric
patients was one of the tasks they had been brought into existence to
fulfil. Yet they were not even being allowed to tender for the contract!
While negotiations dragged on, the company underwent another name
change. The health board's partners are now Irvine Care, wholly owned by
Speciality Care and set up with only #1000 of assets. But last autumn,
Burley/Irvine/Speciality received a nasty shock, when the Community
Trust -- whose staff's jobs are at stake -- received very firm legal
advice that TUPE would apply.
For the uninitiated, TUPE is shorthand for the European regulations
(bitterly resisted by the Tories in general and Michael Forsyth in
particular) which guarantee that the terms and conditions of a job
transfer from one employer to another. It seems that Burley had not
built this inconvenience into their pricing, which gives us a fair idea
of where their profits were intended to come from.
Last November, it seemed that TUPE had killed the deal. Ayrshire and
Arran Health Board went to the Community Trust and asked if they could,
after all, take over the Ravenspark replacement project. The Community
Trust threw its hat in the air and immediately contacted Cunninghame
District Council. Within 24 hours, a site in the middle of the Three
Towns was agreed. The scheme would have included a range of NHS
facilities for the whole community.
The health board's sudden willingness to pursue this alternative
course of action was facilitated by a report from its nursing officer,
Karen Darling, on where the whole saga stood at that point. It stated:
''There is not a contract in place and anything or everything is open to
re-negotiation'' -- a precise negation of the grounds previously used to
frustrate the Community Trust's interests.
Then, as quickly as this shaft of light had appeared, it was blocked
off again. The health board climbed back into bed with Irvine Care. (Had
they ever really left it?) Last Friday, the contracts were finalised --
which again begs the question of what binding contracts, if any, had
previously existed. The Scottish Office brusquely turned down a final
plea from the Community Trust to block the deal, pending an
investigation of Irvine Care's credentials.
There are many, many questions to be answered and this story has a
long way to run. One which interests me is whether extra money has been
made available to Irvine Care to meet the TUPE bill. If so, this will be
in direct contravention of Scottish Office legal guidance last November
which stated that no such adjustment should be made.
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board have sold their souls to Maryland. My
constituents have lost the prospect of a first-class NHS facility. I am
told that the staffing plans are far below what one would expect in the
NHS. And, interestingly, one of the most bitter critics of what has
occurred is Aileen Bates, chairman of the Community Trust -- a Tory, but
one whose commitment to the NHS has never been called into question.
She told me yesterday: ''I am very, very disappointed that we were not
given the opportunity to tender. We have a superior proposal which would
have given a first-class NHS health care facility to Cunninghame, with a
lot of lasting benefits.''

THE letter ''x'' is a printer's invention. Originally the sound was
signified in writ by two ''c''s back to back, thus ''cc''. Old
technology can do this but new stuff can't, so unless you can't imagine
what I am describing you can't have the slightest notion of what I
talking about at all, and are therefore too thick to get to the end of
this column and will not pass the eccamination at all.
I have always enjoyed a wee burst of pedantry concerning the word
''flaccid'' which should of course be pronounced ''flaxid''. I enjoy it
now more that I am myself more flaccid than ever, but retain a rigid
point of view on the matter. I am hard-line, so to speak, on this point.
Holy God what am I writing of here at all? I am writing of exams.
This is the very time that exams are being taken by our younger
citizens. Most of the school boys and girls have finished them, the
Highers and such. When I was a teacher myself I was wont to enter the
foyer of the hell-hole in which I laboured with a cheery greeting to my
sixth-form register class.
''Youse'll aw fail!'' I would cry to the wan-faced applicants to a
life of never-ending scholarship. A lot of them did at one time. Today
of course there are enough exams that naebody fails. Everybody gets a
degree.
Part of the reason for this is the notion that everybody has potential
and that we should all recognise this. As large numbers of the denizens
of Possilpark, for instance, have the potential for positively Serbian
sentiment I begin to see what potential really is. Doubtless we all have
differing talents. For instance, I cannot drive. In fact, despite my
attendance for some years at the Allan Glens High School of Science and
Technology, I cannot put on a light switch. I exaggerate. I cannot put
one off.
I once earned 1% for maths. This was for writing my name. I then
earned six of the belt because I was first in five other subjects and
this meant I had not tried in mathematics. Hadn't tried? I had a mental
bloody hernia and enough regret to make Lord Jim breezy. I may say the
boys and dominies who could pass maths thought Lord Jim was a carpet
manufacturer. (Answer: Cyril Lord. Reference: obscure.) But the past few
months have seen the pale-faced youngsters absolutely seek wi' worry and
with complexions on them the colour of cauld keech.
It is not of course just the weans at school. I have a certain
sympathy with some of the weans at school, the boys and girls who stand
wetting themselves with their whole lives before them and that nonsense.
I have none at all for the students. So you failed to obtain the
Newdigate Prize or a starry double-first? Jings.
I recollect my mum sending me off just before my third-year
examination at the Dotheboys Hall up in Montrose Street, to the barber's
for a haircut and having to appear for the Diet of it all shorn like
Samson, a new shirt with a collar two sizes too big, and a sense of
foreboding which would do credit to the Ancient Mariner when the oceans
were heaving with, well, foreboding.
I used to be sent to a barber in the Duke Street in the Calton. The
barber looked like King George the Sixth, I remember, and had a similar
speech impediment, which he exercised with a gusto. ''Turn your
f,f,f,flipping, h,h,head, you l,l,little f,f,flipper!'' he was wont to
instruct, except he didn't stutter ''flipper''. He stuttered something
else entirely.
And so do I when I read some further farrago concerning examinations.
Do you know that more people pass exams, of whatever circumstance, than
ever before? Hardly surprising. We pass everybody anyway. Schoolchildren
have this Standard Grade in which the only way to fail is forgetting
your crayons for the colouring-in like. Degrees can be obtained in going
to the lavvy in time. Honours for using less leaves of the Andrex roll.
Polymaths like myself are denied our rightful place because every
damned thing I can do well -- playing the mouth organ, getting off with
nice girls, cooking a splendid Boeuf Wellington, doing keepie-uppie for
a half-hour, writing bloody books, and adding to the gaiety of nations
-- is ill-regarded by those who have went back to Yooni after their
divorce and squeezed an Educating Rita qualification past a mendacious
and venal halfwit bouncing with vulgar carnality and calling himself a
''further-education lecturer''. It wid make youse ill.
In truth I'm kidding on and couldn't care less. Eccept for one thing
at that. I haven't had to sit an eccam in years. Eccactly. Succinct.

TRAINSPOTTERS are expected to be out in force this morning along the
east coast rail line when an InterCity 225 streaks south on a
record-breaking bid.
The train will leave Edinburgh and travel through Newcastle to
Peterborough, attempting to reach the speed of 150mph to become the UK's
fastest passenger train.
Mr Brian Burdsall, InterCity East Coast's managing director, said:
''The 225 is the fastest and most powerful train ever to run in Britain
and produces 6300hp.
''Our aim is to show there is further potential for the development of
high-speed services on the east coast route.''
The record stands at 144mph set a decade ago by the Tyne-Tees Pullman
InterCity 125 diesel.
Railtrack East Coast is joining in the record attempt and Mr Bob
Clarke, director, said the event would underline the east coast main
line as the fastest in Britain.
''It also demonstrates the ability of the new railway businesses to
work together,'' he added.
The InterCity 225 will attempt to beat the record twice: between
Darlington and York, and then between Grantham and Peterborough, the
latter on the famous Stoke Bank where, in 1938, the Mallard set the
world steam record of 126mph.

William Russell explains why the battle to save the Star Wars studio
is crucial to the British film industry
IT IS a chicken-and-egg situation. Actors you don't need. Anybody can
be an actor. Directors can come from the theatre and direct films to the
manner born, as both Nicholas Hytner (The Madness of King George) and
Christopher Hampton (Carrington) have just demonstrated conclusively.
But without the technicians -- cameramen, electricians, carpenters,
plasterers, seamstresses, and so on -- one is in trouble, and without
studios there is no place for those craftsmen and women to learn their
skills.
Film studios, Michael Winner has argued, are not essential, because
films can be shot on location, which is only a partial truth. Some films
can, but not all by any means. Studios and technicians go hand in hand.
That is why the battle to save the historic studios at Elstree is so
important to a future British film industry. As to what constitutes that
industry, while obviously the more films made by British talent with
British money the better, it also involves having the facilities which
foreign film-makers and production companies can use.
Britain has two major working studios -- Pinewood and Shepperton. Both
are doing well, but if they are full there is nowhere for productions to
go, except abroad. A third major studio is needed, and Elstree should
fill the bill.
Ealing, the other famous studio, which belonged to BBRK who went into
receivership last October, has just been rescued by a #2m grant from the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts so that it can become the home of the
National Film and Television School. Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell
is expected to make the formal announcement next week when he is also
due to unveil his plans for the industry.
Ealing was, of course, home to the famous comedies from Passport to
Pimlico to The Lavender Hill Mob and The Ladykillers. There are also
smaller studios still operating at Twickenham and Bray, but they are not
suitable for major productions.
The Elstree story is complicated, and yesterday Hertsmere Borough
Council, in whose jurisdiction the studios fall, announced that they
would place a compulsory purchase order on the owners, the Brent Walker
leisure group, if they did not agree to sell them for future film use.
The council want the group to accept an offer by Twentieth Century Fox,
owned by Rupert Murdoch, which plans to use Elstree for its European
film-making base.
Paul Welsh, chairman of the Save Our Studios campaign, who is in
charge of Hertsmere Council's entertainments department, said that the
SOS campaign was set up in 1988 when Cannon, who owned Elstree, wanted
to sell. The risk was that the site would be lost to developers, and the
campaign attracted top-level international support from film-makers like
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who had made the Indiana Jones and
Star Wars films there.
Elstree has had film studios of one kind or another since 1914 -- one
of which, the Elstree Centre, is used by the BBC to make EastEnders --
and their presence was important to the prosperity of the town, Welsh
said. The site was purchased from Cannon by Brent Walker for #32.5m who
promised that, provided they could develop some of it for commercial use
-- it was sold to Tesco for a new supermarket -- the remaining 15[1/2]
acres would continue to be used as film studios and new stages built.
The campaign was wound down, but the new stages never materialised and
in September 1993, when the beleaguered leisure group announced they
were closing the remaining studios it was revived. Three sound stages
remain. Mr Welsh believes what Elstree needs is seven stages.
There have been running battles in the High Court between the council
and Brent Walker -- another hearing is due in the autumn -- and the
compulsory purchase threat is only the latest move in a depressing saga.
Mr Welsh said: ''Elstree is renowned throughout the world and people
abroad are amazed that we can allow a studio, opened in 1926, where
films like Moby Dick, Blackmail, Murder on the Orient Express and
television series like The Avengers and The Saint were made, to
disappear. At present Britain is losing work through lack of stage
space, yet Elstree stands idle.''
The trouble is that Twentieth Century Fox are only prepared to pay the
going rate for a derelict film studio. Brent Walker wants its
development value, a mythical figure, but one which allegedly it has to
ask for to satisfy its legal obligations to its creditors. What about
the promises given when it bought the site and was allowed to develop
part of it?
According to Mr Welsh, many of the technicians working in Bitain's
film industry were trained at Elstree, but most of them are over 40 and
there is nowhere for apprentices to learn. As for Mr Winner's claims, he
dismissed them as rubbish, pointing out that while he might shoot his
films on location, the crews he used had learned their skills in a
studio.
The High Court action is important for more than the film industry. It
is a test case which will be closely watched by other local authorities
to see whether Brent Walker is allowed to do what it wants with the site
in breach of the promises it gave in return for planning permission.
''There is no doubt Elstree is capable of becoming Britain's third
major studio,'' Mr Welsh said. ''With seven stages it could take
everything from commercials to big feature films.
''The town grew up around films and it's tragic we are being pulled
down by Brent Walker's problems. The last thing we need is a retail
park, which is what they want to sell it for.''
Brent Walker, for its part, argues that the studios are an albatross
-- nobody wants them and they are not viable. Murdoch thinks otherwise,
but his offer is only #1m, while Brent Walker believes the site is worth
10 times that.
There are films being made. Pinewood, still owned by its founder, the
Rank Organisation who created it in 1936, which has 18 stages, is
gearing up for the sequel to A Fish Called Wanda; Tom Cruise is making
Mission Impossible, having made Interview with the Vampire there;
Richard Gere did First Knight, a tale about King Arthur in which he is
Lancelot; and Gerry Anderson's puppets are starring in Space Precinct.
The studio apparently has bookings pencilled in for the next two years.
Shepperton, where Four Weddings and a Funeral was made in part, was
recently bought for #12m by the directors, Ridley and Tony Scott, and
they have ambitious plans for the 17-stage 26-acre complex. The new
Muppet movie, The Muppet Treasure Island, is being filmed there as well
as a lot of commercials. There is no shortage of work.
Mr Dorrell's pronouncement will be awaited with interest, although,
since he is unlikely to stay in the job long enough to implement
whatever he proposes, it may well be of an academic nature.

A YOUNG father was sentenced to three years detention yesterday for
''grotesquely cruel'' assaults on his baby daughter.
A jury convicted unanimously the Edinburgh man of two assaults on the
infant. To protect the child's identity, the man cannot be named.
Sheriff Andrew Lothian told the 19-year-old it was clear he should not
be anywhere near the baby ever again.
The sheriff said he would refer the matter to the Reporter to the
Children's Panel.
''I will say quite candidly that I will do everything in my power to
make sure that this child does not ever live with this person,'' he
said, adding: ''These were grotesquely cruel assaults on this baby.''
Sheriff Lothian had deferred sentence until yesterday for background
reports, following an earlier three-day trial at Edinburgh Sheriff
Court. A jury found the man guilty of assaulting the six-week-old baby
in June 1993, by pulling her arm to her severe injury.
He was also convicted of pulling and twisting the infant's leg to her
severe injury in September 1993, when she was four months old, and of
failing to get proper medical care for the girl after the second
assault.
The incidents took place in a high-rise flat where the man lived with
the baby's mother, and in another house nearby.
The jury was told that the baby's arm was broken in the first assault
and that she was left with a broken leg after the second.
The man denied the charges and, although he admitted that he was
sometimes rough when playing with the baby, said that any injuries were
accidental.
Sheriff Lothian imposed an 18-month supervised release order at the
end of the man's sentence, with a condition that he should not have any
contact with the child.

Neftegorsk, Thursday
RESCUE teams pulled six more survivors, one of them a three-month-old
girl, from the rubble of Neftegorsk today, four days after a violent
earthquake devastated this little town in Russia's Far East.
Authorities on the Pacific island of Sakhalin said chances of finding
anyone else alive were dwindling fast, with no-one likely to be able to
survive without water for more than another five days.
''We will continue to look for survivors for the next five days but
then the water runs out,'' Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu told
reporters as rescue teams recovered 30 corpses from the rubble today as
well as six people, three of them children, showing signs of life,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
At least 690 people are known to have died in the earthquake, the
emergencies ministry said.
A spokesman for the ministry -- which is in charge of the overall
rescue effort -- said authorities had accounted for 1094 people in the
town, 404 of whom were alive.
The spokesman, speaking by telephone, said he knew nothing about a
report on Itar-Tass news agency which quoted the government information
office as saying 1590 people had died.
A duty official at government headquarters declined to comment on the
Tass report.
Some of the latest bodies recovered were those of teenage students
crushed in a discotheque. Officials were heartened by the discovery of a
three-month-old baby who was still alive.
Rescuers worked around the clock amid the wreckage of multi-storey
buildings which collapsed like houses of cards when the tremor struck
the remote oil town early last Sunday.
Interfax news agency said Sakhalin's prosecutor had formally initiated
criminal proceedings in connection with the tragedy. It said he was
taking action under the criminal code which deals with infringement of
building regulations.
Angry survivors say the houses should never have been constructed in a
seismic zone.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
A TRAIN conductor was fired after passengers complained he was spying
on them through a peephole in the train's toilet.
Mr Mark Johnstone, 40, denied spying on passengers on a late Saturday
night train between Edinburgh and Bellshill. He claimed he was unfairly
sacked but a Glasgow industrial tribunal yesterday ruled the dismissal
was fair.
The tribunal heard that a young woman passenger telephoned and
complained she had seen the conductor open a control panel on a wall
that backed on to the toilet and was staring into it.
There was a hole on the same wall, inside the toilet. She claimed the
conductor followed her and her companions whenever they went to the
toilet, claiming he had been drinking.
An investigation revealed there was a hole in the toilet wall panel.
The woman and two of her friends said the conductor had been chatting
with them but whenever one of them went to the toilet, he followed. They
claimed they caught him stooping and looking into a cupboard behind the
toilet.
Mr Johnstone said he simply chatted to the women in question but
denied the ''spying'' allegation.
At his hearing, he admitted the cupboard door had been open and said
he had been attempting to close it when one of the women came upon him.
The tribunal said the evidence was that BR clearly had a genuine
belief of his misconduct and had reasonable grounds. It ruled that Mr
Johnstone, of Lethamhill Crescent, Riddrie, Glasgow, was not unfairly
sacked.

Medical Correspondent Alan MacDermid reports on implications of the
devastating injury to Superman star Christopher Reeve
AFTER a career acting out man's wildest fantasies, Superman star
Christopher Reeve will need all the courage he can summon to face the
life that lies ahead of him -- if he survives at all.
As his family gathered at his bedside last night the paralysed actor
hovered on the brink of death, his neck broken dangerously close to his
brain when he fell from his horse at the weekend.
He was on a respirator, unable to breathe for himself, and doctors
said it may be a year before they can consider spinal surgery.
The injuries he suffered -- described as complex fractures to the
first and second cervical vertebrae, with damage to his spinal cord --
leave him with the prospect of quadraplegia, a lifetime of complete
paralysis.
The site of the damage means that in terms of movement or sensation,
his brain is cut off from the body he worked so hard to keep fit for his
role in the Superman movies.
Doctors think it is only this fitness and strength which have enabled
him to survive at all this far, but a lifetime of constant immobility
and nursing is a sad fate for someone who fulfilled the role -- even in
celluloid fantasy -- which propelled Reeve to fame.
Dr Peter Edmond, director of the National Spinal Injury Unit at the
Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, said last night that once Reeve
had stabilised, the doctors' aim would be to reintegrate him with his
colleagues and society.
''One of the advantages of having a spinal injury centre is that you
bring people together with the same problem and this helps them to
adjust -- there is also the concentration of professional help.
''But he will need a lot of support from his friends, his family, and,
one hopes, from society at large. The psychological problems are one of
the main ones we have to overcome.
''Much will depend on his other interests. It will be such a contrast
for him, from the glamour of the film world, and the super-fit image he
portrayed, to the position of being so dependent on others. It is
difficult to imagine a greater contrast, and for him it will be a very
public one.''
The fact that Reeve required ventilation at this stage suggested he
would always need it, Dr Edmond said. But he could still be allowed home
and be mobile in a wheelchair.
''It is always our aim to get people home and give them the
best-possible quality of life, but for that you need round-the-clock
care. With such complete paralysis all body functions have to be taken
care of.
''The ventilation, which would be established before he left hospital,
would be with a device than can work from mains or battery, so it can be
carried on the back of a wheelchair,'' he said.
The air would be fed directly into his throat through a tracheostomy,
so that he didn't have an air pipe up to his mouth all the time. This
would enable him to eat and drink -- though he would have to be fed by
hand -- and he would be able to learn a new way of talking using the
exhalation of air through his throat.
With the possibility of some slight mobility above his neck, he could
learn to use a computer using micro-switches attached to the legs of
spectacles.
That means that the trademarks of Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent --
the tongue-in-cheek and the spectacles -- could be Reeve's link with the
outside world.
Ironically Reeve recently had a glimpse for himself of what lies
ahead. In an interview before his accident -- broadcast on US TV on
Wednesday -- he told how he had visited a spinal cord trauma unit to
prepare for a film role as a policeman hit in the spine by a bullet.
''A couple of days spent out at the spinal cord trauma unit and you
see how easily it can happen,'' he said. ''You think, God, it could
happen to anybody.''
The film was broadcast on Saturday, the day of the accident.
Up to 15 members of his family, including his divorced parents, his
wife and British ex-girlfriend, were maintaining a vigil as he continued
his fight for life.
A hospital spokeswoman said: ''They are fine people. Most of them have
been here since Sunday -- his father, his mother, his wife, his
children, his ex-girlfriend, several brothers and in-laws. It sure looks
like they are a close family and they are being very gracious at a
difficult time.''

DAMASCUS: President Hafez al-Assad said yesterday a framework
agreement between Syria and Israel on future security arrangements for
the Golan Heights was a step forward that needed to be implemented on
the ground. ''What was reached is a reference that would help achieve
progress, if there is any progress. It is a step which needs other
efforts to implement it on the ground,'' Assad said.
Speaking to reporters after nearly six hours of talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Assad also said Syria would never accept
anything less than Israel's full withdrawal to the pre-war June 4, 1967,
border Lines. He also said there was no need at present to upgrade the
level of peace talks with Israel, held at ambassadorial level.
Honda scandal
CONCORD: Two former executives of American Honda Motor Co. were found
guilty yesterday of accepting more than $15m in kickbacks from Honda
dealers in a nationwide bribery scheme. A federal jury in Concord, New
Hampshire, took seven days to reach a verdict to convict the former
executives. They are Dennis Josleyn, 48, Honda's former West Coast sales
manager, and John Billmyer, 65, a former senior vice president. They are
to be sentenced in August.
Appeal fails
PARIS: France's supreme court rejected yesterday an appeal by Nazi
collaborator Paul Touvier against a life prison sentence for crimes
against humanity. Touvier, 80, had appealed for a re-trial on legal
technicalities. A court jailed him for life in April last year over the
1944 execution of seven Jews at Rillieux-la-Pape, near Lyon, when he was
intelligence chief of the Lyon militia during the Second World War.
Victims fund
VIENNA: Austria's parliament yesterday voted in favour of setting up a
compensation fund for an estimated 30,000 victims of Nazi rule, all of
them living abroad. Deputies from most of Austria's political parties,
including the far right, backed a government bill to establish the 500
million schilling ($50m) fund but the leftist Greens voted against,
arguing that the cash offered was not enough.
Chechen attacks
MOSCOW: Russian aircraft and gunners renewed attacks on rebel
positions in breakaway Chechnya yesterday and troops were reported to be
advancing on separatist bases in the southern mountains. Itar-Tass news
agency said warplanes were sent into action and shelling had resumed in
the south and southeast of Chechnya.
Flood alert
OSLO: The Norwegian government yesterday set up a crisis group to help
combat the worst floods to hit the country for 125 years. Melting snow
and heavy rains have flooded rivers, cutting off roads, covering
farmland and isolating sparsely populated districts in southeastern
Norway north of Oslo.
Corvette deal
CAPE TOWN: South African President Nelson Mandela put plans to buy
four warships from Britain or Spain on hold yesterday, saying his
government would examine afresh whether they were needed. He told the
Senate there was significant popular opposition to the 1.6 billion rand
($444m) plan to buy four corvettes.

FULL-time students may have to contribute more to help fund their
education, and the best way would be for them to repay the cost, at a
rate dictated by their income, when they start work, a conference in
Aberdeen heard yesterday.
Professor Lee Harvey, co-author of a recent report on students'
attitudes to funding higher education, told the conference at The Robert
Gordon University: ''If additional money is to be raised to expand
higher education and to address current funding iniquities, such as the
arrangements for part-time students, then full-time students may have to
contribute more.
''Government funding could then be shared more equally among all
students.''
Professor Harvey, of the Centre for Research into Quality at the
University of Central England in Birmingham, said the majority of 1139
students surveyed were in debt.
The largest creditor was the Student Loans Company and more than half
of the students considered their living standards to be ''difficult''.
Although 73.1% were in debt, more than half described themselves as
being in credit, reflecting a change in their perception of
indebtedness.
The majority believed their financial circumstances were adversely
affecting their academic performance.
More than 92% believed the system was in need of reform, 71.9%
considered all the tuition costs should be met by the Government, but
only 41.9% considered the Government should be responsible for fully
funding student maintenance and 44% felt there should be some form of
student or graduate contribution.
Professor Harvey told the conference that they had evaluated six
reports on approaches to funding -- from a lifetime standard
contribution through a graduate tax to means-testing the student loans
scheme.
He said the present system was antiquated and most of the proposals
involved tinkering with it. ''It is an elite system for a mass audience.
We are coming through mass to universal and we need a funding system
that reflects that.''
The research suggested that education should remain free at the point
of entry and that funding should facilitate lifelong learning and not
the traditional three-year full-time degree. The administration of
funding should be made more efficient and more accountable.
Distance learners and part-time students should have the same rights
of access to funding as full-time students and students should
contribute towards the cost of their education as part of a
retrospective, income-dependent contribution scheme.
He said proposals for a graduate tax had been admired for their
simplicity but failed to match individuals' repayments with their
education costs, which meant someone completing a two-year HND would pay
the same as someone who graduated after five years with a degree in
medicine.
He also rejected a CBI suggestion of means-testing student loans, to
target them more efficiently, because the proposal relied on continued
financial support from families when statistics showed many did not
receive parental contributions.
Top-up fees for particularly expensive or popular courses had been
suggested but Professor Harvey said this could lead to a multi-tiered
system and add to student hardship.

THE needs of young people leaving care are not being met adequately,
which results in many becoming homeless, the director of Barnardo's
Scotland told a national conference in Edinburgh yesterday.
New Government legislation on child care did not offer an adequate
solution to the problem.
Mr Hugh Mackintosh said a significant number of young people
experienced frequent moves when they were in care -- foster home
breakdowns, residential care, back home, and then another attempt at a
foster home.
''One young person attending a Barnardo's leaving care project, by the
age of 17, had experienced 21 moves and 11 different schools. In such
cases, it is extremely difficult for those young people to settle down
when the time comes to leave care.''
Mr Mackintosh said only a small number of 15 to 17-year-olds were
allocated a place in a supported scheme or their own tenancy.
''Very often, young people are not given a choice of accomodation and
do not feel involved in deciding where they are to live,'' he told the
conference.
The Barnardo's director said the planning and provision of leaving
care services must be seen within the context of a published,
comprehensive, and cohesive plan, which addressed the needs of young
children through to teenagers and independent young adults.
Statutory and independent agencies must work together to produce a
range of resources which reflected the needs of today's young people in,
and leaving, care.
He said the Children's Scotland Bill, currently going through
Parliament, did not go far enough in extending the duties of council
social work departments towards young people leaving care.

When The Cat Laughs we all laugh:
Keelin Shanley sets the scene for
an Irish festival where the top
stand-ups are getting a chance to
warm up for the Edinburgh Fringe
RICHARD Cook's philosophy that you enjoy the view whether you're going
up or down will stand him in good stead this weekend. The principle
organiser of The Cat Laughs, a new comedy festival being launched in
Kilkenny, says: ''Of course I'm nervous; it's a huge undertaking, but
overall I'm more excited.''
The festival is offering more than 30 acts that combine the best from
America, the UK, and Ireland. George Wendt, better known as Norm from
Cheers, and his improvisational company, The Second City, are hosting
the festival and are performing each night. In August, they come to the
Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where they are expected to waltz off with the
stand-up comedy awards. Among others tuning up fpr Edinburgh are Jo
Brand, Emo Philips, Jeremy Hardy, Sean Hughes, and Donna McPhail.
The Cat Laughs contrasts strongly with the Montreal and Edinburgh
festivals in that the venues are all quite intimate, the largest seating
only 300 and the smallest just 90. It is being held in Kilkenny, a small
city about two hours from Dublin, and will take over the entire city for
the weekend with all performances within walking distance.
A decision has been made to keep the whole thing relaxed and TV
cameras have been banned from the shows. In order to take the pressure
off performers there are no awards or competitions and artistic control
rests entirely with directors. Says Cook: ''There won't be any managers
block-booking slots, if you don't like the acts you have only me to
blame and you can find me in the festival office.''
Cook has a background in theatre and runs the Bickerstaff Theatre
Company in Kilkenny. He says that there was never a point where he
decided that Ireland was ready for a festival of this size, it was more
instinct. But looking around the country there is great evidence of an
upsurge in stand-up comedy with venues opening up in most of the larger
towns and cities.
''Stand-up comedy has taken off in the past five years. In the US the
tradition is about 35 years old, in the UK it's about 15 years old, in
Ireland it's much younger -- but it's definitely beginning to move from
the realm of alternative to mainstream and it's a highly skilled art
form.''
Ireland has produced a disproportionately large number of successful
comedians in the past few years. Ardal O'Hanlon won the 1993 Hackney
Empire comedy award with another Irish comedian, Kevin Gildea, coming
third. Ardal is now starring in the Channel 4 series Father Ted, while
Kevin is touring Britain with great success. Other Irish comedians
playing the UK circuit are Dylan Moran, who won Edinburgh's So You Think
You're Funny award, Derot Carmody and, of course, Sean Hughes.
However, there is a problem for the Irish circuit in that as soon as
comedians find success they go to London. There is not enough money in
Irish comedy to support them there. As the talent leaves a new batch
comes up, but without the guidance or example of seasoned professionals
to follow.
According to Gildea the need to leave Ireland isn't only financial. He
believes that you get taken seriously only when you prove that you can
succeed abroad. And this isn't just a recent phenomenon. Tony Kenny, an
Irish comedian from the thirties, is quoted as saying that ''you could
go to London, play a toilet, and fill a theatre in Dublin when you got
back''.
Cook believes it is inevitable that Irish comedians go to the UK.
''Britain has a well-developed circuit but I do hope that this festival
might provide them with an opportunity to come back and play more Irish
venues.''
The success of the Irish abroad might indicate a particular ''Irish''
style of comedy, but this is denied. However some differences between
Irish comedy and British or American comedy are acknowledged. Cook
believes Irish comedy is more observational and impressionist; there
isn't much hard-hitting political satire, possibly because Ireland is so
small.
One of the most interesting facets of The Cat Laughs for Cook is
seeing the audience reaction to the different comedy forms that this
festival is offering. However an Irish audience is a little daunting for
some acts. George Wendt says that his improvisation act with Second City
will have to be changed slightly as much of the American political
satire will have to be left out. While he'd love to replace it with
Irish politics, he doesn't think he's quite up to it. He also has a few
worries about language, but with five shows over the weekend what works
and what doesn't should become clear fairly quickly.
The international line-up has been achieved by finding co-directors in
Britain and America. It is being run in conjunction with Michael
McCarthy from Los Angeles, Noel Faulkner of the London Comedy Cafe, and
Peter Grahame from the King's Head Club in London.
McCarthy is responsible for the American contingent in Kilkenny. He
says that The Cat Laughs is happening because of a Why Not? attitude.
Once the initial decision to run the festival was taken he was sent to
Montreal to find the best of American and also to ''surreptitiously take
copious notes on how a festival is run''.
The festival has been positioned between the Montreal and Edinburgh
events and the aim is to offer the best of both. Providing all goes well
this should be the start of an annual event but Cook isn't worrying
about the long-term future now; all he wants is for booking to stay as
strong as it has been and for everything to happen as it's listed in the
brochure.

SCOTTISH Homes yesterday announced plans to dispose of all its houses
in Stirling, Falkirk, and Clackmannan -- more than 3000 -- to other
landlords.
As in the case of previous large-scale transfers by the housing
agency, the plans are already controversial.
Falkirk District Council, angry at the refusal by Scottish Homes to
allow local authorities to bid for the properties, recently conducted a
postal survey of tenants in the agency's 1650 Falkirk properties.
It produced 98% support from those polled for the district council as
their future landlord.
Councillor James Short, convener of the Housing Services Committee,
said he was very concerned about the future of Scottish Homes tenants in
Falkirk.
They faced being transferred to housing associations or private
landlords, with no guarantees of security of tenure, rent levels, right
to buy, or standard of service.
Mr Pat Plunkett, Scottish Homes initiatives manager, said tenants in
the region would be actively involved in the transfer of their homes and
would be consulted at all key stages before secret ballots were held.
''Scottish Homes will only proceed with the transfer if a majority of
tenants are in favour of the change,'' said Mr Plunkett.
In Falkirk, Stirling, and Clackmannan, among those indicating an
interest in the houses is Central Housing, a partnership of tenants and
Scottish Homes management staff.

I'VE just seen a girl called Maria, and suddenly that name will never
be the same . . . a 1995 Olivier winner, Maria Friedman has revised and
expanded the one-woman show, originally at the Donmar, that won her the
award. Now, after a try out on the Isle of Mull, the show has happily
surfaced at the Whitehall Theatre in London.
Maria Friedman -- by Extra Special Arrangement is an out-and-out
triumph. She is backed by a superb 11-piece orchestra under Michael
Haslam and sings a selection of songs that are touching, exciting, and
emotionally nourishing. These include a chilling song written in a
ghetto by a doomed 12-year-old boy and popular standards by Lennon and
McCartney and Kate Bush.
There's a whole raft of excellent songs from the French, by composers
of the stature of Jacques Brel, Michel Legrand and Leo Ferre, many of
which are sung in adroit translations by the show's director, Jeremy
Sams. Well-chosen show songs include three wonderful examples by
Sondheim; the singer has appeared with distinction in three of his
shows. All the songs have special arrangements, commissioned from the
best in the business -- and it shows.
Maria Friedman is a terrific performer with a huge and versatile
talent honed to perfection on stage and TV. She has a beautiful voice
that is as at home in full-out belters as in soft and moving ballads. In
two hours she sings over two dozen songs: each comes up fresh as if
newly minted.

GLASGOW'S accommodation of the RSAMD is a vital link in the
educational and cultural life of the city but, sadly, the music
department of Glasgow University often has to rest in the shadow of her
sister establishment. Last night a concert was given at the university
by student performers, and spotlighting student composers.
Stewart McMurdo's Symphonic Movement for Orchestra reveals a die-hard
late romanticist. Although influences of Mahler and Bruckner saturate
the score, his music still manages to say something new in bold
development of the principal motifs and startling contrasts in texture
and dynamic. Impressive throughout the sections, McMurdo has clearly
digested his orchestration. A performance of the projected symphony must
follow.
Tommy Fowler is a name not unfamiliar on the Glasgow scene, having had
pieces performed by the SCO and Cappella Nova. Last night he unveiled
his Concerto for Cor Anglais and Orchestra, dedicated to and performed
by Hamish Whittle. Constructed in three contrasting movements, these are
linked by traces of the Scots ballad Binorie which serves as the basic
building block of the piece.
Fowler's orchestration is structurally secure but the piece was
slightly flawed in the balance with the soloist. Whittle's cor anglais
tone is a rich one when allowed to be heard and at times this just
wasn't possible. That said, Fowler's technique is clever and
incorporates many different idioms which perhaps cannot quite be
digested on one hearing -- roll on another performance.
Fowler's Sonatina for Violin and Piano was the first-half highlight,
violinist Alison Dixon delivering an exquisite translation of this
evocative miniature. Allan Wylie's Big Empty Rooms and Michael Spencer's
Symbiont suggest that Glasgow University is nurturing a future
generation of contemporary composers.

A WOMAN who alleges that she was the victim of a gang rape failed
yesterday in her attempt to bring what would have been only the third
private prosecution in Scotland this century.
Three High Court judges ruled that the 25-year-old woman had failed to
establish the very special circumstances required under Scots law to
justify a private prosecution.
The woman claimed that she was attacked in her home in Dunfermline in
September 1992 by Mr Alistair Forsyth, 24, Mr Graeme Naismith, 24, and
Mr Christopher Blount, 22, all from Dunfermline.
They claimed the woman had consented to sex and the case was set down
for trial at the High Court in Kirkcaldy in September 1993. However,
because of a mistake by police in England, a vital Crown witness failed
to turn up.
The Crown asked Lord Clyde for an extension of the 12-month time limit
within which cases on indictment must be brought. This was refused and
the case collapsed.
The woman brought a Bill for Criminal Letters, the method of applying
for a private prosecution in Scotland.
Normally, criminal proceedings in Scotland are brought by the Crown
under the direction of the Lord Advocate and private prosecutions have
to be sanctioned by the High Court.
In this case, the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, told the
High Court at Edinburgh that he would not oppose the private prosecution
if the court thought it was competent.
Yesterday, Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, who heard arguments in
the case with Lords Marnoch and Brand, said counsel for the three men
had argued that a private prosecution would be incompetent.
That was because the 12-month period within which an accused must be
brought to trial after a first court appearance applied to a private
prosecution.
Lord Ross disagreed. He said the court was satisfied that the Criminal
Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, which governed the situation, applied
only to public prosecutions.
However, there also had to be special circumstances to justify a
private prosecution.
Mr Andrew Hardie QC, Dean of the Faculty, appearing for the woman,
argued that special circumstances did exist in this case.
When the original case was called and the judge refused to extend the
12-month period, the Crown had dropped the case and not appealed against
the decision.
Mr Hardie also argued that the Crown should not have waited until the
12-month period had almost expired before trying to get the trial under
way.
He added that the nature of the crime, a rape alleged to have been
committed by three accused, was in itself a special circumstance.
However, Lord Ross said: ''It is well recognised that private
prosecution is allowed only in exceptional cases. . . but I find it
difficult to see what other special circumstances can be said to be
present.''
The circumstances here were not as strong as those which existed 14
years ago when Carole X brought a private prosecution in the GLasgow
rape case in 1982, after she was raped and slashed with a razor in a
Portakabin in the East End of Glasgow. The case ended with one of her
attackers being jailed for 12 years after a trial at the High Court in
Edinburgh.
The only other private prosecution this century which got off the
ground was in a fraud case involving the shipment of coal.

Rob Adams explains how one good turn deserved another for a musician
who is still struttin' his stuff
IN the mid-1970s Roger Ball and his Average White Band colleagues
introduced their old friend, Glaswegian guitarist Jim Mullen, to their
record company, the mighty Atlantic Records, beginning a successful
decade for Mullen and his saxophone-playing partner Dick Morrissey.
Now Mullen has reciprocated by introducing Ball to his current label,
the small but selective EFZ, which has just released the AWB
saxophonist's first solo album, Street Struttin'.
The quantum leap from Atlantic's Manhattan HQ to EFZ's base in Slough
presents no problems for Ball, who remembers only too well making a
similar leap in the opposite direction. With boyish enthusiasm he
recalls the sessions for AWB's second album, the ''White'' one, which
topped the American charts and spawned AWB's anthem, Ball's composition
Pick Up the Pieces.
In a Florida studio Atlantic Records legends Tom Dowd, Arif Mardin and
Jerry Wexler were producing Aretha Franklin and her band. ''Everyone in
that studio was a god to us,'' says Ball, ''and after they finished we
walked in, six blokes from Scotland. We were shittin' our breeks.''
Their success was marred by the death, following a celebration party,
of Robbie McIntosh whose fabulous drumming, a kind of pipe-band snare
technique meets Stax, was right at the heart of AWB's sound and whose
perfectionism and passion for the music was crucial to their
achievements.
AWB were never quite the same again, although they remained successful
into the early 1980s. Received wisdom back home said they were all
millionaires. Ball differs. ''We had a few good years, a couple of major
records, but we didn't hit the big-time that big. Plus with a band
there's a lot of mouths to feed and it doesn't sustain you forever.''
When AWB split -- guitarist Hamish Stuart to work with Paul McCartney,
drummer Steve Ferrone with everyone from Duran Duran to Pat Metheny,
saxophonist Molly Duncan with Curiosity Killed the Cat -- Ball fell back
on the architecture degree he had gained in Dundee before leaving for
London in 1970.
''I needed the money. I thought there'd be money from our publishing
but there wasn't and I had a couple of years that were just nasty. I
didn't want to live in New York which you have to if you want to play
sessions, so I stayed in Connecticut and worked as an architect for five
years. I did some interesting stuff, actually, but I slowly drifted back
into music.''
In 1988 three original members -- Ball, bassist Alan Gorrie and
guitarist Onnie MacIntyre reformed AWB. They work ''often enough'',
leaving time for other things such as writing songs with Daryl Hall, in
Gorrie's case, and solo albums.
''I'd tried doing my own album a few times and never found the
direction I wanted to go in,'' says Ball. ''Then, when I got back into
music it had changed a lot in terms of technology. Everyone was writing
with sequencers, so I got into that and it really helped with getting
ideas down.''
Street Struttin' is a set of mostly crisp jazz/funk tunes, the spirit
of Pick Up the Pieces transposed into the 90s, with romantic nods
towards Motown and Duke Ellington. It sounds good. But Ball has no plans
to form his own band and hit the clubs -- yet.
''Maybe after another album or two I will, but it's so expensive to
tour and such hard work,'' says the man who is about to leave for the
Caribbean with AWB to record a TV special. ''We'll be there for a week
and we have to play for 45.'' The wee souls.

TWO plumbers who admitted overcharging people by thousands of pounds
for drainage work had sentence deferred at Edinburgh Sheriff Court
yesterday.
Michael Campbell, 40, and Ricky Venters, 34, who worked together as
Prompt Drainage, admitted six charges between them.
Campbell, of Oxgangs Crescent, Edinburgh, admitted getting #570 by
fraud from 65-year-old Samuel Calderwood, getting #7050 by fraud from
Stanley Robertson, 58, and getting #2000 by fraud from the Rev Hugh
MacKay, 64.
Campbell also admitted telling police that a #17,000 TV probe used for
checking drains had been stolen in a break-in at his home, when it had
not.
Venters, of Caledonian Road, Edinburgh, admitted trying to get #2770
from a couple by fraud, and getting #1000 by fraud from 87-year-old
Malcolm Aitken.
The offences all took place in Edinburgh between March and December
1993.
Depute-fiscal Liz Cameron told Sheriff Iain Macphail the firm was
contacted, through Yellow Pages or newspaper advertisements, by people
with plumbing problems.
On one occasion, Campbell and other workers dug trenches exposing
pipes in a back garden. Campbell then produced an estimate of #9750, and
asked for #570 payment for work that had already been done.
Someone from another firm, called in by an insurance company assessor,
cured the original problem in 20 minutes for #65 plus VAT.
Sheriff Macphail deferred sentence for background reports until June
21.

David Belcher talks to Indy producers On-U Sounds in Walthamstow, home
of British reggae
AN inner-city hawk swoops suddenly across the deserted car park
adjoining a half-let office complex in the half-shut burgh of
Walthamstow. Homing in on its prey, the bird vanishes into the
undergrowth which straggles along a nearby railway embankment.
''Pigeons,'' says Pete Holdsworth, gazing idly out of one of the
complex's windows. Bobby Marshall nods his head.
Nodding my own head, I wonder if there's an analogy to be drawn from
the whole scenario . . . Walthamstow: home to the hunter and the hunted
. . . where nature will run its true course. Possibly. But why am I in
Walthamstow, trying to make sense of the place? Because Walthamstow has
recently assumed a more prominent role in British popular culture.
Musically, this apparently-undistinguished suburban east London
borough is most famous as the home of screamybop idols East 17.
Walthamstow moreover was the title of their second album. But what is of
more crucial note to informed reggae-lovers is the fact that Walthamstow
is the current location of the On-U Sounds empire, which this year
celebrates its 15th anniversary.
On-U Sounds, the label, was founded in 1980 by Adrian Sherwood. It
reached what has been the peak of its chart fame to date in 1991 with
the top 10 success of Human Nature by Gary Clail. What On-U Sounds has
always been most successful at, however, is mixing things up in a
positive cross-cultural sense.
On-U Sounds' steady development is rooted, for example, in the love of
a bunch of white boys for the black musical form, reggae, around which
they grew up. Furthermore, for the past decade On-U Sounds has been home
to the cream of New York's rhythm-makers: Skip MacDonald, Keith LeBlanc
and Doug Wimbish, all of whom can presently be found floating in and out
of On-U Sounds' Walthamstow warren of studios and offices.
Not that On-U Sounds waste their money on international jet-set
flummery. Among their co-tenants at the Alpha Business Centre is the
local Job Club.
So what jobs do Bobby Marshall and Pete Holdsworth do within the On-U
Sounds set-up? Bobby's On-U duties have been many and varied, revolving
around his friendship with On-Sounds' leading light Mark Stewart, the
man who inadvertently sparked a slow-burning Bristolian fuse when he
assembled the Pop Group.
A long-time mate of Adrian Sherwood, Pete was in there from the start.
His only lengthy absence from the On-U fold was for a period spent at
film school. Pete was in fact once the singer in an On-U Sounds band,
London Underground. ''I got that out of my system, thankfully . . . too
many people linger in the performing arena without getting any better at
it,'' he says. ''This is not a good industry in which to be seen as a
plodder.''
At the moment the duo are thrustfully overseeing On-U Sounds'
involvement in one of British record-retailing's major growth-areas: the
re-issuing of vintage dub albums. As the masterminds of the Pressure
Sounds imprint, Bobby and Pete have so far released three albums.
First up was Santic And Friends, a compilation of the work of producer
Leonard Chin featuring artists such as Horace Andy, Gregory Isaacs, and
Augustus Pablo. Dub to Africa is a 1979 album by the late Prince Far-I,
backed by the Roots Radics, and The Same Song by Israel Vibration dates
from 1978.
These three albums have helped swell the dub sections in all informed
record stores. After years of neglect, the dub genre has become a
fashionable one.
Horace Andy, most recently seen and heard in action with Massive
Attack, has just had his 18-year-old album, In The Light, re-released in
a special dub version by vintage reggae specialist label Blood And Fire.
The same label has just issued LPs by Rico (Roots To The Bone) and
Augustus Pablo (Classic Rockers), while Pressure Sounds' re-issue plans
include albums by Keith Hudson and Lee Perry.
But why, in an era characterised by ever-increasing rates of
beats-per-minute, all the interest in glacially-slow dub sounds?
''This niche has emerged because now, more than ever before, people
are interested in the sound of records, and dub was the first completely
studio-oriented music,'' says Pete.
''I think we're in an interesting, eclectic period of music at the
moment, but it's not one that's based on great songs or great
songwriters . . . it's about experimenting in studios, which is
something reggae has always done.
''And that notion of open-mindedness always been the biggest part of
what On-U Sounds is about. That and the idea that music can change
things . . . that music can be more than what I call neck music.''
Neck music?
''Yeah. Some music just makes you stand there with a stiff neck, your
chin jutting forward and your jaws clamped shut. You sway a bit from
side to side and look confrontational. In contrast, when you hear dub,
you feel loosened and uplifted.''
And in Walthamstow, I can report that the hawk does not always wreak
havoc among the pigeons. A good omen, that, both for On-U Sounds' next
15 years and for the music the On-U bods champion.

ANIMAL cruelty officers who raided a piggery operated by Scotland's
largest pig breeder told a court yesterday that conditions at the unit
were ''atrocious''.
Inspectors from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals said they found some pigs paralysed and in ''filthy''
conditions.
Arthur Simmers Ltd, of Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, faces three charges
of causing unnecessary suffering to animals at its Muir of Pert piggery,
Tealing, near Dundee, last year, between February 20 and 24, and on
March 3 and August 4.
The charges concern 17 pigs. Dundee Sheriff Court earlier heard that
six of the animals had to be destroyed.
The firm denies the charges and also that between February 20 and 24
last year it left pig carcasses unburied in a place where dogs could get
access.
Inspector William Wilson, of the SSPCA, told the court that three
paralysed pigs were found in ''filthy'' conditions during a raid on
February 24 last year.
He said there were several other pigs in the pen, adding that the
paralysed pigs should have been isolated to save them from being
trampled.
Another pig, which was affected by growths, was discovered in a pen
which Inspector Wilson claimed was ''just filthy. It was just dung.''
The inspector described the stockmanship as non-existent.
SSPCA Inspector Michael Flynn said health conditions in one of the
buildings were ''absolutely atrocious. There's acceptable dirt and
unacceptable dirt. This particular building looked like it hadn't been
cleaned in months.'' He said there was ''ingrained filth around the
walls''.
He told the court it was ''a disgrace'' to call the piggery a minimal
disease unit.
However, cross-examined by Mr Kevin Drummond QC, for Arthur Simmers
Ltd, the inspector admitted vets who had visited the premises on several
occasions before the raid knew more about minimal disease units than he
did.
The trial was adjourned until a later date.

A MAN found stabbed to death in a flat in the Czech Republic last
month, was a computer expert from Edinburgh, it was revealed yesterday.
Mr David Senior, 39, from Edinburgh, was murdered in his Prague flat
between April 24 and 29, but his body lay undiscovered until May 5, just
days before he was due to return to Scotland.
It is thought Mr Senior, who stood as Liberal Democrat candidate for
North East Fife at the last General Election, disturbed a burglar as he
returned to his rented home after a night out.
A freelance consultant, Mr Senior -- a former arts editor of Gay
Scotland -- had been working in Prague for a year and was set to return
to his flat in the capital's Montgomery Street.
His death has confirmed fears over the safety of foreigners in the
capital of the republic, which has become a popular destination for
Westerners since the fall of Communism.
A tourist from Lothian was stabbed there a few months ago, and already
this year at least four foreigners are known to have been killed.
Raised in Northern Ireland, Mr Senior lived in Edinburgh for many
years. He wrote for many gay magazines and, last night, close friend and
editor of the ScotsGay magazine, Mr John Hein, said David had finished
his work but was spending some time there on holiday.
Mr Hein, from Edinburgh, said: ''It's a tragedy because he was due to
return home very shortly. He had been working with the Czech Savings
Bank.
''His family, who live in Northern Ireland, are absolutely
devastated.''

SCOTLAND's newest arts venue, the Edinburgh Festival Theatre, is to be
the subject of an #8000 study into its economic impact on the city's
economy.
It will be funded jointly by Edinburgh District Council and Lothian
and Edinburgh Enterprise company, LEEL.
Despite having spent #15m in developing the theatre, Edinburgh
District Council yesterday defended the decision to appoint independent
consultants to undertake the project.
Convener of the council's economic development and estates committee,
Councillor Sheila Kennedy, said: ''With the theatre having been open
almost a year, we now need to measure precisely its impact.''
The theatre is thought to have come close to bankruptcy, amid disputes
over the funding of the theatre trust.
Last month, the district council decided to inject #1m into a rescue
package designed to reduce the theatre's #3.1m deficit.
It stressed, however, that its contribution could go ahead only if
Lothian Regional Council or the enterprise company matched the figure.
The region has yet to make a decision.
A district council spokesman said: ''The reason for the economic
impact survey is to try to find out if the resource is being used
properly.''
A LEEL spokesperson added: ''We will be interested to examine not only
the jobs created within the theatre but the advantages of attracting
tourists and the setting up of, for example, restaurants in the area.''

<HEADLINE>No sleepers on 'replacement' direct run. An empty train is a service, BR maintains</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978092265</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Rail will consider restoring a direct service between Fort
William and London if three appeal judges uphold a ban on ''ghost''
trains in Strathclyde.
However, the service would be an ordinary train, not a sleeper, and
passengers travelling north to Fort William would have to disembark at
Edinburgh in the middle of the night.
The possibility emerged yesterday as BR's favoured option should it
fail in its appeal against last month's decision in the Court of Session
which halted the immediate ending of the sleeper service.
BR announced that it wished to save #2.5m by closing the loss-making
West Highland sleeper service from May 28.
It said it would introduce substitute services on three short
stretches of line in Strathclyde currently used only by the sleeper -- a
23.58 train from Maryhill to Bishopbriggs, a 23.48 from Cumbernauld to
Glasgow, and a diversion of the 20.05 Inverness to Glasgow service via
Cumbernauld.
BR argued that, by this means, it was maintaining a passenger service
on the line and there was therefore no need to go through lengthy public
consultation procedures laid down by the 1993 Railways Act for when a
passenger service was being withdrawn.
Highland region went to the Court of Session, claiming the substitute
services were a sham to get round the consultation process.
Last month, Lord Kirkwood ruled that a railway passenger service
within the meaning of the 1993 Act must be a genuine service which was
intended for the carriage of passengers.
He added: ''It seems to me that a late-night service for which there
is not shown to be any need, which is unlikely to be of any benefit to
the travelling public and may well not carry any passengers at all, and
is introduced simply for the purpose of seeking to prevent the closure
procedure coming into operation, cannot properly be regarded as a
railway passenger service within the meaning of the Act.''
The judge banned BR from withdrawing the existing sleeper service
until consultation procedures are completed.
Yesterday, Mr Christopher Haddow, QC, counsel for BR, asked Lord
President Hope, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and Osborne, to rule that
Lord Kirkwood had misinterpreted the 1993 Act.
Mr Haddow argued that the substitute services on three stretches of
line in Strathclyde were passenger services and the decision to withdraw
the Fort William sleeper did not amount to a closure under the 1993 Act.
He said the easiest way was to look at the timetable and see whether a
service was available for passengers. ''A train can be empty, as they
quite often are, and still be a passenger service,'' he maintained.
Lord Hope said the question arose as to whether there was really a
service if the trains were of no practical value.
Mr Haddow replied that people knew the termini and the times of the
services. The trains were staffed and available for the carriage of
passengers.
Mr Haddow told the court that BR had been forced to consider what to
do if Lord Kirkwood's decision was upheld.
Consideration had been given to various possibilities in relation to
Fort William and the most likely would be a non-sleeper service to and
from Fort William which would connect at Edinburgh with the Inverness
and Aberdeen sleeper.
The service would arrive in Edinburgh about midnight on the way down
from Fort William and about 4am on the way up from London.
''That is the most favoured possibility of providing a direct link
from Fort William to London,'' added Mr Haddow.
Mr Andrew Hajducki, QC, for Highland region, submitted that Lord
Kirwood had three reasons for deciding that the ''ghost'' trains were
not passenger services.
They were a latenight service for which there was no need, they were
unlikely to benefit the travelling public, and they had been introduced
simply to get round the closure procedures.
He added: ''(People) . . . have a proper right to be consulted, which
is not to be defeated merely be a device of introducing a ghost train in
a sham service. That must have been the intention of Parliament -- to
provide genuine consultation.''
Lord Hope said the court hoped to issue a decision next week and there
remains a strong possibility that the case will end up in the House of
Lords.

ALLAN LAING on The Archers' visit
to Ayrshire
THE BBC's initial intention sounded decidedly boring -- let's produce
a propaganda radio programme, they said, designed to promote new farming
methods for the post-war era. But along the way it developed into ''an
everyday story of country folk'' and, in the process, became Britain's
first soap opera at a time when soap was something you washed your hands
with. Today, three generations later, The Archers is required listening
for thousands of people, many of whom wouldn't be caught dead watching
EastEnders.
So popular is Radio Four's daily serial that there is expected to be
standing-room only at Irvine's Magnum Centre next Saturday when Eddie
Grundy, Elizabeth Pargetter, and Caroline Bone take to the stage to tell
fans everything they always wanted to know about The Archers.
Ambridge finally comes to Ayrshire with this rare Scottish appearance
by the actors who play the aforementioned characters (Trevor Harrison,
Alison Darling, and Sara Coward).
To put you in the picture, radio-wise, tenant farmer Eddie Grundy is a
bit of a ne'er-do-well who's into shady dealings. But he's a likeable
rogue none the less. Elizabeth Pargetter is a flightly piece (she used
to be a reporter on the Birmingham Mail) who's married to the local
squire and between them they run their stately home as a conference
centre.
Elizabeth Bone, who was going to get married to the local vicar but
called it off at the last minute, is now the manager of the Gray Gables
Hotel and has fallen in love with the owner of the estate (who's a lot
older than her, by the way).
Current racy topics of conversation in Ambridge, the talk of the
village steamie as it were, include racism (Asian lawyer Usha Gupta, a
recent arrival, has been mugged, her home's been burglarised, and
someone has thrown ammonia in her face), drugs (young Kate Aldridge who
ran away from home has returned to the village with a substance-abuse
habit), and bankruptcy (the Snells' computer company has just gone
pear-shaped).
An Evening With The Archers is part of a promotional road show for the
national radio station. The event starts on Friday at Kilmarnock Academy
where a special edition of the educational programme, The Sound of
Science, will be recorded before an audience of 11 to 14-year-olds.
Presenter Alun Lewis will not only construct a microphone from a piece
of tinfoil and a magnet, he will also reveal the secrets behind special
radio sound effects.
Later the same evening at Kilmarnock College Jonathan Dimbleby will
host a Scottish edition of Any Questions. The panel will include
Scottish Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst, Labour MP Peter Mandelson, SNP
Parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing, and Professor Sheila McLean,
International Bar Association professor of Law and Ethics in Medicine at
Glasgow University. Tickets for the programme are available from the
college and the local tourist information centre.
The Radio Four Ayrshire weekend ends on Sunday evening with a
recording of the popular comedy quiz show, Just A Minute, with host
Nicholas Parsons. The panel will consist of Derek Nimmo, Peter Jones,
Tony Hawks, and Scots comedian Fred McAuley.

<HEADLINE>Warning of more trouble as Spanish trawler cuts Cornish nets</HEADLINE>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>978092274</RECORDNO>

A SPANISH trawler ignored repeated warnings and deliberately cut
through the nets of a Cornish fishing boat, its skipper said yesterday.
Mr Mike Faulkner, arriving at Newlyn harbour to unload his catch from
the Golden Bells II, said the Spanish vessel dragged through a 1000-yard
section of fine mesh netting worth #1000.
The incident, 100 miles off Land's End, followed a confrontation with
the 54ft Cornish fishing boat, which steered alongside the larger
vessel.
The Golden Bells II tried to force the Spaniards clear of its eight
miles of gill netting, which were anchored to the seabed.
''Several of my crew speak Spanish,'' Mr Faulkner said. ''I was
speaking to the Spanish skipper on the radio and the crew were shouting
across to him. But he was ignoring all of us.
''He only had to move 300 yards or so north or south of us to be
clear. But he was not interested and he just kept pressing on.
''The only way we could try to stop him was to remain within 20ft of
him, hoping to force him away.
''But if I had not moved he would have hit me. He managed to cut our
net and drag it clear.''
Mr Faulkner said two Spanish line-fishing boats were nearby but were
unharmed. After the incident, on Thursday of last week, the Cornishmen
continued fishing.
''We had to, as the loss of that part of the net meant a large part of
our profit had gone,'' Mr Faulkner said.
The next day, HMS Orkney, a fishery protection vessel, had sent a
boarding party on to the Cornish boat. It was a routine check to see if
it was fishing legally.
''They are there to ensure such incidents do not occur. But they are
powerless to do anything after the incident,'' Mr Faulkner said.
As the Golden Bells II unloaded three tons of hake and white fish at
Newlyn, Mr Faulkner added: ''I have been fishing for 18 years and there
has always been trouble. I have lost thousands and thousands of pounds
worth of nets. These incidents are happening all the time. It seems that
more and more Spaniards are fishing.''
He said that only last week another Newlyn boat, the Holly Jane, had
its nets cut by two Spanish vessels while fishing 150 miles south west
of Land's End.
Mr Mike Townsend, chief executive of the Cornish Fish Producers'
Association, said he would be raising the incident with the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food.
''I see this as a very serious incident, which happened in UK
territorial waters,'' he said.
He pointed out that the Cornish fishing fleet was now approaching the
tuna fishing season.
Last year, there were numerous angry incidents involving British
fishermen and Spanish trawlermen in the so-called tuna wars.
Mr David Harris, Tory MP for St Ives and chairman of the party's
fisheries committee, said: ''This incident is worrying and could mean
there is serious trouble ahead.''
Mr Harris had contacted officials at the office of the Fisheries
Minister, Mr Michael Jack, yesterday, calling for better protection for
Cornish fishermen.
Mr Jack said extra money was being ploughed into both naval and aerial
protection and he was confident there would be adequate cover.
Nevertheless, he insisted there was little the authorities could have
done about the latest incident.
''The incident took place a week ago and I gather it was only reported
to the Royal Navy 12 hours after the incident took place, when HMS
Orkney carried out a routine inspection,'' he said on BBC Radio 4's The
World at One.
''The horse had bolted from the proverbial stable and it was very
difficult, particularly in the light of difficult conditions and the
worsening weather, to identify which Spanish vessel was the one
involved.''

Music
WITH Mozart's fourth horn concerto as the only popular work in a
concert otherwise devoted to music more obscure, the European Community
Chamber Orchestra did not come up with a winning box-office formula at
the Perth Festival on Wednesday.
But with young players as good as these -- most of them destined for
jobs in the cream of Europe's symphony orchestras -- even the unfamiliar
should have had its attractions as part of a programme that had in fact
been cleverly devised to contrast the Mozart concerto with a memorial to
Dennis Brain (Britain's most famous hornist, who died in a car accident
after the 1957 Edinburgh Festival) and the passionate lamentation of
Haydn's Mourning symphony.
David Matthews's Capriccio for two horns and strings was a beautiful,
atmospheric elegy, filled with nocturnal overtones of A Midsummer
Night's Dream: both Britten's and Mendelssohn's.
The echoing horn parts, before the music finally drifted into the
distance, were ravishingly played by the orchestra's own hornists, where
as the Mozart received a firmly measured performance from Barry
Tuckwell, playing with something less than his usual elan.
At the start of the evening, Columbus's Egg, a piece of Sicilian
minimalism composed by Giovanni Sollima in tribute to the great
fifteenth-century voyager, sounded like a curious mixture of Carl
Nielsen and Michael Nyman -- quite a curate's egg in fact. But the stark
dynamism of the Haydn, tautly directed by Elvind Aaland from the first
violin desk, was unmistakably and very properly the concert's climax.

Tim Judah reports from the Bosnian Serb mountain headquarters at Pale
how the leadership and the people are quite unperturbed in the eye of
the international storm.
PRESIDENTS and Prime Ministers are in despair. Thousands of British
soldiers have been told to prepare to leave for Bosnia. The French and
Americans have despatched aircraft carriers to the Adriatic, and world
leaders rage that they will not be blackmailed by the Bosnian Serbs. So
what does Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, have to say about
it all? Remarkably little, it would seem. In fact, ever since his men
took 371 United Nations soldiers hostage last week the Bosnian Serb
leader has barely been seen.
So, where is he? ''He is where he should be,'' is the laconic reply of
Aleksa Buha, the foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb
Republic. In fact, Mr Karadzic was sighted yesterday. Slipping out of
church, he made, under the circumstances, the rather banal remark that
the UN detainees could go ''if the international community is ready to
promote political talks and political solutions and cease its violence
against us''.
Such a comment reflects the bizarrely relaxed atmosphere of Pale, the
Bosnian Serb mountain capital whose outskirts came under Nato
bombardment on May 25 and 26. As a military and diplomatic storm rages
around them, both the Bosnian Serb leadership and ordinary people remain
curiously unmoved. They are, it seems, living in the still eye of the
hurricane.
Considering the havoc wrought not just in Bosnia but on the fabric of
world politics by the Bosnian Serb leadership, first-time visitors to
Pale are often shocked by what they find. Far from being a bristling
armed camp and Bosnian Sparta, the former ski resort is little more than
a one-horse town. It has one main street, three video clubs, a couple of
shops, a few cafes and a population of barely more than 20,000.
But it's here in offices, in an old hotel, an engine factory, and now
a brand new government building that Bosnian Serb leaders are plotting
their next move. Miroslav Toholj, the minister of information, says that
if the international community proposes to sit down and discuss the
release of the UN detainees and simultaneously give promises that there
will be no more airstrikes, ''then that's alright with us''. It is a
proposal angrily rejected by the UN. So, the hatches are battened down
again and for another 24 hours or so no-one is likely to say anything.
This has been the worst Bosnian crisis since February 1994 when the
Serbs, threatened then with Nato airstrikes, were forced to pull back
their heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. The
''total exclusion zone'' which followed has since crumbled away. Because
of the hostage crisis Nato cannot now hit Serb positions for fear of
killing the UN troops who have been placed around them.
The root of the crisis is the unresolved question of the UN-declared
''safe areas''. The Serbs say that their enemies have used these for
staging attacks but that when they mount a counter-offensive they are
condemned for hitting what is supposed to be a ''safe area''.
Politically it is difficult, if not impossible, for the UN to demand
that the army of Bosnia's legitimate government be disarmed in its
capital and in other besieged areas such as Bihac and Gorazde. However,
as this crisis has proved, the present arrangement is clearly untenable.
These are conclusions that Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN Secretary
General, has now confirmed, leaving the Security Council to grapple with
the problem of ''what next?''
It is a highly unstable situation and any false move, the death of
some hostages or the shooting down of a Nato jet, could easily provoke a
new, and uncontrollable, cycle of violence.
So in Pale they say they hope that some diplomats show up soon to
begin mediating. For several days the refrain of ''the Russians are
coming'' was whispered around town but none came. Then suddenly there
was a flurry of activity as Nikola Koljevic, the Bosnian Serb
vice-president, sped off to see Ivor Roberts, Britain's senior diplomat
in Belgrade. And then Pale went quiet again. The waiting game continues.
The Serb strategy is to attempt to use this cirisis to reopen the
whole political and diplomatic process from which they have been
excluded since last summer. Then, they rejected the current peace plan
for Bosnia, insisting that their self-proclaimed republic must receive
international recognition. ''Out of the question,'' insist the various
peace mediators who come and go in this part of the world. So,
nonchalantly, Mr Buha says that the future holds either ''total
disaster'' or a fresh international conference on former Yugoslavia.
The leadership in Pale is certainly over-optimistic in believing that
it can force the world to recognise its political demands but the West
is equally so if it believes that the present crisis will fundamentally
change things on the ground. While there will probably be more foreign
troops in more defendable positions, once the hostages are released the
basic political stalemate will remain. A recognition of Bosnia by
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic will help Serbia have sanctions
lifted but there is no reason to believe it will affect the killing
fields of the benighted republic.
So, as the fury rages around them, ordinary people carry on their
daily lives unperturbed. But every now and then there is a sudden
jolting reminder of what this particular crisis is all about. On a road
out of town, a Brazilian and a Pole sit blindfolded in their stolen
United Nations car before being driven off to be filmed.
Another UN car is put to more philanthropic purposes. Coming to a halt
outside Pale's only patisserie, 12 squealing children pour out for
cakes. More chilling though, a captured blue helmet sits atop a model
skull mounted on a car bonnet.
While the world worries about the UN hostages what worries most
ordinary Bosnian Serbs is simply making ends meet and feeding their
families. For those with work, the average monthly salary is the
equivalent of #8, barely enough for a couple of meals let alone anything
extra. Until now the Bosnian Serbs have used Yugoslav dinars but because
of the embargo from Serbia these are running out. So some people get
their salary in cigarettes. As for soldiers, they were recently paid --
for what was owed to them in June, 1994.

Messina, Thursday
FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd is expected to arrive here tomorrow for
the launch of talks which will decide the political direction of the
European Union into the early years of next century.
Mr Hurd's presence will be seen as more than a formality. After
speculation last week that he would be absent, pleading the need to be
on hand for developments in Bosnia, his arrival will be seen as a sign
that Britain will take a central part in the debate although the work of
setting down the detailed agenda will fall to Mr David Davis, Minister
for Europe, who is a noted Euro-sceptic.
The Government is acutely aware that UK participation in the
conference, which will lay the ground rules for next year's super-summit
on the revision of the Maastricht Treaty, will be watched closely by
Tory Euro-sceptics for any sign of British concessions to federalism.
Ministers of the EU's 15 member states will gather in the Sicilian
town of Messina on the 40th anniversary of the Messina conference which
gave birth to the Treaty of Rome and the Common Market which has since
become the European Union.
The 1955 conference was attended by the six founding member states of
today's EU but the UK decided not to take part. Tomorrow's meeting --
billed officially as a ''celebration'' of four decades of European
integration -- will involve Britain in resisting moves to dilute the
national veto.
Other topics which Britain is sworn to block are more powers for the
European Parliament and the growing influence of the smaller EU states.
Mr Major has already vowed to veto any further integrationist moves --
a negotiating stance which others have described as unrealistic, given
the attitudes of many of Britain's EU partners who lean towards a more
federalist view of Europe as it prepares for the membership of East
European former communist states.
Most of the talking will involve proposed methods of making the
Maastricht Treaty more workable. This means more efficient
decision-making in the critical fields of foreign affairs and a common
justice policy.
Since Maastrict, most member states have come to accept that a lack of
qualified majority voting in these areas has meant unacceptably slow
progress as governments have blocked a series of proposals.
Most recently, the UK stood aloof from the removal of internal
borders. Britain will also come under pressure to drop its opt-out from
Maastricht's social chapter.
Some observers believe Britain will be isolated in its refusal to
accept a pooling of inter-governmental powers which, Mr Major believes,
involves an unacceptable loss of sovereignty.

Barclay McBain meets the man facing the task of persuading parents
that closing schools will mean a better education for their children.
DR MALCOLM GREEN, recently appointed education spokesperson for the
new City of Glasgow council, teaches Roman history at Glasgow
University. So his words should be heeded when he says: ''Change has to
be welcomed and worked with and shaped. We should not be frightened by
it, but neither should we ignore it.''
Change is all around in education, and its consequences will be
particularly felt in Glasgow, the biggest single-tier council to be
created out of local government reform, and the one which, arguably,
faces the biggest problems, not least in respect of its schools.
Frank Pignatelli, Strathclyde region's director of education, has told
Glasgow's 300 heads that whoever is responsible for the service in the
city, will have to convince parents and teachers that school closures
are a good thing, if handled sensitively. ''You need to be clear that if
you keep places you don't need, you are spending money that could
otherwise be spent on teaching and learning,'' he said.
Glasgow will have to tackle the issue of school closures. Its 39
secondary schools can accommodate 51,883 pupils, but they have a surplus
of 22,258 places, giving an overall occupancy rate of 57%. The city has
benefited from the economies of scale which come from being part of
Strathclyde, and the wealth redistribution policies which the authority
has adopted.
But even if the region was to continue in existence, it would have to
do something about the city's surplus places. And from next April,
Glasgow will be exposed in financial terms, highlighting the need to
give value for money -- in schools and elsewhere.
Glasgow's relative poverty has led to fears that the revenue budget
allocation from the Scottish Office will not reflect the city's levels
of deprivation. And if current difficulties in collecting the council
tax continue, there will be added pressure on the revenue budget.
Dr Green said: ''The Scottish Office will have to recognise historical
patterns of expenditure for revenue support grant and rate-capping
decisions. To move to a new formula would be catastrophic for many
authorities. I cannot believe that the Scottish Office, if presented
with the facts, will attempt to do that.''
He will not be frightened by change. Nor will he shirk the
responsibilities which come with it. He has been through it all before,
as chairman of Strathclyde region's education committee from 1982 to
1990. He was involved in the region's highly unpopular Adapting to
Change proposals for bringing falling attendance rolls into line with
surplus places.
In the event, it did not result in the expected number of school
closures, partly because councillors and officials failed to convince
the public that there was more to the strategy than saving money: that
merged schools could actually improve the quality of education by
offering a wider curriculum.
Glasgow's policy on surplus places will become clearer in the coming
months. The city will appoint a director of education this week and, in
all likelihood, Dr Green will become chairman of the education committee
when it is established. Emphasising that he was speaking in a personal
capacity, he said he would like the new education committee to have a
role which went beyond rubber-stamping final decisions. ''I would want
to involve the elected members because they all have a responsibility
for education,'' he said.
In reality, two of the three options for dealing with surplus places
-- doing nothing, or putting more money into schools and thereby
starving other services -- are non-starters, which leaves the third --
closures and mergers.
''If we decided that some rationalisation was desirable, would we do
it purely for financial reasons, or would there be curricular
implications as well? This is an issue for the secondary rather than the
primary sector. There is a lot of evidence that it becomes difficult for
a secondary school, once its roll dips below 500 pupils, to offer a full
curriculum.
''There are increasing difficulties and people have to weigh up
whether these difficulties are worth living with. If you live on Tiree
they clearly are, otherwise you would have to go to the mainland. If you
are on the South Side of Glasgow, the question is much sharper because
the next school is not very far away.
''If a school is in serious disrepair and requires a couple of million
pounds to restore or rebuild it, then clearly that has to be an issue
because the capital monies are controlled by the Government, and money
spent there will not be spent elsewhere. There are also running costs,
and heating is the most obvious. If you burn money to heat spaces that
are under-used then that money isn't available elsewhere. Money is not
an elastic commodity in an authority.''
Dr Green envisages the remainder of the ''shadow year'' being taken up
with establishing the facts of over-provision, with councillors being
invited to agree on a strategy after April next year. ''I would see us
taking another few months to produce draft consultative documents. That
would take us into 1997, perhaps even 1998. This is an issue which
cannot be avoided but it is one we must take time over.
''The only way in which it would be prudent politically and in
educational terms to tackle this unavoidable responsibility, would be
through establishing the facts, understanding the implications of these
facts, weighing up all possible alternative strategies so that whatever
we arrived at had been thoroughly understood and had involved parental
and teacher opinion, and had not just been restricted to a dialogue
between the director of education and some councillors.''
Dr Green hopes that, if the ruling Glasgow Labour group agrees on a
rationalisation strategy, the Scottish Office will increase the city's
annual capital allocation and allow it to sweeten the closure pill by
making more money available for upgrading facilities in merging schools.
He accepts that he and his colleagues will be the subject of parental
ire if -- when -- schools close. He would be worried if parents were not
deeply anxious about any proposal to change the status of their
children's school. But he said: ''Part of the process, if that is what
it is to be, must involve a constant effort to demonstrate to
communities that in making a sacrifice of a school the quality of
education will be enhanced, which means that we have to have a clear
policy of ring-fencing savings.
''It is not an attempt to dictate from on-high so that some people
gain and others lose out. If a community is losing a school I think it
is right to expect a proportion of the benefits. Whether it is 50% or
100% is something we can argue about.''

Ankara, Thursday
TURKEY went ahead with scheduled military exercises in the Aegean Sea
today, restating its opposition to any possible Greek enforcement of a
treaty giving Athens the right to extend its territorial waters.
''The ratification in the Greek parliament of the 1982 Law of the Sea
treaty has not in any way changed Turkey's views on the territorial
waters problems in the Aegean,'' the foreign ministry said in a brief
statement after Athens voted to ratify the treaty early today.
The Turkish government has long said any attempt by Nato ally Greece
to enforce the treaty in the Aegean would be grounds for war. Greece has
not said it will actually enforce the accord.
The age-old tensions between the two countries resurfaced when the
Greek parliament ratified the Law of the Sea, giving Athens the right to
extend its territorial waters.
Turkey restated its opposition and began scheduled military land, air
and sea manoeuvres around the Aegean Sea.
But it later played down the Greek move, saying it was not a reason
for war.
Western analysts said that despite past rhetoric and belligerent
stances on both sides it was unlikely the two Nato members would allow
the dispute to develop into actual conflict.
Ratification of the treaty gives Athens the right to double its
territorial waters to 12 nautical miles when it wants, although Greece
has not actually said it would do so.
''Greece will exercise its rights whenever its interests dictate,''
Deputy Foreign Minister George Mangakis told parliament in Athens before
it voted.
''Turkey's war threats are nothing more than expressions of
nervousness over its internal problems,'' Mangakis said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters: ''This is nothing
but Greece's ratifying the decision taken by the law of the sea
conference.''
''Greece has promised not to put it into effect . . . (it) is not a
cause for war.''
But Inonu, who said he was hoping to hold talks with Greece, said
Turkey would see Greek enforcement of the 1982 Law of the Sea treaty as
a hostile act.
Western diplomats in Athens say it is unlikely Greece will try to
extend its waters, an act that Turkey says would limit its movements and
infringe on mineral and fishing rights because of the many Greek islands
near Turkey's western coast.
Ankara, which is worried the move would turn the Aegean into a ''Greek
lake'', has refused to sign the Law of the Sea.

Oslo, Thursday
THE Norwegian government today set up a crisis group to help combat
the worst floods to hit the country for 125 years.
Melting snow and heavy rains have flooded rivers, cutting off roads,
covering farmland and isolating sparsely populated districts in
southeastern Norway north of Oslo.
A government spokesman said the crisis group had begun to coordinate
rescue work through various ministries and local authorities.
He added: ''The government considers declaring some districts disaster
areas.''
The Norwegian Water and Electricity Authority said snow and ice had
started melting three weeks later than usual. Heavy rains helped trigger
the floods this week.
Meanwhile, 12 people were injured and several dug out of the snow
after a series of avalanches on the route of the Giro d'Italia cycle
race in the Alps today.
Two people suffered broken legs. Two cars, including that of a Swiss
journalist following the race, had to be dug out from the snow.
In Iran, 12 people were killed by flooding and lightning as torrential
spring rains swept the country, Iranian media said on today.
In Khavarshahr, a poor district nine miles southeast of Tehran, floods
struck yesterday after an hour-long heavy rain, killing at least 10
people, Iran's news agency Irna said.
About 50 houses and dozens of cars were destroyed by the floods that
overturned two minibuses and washed away trees, IRNA said.

SOUTH Africa's blacks should give sympathetic consideration to

Mandela said today.
He warned a meeting of the Senate against quick dismissal of the idea
of Afrikaner self-rule because of the contribution made by white Freedom
Front leader Constand Viljoen in last year's historic all-race elections
that brought the ANC to power.
Viljoen broke away from the far right to form the FF and take part in
the elections. His party won several seats and sits in South Africa's
black-dominated parliament.
The party had pressed for an Afrikaner homeland during the elections
but earlier this year admitted that most Afrikaners knew this would
still be a dream even ''in 15 to 20 years from now''.
Mandela told the Senate: ''It is easy for you to say no Volkstaat in
this country. That's easy for you because you have not done the work,
you do not know what dangers we have averted.
''Through confidential discussions without publicity, we were able to
get some of those people whose plans were finalised to plunge this
country into blood, we were able to bring them round,'' he said.
Mandela said he would give sensitive consideration to the first report
of the Volkstaat Council, which last week submitted initial proposals
for a homeland defined in terms of language and culture, rather than
race.
The council was set up to look into Afrikaner demands for
self-determination in an area of their own.
* President Mandela said today he had ordered security guards to
protect his party's headquarters against rival black demonstrators
''even if you have to kill people''.
Eight people died outside the Johannesburg headquarters of the ANC in
March last year when Inkatha supporters marched in support of their Zulu
king and against the following month's all-race elections.--Reuter.

Canberra, Thursday
WRONG treatment probably killed 10,000 to 14,000 patients in
Australian hospitals in 1992, according to a study released by the
government.
Between 25,000 and 30,000 people would have experienced ''an adverse
event'' as a result of treatment resulting in some degree of permanent
disability, said Health Minister Carmen Lawrence.
She told parliament the ''disturbing figures'' were based on a medical
team's study of records of 14,000 admissions to 28 public and private
hospitals in the states of New South Wales and South Australia.
The findings were regarded as an interpretation of what was happening
in hospitals Australia-wide in 1992, Lawrence said, adding that the
government would increase health spending to help alleviate the problems
raised by the study.
An ''adverse event'' was defined as an unintended injury caused by
procedures which resulted in patients' temporary or permanent
disability, prolonged length of stay or death.
It involved instances such as wrong medicine being prescribed, failure
to notice a bad test result, or accidental perforation of organs or
severing of nerves during surgery.
Lawrence stressed that most of the patients would have been very ill,
undergoing complex and intensive treatment, and in general probably
elderly.--Reuter.

Brussels, Thursday
SCOTS author Robert Louis Stevenson described him as a dirty, bigoted,
untruthful man, but one who should be hailed as a saint and hero for his
selfless work with lepers on a remote Hawaiian island.
The subject of this double-edged praise was Father Damien, the
Belgian-born priest due to be beatified by Pope John Paul II this Sunday
for his work on Molokai island where he lived with about 1000 lepers
until he died of the disease himself in 1889.
In the Roman Catholic Church, beatification is the last step before
sainthood. The beatified are called ''blessed'' and can be venerated in
a limited way.
Usually the beatification ceremony is performed in Rome, but the Pope
made an exception after Belgium's Catholic leader wrote to him
suggesting the ceremony be held on the controversial priest's home
ground.
The Belgian Catholic Church said it was anxious to highlight a figure
who symbolised hope and comfort for people afflicted by an incurable
illness. Leprosy can now be treated and while Aids has not been
mentioned, it is hoped the beatification of Damien will give some hope
to Aids sufferers.
Born Jozef de Veuster in 1840, Father Damien spent his early years in
the Flemish village of Tremelo in northern Belgium before entering a
nearby monastery with his brother just before his 17th birthday.
The church initially asked Father Damien's brother to go to Hawaii,
but ill health prevented him from making the punishing five-month boat
trip. Father Damien was sent instead.
The priest was only meant to spend three months on Molokai, but he
soon told the church he wanted to devote his life to helping lepers.
Jozef Eraly, one of about 100 surviving relatives of Father Damien,
sees his distant uncle as a symbol of hope for all people considered as
outcasts.
''For our family he is a hero and we are very proud that he is a
great, great uncle,'' he told Reuters. ''Damien is very significant for
our lives as he is an example of a man who goes to people who are
outcasts, like many people are today.''
The head of the Father Damien Museum in Tremelo is not oblivious to
some of the failings of the priest, whom he described as hot-headed and
anti-authority.
''He was often a very difficult man who had problems with authority in
the church. But he did a very good job with the lepers and the church
realises that,'' said Father Albert.
Others have slandered Father Damien's memory. An Australian priest,
Father Hyde, questioned his vows of chastity and said he had contracted
leprosy through his vices and carelessness.
The writer Stevenson jumped to Damien's defence, pointing out he was a
regular man.
''The maidens of Hawaii have never been known to be diffident with
their charms and undoubtedly many a sly glance of coquetry was turned on
the lonely white resident,'' he wrote.--Reuter.

Lord Owen's resignation as European peace negotiator sees another
ambitious undertaking crumble, as Stephen McGregor reports.
IT was in a dark and dingy lounge bar in Bootle five years ago that Dr
David Owen's mainstream political career came to an end. All the dreams
and strategies of the Social Democratic Party collapsed and faded.
A few disinterested journalists took notes as he pronounced yet again
on the need for proportional representation and for deals and pacts with
other parties.
Humiliation was to follow. The party's candidate in the Bootle
by-election, Jack Holmes, came seventh out of the eight candidates,
polling precisely 155 votes and trailing 263 votes behind Lord David
Sutch's Raving Loony Party.
Within weeks, the party hierarchy held a crisis summit in a London
hotel and decided it was all over.
The wilderness beckoned, but in August, 1992, Mr John Major recognised
the talents of the now Lord Owen, and declared that he would succeed
Lord Carrington as the European peace negotiator in the former
Yugoslavia.
That dream, too, has now been shattered with Lord Owen's confirmation
that he is to resign from the role at the end of this month.
He is a thoughtful, though not always quiet, man who, along with first
Cyrus Vance and then Torvald Stoltenberg worked as hard as anyone could
to sort out the mess that is the Bosnian crisis.
In his House of Lords speech on Wednesday, Lord Owen gave more than a
hint of the frustration he feels over the Bosnian situation. He appeared
tired but he was listened to in the respectful silence reserved for
someone who knows what they are on about.
''Hopefully we will hear a little less from the lap-top bombardiers
and a little more of the voice of compromise and reason. I wish I could
have been able to give you more concrete evidence of the endeavours we
have undertaken in trying to achieve peace.''
And crucially: ''Are British forces being sucked ever more into a
Balkan war as a combatant, on the back of a UN humanitarian
intervention? Sadly, my answer is that we are, and we need to be very
clear about what is involved if we are to go down this route.''
Owen is now approaching his 57th birthday and probably knows in his
heart of hearts that in his history there are lots of might-have-beens.
He was the youngest Foreign Secretary in recent times when appointed by
Jim Callaghan in 1977, and was seen by many as a likely future leader of
the Labour Party.
But disagreements over Europe and increasing disenchantment with
Labour's hard left drove him out and into the bright new dawn of the
Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins, Bill Rodgers SDP, which was meant to
break the mould of British politics.
Disenchantment followed, and there was a spectacular split with the
Liberals during the conference season of 1986 when the two ''Alliance''
parties ended up facing in different directions over nuclear weapons.
The then Liberal leader, Mr (now Sir) David Steel, flew to London for
a meeting with Dr Owen and, while they were eventually able to cobble
together a form of words which took them through the 1987 election, the
relationship between the two men never recovered.
The Liberal Democrats were formed, despite an impassioned plea by Owen
at the 1987 Portsmouth conference for the SDP to ''keep its nerve'', and
he was sidelined. Owen says he wept in his hotel room.
He certainly is an exceptional politician, but with one great fault. A
man who, when he was at the forefront of British politics, preached
compromise, he found it almost impossible to compromise and find the
middle ground with other parties -- or even his own party -- when it
mattered. But what sort of compromise is on offer in Bosnia? Perhaps,
after all, he should have stuck with it.

THE summer holiday price war is hotting up, with big discounts being
offered by high street giant Thomas Cook.
The company's customers can get #110 per person off selected 14-night
breaks to five popular European resorts.
The discounts apply to adult prices on breaks in Majorca, Menorca, the
Algarve, and the Greek islands of Corfu and Kos. They are valid for
departures between July 10 and September 3.
The Thomas Cook move follows last week's initiative by the UK's
biggest travel agents, Lunn Poly, which cut #100 off the price of many
June holidays.
In a further offer, BA Holidays said it was offering a free two-night
Paris city break for customers booking 14-day holidays at selected
resorts in Mauritius and the Bahamas.
According to figures from Lunn Poly, the 10 most popular destinations
already booked for summer 1995 are: 1 Spain 42%; 2 Greece 14%; 3 Turkey
7%; 4 USA 5%; 5 France 5%; 6 Portugal 4%; 7 Cyprus 4%; 8 Italy 3%; 9
Caribbean 3%; 10 Malta 2%.
Thanks to particularly cheap prices, Turkey has enjoyed a spectacular
increase in UK tourist numbers this year. Florida is also doing well
after numbers dipped last year because of crime fears.
Other growth areas include France -- boosted by the Channel Tunnel --
and the Caribbean, which has been helped by new charters to the
Dominican Republic.
On long-haul routes, Florida, with 39% of bookings, is the top
destination, followed by the Caribbean (24%), the rest of the US (15%),
Canada (7%), Kenya (4%), the Far East (4%), and India (3%).

[+/-] TECHNICAL problem has been blamed for trials of a new electronic
tagging system for criminals being postponed. They were due to start
next week.
The Home Office was hoping to have the system up and running as a
sentencing option in Manchester within days of the trials.
Rigorous tests have found that the tags, imported from the US, do not
work properly.
It is the second time the trials have been delayed.
Ministers originally had wanted to begin the #1.4m nine-month pilot
project in January but it is thought to have been put back because of a
lack of interest and high bids from contractors.
Securicor, which will run the trials in Reading and Manchester, said a
''minor technical problem'' had been identified during tests.
The tags, designed for fitting to a convicted offender's ankle or
wrist, should trigger an alarm if he or she leaves home during any
''curfew'' period.
It is thought officials simulated home conditions and found that the
tags were not triggering the alarm when they should.
The use of tags is widely opposed within the criminal justice system,
with probation officers claiming they are a waste of money and some
magistrates questioning whether they would actually work.
The reform group, the Penal Affairs Consortium, said today the trials
were a ''misguided experiment and classic case of throwing good money
after bad''.
However, Home Secretary Michael Howard is determined to press ahead
with the system.
The trials are now due to start in a month.

A HIGH Court trial erupted in anger yesterday when a judge acquitted a
man charged with murder.
At the High Court in Airdrie, Lord Coulsfield formally acquitted Mr
William Wotherspoon, 24, of a charge of murdering Mr Francis McMillan.
Mr Wotherspoon's defence advocate, Mr Ian Hamilton QC, successfully
argued that, under Scots Law, his client's alleged confession was not
enough to convict his client as there was no corroboration.
Mr Kevin Hardy, 20, of Holytown Road, Bellshill, Mr Wotherspoon's
co-accused, is still on trial charged with Mr McMillan's murder. He pled
not guilty to the charge.
Mr McMillan died in hospital as a result of burns 17 days after a
petrol attack on his flat.
There were cries of ''animal'' and ''rat'' from the public benches as
Mr Wotherspoon, of Sunnyside Avenue, Holytown, Lanarkshire, left the
dock.
Last night, Mr McMillan's widow, Liz, 26, who is expecting their third
child, said: ''It is unbelievable that this has happened. I thought the
jury decided who was guilty and who was not.
''I can't believe the judge acquitted this man.''
Earlier in the trial, Mr Wotherspoon's ex-girlfriend, Ms Gillian
Hannah, 20, claimed that Mr Wotherspoon had ''boasted'' about carrying
out the fire attack.
She said: ''Wotherspoon told me that he and Hendry had gone to get
petrol, put it in a pot, and thrown it over Mr McMillan.''
The court had also heard how Mr Hendry and Mr Wotherspoon, who ran a
waste disposal company, were given a cheque for #4000 by Mr McMillan,
who wanted to ''come in'' in the company.
The cheque bounced and led to a feud between the men.
In evidence, Mr Hendry said he bought petrol in a can from a garage an
hour before Mr McMillan was seen fleeing his flat still on fire.
He claimed Mr Wotherspoon had told him to buy the petrol and that Mr
Wotherspoon had put it in a pot and carried it to Mr McMillan's flat.
The trial continues.

A SCHOOLGIRL told the High Court in Perth yesterday that she was raped
twice after being pulled from a city centre telephone kiosk.
The 15-year-old was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Edward
Townsley, 21, and William McIntyre, 17, both described as prisoners at
Perth Prison.
They deny pulling her into a close in South Street, Perth, last
February, striking her head against a wall and on the ground, rendering
her unconscious, undressing her, and repeatedly raping her.
Mr Townsley also denied indecently assaulting a friend of the girl,
also 15, with intent to rape her.
The alleged rape victim said she and her friend were about to make a
call from a kiosk at 8pm when six youths appeared outside.
She said she was grabbed from behind, pulled out of the kiosk, and
pushed along a dark alley. Then her head was knocked against a wall
until she lost consciousness.
She continued: ''When I came round, I was lying on my back on the
ground with someone on top of me. He was having sex with me.''
The girl said she lost consciousness again when her head was banged on
the ground and awoke to find a second man on top of her, having sex.
Then there was a commotion and the police arrived.
The girl, who said she had not had sex before that night, agreed she
initially gave police a false name and age and, with her friend, tried
to run from the police.
She added: ''We were in shock and wanted to get away. I wasn't
thinking properly. I thought I would get into trouble as I had been
drinking earlier.''
The trial continues.

THE National Trust for Scotland has ruled itself out as potential
buyers of the Lovat family seat, Beaufort Castle.
The 23-room castle, 12 miles from Inverness, was put on the market for
#1.5m this week along with #4.5m worth of land.
A spokesman for the trust said yesterday: ''Simply, we haven't got the
cash. Money is very tight. We have just recently acquired Mar Lodge with
the help of a lottery donation and from a charitable trust.
''We do not have the finance to buy estates. There has been no
suggestion that we should take an interest. If someone were to come
along offering to put up the money to keep ownership in Scotland, then
our council would obviously consider it.
''However, at the moment, I have no knowledge of even a remote
interest in anyone doing that.''
Prospective purchasers are having to pay #20 a time for the elaborate
32-page brochures. Three thousand have been printed.
It is not normal for an estate agents to charge for selling a
brochure. The money will help defray the marketing costs which the
cash-strapped Lovat family will have to pay the estate agents when a
sale is made.
It is hoped that West End impresario Cameron Mackintosh, who last year
bought part of the Lovat estate at Morar in Lochaber, might show an
interest.
Entrepreneur Peter de Savary has converted Andrew Carnegie's Skibo
Castle in Sutherland into a country club and championship golf course,
and Beaufort Castle could be similarly used.
Before he died, the Master of Lovat had a vision of a #100m
development.
Spurred on by Frasers in California and Australia who felt there was
no focal point for the clan to celebrate their colourful history, Simon
Fraser envisaged a centre incorporating archives, museum, and genealogy
section.
The centre, along with a golf course of international standards, was
to have formed Phase I of the Master's plan.
This was to have been followed by a four-star 100-bedroom hotel and
related recreational facilities.
All but the debts incurred in the running of the Lovat estate fizzled
out after the death of the Master in March 1994.

THREE hundred men were paid off yesterday at the American-owned BARMAC
oil rig construction yard at Ardersier, near Inverness, reducing the
workforce to 700.
Approximately 50 of yesterday's redundancies, which follow the
completion of a platform for the Ganymede gas field, off East Anglia,
involved men who had been temporarily transferred from the firm's other
yard at Nigg, on the Cromarty Firth.
The yards were merged under one management earlier this year and a
strike at Nigg -- over eligibility for redundancy -- will end with a
return to work by 630 hourly-paid workers on Monday.
However, there is better news on the horizon for the Ardersier yard.
It is favourite to win a contract to build a multi-million-pound
gas-compression platform and topsides for the Caister and Murdoch fields
off Lincolnshire, which are jointly operated by French oil company Total
and US company Conoco.
Meanwhile, oil started to flow from Scotland's newest oilfield when
the supertanker Savonita began loading yesterday morning from the
Schiehallion field, 93 miles west of Shetland.
The tanker will take 40 days to take on a full cargo of crude oil from
the BP field, which lies in 1200ft of water and is exposed to some of
the world's roughest seas.
The company describes the load-up as an extended test flow, which is
designed to check the characteristics of Schiehallion's reservoir and to
see how its oil actually performs when processed in a refinery in
Europe.
The field, the second to be tapped in Britain's ''new' Atlantic oil
province, is expected to be in full production by 1998.
It lies just a few miles from BP's Foinaven Field, which is due to
come on stream next spring.
Meanwhile, a substantial part of the contract for the planned
ship-shaped Floating Production and Storage Offshore (FPSO) system, for
Schiehallion, is likely to be won at home.
British firms figure prominently in the two consortia which have been
short-listed by BP for the multi-million- pound contract.
The Atlantic fields are both named after Scottish mountains.

THE world's banking system rapidly closed the net around newspaper
tycoon Robert Maxwell in the hours before his death at sea on Guy Fawkes
Day in 1991, a jury heard yesterday.
It was claimed that loans the Maxwell group of companies were in no
position to pay were being called in.
Mr Maxwell, flamboyant owner of the Mirror group of newspapers, which
included the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, had been ducking and
diving for months in a bid to get on top of his group's liquidity
crisis, counsel declared.
It was all going to become very public on November 6, when a bank was
prepared to reveal that the Maxwell group was defaulting on loans.
The jury was told that Robert Maxwell died on the eve of the
declaration by the bank, knowing full well that if it was made public
that his companies were defaulting on loans the whole group would
collapse.
Two of his sons are on trial for alleged fraud. Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36,
of Oxfordshire, denies conspiring with his late father to defraud the
trustees and beneficiaries of the pension fund by misusing Scitex
shares.
Mr Maxwell, his brother Ian, 38, of Westminster, and former financial
adviser Larry Trachtenberg, 42, of Hampstead, West London, and
ex-company accountant Robert Bunn, 47, of Hertfordshire, deny a similar
charge relating to #22m worth of shares in Israeli pharmaceuticals
company Teva.
The court heard that security for bank loans granted to Mr Maxwell's
group of companies was guaranteed by shares that belonged to employee
pension funds. These shares were illegally used in a bid to prop up the
Maxwell group.
On the night Robert Maxwell died, he knew full well one bank in
particular was about to declare that his major companies were in default
of a loan, counsel said. Such an announcement would almost certainly
have brought about the collapse of the whole group.
At the time, Robert Maxwell's son Kevin knew exactly what was going on
and that shares worth #100m which belonged to employee pension funds
were being used fraudulently to secure massive loans from the world's
banks, it was alleged.
The Crown maintains that Mr Kevin Maxwell and his father conspired to
misuse these shares.
However, not even the #100m raised from the sale of pension fund
shares could cover the amounts owing to various banks and lies were told
in a bid to cover up the perilous state of the Maxwell group, Mr Alan
Suckling told the court.
Pension fund shares in an Israeli company were used as collateral to
cover loans to the Maxwell group from various banks. The QC told the
court that money realised from these shares could not possibly cover the
whole debt owed to banks.
These were the circumstances in which Mr Robert Maxwell and his son
Kevin siphoned millions of pounds from the pension funds to keep the
group afloat, the jury was told.
Mr Kevin Maxwell was well aware of what was going on and was a
principal signatory on documents dealing with the fraud, the Crown
alleges.
Mr Robert Maxwell knew his group was in serious financial difficulties
by December, 1990. At that stage, debts of the group could have been as
high as #845m.
Prosecuting counsel told the court that the company at that time took
legal advice over the liquidity of the group. This advice was that once
a director knew the company was going into insolvent liquidation, he was
obliged to do everything he could to minimise potential loss.
The normal test of a going concern, as far as companies were
concerned, was whether that company was able to meet its debts when they
fell due. Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell chose to take a chance and
use Scitex shares, held in trust on behalf of pensioners and employees,
to help the group out of its financial difficulties, Mr Suckling
declared.
The group had its back to the wall and this was one possible way out.
However, the shares were not theirs to use. They belonged to the
employees' funds and were held in a regulated trust for present and
future pensioners. Bishopsgate Investment Management were the trustees.
A main role of trustees was to prevent putting fund assets at risk.
Both Maxwells were trustees. ''The prosecution case is that this is
exactly what Kevin and Robert Maxwell did quite deliberately,'' said Mr
Suckling.
The trial continues today.

A BLACK sales assistant who was told she was smelly and who was handed
a can of deodorant has won a claim of racial discrimination and
compensation of #4500.
Mrs Mercy Moyo, of Powis Circle, Aberdeen, was employed by the
clothing chain Mark-One at its shop in the city's Bon Accord shopping
centre.
An industrial tribunal in Aberdeen heard last month that the incident
happened in August last year, when the manager, Miss Linda Logan,
approached the assistant and asked her if she used a deodorant.
Later, another assistant gave her a can of deodorant and Mrs Moyo, 31,
from Zimbabwe, was told that a customer had complained she was smelly.
However, there was no record of such a complaint. Issuing its
unanimous decision yesterday, the tribunal said: ''It must have been a
particular shock to her to be told publicly that she needed to use a
deodorant and that she was the subject of complaints from customers that
she was the source of an unpleasant smell in the fitting rooms,
especially as the evidence suggested there was no foundation for that
charge.''
The tribunal said Mrs Moyo had suffered humiliation and distress and
ordered the company to pay the compensation for the unlawful
discrimination.

A SENIOR local authority figure has promised that the new Glasgow
council would embark on a programme of school closures only after a
lengthy period of open and honest consultation.
Dr Malcolm Green, a former chairman of Strathclyde region's education
committee who has been chosen to speak on education for the shadow
unitary council, said he hoped that any decisions about tackling the
large number of surplus places in Glasgow's schools could be taken in an
atmosphere of trust with parents and teachers.
The scale of the challenge has been recognised by Mr Ken Corsar, a
senior member of Strathclyde region's education department, who has been
appointed director of education for Glasgow.
He said yesterday: ''One of the big issues is going to be reconciling
provision with what we think might be a poor budget settlement, which
throws into sharp focus the precarious position of schools with small
rolls.
''One of the big worries facing us is trying to work with communities
and having disputes with them over the future of local schools. We will
have to work together to solve the problem, because it will not go away,
either educationally or financially.''
Councillors elected to the shadow council will have almost a year to
establish the facts about surplus places, which are particularly high in
the secondary sector.
Nearly 24% of Strathclyde region's pupils are educated in Glasgow but
the city has more than 22,000 empty desks in its secondary schools and
more than 32,000 surplus places in its primaries.
Dr Green said the council would not be rushed into any closure
programme. In an interview with The Herald, he said it could be 1988
before the council moved to close and merge schools -- if that was its
policy.
Dr Green, who emphasised he was speaking only for himself, said:
''What I have to do and the service has to do is convince people that,
in respect of any rationalisation, we only want the best education for
their children and the children in the rest of the city.''

A HEALTH board's inquiry into a nursing home has ended. It was held
because a BBC Scotland programme alleged ''appalling'' standards of care
for the elderly. It is understood that the documentary makers might now
face a series of legal actions in connection with the original
broadcast.
Lanarkshire Health Board last night declined to confirm or deny that
the inquiry had dismissed the central allegations in the Frontline
Scotland programme about conditions at Orchard House, Crossford,
Lanarkshire.
A statement from Professor Frank Clark, the board's general manager,
said only that the inquiry into aspects of the organisation and
management of Orchard House had been completed.
He added: ''A report is being compiled which will be the subject of
consideration by the board, following which we will take legal advice on
the appropriate course of action.''
In the programme, five registered or auxiliary nurses -- no longer
working at the home -- catalogued numerous indignities which would
breach the health board's guidelines.
Secret footage was at its most disturbing when showing a man allegedly
confined to a ''restricter'' chair for up to 24 hours a day and at risk
of strangulation if he slid down.
It is understood the inquiry casts serious doubts on the circumstances
in which the man was also filmed as he lay or crawled on a floor.
Health board members are expected to meet next week to receive the
inquiry report, which is thought to have uncovered only minor
irregularities -- if any -- at the home for 63 residents.
The BBC has already admitted that some film shots in the programme,
purported to illustrate scenes at Orchard House, were not filmed there.
Mr Raymond Baigent and his wife Margaret, the home owners, have
already raised an action of defamation at the Court of Session against
two of the former employees who appeared in the damning documentary.

IT is 250 years since Prince Charles Edward Stuart stepped off a small
boat on to the Hebridean island of Eriskay to mount the '45 Rebellion.
In commemoration of one of the most bloody and romantic episodes in
British history, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum today will open a
major exhibition, Bonnie Prince Charlie: Fact and Fiction.
Laid out as five distinct sections, the exhibition guides the visitor
through the political and family alliances of the time, traces Charlie's
arrival in Scotland through his campaign to the bloody battlefield of
Culloden, and its consequences for Highland culture, and looks at his
legacy to today's tourism industry, tea-towels and all.
The curator of arms and armour, Mr Robert Woosnam-Savage, said: ''It
is about a person trying to regain his father's throne, starting the
expedition with 12 men on a 44-gun frigate, landing in Scotland without
any French support guarantees, and what happens next . . . .''
The exhibition is gathered from private and public collections, with
many of the 100 objects on loan from the Queen. As Mr Woosnam-Savage
said: ''To the victor the spoils.''
''As a hill-walker myself, I have respect for anybody who can survive
on the Scottish hills for five months, he obviously had charisma, led
5000 men almost down to London, but his character was almost fatally
flawed in that he would not listen to subordinates who did know better
and that flawed nature led to drink and everything else,'' said Mr
Woosnam-Savage.
The exhibition ends on August 27.

THE father of a schoolboy whose application to Glasgow University's
medical school was rejected, despite having six Higher band A passes,
plans to challenge the decision in court.
Mr Brian O'Reilly said last night he was seeking a judicial review in
the Court of Session. He said every other attempt to have the decision
reversed had failed. He claimed his son Conor, 17, a pupil at Glasgow's
private St Aloysius College, was turned down earlier this year after a
five-minute interview with two university staff.
Conor, now studying for three A levels, was offered a place at
Scotland's other four medical schools but has turned them down. Mr
O'Reilly said his son wanted to go only to Glasgow University and would
apply again next year if the action failed.
He said he had warned the Principal, Sir William Kerr Fraser, he
planned to take legal action in the hope he would reconsider the case.
''I have spoken to the dean of the medical school, the dean of
admissions and the Principal. The university say they have never
reversed a decision before. My only choice now is to take legal action.
It seems a crazy way to get anyone into university but I feel I am in
the right.''
A university spokesman said only: ''If someone has the intention of
testing the proposition that applicants could use the courts to force
universities to accept them, then they should expect such a proposal to
be contested.''

<HEADLINE>Portrait of a street dealer</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978092311</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE changing face of the Strathclyde drugs scene and the changing face
of the dealers and pushers is painted for The Herald by Detective
Inspector Eddie McColm of Strathclyde Police Drugs Squad. It is not a
comforting one.
He talks of an alternative economy on the streets and throughout the
housing schemes, supported by an estimated 8500 to 10,000 intravenous
drug abusers in Greater Glasgow.
The same research indicates that approximately 33% to 40% of all young
people in Scotland experiment with cannabis and although the gateway
theory -- that cannabis leads on to other, often harder, drugs use -- is
often contested, all the circumstantial evidence points to its
correctness.
Most police officers who, after all, have most experience in this
field, subscribe to that view.
The police acknowledge that detection accounts for only approximately
10% of the illegal market.
One of the important points to emerge from the Government's study,
published last year, on the Scottish drugs scene was that the problem
was more complex than previously imagined.
The high levels of injecting in Scotland have helped spread HIV,
hepatitis B and C and have incurred an enormous cost in terms of damage
to families and communities. Drugs misuse may cost Scotland as much as
#50m a year.
Detective Inspector McColm says the street dealer will be in his teens
or early 20s and most probably unemployed. He is almost entirely
dependent on the drugs economy, selling small quantities to finance his
own habit. His health will be poor, his lifestyle very poor, and his
prospects extremely slim.
There is another, less common, form of dealing which involves people
at work. Occasionally it emerges that someone in a building or factory
knows the man in the next section who is always good for a bit of
cannabis for the weekend.
Back on the streets, the heroin addicts have their own grapevine. When
heroin is available they will appear as by magic, homing in on the shop
door or close where the deals can be made.
There are traditional dealing spots but the dealer will move the venue
slightly to stay one step ahead of the police.
The heroin user/ street dealer may buy 10 ''score'' bags -- a small
quantity worth #20 -- for roughly #150 and sell each one on for #20. He
will aim to sell seven or eight and keep the rest for himself. The money
appears to be going round and round in an alternative economy. And, says
Eddie McColm, it is undoubtedly a developing economy.
The street dealer is the visible face of this economy but behind the
scenes is the man who brings Temazepam up the motorway from England in
quantities of 20,000 or 50,000 or 80,000 capsules. Heroin no longer
comes up in ounces, but in kilos.
Police activity has changed the habits of the street dealer, making
him more organised. Many now operate from a safe house. Recently a woman
operating from a council house had one of her daughters as a customer.
Even after the child died of an overdose, the woman continued dealing.
Heroin in Glasgow has a purity of between 20 and 30% but at times of
high supply the drugs squad has seen the humble ''score'' bag growing in
size to half a gramme for around #30.
On the next stage up the ladder, the bigger dealer spends #25,000 to
#30,000 for a kilo of heroin. If he makes a good deal and gets a purity
level of 60% he can immediately cut that with glucose to make two kilos.
It may have taken this man some time to build up his trade, his network,
to reach that stage.

DRUGS dealers throughout Strathclyde were given notice yesterday that
their time is running out when Chief Constable Leslie Sharp announced
Operation Eagle and warned them: ''Get out. We mean business.'' Mr Sharp
intends to blitz the region's youngsters with the anti-drug message,
involving every agency in a partnership to educate, raise awareness and
divert young people away from the pushers.
Children as young as six will be given the drug awareness message in
the classroom. During this first 90-day period, normal police
enforcement on drugs will continue. Then, starting in September, will
come an unprecedented purge against dealers with which he intends to
tear the heart out of the drug culture which is increasingly widely
recognised as a running sore in Scotland.
Significantly, the chief constable came down hard against the
vociferous pro-legalisation lobby -- particularly in relation to
cannabis -- reflecting new thinking that far from being a harmless
''soft'' drug, cannabis is dangerous and damaging.
Every police division in Strathclyde has its plans for implementation
of Operation Eagle. It is expected that today senior police officers in
Ayr, which became the focus of attention after three youngsters died
from drug-related deaths at Hanger 13 in the town, will announce their
measures.
North Ayrshire Divisional Commander Martin Papworth said: ''Both plain
clothes and uniform police have been taken off normal duties in my
division to deal with this menace.
''There is no hiding for people involved in this crime.''
And one of the community policeman brought into the operation, PC Paul
Main said: ''It's not just the big towns that we will be covering but
every hamlet and village.''
Strathclyde has already made a major impact with earlier 90-day
operations, including the major offensive against knife carrying, an
intelligence-based attack on illegal guns, a drive against gang crime in
the East End, and a crackdown on housebreakers.
Now Mr Sharp appears to be ready to take on the biggest challenge of
all. He has stated in the past that, given proper resources, the police
can make very significant impacts on crime and that it was not necessary
for people and agencies to flap their hands helplessly in the face of
rising crime graphs.
Most police forces in the UK appear to have tacitly settled for a
level of drug abuse, a recognition of the intractable nature of the
problems involved.
Ironically, it has been the strategic overview of Strathclyde region
which has allowed and facilitated Mr Sharp's multi-agency approach to
tackling the drugs problem -- precisely at the time when the overview
will vanish in local government reorganisation.
As with most senior officers now, Mr Sharp firmly believes that
practically all modern, urban crime is linked to drugs. He said
yesterday that by targeting the drugs culture he was confident that this
would impact on other fields of crime.
He also recognised that, as in the earlier, successful exercises,
police officers would have to be diverted away from other duties to
concentrate on Operation Eagle. Every operational officer in Strathclyde
Police, from chief superintendent down, would be involved.
Eagle, Mr Sharp said, was an acronym for education, awareness,
guidance, legislation and enforcement. He acknowledged his debt to the
current Government strategy coming through the Scottish Office and
stemming from Lord Fraser's ministerial drugs task force which had
fostered the idea of drugs action teams based on health board areas.
His force will be represented on each of the Strathclyde teams,
Greater Glasgow, Argyle and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran and Lanarkshire at
detective superintendent level, adding clout to the force's
already-widespread representation at every level in anti-drugs agencies
through local liaison officers.
In the past, the force drugs strategy had been based on the two Es,
education and enforcement. The new strategy recognises that there are
other dimensions.
''We were having to devote more time than we wanted to activities
other and enforcement. We saw our main role as enforcement but we had to
put liaison officers with all the organisations to develop our
strategies. The trouble was it was unco-ordinated. The head of my drug
squad told me they were having to spend more time on this other work
than on enforcement. There was some truth in that and we had to review
it.
''The new strategy is a change from the two Es to a much more complex
situation and the recommendations in that ministerial report are helping
me,'' he said.
The Scottish Office task force report had been a key factor in the
timing of Operation Eagle; much that was positive had come out of it and
money had been made available to make the plans work.
Mr Sharp said that some current strategies were already making an
impact, including needle exchanges and the methadone substitute
prescribing programme. There was evidence, he said, from the number of
referrals to some agencies of a drop in injecting behaviour.
He recognised that if these hopeful schemes were to continue working
then he could not abuse them by using them to gather intelligence.
Much of the stimulus for Operation Eagle had come from the 97 known
drug deaths in Strathclyde last year -- 40 to date this year -- and
these deaths were only those which they knew about directly.
There were probably many more, he conceded, as well as a horrific
catalogue of illnesses and amputations associated with drug abuse.
In the first phase of Eagle, the police intend to bring together all
the projects to tackle drug abuse. The force's education programme is to
be revamped. Mr Sharp said not all policemen knew how to talk to
children in the classroom. The education department and teachers had
come in with the plans wholeheartedly, he said.
He outlined a range of diversionary schemes -- what he called the Pied
Piper approach -- aimed at taking young people away from the street
corners where they were prey for the drug pushers.
Many of the plans include sport, including local football leagues, and
to give this ''oomph'', he said, they hoped to arrange a final at Ibrox,
Celtic Park or Hampden.
Mr Sharp said he intended to supply the media with the anti-drugs
message, with radio programmes, newspaper coverage, and television. One
seminar was being arranged for 6000 children. The SFA had weighed in to
provide football coaching. There was even to be a highland games for
children.
For parents, drugs identification guides would be produced.
One computer programme for ''clued-up kids'' would get the message to
1500 pupils next month about drugs use and sharing of needles.
At the close of the first 90 days there would be a two-week period
when people could empty their bathroom cabinet of unwanted drugs into
bins at police stations. It was not an amnesty, he said, because the
word amnesty smacked of a weakening of resolve.
''I want to give the public an opportunity to show that they are with
us and say that they mean business as well. We will then see what we
get,'' he stated.
He welcomed in this respect the Government intention to reschedule
Temazepam, the biggest drug of abuse in Strathclyde, which would he
hoped stop repeat prescriptions of the drug as well as the
over-prescribing which they knew went on.
''Temazepam is in great supply, I am looking for the promised
readjustments in the law to stop it falling into the wrong hands.'' he
added.
The enforcement period would be very high profile and very intensive.
He had already alerted everyone in the force with a personal message as
to what he expected of them.
That message is contained in a force video in which Mr Sharp says:
''We will use every means at our disposal, both overt and covert
policing.
''We are determined to turn the tide against those who profit from the
obscene trade in drugs.''
The Crimestoppers numbers, manned 24 hours, would play an important
part.
''Tell us who is doing it,'' he urged. ''Tell us where they are doing
it.''
He knew that the strategies he had outlined were not a final solution,
he said, nor were they intended to be. The drug action teams created by
the Government plan would be their eyes and ears on the ground and his
force would be fully supporting the teams.
''This is a kick start to the work of the drugs action teams. It will
provide some lead to some of the agencies out there who are doing such
good work. It will show our commitment, that we mean business and we
will do business with them,'' he stated.
In a reference to the current operation tackling the outburst of
drug-related violence in Renfrewshire, he added: ''I hope that the
enforcement phase will show the dealers that what we have done in
Paisley is not a flash in the pan.''
He recognised that when they locked one dealer up there was another
behind him. The other parts of the criminal justice system, including
the courts, also had to show that they meant business.
''Operation Eagle is an operation without a beginning, a middle or an
end. We will be targeting the lot, including cannabis,'' he said.
There would be no direct cost for Operation Eagle although it would
divert police officers from other tasks.
Mr Sharp refused to be drawn into criticism of the courts when
questioned about the statement on the rest of the criminal justice
system playing its part.
''I am saying that the courts have very wide ranging powers available
to them including life imprisonment for certain drugs offences. I am
just looking for them to use their powers to the full. I believe there
is scope for improvement.''
Meanwhile, Mr Sharp was dismissive of claims made in a tabloid
newspaper that crack -- a cocaine derivitive -- was being made in
Glasgow. The composition of the sample produced by the newspaper, .34 of
a gramme of cocaine of 10% purity, indicated that it was for personal
use.
However, he said police were aware that there were ''people south of
Hadrian's Wall with Scottish connections'' who were experimenting and
dabbling in crack cocaine'', presumably exploring the possibility of
opening up markets in Scotland.
The amount of cocaine coming into Scotland was increasing. If cocaine
was here, he believed, there would be someone trying to convert it into
crack, but there was no reason to suppose that there was any large-scale
manufacture going on here.

THE drug action teams envisaged by Lord Fraser as part of a package
backed by #8.8m of Government money are coming into being in
Strathclyde, with four teams centred on the Greater Glasgow Health Board
divisions.
The Rev Roderick Campbell, deputy chairman of GGHB, was at the launch
of Operation Eagle launch and outlined the philosophy behind the teams.
The idea is to bring together all the many statutory and voluntary
agencies working with drug users.
''We have everyone involved -- social work, education, police, prisons
and the voluntary sector. Over recent months we have begun to get them
working together.
''Operation Eagle is an excellent starting point and we welcome this.
We are absolutely clear that the future is going to be the co-operation
of agencies. Lessons from Eagle will come back to the drug action teams
to guide future development.''
Mr Campbell was pleased by Mr Sharp's reference to targeting cannabis
as the truth about the harm it caused, including its carcinogenetic
properties, was now emerging from research in America.

THE chance has arisen to join a remote band of Scottish landowners --
the island hermit.
According to a new Scottish Office census, Scotland has six islands
where the single residents subscribe to the Oscar Wilde school of
thought on housing. Wilde it was who noted: ''Other people are quite
dreadful. The only possible society is oneself.''
The opportunity to adhere to Mr Wilde's aphorism and become Scotland's
seventh island hermit -- in addition to the misanthropes of the islands
of Dry, Isle Martin, Danna, Shona, Torsa, and Valla -- has cropped up
with the marketing of the tiny isle of Texa which lies a third of a mile
off the southern coast of Islay.
It would seem that Texa's remoteness has not put off potential buyers.
Far from it. According to selling agents Savills of Edinburgh, there has
been a healthy interest from the UK for the island, which has just gone
on the market. ''As the weeks unfold, we would expect interest from
round the world,'' a spokesman said.
It is a far historical cry from the days of yore. One of its past
residents, Andrew Knox, the Bishop of the Isles, got so fed up whiling
away his time among the heather, wild goats, otters, and seals that he
wrote to James VI and I pleading to be allowed to retire.
Bishop Knox said the hardship entailed in reaching Texa was turning
him into an old man before his time. He wrote to the King: ''Ould aige
dayle crepis on and be thir tubilsum jurney is now semis to make gritter
haist nor of befoir.''
Obviously, Bishop Knox was unable to take advantage of the nearby
delights offered by the Laphroaig distillery, which nowadays lies less
than a mile away on Islay, or the modernised cottage which Texa boasts
today.
Although it is just 70 miles as the crow flies from Glasgow, reaching
Texa is an arduous affair even in this day and age, and involves a
ferry, a taxi and a helpful fisherman for the last leg of the journey.
However, the well-heeled can always fly to Islay. Even then they still
need the obliging fisherman.
The first historical reference to Texa was made in the sixth century
with the publication of Adomnan's Life of St Columba. When St Kenneth
met St Columba on nearby Iona, he lost his pastoral staff.
Legend has it that Columba eventually found the staff and threw it
into the sea, having prayed that it would be returned somehow to St
Kenneth. It was washed up on Texa's beach, where Kenneth stumbled on it
while returning to Ireland.
The 141-acre island, which is barely a mile long, is on sale at offers
over #80,000 -- less than the price of a three-bedroomed flat in
Glasgow's West End, or two broom cupboards in London.
Should even a hermit get too lonely, he or she will have the company
of 10 feral goats.

VICTIMS of a lethal form of leukemia are being given a new lease of
life by a drug which mimics the body's defence against infection.
An Edinburgh-based trial of the drug Interferon Alpha has shown that
survival for chronic myeloid leukemia from the time of diagnosis is
almost doubled.
The eight-year trial, comparing nearly 300 patients from all over
Britain receiving Interferon with a similar number getting the standard
treatment, proved so successful it has been brought to an end, the
Lancet reports today.
Although conventional cytotoxic drugs are still given at the outset,
and used as a back-up, maintenance Interferon has become an automatic
choice, giving patients on average two extra years of life.
More than 500 new cases are reported each year in Britain. The study,
based at the MRC Human Genetics Unit at the Western General Hospital,
found that more than half (52%) of those who received the Wellferon
preparation survived at least five years, whereas only a third (34%) of
those on standard treatment survived that long.
Dr Norman Allan, co-ordinator of the trial, said yesterday: ''Since we
have established that it is of such benefit it has become widely used --
it is one of the first-line treatments of this disease.''
The treatment is applied during the chronic phase of the disease,
which can last up to three years before the rapid and normally fatal
acute phase.
Dr Allan admitted: ''It is not the most pleasant of treatments. It is
the substance produced by the body to fight off infections like the flu,
which is what makes you feel bad. So getting Interferon makes you feel
like you've got flu.''
He said that lasts about 10 days. ''The trade-off is the extension of
life it provides: the lifespan from diagnosis is almost doubled, from
three years to five.''
Another drawback is the expense: a course of treatment can cost from
#5000 to #15,000 for each patient. However, the trial has shown that
lower doses are necessary than was first thought.
The MRC unit is to begin another trial comparing various dose levels
to establish the minimum effective levels.
Most sufferers have an abnormality known as Philadelphia chromosome,
in which the chromosomes are joined together.
What has excited doctors about the latest trial is that in many of the
patients treated with Interferon, the cells carrying this abnormality
were reduced to ''vanishingly small'' numbers.
''This had never been achieved before, and we began to wonder if we
had a cure,'' said Dr Allan. That proved not be the case -- there is
always a residual level of the cells -- but the reduction was a pointer
to better survival.
''When Interferon came out physicians were giving up because they
weren't getting a reduction in Philadelphia cell count -- we are saying
there is still a benefit in survival for these patients,'' he said.
''It has really cause a stir round the world. We have been treating
this disease since 1900 and the outlook hadn't changed much until now.''
Dr Allan explained that intensive treatments, in which the bone marrow
is removed to protect it and then replaced, had also had good effects in
some cases. By combining this benefit with that from human alpha
Interferon therapy, even better results might be obtained. A trial to
find out if this hope was justified was now being planned at London's
Hammersmith Hospital.

EALING Studios, where many of Britain's classic films were made, has
been rescued from receivership.
It was sold yesterday to the National Film and Television School for
more than #2m, put up by the Foundation for Sports and the Arts, which
receives money from the football pools.
In a complex two-stage deal, the BBC, which sold the studios in 1992,
bought them back from the receiver and then sold them ''for a price in
excess of #2m'' to the NFTS.
The deal allowed the BBC's television film services department to
retain its base at the studios and BBC programme makers to use the
facilities at commercial rates.

MORE than 5000 people turned out to watch rock star Rod Stewart play
in a charity football match in Glasgow last night.
The match -- between Stewart's team, the LA Exiles, and a team of
football celebrities -- was in aid of the British Brain and Spine
Foundation.
It was arranged following the tragic death of Davie Cooper, the
Scottish international footballer who died of a brain haemorrhage in
March. Stewart and Cooper were friends.
Before the kick-off at Newlandsfield Park, Rod Stewart thanked the
fans for coming along to support a worthy cause and praised Cooper as a
''great player and a good lad''.
The celebrity team included Terry Butcher, Rangers' manager Walter
Smith, former Celtic winger Jimmy Johnstone, and ex-Aberdeen and
Manchester United star Martin Buchan, pictured here with Stewart.
The LA Exiles, a team of British expatriates who have been together
for 10 years, are due to play another celebrity match at Woodford
Football Club on Tuesday. Rod Stewart and his band begin a UK tour in
Aberdeen next Thursday.

CRIME detection rates in Scotland have risen by 5% over the last year,
according to the latest report by HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for
Scotland, Mr John Boyd.
The third significant annual increase confirms a report on record
clear-up rates published by The Herald last April.
In his report, issued yesterday, Mr Boyd said the number of crimes
successfully investigated totalled 195,745 in 1994, compared with
186,212 in the previous year. This represented the biggest clear-up rate
for crimes since 1987.
''The recent patterns have been encouraging but police forces should
not be complacent,'' Mr Boyd said.
He commended the ''positive way'' in which Scotland's eight police
forces were tackling the demands placed upon them.
''The pursuit of high-quality management and service delivery is
leading to a continuous cycle of improvement and the service has
developed a high degree of integration and co-operation with the diverse
range of social agencies dedicated to improving the quality of life in
Scotland.
''The police need the public, just as much as the public need the
police.''
Mr Boyd identified problems facing society: ''I know that the
pernicious effect of drugs, on our young people in particular, and its
impact on crime greatly concerns Ministers and chief constables.
''The number and range of initiatives to combat these negative effects
is testimony to the determination of society to have a positive
influence on the issues.
''During the year, the widely publicised deaths from drug abuse were
extremely regrettable and emphasise the need for the twin objectives of
education and enforcement to combat this menace to society.''
Successful police activity, said Mr Boyd, had led to a 14% increase in
recorded cases from 4943 in 1993, to 5625 last year.
With new challenges for forces under reorganisation of local
government, Mr Boyd said there would be a number of issues to be faced,
in which an informed and considered approach would be required, within
limited budgets.
During 1994, 1654 complaint cases were made against the police, which
represented a decrease of 10.2% compared to the previous year.
Mr Boyd said that while complaints against police officers always
concerned him, it was the second successive drop.
He pointed out that in one region -- Grampian -- 46,170 offences had
been recorded, which did not compare well with detection rates in other
areas.
Later, Chief Constable Ian Oliver said: ''It should be understood that
Scottish forces currently use differing methods of recording reported
crimes. Grampian Police is as effective and efficient as any other
force.''

<HEADLINE>Council helps island hunt for buried saint</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE search for an early Scottish saint, believed to be enshrined on an
island in the Firth of Forth, is to be stepped up.
The archaeological dig on the Isle of May this summer will attempt to
find clues to confirm that one of the early Christian burials on the
island could be that of St Adrian or Ethernan, who was reputedly
murdered by Vikings in 875.
The work, co-ordinated and led by Fife Regional Council, is managed in
conjunction with Scottish Natural Heritage which owns the island. The
project is supported by North East Fife District Council and other
funders.
Fife region's planning and environment committee has welcomed a report
on the success of the project, which has been running since 1992, and
approved an additional #10,000 to assist with the excavation programme
for 1995/96.
Since work began, the survey, excavation, and interpretations have
cost #64,000, of which #18,000 has been provided by the council.
The work aims to provide access to the site for visitors and to reveal
the features of the first medieval monastery to be uncovered in
Scotland.
During the digs, an archaeologist meets each boat from Anstruther and
takes visitors on a tour of the site.
So far, the excavation has revealed part of an ancient monastery site
and a burial ground. It is hoped that evidence of pre-twelfth century
Christian occupation of the island will also be uncovered.
''This is a fascinating project which has already attracted thousands
of visitors to the Isle of May,'' said Councillor Alex Sharp, committee
chairman.
He said a monument would be erected when work was finished.
A video and display describing a trip to the island can be seen at the
Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther.

<HEADLINE>#50m Loch Lomond visitor centre will create 2500 jobs</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978092320</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A #50m investment creating 2500 jobs over five years was announced for
Loch Lomondside yesterday.
The Bonnie Banks will benefit from a huge cash injection to create a
visitor centre at Drumkinnon Bay in Balloch village.
Mr David Pearson, director of enterprise development for
Dunbartonshire Enterprise, which recently purchased a parcel of land for
#2.6m from Drumkinnon Development Company, said: ''Our objective is to
secure for Dumbarton district a potential world-class visitor
destination.''
Drumkinnon Bay Company was owned by Cala Homes Ltd, of Edinburgh, and
Dixons, the photographic and electrical equipment dealers.
Its chairman was former Celtic FC director Dr Michael Kelly, a former
Lord Provost of Glasgow.
Scottish Woollen Mills, which is owned by Scottish entrepreneur David
Stevenson and proprietor of Antartex Village in nearby Alexandria, is
believed to be one of the companies poised to make a large investment in
the Balloch visitor centre.
Mr Pearson said: ''Over the five years to the year 2000, we will have
investment of #50m at Drumkinnon Bay.
''We are looking at the creation of 2000 to 2500 jobs here. The
spin-off to tourist-related business in the area will be very
significant indeed.
''The strategy is to persuade visitors into Dumbarton district to
enjoy a major attraction at Balloch, and to encourage them to stay and
enjoy other places of interest like Dumbarton Castle, the Bonnie Banks
themselves, Hill House at Helensburgh, and the conservation park on
Rosneath Peninsula.''
More than five million people take the High Road along Loch Lomondside
every year but fewer than 5% stop in the area.
Mr Pearson was speaking at the Dumbarton District Business Club
Business of the Year lunch, sponsored by Allied Distillers Ltd.
The award was won by Lomond Castle Lodges, a business being built up
on the ashes of the former Lomond Castle Hotel at Arden, which was
burned down by a businessman in a #3m insurance fraud plot.
Mr Donald Wilkie who, with his wife Elaine, owns Lomond Castle Lodges,
said: ''It's a great honour for us to receive this so early into our
development of the Lomond Castle site. It's a great boost for our
business.''
* Up to 2000 jobs are to be created with the development of a #100m
World Trade Centre in Bristol, it was announced yesterday.
Work is expected to start on the project by the end of the year and it
is hoped its doors will open in 1998.
It will comprise a tourism centre, conference rooms, and finance and
education offices. There will also be hotel accommodation and around
30,000sq ft of exhibition space. The new jobs will be mostly in the
service sector.

TWO men were last night charged in connection with the death of
schoolboy Daniel Handley, Scotland Yard said.
The two, identified only as Man A and Man B, will appear before
magistrates, in London today.
Man A has been charged with Daniel's murder on or before March 27 this
year. Man B has been charged with assisting him to evade police.
Nine-year-old Daniel disappeared from his home in Beckton, east
London, in October last year. His body was found on waste ground near
Bristol in March.
His remains were discovered in a shallow grave on the waste ground
near Bradley Stoke, on the northern outskirts of Bristol.
The body was found by a man walking his dog near the Woodlands golf
and country club on the edge of the Bradley Stoke estate -- one of the
largest private housing developments in England.
Hundreds of homes there were visited in house-to-house inquiries as
part of the investigation.
Police also carried out raids on minicab offices at Camberwell and
Rotherhithe in south London.
They said they were ''acting on information received''. Officers also
carried out raids in the Bradley Stoke area.

A BIZARRE stand-off involving four public bodies and the crew of the
Rothesay ferry means islanders suffering medical emergencies are being
taken off Bute by military helicopter.
It emerged yesterday that, for the past two weeks, Caledonian
MacBrayne has been unable to provide its traditional out-of-hours
service taking ambulances to the mainland via Wemyss Bay or Gourock when
Bute's Victoria Hospital cannot cope.
As a result, the National Health Service has been forced to call on
the armed forces to transport urgent medical cases, even though it costs
around three times as much and is less comfortable for patients.
Already one invalid has travelled by a Sea King helicopter from HMS
Gannet at Prestwick. If it is unavailable, an aircraft will be sought
from another base elsewhere in Scotland.
Ultimate responsibility for the problem was being denied by most of
the main participants.
The intractable nature of the stand-off is reflected in its complex
background. For decades, the Rothesay crew and pier staff have agreed to
run the ferry in cases of emergency; they are paid but are not legally
obliged to turn out.
Now, disenchanted by a rising number of call-outs eating into their
leisure hours, and restricted by new Department of Transport regulations
which demand longer breaks between shifts, they are refusing to
guarantee attendance.
One worker said last night: ''We are fed up being piggy-in-the-middle
in this situation. There were 54 call-outs last year and the money spent
on the ferry service could be used to pay for a consultant on Bute.''
CalMac admits it has an undertaking with the Scottish Office to
provide the service but says it cannot compel the staff to run the ferry
in their own time.
Personnel manager Ian Russell said: ''We have no solution to this. It
is basically up to the goodwill of the men whether the ferries sail.
They feel their social time is increasingly being impinged upon.
''The safety of the ship's crew and passengers on the morning after a
call-out is of paramount importance. We don't want our staff walking
about like zombies in charge of vessels after having been called out in
the early hours of the morning to attend a medical emergency.''
The various bodies involved in purchasing and running the ambulance
operation -- Argyll and Clyde Health Board, Argyll and Bute NHS Trust,
and the Scottish Ambulance Service -- claim the problem is an internal
one for CalMac.
The health board has hinted that it might seek another ferry operator
if the impasse remains unbroken.
Meanwhile, the Western Isles MP, Mr Calum Macdonald, yesterday wrote
to the National Audit Office asking it to investigate the Government's
refusal to publish a consultants' report which advised against the
privatisation of CalMac.
The report is understood to conclude that privatising CalMac would
make no economic or social sense.
Mr Macdonald told the Audit Office: ''I believe that a report costing
over #130,000, paid for by public money, and concerning a publicly owned
company, should be made available to the public. The Government's
refusal to publish even a summary makes it impossible for MPs to hold
the Government properly to account or to ascertain whether the public is
getting value for money from such reports.''

Dublin
THE Prince of Wales has charmed his way into the affections of the
Irish people. His phenomenally successful two-day visit to the Irish
Republic has helped consolidate the peace process in Northern Ireland
and has brought diplomatic relations between London and Dublin to an
all-time diplomatic high.
Not even an egg-throwing incident involving republican protesters
could spoil a trip which has received lavish praise in the Irish
newspapers.
Prince Charles, used to bad publicity in the London tabloids, has
received media attention on a scale similar to what Pope John Paul II
would expect in Ireland.
Crowds turned out at various venues in Dublin yesterday to greet a
smiling Prince, clearly elated at the reception given to him on his
first visit to the republic. His busy schedule included lunch with
President Mary Robinson. But earlier he went out of his way to meet
ordinary Dubliners.
The royal day began at 10am in the Mansion House, where Lord Mayor
John Gormley and the city councillors hosted a civic reception in his
honour. Prince Charles was presented with a Waterford glass bowl.
He signed the visitors' book as ''Charles, June 1.''
The Lord Mayor described the visit as ''undoubtedly the most symbolic
and important royal visit ever to our city and country.''
After the reception, Prince Charles unveiled a restored portrait of
King George IV by Sir Thomas Lawrence.
The Prince charmed the audience when he refused to talk Irish without
the aid of a stiff whiskey.
''I won't, if you don't mind, try to say anything in Irish,'' he said.
''Every time I try and say something in Gaelic or Welsh, it is very
important to have a very, very large glass of whisky beforehand.''
On leaving the Mansion House, Prince Charles made an unscheduled
walk-about. While some republicans jeered him and waved banners with the
slogan ''Remember Bloody Sunday,'' others, mainly women, cheered him.
One woman praised him for his courage in coming to Ireland. ''I said to
the Prince that he was very brave,'' she said.
But the more ugly incident came later after Prince Charles had opened
the new British Tourist Authority office in Dame Street. The eggs were
fired as the Prince, accompanied by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring,
made their way towards the crowd where the anti-royalists were at their
most vocal.
At least four eggs were thrown, but missed the Prince. One of them
struck a woman in the crowd who had just been speaking with him.
Police arrested at least three people.
After lunch at the residence of President Robinson, Prince Charles
spent his time on tourist visits to the megalithic tomb at Newgrange in
County Meath. His last official function was a visit to Butterstream
Gardens, also in County Meath.
Last night, Prince Charles began an extended private stay and was
believed to be in South Mayo on a fishing trip. Among his luggage were
fishing rods, and an artist's easel and sketching folder.
Irish Government officials have drawn up a positive balance sheet on
the first public royal visit to Ireland since the partition of the
island in 1922.
From a social point of view, the Prince found an almost adulatory
response from middle-aged and elderly women. One of the highlights that
will enter Dublin folklore was when the Prince entered a senior
citizens' centre, where he was greeted to the tune For He's a Jolly Good
Fellow. The Prince accepted the obligatory glass of Guinness before
reminding everyone that he hopes to make a return visit.
Editorially, the Irish newspapers have praised the Prince for striking
the right note about the dramatic improvement in British-Irish relations
and the importance of the peace process as the catalyst, despite the
minority group of protesters.
* Speculation mounted in Dublin that the Queen could soon make a state
visit to the republic. Government sources disclosed the success of the
Prince's ground-breaking visit could herald a formal state visit within
two years.
Mrs Robinson, who visited Buckingham Palace in 1993, has made no
secret of her wish for the Queen to visit Ireland before 1997, when Mrs
Robinson leaves office.
Buckingham Palace said there were ''no plans at present'' for a state
visit.

<TEXT>
TWO 12-year-old girls returning from a picnic were stripped, tied to a
tree, and raped by a masked man.
The rapist, wielding a knife, allegedly attacked the schoolgirls near
a reservoir at Oldham, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday afternoon.
An 18-year-old local man, arrested near the scene, was being
questioned about the attack yesterday. He was released without charge, a
Greater Manchester Police spokesman said last night.
''This was a brutal, horrific attack on two very respectable young
girls who had been enjoying a picnic together,'' said Detective Chief
Inspector Geoff Isaacs, leading the hunt. ''They are very distressed and
being comforted by relatives.''
The attack took place as the girls were on their way home, pushing
their bicycles.
''He threatened to kill them, forced them to strip and tied them to a
tree using their shoelaces,'' added Mr Isaacs. ''Later he calmly walked
away, taking all the girls' clothes, which were found hidden in a nearby
culvert. The two girls were hysterical but managed to free themselves.''
They were found, shocked and dazed, by two women out walking. The
women took them to the nearest house, about 200 yards away, where the
alarm was raised.
They were being interviewed on videotape about their ordeal by
specially trained police officers yesterday.
The attack took place near Waterworks Road, Waterhead. ''This is an
isolated area which is used as a picnic area,'' added Mr Isaacs. The man
appeared in front of the girls, holding a red-handled knife. He was
wearing a balaclava with eye and mouth-holes.
''He told them to get down the path or he would kill them. Then he
pushed their cycles into some bushes and forced them to a grassy area
behind.''
The rapist was described as between 16 and 18, between 5ft 8in and 5ft
10in. He was white with a chubby face and build, with badly bitten
fingernails.
He was wearing a black zip-up jacket with a zip pocket on the sleeve.
There was orange colouring inside the zip. The man was also wearing
shiny blue-grey jogging bottoms and blue and white trainers.
On Thursday of last week another 12-year-old girl was raped by a
teenager as she cycled near the Leeds-Liverpool canal at Ince Moss,
Wigan, Greater Manchester -- 25 miles away from the Oldham attack.
''We are liaising with detectives on the Wigan inquiry, but we are not
linking the two incidents at this stage,'' said Mr Isaacs.

THE owner of a plastics factory planned to scare away burglars by
planting ''land mines'' in his garden.
However, Mr Joe Reeve was forced to admit yesterday after inquiries
from anxious neighbours that the devices were harmless.
His plan was to give thieves the fright of their lives after a spate
of break-ins at houses in the village of Church Enstone, Oxfordshire.
But now the secret is out -- they are just small fireworks operated by
a trip-wire.
Mr Reeve, 51, said: ''They will not hurt anyone. They'll simply let
off a loud bang.
''I have every right to protect my property by all reasonable means.
I'm a keen shotgun enthusiast and read about the non-lethal mines in a
magazine.
''The crime situation in this village has become quite ludicrous. The
last straw came when they smashed into my BMW despite the #1000 alarm
and took a #1200 radio.''
Mr Reeve was warned by police he could face prosecution if anyone
suffered injury from his booby traps.
Sergeant John Eades of Chipping Norton police said: ''We can
understand his frustration but he must be careful not to put himself in
a position where he may injure someone.
''There have been a large number of incidents in the area and a
village like Enstone is obviously not used to this sort of thing.''

THE head of the best-known Scottish family in America, Mr Malcolm S
Forbes Jr, revealed to The Herald last night his ambition to be the next
President of the United States.
The final decision will be taken later this month but Mr Forbes, the
47-year-old billionaire publisher confirmed in an exclusive interview he
is already putting an organisation into place, with a view to winning
the Republican ticket in next year's election.
At the Forbes Building on Fifth Avenue, New York, Steve Forbes, as he
is known, explained his motive: ''Friends have asked me to give the
matter serious consideration and I have decided to do so, partly because
I am dissatisfied with the other candidates.''
He believed they were not ''emphasising an economic growth agenda . .
. they are getting too fixed on domestic issues and paying no attention
to the international scene which may affect those domestic issues in the
future.''
Mr Forbes, who came back to Scotland three years ago to be president
of the Royal Highland Show, succeeded to the family publishing and
property empire in 1990 on the death of his father. Mr Malcolm Forbes
was himself tipped for the White House in the 1950s. However, he
misjudged his bid for the Governorship of New Jersey and later joked he
had been ''edged out by a landslide''.
He had succeeded his own father, Mr Bertie Forbes, from Whitehill of
New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who went to America in 1904, and founded the
Forbes empire in 1917.
Mr Steve Forbes said he had put up the starting millions for his
campaign but had no intention of financing an ego-trip in the manner of
Ross Perot at the last election. He would seek to raise the rest of the
money elsewhere, not merely as a means of proceeding but as a barometer
of what national support he might expect.
''The nominating process would cost from $18m to $25m and going all
the way to the White House would add another $50m,'' he explained.
Like his father a graduate of Princeton, where he started the magazine
Business Today, he has the customary 51% control of the family empire.
In 1972, he married Ms Sabina Beekman, daughter of the former rector of
St Paul's American Episcopal Church in Rome. They have five daughters.
The Forbes empire encompasses a London home at Old Battersea House, a
French chateau at Balleroy, a palace in Tangiers, the Highlander yacht,
and a Boeing 727.
The family head must now decide whether Scottish determination could
be enough to enable him to include the White House in the list.

AN illness which has baflled
teams of experts for three years may now force the closure and
demolition of a small school in Ayrshire.
Even visitors to Craigpark School in North Ayr, built in 1980 to cater
for children with profound learning difficulties, have felt their
throats tightening and eyes water when they entered the building.
Strathclyde region carried out an investigation three years ago after
staff and pupils began to complain of dizziness, headaches, and skin
irritation.
The department of architecture and related services conducted
extensive tests on the site, the fabric of the school building and its
contents, drainage systems, wall insulation, and soil.
All tests proved negative, as did further tests carried out by experts
from Dundee University.
As the school has twice been decanted to other accommodation during
repeated investigations with no improvement achieved, it is now proposed
that the 19 Craigpark pupils be relocated permanently three miles away
at Southpark and Rosebank schools for pupils with special educational
needs.
As well as losing a relatively new building, the financial cost of the
investigation, adaptations, and improvements carried out, including the
installation of a new ventilation system, has totalled #120,000.
Mr David Alexander, Strathclyde's depute director of education, said:
''There have been complaints about staff and pupils generally feeling
unwell -- eyes smarting, throat and chest infections, rashes, and so on.
''There have been many tests done. The regional chemist has been
called in many times. The council's architects and outside consultants
have been involved, and nothing has been found.''
He disclosed that a recently-retired depute director of education had
gone into the building in sceptical mood. He had emerged complaining of
a tightness in his throat and a watering eyes.
Mr Alexander commented: ''The problem was described in the
consultants' report as 'a non-sensible pollutant', which I understand is
a technical term for saying there is something there they couldn't find.
It really is a total mystery.''
Mr Thomas Farrell, education chairman, said: ''It's some kind of sick
building syndrome. We've tried everything we know to cure it but nothing
seems to have worked. Even some of the technical experts called in to
advise us have felt unwell after being in the building.
The education department will now seek the views of the parents over
the suggested closure. However, the department is taking the firm line
that the building should be closed and demolished in the interests of
the health of both children and staff.

Washington, Thursday
AN American attempt to broker a peace settlement for Bosnia collapsed
suddenly this evening when the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic refused
the deal proposed to him. Sources here say he was offered a lifting of
sanctions in exchange for recognising the Bosnian government and
obtaining the release of UN hostages.
An American official, Mr Robert Frasure, a deputy assistant secretary
of state, met Mr Milosevic in secret in a hunting lodge near Belgrade.
The terms he offered had been approved by the other members of the
contact group of nations, Britain, France, Russia, and Germany, meeting
in Brussels. The Bosnian government objected strongly. It said Milosevic
was being offered far too much for a negligible return.
The sanctions against Serbia would have been suspended: oil deliveries
would have been guaranteed on a monthly basis, and the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund would have been urged to provide credits to
help revive Yugoslavia's economy.
Furthermore, the president of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, agreed that the
Serbian areas of Croatia, which have broken away and proclaimed
themselves The Republic of Krajina, would be granted a large measure of
autonomy.
Mr Milosevic rejected the proposal. The sticking point was his
insistence that sanctions could only be restored by a vote of the
Security Council. He believed he could count on a Russian or Chinese
veto, whatever Yugoslavia did in the meantime.
The Americans, on behalf of the contact group, refused this last
concession. The threat of reimposing sanctions was the only leverage
that would be left.
It was a great blow to President Clinton's diplomacy. He had expected
that a deal was in the offing, which would have won the release of the
UN hostages and set the stage for a permanent settlement.

THE Prime Minister found himself at the centre of another row last
night after he placed the blame for the ''fed up'' factor on the boom
and bust years of the housing market.
Opposition parties combined with charities, mortgage lenders, and even
his own back bench to accuse him of mounting a direct attack on home
owners.
They pointed out that Mr Major was a finance Minister at the Treasury
for much of the period of the late 1980s housing boom, widely agreed to
have been generated by easy borrowing and Government tax changes.
The row unfolded at an unfortunate moment: City experts predicted a
small monthly drop in average house prices recorded by the Nationwide
Building Society yesterday was the ''calm before the storm'' of
large-scale further reductions.
Mr Major had told businessmen in Lincoln that the white-collar
recession had arisen after people invested heavily in housing. ''I
recall the rather crazy situation existing towards the end of the 1980s
with no immediately apparent way of stopping it,'' he said.
''House prices went spiralling upwards and it was always likely that
was going to stop at some stage. It did, but by the time it stopped an
awful lot of people had committed themselves to mortgages that were a
good deal bigger than ideally they should have had.
''Suddenly inflation began to take off, interest rates began to rise,
mortgage rates began to rise and house prices stopped rising and fell.
The negative equity trap that has done so much damage to confidence
began to hit us.''
The Prime Minister sought to argue that economic circumstances now
were the best for a long time, and that it looked as though Britain was
heading for ''a classic economic recovery''.
However, his remarks on mortgages were seized on by opposition parties
and housing organisations and managed to alienate elements within his
own party. One senior back bencher criticised the record of Lord Lawson
when he was Chancellor between 1983 and 1989, stating: ''I don't think
there is any doubt that some of Nigel Lawson's policies fuelled the
housing boom.
''Undoubtedly Nigel Lawson made a number of mistakes. He tried to
shadow the Deutschmark and he let house prices rip, and we certainly
paid the price for it.''
Mr Major, Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1987 to 1989, ''seemed
to have forgotten his own role in that,'' he added.
More predictably Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said the comments were
a direct attack on home owners. He said Mr Major appeared to be holding
them responsible for taking his own advice.
Mr Brown said: ''Mr Major is blaming everyone but himself for the
mistakes that have caused so much economic hardship to home owners and
others. This is a direct attack on Mrs Thatcher's Government, in which
he was an economic Minister. Given that his advice was wrong in the
1980s, why should anyone take his advice now?''
For the Liberal Democrats, Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said: ''Mr
Major's criticisms of the policies of boom and bust are pretty rich
coming from a man who, as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and then as
Chancellor, played a very full part in stoking up the fires of excess
and speculative fever. People will be disgusted to see Mr Major trying
to dodge responsibility for his own actions and attempting to rewrite
history.''
The charity for the homeless, Shelter, condemned Mr Major's comments
as ''ill-informed''. Ms Louise Casey, director of housing services,
said: ''The fact is that the Government is largely responsible for the
present mess that many of Britain's homeowners are in.
''Policies such as the right-to-buy and the deregulation of the
private rented sector, which reduced social housing stock and increased
private rents, have meant that for many people there has been no viable
alternative to home ownership.
''The Government should once and for all face the fact that they
wholeheartedly encouraged home ownership and have now left hundreds of
thousands of home owners with insurmountable mortgage arrears, facing
repossession.''
The Council of Mortgage Lenders said the Prime Minister had failed to
take into account the Government's own role in bringing about the
current situation. A spokesman said: ''The Government itself is at least
partly responsible. There is an implication that lenders are to blame
and we would not accept that.''
In the City, the predictions were that the housing market would suffer
further price reductions.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Midland Global Markets, said:
''Over the summer we can expect further price falls because banks and
building societies are not lending money for mortgages as there are
fewer people out there traipsing the streets looking for houses.''

<HEADLINE>Pilot missing presumed dead after Harrier crashes into sea</HEADLINE>

THE pilot of a Harrier jump jet which crashed into the Irish sea off
the south-west of Scotland was missing presumed dead, an RAF spokesman
in London announced last night.
It is thought that Wing Commander Nicholas John Slater, 45, from Bury
St Edmunds, who was unmarried, did not have time to eject from the #20m
aircraft.
Eyewitnesses said they believed a disaster had been narrowly averted
because the jet had flown ''perilously low'' over a cliff-top caravan
site before ditching into the sea and exploding in a ball of fire about
two miles south of Burrowhead, near Whithorn, in Dumfries and Galloway.
A spokesperson at the caravan site said: ''The jets normally come over
low here but this was even lower. It shook the whole building and
everyone got a fright.
''We were lucky it didn't come down here or it could have been a
disaster. Several people saw the jet coming over and then plunging into
the sea.''
Last night, the search for the pilot -- involving two helicopters,
five lifeboats, and two fishing boats -- was wound down, although
coastguard officials and RAF personnel from Valley in Wales continued
coastal searches.
A spokesman at the RAF rescue and co-ordination centre at Pitreavie
said a Royal Navy vessel, HMS Brocklesby, was on its way to the scene to
salvage the aircraft.
Yesterday, debris from the Harrier -- which was on a routine flight
from its base at the Defence Research Agency at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire
-- including a nose cone and kerosene fuel, were found near the crash
site. Coastguard officers also reported that a helmet and pilot's notes
had been retrieved.
Eyewitnesses said the pilot did not eject.
Police confirmed that an amateur video of the crash had been passed to
them and would be handed to RAF crash investigators.
They were, however, unable to confirm a report that the Harrier GR7
was upside down when it hit the sea.
Some people speculated that the pilot may have given his life to hold
the plane's flight path until he was over water.
They said the pilot came low over the holiday park but held a steady
line before ditching the jet, with the engines still running.
Fisherman Andrew Lochhead said the plane flew low over the coast and
then exploded in a ball of fire.
''There was a huge explosion. I heard two jets coming over and then
one just seemed to crash into the sea,'' he said. ''I picked up some
wreckage and then found the helmet. I don't think the pilot would have
stood a chance.
Mr Brian Dixon, from Newcastle upon Tyne, was fishing on the shore and
saw the plane go overhead. ''You could tell it was going to hit the sea.
It went in a straight line downwards and there was a big black ball of
smoke as it hit the water.''
Mr Peter Simpson, of Cutcloy Farm, near Whithorn, Wigtownshire, said
he was in a field when he saw the plane going around fairly low. He
thought something was wrong when he saw it circle twice.
''I then saw a pall of smoke and went back to the house and telephoned
the coastguard,'' he said.
A spokesman at Boscombe Down said the Harrier GR7 -- a vertical
take-off ground-attack plane -- had left on a routine flight from the
military airfield with just the pilot on board.
The alarm had been raised just before 11am by members of the public
and at least one fishing boat skipper who saw the jet crash into the
sea.
An RAF spokesman in London said there had been no record of a Mayday
message before the crash.
He said it appeared the pilot had not ejected from the aircraft
because no signal had been received from radio bleepers which would have
been attached to his lifebelt.
