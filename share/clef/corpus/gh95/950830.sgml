Ross Finlay drives a Japanese saloon that has lots of prestige
WHILE Japanese executive saloons obviously have a place on their home
market, and several of them have done well in America, there is a
reluctance here to put them in the same league as their counterparts
from British and European manufacturers.
It is a matter of badge and name as much as anything else, since this
-- together with the expensive GT sector -- is a part of the market
where a certain amount of automotive snobbery seems inevitable.
Nissan came out with its first prestige saloon, the President, in 1965
and kept that model in its range through a couple of design generations.
The company's UK sales have mostly been in small and medium saloons,
estates and coupes, with a few brawny sports cars, but it took a first
serious crack at the executive market with the Maxima, a car which never
quite ''hit the spot''.
The latest top-ranking Nissan saloon is the Maxima's replacement, the
QX. I had met this combination of letters once before, in a Wodehouse
story whose hero observed a group of seemingly demented women saying
''kew'' and ''exe'' to themselves in an uninhibited fashion. In fact,
they were simply taking part in an exercise to tone up the facial
muscles. The exaggerated Q sound exercised the pout function, while the
X sound made them grin ferociously.
Neither pout nor grin seems an appropriate reaction to the QX as a
car, one into which Nissan has poured large quantities of engineering
expertise. There are six different versions of it available. Two use a
three-litre V6 engine as the SE at #21,995 and the SEL which I have been
driving at #24,995. There are also four two-litre types, but in a car of
this general size and type the smaller engine may be a case of
under-egging the pudding.
The extremely compact three-litre V6 power unit, mounted transversely
so as to power the front wheels, and remarkably light in weight, is a
really sophisticated piece of kit. It is a substantially oversquare
unit, featuring 24 valves and four camshafts, and it pushes out 193bhp
as well as a handsome amount and spread of torque.
While the QX is a robust and well-built car, that excellent engine
endows it with notably strong performance for its type. Even when
slightly muffled by the top-class four-speed automatic transmission
which is standard on the SEL, it will romp to 60mph in about 8.5 seconds
and deliver really good mid-range acceleration. The SEL is also
remarkably highly geared, loping along at 30mph for every 1000rpm of
engine speed. That allows it to be a very relaxed motorway cruiser, and
contributes to steady-speed fuel consumption expectations such as 39mpg
at 56mph and 31 at 75, compared with something like 22mpg around town.
Nissan has given this model a new and fairly complex rear suspension,
which favours what is, for a Japanese car, the unexpected side of the
ride/handling balance. The QX has fine body control on corners, although
it is no sports saloon, but the suspension struggles to suppress the
effect of small bumps or undulating surfaces at modest speeds.
A major plus point for the QX is that it is a roomy saloon, with loads
of space in the rear cabin and also a generous boot. Equipment levels
are high -- from air-conditioning to leather upholstery on seats which,
in the front at least, seem a little too wide. Nissan has made
absolutely certain that no charge of over-embellishment, as in the
earliest Japanese style, could possibly be brought against the QX.
If anything, the interior may be rather austere, in appearance
although certainly not in equipment, for some buyers in this class.
Similarly, the external lines of the body are discreet almost to the
point of anonymity. But this is a technically sophisticated car, well
built and well finished, with all the passenger space its situation in
the executive sector demands.

* The public services union, Unison, has complained about plans by
Borders Regional Council to make its assistant director of social work
redundant.
The council will today discuss a report to make Ms Dianne Savage
redundant with immediate effect.
Mr Mark Irvine of Unison has written to the Local Government Staff
Commission in protest. He claims the council may breach commission
advice by making such a move.
A council spokesman said it would not be commenting on the proposal.

A major step in Hawthorn Housing Co-operative's campaign to improve
housing in East Keppoch, Possilpark, has just been made with the
completion of the first new-build scheme of 29 houses and flats.
A further important step was taken last week when Raymond Robertson,
Minister of Housing, cut the turf on Toffs, a new site which will give
46 new housing units, many of them barrier free, and a much-needed play
area.
The co-operative has also secured funding from Glasgow Development
Agency to decontaminate the old brownfield sites in the area, most of
them formerly occupied by industries connected with the Springburn
railway works.
All the homes in the four terraces at Coulin and Glendarvel have their
own front and back gardens. Eight have two-apartments, four have
three-apartments, and there are three five-apartment homes, while the
remainder have four apartments.
Two have been sold for shared ownership; all the others are being let
at rentals ranging from #125 a month for a two-apartment home to #170 a
month for one with five apartments.
Hawthorn Housing Co-operative developed the scheme with Cruden Estates
Ltd under a design-and-build contract, and they have just heard that it
is to receive a Premier Gas Award.
Chair person Frank Galloway says: ''The new schemes improve housing
opportunities and also improve the environment.
''The bits of the jigsaw still missing in Possilpark are real jobs and
good quality, well-maintained and affordable leisure and recreational
facilities.''
The origins of the co-operative go back to 1983, when the residents of
East Keppoch were suffering from the complete decline of the area and
felt there was little or no hope for them.
At this time, Glasgow District Council began looking at a new scheme
to improve run-down housing estates by setting up co-operatives, with
the idea that residents would take over complete responsibility for
their own housing within a geographical area.
Possil was not one of the areas being considered.
Local residents embarked on a publicity campaign inside and outside
the area. They employed a firm of architects and quantity surveyors,
Gray Aitken, to carry out a feasibility study, and asked for help from
banks and building societies.
Tenants of the estate dogged politicians' footsteps, getting on
flights with them, confronting them at exhibitions and openings, and
even stopping a bus containing Scottish Office officials and persuading
them to look at the local houses.
Eventually residents won the right to form a housing co-operative and
buy a number of houses from the district council. It took them five
years to reach this stage.
Finally, in November 1988, Possil Housing Co-operative was registered
as one of only two fully mutual housing co-operatives in the city and
one of only six housing co-operatives in Scotland.
In 1989, the Housing Corporation offered financial assistance, and the
co-opertative changed its name to Hawthorn Housing Co-operative.
Now the future is looking bright, with joint venture projects with
developers, streetscape projects, and a plan by the Regenerational
Alliance to target the whole area.

YOU could drive a coach and horses through the entrance to this house
near Dollar -- the place was designed for it. The Coach House at
Dollarbeg has a very attractive archway with fine carved stonework, and
it comes with its own horse's trough.
Dating back to around 1889 and built of mellow stone featuring
crowstep gables, it was built as the coach house for the Dollarbeg
estate.
The owners converted the house for their own occupation and it
contains many original oak or pine-panelled floors and period
fireplaces. The principal house has four reception rooms and five
bedrooms, while the guest wing (or grannexe!) has two reception rooms
and two bedrooms.
The house is set in about 2.5 acres of mature woodland, and the
selling agent says a kitchen garden could be created to the rear of the
property, while formal lawns could be laid to the front.
The coach house is close to Dollar and is a good base for those
working almost anywhere in the central belt.
The Dollar area maintains a predominantly rural character, set in
rolling farmlands enhanced by the Ochil Hills. Some of the best trout
fishing in Scotland is to be found at Loch Leven, 10 miles to the east.
The property benefits from full central heating and insulation
throughout. The price is #285,000 through estate agents Lindsays of
Edinburgh.

APART from the immediate and easy access to city centre amenities,
there are other attractions of living in a place like St Andrew's
Square. One very important part of its appeal is the convenience for
work.
''I think this marketplace has grown tremendously in the past few
years because of increasing traffic jams going into work,'' said Ronnie
McLetchie, City Link Director. ''Here there are no parking problems, and
the nearby subway can take you to other parts of the city within
minutes. There is also the investment aspect of buying a quality home.
In the Tannery Building, we have already sold a number of flats and,
over a two-year period, they have increased in value.''
City Link's developments around the square will consist of two, three,
and four-apartment flats, with the larger homes having a separate study
or dining room.
There are eight penthouse flats constructed on two separate storeys,
the third and fourth floors, connected by an internal staircase. All
have balconies overlooking the church and the square, with southerly
aspects over Glasgow Green. Each of the four styles, the Hermiston, the
Waverley, the Lockhart and the Ballantrae, are finished to a very high
standard, and each layout is unique.
While the Hermiston and the Waverley have a lounge, dining room/study,
kitchen and bathroom on the first floor, with two bedrooms and a shower
room above, the Lockhart and the Ballantrae have the master bedroom with
en suite, a second bedroom and bathroom on the first floor, with a
lounge/dining area, kitchen and toilet on the upper level. Prices for
penthouses range from #89,000 to #95,000, and private secure basement
car parking is #5000 extra.
All of the homes in City Link's second phase in St Andrew's Square
have standard specifications like fully fitted kitchens with the
materials selected in advance by the owner and featuring fully
integrated units including oven, ventilated cooker hood, hob,
fridge/freezer, and washer/drier.
The toilets, bathrooms and en suites are all tiled to full ceiling
height and again, the owner can choose the colour which will then be
co-ordinated with tiles. Fixtures and fittings come as standard. The
bedrooms have fitted wardrobes where appropriate and there are focal
point fireplaces in the lounge.
All of the homes have double glazing, and the latest in central
heating systems from ScottishPower -- an innovative ''wet'' electrical
system which, with its DualHeat electric combination boiler provides
all-year-round heating and hot water. Unlike most conventional electric
heating systems, it supplies hot water to a conventional radiator
system. Running costs are low because it uses the new Economy 2000
tariff.
There are elevators in all of the dwellings, running from the basement
to the top floor flats, and an electronic coded entry system. There is
also a security system which includes intruder, smoke and panic alarms.
The St Andrew's Square development has been built internally and
externally to a very high specification.
St Andrew's Square is well worth a visit, especially now that the
latest showflat has been opened. Prices for two-bedroomed flats there
start at #68,000.
For further information about City Link's St Andrew's Square
development, telephone 0141 552 8899 or 0141 334 3420.

NORWEGIAN-BORN Arne Dokka, winner of the United States public links
golf championship in 1965, headed the Shell Scottish Seniors Open
championship pre-qualifying competition with a two-under-par 68 at Royal
Aberdeen Golf Club yesterday.
A naturalised American -- his parents emigrated from Oslo in 1947 when
he was three years old -- Dokka, 51, has been a pro for the past 20
years and now plays out of Pinehurst Country Club, North Carolina.
Dokka's four birdies came mostly through accurate iron play, although
he did hole a 40ft putt for his first birdie. He dropped shots at the
twelfth and thirteenth, mainly because he was not sure of the right line
to the hole on what was only his second outing over the Balgownie
course.
''I love playing in Scotland and on Scottish links in particular and
it's great to be playing golf in nice, cool weather. It's been between
90[DEG] and 100[DEG] back home every day this summer,'' said Dokka.
Sixty players took part in the pre-qualfier, with only 25 going
forward to the 72-hole championship proper, which begins on Friday.
Seven men on 74 played off for the last six places, and Mike Ingham
(Cleckheaton) was relegated to the position of first reserve.
Ingham is one of the original Ernest Butten Boys from the 1960s.
Another one of them, new British Senior Open champion Brian Barnes, is
the hot favourite to take the Scottish title.
Top Scot was Andrew Gauld, now based at Lichtenau-Weickershof in
Germany. He shared second place on 69 with Harry Flatman, from Romford,
and Paul Leonard, from Dumurry in Ireland. Qualifiers:
68 -- A Dokka (USA).
69 -- A Gauld (Scotland), H Flatman (England), P Leonard (Ireland).
70 -- F Boobyer (England).
71 -- S Wilson (England).
72 -- M Moir (Scotland), B Browne (Ireland), S Maharaj (T&amp;T), I D
Smith (Scotland), J Hudson (England), F Hill (England), R Emery
(England).
73 -- J Wilkshire (England), K Magnusson (Sweden), D Melville
(Scotland), J Johnson (England), J Hume (Scotland), R Hurvitz (USA).
74 -- M Gunn (England), P Gill (England), A Bickerdike (England), F C
Agui (Spain), R Jetter (USA), R Webster (Scotland). Eliminated in
play-off -- M Ingham (England).

GREGOR Townsend will know by the weekend whether his home-town club of
Gala or Ian McGeechan's Northampton will have exclusive use of his
services next season, writes Derek Douglas.
Townsend, who has spent most of the summer in Australia, where he is
turning out at stand-off for the Sydney club, Warringah, and for whom he
will be involved in the New South Wales club championship play-offs
against Canberra at the Concorde Oval on Saturday, said yesterday:
''Hopefully, it will all be sorted out by the end of the week.
''I'm still thinking things over and speaking to people back home.
It's a major decision and I don't want to rush into it.''
The key to Townsend's future -- even in this new-age of the
professional game -- is the need to balance his rugby against securing a
job in his chosen field of corporate finance, or as a graduate business
trainee.
Both clubs have been attempting to set up employment opportunities in
Edinburgh and London.
Townsend, 22, has made a full recovery from the knee injury which
threatened to put him out of the game for a year.
At the time the Gala youngster was riding the crest of a wave, having
largely overcome his propensity for the silly errors which were
nicknamed ''Toonyisms'' by his Scotland team-mates.
With a try and the Toony Flip which preceded the Gavin Hastings'
touchdown at Parc des Princes, he had played a central role in
Scotland's historic win over France and seemed set to blossom at the
World Cup in South Africa.
However, only 10 days before the World Cup squad was due to be
announced, Townsend was laid low with the knee injury and the initial
diagnosis that he might be out of the game for 12 months.
Yesterday he said:''Luckily the first prognosis was overly gloomy, and
I was out for just three and a half months. I've played six games over
here since getting back to it, and there have been no problems.''
He returns home on September 20 and so -- irrespective of which club
eventually wins his favours -- will have missed the first three games of
the new Scottish premiership by the time he arrives back.
''Down here in Australia we have had a totally different perspective
on the professionalism issue than has been the case back home. It seemed
to me as if the Australian and New Zealand unions were intent on doing
their own thing irrespective of what the International Board might have
decided at the weekend.
''The Kerry Packer, World Rugby Corporation thing was taken very
seriously indeed down here. I don't think people in the Northern
Hemisphere realise just how close it was.
''I think the radical nature of the International Board's decisions in
Paris took a lot of people by surprise.''

Dundee United 1 Motherwell 2
ALEX McLeish, the Motherwell manager, worried before the game that
Dundee United were the most difficult opponents they could have drawn at
this stage of the Coca-Cola Cup.
In the first half particularly, when United went in front after only
15 minutes, he must have thought that his pre-match comments could prove
prophetic. United had begun the game well, lifted perhaps by their new
singing Jim Bett.
The 36-year-old midfield player had joined the club just hours earlier
and was pushed straight into action, underlining United's need for
inspiration after a poor opening to the season. It worked well enough
early on to allow the Tannadice team to go in front when Robbie Winters
scored.
The goal came after a spectacular drive from Sandy Robertson was
pushed against the bar by Motherwell keeper Scott Howie. Winters reacted
first, and while the Motherwell defence stood spectating, he followed up
to force a header over the line with the keeper stranded.
However, the premier division side gradually began to settle and take
control. By the time Paul Lambert equalised 10 minutes before half time,
it was always going to be Motherwell's night.
Indeed, Lambert might have scored beforehand when Ally Maxwell
one-handed his shot for a corner. And he might have scored again
following his goal with a shot which struck a post and came clear.
When Robertson limped off at the beginning of the second half, United
were forced to chance things around, bringing on Paddy Connolly, and
before manager Billy Kirkwood's side had adapted to the change,
Motherwell had gone into a lead that they were never to lose.
Alex Burns, who had set up the opener for Lambert, was again at the
heart of the action in 58 minutes when he burst into the penalty box and
then whipped the ball across goal to his front-line team-mate Dougie
Arnott to finish things with a shot which went beyond Maxwell and into
goal.
In 74 minutes Andy Roddie blasted a shot against the bar and the ball
was cleared and Motherwell were left, at the end, clinging to a
single-goal lead when they might have had a wider margin.
That allowed United to make a storming finish and twice their Scotland
midfielder, Billy McKinlay, saw shots blocked in the packed penalty
area, first by Brian Martin and then John Philliben.
In the end, however, United never did have the subtlety to create a
clear-cut chance, nor the cutting edge which Motherwell had shown in
their fightback.
Now Motherwell are the team who go into the quarter-final draw on
Friday, having once again confirmed the grit and determination they
showed last season when they battled it out with Rangers at the top of
the premier division.
In contrast, Kirkwood, warned again by the referee in the first half,
finds his team out of this tournament and sitting second bottom of the
first division after a sad start to a season which everyone expected to
be crowned with immediate promotion.
There were six players booked last night, Robertson, McKinlay, and Rab
Shannon, for United, and Motherwell's Arnott, Burns, and Rob McKinnon.
United's bid to find a scoring touch by playing Brian Welsh up front
did not pay off. Still, while Bett went off before the end, replaced by
Scott Crabbe, there were signs from him that he will be able to help the
younger Tannadice players through this critical period.
DUNDEE UNITED -- Maxwell, Perry, Shannon, Dailly, Pressley, Welsh,
McLaren, McKinlay, Robertson, Bett, Winters. Substitutes -- Connolly,
O'Hanlon, Crabbe.
MOTHERWELL -- Howie, May, McKinnon, Roddie, Martin, Philliben,
Lambert, Dolan, Burns, Arnott, McSkimming. Substitutes -- Davies, Woods,
Ritchie.
Referee -- W Crombie (Edinburgh).

MARK Johnston's Branston Jewel can break the winning spell of
Westcourt Magic in the conditions race at York today.
Two other runners go to post for the sprint and neither the Peter
Chapple-Hyam-trained Soviet Style nor Oh Whataknight are without a
chance. But that pair may find themselves fighting for third place money
behind Johnston's filly and the colt which his trainer Mick Easterby
describes as ''a machine.''
Although he has every reason so to do, especially after Westcourt
Magic broke the course record at Thirsk on Friday, it may be that
Easterby's charge has to settle for second best behind Branston Jewel.
The filly made an impressive debut at Windsor 11 days ago when,
despite running green, she landed the odds. While Westcourt Magic has
aquitted himself well, having improved rapidly through the ranks from
selling level to this conditions event, Johnston has always had Group
races in mind for this half-sister of Branston Abby.
Victory this afternoon will set her well on the way towards her
trainer's target, Ascot's Cornwallis Stakes.
Johnston doesn't intend letting the grass grow under Star Rage's feet
for long. This tough handicapper makes a quick reappearance following a
victory at Newcastle on Monday, in the Batley's Handicap.
His trainer feels that he didn't have too hard a race that day but it
is surely too much to ask of the five-year-old to repeat Monday's
success so soon. Richard Hannon's young apprentice Dane O'Neill is in
sparkling form at the moment and he can keep the momentum going at
Sandown courtesy of Inderaputeri, in the Dorking Handicap, and Ice Pick,
in Division 2 of the maiden race.
Martin Pipe, who was disappointed at his failure to go through the
card at Exeter on Friday, could gain compensation by grabbing five of
Newton Abbot's six races, with St Mellion Green, Toomuch Toosoon, Indian
Jockey, Errant Knight, and Most Equal.
The only race on the card without a Pipe runner, the Twins Novices'
Hurdle, should go to Philip Hobbs' Dallachio.
* BLUSHING Gleam beat Paul Cole's Like A Hawk to record an impressive
success in the Group 3 Prix du Calvados at Deauville yesterday.

SCOTLAND'S Shirley Robertson, who continues to dominate the
single-handed Europe class, took another step closer to confirming her
selection for Savannah with two further wins to maintain an unbeaten
record in all five races at the Brut British Olympic Sailing Trials off
Weymouth yesterday.
In contrast, Scotland's leading 470-crew, Andy Richards and Ian Park,
were putting a brave face on a fifth place yesterday, and now lie fifth
overall.
The Helensburgh pair have spent every summer weekend logging the wind
directions, and eking out every last knot of boat speed from Weymouth's
light summer breezes -- chosen specifically to mirror the prevailing
light winds expected at next year's Olympic site.
Richards and Park fought up to third in yesterday's race but on the
last lap got on the wrong side of a wind shift which slid race leaders
Paul Brotherton and Steve Lovering back to sixth and elevated English
youngsters Jamie Lea and Simon Hughes to their first win this week.
Series leaders -- John Merricks and Ian Walker took second to increase
their overall lead.
Scotland lead the third leg of the Teachers' Round Britain Challenge
with Jon Fitzgerald's Glendronach lying second and Paul Jeffes' Lord
Inverforth in third. British Race Five results:
Tornado class -- 1, D Williams and I Rhodes (Eng); 5, K Sproul and S
Irish (Sco/Eng).
Europe. -- 1, S Robertson (Sco); 2, J Singleton (Eng); 3, A Lucas
(Eng); 8, K Coupland (Sco); 10, D Winstanley (Sco).
470 -- 1, J Lea and S Hughes (Eng); 2, J Merricks and I Walker (Eng);
3, J Belben and M Fenwick (Eng); 4, R and I Lovering (Eng); 5, A
Richards and I Park (Sco); 11, N Biggs and M Turner (Wal/Sco); 13, R
Burns and I Boag (Sco); 15, I Jameson and A Green (Sco).
Teacher's Round Britain Challenge: Positions at 1700hrs -- 1, Pride of
Belfast (D Gomes) (Ire) 649-miles to go; 2, Glendronach (J Fitzgerald)
(Sco); 3, Lord Inverforth (P Jeffes) (Sco); 4, Lion d'Or (JP Saliou)
(Fra); 5, Dream of Erin (D Harte) (Ire) 649.

RACING UPDATE
VINDALOO only just failed to claim the outright 20th century record
for Flat handicap wins in a season at Ripon yesterday.
Victory No.10 looked on the cards as Jason Weaver's mount hit the
front a furlong out in the trophy race, the gelding's twenty-fifth
outing of the year. But Kevin Darley on Mellottie had other ideas.
Nearer last than first two furlongs out, the rider timed his challenge
to perfection on the 1991 Cambridgeshire winner, who got up to land the
spoils in a driving finish.
''The winning post just came too late,'' added trainer Jimmy Harris.
Vindaloo may make a quick bid to claim the record outright from
current joint-holders Chaplain's Club, Glencroft and Abell's Star Rage.
''He might go to York on Thursday for a mile and a half race,'' said
Harris ''we'll have to see how he is, though he looks pretty well now.''
SUSAN Piggott, wife of former champion jockey Lester, signed off her
eight-year training career when Alamein contested the maiden race at
Ripon yesterday.
Her final runner could not quite make it a successful curtain-call but
ran on gamely to finish fourth behind Dashing Blue.
''I just wish I could have gone out on a winning note,'' said Susan
''That would have been the icing on the cake. It's difficult to think of
a highlight in my training career as any winner -- from a seller to a
big race -- all come the same.
''It's also difficult to think of a best horse, though Nicholas was a
very, very good horse and Lester gained his first win on his comeback on
him at Chepstow.
* GROUND conditions at Doncaster's St Leger meeting, which starts a
week today, look like being perfect.
Clerk of the course John Sanderson said: ''There is excellemt grass
cover and watering will take place as necessary to maintain the
condition of the track.'' The going at the moment is good to firm, good
in places.
* WATERLOO Boy, found to have broken a leg in his box, has been
humanely destroyed.

MULTIPLE-occupancy housing affects an estimated 5000 properties in
Glasgow. The city is said to have very strong views about it, so what's
involved?
At its simplest, it's about preventing possible exploitation. Not
quite the ''10 people in one broom cupboard'' syndrome, but that kind of
thing. It addressed the problems of lots of people living in one area,
perhaps making a bit of a din late at night as they clatter up and down
stairs, even having a party from time to time.
''We also have to look at important aspects such as environmental
health, planning, and building control,'' says Ian Robert, a chief
planning officer with Glasgow District.
It's nothing to do with large families or hotels. It is, in fact,
covered by the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, the Housing (Management of
Houses and Buildings in Multiple Occupation) (Scotland) Regulation 1964,
and other related legislation.
Houses in multiple occupation cover bedsits, flats or houses let in
lodgings, shared flats or houses, and hostels and bed and breakfast
guest houses, where residents have their principal or only home.
Anyone -- resident or landlord -- who wants to be on the right side of
the law should ask for a copy of three free leaflets produced by the
council covering environmental health, planning, and building control.
''Nowadays, we have managed to eliminate the worst of the bad
practices,'' says Ian Robert. ''It's chasing a moving target, however,
and is still a problem.
''It can affect all sorts of people -- students, nurses, young
professional people. Any place used for multiple occupancy should be
registered with us. The conditions and requirements are clearly laid
out.
''You can't have more than a certain percentage of an area in multiple
occupation, for example. There must be a sensible quality of life,
without noise and nuisance for others.''
The regulations cover fire safety, the disposal of household refuse,
proper ventilation, piped hot and cold water, and the number of
unrelated people on the premises -- four or more in the West End local
plan area, and three elsewhere.
Professional letting agencies get their share of the problems as well.
As one agent, who sticks rigidly to the rules, put it: ''You have to
turn down people, because you don't go in for illegal multiple
occupation.
''They point out that ''Joe Bloggs next door'' has rooms. Why are you
so unfeeling? A bit later, they come back. Their landlord has been found
out. They're out on their ear. Why can't you help? Why don't you care?
It's still quite a problem, I would say.''

Scots could be caught out by a new law if they unwittingly commit
themselves into legally binding contracts. The Requirements of Writing
(Scotland) Act 1995 came into effect on August 1 and aims to simplify
the need for special written forms. But the new rules will affect some
agreements in residential and commercial property and in credit matters.
Dorothy Kellas, partner of lawyers Morton Fraser Milligan, says:
''Anyone entering into a contract should be very careful that they are
not bound into a legally enforceable obligation without realising it.
''For example, someone may write to an estate agent outlining the
basis on which they are prepared to offer for a house. If accepted, this
correspondence could be seen as legally binding, whereas in the past it
was unlikely to be so. So now people could find themselves committed to
huge personal expenditure before they have had a chance to take legal
advice. You must therefore watch what you sign with much greater
vigilance.''
With regard to business matters, extreme care should be taken in any
informal exchanges relating to contracts or negotiations. Surveyors in
particular are affected by negotiations regarding the sale, purchase or
leasing of land or buildings.
Dorothy Kellas recommends that people seek legal advice as soon as
possible, should they have any concerns.
She suggests the addition of a clause in to any verbal or written
communication which makes it clear that what is said in the letter, or
conversation, ''is not intended to be binding upon you or form part of
any contract between you''.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown has been convinced by goalkeeper Andy
Goram that he is ready, willing, and able to play for his country. The
Rangers' star, therefore, was named in the national squad yesterday.
Brown had spoken to Ibrox manager Walter Smith as well as Goram before
committing himself to the player's selection. After having been given
reassurances about the goalkeeper's commitment to his country's cause,
he then made his decision.
Said Brown yesterday: ''I asked Andy Goram whether he wanted to play
for Scotland and whether he was fit to play for Scotland. He gave me a
positive response on both counts and that is why he has re-joined the
group.
''There have been no guarantees given about playing against Finland
because it is too early to do that. I am just happy that we now have two
world class goalkeepers together in the squad.''
Brown then added: ''There have been no deals done over this. And there
have been no promises made. Andy's attitude and his enthusiasm for a
return to the squad were enough for me.''
Commonsense seems to have prevailed between Brown and his reluctant
star who left the squad last time round maintaining that he was not
''mentally attuned'' for the game against Greece.
If Goram now declares himself ready to join the other players, then
Brown is right to give him another chance. As I pointed out yesterday,
we are not over-burdened with players of Goram's undoubted calibre.
Veteran Jim Leighton may still take No.l spot at Hampden next week,
but if we reach the finals -- and victory over Finland practically
guarantees that -- then Goram will be required in England next summer.
For the moment, Brown has more to concern himself with than a
goalkeeping situation which appears to have been resolved. He must still
worry, for instance, over his strike force.
At first glance, the six men named offer him scoring options and
dangerous partnerships. Looking deeper, there are worries over fitness
and sharpness among his front players.
Aberdeen's Duncan Shearer has not played since the Greek game because
of suspension, and he now has a calf knock. John Spencer cannot get into
Chelsea's first team. And, on his own admission, the team manager still
harbours some doubts over the match readiness of veteran Ally McCoist
and the re-emerging Aberdeen striker, Scott Booth.
However, he has hopes that these worries will clear before the game.
He does admit: ''We have suffered from not being able to field a settled
strike force because of injuries. Right now, we are no nearer being able
to do so. I have been impressed by Scott Booth, a player we missed badly
last season after he was injured against Russia. He is quick and a good
finisher, and we want him back. But we are aware that he has played only
a few games since last year,
''McCoist might start the game this time -- but, again, we have to see
how his match sharpness is before we get down to selection. That is why
I have named six front men and you can take it as read that four of them
will be involved in the game, just as against the Greeks. Two will play
from the start with two others on the bench ready to go on.''
However, while questions still abound over the front men, the rest of
next week's team will retain a familiar and solid look. Brown knows the
midfield he wants, and he also will rely on defenders who have proved
themselves throughout a campaign which is now nearing its close.
They have given away few goals, and Brown will be looking to that
miserliness continuing at Hampden. If it does, and if whatever strike
force he produces can knock in a goal or two, then qualification would
be assured.
Brown, however, is still cautious. He does not want to see his players
fail at this late stage of the qualifying group and he says: ''Finland
are a proud nation and they will want to come back after that 6-0 defeat
from Russia. They must also realise that if they do not win then their
hopes of qualification have gone. A draw could still be enough for us --
but not for them.
''A lot of our thinking about the game will depend on whether their
top player, Jari Litmanen, is chosen. He missed the last game against
the Russians, but if they believe they can still qualify, then I think
he would return and that would affect our own tactical approach to this
one.
''If he is in, then I believe they will open out a bit and that should
suit us. There will be no complacency, though, among my players. There
is too much at stake for that to happen.''
Meanwhile the game is heading for a sell-out with the born-again
Tartan Army turning out in force once more. A spokesman for the SFA
stressed yesterday that those fans who wish to go to the game next week
should buy tickets now.

Airdrie 2, Hibernian 0
IT was tough and it was uncompromising. It was just the way Airdrie
like it, and for the second successive season, the first-division club
without a home of their own took on Hibernian in the Coca-Cola Cup and
nudged them through the exit.
Last year, the Diamonds beat Hibs 2-1 in a quarter-final tie in
Edinburgh, and not a great many people expected the premier-division
side to suffer similarly again. But Airdrie have a tremendous cup record
in recent times, and they were utterly determined to attract more
attention to themselves.
In fact, the tie was won and lost after only nine minutes when Jim
Leighton was beaten for the second time, and although Hibs, who had
defended wildly and without cohesion in the first half, improved
dramatically in the second period, Airdrie were able to hold on to their
lead.
Of course life became much more straightforward for them after Kevin
Harper, whose darting speed and control had been a threat from the
beginning, was sent off in 70 minutes for a foul on Tommy McIntyre.
As though his dismissal was not enough to concern Hibs' manager Alex
Miller, he had to watch Scottish international striker Darren Jackson
take a penalty two minutes from time and balloon the ball over John
Martin's bar and off into the black night over Cumbernauld.
Miller shook his head in despair.
What a night, what a disgraceful defensive performance from his lot,
who were kept indoors for a long time after the final whistle.
Eventually, the manager emerged from the dressing room and said of his
team's defensive frailties: ''Too many people trying to be too clever.''
In particular, he was referring to Hibs' Steven Tweed, who scored
Airdrie's first goal. In seven minutes, the ball was played into the box
and Tweed rose to connect, but succeeded only in looping a header over
the stranded Jim Leighton.
The manager was looking even more forlorn and he refused to provide
his side ''with a get out'' by drawing attention to the number of
players he had to do without at Broadwood in last night's third-round
tie.
Miller did have to do without Graeme Mitchell, Keith Wright, and
Willie Miller, but Airdrie also were without three players -- Kenny
Black, Paul Jack, and Sandy Stewart because of injury and suspension.
''All players I would hang my hat on,'' said their manager, Alex
MacDonald, who prevented any of his triumphant side from talking about
their victory after the game.
Jimmy Sandison and Martin, players who normally can't resist an
audience, made their way out of the ground heads bowed and looking
apologetic, but MacDonald's word is law and he was determined that no
more of his players would find themselves in trouble with the SFA
because of comments attributed to them in the newspapers.
Two of his people have received letters from Bleak House and because
last night's tie had been, shall we say, robust, he told everyone to
keep quiet.
Perhaps after the next round he might relent, even if they don't
manage to go any further although they played last night like a team
intent on reaching yet another cup final. ''Doesn't matter who we get in
the next round,'' he said. 'We don't even have our own hoose, but we'll
go anywhere for a piece 'n' jam.''
Airdrie's second goal was scored by Jimmy Boyle in nine minutes when
he thumped the ball into the roof of Leighton's net, and again Hibs'
defence was negligent. ''We had five men in the box and Airdrie had two,
with one coming in support,'' Miller said as though still unable to
accept that it had happened. ''Yet, their player (Boyle) is unmarked
close to goal.''
Hopefully he will have a word with Harper, whose challenge on McIntyre
was silly and could have caused serious damage.
His team-mates, Pat McGinlay, and Michael O'Neill, also professionals
with flair and ability, were booked and Airdrie had four players
cautioned. Both McIntyres, Tommy and Jimmy, Tony Smith, who had a good
match shuttling up and down the left, and Stephen Tait, a substitute for
the injured Sean Sweeney, were cautioned by referee Jim McCluskey.
Sweeney was hurt in a tackle with Harper after only 15 minutes, and
MacDonald said afterwards: ''Sweeney had three stud marks on a knee.
Four and it could have been serious.''
MacDonald expressed himself pleased with the evening's work, and the
manner in which they coped with their more illustrious opponents was
acceptable. They knew Hibs would be stung into action after having
fallen behind, but Airdrie absorbed the Edinburgh side's attacks before
eventually pressing forward themselves and threatening to score a third.
AIRDRIE -- Martin, Boyle, T McIntyre, Sandison, Sweeney, Davies,
Wilson, Harvey, J McIntyre, Duffield, Smith. Substitutes -- Cooper,
Connelly, Tait.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, Jackson, Dods, McGinlay, Tweed, Hunter,
McAllister, Millen, Harper, Jackson, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Donald,
Weir, Love.
Referee -- J McCluskey (Stewarton).

IF Allan Dreghorne's masterpiece St Andrew's Parish Church could talk,
what a tale it would have to tell. Completed in 1759, it has witnessed
-- and is about to witness again -- some of the finest and most
prosperous years of one of Glasgow's most historic areas: St Andrew's
Square.
The houses on St Andrew's Square were originally built as elegant town
houses for the businessmen and merchants of Glasgow, who combined the
sophistication of city living with the pleasures associated with the
open landscapes of Glasgow Green, literally on the doorstep, where they
could enjoy a game of golf or a leisurely stroll.
St Andrew's Square was a hub of gracious living. It was only minutes
away from where David Dale, co-founder with Robert Owen of the
conservation village of New Lanark and vice-president of Britain's first
Chamber of Commerce, built his magnificent mansion, designed by Adam, in
Charlotte Street.
It was a stone's throw from Monteith Row, another prestigious address
for the rich and successful. Its reputation was maintained until well
into this century, with doctors and lawyers still living there in the
1930s.
Against that background, almost two centuries later, St Andrew's
Square is being re-created by City Link Developments in association with
Glasgow Development Agency and Glasgow District Council, and has been
designed to re-capture that period of beauty and refinement.
''We are looking forward to the regeneration of another part of the
city going ahead positively and coming back into residential use after
lying derelict for some time,'' said Ronnie McLetchie, director of City
Link Developments. ''We see this as a return to gracious living first
created in the time of the tobacco lords.''
The square is bordered by London Road, High Street and Glasgow Green.
Its majestic focal point is St Andrew's Parish Church, at present used
for recitals, which is flanked at either entrance to the square by two
refurbished listed buildings, the Orphanage and the Tannery.
These ''book-ends'' of the square are joined by a third existing
listed building, the Hide, Skin &amp; Tallow building round the corner in
Greendyke Street.
The St Andrew's Square area was the first town planning exercise for
Glasgow. Sadly, over a long period, as fortunes came and went and the
city began to sprawl beyond its original limits, the buildings fell into
disrepair, and latterly many were converted into warehouses and
workshops.
Now City Link's architect Robert Johnston has created a sympathetic
design using natural stone, and the result is a terrace of classical
homes which will re-create and complement the Georgian architecture of
the original existing buildings. The planning guidelines were fairly
rigid and involved creating a master plan for the whole area
incorporating the development of the eight packages.
City Link has already refurbished the Tannery and is developing the
buildings around the square, while Scotia House is responsible for the
Orphanage. Woolwich Homes is developing the buildings around St Andrews
on the Green, and the New Housing Association is developing proposals
for housing along London Road.
The building programme for St Andrew's Square is now well under way,
the Tannery Building is complete and all 18 town flats and two office
units have been sold.
City Link's current phase is the building of 122 new flats around St
Andrew's Square. These are being constructed with Georgian-style stone
facades.
City Link has found that residents of the nearby Merchant City
development are a potential market, as their requirements change and
they want to move on to something bigger, with accompanying parking
facilities. A number of people living in The Tannery have come from the
Merchant City.

UNDER-21s:
PETER Handyside of Grimsby was brought back into Scotland's under-21
squad yesterday, and was immediately tipped to be the ''new Alan
Hansen'' by national team manager Craig Brown.
Handyside, 21, missed the Toulon tournament in the summer, and was
absent from the Greek game two weeks ago while he shook off the effects
of an end-of-season injury.
Now, with skipper Steven Pressley suspended, Dumfries-born Handyside
makes a return as Brown indicates a partnership at the heart of the
defence with Dundee United's Christian Dailly, Scotland's most capped
player at this level.
Brown said: ''Peter is someone who likes to play football from the
back, and that is something that the Under-21 coach Tommy Craig and
myself want to encourage. He is the new Alan Hansen and we are glad to
have him back with the pool of players for this important game.''
The match could catapult the young Scots into the European
Championship quarter-finals if they can win. The only defeat they have
suffered so far is in Finland in the opening game of the group. Now a
revenge victory would put the youngsters through ahead of the Finns.
But Brown warned: ''This is almost as vital to Finland as the full
international because they can see the chance to qualify for the Olympic
games. That is as important to them as the European finals.
''But our lads have been going well since that opening match, and we
believe we can win this one.''
The game takes place at Broadwood next Wednesday with a 1pm kick-off
as an appetiser to the main hampden event. Squad:
Stillie (Aberdeen), Gardiner (Hibernian), Hamilton (Dundee), Baker (St
Mirren), Handyside (Grimsby), McNamara (Dunfermline), Crawford (Raith),
Fullarton (St Mirren), Glass (Aberdeen), Gray (Celtic), Hannah (Dundee
Utd), Harper (Hibernian), Locke (Hearts), McLaughlin (Celtic), Murray
(Rangers), O'Neill (Clyde), Dailly (Dundee Utd), Donnelly (Celtic),
Liddell (Barnsley), McCann (Dundee), Miller (Rangers).

A GREAT deal of the important work on a KDL home is done before a
brick has been laid, for the company goes to enormous lengths to search
out sites where the quality of the environment will match the quality of
the housing.
The Moorings development at Cove Road, Gourock, shows just how well
this policy can pay off, for the site overlooks Cardwell Bay, with
stunning views across the Clyde to Cove and Kilcreggan, and the owners
will have the exclusive use of a deep water slipway just across the
road.
The scheme consists of 20 two-bedroom flats in five blocks, and so
that owners can enjoy the views across the Clyde, the homes have been
designed with balconies on all the upper floors, and with small private,
terraced gardens on the ground floors.
Prices range from #83,500 to #91,000. Once the flat has been selected,
a deposit of #250 secures the reservation at a fixed price. This deposit
is included in the final purchase price.
The Moorings fronts onto Cove Road, which is a cul-de-sac on the east
side of Gourock, just past Battery Park as you approach from Glasgow.
The site was bought by KDL homes in 1993. It had been occupied by local
yacht builder, but became an eyesore after the shipyard closed five
years ago.
The managing director of KDL Homes, Tom Paice, says: ''We have greatly
improved the visual appeal of the whole coastline and general
environment, while at the same time providing for owners at The Moorings
what I consider to be the finest view in the West of Scotland.''
KDL homes is an expanding company which specialises in building in the
Central Belt. It has established a reputation for distinctive, spacious
homes, constructed to the highest specifications, finished to the
highest standards and set in attractive surroundings.
The Dumbarton-based firm started business in March 1987 and has found
a niche market developing sites in Central Scotland of up to 40 homes in
places such as Strathaven, Busby, Helensburgh, Skelmorlie, Lenzie and
Falkirk.
KDL Homes is happy to customise their luxury homes to individual
requirements so long as this is indicated in advance. Colour schemes can
be coordinated, archways can be constructed, extra power points can be
incorporated -- in fact, all reasonable requests can be complied with.
At The Moorings in Gourock, there is a choice of three styles, A, B
and C. Styles A and B have a separate dining room, while style C has a
kitchen/dining room. Three of the five blocks of flats are two-storey
and the other two, which are larger, are three-storey. The two larger
blocks contain style C, and the homes on the upper two floors are
particularly spacious, with living rooms extending to 17ft 4in by 17ft
1in.
The Moorings development, set in a secluded area, offers luxury living
in an outstanding coastal location.

COCA-COLA CUP PREVIEW
THE biggest threat to Rangers in tonight's Coca-Cola Cup third-round
tie could be a fragile state of mind rather than anything their Division
2 opponents, Stirling Albion, might conjure up.
The Ibrox side are having to spread their attention over a wide
playing field which stretches from domestic cup ties all the way up to
Champions' League football.
Even yesterday, while manager Walter Smith was preparing his players
for the game at Ibrox, news from the European front was still filtering
through, and the latest bulletin should be to Rangers' benefit because
Steaua Bucharest's captain, Marius Lacatus, will be suspended for the
opening tie in Group C on Wednesday, September 13.
Lacatus was booked in both of Steaua's preliminary matches, as was
Rangers' David Robertson, but the Romanian's absence will be the greater
loss. Smith's right-hand man, Archie Knox, will watch Steaua when they
open their league programme tonight and they will be examined again when
they play a week on Friday.
By then, Rangers hope to have demonstrated their desire to make up for
last season's early exit in the Coca-Cola Cup -- they were beaten by
Falkirk -- and work towards that end begins this evening.
''My main concern is that the players will be coming off some big and
important matches for this club, and that maybe they might not treat
this game in the same manner,'' said Smith, who will travel to Germany
on Friday to watch Borussia Dortmund, another of their Champions' League
rivals.
''However, I hope the run of results we have had continues and that we
can avoid another early exit in this competition.''
Smith was unsure last night whether or not Richard Gough would be able
to play against Stirling Albion, who were beaten 4-0 by the Ibrox side
in a pre-season tournament, because the captain has a stomach upset.
Although he couldn't train last night, he hopes to have recovered in
time to maintain his partnership with Gordan Petric at the heart of the
defence.
Brian Laudrup and Paul Gascoigne are close to full fitness again, but
neither will be risked.
Oleg Salenko, who made his debut as a substitute in Saturday's match
against Kilmarnock, played and scored for the reserves at Rugby Park
last night, and provided he reports back this morning without injury, he
will be used as a substitute against Albion. ''The idea is to give Oleg
as many matches as possible to increase his sharpness,'' the manager
said.
Albion, of course, are managed by former Rangers striker Kevin
Drinkell, who knows the kind of dangers which can befall the unprepared
at Ibrox. ''It would be foolish to think that we could hold out because
an onslaught will come at some point,'' he said.
''However, I have no injuries -- everyone wants to play at Ibrox as
you might imagine -- but it does worry me that some people have been
saying Rangers are not playing too well. That's when they are liable to
come out and do something.''
Falkirk, beaten 3-2 by Aberdeen at Brockville on Saturday, entertain
the Pittodrie side again tonight, and they will be especially vigilant
with regard to Scott Booth who scored the winner.
The stiker was named yesterday in the Scotland squad for next week's
European Championship qualifying tie against Finland, and it will be
intersting to see how he celebrates his return to the big time.
Partick Thistle will be relieved to get back on the pitch and away
from talk about a possible take over, but Livingston won't be easily
beaten on their own turf. Remember they beat St Johnstone in the
previous round.
Hearts are at home to Dunfermline in what could be one of the ties of
this round, and the Tynecastle side's striker, John Robertson, should be
back in his leading role after injury.
George Shaw could be back in Dundee's side for their tie against
Kilmarnock at Dens Park. ''We have had other front players doing well,
but George has made it clear he is bursting to play,'' said Dundee's
manager, Jim Duffy.

Atherton lead by example and the praises showered upon him by West
Indies' manager Wesley Hall was indeed something of which to be proud '
AFTER having drawn the last Test series against the West Indies it is
all too easy to become carried away that the England team is better than
it really is, but as ANDY JALIL explains, they have taken a step in the
right direction.
ENGLAND surrendered the Wisden Trophy 22 years ago when they went
down, at Lord's, to the West Indies. Now, after more than two decades of
attempting to win it back, this latest series provided them with the
best chance of getting their hands once again on the elusive silverware.
They failed but the pluses gained from this intensely contested series
have outweighed the minuses and have given a clear indication that Mike
Atherton and his men had taken a small but positive step in the
direction of a revival in English cricket.
Throughout this glorious summer, the fortunes have swayed and when it
came to the final showdown it balanced out.
For England, who have suffered five defeats in six series here since
1973 against the West Indies, this drawn encounter will be quite
heartening.
Atherton has shown with his own performance with the bat as well as
his captaincy that he has the ability to instil confidence and
enthusiasm in a team that has struggled season after season.
It may be a shade early to speak about a definite revival of English
cricket, for until England have won a series abroad and performed
consistently well at home, a true measure cannot be taken. That they are
on the road towards it, may be a fairer assessment.
Certainly, there are players who have emerged from this gripping
series with encouraging performances.
Dominic Cork was outstanding from the time of his debut at Lord's with
a seven-for-43 spell. He followed that with four for 69 at Edgbaston and
then crowned it all with four wickets in each innings in the next Test,
which included a hat trick. His batting brought valuable runs as did
Mike Watkinson's, particularly, at Trent Bridge in a heroic partnership
with Richard Illingworth. The Lancashire captain's bowling, too, proved
more than adequate.
Graham Thorpe was most consistent and took his aggregate of runs to
506 in the series. He became the only England batsman to score that many
in a single series in 67 years of Test cricket between the two
countries.
A much-maligned Graeme Hick proved his point, after his highly
publicised talk with the chairman of selectors. It remains to be seen,
however, if he has permanently rectified his weakness against the
short-pitched fast deliveries.
Atherton himself, lead by example. His fighting qualities and tenacity
was never more in evidence than on the last day of the series, and
during the hour on the previous evening. The praises showered upon him
by West Indies' manager, Wesley Hall, was indeed something of which to
be proud.
While the excellent performances of the mighty West Indians, who
dominated world cricket after the mid-seventies, were largely to be
expected, mention must be made of Brian Lara, the man of the match and
the West Indies' player of the series.
He stood out above all others with three centuries and hitting 765
runs at an average of 85. But the most extraordinary feat was reserved
for his final innings on Saturday when his 179 transformed the match,
taking it out of England's grasp and putting West Indies in a commanding
position.
It has been an enthralling, vivid series which has generated
scintillating cricket, and one which will be remembered for many a year.
Perhaps, the only reservation is that for the final showdown with both
teams level at 2-2, the benign Oval wicket remained too true to produce
a clinical finish.

* WHEN Glasgow echoed to the thunder of dark satanic mills, its
schools were full of coughing children. Smoke and chemicals from the
foundries, forges, locomotive works, mines and shipyards turned
buildings black -- and filled the young lungs with soot.
Yet the city was surrounded by beautiful countryside and clean air.
Charities were set up to offer the poor a holiday away from the gloom.
In a bid to offer a ''fresh-air fortnight'' to the peely-wally weans of
Glasgow, Montrose House was built on the banks of Loch Lomond at Balmaha
by the Duchess of Montrose in 1891.
It was a generous gesture, though the low building costs of 100 years
ago meant that charity came at an economic price. The building's fine
red sandstone came from a local quarry on the banks of the Catterburn.
The price was four shillings (20p) per ton!
Today's Glasgow is a cleaner place inhabited by kids who enjoy their
fresh-air fortnights in Benidorm or Magaluf, so the imposing building
has had to find a new use. Recently refurbished and converted into three
apartments, it now offers a ''fresh-air lifetime' at an affordable
price. Each apartment is self-contained and has its own entrance. Every
window has been replaced, and new plumbing and wiring have been
installed. Each also has central heating, new bathroom, new kitchen, and
a private garden. And each has a view of Loch Lomond. Many interior
details have been retained.
The ground floor has been turned into two dwellings. Clyde Property is
seeking offers over #70,000 for a two-bedroom flat and offers over
#85,000 for a three-bedroom one (which comes with its own patio and
French doors). The whole of the upper floor has been turned into a
single apartment with two public rooms and three bedrooms. Access is via
the original entrance vestibule and reception hall -- offers over
#97,000.

PAUL Gascoigne of Rangers is included in an England squad remarkable
more for a who's who of missing names for next week's rearranged
friendly against Colombia at Wembley.
There is no Paul Ince, Les Ferdinand, Warren Barton or Matthew Le
Tissier as Terry Venables gears up for the first of his European
Championship countdown games
Also out are Umbro Cup disappointments John Scales, Colin Cooper and
David Unsworth plus injury-hit Darren Anderton and understudy goalkeeper
Ian Walker.
But Venables has also included Stan Collymore, along with Gascoigne,
although injuries could rule out both.
But the biggest surprise is the inclusion of Coventry's summer
signing, 26-year-old winger John Salako, who is now given the chance to
resurrect his England career four years after a serious knee injury
threatened to put him out of the game. Squad:
Seaman (Arsenal), Flowers (Blackburn), Jones (Liverpool), G Neville
(Man Utd), Adams (Arsenal), Howey (Newcastle), Pallister (Man Utd), Le
Saux (Blackburn), Pearce (Nottm Forest), McManaman (Liverpool), Platt
(Arsenal), Lee (Newcastle), Redknapp (Liverpool), Batty (Blackburn),
Barnes (Liverpool), Gascoigne (Rangers), Wise (Chelsea), Sheringham
(Tottenham), Beardsley (Newcastle), Barmby (Middlesbrough), Collymore
(Liverpool), Salako (Coventry), Shearer (Blackburn).

AIRDRIE last night paid tribute to one of their most notable former
players, Paul Jonquin, who died earlier in the day of a brain tumour.
Jonquin, in his fifties, was the longest-serving player in the club's
history, joining them in October, 1961, and playing his final game in
April, 1979.
An fine defender, he played in 708 first-team games including a run of
196 consecutive matches between April 1967 and September, 1971, in the
days before substitutes.
He played during the period when Airdrie had success in the Texaco
Cup, a competition between teams from Scotland and England, and was
right-back in the Airdrie side which won the Spring Cup in 1976. He also
was a member of the Scottish Cup final team defeated by Celtic in 1975.

WATSONIANS became the latest first-division clubs to announce a
sponsorship deal with a brewing company, prompting the notion that the
game in Scotland is being consumed by beer as opposed to vice versa.
The Myreside club will benefit from a three-year agreement with
Caledonian Brewers of Edinburgh, whose logo will be worn on the
Watsonian jerseys, track suits, and kit bags.
It is as yet unknown whether the new deal, revealed just two days
after the momentous announcement from Paris about professionalism will
result in payments being made to Watsonian players.
''It is too early to say about player payment,'' said Ian Monteath,
club president, who added: ''we will discuss the matter at committee
level and with other clubs in Scotland.
''What I can say is that it will be very difficult to pay players this
year. We would need more money coming into the club.'' That possibility
may not yet be ruled out. According to a Watsonian committee man, the
Edinburgh club's dialogue with the Gartcosh businessman, John Connor,
whose son, Fraser, is a scrum half at Myreside, ''remains open.''
Watsonians finances would seem to be directed more towards the
#400,000 project to upgrade Myreside, permission for which is being
sought from Edinburgh District Council's planning department.
Plans for ground redevelopment reveal improvements and an extension to
the east terracing to bring the spectator capacity up to 7000, a
four-corner flood lighting system, and high-quality sports ground
advertising.
The club also released details of their first XV squad which, for the
second consecutive season, is under the direction of Peter Gallagher.
There will be no Sean Fitzpatrick at Myreside but Watsonians have
recruited a number of potentially useful players this season.
In addition to Kiwis, Cameron Mather and Mike Stanaway, who return for
another season, Gallagher will have in his squad New Zealanders Stuart
Mather, the North Shore tighthead prop, and hooker Si Farland, an under
21 All Black.
Also listed for this season are Calum Crozier, the former Australian
schools No.8, and New Zealander Mark te Whaiti, who has moved from
Currie. Watsonians also have recruited well from domestic stocks.
The top newcomers are Scotland under-21 flanker Stuart Grimes, North
and Midlands prop Tom Smith, Haddington hooker Grant McKelvie, and GHK
flanker Craig Brown. It also was confirmed yesterday that Watsonians, in
common with a number of other senior clubs in Scotland, will run an
under-21 side, an extensive fixture list for which has already been
drawn up.

BRUCE Flockhart looks set to become the first Scot to play badminton
for Britain at the Olympics after reaching No.29 in the new world
rankings.
The 23-year-old is now the highest-placed Brit ahead of former
European champion Darren Hall and Anders Nielsen, with only the top two
in the rankings looking set to go to Atlanta in 1996.
Flockhart reached the third round of the Canadian Open last week to
jump up 12 places. The Stirling University student is on domestic turf
this weekend at the Perth Open, where the Scottish champion lines up as
a 5/8 seed in the same half of the draw as Nielsen.
Anne Gibson, the London-based Scottish champion who was recently
dropped from the Olympic squad, moved back up to world No.41 after
reaching the quarter-finals of the Canadian Open. She is 3/4 seed in the
same section as Jo Muggeridge, who beat her in last year's final.

MELROSE are to embark on extensive developments at their Greenyards
ground, birthplace of seven-a-side rugby. An extraordinary general
meeting of the club decided that the #630,000 scheme should go ahead
once planning permission had been granted by Borders Regional Council.
Plans include moving the pitch four metres away from the stand. New
drainage and, perhaps, undersoil heating would be installed, as would
floodlighting, and the stand also would be developed.

NEIL Kinnock and I agree. This is a slightly unusual statement to be
found in any of my musings, yet I doff my cap to the former Labour
leader, now European Commissioner, for his remarks about the
professionalisation of rugby football. ''I am rather sad about it,'' he
commented, ''and I wonder if the game will be quite the same in the
future.'' So do I.
Before the charge of ''old bufties'' is laid, that we are accused of
looking back to a golden age which never existed, or of attempting to
prevent young men making the most of their talents, let me make this
clear. I have no problem at all with the premise that players should be
paid. It must be 10 years ago since I suggested a flat fee should be
placed in a player's Trust Fund for every international cap he gained.
Anyone, however, who believes that the new ''Declaration of Paris'' is
going to lead to the famous ''level playing field'' deserves to be run
over by a lawnmower.
Craig Chalmers will not be paid the same as Jonah Lomu; Scottish
players will not earn the same as the All Blacks. And professional rugby
might well make some participants worse off than they are at the moment.
Before developing those arguments, let me pay a tribute at the
graveside of the amateur game. At its best rugby provided fun and
fellowship for millions; it was a sport almost completely free of
cheating, of fixed matches, of drug abusers.
There was a high degree of sportsmanship, referees decisions were
rarely questioned, and international matches provided players and
spectators alike with thrilling moments to savour.
The much-derided amateur ethic, that you did your job during the week
and had your recreation at the weekends, made a lot of sense. Playing
for eight, maybe 10 months of the year at a physically demanding, and
sometimes dangerous sport -- even for money -- is maybe not so smart.
Amateur rugby was not sold out by greedy players, but by weak and
indecisive administrators. It was the International Rugby Football Board
who refused to take any action against their own members who blatantly
flouted the laws laid down. That was what made a professional sport
inevitable.
In Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, France, Wales and England,
illegal payments were made every week of the season. The move towards
''anthing goes'' at least, in the words of Fred McLeod of the SRU,
''takes the hypocrisy out of the game.'' What, however, does it put in
its place?
Already Mr McLeod has stated, and would have the support of his
committee, that Scotland does not wish to see transfer fees being paid.
That's fine. But how do you stop them? What would be the position if
England or Wales decide transfers are a grand idea and offer Scottish
players inducements to join them?
It has happened, believe me. Are these players to be barred from
selection for Scotland? Then there is the ''win bonus.'' I am certain
the SRU would frown on that practice as well.
Even so, in an ''open'' sport, it must be perfectly legal for a
sponsor, or a rich local businessman, to put up an added incentive for
success in a big match. Indeed, how are we now to prevent clubs being
bought and sold like any other commodity? Club constitutions can be
changed just as easily as that of the IRFB.
I do not believe for a moment that the current Scottish squad will
attempt to hold the SRU to ransom. They are, collectively, a most
sensible and reasonable bunch of young men.
Yet all of them will know that signing a contract -- and boy, will
there be contracts -- does not come without obligation. The old days of
popping off for a fun weekend with the Saltires or the Wolfhounds, or
maybe even the Barbarians, could become a memory very quickly.
I believe the majority of the Scottish squad would wish to continue
with a career outside rugby. That would be a wise option.
If demands on their time increase, however, will they be able to do
so? If not, will they really be financially better off than they are
now? Players must know where they stand if they are injured playing the
game, whether other perks -- kit, cars, endorsements -- will be treated
as payment in kind by the Inland Revenue, whether there will be any kind
of pension scheme.
On the radio yesterday, I heard a reporter introduce an item by
saying: ''Now that the dust has settled on the proposals for
professional rugby...'' It is not dust, my friend, but a pea-souper of a
fog we are in, and that will take years to dispel.
We have not even covered the arguments about country v club, or even
to whom the players ''belong.'' We do not know whether referees will be
paid, or by whom.
In my time, the distinction between amateurs and professionals has
been swept away in cricket, largely successfully I think, in tennis, and
in athletics.
Despite the vast sums of prize money available, and staging the
world's most prestigous tournament, Britain has yet to produce a single
tennis player to frighten the world. Athletics has to battle every day
against the drug cheats, while it is more rewarding to set a world
record at a sponsored meeting than at the World Championships. And there
are fewer Scottish athletes in UK teams then ever I can recall.
How long, I wonder, before rugby is pressurised by television
companies, into changing the laws to suit the programmes? I hope the
players do well in the brave new world we have entered. I hope, too,
that the efforts of all the backroom people are recognised -- the club
secretaries, the medics, the physios, the touch judges, the selectors,
the blokes who travel with the fourth XV. And I hope these folk still
feel it is worth their while to be involved.
Maybe we are just getting old, Neil, but I have yet to be convinced we
will have a better game in 10 years' time.

ATHLETICS
IT took 50 years for Japan to make public apology for events of the
Second World War. But Aussie swimmer Dawn Fraser was 19 years quicker.
During the Tokyo Olympics, Fraser was one of a trio who liberated the
Rising Sun from the flagpole at Emperor Hirohito's palace. Now, at the
World Student Games in Fukuoka, sprinter Fraser has returned a flag to
the Japanese: ''as a gesture of goodwill,'' she says.
The Aussies -- gold medal for diplomacy -- have made former Olympic
champion Fraser patron of their team.
Fraser, banned from world swimming as a result of the prank (the two
men who accompanied her kept quiet and escaped punishment) has retained
the original, auctioning it to raise funds for disabled Olympic
sportsmen.
Flying the sporting flag is often a painful experience, as Doug
Walker, in Japan, and Yvonne Murray in Lanarkshire, testified yesterday.
Edinburgh sprinter Walker, sole Scot in the UK track team in Fukuoka,
safely negotiated the opening two rounds of the 200 metres. Walker, who
has needed intensive back treatment since arriving in Japan, races the
semi-finals and, hopefully, final today.
Motherwell's Murray, meanwhile, has had a weight removed from her mind
by a 20-stone chiropractor. Now, relieved of sciatic pain, she travels
to the Berlin grand prix on Friday, and a 5000 metres world record
attempt by world champion Sonia O'Sullivan, more composed than at any
time this season.
''My physio, David Mclean, was nursing me along, but I did not wish to
admit even to myself that I had a problem,'' confessed Murray. ''I don't
like letting negative thoughts into my head. But the truth is that I
have not been able to get on my toes to sprint.''
Murray however will need to be exceptionally sharp when she faces
O'Sullivan and the current world record holder, Fernanda Ribiero.
O'Sullivan is chasing a possible #165,000 in gold bullion.
Melanie Neef may lose her place in the German event thanks to the
return of reinstated drug cheat Grit Breur. The suspension on the former
world junior 400m champion, banned along with Katrin Krabbe for using
the annabolic and stimulant agent, clenbuterol, expires tomorrow, and
Neef's lane may go to German.

ADAM Homes was sure potential buyers visiting its new #6.5m
development of luxury flats and villas in Bearsden would be impressed.
And they were. The feedback has been more than favourable, with the
first apartments selling so quickly there hasn't been time to establish
a showflat. Then came the villas -- which sparked a similar, and
continuing, demand from buyers.
Now the luxury housebuilder is delighted to have further, concrete
confirmation of its achievements on the site in the form of a
prestigious National House-Building Council award.
Site manager James Harkins has been selected to receive a Quality
Award in this year's UK Pride In the Job competition, established by the
NHBC to foster quality in construction and reward commitment to quality
workmanship.
''I am absolutely delighted James has been chosen for this award,''
said David Nelson, managing director of Adam (Scotland). ''Henderland
Gate has been complimented by the general public and visitors throughout
this summer, and now this award indicates that their enthusiasm is
shared by the construction industry, and there is no higher authority in
house building than the NHBC.''
In fact the combination of the site -- in tranquil surroundings just
off the Switchback in Bearsden, with splendid views over the surrounding
area to the Erskine Bridge and Clyde estuary -- and Adam Homes' unique
House Exchange Plan is proving one which discerning house buyers are
finding hard to refuse.
Billed as the brave new world of house-buying, the deal removes
clients' fears about being unable to sell their existing home and
guarantees they simply cannot lose. The only ''catch'' is the
customer's: a brand-new luxury home.
But time is running out, as David Nelson explains: ''There are still a
few days left if anyone wants to take advantage of this successful
summer offer before we head into autumn, which is traditionally one of
the busiest seasons for house builders.''
Under the exchange plan, after reserving one of the villas the
client's own home is valued by an independent valuer and a mutually
acceptable minimum part-exchange price is agreed with Adam.
Once missives for the purchase of the new home are concluded, the
seller's property will be marketed by a leading estate agent, with all
advertising costs and agent fees to be borne by Adam. Should the
property be sold for more than the agreed minimum value, the seller
keeps all the proceeds. Should it sell for less, or not at all, Adam
will still pay the agreed minimum price in part exchange for the new
home.
''We've been delighted with the response. We are giving the client the
confidence to go ahead and put their house on the market because we are
picking up the estate agents' fee and advertising and providing a
minimum fall-back. It's a no-lose situation,'' said David Nelson.
''People are worried about spending weeks and weeks advertising with
the costs going up, worried about two mortgages. What we are doing is
underpinning that. We are saying we will take it on the chin.''
The development comprises a range of two and three-bedroom flats (28
in all) and 15 four and five-bedroom detached homes. All are built to
the highest standards, offering exceptionally spacious accommodation and
a very high level of specification. People have moved into the first
phase of flats, finished recently, and work is now under way on the
second phase.
''The flats have been selling so quickly that we haven't had time to
have a showflat, but we do have a completed flat which people can look
round.''
On the house front, the first residents have also begun to move in.
The show home, a five-bedroom Carnoustie detached villa with interior
design by Decorum of Sauchiehall Street, opened in March.
The rooms are generally much larger than usual, and the double doors
into the lounge, the patio doors in the dining room, the generous
hallways on both ground and upper level, the large ensuites, and the
extensive landscaped gardens all serve to give a feeling of space. A
choice of stylish bathrooms and fully equipped quality kitchens --
designed to maximise on space and storage -- are included in the price.
''Another reason for the continued popularity is the amount of space
in these flats and houses,'' said David Nelson. ''In the five-bedroom
house, for example, even the fifth bedroom can take a double bed, and
all the kitchens -- even those in the flats -- have been designed to
take a table for dining. All of the flats have balconies leading off
from the lounge, most with a view.''
Each flat is supplied with satellite television, and there is an
aerial point in every room. The villas have living flame fireplaces and
patios leading to the gardens, and the developers offer a carpets and
curtains package.
Henderland Gate is close to shopping and transport facilities as well
as being within easy reach of the city centre. Prices are from #98,000
for a two-bedroom flat and from #198,000 for the Braemar four-bedroom
detached villa.
''We think we have a winning package at Henderland Gate, and James's
award is a real bonus when you consider that the NHBC is the premier
standard setting and warranty organisation for the UK house-building
industry,'' said David Nelson.

SCOTTISH champion Peter Nicol, who underwent a tonsil operation in
June, faces a stiff test of his fitness when he opens his season against
former British title-holder Paul Gregory in today's first round of the
Cathay Pacific Perrier Open in Hong Kong.
The operation was a success, but the world No.4 did miss several
weeks' summer training and has not played since the Champion of
Champions in early June.
''I'm a bit short of match practice, and it's a tough draw,'' said
Nicol, who goes on to compete in the JSM Classic in Japan next week.
Nicol is in the same quarter as Simon Parke, winner of last week's
Malaysian Open, and the same half as world No.1 Jansher Khan.
Neil Harvey, Nicol's London-based coach, regards this as the start of
the build-up to the World Open in Cyprus in November. He said: ''I'll be
delighted if Peter reaches the semi-finals this week.''

IN ENGLAND
DAVID Platt will undergo surgery tomorrow to repair a torn cartilage
in his right knee and he will miss England's match against Colombia next
week as well as at least two Premiership games.
Arsenal manager Bruce Rioch revealed Platt's injury after the midfield
player scored a fine goal in the 1-1 Highbury draw against Nottingham
Forest.
''He did it in training the day before we played Inter-Milan in a
pre-season friendly three weeks ago, and now we are going to lose him
for two games at least, although the doctors say he could be back in
training inside 10 days,'' said Rioch.
The game stated well for the Gunners with Platt's strike, but Kevin
Campbell, who left Arsenal for Nottingham Forest in the summer for
#2.5m, notched his first goal since December from a pass by Scot Gemmill
after 63 minutes.
And two minutes from time, the Highbury reject almost grabbed a
glorious winner, forcing keeper David Seaman to save from a fiercely
struck volley. It did not look like Campbell's night when he missed a
golden opportunity in the first half, driving the ball against Seaman
when clear.
Bryan Roy missed a similar opportunity but it took a spectacular
effort from Platt to put Arsenal's noses in front three minutes before
the interval. Good work by Ray Parlour got the ball out to the flank for
Lee Dixon, whose cross was volleyed home by Platt.

<HEADLINE>Bruno ready for 'demon' McCall</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANK Bruno and Oliver McCall had the gloves off yesterday, in a
verbal sense, when they met at the National Maritime Museum in
Greenwich.
Bruno was upset that the American referred to his mother, wife, and
children during the build-up to Saturday's WBC heavyweight title clash
at Wembley. ''To bring my family into it is not right,'' said the
Englishman. ''He is a disgrace as champion, he's a demon.
''I can't wait to fight, I can't wait to put my fist in his face and
shove all those words down his throat.''
The crossfire was music to promoter Don King's ears, but the hatred
looked genuine, with McCall having more to say than Bruno. At one stage
Bruno countered as McCall went into full verbal attack: ''Cool it,
that's libellous, man.''
McCall seized quickly on Bruno's three stoppages in previous
world-title fights against Tim Witherspoon, Mike Tyson, and Lennox
Lewis. The champion said: ''To say: 'I'm going to beat him like my
father used to' makes my father sound like a child-abuser. If he has his
way and makes me look bad, losing to someone with no fighting skills,
winning is not going to make him look any better because he'll be
knocked down in his first defence.
''You have no skills, all you have is rap. You don't have nothing. I
don't even consider you beating me. It's like thinking you'll go to hell
when you die. I'll be going to heaven.''
Bruno claimed: ''It's quite simple. I'm going to knock him out. What
he is saying is all hype -- it means nothing. I'm not going to get on
this bandwagon. What I want to do is add a bit of class to the
heavyweight division. I'm grateful. I'm going to seize the moment.''
* ULSTERMAN Ray Close has had his hopes of fighting for the world
title dented by the British Boxing Board of Control. He was refused
permission to box Chris Eubank for a third time in February after
failing a CT scan. He has now received the all-clear in Ireland, but
that is not enough to satisfy the BBBC.
The former European super-middleweight champion returns to the ring on
September 9 in Cork on the Eubank-Steve Collins bill but has been
refused permission to box anyone from Britain.  An opponent for him has
still to be named.

A SPORTY runabout, 14ft on the centreline, which goes behind the
smallest family car, contradicts the popular conception that boating is
for the rich. The Capri 1401 LS from Bayliner could be yours brand new
for #5995, including VAT. It takes four people back-to-back style, so is
handy for ski-towing, and has a galvanised trailer and 50hp outboard.
''I keep telling people that boating is not a rich man's sport,'' says
Stan Prosser, at Blochairn. ''Give people what they want. The right
boat, the right financing, the right guarantee. That's good business.''
The range is impressive too. Sports boats and cruisers from Bayliner,
Cruisers Inc and Bravo in the US, a trailable 16ft cabin cruiser from
Quayline in England and an interesting line in luxury cruisers from NB
Marine of Norway.
Moneywise, you can go all the way from a second-hand craft at #2500 to
a lottery winner's #200,000 super-duper dream boat. Stylewise, take the
14ft Capri, it's fine for swishing around in Loch Lomond, or off a quiet
coastline. Two seats face forward and two aft keep an eye on a skier.
There's an integral fuel tank, windscreen, instrumentation, lights, and
smooth inviting lines. An introductory model, if you like, leading to
the larger Trophy and then the Classic cruiser options.
These may well be for the fisher fanciers, with centre consoles and
protected cabins. There are other models that take more interest in
sleeping space and sunbridges, more in the family leisure mode.
Reach the motoryacht dream-line and this is big boat territory, with a
45ft or 47ft cruiser to play with. By now you can expect to get a flat
bowsprit construct -- really an extended pulpit -- to deal with
anchoring. Stereo systems, autopilots, radar, staterooms, home-from-home
galleys. If you pay more, you get more.
It's much the same idea with the Cruisers fleet. Their 42-footer
provides an adjustable helm seat and tilt wheel on the bridge just to
make sure you're comfy. Engine options go to 435hp or thereby. The
microwave oven is merely one part of a huge galley, and the television
is a built-in component of the integral entertainment centre.
With the Bravo line, we can go back to the sports boat concept. Speed
and style is of the essence. Getting on the plane is important and it
needn't preclude a stern swim platform, carpeting, or sport seating.
Typically, there is going to be rack and pinion steering, an automatic
bilge pump, power trim, drink holders, and ski storage among standard
features. You can add ice chests, a quick-plane extended hull, and gold
nitrate plated emblems if you choose.
Being able to trail a smaller boat on holiday makes sense for the
young family. Being able to trade in a runabout for a cruiser or fisher
suits the growing family. And those who have made it in business terms
can indulge their fantasies with whatever is biggest and best on the
market.
The real point is that a wide range of tastes, and expectations, can
be catered for today. First-time buyers have to be welcomed to boating,
encouraged to have a go, and looked after properly. That includes
judicious advice on safety at sea, basic boat handling if necessary, and
programmed maintenance needs.
''As far as I'm concerned, it covers finance, a parts and labour
guarantee -- our own one, no loopholes -- boat delivery, supervised
handover, and good insurance rates as well. Really, everything the
customer wants and is entitled to get,'' says Stan Prosser.
''This is a highly competitive business. I'm competitive and I take
this business very seriously. We'll be selling a total of 400 boats this
year, and that makes us one of the biggest marine traders in the whole
of the UK.
''As I say, go for down-to-earth prices, for down-to-earth people. And
that gets them down to the sea as well,'' he adds. ''That's what it's
about -- customer satisfaction.''

US OPEN TENNIS
STEFFI Graf, the No.1 seed, regained her composure after having lost
the opening set to beat Amanda Coetzer 6-7 (1-7), 6-1, 6-4 and move into
the second round of the US Open in New York yesterday.
At first, Graf's game was full of errors but the South African's play
was not without flaw and she needed nine set points to take the lead.
Graf was in danger of becoming the first top-seeded woman to fall in
the first round since seedings began in 1922. But she found the range on
her ground-strokes, especially the forehand, and Coetzer began to hit
more errors. Graf closed out the tie on her second match point, gaining
revenge for her only defeat so far this year.
One seeded player did fall, with Austrian Barbara Paulus beating No.13
Iva Majoli, of Croatia, 6-4, 6-4.
Seeds advancing included the No.4, Conchita Martinez of Spain, Czech
Jana Novotna, seeded fifth, Kimiko Date of Japan (7), American Lindsay
Davenport (10), Germany's Anke Huber (11), Natasha Zvereva, of Belarus
(12), American Mary Joe Fernandez (14) and Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of
Holland (16).
In the men's event, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi had easy successes,
Agassi defeating hard-serving Bryan Shelton 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, while Sampras
brushed Fernando Meligeni aside 6-0, 6-3, 6-4.
Agassi was ranked only No.20 for last year's tournament as he battled
back from wrist surgery and made the adjustment to his new coach, Brad
Gilbert. Since then, the flamboyant American has posted an amazing 88-10
match record, including 20 wins in a row.
Another British player, Chris Woodruff, went out, beaten 6-4, 7-6
(7-5), 6-4 by Australian Todd Woodbridge.
Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, seeded No.7, defeated Jeff Tarango,
playing in his first match since being defaulted at Wimbledon, 6-0, 6-4,
7-5. The No.13 seed, Marc Rosset, of Switzerland, the No.9, Swede Thomas
Enqvist, and Spain's Sergi Bruguera, seeded No.11, also went through.
* SCOTLAND'S Donald Watt opened his bid for the men's singles title at
the British over-35 championship in Eastbourne with a convincing 6-0,
6-3 win over Hertfordshire's Keith Abbott yesterday.

STERLING had a mixed tone in late European trading. In the absence of
fresh factors the pound is expected to mirror movements elsewhere.
Yesterday with volumes still light in the summer holiday season, the
pound added 0.1 on its trade-weighed index to 84.6. It was almost a
third-of-a-cent better than the dollar at $1.5453 and is expected to
remain above $1.5400.
Despite a weaker German mark, sterling slipped more than
half-a-pfennig to DM2.2740. The mark succumbed to profit-taking in the
wake of sharp gains against the French franc on Monday. This followed
the surprise resignation of Finance Minister Alain Madelin.
Elsewhere, the Italian lira continued to do well and the Spanish
peseta remained steady.

A SURVEY of 50 leading companies by Arthur Andersen showed that none
complied fully with the recommendations of the Greenbury report on
boardroom pay and many had a long way to go.
The international firm of accountants analysed the latest annual
reports of 50 of the UK's top 250 companies and found the average level
of compliance with the Greenbury code was only 31%.
The biggest companies came out better than smaller ones, but the
degree of compliance varied greatly from sector to sector.
Privatised energy companies had a relatively good compliance rate of
50%, but the financial sector came off worst with only 13%.
Many of the annual reports analysed were published before the
committee headed by Marks &amp; Spencer chairman Sir Richard Greenbury
announced its recommendations on directors' pay and conditions in July.
But Arthur Andersen said they all came out at time when disclosure was
already major issue and there was strong public awareness of many of the
best practice points highlighted by Greenbury.

SHEFFIELD entrepeneur Stephen Hinchcliffe, head of the retail group
Facia, is further expanding his fast-growing empire with the acquisition
of 245 shoe shops from the British Shoe Corporation, it was announced
yesterday.
The disposal by the British Shoe Corporation, part of the Sears group,
of its Freeman Hardy Willis, Trueform and Manfield stores has been made
at a loss ''in the region of #16m'', said Sears in a statement, although
no value was put on the sale.
But it added that the deal would allow it to focus on a small number
of competitive brands -- Shoe Express, Hush Puppies, Shore Connection,
Dolcis and Shoe City.
''The advantages to BSC of managing this simpler portfolio will be
felt throughout the business and, in particular, will allow us to review
again during the remainder of this year the level of fixed costs
required to support this simplified structure,'' said Sears' chief
executive Liam Strong.
Under the deal, Facia said it would acquire assets worth more than
#11m and take on no liabilities. It will also move its head office from
Sheffield to London.
It will add #75m to annual sales, taking group sales to more than
#250m and the number of stores to approximately 800.
The deal comes almost exactly one year after Facia was formed to
acquire Salisbury's, the luggage store, from Signet Group.
Since then the company has become the second largest independent
retailer in the country.

EVEN before George Kynoch, MP, Scottish Office Minister for Industry
and Local Government, officially opens Scottish Water '95, the two-day
event is well on the way to success.
Now in its second year, the National Water &amp; Wastewater Exhibition in
the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Glasgow, which opens at
10am on Wednesday, September 6, has attracted so many major exhibitors
-- over 120 at the last count -- that it has been moved into the
centre's 2100 square metre Hall 5, and is an acknowledged sell-out.
Scottish Water '95 is organised by International Trade Publications
(ITP) Ltd, publishers of the magazine Water Services and part of Argus
Business Media Ltd which, with a current portfolio of 36 exhibitions, is
a major international exhibition organiser in its own right.
ITP Ltd also publishes Water &amp; Environment International and the Water
Services Year Book and, as a company, is totally committed to the water
industry.
With this dedicated background, bearing in mind that Water Services is
a long established and respected UK water industry title dating back to
1899, Scottish Water '95 is a precisely targeted event organised with
water industry professionals and manufacturing industry environmental
managers in its sights. It is the perfect showcase for the most
up-to-date quality equipment and technology available.
Last year Scottish Water '94 attracted more than 1000 chief decision
makers, a senior level turn-out from the Scottish River Purification
Boards, regional councils and manufacturing industry. Once again the aim
is to attract the most influential buyers and specifiers from regional
councils' senior water industry, plant, project and systems managers and
engineers; the Scottish River Purification Boards' senior pollution
control managers and officers, scientists and laboratory personnel; the
manufacturing industry's plant managers, environmental control managers
plus directors and managers responsible for effluent treatment and
environmental controls as well as water companies, contractors,
consultants and process engineers.
Roy Greenslade, managing director of ITP Ltd, the exhibition's
organisers, said: ''The event attracted top drawer members of the water
industry north of the Border. Now that we are in Scotland's No1
exhibition venue, where we have been able to accommodate an even greater
number of quality exhibitors than before, we are confident that
representatives of the regional councils, the River Purification Boards,
manufacturing industry and independent consultants will make it a
priority to attend.
This year's exhibitors are very conscious that the Scottish Water
industry is advancing with an expensive and technologically ambitious
water and sewerage programme which will result in a collective spend of
over #1bn over the next five years to meet the stringent new national
and EC water and wastewater laws.
At the same time, Scotland's manufacturing industry, including
petrochemicals, paper-making, brewing, distilling and electronics, is
under even tighter scrutiny from the powerful River Purification Boards
as they clamp down on polluters.
With suppliers to the industry all competing for the business of the
three new public water authorities, the standard of exhibition and
display at Scottish Water '95 is geared to be high.
Companies exhibiting know that it all adds up to creating a
challenging high-value market for suppliers of water and wastewater
treatment and management products and services.
The new European wastewater legislation which became law in Scotland
in 1990 has resulted in major and ongoing changes. With substantial
investment being made by the reorganised local authorities in new
equipment technologies and services, Scottish Water '95 is the ideal
shop window for providers.
The exhibition is dedicated to practical water and wastewater
solutions and is committed to attracting key Scottish buyers and
specifiers. All regional council water departments will also have stands
at the exhibition. So important is this water industry shop window for
Scotland that one company, MCS Measurement and Control Systems, hopes to
be celebrating the opening of its new Scottish premises at the show.
Over September 6 and 7, Scottish Water '95 is set to provide a
valuable and unique industry forum for those involved in the water and
wastewater industry. It is appropriate that the premier exhibition of
its type is taking place this year in the SECC. It is easily reached
from main roads into the city and there is secure car parking with over
3000 spaces.

CHAMBERS dictionary describes Allan Pinkerton (1819-1884) as an
American detective. But as mosts Scots know, the Colt-45-toting,
duster-raincoated scourge of Wild West outlaws, was actually from
Glasgow's Gorbals, forced to flee these shores after a warrant was
issued for his arrest because of his involvement in Chartism, the
19th-century movement to bring political power to the lower classes.
From next month though it is the Edinburgh baddies who had better
watch out as the Pinkerton mob opens its second Scottish office.
''It's ironic really that Glasgow was the last major city in the UK to
have a Pinkerton office,'' said Bill Dunne, the company's director for
Scotland.
''The time had to be right for us to return to Scotland as it would
have been unimaginable to fail in our founder's home town, but I'm
pleased to say that since we opened our first Scottish office in January
1993, our annual Scottish turnover has exceeded #3m.''
The Edinburgh office of Pinkerton Security Services, now a major
player in the world security industry, will be on the corner of London
Road and Easter Road. The company has already won a number of east coast
contracts including Scottish Widows, the Edinburgh International
Conference Centre and the US Consulate -- a far cry from young
Pinkerton's first American client, an unknown, newly qualified solicitor
by the name of Abraham Lincoln who worked for the Illinois railway
company.
When Lincoln was inaugurated President, he remembered the young
Scotsman and asked him to set up the American Secret Service during the
Civil War.
''Just about everyone knows of Pinkerton's legendary chases involving
the likes of Jesse James and Billy the Kid,'' said Mr Dunne, but it
should also be remembered that he was responsible for the introduction
of US federal law.
''A lot of people think that it was J Edgar Hoover who formed the FBI,
but it was Pinkerton who planted the roots for both the FBI and the
CIA.''
Today, the company has offices throughout Continental Europe and the
US, and recently opened branches in Russia and China.
The posse today consists of 55,000 people and the rewards amount to an
annual worldwide turnover in excess of #1000m.

FUND manager Gartmore's revenue in the first half of 1995 was little
changed at #42.6m against #42.4m for the same period last year, but
there has been a decline from #17.4m to #16.2m at the pre-tax level with
operating expenses up by 9% to #28.2m, writes CHRIS STONE.
The company warned in March at the time of its 1994 results -- which
had profits 29% ahead from #27.3m to #35.3m despite volatile stock
market conditions around the world -- that the need to make significant
investments in systems and staff would weigh on profitability this year.
This investment is mainly to support the development of the company's
international client base, currently below 20%. However, the market was
not impressed with the flat revenue performance and the shares dipped 6p
to 212p at the close having lost 11p at one stage.
Fees earned on funds under management did increase on the back of new
business won and higher world securities markets, but this was offset by
reduced income from sales of unitised funds and the launch of new
products.
Gartmore gained new funds under management of #1300m during the period
which, together with market movements contributed to an increase in
funds under management of 12% from #20.8bn at December 31 to #23.3bn at
June 30. New business was particularly strong in UK pension fund
management but the momentum slowed as the period progressed.
Chairman Paul Myners also reported that retail investment sentiment
remained subdued with net sales of UK authorised unit trusts down to
#38m compared to #62m in the first half of 1994. He made the point,
though, that this experience was rather better than the industry as a
whole.
Net sales of #29m by Capital Strategy Fund, Gartmore's main offshore
fund, were also down from the #35m chalked up in the same period last
year.
As part of its higher overseas profile strategy, Gartmore recently
established a joint venture with NationsBank of the US -- Nations
Gartmore Investment Management. It is developing plans to establish a
wholly owned investment management subsidiary in Tokyo.
At present, Japanese investment inquiries are managed through Indosuez
Gartmore Asset Management (Japan), a company jointly owned with
Paris-based Banque Indosuez, which still retains 75% of Gartmore having
floated off 25% at the end of 1993. However, Gartmore's interest in this
company is to be sold at book value to another member of the Banque
Indosuez group.
For the moment, Gartmore is being constrained by additional costs as
it gears itself for new business opportunities, and profits, of course,
are also linked to the level of world share markets.
The interim dividend is held at 1.75p on earnings per share down from
5.6p to 5.2p.

THE merger between two of America's largest banks, Chase Manhattan and
Chemical which will have combined assets of $300bn, has direct
implications here not least because it will lead to the loss of several
hundred jobs.
Like other banks operating in global wholesale money markets, the two
have built extensive operations in the City of London over the past
decade or so and now employ 2150 between them. Chase's international
custody operations are based in Bournemouth where it has 1500 staff,
making it one of the town's largest employers.
Chemical has a similar operation in Cardiff with 200 people. Overall,
the merger will lead to the loss of 12,000 jobs worldwide out of a total
of 76,000, representing about 16%. This would equate to about 600 here,
though a spokesman cautioned against making a straight calculation,
adding that the effects of the merger had not been worked out yet. There
is also considerable staff turnover so compulsory redundancies may be
much lower than this figure.
As in so many things it is tempting to believe that what happens in
the US will soon happen here, but in the case of banks this looks
unlikely. For a start, the industry has developed differently in the UK
-- it is already highly concentrated here whereas it is fragmented in
the US as a result of a ban on inter-state banking.
Bank of Scotland and TSB are sometimes thought vulnerable to a
takeover but it is hard to see what a predator could bring to Bank of
Scotland, for example, given the goodwill cost of such a pillar of
Scottish business. It is also 32% owned by Standard Life which would not
sell in a hurry.
Mergers between the big clearing banks can be virtually ruled out
because of monopoly considerations. The Office of Fair Trading simply
couldn't allow a further concentration of ownership. But other factors
at work will make it vitally necessary for all banks to keep driving
their costs down which before long is likely to prompt another round of
branch closures.
Cost-cutting is the over-riding reason for the Chase and Chemical
union, as it has been in the wave of mergers among smaller US banks this
year. Chemical will emerge on top, with its managers in key positions in
the combined enterprise and its shareholders having 55% of the equity.
Chemical has come up fast, having merged with Manufacturers Hanover in
1991, and it will now top Citicorp to become the biggest US bank.
However, Chase has a major consolation prize in that it will provide the
name of the enlarged group.
US banks have recovered well this decade from the poor-quality lending
debacles of the eighties, greatly helped by the Federal Reserve Board
which ensured that long-term rates fell less quickly than short-term so
the banks could profit from the differential. Now the sector is strongly
capitalised.
So the merger certainly doesn't indicate financial weakness. But it
does reflect shrinking earnings growth opportunities and increasing
competition. The slowing US economy has curtailed loan demand and
devices such as share buy-backs have run their course. Earnings can be
kept moving by achieving economies of scale and rationalisation after
merger.
Competition is coming from non-traditional areas. Financial services
companies such as Fidelity have moved from fund management to
stockbroking to money market accounts with cheque books, and other
services are sure to follow. Then there are the software giants like
Microsoft eyeing electronic banking.
Without the deadweight of a branch network such companies promise to
pose as much of a competitive challenge as the direct insurers have done
to traditional insurance companies with branches and sales forces.
However, in the UK the main action as far as consolidation is
concerned will involve the building societies where a lot more corporate
activity lies in store as mutuality is abandoned and over-capacity in
stagnant mortgage markets forces rationalisation.

FINDING insurance against infertility for expensive pedigree rams will
now be almost impossible following the news that a leading Scottish firm
of brokers is to withdraw from the market after heavy losses.
A spokesperson for the broker, who wants to remain anonymous, said
that recently claims of #45,000 had been settled against the premium
income of only #3000 and that no underwriter was prepared to look at
this aspect of livestock insurance.
The NFU Mutual, which has also provided cover against infertility, is
''urgently reviewing the situation'', but will still look at each
individual case ''on its merits''. However, a spokesperson for the
Mutual said she thought it was more than likely it would also pull out
of the market.
The final event at which the Scottish broker offered cover was last
month's sale of pedigree Suffolks in Edinburgh, where a new record price
of 68,000 guineas was set. The broker explained that in the past it had
only been the more expensive rams which were insured against
infertility.
He also explained that if breeders were serious in seeking cover it
should be a matter for individual breed societies to initiate a scheme
under which all rams sold at official sales were automatically covered.
This, he said, would provide sufficient premium income to cover any
losses.
Most breed societies currently have a fertility guarantee, which in
the case of the Suffolk Society says that a ram has four months to prove
himself by putting just one ewe in lamb. The society's rules state that
this period can be extended by both the seller and buyer entering into a
written agreement.
If at the conclusion of the trial period the ram is still infertile
the seller must refund the full purchase price plus any expenses, but
there is no allowance made for consequential loss.
When cover was available the cost was in the region of #500 for a
#10,000 ram. Cover for death alone runs at 12.5% so the same ram would
cost #1250 to insure for a full year. Recently there have been rumours
that a larger than usual number of high priced Suffolk rams were
infertile when tested after the Edinburgh sale.
However, Dr Bill McKelvie of SAC said this was not the case.
''Absolutely not, I have seen most of the top priced Suffolks and I have
to say that in the main fertility is very good.''
However, he did add that following the stress involved at sale time
some rams might not be 100% fertile, but that after a period of two or
three weeks they would be back to normal.

AYRSHIRE farmers have donated more than 200 prime lambs, 40 breeding
sheep, 100 beef calves, 60 store cattle and 30 pedigree cattle for a
charity auction to be held on Saturday in aid of the Hansel Village at
Symington.
The auction will be held at James Craig's new cattle market at
Whitefordhill, by Ayr, and the proceeds will go towards the #500,000
redevelopment of Wilson House, one of the Hansel's residential units.
A similar event was held 32 years ago when comedian Bob Monkhouse and
radio and TV personality Ted Moult help to raise #20,000 for the
building of a new residential unit, still known as Farmers House.
Judith Young, one of the organisers, said: ''We hope the public will
turn out in force to support the auction and all the other attractions
which will be laid on to make it an all-round family day.''

UNITED Distillers has completed its withdrawal from the lower end of
the US spirits market, selling two US distilleries and a 37 brand names
to Barton Inc, a subsidiary of the fast-growing Canandaigua Wine
Company.
The deal also provides for United Distillers to sell bulk Scotch
whisky to Barton for several years and for Barton to continue packaging
United Distillers products in the United States.
United Distillers, a subsidiary of Guinness, will receive a total
consideration of $171m, part of which will be paid in future years
against bulk whisky shipments.
The company declined to detail the value or volume of these bulk
whisky sales.
United Distillers tried to boost its presence at the bottom end of the
US spirits market in 1991, when it bought Glenmore Distillers for $161m.
The acquisition made it the third-largest player in the US market with
a 14% market share.
But a policy reversal came two years later when it sold 70 minor US
brands to Heaven Hill for an undisclosed sum to concentrate on premium
brands instead.
The Barton deal completes United Distillers' exit from the lower end
of the US market and gets rid of most of Glenmore's remaining assets.
But the UK company has hung on to the jewel in the Glenmore crown --
Scoresby whisky, which is America's top-selling locally bottled Scotch.
Scoresby, which sells just under one million cases per year, ranks
number four overall in the US Scotch whisky market after Dewars, Johnnie
Walker Red Label and Johnnie Walker Black Label.
United Distillers managing director Finn Johnsson said the Barton deal
was ''consistent with our strategy of concentrating our efforts on
premium high-priced brands with long-term growth prospects.''
Alan Gray, whisky analyst with Edinburgh stockbroker Sutherland and
Partners, welcomed the move.
He and other analysts said it showed that Mr Johnsson was making his
mark on United Distillers after taking over as managing director in
February.
''I was surprised by the acquisition of Glenmore in 1991 which took
United Distillers into the lower end of the market at a time when they
were emphasising their commitment to brand building,'' Mr Gray said.
''Withdrawal from this end of the market makes it look as if it was an
area they should not have gone into. Hopefully it marks a return to
concentration on quality brands,'' he added.
Among the cheap brands sold to Barton are the US rights to Inver House
Scotch and the popular vodkas Fleischmann and Skol. Barton also takes
over the Glenmore distilleries and bottling plants at Owensboro,
Kentucky, and Albany, Georgia.
The brands sold generated $231m of gross sales last year and $19m of
operating income. In volume terms they represented about five million
cases of spirits.
Guinness shares fell 7[1/2]p to 493[1/2]p, but traders said this
reflected a general decline in blue chips rather than negative reaction
to the Barton deal.

AH, BLISS! When I came through from Glasgow to Edinburgh on an early
train today the whole Central Belt was covered in a thick and thoroughly
satisfying Scotch mist, lightened only by the infernal fires of
Grangemouth.
It was a huge relief after what is always the worst weekend of the
year, the last in August, when the flood of tourists swells to a
torrent. With the lemming-like instinct of the English on bank holiday,
waves of them spill over the Border to submerge the capital in their
sweaty selves and their detritus.
The nethermost pit of this Hell is the George Hotel, where luvvies
gather for the Television Festival. As a reactionary, I scorn even to
own an idiot-box, so have no interest in their back-slapping and
glad-handing. But I once let myself be led in by my good friend
''Brute'' Anderson, political editor of the Sunday Express, a son of
Shetland who promised I would detest every minute of it. What was on the
contrary diverting, after I entered in such exalted company, was how
many people pretended to remember who I was: Simon Heffer, to whom I
bear a faint resemblance. At least it meant plenty of free triple
whiskies and, when Brute and I at length meandered out into the
sunshine, he turned to me and said: ''Aye, it's not long till
November.''
Still, even while we long for the clocks to go back and the permafrost
to descend, we might usefully reflect that this has been reckoned a
bumper tourist season. It has by the same token confounded the forecasts
of our tourism experts, who in an earlier report appeared to be warning
that Scotland as a destination was in terminal decline. A review of
strategy should therefore be undertaken, and no doubt more support
should come from the Government: the usual stuff.
Nothing daunted, when Ian Grant, chairman of the Scottish Tourist
Board, was asked how the experts had got things so wrong, he blithely
put it down to the success of his outfit's latest advertising campaign.
It would be interesting to discover what was so much better about this
campaign than all the previous ones.
If I may judge from my own American visitors, they came in complete
ignorance of what to expect. The North-east of the United States is not
exactly the end of the world, but they had found it impossible to get
any worthwhile information, and were reduced to phoning me to ask what
books to read. ''Gee, I never guessed you had all this,'' one said as we
drove under a magnificently cloud-capped Ben Loyal. ''I thought Scotland
was just fat men in kilts jerking about with tree trunks.''
So much for projecting Caledonia, stern and wild. I learned besides
that, in contrast to their minds' foggy image of Scotland, my American
guests had believed Ireland to be the most beautiful country in this
quarter of the globe, with rugged mountains, limpid lochs, tinkling
burns etc. Since Ireland is my ancestral home, I know it well, and can
vouch that, apart from a few knobbly bits round the edges, it is flat
and boring in its landscapes, if not in its inhabitants. When we in
Scotland have so much more, I wonder about the long-term efficacy of the
Scottish Tourist Board's advertising campaigns.
I wonder again when I read about some of its future plans, for example
the promotion of native cuisine. Can this be the same Scottish Tourist
Board as was responsible for the ghastly Taste of Scotland, with salmon
swimming in whisky and similar horrors? True, our restaurants have
improved beyond measure in recent times, and we now have some of the
finest country house hotels anywhere, but the best would not touch Taste
of Scotland with a bargepole. We owe them to the dedication and skill of
people such as David Wilson at the Peat Inn, or the Browns at La
Potiniere, or the Allens at Airds, people whose commitment is to quality
rather than gimmicks.
Here is a clue to how the performance of Scottish tourism might be
improved, if indeed it can be improved in the conventional sense, which
is by no means certain. This is not, and never will be, a mass market to
be manipulated by tourist boards. The mass market can fly to Benidorm,
and good luck to it as long as it stays away from me. Given that, we are
foolish to measure success in terms of hordes attracted. We should try
to be not the Spain of the North but the Switzerland of the North, a
place for discerning tourists, above all rich ones, who make up in
spending what they lack in numbers.
To attract them we need more Scots committed to quality rather than
gimmicks. I cannot tell you how to find them, but then Mr Grant of the
Scottish Tourist Board cannot tell you either. They find themselves,
through whatever motivates them. And if they are good at what they do,
they find customers too. This is what we call a free market, and I have
never heard of a free market run by a quango. But it is the way the
world works.
For the remainder of the year we can look forward to Mr Grant's Autumn
Gold campaign. This is surely the last resort. America's fall foliage
attracts tourists, so it must follow -- mustn't it? -- that Scotland can
attract them with a feeble imitation. Let me tell you something,
Scotland's autumn is not golden. It is cold, wet, and miserable, I am
looking forward to it.

AN electronics lecturer at the Glasgow College of Nautical Studies has
alleged that he missed out on promotion because of racial
discrimination.
Mr Ali Liaquat, of Dalry Gardens, Earnock, Hamilton, has worked as an
electronics lecturer at the college since February 1984.
He claims racial discrimination prevented his promotion to senior
lecturer in radio and marine electronics last January.
In his application for a hearing before an industrial tribunal, Mr
Liaquat claimed that ''his qualifications were better than the
successful candidate''.
He also stated that there was a campaign of racial discrimination
against him in 1987 and his promotion had been ''blocked'' and that in
1994 he was again the victim of racial discrimination.
A preliminary determination hearing of the tribunal has ruled that the
alleged acts, prior to those events which culminated in the unsuccessful
application for promotion last January, are themselves time-barred.
However, the tribunal noted: ''In a case of this kind, we are clearly
of the view that there are circumstances in which a limited reference
might be made in evidence to historical matters, without in any sense
regarding such reference as being for the purpose of developing a case
of a continuing act of discrimination.''
A full tribunal hearing will be held at a later date to decide the
issue.

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle director Ian Hannah made nearly #265,000 by
cashing in share options last week, it was yesterday revealed.
His profits from the share dealings are greater than his annual
salary.
Mr Hannah, who is chairman and managing director of the group's retail
division, exercised options to purchase 103,309 shares, at prices
ranging from 225p to 395p, on Friday.
He sold all of these shares, which cost #365,602, on the same day for
#630,185.
Mr Hannah, 52, joined Edinburgh-based Scottish &amp; Newcastle in 1979. He
is a former chairman of The Newcastle Breweries, William Younger and
Thistle Hotels.
At April 30, Scottish &amp; Newcastle's most recent year-end, Mr Hannah
had 153,363 options over Ordinary shares under the company's executive
and savings-related schemes. At that date, 132,443 of these were
exercisable.
No options were exercised by directors under the executive share
option scheme during the 12 months to April 30.
A Scottish &amp; Newcastle official yesterday pointed out that the
company's directors had been unable to sell any shares during the
lengthy closed period relating to the #425m acquisition of Courage from
Fosters Brewing Group, which received the regulatory green light earlier
this month.
She added: ''The sale of these shares was obviously for personal
reasons.''

FISONS, under #1700m bid siege from US-based drugs company
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) which is 68% owned by Rhone Poulenc of France,
yesterday announced the sale of its distribution business to Fisher
Scientific for #201m cash, writes CHRIS STONE.
This comprises the distribution businesses within the the
pharmaceuticals group's laboratory supplies division, Curtin Matheson
Scientific Inc in the US and Fisons Scientific Equipment in the UK.
The agreement, which is subject to obtaining necessary regulatory
consents and the approval of shareholders, is part of the company's
strategy of selling divisions to fund its transformation into a sales
and marketing-dominated operation, a policy already described by RPR as
''high risk''.
Fisons is also in a late stage negotiation with other parties
regarding the sale of US-based J&amp;W Scientific, the remaining business
within the Laboratory Supplies Division. Analysts expect this to fetch
between #30m to #40m.
The sale of the distribution side will be the third major disposal by
the group in the past six months and was generally accepted by the
market as beefing up the company's strength against the RPR bid.
Fisons' chief executive, Stuart Wallis, said: ''It effectively
completes the company's disposal programme and creates a focused
pharmaceutical company with a clear strategy for profitable growth. When
completed, these deals will have generated proceeds of #600m which will
adequately support the continued development of the business.''
RPR's terms of 240p a share represent a valuation of 24 times this
year's estimated earnings, but after disposals earnings will rise next
year and there will also be the company's cash pile.
Given that Fisons' share price at 257[1/2]p, up 2p yesterday, is still
substantially above the bid price the market has felt all along that RPR
would have to offer more. But there does not seem to have been much
questioning of the logic behind the bid, just doubts about whether the
price is right.

THE Environmentally Sensitive Area Scheme, which offers payments of up
to #7000 to farmers who undertake a farm conservation plan, is the most
popular of the five major initiatives which form the Agri-Environment
Programme.
The total area covered in Scotland by the scheme is almost 1.5 million
hectares, representing 19% of the agricultural land, the Farming and
Wildlife Advisory Group said.
Participating farmers and crofters are encouraged to adopt practices
aimed at basic management of environmental features such as heather,
moorland, native woodland, field and waterside margins.
The scheme is generally considered by farmers to be a good one, the
advisory group said. ''There are many positive aspects, including
additional farm income, improved wildlife habitat and enhanced visual
impact.'' It also helps to keep rural communities alive by providing
funds for contract labour for capital projects such as fencing, building
dikes or hedging.
The next most popular programme is the Habitat Scheme which was
launched in November last year. Steady demand is expected, especially if
the land involved is eligible for entry into set-aside. The scheme
requires long-term withdrawal of land from agricultural production in
order to create a range of wildlife habitats. Annual management payments
can go up to #360 a hectare.
One participant is Norman Massie of East Cairnhill, Insch, who is
creating a wetland on a poorly-drained field to attract wading birds
such as snipe, lapwing and redshank.
''I've always had problems with that field, which is difficult to
drain and getting wetter,'' said Mr Massie. ''Now I can manage the site
for the benefit of birds and receive an annual payment of #105 an acre
for 10 years.''
The Organic Aid Scheme has attracted interest mainly in the island
communities of Orkney and on the west coast mainland.
One of the least popular programmes is the Set-Aside Access Scheme --
a five-year agreement under which farmers are paid #90 a hectare for 10
metre wide access strips. Conditions include provision of gates for
access, regular mowing and erection of signposts and fences. ''It all
seems a lot of work for very little return,'' FWAG said.
Bottom of the list comes the Heather Moorland Scheme, which was the
last to be launched. Farmers are entitled to payments in return for
reducing livestock grazing.
* FWAG, under the direction of new chief executive David Ball, has
published advice for farmers on the safe storage and use of manufactured
fertilisers and farmyard manure.
''Heeding the advice in this booklet will save farmers money as well
as safeguarding the environment,'' said the National Rivers Authority,
which co-operated in producing the publication.
The booklet sets out advice on establishing buffer areas at field
edges and making the best use of nutrients in animal manures.

YVE Newbold has one of the highest profiles of any British
businesswoman. She was visible at the top of Hanson when it was less
common to have women in senior positions in major companies, writes
NICOLA REEVES.
As such she is one of the great and good turned to when a woman is
needed to make up the numbers on various panels. She was a member of the
Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. An accomplished public speaker,
she has appeared several times on the BBC's Question Time.
In addition to her work at Hanson, she is a non-executive director of
BT and Coutts Bank and a governor of the London Business School.
She began her career as a lawyer at IBM UK and moved on to Rank Xerox
and Walt Disney.
She has all the trappings of corporate success. She is reputed to earn
#200,000 a year, drives a red Jaguar XJS and owns a house in London's
exclusive Regent's Park.
Despite her success, she does not take herself too seriously and is
supportive of other women who are trying to climb the corporate ladder
elsewhere. She is a member of womens' networks such as Forum and hosts a
monthly breakfast meeting at the Ritz for other senior businesswomen.
Women are very thin on the ground when it comes to directorships of
public organisations but Ms Newbold said that while she was in favour of
more women in the boardroom, they have ''got to earn their spurs''. She
thinks there are still too few women with experience and understanding
of how public companies work.
It is not just more women that she would like to see contributing to
the decision-making of some of our big public organisations, but ''more
of a representation of modern industrial Britain'', that is a wide range
of people of both sexes, all ages and colours.
The younger of two sisters, Yvette Monica Newbold was born in
Southport, Lancashire, on July 6, 1940. After her Belgian father left,
her Irish mother moved the family down to London where she worked on a
magazine. The girls were sent to convent school first in Wales and then
in Brighton.
She differs from many other high powered businesswomen in being
married with children -- three sons and a daughter. She met her husband
at London University where they were both reading law. She had her first
baby at 18 and is particularly close to her daughter, a barrister in the
City. By the age of 27, when she and her husband had both qualified as
solicitors, there were four children.
Her busy life leaves little time for hobbies but she enjoys
fell-walking, jogging and more recently swimming.
Many women find it very difficult to combine raising a family and a
busy professional life. Indeed, Ms Newbold thinks that today's young
women may have got it wrong. Rather than wait until they have
established careers and good salaries, she believes they should get
their child-bearing over as early as possible, then forge ahead with
their career. She herself appears to be an example of that rare breed,
Shirley Conran's superwoman.

FINLAND, which once provided a quarter of Scotland's butter, is set to
elbow its way back into the market after a 20-year absence.
Younger &amp; Melrose, a Glasgow-based distributor of dairy produce, has
signed an agreement to become sole UK distributor of Finland's Midnight
Sun butter, which has not been seen on British supermarket shelves since
the seventies.
Younger &amp; Melrose began importing Finnish butter before the Second
World War and shipments peaked at 25,000 tonnes per year in the early
fifties.
But these imports petered out soon after Britain joined the European
Community in 1973. Neutral Finland, under pressure from the Soviet
Union, stayed out and suffered new tariff barriers on its dairy exports.
The end of the Cold War removed any external constraint on Finland
joining the European Union and last year, even before Finns voted in a
referendum to join the EU, Younger &amp; Melrose got a call from Valio
International, its old supplier in Helsinki, suggesting they resume
business.
Peter Davie, a partner in Younger &amp; Melrose, is proud that his small
family-owned firm beat competition from at least three English companies
to gain Midnight Sun distribution rights for the UK as a whole.
''We are certainly looking for 5% of the UK market within three
years,'' Mr Davie said, adding that sales should build up to 5000 tonnes
a year quite quickly. That would give Younger &amp; Melrose a #20m stake in
Britain's flourishing #400m per year butter market.

INVESTMENT capital group 3i has taken a seven-figure equity stake in
the award-winning Sanmex International, which is heading for a
stock-market listing.
The presence of an institutional investor with a significant minority
shareholding should ease the proposed flotation of the toiletry and
household products group.
Sanmex, which lifted The Herald and accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young's
coveted TrailBlazers award this year, is most likely to opt for the
Alternative Investment Market, the Stock Exchange's recently-launched
market for smaller and growing companies.
It could move on to AIM with a market capitalisation of about #20m.
Depending on the rapidly-expanding company's capital requirements, the
flotation could take place as early as next year.
Alternatively Sanmex may float in 1997, on the back of next year's
results.
Before the investment by 3i, Sanmex, based in Rutherglen, Glasgow, was
100%-owned by the Groden family.
Roy McKelvie, senior investment controller at 3i's Glasgow office, has
been talking to Sanmex for more than two years.
He said: ''It is useful for Sanmex to have a shareholder with deep
pockets which can help to fund its growth.
''A family business which already has an institutional shareholder
will be viewed more positively by the market when we do eventually float
the company.''
Sanmex, which grew in the 1930s providing janitorial supplies to
Glasgow's cinemas and hospitals, was in something of a rut five years
ago.
Its traditional markets were in decline but, unlike some other family
companies, it took radical action to ensure it did not end up as
takeover fodder or, even worse, in the hands of the receiver.
Between 1990 and 1993, Sanmex, which now sells washing-up liquids,
fabric softeners, disinfectants, multi-surface cleaners, and aerosol
toiletry and household products to Tesco, Morrisons and Superdrug,
doubled its turnover to #11.2m.
With an insurance claim having resulted from the loss of one month's
production after December's flooding, the 1994 sales figure is as yet
incomplete.
However, turnover is expected to top #14m this year and approach #18m
next year.
Sales director Norman Ferguson is looking to attract more business as
a result of Kwik Save's expansion north of the Border. The deep-discount
group, which recently acquired Shoprite's Scottish stores, is already a
major customer.
About 180 people are currently employed by Sanmex, which should take
its workforce through the 200-mark during the next few months as it
increases aerosol production.
Sanmex, which manufactures both supermarket own-label and its
proprietary Charm and Dispel brands, exports to between 25 and 30
countries.
Its fly sprays are much in demand in China, while, in the Middle East,
kaftan-wearers find relief in Sanmex's de-static product. Eastern Europe
is a growing market for the company, which also sells to the Caribbean.

YVE Newbold, the high profile company secretary of Hanson, is leaving
at the end of September after nine years, to become chief executive of
Pro-Ned. This is the headhunting organisation which specialises in
finding non-executive directors for public companies. Lord Hanson,
chairman of Hanson, said: ''We are very sorry to lose Yve, but wish her
well in her challenging new role.''
Pro-Ned, founded in 1982, has played a major role in improving the way
in which companies are governed. It was set up by the Bank of England
and has developed from a mainly campaigning role into an employment
agency. In January last year it was sold to a joint venture made up of
the Swiss recruitment firm Egon Zehnder International and its own
management.
The number of companies with non-executive directors has increased
dramatically since Pro-Ned's inception. Ms Newbold, who said she was
''excited'' by the challenge of her new job, feels there is still much
to be done to ensure that the right sort of people get on to boards.
''It can't be the chairman's cousin any more,'' she said. She believes
the calibre of boards is all the more important given the increased
liability and responsibilities which they now face following
investigations by the Greenbury and Cadbury Committees.
Given her successful career to date and comfortable life, 55-year-old
Ms Newbold could have been expected to be considering retirement. Far
from it, this year she felt it was time to seek new challenges and
wanted to be ''more in charge of something of my own, however small''.
She is succeeded at Hanson by Jonathan Azis, a solicitor who has been
with the company as a tax manager since 1992. Ms Newbold's resignation
comes just days after the death of Lord White, the 72-year-old
co-founder of the Anglo-US industrial conglomerate whose UK interests
include Imperial Tobacco, the ARC aggregates business and Seven Seas
Vitamins.

<TEXT>
Bonn, Tuesday -- The strength of the mark and high wage deals earlier
in the year could choke off recovery in the German economy, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said today.
''The main risk (to our forecast), operative from the second half of
this year, is that the double blow of exchange rate appreciation and
high wage settlements could undermine competitiveness, profitability and
business confidence to a greater degree than expected,'' the Paris-based
think-tank for wealthy nations said in its annual report on Germany.
The 25-nation OECD has predicted that Europe's powerhouse economy
would grow by 2.9% this year and 2.7% next.
''In contrast a reversal of the recent exchange rate appreciation
could imply stronger activity, linked to better prospects for exports
and enhanced investor confidence, but in this case inflation would tend
to be higher,'' the report said.
Inflation would stay around 2% but it said unemployment would not
decline significantly in western Germany. ''Recent adverse
competitiveness shifts are likely to maintain the impetus towards
rationalisation in manufacturing,'' it added.
A further risk to the forecast is that people might save more than
they are at present and, therefore, spend less.
It predicted the main factors that had driven the recovery until now
-- housing and exports -- might slow in the second half, but business
investment would take over.
Eastern Germany would remain the fastest growing region in Europe, it
said, aided by double-digit growth in investment. -- Reuter

IT'S all change in the world of rugby football as money not so much
talks but screams at the top of its voice. One piece of sponsorship
which we hope will continue for many years is the deal with Courage, the
brewers, and the English club championship.
Courage have, of course, been taken over by Scottish and Newcastle
Brewers. The resulting merged beer-making outfit is to be called
Scottish Courage.
Which means that, all going well, England's premier rugby tournament
will be called the Scottish Courage Club Championship.

REMEMBER the old People's Labour Party? How it was run by politicans
who had come out of the shipyards, the coal mines, the odd lawyers'
office, or even a classroom?
How different is Tony Blair's New Improved Labour, as epitomised by
one Suzanne L'Estrange of Battersea Constituency Labour Party in London.
Ms L'Estrange is standing for election to the party's national
executive. She is described as a ''recent recruit'' to Labour and has
lived in London for 25 years apart from a brief period ''working as a
goatherd and cheesemaker in France''.
Presumably she is a member still in good standing of the Amalgamated

Beat retreat?
LABOUR'S troubles with geography continue. Our man in Westminster was
summoned by the Opposition to be given ''details of Government plans to
centralise further the control of Britain's police forces''.
It turned out to be not about Britain at all, but merely about England
and Wales. A common mistake among southerners you say -- except that the
senior Labour person chairing the news conference was none other than
Jack Straw, who has been ordered by Tony Blair to redraft the party's
devolution plans.
Those of you hanging about in expectation of a Labour U-turn on
devolution take note.

THAT lovable London duo, the Jamesons, who have brought their skills
north of the Border to broadcast to the nation on Radio 2 of a late
evening, have been dipping into the Edinburgh Festival. Ellen, Mrs
Jameson, took quite a strict line during an interview with dancer Mark
Morris.
How, she asked, could he square the athleticism of his artistic form
with smoking and drinking? Mr Morris said he could see no contradiction.
Mrs Jameson pursued the point at which Mr Morris declared that not
only did he drink and smoke but also he was ''a sodomite''. And he
didn't see how it affected his art. This information seemed to bring
that aspect of the conversation to an end.
Sick story
SEE Strathaven? See showbiz. We read in the Echoes, the weekly journal
which carries all the news fit to print in the aforementioned douce
Lanarkshire burgh, the life story of one Stevie Starr.
His tale is headed ''Brought up in Strathaven'' and begins: ''Famous
professional regurgitator Stevie Starr was brought up from the age of
four months at local children's home Glenavon, however his Strathaven
connections do not stop there.
''Previously known as Stevie Wright, the young boy was swallowing
money by the age of six, much to his friends' horror and excitement. He
then progressed to bumble bees and Cadbury creme eggs.
''Nancy and Bessie, elderly twins who previously worked in the
children's home, recall vividly how Stevie swallowed razor blades and
regurgitated them later . . . Stevie was working in McIvor's butcher
shop, Barn Street. Staff there remember how Stevie used to drink a whole
bottle of lemonade in one gulp.''
A local hotelier, spotting Stevie's talent, bought him a set of stage
clothes and entered him in a talent competition. The rest, as they say,
is history.
Prey on his mind
AN apocryphal story, we hope, from a police court somewhere in the
Highlands where the chap in the dock has been caught red-handed shooting
a capercaillie and then having it for his tea. The magistrate duly
imposes a hefty fine for this transgression of the laws on protected
species and, before sending the miscreant on his way, summons him to the
Bench.
''Tell me,'' says the magistrate, ''what does a capercaillie taste
like?'' ''Well, your honour,'' he replies, ''It's better than the osprey
but not as good as the golden eagle.''
A few regrets
WE asked you some time ago to suggest suitable Japanese Prime
Minister-style apologies. We apologise for taking so long to announce
the winner.
Murray Macmillan of Bridge of Allan wins the whisky for his suggestion
that Bonnie Prince Charlie should apologise for not carrying on to
London -- and tearing down the goalposts at Wembley and lying blootered
in a fountain in Trafalgar Square.

THE lady doth protest too much. That could have been my slogan for the
eighties. If there was something you could get ants in your pants about,
from Nelson Mandela being banged up to massive cuts in the stationery
budget of the university's publications department, I'd be rustling up
placards and womaning (I was that rad a fem) the barricades before you
could say ''Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Out! Out! Out!'' Which we did, quite
loudly at the drop of an authentic Russian Army hat.
I was reminiscing fondly about the good old days last night and
bonding with a new-found friend by sharing a few choruses of the Maggie
chant, to the mild bemusement of those around us who clearly thought we
were trapped in a time warp. Their bemusement was only mild because it
is, after all, Festival Edinburgh and anything goes; we might have been
rehearsing a scene from an agit-prop biting satire on student
radicalism.
A radical approach has been sadly lacking among the few protesters who
have been popping up during the Fringe, lobbying against all things
French and shunning the Perrier awards. They've managed to make me feel
guilty about munching on a Golden Delicious -- and, tsk, me being such a
health-conscious chick that's a big sacrifice -- but their pallid
protests haven't exactly encouraged me to show solidarity and boost
their numbers.
While their professional comrades in Greenpeace have been displaying a
dazzling gung-ho activism, buzzing the French fleet in helicopters and
sailing perilously close to full-scale naval battle, the Edinburgh
entourage are contenting themselves with the politest of objections.
Each morning on my way to the Herald empire in the capital I pass the
group patiently picketing the French Institute and marvel at how wrong
they've got it. For a start they look all shiny and clean when it's a
well-known fact that protesters should favour a grungey fashion
statement, with unkempt garments and matted locks, a look which clearly
announces ''I'm so committed to my cause I don't even have time to go to
the bathroom, let alone iron my togs.'' The people who dwell in trees
who get ratty about motorways have this one sussed, while hunt saboteurs
have it well nigh perfected, obviously holding Arrid Extra Dry in the
same contempt as hunters.
Holding prettily inscribed placards the anti-nuke crowd circle the
Institute with a careful precision which could have been choreographed,
instead of surging around in the tried and tested tradition of the angry
mob. They're even quite quiet, which is simply unforgivable, but worse,
much worse, they're smiling.
This is simply unacceptable behaviour. They nod in a friendly fashion
as I scurry past them when they should clearly be screaming insults in
my wake --''Capitalist, reactionary, militarist bitch -- I hope you
choke on your Golden Delicious.'' They're so un-intimidating it makes me
sick, although I do live in terror, oh horror of horrors, that they will
wish me a nice day.
Where's the fun in being nice to people? What's the point in that? The
biggest kick I ever got out of marching up and down the country in the
eighties was the sheer unadulterated pleasure of turning on interested
bystanders and screaming, to their bewilderment, ''Don't Spectate!
Demonstrate!'' in a snarling froth of righteous fury.
I watched, with weary disdain, someone attempting, and failing
miserably, to get his point across last week. The Hill Street Theatre
cafe had been commandeered, with typical arrogance, by a television crew
doing an ad hoc interview with a member of the Perrier judging panel.
While they filmed the famous-for-15-minutes judgette wittering on
about all the jolly funny people she had been privileged to see, a young
man hovered in the background. I assumed he was trying to tell them
their cappuccinos had arrived. The interview concluded, he dashed up to
the slick trendy female presenter. ''Can I just say a few words about
nuclear testing?'' he asked in chorister tones. ''No you can't,'' she
snapped, strutting off in killer stilettos. ''Oh, OK. Sorry,'' he noted.
And smiled.
I wanted to shake him like a rag doll. What a missed opportunity.
Dykes can rampage through the News at Ten studios and storm Parliament
and he didn't even have the balls to interrupt a silly little satellite
show? Where are the anti-nuke lot recruited from these days?
Flower-arranging classes?
Mind you, I shouldn't throw stones when I live in such a glass house
of political apathy. My protest days are over.
I SUSPECT that I had simply liked the tunes, and the putative Baroness
was such a formidable foe, allowing me to vent childhood fears,
embodying as she did such classic villainous qualities, a milksnatcher
who was as terrifying as the Child-Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
who made as many poisonous promises as the evil queen in Snow White.
I had more time on my hands then and marches and campaigns were a
perfect outlet for resentments and aggressions stored up through
adolescence. Now I reserve my passion for other pursuits and confine my
political outrage to half-hearted tuts and mutters over the morning
papers.
These days the only time I shake off my Scottish reserve and shyness
and give vent to rising ire is when some dork eats crisps or sweeties in
the theatre. Sad, really.

CORONATION Street actor Simon Gregson -- who plays tearaway Steve
McDonald -- was ordered to attend a court after magistrates found him
guilty yesterday of driving a BMW at 70mph in a 40mph zone.
Magistrates at Stockport, Greater Manchester, issued a bail warrant to
ensure that the actor appears in court on a future date after finding
him guilty in his absence of speeding, driving without insurance, and
not having an MoT test certificate.
Mrs Mary Stewart, chairman of the magistrates, ordered that Gregson,
charged in his real name of Simon Alan Gregory, should attend court
after being told that he already had six points on his licence for
driving without insurance last year, and now faced disqualification
under the totting-up procedure.
Mr Barrie Darby, prosecuting, said Gregson, of Thornton Road, Heald
Green, Stockport, was clocked driving a BMW 525i at 70.6mph in a 40mph
zone in Cheadle, Stockport, at 11.14am on January 16.
Traffic was light at the time and he had overtaken three vehicles.
When cautioned, the actor told police: ''No reply.''
He subsequently failed to produce his insurance, MoT documents, and
driving licence at a police station.
Mr Darby said Gregson had been told of yesterday's hearing.

<TEXT>
A ''SELF-SUFFICIENT'' community in Morayshire was criticised yesterday
for using taxpayers' money to build a sewage works for its
''economically sustainable village''.
A local resident has hit out at the Findhorn Foundation, near Forres,
after it secured an #80,000 grant from the European Union to build a
US-style organic sewage system.
The community itself raised half of the system's #160,000 cost.
However, a former Fleet Air Arm officer, who has retired to Findhorn and
whose house overlooks the foundation's premises, says it should have
paid for the lot.
Sir Michael Joughin, of Ederslie, Findhorn, a former chairman of
Scottish Hydro Electric, said: ''How can they say they are economically
self-sufficient if they are going to Europe with a begging bowl?''
He added: ''The foundation could not run their activities without the
relief from UK taxes given by their charitable status.''
He continued: ''There is also the social security system, which allows
their 'wider community' to return to this area and add to Forres's
mysteriously high unemployment figures. It is a joke to say they have an
economically sustainable village.''
However, Mr Glenn Walters, the foundation's American-born spokesman,
replied: ''We are not a net drain on the community. We spend around
#800,000 per year on essential services and none of our members is
allowed to draw the dole.''
He added: ''The sewage works we have received money for is extremely
innovative and could point the way forward for others.''
Local people fear the community may be interested in extending its
stake in the local housing market, which some say is already as much as
10%.
However, Mr Walters said: ''We have no plans to take over the
village.''

THERE was plenty of security in the parliament building in Tiflis,
capital of Georgia, when I was there last month. The place was the scene
of hectic political activity as parliament voted on a new constitution,
and men with droopy moustaches and machine guns hung around in every
corner, to protect the government against rebels, rivals, and the mafia.
So they used a car bomb. First reports from Tiflis suggest that the
President, Edward Shevardnadze, is lucky to have survived.
Parliament now operates out of the former Communist Party
headquarters. Parliament itself was demolished in a civil war in 1991,
when the first democratically elected President of Georgia, Zviad
Gamsakhourdia, retreated to a bunker under the building and defied his
enemies. They shelled the place with tanks and mortars, destroying it
and several neighbouring buildings.
The war was provoked by Gamsakhourdia's raving xenophobia and
paranoia. He incited the Georgians to purge their country of foreign
elements. Since that meant over one-third of the population, there was
of course an immediate uprising against him.
The Ossetians in north Georgia drove out the Georgians, and then the
Abkhazians on the Black Sea coast started their own ethnic cleansing.
The Georgians, much to their credit, turned against the man who had let
the genie out of the bottle. He eventually escaped from the parliament
building and took to the hills. He was killed a year later.
Yesterday's attack on President Shevardnadze could have been the work
of ''Zviadists'' seeking revenge. There is still the running threat of
civil war from the ultra-nationalists.
Shevardnadze is immensely popular: when he threatened to resign last
year the streets in front of his office were blocked by huge crowds
demanding he reconsider.
All the same, there is still bitter opposition. Shevardnadze cut a
deal with the Russians earlier this year under which Georgia rejoined
the Confederation of Independent States and guaranteed the Russians a
20-year lease on their bases.
Alternatively, the attack could have been the work of a disgruntled
minority. The Abkhazians have driven out 250,000 Georgians. They
naturally fear that the Georgian army will seek to recover its lost
territory. Killing Shevardnadze might postpone that evil event.
But the President himself first accused the mafia, the hoodlums who
nearly wrecked the country in the aftermath of the insurrection that
overthrew Gamsakhourdia, so they are the prime suspects.
Shevardnadze returned to Tiflis from Moscow after Gamsakhourdia was
driven from office. He stepped into the vacuum and was made President.
He was Georgia's most celebrated citizen, the only one known outside the
Caucuses.
He has been Gorbachev's Foreign Minister in Moscow during perestroika.
He resigned at Christmas, 1990, claiming that Gorbachev's enemies were
planning a coup.
The coup duly took place, in August, 1991, leading to the
disintegration of the Soviet Union -- and the independence of Georgia.
For the first year he was home he controlled nothing much beyond his
own office. The mafia, calling themselves the ''Mkhedrioni'', meaning
the Horsemen, modelling themselves on the Cossacks, seized everything
else. Georgia, for several months, hovered on the brink of total
dissolution, before Shevardnadze at last brought some measure of order
to the country -- with Russian help.
He also cut a deal with leaders of the mafia, allowing them to convert
to legitimate business. Some of them, no doubt, felt left out.
I was in Georgia to address a seminar on the press. It is a country
more than half free, but still burdened by the legacy of Bolshevism.
There is not much toleration for opposition, and all too many Georgians
still believe that disputes are best settled with the gun, or the bomb.
Shevardnadze himself has all the democratic credentials. He encouraged
a free press in Moscow, much more convincingly than Gorbachev, and
rallied to the defence of parliament when the tanks were sent against it
four years ago. He was with Yeltsin on that occasion, a choice that
served him well later.
All the same, being nearly blown up can change a man's view of things
considerably. There are elections scheduled for next November. The real
test of Shevardnadze's democratic instincts, and Georgia's, is whether
they go forward, and if the opposition is allowed to contest them,
despite the attack of the Horsemen.

ViennaTHE Iraqi regime plotted to use nuclear fuel from two research
reactors as a short-cut to an atomic bomb and planned to test it by
dropping it on an enemy, a UN nuclear chief said today.
The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said the Iraqis
were only stopped by Allied air raids during the Gulf war.
Professor Maurizio Zifferero said details provided by Saddam Hussein's
Government this month came as a surprise.
''We believed before that the Iraqis were years away from obtaining
sufficient weapons-grade uranium,'' he said.
''What happened in Baghdad was that they admitted to having tried a
short-cut. It was a very well-guarded secret.''
The Iraqis told Prof Zifferero that a crash programme to build a
nuclear device began in September, 1990, a month after Saddam sent his
troops storming into Kuwait. The aim was to extract enriched uranium
from two research reactors, one of French design, the other Soviet.
''The fuel elements contained a sufficient amount of highly enriched
uranium for at least one nuclear device,'' he said.
Baghdad reckoned it could extract at least 22lbs of uranium from each
reactor.
Prof Zifferero also learned that the Iraqis had thought about testing
their planned device either through an underground explosion or by using
it as a weapon against an enemy.
''They were not sure what the final experiment would be, whether in
the form of a test, such as an underground test, or an actual deployment
in the field,'' he said.
''They were considering both.''
Prof Zifferero led an IAEA team in Baghdad from August 17 to 20 to
receive fresh information on Iraq's schemes to develop weapons of mass
destruction.
The crash atom bomb programme would have cut the time needed for
Baghdad to manufacture a device. But Prof Zifferero said it had yet to
overcome huge technical challenges to turn the fuel into an ingredient
suitable for a bomb.
Some progress had been made, however, as the Iraqis had already set up
a centrifuge enrichment programme at their engineering design centre at
Rashdiya, north of Baghdad. Research work on building a nuclear weapon
was also being carried out at Al Atheer and Tuwaitha.
''This all came to a halt in the second half of January, 1991, because
of the damage inflicted at the installations by the coalition bombing
raids,'' Prof Zifferero said.
The ''short-cut'' programme had been ordered by Hussein Kamel Hassam,
a son-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, who defected to Jordan on
August 7. He confirmed the details of the crash programme when Prof
Zifferero spoke to him in the Jordanian capital.--Reuter

I AM sorry that W J O'Hagan did not read my letter properly before
replying to it (August 25). I would reiterate that I have nothing
against single parents who find themselves in that situation through no
fault of their own.
Secondly, in the case that he outlines, does he not think that the
fiance has an obligation to the child? Where is he now? Why must the
taxpayer, who has no choice in the matter, be left to pick up the tab?
Thirdly, I have never asserted that ''only the well-off should have
the right to have children''. If that were the case, I would never have
been born. I believe it is up to individual couples to decide when it is
right for them to have children. Can they afford the time, the energy,
the patience, and yes, the money?

TWO letters from males on the row over single mothers -- no mention of
the responsibility of the fathers (August 23).
Time for parents of sons to tell them not to indulge until they can
afford to support a child and its mother? And that that support has to
go on for at least 16 years.
Why should taxpayers subsidise the pleasures of a few minutes, of a
male, for 16 years? Parents must tell sons to take secure precautions or
not indulge till marriage.

LECTURERS have voted against taking strike action in support of three
colleagues made redundant by a further education college.
The Educational Institute of Scotland, which represents eight out of
10 FE college lecturers, said it was disappointed to have lost the vote
among its members at Jewel and Esk Valley College in Dalkeith.
Only 45% of EIS members took part in the ballot, with 33 voting
against taking action, and 20 in favour of supporting those who have
lost their jobs.
Mr Jack Dale, the union's further and higher education secretary, said
the outcome was especially disappointing for the three unpromoted
lecturers.
Mr Dale said: ''I am sure that the very low poll reflects the extent
to which members in the college feel vulnerable in the face of a
management which, backed by legislation which has stripped employees of
their protection rights, has refused to negotiate with branch leaders.''
The union remained opposed to managements using compulsory
redundancies and would pursue unfair dismissal claims on behalf of the
three, he said.
The EIS had argued that there was no need for the college to make
compulsory redundancies after it had achieved more than 20 job losses by
voluntary means.
The college sought to reduce its staff costs after experiencing a
shortfall of almost #650,000 in its budget.
Some lecturers at other colleges which have had their funding cut have
volunteered to go early, although disputes are also looming where
compulsory redundancies have been sought.
There will be further staff cuts in the sector as colleges, which are
now free-standing institutions run by boards of management, adjust to a
new system of formula funding from the Scottish Office.
No-one was available for comment yesterday at Jewel and Esk College.

SCOTTISH tourism chiefs made an appeal for more funds yesterday to
build on the best early season figures for the last five years.
However, the tourist industry will need to find its own financing for
marketing and the new area tourist boards over the next few years.
Buoyed by the latest figures, the Scottish Tourist Board said
yesterday that a ''considerable'' amount of money would be needed to
continue the momentum.
The figures for UK tourism to Scotland from January to May 1995 show a
16% increase in bed nights, an 18% rise in trips, and a 14% increase in
turnover compared to the same period last year.
STB chief executive Mr Derek Reid said: ''It does seem that our
marketing message is hitting its target but what we must aim for is
long-term growth and not the boom-and-bust cycle which has characterised
our industry's performance in recent years.
''1995 may prove to be the year we set that pattern in motion.''
Representatives of the tourist industry from throughout Scotland met
in Pitlochry yesterday to hear of the work the board carried out last
year and its plans for the future.
But, despite an enthusistic response from delegates, Mr Reid stressed
that millions of pounds were still needed.
An extra #3m alone would be required if television advertising at the
level seen in the Granada area was carried out throughout England.
Mr Reid said: ''Funds by themselves are not the solution. You've got
to have the correct focused marketing. We need to present Scotland on
its strengths.''

Frankfurt
FRAUD investigators arrived in Germany today to see jailed Barings
Bank trader Nick Leeson, the man blamed for the collapse of the
London-based bank.
The Serious Fraud Office said one of its officers and two policemen
probing the bank's collapse last February were in Frankfurt.
They are expected to see 28-year-old Leeson for the first time
tomorrow at the Frankfurt prison where he has been held since his arrest
at the city's airport on March 2.
He will speak to the investigators ''under caution,'' meaning he has
been warned that anything said by him can be used in a British criminal
trial.
Leeson has been waging a high-profile campaign to be sent to Britain
to face justice rather than be extradited to Singapore, where he says he
fears an unfair trial and long prison term.
But the SFO has said it is under no obligation to apply for his
extradition and will only do so if Singapore's request is rejected.
A Frankfurt court is expected to issue a final ruling early next month
on whether to send Leeson to Singapore to face trial on 12 charges of
forgery and cheating.
A German prosecutor handling the case, Hans-Hermann Eckert, has said
he does not expect the Singapore request to be rejected and that Leeson
could be on his way as soon as late October.--Reuter.

AS ONE who was a mere child, the oldest of three, when his parents
divorced, I find the one-dimensional views of Kirsty Scott offensively
ignorant and unhelpful in establishing a rational debate (August ).
We live in a complex society in which most of us have had to lower our
aspirations as the comparatively affluent UK continues to drop down the
world's economic pecking order. Economists of every political viewpoint
agree that the cost of social services is a major public-spending
millstone around the country's neck, though they differ considerably on
the best solutions.
A few percentage points' swing, either way, can make an awful lot of
difference in these circumstances, down to the size of the district
housing queue.
It is a fact that single mothers, among others, are given priority in
matters of housing. I have young family friends who were advised by
social services not to legalise their offspring, despite the threat of
an in-law fatwa, until a council flat was obtained, and I have witnessed
the same advice given to others in social service offices.
In those areas where the housing list is booked solid for the next
decade or so, priority status for anyone obviously becomes meaningless,
a particularly galling situation for married folk condemned to a
lifetime of over-priced rented accommodation when so much of public
housing in their area is taken up by single-parent families.
I know of several mainly working-class communities across the UK,
including at least one in Glasgow, where teenage girls get themselves
pregnant for this very reason, with no intention of marrying or living
with their far-too-immature, loutish boyfriends.
A decade ago, a fast-track social services administrator admitted to
me the system had encouraged her to deliberately get pregnant by a
toyboy, whom she promptly threw out on missing her next period so her
friend could return swiftly to her bed.
All these things happen, they are not just Tory tales, and it doesn't
require many of them to throw a poorly thought-through system badly out
of kilter.
Out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancies do, I believe, arise from a similar
combination of social and physical interactions as with any other sort
of pregnancies. The real question is, what was a supposedly decent girl
of 15 with a broad liberal education doing having sexual intercourse
with a 16-year-old boyfriend, and without either taking the necessary
precautions?
If she did mature into responsible adulthood, probably with loving
family support and her child/children healthy and well-adjusted, she is
in a tiny blessed minority.
What John Redwood proposed was not a catch-all adoption policy for
every teen offspring but for the mechanisms to be in place to realise
the timely adoptions of babies where the too-young, isolated mothers are
unable to cope; they are a far larger group!
I am sure there are those who would wish to turn the clock back 40
years or more and whip unmarried teen mothers into solitary confinement.
A civilised society should make reasonable allowances for human errors
of judgment but not bend over backwards into the sort of schemes which
encourage the behaviour they are supposed to alleviate.
Possible solutions lie as much in indirect approaches as in direct
support. Unmarried and single parents share problems in being inhibited
from acquiring employment which would cause them to lose income with
respect to family support.
Policies which are too directed to the poorest creates the deepest
poverty traps and discourage employment. Thus recent attempts to reduce
those on benefit have actually increased the number of recipients.
Tapering working families gradually from benefit into employment
should accelerate their complete removal from state support.
Encouraging successful firms and some unions to appreciate the follies
of over-slimmed, not always underpaid, workforces is another component
in a complex equation.
Families forced to live on benefit for years do suffer genuine
deprivation. But the extent of some benefits, such as comprehensive
household fittings and fixtures, are more than working families can
afford. There should be greater solidity and quality to public housing
and fewer trappings.
Those who have come up in the world should expect to move into more
comfortable and spacious private homes, releasing basic public housing
for the genuinely poor.
Many would be persuaded more easily if such a transfer kept them in
their own neighbourhood. Except that local authorities of old had the
knack of concreting whole wards with public schemes which they
maintained miserably. Breaking them up conceptually or with dynamite is
very necessary.
True progress is achievable with open debate, not posturing mind-sets
and attitudes.

IN the fans-with-typewriters stakes Ken Smith's coverage (August 29)
of the proposed Partick Thistle take-over wins the brown-nose award. It
is nearly as difficult to count the inaccuracies and the unverified
statements from Jim Oliver as it is to trace the money the chairman
claims to have put into the club.
George Galloway and I have never publicly identified the members of
the consortium. This was on their wishes, presumably because they feared
the kind of odious remarks Mr Oliver has come out with.
Charan Gill has, however, identified himself so it is fair to comment
on his part in this. Your article claims that his involvement was
''based only on a short phone call'' with Mr Galloway. This would be
incredible if it wasn't just plain laughable.
Indeed, a Herald journalist and photographer joined me, Mr Galloway,
Imran Muneer, and Mr Gill for lunch at the Ashoka resturant in Ashton
Lane, Glasgow, photographed the meeting, and reported on it!
Further, Mr Oliver is quoted as asserting that no businessman
contacted him about any offer. Explain then the formal fax and letter
sent to him on Monday morning from a respected business consultant --
more than three hours before our press conference -- which not only
intimated the interest of three businessmen, one of whom was Mr Gill,
but also carried the name of his accountant.
The Herald goes on to say that prior to the press conference Mr Gill
told George Galloway that he was pulling out of the bid. I have checked
this with Mr Galloway -- unlike your reporter -- who says that this is
totally untrue.
Charan Gill did phone him late in the morning and in the brief
conversation said only that he was holding a meeting later in the day
with eight prominent businessmen who were interested in taking over the
club. I understand that this meeting subsequently took place at the
offices of Pannell Kerr Forster.
Mr Oliver's remarks on the premium-rate ''Jagsline'' and subsequently
to BBC Scotland are repugnant to me and to all Thistle fans. Sadly he
still clearly fails to appreciate the import of what he has said. His
record at Firhill, however, speaks for itself.
To take just the issue of the ''new #2.5m stand'' (#2.3m actually!)
which he looks across to from his office. It must, indeed, give him
immense pleasure that, like Yossarian and the officers' club in
Catch-22, he had almost nothing financially to do with it.
As the club's accounts show, #1.7m was contributed from public funds,
another #300,000 from the fans, with the balance presumably met from the
sale of a string of players last year including Gerry Britton, George
Shaw and Craig Nelson.
Under Mr Oliver's stewardship players have consistently been sold to
balance the books and none purchased. This is a matter of record and
blindingly apparent to any fan. And on this issue of supporters, I not
that I have ''now'' become one.
In which case I suppose I'd better throw out all my pathetic
memorabilia -- like the cotton hooped shirt and the shiny one with the
Watson Towers sponsors' logo, both of which substantially pre-date Jim
Oliver's involvement at Firhill -- and start to learn the names of the
present team.
Will Mr Oliver put any money into the side? I think not. Will he be
around to steer the club towards its annual flirt with relegation? I
hope not.

AS an individual, John Macleod has a right to dislike the Roman
Catholic Church if he so wishes.
However, as a professional journalist undertaking an investigative
article, he really should have familiarised himself with the dogmas of
the Roman Catholic faith.
Taking a cheap snipe at the peripheral shows his ignorance of the
essence of this faith.

EDINBURGH is set to have a record year for tourism, it was predicted
by the industry yesterday.
Hotel room occupancy rates for the first six months of the year show a
rise of 5% over the corresponding period last year to an average 69%.
With several major events having taken place in July and this month,
including the Tall Ships Race, the Open Golf Championship, and
apparently record-breaking Edinburgh Festival, figures for the second
half of the year look likely to ensure a record 12 months.
Mr Alan Clarke, Edinburgh Tourist Board's director of marketing, said
that hotel occupancy in May reached a record 83%, up 7% on May last
year.
''Edinburgh appears to be performing better than most, if not all, our
competitor cities in England.
''Most sectors of the industry in the city are reporting growth -- not
just hotels but also guesthouses, visitor attractions, and shops.''
Mr Clarke said that next month figures would also be boosted with the
opening of the new Edinburgh International Conference Centre and later
in the year the Phantom of the Opera season at the Playhouse Theatre.

THERE'S nothing more guaranteed to wake you up over breakfast than
finding yourself described in The Herald as ''unnatural, dangerous, and
evil'' -- an experience which is unlikely ever to befall any of your
heterosexual readers (I hope), but which those of us who are gay were
treated to today, thanks -- yet again -- to John Macleod (August 29).
Where does one begin to counter this tide of abuse from him? If I and
my fellow gays who lead our lives of occasional romance, occasional
eroticism, frequent tedium, and sometimes -- the greatest experience
life has ever given me -- love for another person of our own sex, are to
be described as ''evil'', how in the world can John Macleod describe
ethnic cleansing or nuclear war? The whole currency of ethical debate is
cheapened by such misuse of the word.
John Macleod is correct when he says that many gays live with
self-loathing and that alcohol abuse, neurosis, and attempted suicide
are all more common amongst gays than in the community at large. But who
can be surprised by this when we are subjected to the kind of hostility
John Macleod expresses articulately and many people in much cruder
terms?
Gays are ordinary human beings, no weaker than anyone else, and no
stronger either. When we read that our loves are ''absolutely and in all
circumstances wrong'' some of us begin to believe it; some of us cannot
shake off the feeling that John Macleods of this world might be right,
except when in a haze of drunkenness.
I can tell him what is ''absolutely and in all circumstances wrong''
-- it is to misuse the skill of the writer to contribute to a bigotry
which so oppresses some of its victims they are driven to take their own
lives.

NEVER one to tiptoe away from a topic which he believes should be
aired, John Macleod in his essay, On course for paganism, bemoans ''the
strange death of Reformation Scotland'' and the loss of ''a religious
tradition which once fired our culture''; and he asks ''what reality
remains to religious feeling in central Scotland'' (August 26).
There is no doubt that the ''Scottish Protestant dream'' was real to a
very significant proportion of the population in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries.
Tom Nairn referred to it in a fine essay analysing ''The Three Dreams
of Scottish Nationalism'' over 20 years ago. He concluded that the
egalitarian and humanitarian vision of the Reformers was not achieved
because they did not have the economic power, the capital, to put it
into effect.
I accept his case and thus argue that it is only fruitless nostalgia
to think of what might have been. Humanity has moved on and so has
Scotland.
One of the ways in which we have moved on is the diminution of
''religious feeling'' using Mr Macleod's phrase to mean feeling in the
practice of the Christian religion. Some words of a noted American
lecturer on psychology, Robert A Johnson, are relevant to this:
''Much of our religious heritage is a map or set of instructions for
the deepest meaning of our interior life, not a set of laws for outer
conduct. To relate to our religious teaching only in its literal
dimension is to lose its spiritual meaning.''
In other words, if genuine spiritual experience is not present in a
religious practice, such practice becomes a form of materialism. It is
like an electric bulb which has fused. I suspect that much religious
practice in this country is like that.
We have not lost our inheritance. But we cannot live in it. Of course
it informs our present, and we should be aware of it. The power of the
holy spirit which fired the Reformation is a universal power.
It is still available to those who can attune to it, whether they are
Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, or none of
those, even ''pagans.''

SATURDAY's Herald Essay by John Macleod is so true that I had to write
my thanks.
We live in very dangerous times, but we are still free. We still have
God's Word in the Bible. It is vital that we pray for our Lord to aid us
in the battle and guide us into truth. We Scots used to be called the
people of the Book. Let us return to God's Word, the Bible.
I will also pray for our Queen, Country, and Commonwealth and an end
to European federalism which would be slavery.

THE first -- and by far the best -- film version of The Thirty-Nine
Steps is the Hitchcock version with Robert Donat playing the lead. There
is a particularly nice moment when Richard Hannay, having sought refuge
from his pursuers on a political platform and been mistaken for the main
speaker, excuses his delay in rising after the chairman's effusive
introduction by saying that he completely failed to recognise himself
from the chairman's opening remarks!
I often have that same feeling. Among the many spectacular successes
the blurb handed out to hard-pressed chairpeople claims for me is in
once producing a party political broadcast which attracted more viewers
than Coronation Street.
This is true, if only by virtue of the fact that the offending
broadcast appeared on three channels compared with Coronation Street's
one. The broadcast was one of a series run by the SNP some 10 years ago
on a soap opera format.
If I remember correctly the plot which grabbed the attention of
viewers was called The Nightmare and concerned our hero settling down in
front of the television and dreaming of waking up after the election to
find the newsreader telling him that a re-elected Margaret Thatcher had
taken the axe to Ravenscraig. There then followed an animated political
discussion with the newsreader and a happy ending which unfortunately
was not repeated in real life.
Thanks to the ingenuity of the BBC staff in Glasgow and the
considerable acting talent of many of the then Take The High Road cast
these little political vignettes were rather successful, despite being
produced on a shoestring budget. They were part of an early attempt to
break away from the stilted format of political broadcasts which had
people immediately searching for the remote control.
Other parties have tried the same trick, albeit in different ways, and
the broadcasts are now usually totally different from the
face-to-the-camera presentations of the 50s and 60s. Kinnock the Movie
was generally regarded as something of a mini classic for Labour in 1987
while Sean Connery specials shook and stirred the political scene for
the SNP in 1992.
Recently I saw the Tories try the soap opera format and do it so badly
that I found it not altogether surprising that new research indicated
that Tory broadcasts were having a negative impact, ie, they were
persuading people not to vote Tory.
Since shooting the messenger is a longstanding political tradition it
seems that the Tory response to this disquieting statistic might be
voluntarily to pull the plug on its broadcasts. What would be sinister
would be if this were used as a lever to attempt to turn off the switch
on all the others.
PPBs, as they are known, have few friends outside the political
parties. To the broadcasters they are an annoying headache in their
schedules, particularly in Scotland where opt-out spots are often
difficult to find. An SNP broadcast was once on the receiving end of
outraged complaints from space enthusiasts because BBC2 opted out just
after midnight at the very point the space shuttle was landing!
Despite its unpopularity there is an argument that the humble PPB is
the single most important reason why corruption in UK politics is at a
lower and lesser level than across the good-old USA.
Over here the number of PPBs is set by the number of votes gained at
the last election, and during elections also by the number of
candidates. Despite the odd complaint here and there it is basically a
fair system. No-one is allowed to buy television space beyond the quota.
Over there all elections are basically determined by television
advertising, and this produces two predictable results. First, that the
message is negative because that is the most effective use of 15-second
TV spots. Secondly, that the funds required to finance such campaigns
place candidates and parties hopelessly in hock to vested interests.
The Tories spent around #20m at the last election -- much more than
the other parties combined -- and around 200 times the entire campaign
budget of the SNP. Big although this may seem, it would be a drop in the
ocean compared with what would be necessary to fund an intensive TV
advertising campaign. A dozen or more Asil Nadirs would be required to
finance such an extravaganza.
To keep up, Labour would either be forced into even more reliance on
trade union funding or Tony Blair would need to produce his own set of
millionaire supporters. Neither the Liberals nor the SNP would be able
even to attempt to compete with that level of money swilling about.
Of course PPBs don't necessarily need to stay on the present format of
four minutes forty seconds. They have already been shortened from the
previous 10 minutes, which is an eternity in modern television terms.
Conceivably the time coud be swopped for a number of 30 second slots
which would cause broadcasters and the public less inconvenience. But if
this were to be a foot in the door of paid political advertising then it
should be treated with great suspicion.
The much derided PPB is in fact one of the few remaining bulwarks
protecting genuine democratic competition in the UK. By all means reach
for the remote control, and certainly get upset at poor presentation
from the Tories, or any of the other parties for that matter. However,
like many things, we might not miss the PPB or understand its importance
until it is gone and we open the can of worms that could replace it.

Salem
A NEW vent on Montserrat's rumbling volcano belched steam and ash for
a second day today and authorities left in place a week-old evacuation
order that affects half the island's population.
Volcanic activity was ''at a level high enough for us not to be able
to talk at this moment about anybody being able to return to the hazard
zones'', according to Montserrat's Governor Frank Savage.
The new crack in the volcano in the Soufriere Hills at the south end
of this British colony has issued a constant stream of hot gases and ash
and at least seven small earthquakes were detected under the mountain
late yesterday and early today.
The southern half of Montserrat was evacuated last Wednesday when
scientists warned there was a good chance the volcano, which came to
life on July 18, would erupt.
About 6000 people left their homes -- some for other islands but most
to the north end of Montserrat, where they are staying in public
shelters or with friends and family.
Authorities were keeping a wary eye on sanitation facilities, which
were strained by the number of evacuees using them.
Governor Savage said officials were looking at plans to add toilets to
existing shelters to ease the pressure.
He said there was frustration at the length of the evacuation, which
was in its seventh day. Officials have said they would need to see
several days of decreased volcanic activity before they would consider
lifting the order.
''I think people are putting a brave face on it, but . . . they're
getting frustrated and they really are in pretty uncomfortable
conditions,'' he said.-- Reuter

THE Gulf War brought smart weapons and the wonders of electronic
wizardry into the public domain for the first time. Popular perception
since 1991 has been that all things are possible with new technology.
Reality is another story. The death of a US airman at the start of an
old-fashioned spy mission yesterday underlines the true and continuing
human cost of any military action, even in the hi-tech nineties. It
remains a fact that in the circumstances of a limited conventional
conflict in difficult terrain there is no substitute for the age-old
''eyeball'' form of intelligence gathering with all the risks that the
process entails. Satellites are expensive and difficult to manoeuvre
into the desired orbit. Even high-resolution cameras and infra-red
detectors, the state-of-the-art technology, can be countered or fooled
by a clever opponent. Satellites are also inflexible once committed to a
particular course over the earth's surface.
The U2, on the other hand, is a veteran Cold Warrior. Though little
more than a high-powered glider, it has provided the United States and
Nato with reliable and vital close-up data on potential opponents for
more than four decades. Despite its age it has not yet reached the end
of its shelf life in an increasingly uncertain world. The Americans have
lost two remotely-piloted spy planes over Bosnia in the past two weeks.
Further flights of the top-secret Predators have been suspended to avoid
the possibility of their sensitive surveillance equipment falling into
hostile hands. The unmanned aircraft has the advantage of not putting a
pilot into harm's way. It also deprives an enemy of the chance to parade
a high-propaganda-value hostage for the world's media. Mechanical
failure or unexpectedly skilful Serb air defences appear to have removed
that piece from the board for the meantime.
That was the reason behind the decision to pinpoint Serb targets by
the proven means of the U2 overflight. A pilot can respond instantly to
changing events or priorities, as opposed to a satellite. The downside
is the danger, demonstrated so tragically in yesterday's crash.

ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury George Carey, whose trip to rebel-held areas
of southern Sudan two years ago caused a row between London and
Khartoum, is to visit Sudan in October, state radio said today.
Bishop Gabriel Roric, Minister for Foreign Affairs, announced the
visit after meeting Britain's ambassador to Khartoum, Alan Goulty, the
radio said.
Goulty's predecessor, Peter Streams, was expelled by Sudan after Dr
Carey called off a trip to Khartoum in December 1993 and visited instead
the rebel-held Christian-dominated south of the mainly Muslim country.
Britain reacted by expelling Sudan's envoy in London.
Sudanese President Lieutenant-General Omar Hassan al-Bashir had wanted
Dr Carey to be an official guest of the government but the archbishop,
said it was his practice to travel overseas only as a guest of the local
Anglican Church.
His visit to areas in southern Sudan controlled by the rebel Sudan
Peoples Liberation Army, which includes many Christians in its ranks,
infuriated the government.
The radio announcement made no mention of arrangements for Dr Carey's
visit.
Human rights groups have accused the Sudanese government of
obstructing the activities of the Christian churches and of trying to
convert southerners to Islam by force.--Reuter.

THE time is fast approaching when a decision will have to be made
about the possible referral to the Monopolies Commission of
ScottishPower's bid for the Anglo-Welsh regional electricity supplier,
Manweb. In fact strong rumour suggests Mr Lang will make his mind up
this week. It will be his first major decision since his translation
from the Scottish Office, but few imagine that his mind will be
determined one way or another by his personal identity or earlier
governmental role. He will, however, be under strong pressure from
Professor Littlechild, the electricity industry's regulator, to make a
referral. But then the Professor wanted to refer the Trafalgar House bid
for Northern and was turned down. That might not seem too firm a
precedent, for ScottishPower is a quite different creature from
Trafalgar, and generates as well as distributes electricity. It sells
power directly into England and might have been expected to have used
this capacity to sell through Manweb except that it has anticipated
complaint in this connection and voluntarily surrendered the option of
doing so. A specific case for referral is therefore hard to justify and
the general case seems to have been lost when Northern's fate was left
to the market (though, as it happens, Trafalgar abandoned its bid after
its first stumble).
A referral might not spell failure for ScottishPower, but it would
bring a large measure of uncertainty into the bid's future. In the
interim, while the investigation was taking place (and these do not
proceed with much dispatch), a third party could intervene. The
continental expressions of interest in the English regional electricity
companies are not simply rhetorical flourishes; and ScottishPower fears
that one of these European companies might step in to take advantage of
its groundwork without any impediment, and make a bid.
Such fears may prove groundless, but there is little doubt that a
referral would be a blow to Scottish popular morale which has been
boosted by the notion of a very large UK-wide energy company based in
Glasgow. Having privatised the utilities, it would seem perverse for the
Government to want to insulate them from the operations of the market,
unless some very much larger creations were being proposed. The present
bid should take its course, which might mean a small additional
sweetener. Only the SNP would benefit from a referral, by identifying in
it an expression of anti-Scottish sentiment.

THERE really should be no need nowadays to have to notice that China
is one of the greatest civilisations or that its achievement in feeding
and clothing a fifth of mankind is immense. Spokesmen for the present
Chinese Government feel, however, that they cannot take all that for
granted but have to use it to counter justified criticisms of Government
behaviour. In fact there is no justification for China's human rights
record, which is deplorable. Amnesty International, which has drawn
attention to some recent violations, has no vested interest in seeking
to denigrate China, or in treating it any differently from other
societies which deal with their own citizens in barbaric manner. The
fact that 16 people have been executed in the past fortnight to make
Beijing safer for the UN's Fourth World Conference on Women is a fearful
commentary on the Chinese Government's mind set.
Inevitably Amnesty is being accused of interfering in China's internal
affairs. Every country is sensitive about that sort of development, and
few societies are confident enough to take such criticisms without
displaying resentment. The Chinese Government has taken a major step in
admitting Amnesty -- one of the first benefits of the conference.
Amnesty's willingness to use its critical powers is hardly unexpected.
Millions of Chinese will welcome it, and unless their Government returns
to systematic repression, it is something which will have to be lived
with. The changes which China is undergoing, to make its economy a
global competitor and participant, have sociological and political
consequences. Even if these are delayed it still must seem that they are
unavoidable. For example, China is not a society which has been notably
well disposed towards women (notwithstanding the last, and unusually
powerful, Empress) and that gives the UN conference's location an
unusual irony which will not be lost either among those taking part or
those witnessing and hearing of its deliberations through the local
media. The event is part of a process, now more than a century old, to
modernise China. The modernisers seem at last to have won, but the
Government, which is probably now backing them, is not happy with all
that goes with them.

HAS Richard Demarco set a welcome trend -- or a challenge? His
Festival programme of 80 exhibitions and theatre productions from 20
different countries includes an innovative foray to Dundee, courtesy of
Dundee Rep and Seagate Gallery. It's been followed by the Italians and
Norwegians in Gullane and the Danes in Linlithgow. Where will it stop?
When is a Fringe a fringe?
The middle-age spread of the Festival -- well it is in its 49th year
after all -- is reflected in both the (free) Edinburgh Gallery Guide
Festival issue which stretches to Haddington, Stenton and
North-Northumberland as well (from this week on the Internet at
http://www.hw.ac.uk/eca www/galleryguide/) and the brand new (free)
Contemporary Art Exhibitions listings produced by the enterprising
Collective Gallery.
This covers -- wait for it -- Glasgow. It includes the CCA, Street
Level, Glasgow Print Studio (who also exhibit in Edinburgh), Glasgow
School of Art and Transmission, It even has a map of Glasgow, plus one
with Castlemilk's Fringe Gallery. There's that F word again! This guide
has Glasgow exhibitions in pink, Edinburgh's in black. Any reference to
overdue electricity bills or a fading Red Clydeside is unintentional,
they tell me. It just means Glasgow's ''in the pink!''.
So? Is it possible? Can Edinburgh and Glasgow share a Festival fringe?
Glasgow's 1999 UK City of Architecture and Design bid made much of its
intention to collaborate, and grant-giving bodies view this as essential
now that cash is tight. And although 1999 officials seem to be asleep,
it looks as though the grassroots artistic community -- which has more
nous and generosity of spirit that it's given credit for -- has decided
to get on with it.
In the spirit of future friendly Festival expansionist policy, I've
spent much time plunging from one Fringe to the other, from Dundee and
Kirkcaldy (superb #2m refurbished Pathhead Theatre) to Traquair
(fabulous garden installation using motifs from the family crest), and
beyond. Tim Clifford and Dr Duncan Thomson of the Scottish National
Galleries have also been voting with their feet.
I spotted our Tim, still in a state of Grace, at the Glasgow School of
Art 150th anniversary launch, and Thomson at Keith McIntyre's
Dumfermline exhibition, a mere 15-minute drive from the rather noisy
Royal Scottish Museum Summer Party.
Linlithgow's Fringe Great Danes (applied arts and prints at the Line
Gallery), runs in parallel with the Festival's official Danish show at
the City Art Centre patronised by a delegation of 60 visiting
dignitaries and artists including two ministers of state -- this from a
country exactly the same size as Scotland.
The Linlithgow exhibits are by the same craftsmen as in Edinburgh --
but here things are for sale.
The Grange, also in Linlithgow, further bridges the east-west gap with
work by four Glasgow-based artists. Bellingham, Stewart, Smith, and
Treffry benefit from showing in a beautiful setting belonging to the
family of Cadell, the painter.
Traquair is part of Demarco's new passion: gardens. His summer school
journeyed to the Festival via 30 gardens from Hampton Court to Edzell's
Zodiac Garden. Traquair's installation, Ursa Major, uses natural
grasses, flowers, and cones to create stars, hearts, a key, a dove --
and of course the Bear.
Terry Sandell of Visiting Arts has also been holding his Festival
receptions in a garden. He's used to bridging gaps and making links
across the world. This year he's moved his team to Edinburgh for three
weeks with great success. A bright idea. Why wasn't it done before? Set
up in 1977, Visiting Arts ''promotes and facilitates the flow of foreign
arts into the UK''. Now Sandell has organised the first catalogue of
foreign events (300 so far) which gets wide distribution via embassies
abroad. There's also a conference on Friday at the Fringe Club
(telephone 0131-447 4716).
Demarco features to the fore in all this, with a 29-year record of
Bridging The Gap -- as his 1995 programme is aptly called. This year's
performers include 30 kids from Tuzla Youth Theatre who spent five days
and nights on a bus to get here, and the Polish group, Teatr Podrozy,
whose nightmare journey last year included a fatal car crash. Their
brave return to Edinburgh has been rewarded by Fringe awards galore.
In his speech at Visiting Arts, Demarco underlined his commitment to
extending boundaries, saying that in 1999 he hopes to take the Fringe to
Glasgow as part of the Year of Architecture and Design.
With Brian McMaster loath to have anything to do with the visual arts,
Demarco -- and Clifford -- take on a particular pre-eminence.
Back at the Mound, Clifford's Three Graces are packing them in at a
rate of more than 7000 on a good day; 128,000 visitors and rising.
Postcards, posters, and T-shirts are into their second reprint. And they
used to talk of bums on seats!
No doubt the Scottish Office will be inundated with
performance-related demands for increased cash. And with the National
Galleries still set on a central venue in Glasgow, could it be that
Festival 1999 will see a National Gallery bash in the new Post Office
gallery in George Square? Well, The Herald Festival party did take place
not a million miles from those Three Graces.
Reciprocity. It's a difficult word to say, to spell, to enact. How
many of Glasgow's officials ''made it through'' to the Festival? Very
few it seems. However, they're all off to London on Monday to launch the
1996 Visual Arts Programme there. Glasgow has to wait till Tuesday
night. A fringe too far, perhaps?
Glasgow-Edinburgh collaboration would be helped by a super speed
train, and the M8 definitely needs a facelift. Except for Motorola's
grass pyramids, it's a notoriously monotonous drive. However,
Baillieston's concrete flyover is vastly improved by floodlit special
effects in delicious mauves and turquoise. More please! And how about
something celebratory for 1999? Fibre optics on that gasometer perhaps?
If Prestwick can get #96,000 Lottery money for its public art, surely,
with 1999 on the horizon, the Glasgow-Edinburgh link is in with a
chance.

MONDAY'S sixteenth delve into the Greig-Duncan Collection was a tale
of two presenters. As a Generation Game hostess, Isla St Clair was
always a waste of a good traditional singer, a theory immediately given
full credence when she launched into Band O' Shearers. She has a natural
melodiousness and exuberance that brings songs to life, songs she has
been singing virtually since she learned to talk, be they vigorous romps
or sober ballads. Welcome back.
As a presenter (and not at all unpleasant singer) here, Ian Olson
might be reasonably accused of hiding his light under a bushell. His
theme of whether folk songs speak truth or fiction was amusingly
inconclusive and was posited with the sort of dry wit that would sit
comfortably in a Have I Got News For You chair.
Although I leave her to last, Aileen Carr was by no means making up
the numbers. Her singing is confident and strong and she makes the
longer ballads all the more easily digestible by showing that she really
cares (or occasionally otherwise) about the characters involved.

AFTER the recent feats of Dvorak and Schubert, yesterday morning's
recital of Spanish songs and duets was like a visit to a tapas bar. As
the introductory nibbles of Falla suggested, the emphasis would be on
small, spicy treats, which seemed just right for palates by now in
danger of becoming jaded.
Starting with Falla's Seven Popular Spanish Songs -- music with which
recitalists more often prefer to finish -- was certainly a good idea, at
least in a performance as vivacious as Itxaro Mentxaka's. This Basque
mezzo-soprano brought a bright metallic ring to the music that made it
sound new-minted. The question, however, was whether the rest of the
programme could live up to such a high-definition opening.
Jordi Galofre, relying more on soulful gestures than on beauty of
tone, did not provide the most reassuring of answers, though he sang
Leandro's Romance from Irrasabal's The Port Tavern -- the first of a
series of excerpts of Spanish Operettas -- with the charm to be expected
of a pupil of Carlo Bergonzi.
If the five songs that formed Rodolfo Halffter's The Sailor On Land
proved less persuasive, that was because the words needed a composer
like Berlioz to fill them with the right sort of passionate nostalgia.
But Montsalvage's Five Negro Songs, brilliantly characterised by Itxaro
Mentxaka were another matter, and the duets -- especially the one by
Manuel Fernandez-Caballero that never seemed quite to fit its printed
words -- were a delight.
The same could be said, most of the time, for Bartomeu Jaume's
relentlessly exhuberant accompaniments, which he delivered -- luckily
for the singers -- with the piano lid down.

LAST night the Edinburgh Festival opened the gates of a musical
Jurassic Park and unleashed a dinosaur. The sixties was a period of
great musical ferment -- anything-goes style -- as composers dipped into
the lucky bag of culture and helped themselves to anything they came
across: objets trouves, concrete sounds, electronic sounds, jazz, rock.
It was a sort of pre-digital sampling (perhaps also suggesting vacuity
of original inspiration). Weird and not-so-wonderful results ensued.
Music went out into the street, into the park in one case, into space in
another, and, in some hands, mutated into gigantism.
Generally speaking, the species is extinct. Fossilised examples
survive in recordings. The Requiem for a Young Poet, written by Bernd
Alois Zimmerman at the end of the sixties, and shortly before his own
suicide, recalls many of the features of the period. Suffused with
preoccupations addressing the inner self and the human condition
(freedom, totalitarianism, existentialism, abuse of human rights, etc
etc) the work is enormous.
It involved, on the stage of the Usher Hall, a huge symphony orchestra
(the SWF Symphony Orchestra from Baden Baden, minus violins and violas),
a jazz group, and the Edinburgh Festival Chorus. Up in the grand circle
were massed choirs from Cologne, Stuttgart, and Bratislava. Around the
auditorium were loudspeakers which transmitted the texts, electronic
sounds, and sampled recordings (from Wagner to the Beatles) that
comprised much of the work.
For all the massiveness of scale -- and it is a bleakly depressing,
formidable, and imposing work, assembled, often collage-style, as a
series of monolithic slabs -- the Requiem fails to impress. Ultimately,
it recalls the worst excesses of the period: from its intense
navel-gazing to the sheer indulgence of the assemblage (from the left
speaker the opening bars of the finale to Beethoven's Ninth, from the
right, Paul McCartney singing Hey Jude).
Perhaps because it was so slab-like -- a sonic sculpture -- it was
utterly devoid of lyrical impulse and fundamentally non-dramatic. It was
merely a presentation, like a grotesque musical mobile. You could watch
it revolve; it neither developed nor involved. It was an empty vessel, a
barren hulk, a noisy, lumbering monster of a piece. Maybe a dinosaur,
certainly a turkey.

GERT VOSS'S Shylock is an extroardinary characterisation; a Jew
indistinguishable from his merchant peers on the Rialto, and further, a
steady, subdued man, with Voss playing Shylock's most emotive speeches,
in particular the ''Hath not a Jew . . .'' invocation, with devastating
understatement. He is a resolute businessman, who makes his deadly
demand seem reasonable yet it is a chilly performance, pointedly
eschewing any possibility of pathos.
More extraordinary, and for the wrong reasons, is director Pete
Zadek's version for the Berliner Ensemble. His Rialto is a magnificent
money-making arena, fronted by a Docklands-type facade of steely columns
and mirrored windows and peopled by slick-suit ed businessmen clutching
briefcases and mobiles -- an interpretation which is starting to look
cliched in the extreme, for all its appropriateness to the wheeling and
dealing themes.
Zadek's Belmont is a muddled mess, signalled by descending painted
backdrops which are as sketchy as the goings on at Portia's household
are in this production.
Zadek highlights the comic elements of the play to great effect,
underscoring this focus with the bizarre double casting of Voss and
Ignaz Kirchner (Antonio) as Portia's hapless suitors the Princes of
Morocco and Arragon, but does so at the expense of the play's passion;
Shylock's revenge, Antonio and Bassanio's intense friendship, the
various romances -- all are inspidily portrayed.
There are moments of great hilarity -- the young spikey-haired Uwe
Bohm adlibbing in English makes a feast of the clown Launcelot Gobbo --
which are never counterbalanced by moments of great drama. The court
scene in particular is robbed of its tension by this dispassionate
approach.
It's a piece which seems strangely at war with itself, suffused with
too many internal contrasts -- most pointedly between the performances
of the men and the women. Eva Mattes is a bland, uninspired Portia while
the device of Nerissa (Wiebke Frost) as Absolutely Fabulous's Bubbles is
exceptionally irritating. Striking images and superb delivery from Voss
and Kirchner could not redeem this production's soullessness.

THE Hard Nut -- deliciously outre and glam on the outside, romantic
and caringly true to Hoffmann on the inside!
Most Nutcrackers cheerfully bypass the darker inner kernel of
Hoffmann's tale, preferring instead the happy magic of a child's best
dreams -- a doll that comes to life and takes you to the Kingdom of
Sweets. But Morris, as ever, is in touch with the real dreams that grip
us all our lives. The dreams that deal in loving and being loved. The
dreams that don't always come true.
When The Hard Nut opens, it's on a seriously flaky Christmas party
being given by the Stahlbaums. It's that paradise-time of tackette
fashion, the sixties, and the guests are out to razzle in gruesome
flares, minis, and catsuits. Hovering on the edge of this Charlestoning,
bopping, frugging sea of seasonal green and red are the three Stahlbaum
children. It's their party, not.
Mother (the persuasively padded Peter Wing Healey) gets relentlessly
sauced, the guests letch and paw one another, the kids are palmed off
with Barbie dolls and expensive trash. It's light years away from the
traditional family gathering of Nutcrackers we have known -- and yet
Morris fits it all, brilliantly, into the Tchaikovsky score.
In the midst of all this is Marie (Clarice Marshall) in her
puff-sleeved, sticky-out party frock. The ideal, tender-hearted moppet
for the big adventure lying in wait once the lights go down. Here again,
Morris's invention has at once updated the time-honoured antics, made
them relevant and amusing without losing sight of their original spirit.
Here the rats battle with GI Joes, but best of all, the snowflakes are
unisex! Clad in silver lame skating skirts, cropped tops, and little
pixie helmets, these flakes spin and pirouette on point, tossing up a
snowstorm as they go. It's the essence of Busby Berkeley, it's
exquisitely camp and at the same time it's utterly magical -- everyone,
men and women, careen on point as if they never walked or ran any other
way.
In the second act Morris uses Hoffmann's hard nut as the framework for
a series of brilliant national dances -- he himself is the mysterious
Odalisque in Arabian. The denouement, when Marie declares love for the
rejected, ugly Nutcracker, is the fulfilment of what the entire piece is
about -- a travelling towards maturity, an achieving and giving of love
-- though the little red-eyed mechanical rat that dogs their footsteps
may suggest love's young dream may eventually falter.
The glorious mix of choreographic styles, the absolutely stunning
designs, are what catch one's attention first, but beyond this
marvellous overlay of style lies Morris's rare understanding of the
darker side of fairy tales and his ability to communicate that side to
us in an extravaganza shimmering with cunning wit and exuberant joie de
vivre.

NOTHING quite matches here. Hundreds of confused shoes, piled
higgledy-piggledy in a heap. ''Who I am'' stories that stop short of a
name. Even the language is all out of kilter. Nothing agrees, nothing
really makes sense. Why? Well I suspect love -- or rather love gone
wrong -- if the cause of life's syntax falling into ripe disorder.
Cushioned Soles (devised and performed by NTROP Performance Theatre)
is like a beguiling surreal jigsaw puzzle. Four girls -- in between
sorting out and trying on everything from pointe shoes to Doc Martens --
talk in apparent non sequiturs that then give way to bursts of energetic
dance. But gradually, as the shoes pair up, a bizarre romance of
meetings and partings unfolds from the muddle of text . . . Engagingly
quirky, with lots of clever touches and nicely judged, almost dead-pan,
performances adding to the fun.

THE very youthfulness of Ablaze Theatre Company creates a closeness to
their material that is both the strength and weakness of their
performance.
Using movement, home cine footage and a pre-recorded sound track of
music and childhood reminiscences, they effectively capture the presumed
innocence of the young and frequently painful transition to
''experienced'' adolescence; moving from earliest memories, through
schoolyard fights and friendships, to the excruciating awkwardness of a
teenage disco and the first fumbling sexual experiences.
A more detached, considered, and indeed older, perspective might have
produced work of greater depth, but the company's obvious identification
with their subject matter gave a refreshing take on a much-explored
area.

A TRAFFIC policeman died in hospital early yesterday from injuries he
received on Monday night when the patrol car he was travelling in
crashed.
Constable Mark Davey, 28, was the front-seat passenger in the car when
it careered off the A96 Elgin-Forres road, near the Oakwood Motel, and
crashed into trees.
Mr Davey was cut from the wreckage and taken to Dr Gray's Hospital in
Elgin for treatment to serious head injuries, but died after he was
transferred to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
Mr Davey, of Ashgrove Square, Elgin, was separated from his wife Anne,
who lives in Inverness with their children, Hayley, two, and Lauren, 18
months. He was a well-known fundraiser for leukemia charities and had
raised #30,000 since his 20-month-old daughter Lindsay died from the
disease five years ago.
The Vauxhall Senator patrol car was being driven by Constable Graham
Sloan, 28, who isbased in Elgin. Mr Sloan suffered head and back
injuries in the crash and is still receiving treatment in hospital.
Chief Constable Ian Oliver said the whole force was distressed to
learn of Mr Davey's death.
He said: ''I know that everyone will be deeply shocked at his death
and, on behalf of Grampian Police, I extend our sympathies to his family
and colleagues.
''In his 10 years' service in the Elgin and Banff areas, he had
established himself as an enthusiastic and popular officer.''
Meanwhile, a patient in Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, was told
yesterday that her son -- an RAF man based at Saxa Vord, Shetland -- had
been killed when his motor cycle left the road as he headed for the
ferry on the first stage of his journey south to visit her.
Heart patient Mrs Margaret McSweeney, 62, of Logan Drive in Dingwall
had last seen her son Mr Morgan McSweeney, 23, a senior aircraftsman, in
July. He will be buried at Fodderty Cemetery at the end of the week.

THERE'S a strong feel of behind-the-scenes in this piece. It's as if
Company Pyke (all members of CandoCo) were lifting the lid a little on
their lives as performers.
A giggle of girlies coo over David Toole. Is their fuss to do with his
dancing -- or the fact that, born without legs, he dances on his arms?
Come to that, just what is it we applaud?
And just what is it we expect? By all accounts, not sex. PSST! thrusts
aside common hypocrisies about integrated dance with a tender, sensual
duet between Toole and Charlotte Derbyshire where the shifts between
friendship and physical attraction are traced eloquently, openly.
It's an utterly stunning piece of choreography, part of a witty,
perceptive programme of fine dance -- how good to see Kuldip Singh-Barmi
given more to do -- that challenges perceptions by stretching them in
different, stimulating directions.

COULD be I'm just cynical and suspicious, or could be that launching
straight into a piece of enforced audience participation (in an audience
of around half a dozen) was just too unsettling for an emotionally
repressed Scot like myself, but I never quite shook off a creeping sense
of unease throughout Scott Carter's confessional, comediac, and very
American one-man show.
His studiedly circuitous monologue shifted disconcertingly from the
quirky humour; rye chuckles rather than belly laughs; or his experiences
as a soft porn writer into the heavier territory of near-death
encounters with chronic asthma. Acutely observed, delivered with
measured skill, and cleverly crafted as it was, Carter's story struck
chords, but ultimately failed to move.

MY fingers are crossed. Next Tuesday Peter Chang will learn if he has
beaten a shortlist of five to win Britain's new #15,000 applied arts
award: the Jerwood Prize for Jewellery. It's a first-time prize, by far
the most valuable award for applied arts in the UK. Chang is the only
Scottish-based artist to be selected.
In the way of things, he is not really a jeweller. He doesn't make
silver rings or set diamonds in gold. He's a printmaker turned sculptor
who ended up making the most gorgeous, outrageous, exotic, eccentric,
colourful but indefinable objects which can exist in their own right as
objet d'art -- but which any stylish woman would clamour to wear. His
creations have wit and humour (''I like to incorporate a bit of fun,
spice it up. People take things too seriously'') and only flashing neon
could create more jangling, high-volume colour.
This Jerwood nomination puts him in the limelight. Deservedly so, for
he is one of the most innovative artists I know. His unique vision and
quirky but luscious sense of design goes hand in hand with superb
craftsmanship. To coin a phrase, he's the Faberge of the twenty-first
century.
So what does this master of ornamentation and adornment use for raw
materials? Gold, silver, lapis lazuli? Not at all. He recycles broken
bits of plastic toothbrush, razor handles, toys, old school rulers,
felt-tip pens, knitting needles.
''I wanted something that would reflect the age we live in, and I like
the idea of working with a substance that is usually thrown away. Using
plastic gets away from the preciousness of jewels and gold. Whereas wood
or metal imposes its own character, plastic is anonymous. It only has
the character you give it.''
The first bracelets, brooches and earrings, in 1984, were made for his
wife, Barbara Santos-Shaw, ex-head of printed textiles at Glasgow School
of Art, now teaching at London's Royal College and in Amsterdam. As she
jets around the world from their Pollokshields base she jangles her huge
bracelet cuffs and magnificent earrings in saturated yellow and red,
sometimes offset by pink, mauve and glitter gold. As a redhead, primary
colours suit her. I would love a bracelet but at #1000 have so far
settled for two brooches in red, blue, and bronze with yellow
highlights. They never fail to cause an impact.
In 1987 fashion-design guru Rifat Ozbek featured Chang's jewellery on
the world's catwalks and it hit the cover of Harpers, Elle, and Vogue.
''Rifat came to me because he thought my things went well with his
clothes.''
Soon he was showing his organic, psychedelic designs (some resembling
a cross between a flower and an insect complete with tail and horns), at
the V &amp; A, in New York, Paris's Musee des Arts Decoratif, Helsinki,
Munich, Philadelphia, Amsterdam, Zurich, Budapest, Chicago, Barcelona,
Brussels -- even in his birthplace, Liverpool.
Sounds perfect? But the truth is that although Chang has made a
top-rank international reputation, it's almost impossible to make a
living from these wonderful creations. Some take 400 hours or more to
make. And the dust and fumes from the resins are beginning to wreck his
health. The #15,000 Jerwood could literally be a lifesaver.
Chang may use twentieth-century materials, but their painstaking
application is as old as time. He starts with a carved core of
polystyrene foam which is encased with umpteen layers of brilliantly
coloured polyester resin (some sparkle!), and inset with slices of found
plastic. This is then sanded and polished back to reveal complex
patterns.
It's a version of kasane nuri togidashi, a Japanese technique used
with lacquer work. There are also hints of Byzantine mosaics intertwined
with Antonio Gaudi-esque bulbous decoration -- a far cry from the 1960s
kitsch, pop art, and pop world influences which Chang absorbed in
Liverpool where he knew the Beatles, and Barbara once slept in Yoko
Ono's satin-lined coffin!
His latest departure is into larger pieces with an edge of glamorous
decadence or the allure of the fetishistic talisman: fabulous mirrors,
dancing salt and pepper grinders, their antennae giving them an air of
alien space creatures (which, however, found a fat-cat home in Holland),
an incredible box rather like an exotic fairy-tale beetle, a table (for
a New York loft) breathtaking in its form, its legs from Dr Who, its
surface, which took months, reminiscent of a psychedelic juke box. It
was shown in London's Crafts Council gallery earlier this year to great
acclaim.
Chang's jewellery is radical; magic, unique, stylish. He has obviously
absorbed influences as diverse as Klimt, Miro, and Art Deco, and his
Chinese background gives him an innate love of decoration. But dissect
his work as you will, you can only marvel at the intelligence of his
absurdities, the surprise of his lateral thinking, the raw energy of his
creations. I just hope he wins.

GAVIN STAMP continues his crusade to re-establish the Victorian
architect Alexander Greek Thomson by taking this exhibition of splendid
original drawings and photographs to the Festival.
It makes a handsome display (except for the labels' curling edges),
and presents a lot of information in a palatable way. I was glad to see
they had avoided architectural elevations -- which the public find
difficult to read -- in preference to elegant white models of the
Egyptian Halls, Grecian Chambers, Queen's Park Terrace, and more.
Many people will find the old Annan photos fascinating while new
glossy colour shots show the restoration of buildings like Holmwood and
Great Western Terrace.
The accompanying leaflet provides a succinct introduction. Sadly,
despite sterling work by many activists, including New Glasgow Society
members without whose lobbying more Thompson buildings would be lost,
many of his works have been demolished. No more, says Stamp.

ONCE upon a time . . . we were all children. Wandering -- just like
Alice -- through unknown places full of bewildering people, with
contrary rules that didn't make sense, and always a feeling of being
powerless.
It's this state of confusion that powers the words and movements of
Losing Wonderland. Devised and performed by Ablaze Theatre Company (from
Bristol University), the piece points up the darker sides of childhood
and adolescence.
While personal anecdotes (often brutally funny) form a clever
soundscore, the company dance out scenarios of bullying, shyness,
one-upmanship and quiet fear. The moment when one boy, having pored over
a huge newspaper, folds it into a giant hat and hides inside, is
astutely telling. The world is full of hidden terrors when you are too
young to control your own life. In all, a much-visited subject, but done
here with fresh energy.

SHE ain't no lady. Nor is she a sister. Rather, Donna prefers to stay
true to her calling as British stand-up's top bovver-bird and most
dapper dyke, deftly employing her rapier wit on wispy New Men; leering
old men; stupid young women; compliant Tory wives; overly-supportive
feminists in shapeless, organically-grown clothing; bad-tempered
adolescent girls.
Why is it women, not men, who tend to suffer more under the McPhailite
iron heel? Some wispy New Man sociologist might say it was because Donna
is hardest on herself -- just before Donna kicked him in the crutch.
I'll merely say that Donna's first night picked up when she forswore the
tried-and-trusted aggro approach for newer, gentler, more
autobiographical stuff. Let her hit you with it soon.

YOUNG Tonks is a palpable hit, a laddish graduate of the Lee Evans
school of high-speed twitchiness as well as being a keen-eyed
observational confessor a la Sean Hughes. He derives much mirth from the
senseless cruelty of his schooldays in north Yorkshire; from his recent
experience of undergraduate squalor, privation, and officiousness, and
from his first-hand experiences of the joys and sillinesses of the rave
era.
While Paul's depiction of amphetamine-induced girning and adolescent
mating rituals are spot-on, there's probably less accuracy in his
hilarious presentation of his girlfriend and grandparents as cousins of
Orville the duck. But what the heck: if you can't make friends with Paul
Tonkinson, you are beyond help.

RICHIE HAVENS is famous for two things. First, for that dauntingly
solo opening slot at the Woodstock Festival and, secondly, for his
unique guitar chording technique which relies on the use of a single but
highly versatile thumb.
Running down the steps on to the Jazz Cafe's minimalist stage, Havens
cuts an enigmatic figure dressed, as always, in silk robes, his neck
supporting a mane of beads, he looks part sixties guru and, with bald
pate and greying beard, part benign uncle.
Years of performing have honed his song introductions into the laconic
monologues of the seasoned raconteur which is useful as he also takes an
eternity to tune up his guitar between numbers -- a lifetime's jet
travel having done something irreversible to his hearing, he alleges.
None of this interferes with the litany of interpretive cover versions
which constitute tonight's repertoire.
Drawing heavily on the Bob Dylan canon, this is a greatest-hits
package, though, as Havens would willingly attest, he's never had one
himself. (A version of George Harrison's Here Comes the Sun being the
nearest thing.) All Along the Watchtower highlights fluid
second-guitarist Paul Williams and sees Havens, eyes closed, giving it
some with the thumb and extemporising powerfully with that hot, buttery
voice.
Later we get a free-form Just Like a Woman and a waltz-time
re-arrangement of The Times They Are A'changin' which actually manages
to wrestle some emotional chutzpah from this stalest of protest anthems.
Van Morrison's Tupelo Honey and the aforementioned Here Comes the Sun
are given light, almost nursery rhyme, treatments and we are then given
folksy reworkings of songs by Fleetwood Mac and Sting and there's even a
version of Happy Birthday to You.
In contrast, the echo-protest What You Gonna Do About Me is dark and
sombre and distinguished by some dynamic strumming from Havens. The
crowd of unreconstructed hippies, fortysomething couples and curious
Camden trendies lap it all up -- Havens having got them well and truly
under his thumb.

Theatre
ATHOL FUGARD'S play deals with the ''two profound philosophical
realities . . . pig shit and time''. Pavel Navrotsky deserted from the
Russian army and fled home to hide in his pigsty, for 44 years.
The writing is a small masterpiece of concision and psychological
depth. Pavel's desertion haunts him because of the cowardice it
represents, but cowardice also prevents him seeking freedom and
responsibility.
It is only at the moment when he recognises his similarity to the
animals he loathes and beats that he finds the strength to defeat
childhood memories and a life of fear.
Pinstripe Theatre would have needed more space than they have to give
this its temporal scope and dramatic intensity. However the two actors
do enough to carry off the basic idea.

Paris
RESUMED nuclear testing in the South Pacific was ''very close'',
France said today, as politicians from New Zealand and the Cook Islands
handed an angry note to the French navy from a protest boat off the test
site.
As tension mounted at Mururoa Atoll, the French chased off a
Greenpeace helicopter and the environmental group finalised plans for a
flotilla protest.
Greenpeace has vowed to breach the 12-mile military exclusion zone in
its bid to prevent the resumption of testing.
''There is no doubt that we are very close now to the beginning of the
campaign,'' the commander of French test sites in the South Pacific,
General Paul Vericel, said from the atoll, about 750-miles south of
Tahiti.
''We are now doing preparations to make our experiments from September
1'', Vericel said in a telephone call.
French atomic energy officials said one of the nuclear explosions
would be weapon strength -- almost 150 kilotons.
Vericel was speaking as New Zealand and the Cook Islands
representatives delivered a protest note off the atoll saying the
planned tests were ''monstrous''.
President Jacques Chirac announced in June that France would resume
testing with a final salvo of seven or eight nuclear blasts at Mururoa
or Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia between September and May.--

A RUBBER-FACED prole, Andy Parsons admits to looking like Mel Smith,
Keith Chegwin and/or a potato. His unfeasibly-lofty partner, Henry
Naylor, is plainly a more mellow Cleesian fellow. The ever-altering
balance of power in their relationship is what end ears you to their
cleverly silly sketches and their amiable muggery.
Alongside some technically accomplished aural comedy, they chuck in
base slapstick employing smeary, splattery comestibles. Whether or not

WATERLESS swimming -- very frisky, very flirty -- and a piece (by
Tamsyn Salter) which could well be subtitled Barbie's Revenge. The first
half, featuring works by company members and others, might leave fans
feeling that The re-Animators have deserted the familiar territory of
Gothick camp and studied decadence.
But Piers is here, in Cafe Flesh, with a sharp reworking of ideas
floated in an earlier piece, once Therapy now titled Downward Spiral.
It's a sideways spin on Orpheus and Eurydice, really. This time they
stay together, but in Hell. Visually striking with some cunningly
furious choreography that ultimately suggests Hell is endless,
relentless techno . . .
The dance ranges freely from slinking tango to pointe-work, sometimes
elegantly sinister, sometimes sweaty with all-out manic crash as flesh
meets flesh in torment.

HOW do you tell a horror story when the firesides have mostly turned
electric? This intelligent two-hander by Tim Arthur explores the
comparative chill factors of the horrors of modern reality and the
traditional ghost story.
Patrick Drury is a masterful Alex Crowther, a horror writer on his way
out of print, while Paul Panting gives an excellent performance as Jack
Langton, the younger would-be, clogged by twisted imaginings of his own
life's possible realities.
Despite a Sweeney Todd style ending, this production does contain some
crafted story-telling producing genuine spine thrill. The sun is cooler
and the shadows darker on the way out.

A NEW drama from the prodigious playwright John Cargill Thompson, this
quirky two-hander is predicated on the premise of a homosexual version
of date rape, raising intriguing questions of politcal correctness and
male sexuality, which the text, commendably, not only opens up but also
probes quite vigorously.
Poor stagecraft, the actors stranded on a bare, too brightly lit
stage, made the production seem threadbare but the script is a sturdy
one, if overburdened with black humour, with a tendency to chase jokes
at inappropriate moments.
The performances trod a thin line between impassioned and overwrought,
occasionally slipping between the cracks and losing credibility but Dan
Swinton was convincingly distressed as Karl, the heterosexual man who
had invited his homosexual friend's advances, while Richard Forrest
radiated enough underlying menace as the thoughtful Norman to hit the
right note of ambiguity.

AS I'm about to go in I meet a young Sarajevan woman who's just heard
the casualty figures from the latest bombing of her home town. Then in
the theatre I find three Yugoslav actresses holding a requiem for all
that has been lost, not just in Sarajevo, but in Belgrade, Moscow,
Alexandria and backwards through time.
The contradictions are compelling. These women of DAH Theatre are at
once victim and life-force. They are raped and abused, their memories
lost in scattered photographs, yet lament turns into celebration, fear
into defiant violence, passive into active.
In one enigmatically beautiful image, they pour out bags of salt to
form a massive hieroglyph round a miniature town square, itself
harbouring their treasured photographs. It's an image of desolation,
isolation, yet somehow of hope, and out of the anguish emerges a
forceful plea for life.

<HEADLINE>Ombudsman criticises delay in handling legal complaint and recommends compensation. Law Society inquiry 'unsatisfactory'</HEADLINE>

THE Law Society of Scotland has been heavily criticised for botching
an investigation and told to pay the aggrieved client compensation.
The Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman, Mr Garry Watson, in his
judgment, said: ''In my opinion, this investigation has been thoroughly
unsatisfactory.'' His judgment makes a series of recommendations for
tightening up the society's complaints procedure.
Former Scots Guardsman Adrian Russo wrote to the society in February
1992, detailing several complaints dating back to 1989 against
Hamilton-based firm Hay, Cassels, and Frame. 0 Mr Russo, 31, of
Stonefield Road, Blantyre, Lanarkshire, alleged delays and overcharging
in respect of a #150 retainer and a #4000 bill for his father in dealing
with an estate when he was eligible for legal aid.
The Law Society reporter appointed to look into the complaints issued
a report in November 25, 1992, three months after receiving the files.
He found that the firm had acted reasonably, except in failing to hand
on papers to another firm of lawyers for two months.
The society's complaints committee issued its findings in January 1993
but these related only to Mr Russo's principal complaint and not the
others.
After a further two years and much correspondence, these other matters
were still not resolved, although part of the delay was due to Mr Russo.
There was confusion between the society's reporter and deputy secretary
over what needed to be investigated and which were the relevant files.
''The Law Society investigation of this somewhat complicated complaint
has been the subject of severe administrative error and of delay,'' Mr
Watson said.
''The complainer has handled correspondence relating to this
investigation with patience and decorum, naturally expecting that the
matter would be investigated on a controlled and professional basis,''
Mr Watson said.
''Regrettably, this has been far from the case and it is wholly
understandable that in his last letter to the Law Society, dated
December 13, 1994, his patience finally snapped when the mishandling of
this investigation had become apparent to him.
''While there were a number of separate complaints, each of a
relatively straightforward nature, there is no reason whatsoever why the
investigation should have become so prolonged and confused and why the
complainer should have been caused so much unnecessary inconvenience and
hassle due to such handling by the Law Society.''
Mr Watson said that although he was satisfied that Mr Russo's
principal complaint and that of his mother were ultimately handled
properly, this was not the case with his father's complaint and one
relating to an interdict.
He made six recommendations urging the society to look again at these
matters and consider making an ex-gratia payment to Mr Russo for
mishandling his complaints.
''The Law Society should give serious consideration to means of
avoiding the errors and delays which have arisen in this investigation,
which is no credit to its investigatory procedure,'' Mr Watson added.
Last night, Mr Russo said he was delighted with the ombudsman's
findings.
''I am also pleased about the offer of a payment. I think a
four-figure sum might be a reasonable amount,'' he said.
Mr Kenneth Pritchard, secretary of the Law Society of Scotland, said
it had introduced new procedures and hired more secretarial staff since
the episode, but would not comment on the issue of compensation.
''This is an exceptional case in which the criticism is severe,'' he
said.
''We are very concerned about it and we are dealing with it as a
matter of urgency. We believe the steps we have already taken will
obviate the administrative difficulties referred to and certainly any
question of delay.''

Washington
A PROMINENT Republican senator, facing public hearings over charges of
sexual misconduct, said today he had been so drunk some evenings that he
could not remember some of the incidents.
''In some cases I was very frankly so drunk that I cannot remember the
evening,'' Bob Packwood, who said he stopped drinking three years ago,
told CBS TV.
''That doesn't excuse the conduct but I simply can't remember.''
The Oregon Republican, who became chairman of the powerful Senate
finance committee in November, is accused of making unwanted sexual
advances to 19 women.
The allegations include complaints that Packwood grabbed and kissed
them, often sticking his tongue in their mouths, and in one case
proposed sex.
Asked whether he denied the charges, which span three decades,
Packwood said: ''Some I do. Some I don't. Some I very honestly can't
remember.''
He said he was unable to recall other incidents, such as putting his
arms around a woman at a party 25 years ago, not because of alcohol but
because they had happened so long ago.
The Senate ethics committee has also charged that Packwood asked
lobbyists and businessmen to hire his ex-wife so he would have lower
alimony payments, and that he altered his personal diaries later
subpoenaed by Senate investigators.
Possible action against him includes censure, removal as chairman of
the finance committee or expulsion from the Senate.--Reuter.

Hong Kong
THERE will be none of the traditional popping of Champagne corks on
the first-class deck of a luxury passenger liner when Hong Kong's last
British financial secretary bows out next week.
Sir Hamish Macleod, speaking at a farewell news conference yesterday,
said he would leave on September 4 by air rather than sea, the option
chosen by most senior colonial servants.
He promised to return for the hand-over of Hong Kong to China at
midnight on June 30, 1997. ''We've booked a hotel room,'' he said.
At 55, Sir Hamish is taking early retirement to make way for a Hong
Kong Chinese successor, Donald Tsang, a friend and colleague who has
been groomed for the post.
''I think it will be a little more difficult,'' Sir Hamish, who joined
the Hong Kong government in 1966, said of Tsang's job.
Tsang has the 1997 transfer itself to weather. Beijing has yet to
announce whether it will reappoint the handful of civil servants put in
by the British to the top posts.
On the domestic front, Tsang, 50, will have to contend with an
increasingly politicised Legislative Council, a result of the new
pro-democracy reforms introduced by Governor Chris Patten.
The first all-elected council in Hong Kong's 150 year history will be
voted into office on September 17.
Sir Hamish, meanwhile, shrugs off the difficulties he faced in his
years at the financial helm of the world's eighth largest trading
territory.
Since he took over in 1990, Hong Kong's gross domestic product has
risen 25%, sending it up the per capita GDP ladder to rank 15th in the
world from 23rd five years ago.
''He's a canny Scot. Modest. His nickname is Sir Prudent. Ostentation
is not his style,'' said one colleague, who also described him as
''well-liked and respected by his staff even if he is better at tennis
than karaoke''.
In his role as financial secretary, the number three job in the Hong
Kong government, Macleod had to cope daily with China's fury and
suspicion of British rule in the countdown years.
Patten's arrival and his democratic reforms gave Beijing a political
stick with which to beat the British administration.
But the first, and most enduring symbol of Sino-British discord, was
an ambitious and expensive new airport and port project which Sir Hamish
has been in charge of since its inception in 1989.
China, apparently convinced Hong Kong planned to squander its vast
wealth on the #13bn project, attacked the plan almost from the start.
Early this year, after six years of wrangling and exhausting
negotiations, China finally gave its blessing. By that time, and despite
all the difficulties, the airport was more than 60% completed.
Sir Hamish plans to retire to Edinburgh, play tennis and keep himself
busy with a few non-executive directorships. He was careful to stress
they would be non-Hong Kong companies.
His name is one of 32 put forward for one of the seven World Trade
Organisation appellate posts responsible for arbitrating trade disputes.
''It would be very interesting,'' was all he would say.--Reuter.

Beijing
BEIJING today clamped limits on free speech at an international
grassroots women's forum, prompting a brisk challenge from the top
official of the United Nations-sponsored meeting.
Expanding on earlier edicts barring unauthorised protests in Beijing,
a senior security official said demonstrations against China and its
leaders were also banned inside the venue of the Non-Governmental
Organisations (NGO) forum in rural Huairou.
Public Security Vice Minister Tian Qiyu, security boss for the UN
World Conference on Women and its affiliated NGO forum, said protests
were allowed only in a middle school sports field in the NGO site, which
is sealed off from the Chinese public.
Speech is not free even there, he said.
''Inside the site, NGOs are permitted to have demonstrations and
processions but these should not infringe on the sovereignty of the host
country and should not slander or attack leaders of the host country,''
Tian said at a Beijing news conference.
Tian declined to explain who would determine which speeches
constituted slander or violations of sovereignty.
Forum convener Supatra Masdit, top organiser of the meeting that hopes
to influence the UN conference, issued a statement challenging Beijing's
bid to muzzle anti-Chinese opinions.
''The laws of the host country prevail only outside the site of the
forum,'' she said.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian also contradicted Tian's decree,
saying UN rules -- not China's -- applied in areas designated by mutual
consent as ''UN premises''.
NGO forum organisers said privately they understood UN premises to
mean anywhere inside the forum site and that China had no right even to
designate a special protest area, much less to restrict what could be
said or done there.
''This is very worrying to us,'' one forum organiser said.
The new edict underlined China's sensitivity to dissent at the NGO
forum, shunted to rural Huairou from Beijing in April after senior
leaders grew alarmed that Chinese might see foreign women denouncing
Chinese policy in central Tiananmen Square.
President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin told Iceland President
Vigdis Finnbogadottir that China attached great importance to the
conferences, which she will attend.
''We wish to co-operate with all parties concerned and try our best to
hold this meeting well to make a contribution to improving the global
status of women,'' Jiang said and repeated Chairman Mao Tsetung's remark
that women ''hold up half the sky''.
As Tian spoke, leaders of London-based human rights group Amnesty
International attacked Beijing's ''grave'' human rights record, saying
it was unbelievable that China could execute 16 people to improve
security in Beijing before the conference. Government spokesman Chen
bridled, saying Amnesty's charges about indiscriminate executions were
groundless.--Reuter

EDINBURGH plans to create a ''car-free'' housing development, thought
to be the first of its kind in Britain -- to qualify for a house you
must undertake not to own a car.
The scheme, backed by Lothian Regional Council, would be modelled on
one in Bremen, Germany, which councillors visited on a fact-finding
mission.
A site for the mix of public and private housing has been earmarked
near Gorgie Road, two miles from the city centre. Talks are under way
with potential private developers.
Tomorrow, the council's transportation committee will discuss securing
the site.
Councillor David Begg, chairman of the region's transportation
committee said: ''We are optimistic that if we can gain consensus on the
use of this site for car-free housing we will see this project taking
off.
''Since we first indicated an interest in such schemes, we have had a
very positive response from a variety of developers.
''The area itself is ideal and I am sure that everyone in the area
will be delighted to see this valuable site being used in such a way.''
He added: ''We have an opportunity here to really lead the way with an
exciting idea which is completely viable as a private and public sector
partnership.''

PAISLEY North MP Mrs Irene Adams yesterday said she was recovering
after a stroke and vowed to continue her determined campaign against
drug gangs in the town.
Mrs Adams, 47, was forced to cut short a holiday in America earlier
this month after suffering the minor stroke in New York. She blamed the
pressures of work as an MP, including the fight to clean up her
constituency.
Nevertheless, she said yesterday: ''I feel better than I have after a
bout of flu but I'm taking things easy on the doctor's orders.''
Mrs Adams explained how she lost the feeling in her left hand and foot
one evening in the US city. She had been on a shopping trip in
temperatures of almost 100[DEG]F. Later that evening, she could hardly
walk and then found that she had lost feeling in her hand. A hospital
check-up showed she had suffered a minor stroke but was expected to make
a full recovery. She was told the heat, cigarette smoking, and stress
could all have contributed.
Mrs Adams, who has now given up smoking, has regained some feeling in
her limbs. She has promised to rest but carry on her high-profile
anti-drug campaign, despite threats against herself and her family.
Mrs Adams also blamed the pressures of work on MPs, particularly those
commuting between Scotland and London.
She said: ''The system in this country is crazy, with MPs working long
hours into the night. Scottish MPs suffer the most because they have to
travel the furthest. The daft hours they put in makes them prime
candidates for this sort of thing. I regularly work 14-hour days.''
Mrs Adams's stroke came five years to the day after her husband,
Allen, died of a heart attack.
Meanwhile, neighbouring MP Mr Tommy Graham has dismissed reports of
alleged membership irregularities as ''complete and utter rubbish''.
Newspaper reports claimed the allegations were made in a Labour Party
report into Mr Graham's Renfrew West and Inverclyde seat as well as the
two Paisley constituencies.
He was backed by Labour's Scottish assistant general secretary, Mr
Tommy Sheppard. The report is now being considered by the party's
national constitutional committee.

<TEXT>
A SHERIFF paid a private visit to a remote farm yesterday to see the
Lanark blue cheese plant which is at the centre of a court case.
Sheriff John Allan had already heard 11 days of evidence about
allegations that #27,000 worth of the cheese was riddled with the deadly
food virus listeria monocytogenes.
He wanted to learn for himself the methods and standards of hygiene at
the factory, run by cheesemaker Humphrey Errington.
Sheriff Allan barred the press from the visit.
He made it clear to both sides in the case that he was not convening a
court at the farm.
He drove to Walston Braehead Farm, near Dunsyre, Lanarkshire, early
yesterday on his way to Lanark Sheriff Court. At the farm, he had to
wear protective clothing.
Mr Errington's chief cheesemaker, Mr James Little, 45, showed the
sheriff how the blue vein cheese -- a favourite with the Prince of Wales
-- was made from unpasteurised ewe's milk.
Mr Errington is fighting a bid by Clydesdale District Council to
destroy the suspect batch of cheese stored in deep freeze.
When the case resumed yesterday, Professor Verner Wheelock, a top
chemist who advises major companies such as McDonald's and Sainsbury's
on implementing Government regulations and guidelines on food hygiene,
gave evidence.
He was critical of the council's attitude that all forms of listeria
posed a health risk and should be barred from sale.
The court has heard that there was no recorded case that the
particular strain of listeria found in the cheese had caused illness in
people.
The case is expected to conclude today but QCs for the council and Mr
Errington will make legal submissions to the sheriff at a later date.

EXPLOITING the cloying, vicious potential of a mother-son bond gone
wrong, this is a harrowing portrayal of the most dismal dysfunctional
family, a relationship so soured that it has to be fated, and which does
indeed come to a particularly nasty conclusion.
A brittle, brilliant script by Raymond J Barry careens through a
myriad of themes, constantly hurling disparate and distressing images at
the audience. Lines are delivered at breakneck speed and simultaneously,
and the cast's command of them is no small accomplishment.
Pitched at a consistent hysterical level, it induces the strongest of
responses and that the most predominant one is revulsion is merely an
indication of the play's accomplishment, successfully planting sinister
seeds in  the most innocent of lines which flower into full-scale
horror. Horrible and perverted, this is breathtaking theatre.

Ferrol, Spain
THE centrepiece of a giant #250m jigsaw which, when complete, will
bring ashore the first oil from the new west of Shetland province, slid
into the waters of northern Spain yesterday.
As 14,500 tonnes of steel eased down the slipway of the Astana yard
into Ferrol Bay, it marked a milestone in the development of the UK's
newest oil frontier more than 20 years after it was first discovered.
The launch of the middle section of the Petrogarl Foinaven is the
first tangible sign that the technology that was not available to
exploit the new Atlantic province when it was first found has now
arrived.
The floating production, storage, and offshore loading facility (FPSO)
is a unique engineering project. On completion, the Petrogarl Foinaven
will be part ship, part crude oil and gas processing plant, and part
storage unit.
The former Russian submarine support vessel Anadyr has been cut in
three in the Astana yard in Ferrol, the birthplace of General Franco.
Its mid-section has been removed and will be replaced by a new hi-tech
section, including a turret which will be anchored to the sea bed by 10
massive chains and around which the vessel will rotate to enable it to
withstand Atlantic storms that could include 30-metre waves.
The turret, the most challenging of its kind yet to be built in
Britain, was constructed at the McDermott yard at Ardersier.
''This was a first for the north-east of Scotland and the first turret
of this complexity to be built in the UK and I would like to acknowledge
their courage in taking that job on,'' said Mr Colin Maclean, BP's asset
manager for the Atlantic province.
The mid-section is now constructed and, following the launch, work
will start to weld it to the modified bow and stern sections of the
former Anadyr.
When that work is done, the jigsaw will be completed by fitting 18
modules of vital equipment, weighing almost 4000 tonnes, on the top.
The average time for a North Sea project from discovery of a field to
the production of first oil is around nine years, but Foinaven is on
schedule to cut that by almost two-thirds.
Mr Maclean said the plan had been to complete the project at a rate
which would ''stun'' the industry.
It is actually less than 10 months since the go-ahead was given for
the #750m project and it is already 70% complete.
The Petrogarl Foinaven will be operated by its owners, Golar-Nor
Offshore, experts in FPSOs, and it will produce around 200 million
barrels of Foinaven's reserves.
Mr Joe Leghorn, BP's Foinaven project manager, described it as ''an
unprecedented achievement in a new frontier''. New subsea technology has
had to be developed for the field because the water depth is 500 metres
and the sea bed is beyond the reach of divers.

Grace Franklin joins a powerful lobby of 30,000 women in Beijing.
MORE than 200 women who travelled by train for eight days to attend
the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, arrived in Beijing
yesterday.
They included women from several emerging countries in Central and
Eastern Europe --Albania among them. The journey was supported by
various nations including the UK, Ireland and Canada.
The British Council was also a sponsoring organisation and the UN
Development Programme was behind the idea and provided the bulk of the
funding. Those who set off from Warsaw, included academics and activists
who took time to discuss issues on the agenda of the Beijing conference.
They also prepared for the UN Forum for Women which precedes the UN
government conference to be staged from Monday to Sept 15.
Among the band of train travellers was Vanessa Vadin, daughter of Jane
Fonda. Vanessa, who filmed the journey, said: ''We thought eight days
and nights on a train would be difficult. But we ended up wanting to
spend another two days at least, just to talk.''
An activist in her own right, Vanessa said: ''I found the experience
heartwarming. At every stop we were met with official receptions. Women,
in particular, gave us bread, often still warm from the oven.
''This is symbolic. Not only does it show warmth, friendship and
hospitality, it illustrates women giving each other sustenance. They
were saying 'take our message to Beijing'.''
The message being brought by the 30,000 women who have descended on
China from around the world is that they want action on promises of
equality development and peace made to women.
Since China has discreetly placed the forum in the pretty lakeside
country town of Huairou, a good half hour's journey from Beijing where
the formal government conference is sited, the women will have a more
difficult time lobbying for the actions they want included in the final
document.
Most delegates agree the UN conference is being used by the big powers
as a pawn in their game. This preliminary forum is where
non-governmental organisations get together to lobby the government
conference and try to change the wording of the vital document it
produces.
From today till September 8, the monstrous regiment of women milling
around this hastily enlarged town, will ''Look at the world through
women's eyes''. What they see already of China is to the liking of some
and not too impressive to others.
At the official registration centre passes were issued with Chinese
administrative thoroughness -- a long line of clerks each requiring a
different bit of paper on which to log some new nugget of information.
There followed a scuffle for shuttle buses to transport lucky pass
holders to their digs.
Since another long line of paper pushers had to be satisfied before
accommodation was allocated, and since this task was done out in the
open in the heat of the day, some of the women who had already been
travelling for days from places such as Kenya were more than tired.
Many of the black and Asian women have already been treated with less
than the standard Chinese courtesy -- sent on the wrong buses or given
more expensive accommodation. But if there is latent racism, the forum
women will soon root it out.
While these first few days are for settling-in and locating the
essentials such as food, toilets and meeting places, they also set the
scene in a fundamental way. For smiles at this stage can reduce tension
and tantrums later when everyone's minds are fixed firmly on the words
which will be haggled over with governments to ensure women's peace and
equality become realities.
NGO forums at each of the three previous World Conference on Women --
in Mexico, Copenhagen and Nairobi -- have served as rallying points for
women worldwide, and have seen the beginnings of important women's
networks and organisations.
Huairou could be the reinforcement of this -- with a little help from
Scotland. Because a tapestry woven by women on Arran wilI be displayed
at the today's opening along with several hundred other works of art
from around the world. And a display of Scottish country dancing should
take place if the taped music can be retrieved from luggage lost by Air
France.
Diplomatically, China has nothing to do with that -- so it still puts
smiles on the faces of its curious visitors. That is, until the music
starts in earnest and the words become fundamental stepping stones on
the road to a better future.

Following the crash yesterday of a secret plane, Defence Correspondent
Ian Bruce discusses the U2's history.
THE U2 spy plane is a veteran warhorse which first flew in 1954 as
part of a frantic American programme to keep tabs on Soviet missile
development and deployment as the Cold War threatened to turn hot at any
moment. Over the next four decades, the aircraft, little more than a
high-speed glider, mounted hundreds of deep penetration missions into
the USSR. One in five of the early sorties had RAF pilots at the
controls, often from British bases under US operational control.
Its existence remained a secret until May 1960, when CIA pilot Gary
Powers was shot down by a Soviet missile over the Urals and captured
before he had a chance to destroy his aircraft or its surveillance
equipment. Soviet leader Nikita Kruschev laid on a show trial and
succeeded in embarrassing Washington internationally.
Less well known is the fact that the CIA established its first U2 base
at RAF Lakenheath in 1956 and struck a clandestine deal with the British
which meant that authorisation for spy flights was effectively removed
from US government control.
If the US President of the day vetoed a mission, the CIA could turn to
the Prime Minister to circumvent the problem. Since the RAF and the
Secret Intelligence Service were so closely involved, Premiers such as
Sir Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan often sanctioned the flights and
assigned RAF personnel to the task.
The USSR's growing stockpile of atomic weapons meant that the Western
nuclear powers desperately needed targeting information for their own
strike forces to counter the threat. The U2 provided the solution until
the 1960 shoot-down demonstrated its vulnerability to modern
high-altitude missiles. But even that incident failed to halt spy
flights.
U2 detachments were established at Incirlik in Turkey, Bodo in Norway,
Wiesbaden in West Germany, and at Atsugi in Japan. All of its pilots
were ostensibly civilians employed by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.
All were, in fact, employed by the CIA, including the RAF crews on
attachment. One RAF pilot, Squadron Leader Christopher Walker, was
killed on a training mission in Texas in 1958.
Apart from the Powers incident, the US, Britain, and the USSR waged a
largely secret intelligence war. More than 30 US aircraft were lost on
such missions and 140 crewmen killed in clashes which went largely
unreported.
They were the unsung casualties of a Cold War fought over barren
mountain ranges and icy seas as each side probed its opponents'
defences.
And it was not one-sided. Between 1962 and 1964 alone, there were more
than 90 Soviet incursions into West German air space.
By the mid-1960s, the U2 had outlived its survivability over
heavily-defended Soviet territory. However, it continued to provide
photographic intelligence over much of Eastern Europe, the Middle East,
and Cuba. U2 overflights provided the first definitive evidence of a
Soviet missile build-up on the island in 1962, bringing the world to the
brink of nuclear holocaust.
For eight days, the US and the USSR stood toe to toe. Soviet warships
headed for the Caribbean, escorting missile transports. The US Navy drew
a symbolic line in the sea and warned Moscow to cross it at its peril.
President Kennedy put the U2 still shots of missile launchers before
the UN and called Kruschev's bluff. The Soviets backed down at the last
moment. As one senior American politician remarked: ''We were eyeball to
eyeball and the other guy just blinked.''
The technological explosion of the late sixties and early seventies
reduced the U2 to second-line service as surveillance satellites were
developed. But these had, and still have, serious limitations.
It is possible to photograph with perfect clarity an object a few
inches across from 30,000 miles above the earth. The trick is to have a
satellite in orbit over the desired area at the crucial time.
Satellites also have a limited lifespan of between a few days and a
few months and an even more limited stock of fuel for manoeuvring in
space to attain a new orbit. More importantly, they can carry only so
much film to be ejected over pre-arranged points for collection.
Given the profusion of world flashpoints, the need for definitive,
reliable photographic intelligence at short notice remains vital to all
major powers. A range of supersonic spy planes such as Lockheed's SR71s
Blackbird and the ultra-secret Aurora are still on the US military
inventory.
Unmanned vehicles were thought to be the perfect answer to the
reconnaissance dilemma as anti-aircraft weaponry has steadily improved.
One of the latest US models, the Predator, is the equivalent of a very
large model aircraft equipped with high-resolution video and stills
cameras for battlefield surveillance.
The Predator's controller sits at a video arcade-style console up to
500 miles away and steers the craft over the target area with a
joystick, filming chosen items or key positions in perfect personal
safety.
No pilot equates with no high-propaganda-value hostage or embarrassing
body-bag. And unlike the F16 rescue mission launched earlier this year
in Bosnia, its loss in action does not require a 40-aircraft effort to
remedy.
Five of these were deployed secretly to Gjader air base in Albania
last month to provide targeting and reconnaissance information for Nato
warplanes over Bosnia. Two have been lost in recent weeks and further
missions have been cancelled in the meantime.
The USAF refuses to say whether the still-experimental Predators were
shot down or succumbed to mechanical failure, but it is understood that
at least one was given a self-destruct signal to prevent its
state-of-the-art sensors falling into Serb hands.
That was the prime reason for authorisation of yesterday's manned U2
flight to pinpoint certain batteries around Sarajevo in preparation for
possible Nato airstrikes in retaliation for the latest Serb atrocity in
that besieged city.
The U2 which crashed at RAF Fairford belonged to the USAF 9th
Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, normally based at Beale in California.
The squadron's specialist role is precision location of targets.
RAF Fairford itself, ostensibly mothballed since the withdrawal of
major US air forces from the UK, is no stranger to ''black'' operations.
As a former home to aircraft of the US Strategic Air Command, it now
leads a shadowy existence as sometime host to US spy missions worldwide.

WHO speaks for Scottish business? It's one of those questions being
kicked around on the chat shows this week in the wake of Lex Gold's
decision to vacate his desk at CBI Scotland.
Ever since the tragically premature demise of John Davidson, the CBI
seems to have been struggling north of the Border.
Gold, along with chairman, IBM's John Ward, have made something of a
comeback with their manufacturing initiative and the well thought-out
Scottish Business Agenda but too often callers seeking a CBI comment are
referred to Centrepoint, the organisation's all-powerful UK
headquarters.
In particular, the CBI has failed to produce more than a negative
knee-jerk response to the prospect of devolution, failing to reflect the
mosaic of Scottish business opinion on this subject.
Is this because the CBI lacks a proper Scottish voice? Yes, says
Hamish Morrison, of the Scottish Council Development &amp; Industry: ''The
CBI is essentially a British organisation. If devolution comes, they can
just walk away. We can't.''
But the Scottish Council too had its problems, its functions largely
usurped by other agencies and organisations. The Institute of Directors
is, like the CBI, a national organisation.
The Federation of Small Businesses and the Forum of Private Business
have both campaigned vigorously on some Scottish issues but lack the
resources of the big city-based Chambers of Commerce.
The chambers are attempting to come together a speak for the whole of
Scottish business via their Association of Scottish Chambers of
Commerce, challenging CBI Scotland as the voice of Scottish business.
The question remains as to whether they can bury past arguments over
issues such as infrastructure investment.
Perhaps the whole question is a futile one. After all, can one really
expect a one-man ice cream business to share the same perspective as
ScottishPower? So, though at first the business of representing Scottish
business seems rather overcrowded, thoughtful observers believe we need
their several and sometimes contradictory voices because of the subtly
different constituencies they represent. Here's a brief run-down of the
six main ones:
* CBI Scotland -- Director: Lex Gold (until later this year).
Based in Glasgow, CBI Scotland speaks mostly for Scotland's large and
multinational companies. The confederation is strongly centralised. The
Scottish office with its director and five assistant directors
(including two secondees) is answerable to the British headquarters with
200 staff at the notorious Centrepoint building in London.
Supporters of this structure say the size and strength of the UK
operation enables it to tackle key areas of policy in depth and pack a
powerful punch with Government. Detractors say it has prevented the CBI
from developing and articulating a distinctive Scottish voice on such
issues as devolution.
In the past the CBI has tended to be strongly identified with the
Conservatives. However, at both Scottish and UK level the CBI has been
critical of some Government policy recently. CBI Scotland's Scottish
Business Agenda attracted support from right across the political
spectrum. The CBI's Brussels office and its membership of UNICE (the
European Employers' Federation) gives it a voice in Europe.
* Association of Scottish Chambers of Commerce -- Director General:
Charles Winter, absent throughillness. Acting DG: Peter Dunn, a past
president of Fife Chamber of Commerce.
Based in the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, the Association is trying
to build its reputation as a voice for Scottish business. Chambers are
strongly localised and members are mostly small and medium-sized
businesses. City branches are strongly associated with retailing and
many have long histories. Glasgow's was founded in 1783.
Some question whether the chambers are sufficiently united to speak
with a single voice. In the past there have been numerous inter-chamber
disputes, eg over airport policy. Because they can't support themselves
on membership fees alone, Chambers of Commerce are attempting to sell to
the business communities an ever-expanding range of services, eg export
advice, personnel training and information services.
They would like to make themselves more powerful and indispensable by
remodelling themselves on the French and German models. There it is
compulsory to register a business with the local chamber of commerce.
But this is fiercely opposed by other business organisations who believe
it would give the chambers too much power.
* Scottish Office of the Federation of Small Businesses -- Federation
Scottish Secretary: Bill Anderson.
Known affectionately as ''The Federation of Small Bills,'' after its
vertically challenged but energetic director, it changed its name from
the Federation of Self-Employed Businessmen. Part of a branch network
with 70,000 members all over Britain, it is both a lobbying organisation
but also offers a range of services to members, including free legal and
tax advice. The federation has campaigned on a number of Scottish issues
including rail services and the uniform business rate. Attended the
Scottish Consitutional Convention on the basis that Scottish business
should be represented at such gatherings if the business community is to
have a voice in the devolution debate.
* The Forum of Private Business -- Scottish spokesman: Jim Gorie.
Based in the Helensburgh home of its spokesman, the forum is part of a
UK network founded in 1977 and based on a similar business organisation
in the US which boasts over 1,000,000 members. It is purely a lobbying
organisation, entirely dependent on subscriptions and regularly consults
its 23,000 UK members on a range of issues via quarterly surveys and
referenda. Copies of replies go to local MPs.
The forum has recently mounted a vigorous campaign against late
payment. Gorie complains that since John Davidson sad demise, CBI
Scotland has become ineffective -- ''a small tail on the Centrepoint
dog.'' The Forum has criticised the CBI and he Chambers of Commerce for
''a lack of hard thinking on the impact of either devolution or the
changes in Europe''.
* The Scottish Office of the Institute of Directors -- Director:
Donald Hardie.
A small two-person office based in Edinburgh, with six area committees
which arrange social and educational programmes around the country for
individual directors and partners in professional firms. For example,
the Dundee branch's autumn programme includes a dinner with Lord
Parkinson amd a visit to the Highland Spring plant.
The IOD, with its plush offices in Pall Mall, is influential at the UK
level but has a low profile in Scotland, though it supported the
campaign against late payment. One observer described its input as
''gentlemanly and reflective''. A muted voice.
* The Scottish Council Development &amp; Industry -- Chief Executive:
Hamish Morrison.
Illustrious past, including the organisation of the 1938 Empire
Exhibition, but the Council has fallen on hard times recently as other
business organisations have nibbled away at their patch. They used to
have a brief for attracting inward investment until this was taken away
by the Scottish Development Agency.
They still deal with stimulating exports but this function is
threatened by the emergence of the Scottish Trade International arm of
Scottish Enterprise. Still employ 32 paid staff in Edinburgh and
Glasgow.
Morrison claims the council is different from other organisations
because of the involvement of the unions and local authorities. ''We
speak for economic development, rather than business per se,'' he says.
This gives them a distinctive voice on, for example, employment. As an
all-Scottish organisation the council can and does express views on
Anglo-Scottish issues, such as the ScottishPower bid for ManWeb, while
the CBI and other hover on the sidelines.
The council organises what is still probably the most important annual
conference for Scottish businessmen, the Scottish Forum at Gleneagles
Hotel, though these days top people tend to send their corporate affairs
directors.

New York
A NATURAL fat-buster that made headlines last month for slimming down
overweight mice may not do the same for really obese people, new
research suggests.
Scientists found evidence that very fat people already have high
levels of that substance in their bodies, maybe 20 to 30 times the
amount found in slender people.
So injecting more may not help at all, said researcher Bradford
Hamilton.
But another scientist, Stephen Burley, who studies the substance
disagreed, saying the new findings may just mean that the obese need
more of the stuff than other people to control their weight.
The substance, called leptin, is produced by fat tissue. Mouse studies
suggest it is a messenger to the brain that lets animals keep a
relatively constant weight.
The more fat on an animal, according to the theory, the more leptin it
produces and the more reaches the brain. If an animal gets too obese, an
excess of leptin signals the brain to curb appetite and burn off fat.
Scientists say many processes, biological and social, influence
obesity, and leptin is not the total answer.
Last month, scientists reported experiments with mice that were
grossly overweight because they could not make leptin. When the animals
were injected with leptin, they slimmed down dramatically.--AP.

GOVERNMENT cuts in housing investment over the last six years have
deprived Scotland of 21,000 houses, according to Shelter Scotland.
The housing charity said yesterday that this investment had declined
in real terms by 26% since 1989. Over the next two years, further cuts
of 11% were planned by the Scottish Office.
Mr Gavin Corbett, Shelter's research and information officer, said
housing had suffered more than any other part of public spending. If
funding had remained at 1989 levels, Shelter estimated that the
additional 21,000 homes could have been built.
Housing had been regarded as a soft target and this was ''indefensible
and shortsighted'', he claimed.
The message was clear: housing had suffered enough. Cuts meant
homelessness, investment meant homes and jobs.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said the Government had to balance the
demand with what could be afforded, taking account of competing demands
on the public purse such as health and education.
A total of 300,000 new dwellings had been built since 1979, about
220,000 of them by the private sector, and there had been record numbers
of private sector house completions in both 1993 and 1994.

Goma, Zaire
ZAIRE today gave the UN refugee agency four months to send home the
1000,000 Rwandan Hutus on its soil, backing away from its threat of
immediate expulsions.
Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said after Geneva talks with UN
High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata that Zaire would assess
progress monthly and retain the right to deport refugees left behind at
the start of 1996.
Tension in the Rwandan government came to a head with the sackings of
four Ministers said to be opposed to the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic
Army (RPA) plans to put soldiers on committees overseeing the return of
refugees from Zaire.
Parliament sacked Justice Minister Alphonse Nkubito, Interior Minister
Seth Sendashonga, Information Minister Jean-Baptiste Nkuriyingoma, and
Transport and Telecommunication Minister Imaculee Kayumba over the
dispute.
Yesterday moderate Hutu premier Faustin Twagiramungu was sacked for
alleged incompetence. His departure sowed more terror among refugees
fearing reprisals at the hands of the RPA for last year's genocide of up
to 1000,000 Tutsis and allied Hutus.
Three of the sacked Ministers are Hutus. Although their successors
have yet to be named, their departure is certain to play into the hands
of Hutu extremists in refugee camps eager to portray the Rwandan
government as anti-Hutu, diplomats said.
The peaceful return of Hutu refugees to Rwanda is critical to the
credibility of the Tutsi-led government. The international community has
promised further aid to the government depending on its track record on
refugees.
Zaire's decision has eased the pressure on the UNHCR, giving it until
the end of the year to repatriate the Rwandan refugees voluntarily.
''Repatriation must be en masse, without interruption and end by
December 31, 1995 at the latest. In case . . . repatriation is delayed
beyond December 31, Zaire reserves the right to make the refugees leave
its territory,'' Mr wa Dondo told a news conference after talks in
Geneva today.
In the Zairean border town of Goma, UNHCR spokesman Chris Bowers said
UNHCR would do its best to escort the refugees home but it could not
commit itself to a rigid deadline.
''We will mobilise all possible resources in the region and do all we
can to send refugees back, but we cannot commit ourselves to
deadlines,'' he said.
Mr Patrick de Souza, UNHCR's chief in Bukavu, said today's decision in
Geneva would give a further sense of urgency to the return of refugees
and an impetus to find a solution to their problems.
''It gives an understanding that it is safer to return voluntarily
with UNHCR rather than be forced out by the Zairean government and we
hope we can implement the return,'' he said.
Zaire suspended the expulsions last Thursday after throwing 15,000
Rwandan and Burundian refugees out but five days of UN voluntary
repatriation has sent home fewer than 400 refugees.
General Ian Douglas, the Canadian commander of UN-paid Zairean forces
guarding refugee camps, said the international community must back
initiatives to get repatriation going.
''There's a lot of combined joint work to be done if now we've got
until the end of the year. They (Zaireans) have made it clear that's
probably as long as we've got,'' he said.
He added that bases of the former Rwandan military where Hutu
militants have been spreading terror stories about refugees being
slaughtered on their return to Rwanda had to be closed.
In camps near Goma, however, refugees vowed never to go back and
recounted tales of Hutus returning to Rwanda having their eyes scooped
out or being choked to death.
Only 22 refugees out of 150,000 in Mugunga went home today
voluntarily. UN trucks also went to camps in the Bukavu region but no
refugees boarded them.
Refugees said the dismissal of Rwanda's Prime Minister and the four
Ministers was proof that Hutus were not wanted.-- Reuter.

A LEADING Scots theologian yesterday claimed there was still a huge
way to go in overcoming the ''sense of alienation'' which was
articulated so forcefully by the Christian feminist voice.
Mrs Elizabeth Templeton, a member of the Church of Scotland, was
speaking on the second day of the European Area Council meeting of World
Alliance of Reformed Churches in Edinburgh.
She told the meeting the very existence of a day where there was a
split agenda for men and women delegates had been a cause of
''heartsearching, controversy, and some pain''.
Mrs Templeton said she was not convinced there were any interesting
topics which were women's issues but not men's issues, or vice versa.
''In spite of the Decade of Solidarity with Women, or maybe even
because of it, I find that a great deal of the explicit discussion of
'women's issues' happens with a measure of male cynicism and distrust.''
She said she had overheard conversations where men talked with relief
about having got through sessions to do with women's agendas and there
was a ''dismissive and even contemptuous'' feeling.
She had also been present at women's groups where there was a
triumphalist atmosphere of working on their own without ''these
power-crazed autocratic men''.
''Both of these stances seem to me shameful and sub-Christian,'' she
said.
The theologian said that quite apart from the tactical, practical
question of what the outcome was likely to be if separate agendas
continued to be encouraged, it was inappropriate as a theological
symbol.
''I am sure that graceful co-existence must transcend the kind of
self-consciousness which bedevils so much of the relationships between
men and women, especially when we meet to discuss gender issues,'' she
said.

A SENIOR Orkney council official has been made redundant and another
suspended as the authority yesterday announced an investigation into the
operation of its direct services organisation.
The islands council refused to say whether or not other redundancies,
suspensions, or dismissals were pending but a senior councillor warned
that the authority would be ruthless if the investigation unearthed any
wrong-doing.
It is understood that the official made redundant is Mr John Drew,
manager of the DSO.
It is believed the officer suspended pending the outcome of the
investigation is senior sewerage department engineer Peter Armstrong.
However, a council spokesman refused to confirm the redundancy and
suspension. ''The council is unable to comment on staff matters such as
the reasons behind suspensions, redundancies, and dismissals,'' he said.
Earlier this month, the council did confirm that builders from the DSO
wearing council overalls had been seen working on Mr Armstrong's home in
Evie.
At that time, the council spokesman said the authority was satisfied
there was nothing improper about the arrangement.
It was a private arrangement between Mr Armstrong and the men, who
were not doing the work in the council's time, said the spokesman.
Yesterday, the council issued a short statement announcing that an
inquiry was under way.
''Orkney Islands Council has confirmed that it is currently conducting
an internal investigation into a number of matters relating to the
operation of its direct services organisation and the difficulties
within the DSO which have already been well publicised,'' it said.
''Until such times as this investigation is concluded, it is not
possible for the council to discuss this matter further, particularly in
relation to the individuals concerned.''
The spokesman refused to say whether or not the well-publicised
difficulties included Mr Armstrong's use of DSO builders at his home.
But he said: ''There has been no disciplinary action to date in
connection with that matter.''
The findings of the inquiry will be reported to the contract services
committee.
Chairman Eoin Scott said yesterday: ''Substantial inquiries are
proceeding. The committee are all of the opinion that we will be quite
ruthless if -- and I emphasise if -- any impropriety is found.''

THE political row over the
the transfer of houses from Irvine Development Corporation to a
housing assocation which it helped to set up deepened yesterday.
The corporation announced that it had sold the first batch of 285
houses to Irvine Housing Association for more than #2.5m. Local MP Brian
Donohoe dismissed the move as a ''black day for Irvine'' while the
corporation's managing director described it as ''good news for tenants
now and in the future''.
Mr Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, has campaigned against the
transfer of houses to the association, which he has described as a front
for unwelcome and unacceptable Tory housing policies.
For several months,the corporation and the association, which is now
independent, having been assisted in the early stages,have been
negotiating over the transfer of 769 houses,which is expected to take
place by next spring.
The development corporation will be wound up by early 1997 and its
industrial stock has already moved into private control. Tenants in the
corporation's 3500 houses will be asked next year to choose a new
landlord in a ballot.
With the withdrawal of two outside housing agencies, the choice is
expected to be between Cunninghame District Council and Irvine Housing
Association.
Mr Jack Murdoch, managing director of Irvine Development Corporation,
said: ''I am surprised and disappointed at Mr Donohoe's continuing
criticism of our involvement with Irvine Housing Association. We have
made no secret of the fact that, in order to make the association a
viable choice for tenants, it must have housing stock and show that it
can manage that stock.
''We were told by independent consultants from the outset that it
would be preferable to have a local housing association created rather
than have associations from outside in the ballot.''
''For that reason, we helped the association to get started and are
now involved in an exercise to transfer housing to them in time for the
ballot. I believe the tenants will get the same kind of high standard of
service under the association that they have enjoyed for many years
under the corporation.'' Mr Donohoe responded:''I find it despicable
that the corporation is embarking on this naked attempt to give this
housing association some kind of kudos in the housing market and to
pretend that it will have some kind of experience and business acumen.
''I am also concerned at the low prices which these houses are going
for -- under #9000 each -- as there is no guarantee that they will not
ultimately be sold on at greatly inflated prices.''
Mr Donohoe wants a Commons debate this autumn on the whole question of
housing ballots and will call on Scottish Office Ministers to come clean
on the controversial practice.
He added: ''I believe that Raymond Robertson and his Scottish Office
cronies should be held personally responsible for this fiasco and should
be surcharged to make up for what could be a huge waste of money.''
Mr Murdoch said: ''If Mr Donohoe had any idea about how the price of
these houses is worked out, he would realise that it is not based on the
market value but on a formula based on the projected rental and costs on
the property.''
Housing association chairman Ms Jeanette Mason said: ''As we have now
bought our first houses, we will give the people who live in them a
service which cannot be bettered.

WATER bailiffs yesterday described a huge net they dragged from a busy
harbour as a ''death trap''.
They said the poachers' net could have cost the life of a swimmer.
The bailiffs in Ayr are now hunting those responsible.
The poachers fled while laying the net, the largest found on the west
coast, after they were spotted by bailiffs on routine night patrol.
''This thing was incredible,'' said Mr Robert McFarlane, of Ayr
District Salmon Fishery Board. He said it was 350ft by 12ft, making it
longer ''than Hampden football pitch''.
He added: ''Anything that got entangled in it just wouldn't have stood
a chance. It could easily have stopped a boat for instance if its
propeller had became jammed in the mesh.
''Basically we just couldn't believe anyone would be so stupid as to
lay something like this in a busy harbour.''
Bailiffs believe poachers laid the trap to ensnare salmon which were
moving upstream to spawn.
Only one fish was found when it was hauled ashore.
''Luckily we got the net out before any real damage was done,'' said
Mr McFarlane. ''But I hate to think of the possible disaster it could
have caused had it been left there overnight or longer.''
A board spokesman said anyone caught poaching in this manner could be
fined up to #2500 or face a lengthy jail term.

A BROAD hint that the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 -- which received
Royal Assent in July -- will be operational as close as possible to
inauguration of the new single-tier authorities was given in Glasgow
yesterday by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State at the
Scottish Office.
Lord James avoided giving a precise date for implementation but told a
Children In Scotland conference on the Act that it would be introduced
''without undue delay'' while undertaking to consult with those agencies
involved in its implementation.
He added that speedy and positive contributions on implementation
would enable all involved to ''realise the opportunity offered by the
new Act and a new system of local government to introduce a new era of
child law and services for the benefit of Scotland's children''.
Lord James also announced the publication of a guide to the Act which
would set out clearly the themes and principles running through it and
the provision for responsibilities, rights, duties, and powers which it
contains.
He said he hoped it would prove particularly helpful to the members of
the new councils as they took on their social work responsibilities.
Both the Minister and Mrs Maria Fyfe MP, Labour spokeswoman on social
work in Scotland, paid tribute to the unique all-party support for the
child-centred principle of the Bill. This speeded its passage through
the legislative process but Mrs Fyfe argued that further improvements
should still be sought.
Among them should be clarification of the question of physical
punishment of children and of the rights of single mothers, she said.
Mrs Fyfe welcomed the right of children to have their views considered
when major decisions were taken about their lives and the possibility of
excluding certain individuals from a children's hearing, which she
described as ''a great advance for children who have been abused''.
She also welcomed ''the radical step of creating exclusion orders,
including emergency orders, so that an alleged abuser may be removed
from the family home rather than the child''.
Lord James added that the Act placed increased emphasis on the rights
and responsibilities of parents even after separation and divorce.

George Hume on the market forces hampering research into clean-energy
wave power.
THE leader of an internationally-acclaimed Scottish research team says
government parsimony and market forces dogma are pushing the successful
delivery of renewable energy from wave power far into the next century.
Professor Stephen Salter of Edinburgh University, who has had a senior
member of his team poached by Japanese industry because there is no
money to pay him, says it could be as long as 40 years before wave power
is established in this country -- and then only after all reserves of
natural gas have been exhausted.
Wave-power research began in Britain 22 years ago, received Government
funding for only eight years, and has only recently won financial
support from the EC. But, according to Professor Salter, wave power,
properly exploited, could meet Britain's entire domestic and industrial
energy needs.
''The Government's policy is to have no policy and to let market
forces have their way. The market, of course, prefers to do what it can
do immediately and that is burn gas,'' he says.
Projected costs for wave power, however, are high -- pointing to bills
at least twice the target level. ''We will just have to be twice as
clever, see rougher seas -- which we have in recent years, or have the
cost of gas go up,'' says Professor Salter.
The energy crisis of 1973, brought about by the Yom Kippur War in the
Middle East, saw the start of wave-power research in Britain. Government
funding -- ''steady and adequate,'' according to Professor Salter -- ran
from the following year until 1982 and then dried up.
Over the years Government support amounted to #17m and covered
research into 12 devices. The Department of Trade and Industry now makes
no contribution to the research programmes that continue . . . one of
them on Islay. The device, developed by academics in Belfast, has so far
survived several heavy winters.
Not until three years ago did the EC put up funds after the admission
to the European Union of Spain, Portugal and Ireland -- countries which
considerably enlarged the European coastline and the scope for wave
energy generation. Portugal was at the fore in pressing for financial
support.
''We have had eight years of proper funding from the Government and,
prior to the EC money, 12 years of fiddling to keep wave-energy research
alive,'' said Professor Salter who claims, however, not to be
despondent.
''Frank Whittle invented the jet engine in 1929 but the first Boeing
707 did not carry passengers until 1959. These things take time. But
there is no doubt that wave-energy research is poorly co-ordinated and
spasmodic although it is moving.''
EC funding for wave-energy research at Edinburgh University amounts to
800,000 ECUs -- about #660,000 -- which is currently being employed on
the development and production of a variable pitch turbine that will be
fitted towards the end of the century in a Portuguese wave research
development in the Azores.
Wave-energy research is being carried out in a number of countries
outside Europe -- including China, India, and Japan.
Britain's natural gas reserves are estimated at around 15 years at
present levels of consumption, with the prospect of a further 10 years
worth being found in the waters west of Shetland. Thereafter supplies
would most likely have to be bought in from Algeria and states formerly
in the Soviet Union -- current political instability in these countries
puts a question mark on the future reliability of supply.
''Our present policy is to burn gas as fast as we can -- something
only a maniac or a marketeer would do. It is extremely difficult for
renewable energies to compete with fossil fuels -- after all, one only
has to burn them,'' says Professor Salter.
''Only when the gas is exhausted in maybe 20, 30, or 40 years time
will renewable wave energy come into its own. We should be doing the
research now ahead of the need. Wave-energy research in laboratory is
very cheap, and the three on my team deliver very high value.
''Wave energy is big, renewable, in no-one's way and without pollution
-- a prize well worth putting in a tiny amount of money for. But here we
have market forces, what can be done immediately with no thought for the
future,'' he says.
According to research figures wave energy from 10km of sea-front can
produce the equivalent output of a large power station. With 900km of
coastline round Britain, sufficient energy could, it is claimed, be won
from wave power to meet the country's total demand.
A scheme is already on the drawing board that envisages wave-energy
generators running from Cape Wrath to Valencia in Spain -- broken only
by sea lanes for shipping. The possibility of wave-energy generation as
far north as Iceland -- a submarine cable being used to bring the
electricity to Britain -- is also being considered.
Osprey, which sank off Dounreay in hurricane force winds at the
weekend is involved with Edinburgh University in the production of the
variable pitch turbine that will be fitted to the Portuguese wave
station in the Azores.
The site for the #4m Osprey, launched on the Clyde at the start of
this month, was chosen because of the power of the waves in the Pentland
Firth. It was expected to be able to feed 275kw in the national grid.
''(It was) a public relations disaster and everyone in the wave
community is extremely embarrassed,'' said Professor Salter. ''But it
was not the waves that upset it -- rather something to do with
seamanship or at the yard, and I have been told that until it went down
everything was working well. It will go again and we have learned
lessons rather quicker, perhaps, than we had planned.''

A SCHOOL which opened in 1836 with 10 young ladies on the roll
yesterday welcomed 10 members of the opposite sex to its senior ranks.
Wellington School, in Ayr, is going co-educational officially with the
start of the new session.
Headmistress Dianne Gardner is enthusiastic about the new development:
''There is a strong case for co-education in the modern world. Life
itself is co-educational.''
The move, which follows successful trials in the junior school, brings
the total number of boys at Wellington to 50.
It is one of many changes in the school's world. Mrs Gardner says few
companies are now prepared to meet the boarding school fees of the
families of expatriate executives.
Though she is reluctant to see boarding pupils disappear, she admits
that shrinking numbers, down from 120 in the early 1970s to this year's
22, will require some rethinking: ''We may buy a house and instal a
house mother to run it.''
The co-educational school has no endowments to provide for bursary
places but, of the present roll of just under 400, 40 are to receive
assistance with fees.

<HEADLINE>Doctors discover diabetes 'marker'</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A DISCOVERY that could lead to a major advance towards the prevention
of insulin-dependent diabetes was announced by British scientists today.
Researchers have found a molecular ''marker'' which will help pinpoint
in advance people likely to develop the disease.
A statement from the British Diabetic Association, said: ''By
signposting the way forward for further scientific research, it could
eventually lead to a breakthrough in the prevention of diabetes among
future generations.''
The key to the discovery lies in the way antibodies in people with
diabetes attack cells which would normally discharge insulin, the
hormone that controls blood sugar levels.
This leaves the victim with a shortage of insulin, which then has to
be given artificially through daily injections.
The ''marker'', a protein called IA-2, identifies a particular
component in the molecular structure of the cells which acts as a target
for the antibodies.
Three years ago, researchers in America found another target marker,
an enzyme called GAD. However, the discovery was of limited use because
antibodies which react to GAD are also present in people unlikely to
develop diabetes.
The new marker is thought to pinpoint much more accurately people at
risk of having diabetes.
The research, funded by the BDA, the Royal Society, and the Juvenile
Diabetes Foundation, was carried out by a team at the Department of
Medicine at King's College, London.

<HEADLINE>Scottish rural workers and women still losing out on pay</HEADLINE>

WORKERS in Scotland's rural areas earn on average up to #50 per week
less than those on the east coast and #150 less than those in Greater
London, according to a new pay survey.
The report by the Scottish Low Pay Unit also shows that women are
losing the battle to close the pay gap, and the situation has worsened
since the abolition of wages councils.
In a detailed analysis of earnings figures from the Government's New
Earnings Survey, the report says 850,000 workers in Scotland fell below
the unit's low pay threshold.
The survey shows that average weekly earnings among Scottish workers
stands at #300.80, compared with a national average of #325.70, a low of
#291.40 in Wales and a high of #415.50 in Greater London.
However, there also are wide regional variations within Scotland.
Average weekly earnings in Highland are #267.15, in contrast to
#316.20 in Grampian and #298.60 in Lothian.
The highest proportion of men on low pay were in Highland (30%),
Borders (26.3%), and Dumfries and Galloway (25.7%). More than 60% of
women in the same regions earned less than the low pay threshold of
#208.53 per week.
The report also states that 445,000 workers in Scotland would benefit
from the introduction of a minimum wage set at half-median male earnings
(#156.40 per week). Overall, women would account for 78.6% (350,000) of
beneficiaries from a minimum wage.
Ms Morag Gillespie, director of the Scottish Low Pay Unit and author
of the report, said: ''The Government's rationale behind abolishing
wages councils was the belief that low pay was a price worth paying if
more jobs were created.
''Two years on, we see that pay rates are down, and low pay is up, but
where are the jobs?
''There is only one solution to the low-pay crisis, the experts know
it and the public knows it. Britain needs a minimum wage and we need it
now.''
Labour's Scottish employment spokesman, Mr John McFall, MP for
Dumbarton, said the abolition of wages councils was responsible for
driving down wages in sectors where women predominate.
The New Earnings Survey shows that full-time female employees in
Scotland currently earn 72.7% of male earnings, while in
non-professional classes it is nearer 65%.
For 10 years prior to the abolition of wages councils, the pay gap had
hovered around 26% but had now widened in real terms.
Mr McFall accused the Government of being unwilling to close the pay
gap and claimed that current equal pay legislation was inadequate and
too complicated.
''When the Government was forced, in 1981, by the European Commission
to legislate on equal pay for work of equal value, Lord Denning said of
the procedures set up that no ordinary lawyer could understand them,''
he said.
''This has led to the system which encourages employers to engage in
long, drawn-out legal battles. It takes years to get a decision and the
costs can exceed #100,000 -- it is hardly surprising that only around 20
cases are brought each year.''
A second report, published by the Manchester-based Low Pay Network,
shows that nearly 80% of job vacancies formerly covered by wages
councils are now offering poverty pay.
It shows that 78.1% of vacancies in hotel and catering, retail,
clothing manufacture, and hairdressing paid below the amount a family
with two children would receive on Income Support.
About half the full-time jobs and nearly all the part-time jobs in the
study, carried out at 40 Jobcentres around the country, fell into this
category. Nearly 40% paid less than the National Insurance threshold of
#58 a week.
However, Trade and Industry Minister Philip Oppenheim -- who has
responsibility for wages and industrial relations -- hit back, claiming
that wages councils were inflexible to the changing needs of the labour
market and reduced competitiveness.
He said that far from reducing pay levels, wages in sectors formerly
covered by wages councils had risen by 6.3% in real terms since its
abolition in August 1993 and that the Opposition was distorting the
facts.

applications easier for tourists and business visitors.
The system, under which short-term visitors can obtain visas through
accredited travel agents, will be introduced in several more countries
by the end of the year, said Tourism Minister Michael Lee and
Immigration Minister Nick Bolkus yesterday.
The programme will be extended over the next few months to include
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, and
Tahiti. Talks had also started aimed at including South Africa, more
European countries, and North America.
The programme already operates in Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Singapore, Slovenia, and Britain.--Reuter.

Margaret Vaughan finds mature workers winning support as large
companies launch an initiative to stamp out discrimination.
IT wasn't age that withered her, it was the pile of rejections stacked
higgledy-piggledy on the desk. Thirty-four interviews, 33 letters saying
sorry but . . .
''The other one didn't even bother to tell me I hadn't got the job. I
mean, do I look doddery? Decrepit?'' If it wasn't a rhetorical question,
the answer would be no, no she doesn't. ''But that's how I feel now.''
Cathy is 53. University educated, recently widowed, skills updated,
poised and polished right down to her pale lacquered nails. Ready to
return to the world of paid work. Except that the world of paid work
doesn't seem to want her. She's too old.
Cathy knows her capabilities. Convincing potential employers of them
is something else: ''All I wanted was some secretarial work, to ease me
back into it. Three agencies wouldn't even take me on, and although they
didn't come out and admit it, the implication was quite clear: it's your
age, dear.''
Then there were the interviews she did get: ''If I'd got a facelift
and dyed my hair raven, they'd still have been counting the varicose
veins. And if I sound crabbit, it's because I am now. It's just plain
stupid. When you've run a home and brought up four children, frankly,
you're rather better equipped with organisational skills to run a
company than some of those sitting behind the interviewer's desk. And I
only wanted to type their letters . . .''
Exasperated, even if not undaunted, Cathy has given up. She's applied
for a college place to study business administration.
Archie has been made redundant twice. First time round he lost his job
as an insurance executive. After 14 months of searching, he found a post
with an office furniture retailer. It folded eight months after he
joined. ''I think I was lucky to get the second chance, and I worked
hard at it. I don't suppose I'll get another permanent job now. I'm too
old.''
Archie is 48. He plays golf, potters round the greenhouse, watches
Neighbours at lunchtime. He'd like to sign up for nightclasses in
Italian or landscape painting, but says he finds it hard to concentrate:
''I feel useless. Being out of work is, for me, an unnatural state.
Sometimes it feels as if I was born old.''
Later this year, new legislation comes into force to prevent
discrimination against disabled people at work. It will sit alongside
laws already covering discrimination on grounds of sex and race. Which
will leave people like Cathy and Archie, and probably hundreds of
thousands of others, precisely where they stand now. Stranded on the far
shores of 40 with all the other middle-aged labour-force rejects.
Age will become the only major cause of discrimination not covered by
law. Those who find themselves turfed out of full-time work see hope of
re-employment receding faster than gums and hairlines.
Yesterday, around 100 of the UK's biggest companies -- including
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, Costain, the builders, and the National
Westminster Bank -- agreed to back a new initiative that aims to stop
age discrimination in the recruitment of employees. Drawn up by the
Carnegie Third Age Programme, it has resulted in firms changing their
policies to end age discrimination. The initiative has also won support
from the Prime Minister.
A recent report by the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation
identified the trends which led to structural changes in labour markets
in all industrialised countries.
Since the beginning of the eighties, young people have been encouraged
to stay longer in education while older workers were given incentives to
retire early, so reducing the labour supply at both ends.
As unemployment became more acute, a variety of schemes was introduced
to encourage older workers to retire earlier, offering compensation for
loss of earnings and to bridge the gap until pensions could be claimed.
The rate of decline of participation rates of older workers led to a
substantial lowering of the average retirement age.
In a highly competitive jobs market, older workers, women and young
people are most vulnerable to job loss.
In an aggressive cost-cutting and trimming culture of lean, thrusting
companies the more senior posts were simply too costly. But while it's
true that older workers cost more to employ, was there any reason to
believe their performance and the value of their accumulated knowledge
did not compensate for the higher cost? According to the ILO report, no
studies exist to provide a full cost benefit analysis of the employment
of older workers.
In hierarchical systems, such as the civil service, it is true that
earnings rise until the end of working life. That's not true, though, in
technical professions where salaries are linked to output and the peak
of earnings is in mid-career.
But, given the higher cost of some older workers, companies often
found it cheaper to buy them out, or show them the back door. Studies
into the relative productivity rates of older and younger workers seem
to contradict the prevailing ethos that youth always beats age to do the
best job: the ILO survey showed that in industries which want fast
reflexes, precision and acuity of vision -- say, assembling electronic
parts -- productivity starts to decline between the ages of 20 and 30.
In construction, the prime age is between 30 and 40. In the iron and
steel and car industries between 40 and 50. Studies of skilled and
semi-skilled workers in industries such as printing, knitwear, and
service engineering where performance peaks in the late thirties and
forties have found decline in performance is gradual. So that
productivity of those in their late fifties often still exceeds that of
workers in their teens and early twenties.
The young may work with more speed, but they made more mistakes.
Older workers' productivity rates were found to be similar or better
than those of young individuals in tasks which required sustained
attention, and tasks in which the older workers are highly experienced.
In decision making, they may be slower but that is because they have
more information to process and their decisions are often better.
Empirical research shows that because of longer experience, older
workers find ways to compensate for deficiencies and often still
outperform younger workers.
All studies show that older workers forced to retire, made redundant
or just laid off feel excluded from active society, their health may
suffer and they may become withdrawn and unable to adjust to their new
-- non -- status.
Almost all researchers and policy makers now agree, according to the
ILO, that the early retirement trend has gone too far. A point agreed
upon by the Carnegie Programme's director, Richard Worsley, who said
that companies had begun to think more seriously about the artificial
relationship between age and employment: ''Firms are beginning to
recognise every business needs a good mix of ages in its workforce.''

A POLICEMAN has been ordered to pay his former wife #500 a month out
of a pension he is not due to receive until the year 2001.
The court order was made against Mr Derek McEwan, a detective
inspector with Fife Constabulary, despite his plea that he could not
afford to pay.
He argued that the payment should be postponed until he actually
received his pension.
In 1994, Mr McEwan was divorced by his wife, Anne, and Kirkcaldy
Sheriff Gail Patrick found the wife entitled to a capital sum of
#29,780. The figure was made up of half his pension entitlement of
#58,000 and half the value of the family car.
The sheriff ordered immediate payment of #2780 and then had to decide
on how Mr McEwan should meet the balance.
She rejected his argument that a payment of #40,000 (taking interest
into account) should be deferred until the year 2001 when he would be
due his pension on retiring after 30 years' service.
Sheriff Patrick ruled instead that Mr McEwan pay the #27,000 at #500 a
month, with interest on the balance outstanding from month to month at
8% until final payment.
If any single instalment remained unpaid for 14 days the whole
outstanding balance became payable immediately. She gave him a year to
pay the first instalment.
Mr McEwan lost an appeal to the Sheriff Principal and took the case to
three judges in the Court of Session.
Lord Penrose, sitting with Lords Sutherland and Brand, said yesterday
the sole issue was whether Sheriff Patrick had been entitled to order
payment of the #27,000 in the way she had.
The court was told that, at the time of the divorce, Mr McEwan had two
houses. One was in Methil, which he had been unable to sell and which he
now let out.
The other was a house in Leven where he now lived with another woman
and over which there was a #75,000 mortgage.
The court was told that Mr McEwan could not afford to pay the #500 a
month because he had neither capital nor free income to meet a sum of
that amount.
However, Sheriff Patrick considered that there should be capital
available from the sale of one of the houses and from his salary, from
which he could pay the instalements.
Lord Penrose said that while postponing a payment until the pension
became available was an approach that had been adopted in other cases,
it was not one which the sheriff was bound to follow.
The court had a discretion and the sheriff was entitled to reject it
in favour of another competent method. There was nothing to prevent her
opting for payment by instalments to secure for Mrs McEwan the benefits
to which she was entitled.
''The sheriff was clearly entitled to form the view that the move to
Leven had been made in disregard to Mr McEwan's obligations to Mrs
McEwan and that, having another less costly home, there was no reason
why he should not return to it and relieve himself of the burdens
related to the larger house.''
There had also been grounds in the evidence for the sheriff's view
that by taking steps which were within his control, Mr McEwan could
reduce his outlays and free a sum from which instalments of #500 a month
could be made.
Under the instalment scheme, Mrs McEwan, who also lives in Leven,
would be paid the principal sum in four and a half years -- by about
December 1999.
Lord Penrose said there was evidence in the case to justify the
decision taken by the sheriff and there was no basis for criticism of
her judgment.
The court refused Mr McEwan's appeal.

THE Government is expected to target the plight of the elderly having
to go into residential care, by changing pension laws at the next Budget
and encouraging people to take out private insurance to meet the cost.
A Cabinet meeting next month is likely to urge Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke to raise the #8000 threshold above which pensioners must pay the
full cost of residential care in retirement.
The meeting on September 14 could also consider proposals to allow
pensioners to have cash accumulated in occupational pension schemes set
aside for long-term health care.
The #8000 rule has meant many have to sell off their homes to pay for
care, leaving them with little or nothing to pass on to their children.
A decision on changing current tax rules may depend on whether the
scheme would release sufficient funds to take the strain off the
taxpayer without considerably reducing the amount of income a pensioner
would draw while healthy.
The scheme would work by allowing pensioners or those approaching
retirement to set aside some of their tax-free pension fund money for
future health care.
The result would be a reduced pension but a bigger pay-out if someone
had to go into a residential or nursing home.
Those who favour the scheme say the regular pension would be only
slightly less and the Treasury would lose only the tax revenue from the
reduced pension.
The Department of Health says one in six pensioners is likely to need
care for an average of three years. Nursing home fees can be as much as
#400 a week.
There are more than four million in Britain aged over 75. The number
is expected to rise to 5.5 million by 2021, with the bill for their care
likely to be around #17bn.
Mr David Shaw, vice-chairman of the Tory back-bench finance committee,
said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ''The Prime Minister has been
very concerned that people should be able to not only save for
retirement but to save for the risks that they face in retirement.''
Labour spokesman Frank Dobson said the idea looked like ''waffle''
which the Tories were putting forward to try to persuade people they
were doing something. He thought it was likely to be no more effective
then the Prime Minister's promise to end house repossessions in 1992.

Education Correspondent Barclay McBain examines the effects of the
Government's plans for funding further-education colleges.
Government speak with forked tongue.
JACK DALE, the Educational Institute of Scotland's further and higher
education secretary, is not the first person (nor will he be the last)
to make such an observation about our political masters. He believes the
Government is acting duplicitously in its plans for funding the 43
further-education colleges which have been taken out of local government
control and now receive their public money direct from the Scottish
Office.
''It is saying on the one hand that the sector must be built up, yet
on the other it says the major players must make do with less money. For
all its support for vocational training, its policies mean that FE will
have to provide for the same number of students with less funding. That
is something we are opposed to,'' said Dale.
After the colleges were removed from the largely benevolent embrace of
the local authorities, the Government made it clear that the basis on
which they had been funded would be changed.
Add to that a requirement to make ''efficiency gains'' at college
level -- where the drive for greater efficiency could lead to bigger
class sizes -- and a proposed #10m cut over two years in the Scottish FE
funding pot and you can easily understand why institutions are feeling
the squeeze.
And so are their staff. Lecturers at Jewel and Esk Valley College in
Dalkeith yesterday rejected strike action in support of three colleagues
made compulsorily redundant but the prospect of further deterioration in
labour relations in FE remains real.
More colleges will reduce their staff costs -- by voluntary means if
they can -- as they seek to come to terms with big reductions in their
budgets. As Dale put it: ''We know financial difficulties will continue
and we can expect a further round of cuts next year. The possibility of
redundancies will return.''
More than two years ago the then Education Minister, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, announced that colleges would move as quickly as
possible towards formula funding. For those colleges which had benefited
from generous local authorities' funding -- which had good reasons for
augmenting the amounts they disbursed in line with their political
strategies -- it potentially meant bad news. For those which had
struggled to make ends meet while hitting Government targets there were
benefits.
In the event the Scottish Office has been more lenient in introducing
formula funding. Last year, 90% of college money was based on historic
funding, with the remainder determined by the formula. This year the
proportions are 60-40 and there is an expectation that, from next April,
all public funding will be formula-driven.
The Government announcement on proportions and timing is eagerly
awaited, both by institutions which have been historically underfunded
and by those which will receive less and will be anxious to plan ahead.
Under the new system, funding will be based on the number of students
colleges can attract, weighted to take account of the fact that some
disciplines are more expensive than others.
Although only partially introduced, formula funding is already
exposing colleges such as Jewel and Esk, which had benefited from
Lothian region's generous funding. Dale said: ''By moving to a system
under which colleges will be funded on the same basis, those which were
funded more generously in the past will lose out, unless there is lots
more money coming in.'' Patently, that will not happen, as the public
expenditure survey proposed cut of #10m confirms.
Dale went on: ''When colleges were managed as broad units by local
authorities, students could be directed between centres, but now every
college has to fight for students, even if that means taking them from
elsewhere.''
However Alistair Tyre, principal of Langside College in Glasgow,
believes that the future is not necessarily gloomy for those
institutions which have experienced the withdrawal of local authority
''augmentive'' funding.
''There will be difficult decisions facing colleges and their boards
of management but, given sufficient planning, they should be able to
dilute the impact of this on their communities and staff.'' Such
colleges could be helped by a decision to move to full formula funding
over a longer time-scale, or by the option of safety-net funding to ease
the transition to the new model.
Mr Tyre believes that the move to formula funding will lead to a much
closer focus on the activities of individual institutions. ''In the past
they were aggregated under the banner of regional authorities, and
things could be balanced out over time. Now decisions can be taken,
whether they are pleasant or unpleasant, in-house, hopefully with the
best interests of communities and students in mind. We have to live in
the real world. We are not exempt as a microcosm of society from the
winds of change.''

<HEADLINE>Patience prevails in Indian talks with kidnappers</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976634095</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
INDIAN authorities held a fresh round of talks today with militants
holding four Westerners hostage in Kashmir amid hopes the tourists, in
their ninth week of captivity, would be released unharmed.
Officials spoke by radio with Al-Faran militants who kidnapped the
Westerners in isolated Kashmir in early July.
The latest communication came one day after American Donald Hutchings
spoke directly to Indian officials, telling them by radio that he was in
good health, as were German Dirk Hasert and Britons Keith Mangan and
Paul Wells.
That was the first direct contact between the Government and the
hostages since the men were abducted and fanned hopes Al-Faran would
eventually agree to free the tourists.
''This is another positive development,'' a senior official of the
state government said. ''We are happy that despite all the deadlines and
threats against them, we were able to talk to a hostage and prolong the
negotiations.''
The Government contacted the abductors again today, a spokesman said.
''We are talking,'' he said. ''We hope that things move quickly, but it
is a long, drawn-out process and one has to show patience.''
A fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was found beheaded
on August 13.
Near his body was a note in which Al-Faran threatened to kill the
others unless the Government released 15 jailed separatists within two
days.
That deadline, like two earlier ones, passed with no apparent harm
being done to the hostages as negotiators stepped up efforts to reach a
peaceful end to the ordeal.
The Government had requested proof that the four men were unharmed in
spite of death threats. A tape recording and photographs released last
week indicated the men were in good health, but they dated from August
18, two days before yet another death threat.
In yesterday's radio conversation, Hutchings told authorities he and
the other hostages were in good health.
Officials seeking proof the others were alive and well asked Hutchings
personal questions about them which only they could answer. They would
not say if they expected the responses in writing, on a tape recording,
or over radio.
Despite the upbeat mood in Srinagar, authorities said they did not
necessarily expect an early resolution to the crisis. ''These things
take time,'' one official said. ''We have to have a lot of patience and
prolong the negotiations.''
India has rejected a swop for the hostages, saying it would only
encourage more abductions in Kashmir, where more than 20,000 people have
reportedly died in a five-year separatist revolt.
But it has said a possible agreement could involve the release of the
hostages and jailed separatists who might have been freed under a
regular review of their prison status.--Reuter

Francesca Fearon taps into the Internet and opens up another world of
fashion advice
I AM sitting at my computer and I want advice. I want to find the
perfect mascara. I want to know where I can get Antoni &amp; Alison's
designer T-shirts. I want to check out Jean-Paul Gaultier's new
cyber-fashion collection, if it's on-line? I want a combat jacket with
neon colour flashes, but who sells it?
Sitting here at my computer I am on-line with other ''netties'' around
the world asking their advice on my fashion and beauty problems. There
are beauty-product junkies and fashion fans all furiously trading
personal tips with me on the Internet. We are now entering the era of
cyberpunks and ''surfing'' (computer speak for browsing) the
international digital superhighway.
The Internet is fast becoming the forum for the fashion conscious,
probing the information network, known as World Wide Web for information
on their favourite subject. The worldwide population on the Net is
estimated to be 30 million and growing fast.
Surfing the digital superhighway was predominantly the past-time of
young middleclass men, however, times are changing in cyberspace.
It is now estimated that between 25% and 30% of surfers are women.
Their informal Scottish headquarters is Cyberia Cafe in Edinburgh -- a
branch will be opening in Glasgow next month. It is an Internet coffee
shop where ''netties'' can sit with their cappuccinos hunched over
screens with their fingertips racing across the keyboards, chatting to
friends on E.mail or browsing through style catalogues already on-line.
At Cyberia there are cyber-hostesses on hand to help the Technophobes
and Internet virgins to learn to surf. ''Net surfing is not a solitary
pursuit, it is fun and sociable,'' says Gavin Nicholson, who runs
Cyberia here. ''We want to offer access to the Net for everyone to show
that it is relaxed and not intimidating.''
Where technology forges ahead fashion snaps at its heels. It stands to
reason that as more people surf, fashion and beauty names are fast
developing a presence on-line. A number of style and shopping services
are available including Pepe jeans, Future Shooter, and Avant Garde
designer menswear label Griffin Laundry, which has also used the Net as
a fashion statement for their autumn collection, hi-tech urban
sportswear themed around cyberpunks.
Designer Lisa Johnson plans to use the medium to promote her spring
1996 collection and T-shirt designers Antoni &amp; Alison are strongly
tempted. Model agencies are using it as a means of downloading their
data base of photographs to clients. While journalism students at the
London College of Fashion have launched a cyberzine -- an on-line style
magazine called N-Touch.
Shiseido, the supreme Japanese cosmetic firm has launched itself on
the Net in Japan with a virtual reality shopping mall of its products.
Clinique in the US has claimed its small corner of cyberspace with
20,000 CyberFace interactive beauty disks, for those unable to gain
access to these, Clinique has an on-line counter in the US. But
difficulties of using the Net for mail order (protecting charge card
numbers) have only just been resolved.
By late autumn, Benetton will be using the Net both as a data base of
their fashion collections and provider of archival information, and as a
democratic forum for political debate on social issues -- in the same
way they use their advertising for visual communication.
Next month Diesel, the Avant Garde jeans brand will be promoting its
collection on the network.
Fashion has not only invaded Internet it has used the digital
superhighway as a source of inspiration. Gaultier and Hussein Chalayan
and Owen Gaster were all inspired by futuristic computer graphics and
virtual reality images for their autumn collections. Shiny, hi-tech
fabrics, metallics, lots of zips and slick, skin-fit, modern silhouettes
spell out the dawning of cyber-fashion.

FOOTBALLER Ray Kennedy, forced to sell his medals and caps after being
struck down by Parkinson's disease, yesterday welcomed the news that a
millionaire benefactor had left some of the mementoes to his son.
The 44-year-old former Arsenal, Liverpool, and England star, auctioned
the medals and international caps in 1993 but now the purchaser of his
17 England caps has left eight of them in his will to the footballer's
14-year-old son, Dale.
''It is really fantastic, a very nice gesture,'' Mr Kennedy said from
his specially adapted bungalow in Tyne and Wear yesterday. ''It was
heart-breaking to have to lose all the mementoes of my career, but with
my health being as it is, I had to ensure my financial stability. I
didn't even know who had bought the caps, but he must have been a really
nice guy.''
The caps were left in the will of Mr Lawrence Levy, of Hampstead,
north London. He specified that they should go to Dale ''in the hope
that they will not be sold''.
Mr Kennedy said: ''They will definitely not be sold. Dale was so
pleased to be given the caps. He plays for a local boys' football side
and he's not a bad player. Perhaps the caps will inspire him.''
The sale of footballing honours raised #88,407 at Christie's in
Glasgow. The eight caps cost Mr Levy #6820.

BEHIND the carved Portland stone and mock-Tudor beams of Liberty's
Regent Street headquarters some big changes are taking place, notably
the launch of its own major fashion collection.
The fashion floor, once renowned for its floral Tana Lawn prints and
Kate Greenaway dresses, has swept away that
haven-to-middle-England-dressmakers image and replaced it with an array
of beautifully made aesthetic clothing from designers like Yohji
Yamamoto and Issey Miyake.
The philosophy, beside the Oriental element, has been to seek out the
very best of British design -- modernists, like Galliano, Conran, Flyte
Ostell, and Betty Jackson who possess an extraordinary understanding of
the technique of crafting clothes.
Having established the foundations of Liberty's fashion image, the
Liberty empire has taken the big step of launching its own-label fashion
collection, which will be available from branches in Glasgow and
Edinburgh next month.
The Liberty Collection is modern and colourful yet reflects something
of Liberty's extraordinary heritage. A short scarlet wool crepe coat and
dress, a funky bright tweed suit, a 1940s pinstripe box jacket and wide
trousers are the fashion looks of the moment. Yet mixed in with this are
the idiosyncratic Liberty print satin shirts and camisoles.
The firefly is one of the patterns which Dilys Williams, the head of
design, found in the archives. She recoloured it and printed it on
georgette and the shiny silks and satins currently in vogue.
''Liberty is so well known for its beautiful use of fabrics, that we
went first to the cloth, worked on the colours and recut the patterns,''
she explains. ''Some of the original patterns are really wild.''
Fashion's current passion for merging modernity with nostalgia can be
echoed now in the Liberty Collection by drawing on the decades of
Liberty prints stored in the archives.
After seasons of safe neutral colours, bright crimsons, yellows and
pinks are making a comeback. Reflecting this new colour palette is the
return of bold, vivid prints.
A generation of painters, designers and architects enthused about
Liberty. The pre-Raphaelites and their beautiful models, the Arts and
Crafts movement and writers like Marcel Proust crowded the little
Liberty store when it first opened in the late nineteenth century. They
bought scarves, ties, fabrics and artefacts from the Orient. From the
outset the Liberty name has been associated with the best in
contemporary decorative arts and design. The fashion director, Tom
Logan, Dilys Williams and the design team want to built up that House of
Liberty name again.
Dilys Williams, previously designer for Jigsaw and Whistles, has been
charged with this task. ''We started from scratch, building a design
studio with a full team of pattern cutters and production people. We
felt there is such a strength in the heritage and we wanted to be part
of it.''
The collection they have created includes the essential classic pieces
that now have a distinctly modern touch, such as the chic stretch boucle
Audrey Hepburn-style coat and dress and the pastel mohair check
tailoring. The emphasis is placed on originality of design and strong
colour combinations.
* EXCLUSIVE to Herald readers, Liberty is organising a special
customer evening at their shop in Glasgow, where Dilys Williams will
introduce the collection. It will be held on September 27 at Liberty,
Buchanan Street, Glasgow. For free tickets, contact Rozanne McElhone on
0141-221 7792. The Liberty collection will be available also at their
branch in Princes Street, Edinburgh.

FORMER Heritage Secretary David Mellor and Viscountess Cobham -- whose
romance became public last November -- look set to marry following her
''quickie'' divorce yesterday.
Mrs Judith Mellor divorced her husband -- the MP for Putney in
south-west London -- in March and this summer he set up home with Lady
Cobham in a #1m mansion near London's Tower Bridge.
The decree nisi ending the Cobhams' marriage was one of 30 granted
yesterday morning at the divorce registry in Somerset House, London. It
becomes absolute in six weeks.
Viscount Cobham said in a statement from his stately home, Hagley
Hall, Worcestershire, that he believed Lady Cobham and Mr Mellor planned
to marry.
The split between Mr Mellor, 46, and his wife came as little surprise,
although she previously stuck by him when news broke about his
well-publicised affair with actress Antonia de Sancha.
The scandal forced him to resign as National Heritage Secretary but he
quickly established another career as host of a BBC Radio 5 Live soccer
phone-in.
This summer, Lady Cobham, 41, and Mr Mellor declared they were ''an
item'' and set up home together.
Viscount Cobham, 52, married the former Penelope Cooper in 1974. She
is president of the Heart of England Tourist Board and has worked as a
special adviser in the Heritage Department.
Mr Mellor was not available for comment.

Petrol bombs were thrown in Crossmaglen on the South Armagh border
last night as Sinn Fein mounted a series of pickets and rallies to mark
this week's first anniversary of the IRA ceasefire.
The petrol bombs, said police, were thrown at the Crossmaglen security
base during the rally outside.
At one stage during the protest a van load of men drove up and started
to saw down some of the perimeter security fencing. The security forces
did not intervene and the men left. A number of tyres were piled up
against the side of the base and set on fire.

MILLIONS of holidaymakers will be paying more for their trips to Spain
and its islands next summer, it was revealed yesterday.
Tour-operating giant First Choice announced average Spanish price
rises of 9% as it launched its 1996 summer brochures. The UK's two
biggest holiday companies, Thomson and Airtours, were also expected to
announce costlier Costa packages when they reveal their plans for next
summer today.
The hike in Spanish prices was likely to add around #90 to the cost of
a package for a family of four, assuming one of the children goes free
as part of one of the many special deals on offer.
To add to holidaymakers' problems, there could be fewer packages to
choose from next summer.
First Choice said yesterday that it was offering 15% fewer holidays
next summer than it had originally intended when it first planned the
1996 brochures.
Airtours was also expected to offer fewer holidays next summer while a
Thomson spokeswoman said last night: ''We have had a long, hard look at
the market this year and made our plans for 1996 accordingly.''
A spokesman for Airtours said Spanish prices had risen because
hoteliers had put their prices up above the level of local inflation
after having had a particularly good summer.
Spain was popular not only with Britons but also with the Dutch and
the Germans, who on average have more spending power.
In addition, the Government plans to alter the conditions governing
VAT rates on part of the profits tour operators make, and companies have
anticipated this by increasing some prices for next summer.
First Choice attempted to counter the Spanish rises by extending its
''no-pocket-money-needed'' packages, including holidays to 16
destinations in Europe as well as the Caribbean in 1996. They start at
#299 for a week in Turkey.
''There is still a lack of consumer confidence and the fine weather in
the UK persuaded a lot of people to holiday at home this summer,'' said
First Choice commercial director Peter Phillipson.
''We are being more conservative about the number of holidays we are
offering next summer but we are hoping that many thousands will enjoy
the novelty of all-inclusive breaks.''
New long-haul destinations being offered by the company next summer
include Tobago, Antigua, Grenada, and Sri Lanka.
Prices start at #149 for a week in a self-catering apartment on
Spain's Costa Brava.
New from Thomson next year will be packages to the south of France,
including the top resorts of Nice and Cannes. Prices will start at #149
for a week's self-catering.
Thomson will also be announcing Florida children's prices of #99.

THE Scottish Friends of Bosnia yesterday urged the United Nations to
take military and political action against the Bosnian Serbs after the
massacre of 37 people in Sarajevo on Monday.
Mr Mladen Grbin, secretary of the organisation, said the international
community had clearly identified the aggressor in the conflict and
should therefore act.
He said the UN should stop the Bosnian Serbs from broadcasting
propaganda and should also target military installations and
logistically important roads and bridges.
He said the international community should also stop negotiating with
the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic.
He suggested the Sarajevo killings this week should not be seen in
isolation.
''No-one has actually been referring to the fact that this is a
besieged city for three-and-a-half years. This was just one shell in a
war of attrition,'' added Mr Grbin.
He claimed the international community, in particular Britain and
France, were ''bending backwards'' to explain why they could not react
immediately as promised at the Lancaster House conference.
He continued: ''The American administration wants a quick fix before
next year's primaries. Europe is in disarray over the issue, its envoys
shuttling between European capitals with an unclear agenda.'' He claimed
this arose from ''cynicism of the ultimate form.''
* Cardinal Thomas Winning will formally open an all-faith 12-hour
vigil of prayer for the people of Bosnia today in the City Chambers,
Glasgow. The event, which begins at noon, has been organised by the
recently formed Save the Bosnian People Campaign.

THE SCOTTISH Secretary, Mr Michael Forsyth, was urged yesterday to
call a special meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee in Edinburgh to
debate the increasing confusion over rail privatisation.
However, the Scottish Office said last night Mr Forsyth did not have
the power to do so.
Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy has written to Mr Forsyth against
the backdrop of recent reports involving the shelving of the West Coast
franchise and internal industry predictions that the ScotRail franchise
cannot be achieved before the next General Election.
Mr Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye, said yesterday: ''Under
the Taking Stock reforms, the Scottish Grand Committee now enjoys
greater autonomy and flexibility. It should be able to convene during
the summer recess for specifically Scottish reasons, quite independent
of the situation at Westminster.
''The new Scottish Secretary owes it to all ScotRail employees,
Scottish MPs, and the public generally to come clean over the developing
fiasco of rail privatisation.''

GLASGOW'S planning chairman found himself in the awkward position of
having to give planning permission for a building he thinks will be the
ugliest thing he has ever seen.
''It's too late now to change things,'' said Councillor Hugh Macrae as
he cast a critical eye over a model of a proposed new #24m conference
centre which is to be added to the existing Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre complex.
However, the chairman differed with his officials, all of whom seemed
to think the striking design by Sir Norman Foster and Partners showed
flair and imagination.
In the view of one official, any incongruity would be due to the
medocrity of the buildings around it.
The controversial structure, comprising eight curved aluminium-clad
bands, reminiscent of Sydney Opera House, will have a capacity for more
than 3000 delegates and is expected to provide Glasgow with a conference
facility to rival anything in Europe.
However, Councillor Macrae remained unconvinced.
He complained: ''It's the ugliest thing I've ever seen. It looks like
an armadillo in the course of burying itself in the ground. It's
unbelievable. I'm far from pleased by this building.
''However, I'm sure it will be a talking point.''
The application submitted by the SECC was approved by bemused members
of the planning committee, many of whom were concerned about impact of
such a spectacular structure on the city's skyline and what effect
weathering would have on the aluminium cladding.
No doubt Glaswegians will settle on an unofficial name for the
structure. Suggestions so far so far include the Armadillo Building, the
Isaac Azimov Centre, and, more crudely, the Silver Slug.

ROUND-the-world yachtswoman Lisa Clayton yesterday spoke of her relief
and delight at having her record-breaking voyage ratified officially.
Since sailing into Dartmouth, Devon, on June 29 after a gruelling 286
days at sea, Ms Clayton has been forced to battle doubters who claimed
she had lied about her achievement.
Anonymous telephone calls and a lengthy letter to the World Sailing
and Speed Records Council accused her of receiving help when her yacht,
The Spirit of Birmingham, was damaged at sea.
However, she proved her case with the help of a dossier of thousands
of written logs and fax messages she had sent from the yacht.
Yesterday, the WSSRC confirmed her as the first woman from the
northern hemisphere to sail single-handed, unaided, and non-stop around
the world.
A delighted Ms Clayton said: ''It is nice for everyone and a relief,
although we were confident all the way along that we would get it
ratified.''

<HEADLINE>Orkney family on epic trip are thrown out of China</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ROVING Orkney family who paid out thousands of pounds to escape a
courtroom wrangle in Mongolia have now been thrown out of neighbouring
China.
Mr David Grant and his three children thought their epic voyage was
back on track when they made their way to Beijing on their horse-drawn
caravan.
However, they were apprehended by Chinese police who deported them,
claiming they did not have suitable visas.
Already short on funds, they were forced to pay #3000 for passage on a
ship to Japan and then #4500 on quarantine fees for their horse and
dogs.
They are now staying at Osaka, a port south of Tokyo, and could even
face problems leaving there.
Mr Grant, 54, and his wife Kate, 44, sold their home in Orkney in 1990
to pay for the globe-trotting journey. They planned to take their three
young children across Europe, Russia, China, over to Canada, and back to
Scotland.
The Grants were four years into their trip of a lifetime when their
dream turned sour in Mongolia in April.
Mr Grant was accused of blinding a thief who tried to raid their
caravan and was forced to stay in the country's capital, Ulaanbataar.
While he and children Torcuil, 15, Eilidh, 13, and Fionn, 10, stayed
on with their horse and dogs, Mrs Grant flew back to Britain to campaign
for his release.
After months of legal wrangling, their despair ended in July when an
out-of-court settlement with Mr Grant's accuser won his freedom.
They moved on to China -- but their celebrations were short-lived.
Mrs Grant, who has been staying at her father's home in Botley, near
Southampton, will be flying out to rejoin her family on Friday.
They then plan to move on to Canada for the penultimate leg of the
journey but the move is already proving problematic.
Mrs Grant said yesterday: ''It has cost us nearly #10,000 in one week
just to get to Japan. We still don't know if we will get into Canada
because of the quarantine laws.
''Apparently, you have to be in the country of departure for 60 days
before you are allowed into Canada and our animals won't have been in
Japan for that long.
''It's sad about China. We were looking forward to being there. It was
going to be one of the highlights of the expedition. But I can't wait
until we're together again after all this hassle.''
Since their adventure began, the family has travelled through Holland,
Belgium, France, Italy, Austria, Hungary, the Ukraine, and Russia.
They expect to arrive home in 1997 after travelling across Canada and
Scotland, and Mr Grant plans to write books about the trip.

A POLITICAL campaign to highlight a link between the erosion of public
services and an increase in private sleaze was launched in Scotland
yesterday by the country's largest trade union.
The Unison campaign, which will cost #250,000 and will take place
throughout the autumn, will target the effect of 16 years of
Conservative Government which it claims has undermined public services
while business leaders have been awarded increasingly fat salaries.
It will highlight the likely effects of privatisation of British Rail
and the nuclear industry, the reorganisation of water and sewerage
services and local government as well as changes to the control of
Scottish schools.
Mr Mike Kirby, Scottish convener of Unison said: ''The idea is to
unite public service trade unions, voluntary organisations, elected
representatives, user and community groups, and the unemployed in
opposition to the greed and sleaze fostered by the last 16 years of Tory
Government.''
Mr Matt Smith, Unison's Scottish secretary, said: ''By early
September, we will have contacted 2000 Scottish organisations and have
already planned involvement with 10 of them.''
The union yesterday admitted that the campaign, which culminates in a
national demonstration in London on October 21, is politically motivated
and is geared to coincide with the next Budget and the Government's
attempt to relaunch its public image.
Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, associate general secretary of Unison, said:
''It is vital to the future of Scotland's public services that the
campaign is a success.
''The Scottish attitude to public services is one of support, the
current Tory Government's attitude is one of sell-off and close down.''
Mr Bickerstaffe claimed the Government's next budget would ''give
away'' between #2500m and #4000m to ''buy votes'' in various forms of
tax cuts and incentives and this would be paid for at the expense of
public services.
''Therefore this is an important political campaign -- not just an
industrial one -- to mobilise support as the Government attempts to
repackage itself to the public before the next General Election,'' he
said.

MARSEILLES: Huge forest fires have destroyed hundreds of acres of
woodland in the south of France, northern Portugal, and Spain, and have
cost several lives.
Some 400 firemen and 12 water-dropping planes fought flames near the
town of Lambesc, north of the French Mediterranean port of Marseilles
yesterday, but were hampered by gusts of wind.
Another fire south of Bordeaux devastated 375 acres of pine forest
before it was finally brought under control.
Firefighters were also battling a five-mile wall of flames in Serra do
Marao, northern Portugal. Two villages were threatened and houses were
in danger near Fafe. Six people have died in Portuguese fires this month
and two firemen died in Marseilles on Monday.
In Spain, Greenpeace said about 40% of the fires that ravaged forests
each summer were caused by arson and resulted in big profits for the
timber business.--Reuter/AP.

THE Prime Minister entertained the just-retired Ulster Unionist leader
Mr James Molyneaux to lunch at Chequers yesterday and sought an update
on Unionist thinking on what happens next on the peace process in
Northern Ireland.
Mr Major, who invited Mr Molyneaux within hours of hearing of his
resignation, thanked him for his contribution to the process.
Two points especially worry Ministers. First, will Mr Molyneaux's
successor be as co-operative as he has been about the peace process or
will he be inclined to voice more loudly Unionist fears that Britain is
being steadily driven in the direction of a united Ireland?
Second, will he and his colleagues be as willing in the next session
of Parliament this autumn to come to the rescue of the Government if it
faces rebellions in its own ranks.
As the Government's Commons majority declines into single figures,
this back-stop support becomes more crucial and a different Unionist
leader may demand more for his support.
British sources still were hoping that the planned summit between Mr
Major and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton would go ahead next Wednesday
but admit that, if British and Irish officials cannot agree on proposals
on decommissioning arms for discussion by the two leaders, the meeting
may have to be postponed.
The Ulster Unionist Party is rushing through the vote for the new
leader. It will be held in 10 days to ensure that the new leader is in
place as soon as possible at a crucial phase in the peace process.
Four men, all MPs, are expected to run for the leadership. They are Mr
Ken Maginnis, the party security spokesman, Mr William Ross, the Chief
Whip, the Rev Martin Smyth, Grandmaster of the Orange Order, and Mr John
Taylor.
All but Mr Taylor have declared their interests in running.
Mr Taylor, the MP for Strangford, is generally seen as the
Government's preferred successor. Despite his strong criticism of the
framework document, he is regarded as the man most likely to take the
Unionists into historic all-party talks with Sinn Fein.
Mr Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, has taken a tough line
on the IRA and repeatedly predicted the collapse of the ceasefire, which
is one year old on Friday.
He is nevertheless seen as being on the more moderate wing of the
party and has also made trips into the republic, most recently for his
summer holiday.
Mr Ross, the MP for East Londonderry, is reportedly Mr Molyneaux's
favoured successor and seen by party colleagues as a safe pair of hands.
There is unlikely to be any change in emphasis with him at the helm.
Mr Smyth, the South Belfast MP, can expect strong support from the
more than 100 delegates from the Orange Order who have voting rights at
the election.
A poll published in a Dublin Sunday newspaper showed that of Ulster
Unionist voters questioned, 41% favoured Mr Maginnis as leader, with 13%
opting for Mr Taylor. Mr Smyth got 14% and Mr Ross just 3%.
However, David Trimble, the Upper Bann MP who has declared he will not
run for the leadership, received 18% of support and it is believed that
in his absence much of that would transfer to Mr Taylor.
The Prime Minister is certain to have used the private farewell
luncheon for Mr Molyneaux to discover his views on who his successor is
likely to be.
The meal was atteded by Norma Major and Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew.
Mr Major is understood to have decided on the lunch following Mr
Molyneaux's retirement announcement on Monday, the day after his 75th
birthday, to thank him for his steadying influence and contribution to
the search for peace in Ulster.
Although Mr Molyneaux will remain as MP for Lagan Valley until the
next General Election, he is not expected to stand again and it is
thought likely that the long-serving Privy Councillor will be offered a
seat in the House of Lords.

BALD men are burdened with feelings of depression, low self-esteem,
and the fear of being unattractive, it was claimed yesterday.
Young men who go bald prematurely suffer the most, according to a team
of psychologists studying the effects of hair loss.
A survey of more than 180 men with an average age of 36 revealed that
increasing degrees of hair loss were accompanied by loss of self-esteem.
Bald or balding men felt unattractive, depressed, socially withdrawn,
and tended to be introverted or neurotic, the study found.
Dr Pamela Wells, who led the research at Goldsmith's College, south
London, said it was time people stopped regarding baldness as a joke.
''It's appalling the way people think it is hilarious when people go
bald and try to get a hair transplant or hairpiece.
''It would be absolutely unthinkable to treat women who are worried
about their appearance the way we treat bald men.''
The men involved in the study did not know the research was about
baldness.
Divided into three groups, the bald, the balding, and those with a
full head of hair, they were asked questions about their smoking habits
and level of self-confidence.
''The results were pretty profound in the younger people,'' said Dr
Wells. ''You don't expect to find such significant effects when you do
this kind of analysis.''
She said one of the researchers knew a student who became suicidal
after going bald in his 20s.
The researchers believe the negative way bald men regard themselves is
not a true reflection of how others see them.

A 14-STRONG convoy which left Scotland earlier this month for Bosnia
and which includes Scots Labour MP John Home Robertson has had its aid
efforts put on hold in the wake of the Sarajevo market blast.
With the possibility of retaliatory air strikes against the Bosnian
Serbs for the attack in which 37 died, Edinburgh Direct Aid has had to
shelve plans to move supplies into the city.
However, Dr Denis Rutovitz, the director of Edinburgh Direct Aid, who
is with the convoy held up in Split, has pledged that the mercy mission
will get through eventually.
''I have been to Sarajevo often enough now to have made many
friends,'' Dr Rutovitz told The Herald yesterday in a telephone call
from the former Yugoslavia.
''I just find it very upsetting,'' he stated. ''It is very personal
and you worry about the people. It's so terrible for those who are
there.''
Dr Rutovitz said that before Monday's blast in Sarajevo he would have
been ''100% confident'' of reaching the city as planned but the
situation had changed dramatically.
''If there was to be Nato air strikes the Serbs might respond by
bombarding everything in sight.''
Edinburgh Direct Aid set out on their 25th relief mission on August 17
with lorry loads of food, clothing and toiletries for Sarajevo and
Tuzla.
The party travelled despite the dangers highlighted earlier by the
recent deaths of two British aid workers near Sarajevo, one of whom was
34-year-old Mr Neil Golightly, from Broomhill, Glasgow.
They were killed on the Mount Igman road to Sarajevo -- the route
Edinburgh Direct Aid would take -- when their truck, part of a convoy
run by the Surrey-based charity Phoenix Aid International Direct, of
which the Scot was a co-founder, crashed after coming under fire.
* The last British troops to pull out of the UN ''safe haven'' of
Gorazde will arrive home tomorrow, the Army said yesterday.
Nearly 80 Royal Welch Fusiliers will fly into RAF Brize Norton,
Oxfordshire, including Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Riley who commanded
the battalion during its hazardous six-month tour of duty in Bosnia.
The final contingent to withdraw from Gorazde was given safe passage
by road through Serb territory to Belgrade from where it is expected to
travel on to the UN base at Split before flying home.

<HEADLINE>Region holds the line over rail timetable.   Regulator's boost for Strathclyde.</HEADLINE>

STRATHCLYDE'S uncompromising stance in laying down the law on the
level of rail services within the region is behind ScotRail's
embarrassing slippage in the Government's increasingly chaotic
privatisation timetable.
Perhaps even more crucially, however, the independent Rail Regulator
has now pledged to promote Strathclyde's interests so far as possible,
according to a document in the possession of The Herald.
Regulator John Swift, QC, is determined to ensure that any commercial
aspirations are not only matched with the public interest but with those
such as Strathclyde who actually pay for the rail services.
Mr Swift is also adamant that the privatisation process must take
place in a manner that ensures the industry is not left to ''pick up the
pieces'' from a programme carried out too hastily or without regard to
the interests of users.
Such views -- expressed at a meeting with key players in the sell-off
process -- go a long way towards explaining why next month's invitation
to ScotRail to bid for the train operating franchise has been postponed,
railway experts said last night.
They also underpin growing suspicions that ScotRail, along with
InterCity West Coast main line, will not be in private hands before a
General Election.
Mr Swift's declaration that Strathclyde's interests should be promoted
in any agreement concerning track access is a massive boost for the
council.
Strathclyde is battling to retain rights to control fares, timetables,
and the standards of trains, in return for paying ScotRail #30m a year
to run the largest commuter network outside London.
The Herald has a full transcript of the Rail Regulator's meeting,
attended by, among others, the directors of ScotRail and Railtrack and
officials from the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising -- and the
Department of Transport and British Railways Board.
Mr Swift was called in earlier this month to adjudicate on a proposed
track access agreement between ScotRail and Railtrack which would have
serious implications for Strathclyde passenger services.
In June, Lord Cameron had refused to grant the region and Strathclyde
Passenger Transport Executive an interim interdict in the Court of
Session, aimed at enforcing an existing agreement with British Rail, due
to expire on September 30.
However, Mr Swift believes that both the council and PTE will have ''a
critical role'' in the formulation of policy and decision making within
the Strathclyde network.
Lines are now under the control of Railtrack and, to run trains, BR
has to agree access, with the contract to be approved by Mr Swift.
The transcript reveals that:
* Strathclyde, although willing to talk, will ''not compromise'' its
principles, especially the council taxpayers' right to determine the
level of services for which they pay;
* The PTE considers the proposed access contract is ''too loose'' --
neither guaranteeing that ScotRail would continue to deliver existing
services, nor that a future franchisee would meet obligations, and that;
* Doubts exist about the reasonableness of Railtrack's charges, even
if it is willing to open the books for inspection and to itemise
individual costs.
Strathclyde's transport committee chairman, Councillor Charles Gordon,
said the region had spent #400m at today's prices on expanding rail
services and he deplored ''the hiatus'' being imposed on the network
because of privatisation.
Councillor Gordon also told Mr Swift of concerns that Railtrack was
not investing in infrastructure, despite council offers to enhance and
develop the network.
However, ScotRail and Railtrack officials appeared content with the
terms of the proposed contract, although niggling matters of flexibility
and reliability remain.
Strathclyde's contribution to ScotRail now stands at #110m, because of
Railtrack's soaring access charges after the Government raised the real
cost of railway assets to get a better return from a sale.
The Government has guaranteed to make up the difference but only for
the moment. Strathclyde fears that funding could dry up next year.

GENERAL Rupert Smith, the British UN Commander in Bosnia, yesterday
prepared the plans to punish the Bosnian Serbs for the shelling of a
Sarajevo market which killed 37 people and wounded more than 80.
The UN said it had been confirmed Bosnian Serb forces were
responsible.
Spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Vernon said the risks of Serb
retribution for a Nato strike were low after the final contingent of
British peacekeepers left Gorazde and reached Belgrade yesterday.
In London, Mr Major was contacted by French President Jacques Chirac
and spent 15 minutes discussing the Bosnian crisis, Downing Street said.
After the UN had concluded Bosnian Serbs were responsible for the
attack, it said all options had been reviewed, including the use of Nato
air power, to punish them.
UN officials also said that if bad weather had prevented a retaliatory
air strike, British and French heavy artillery of the UN Rapid Reaction
Force, dug in on Mount Igman outside Sarajevo, could have been turned on
Serb positions.
A Nato spokesman said General Smith had assessed the action with
Admiral Leighton Smith, the commander-in-chief of the alliance's
southern flank.
''We will know their assessment after the action has been taken,'' he
said.
He added that the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt had cancelled
a port visit to Rhodes and was steaming back to the Adriatic.
The West has been reluctant to take action to punish Serb aggression
since hundreds of UN peacekeepers were taken hostage in retaliation for
previous air strikes this spring, but the withdrawal of the remaining 77
Royal Welch Fusiliers from Gorazde leaves only two UN military observers
and one political officer in the town.
The only major concentration of peacekeepers still on the Bosnian Serb
side of the confrontation lines is about 450 Russians around Sarajevo.
The Russians, traditional friends of the Serbs, are considered to be at
much less risk.
UN forces have been ordered to stay out of Bosnian Serb territory
during the current crisis, the UN confirmed.
In Sarajevo the misery continued, with a four-year old girl killed and
two of her friends wounded when another mortar bomb exploded outside
homes near the city's brewery. A 22-year-old man was also wounded in the
latest attack.
The UN threats have failed so far to appease an angry Bosnian
government, which said it would pull out of peace talks unless the Serbs
were punished.
Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic, in Paris for the talks, demanded
heavy artillery or Nato strikes against the besieging Serbs.
If there was no punishment for the shelling he said: ''Bosnian public
opinion demands that we pull out of peace talks.''
Confirmation that Serbs were responsible also brought calls for
military action from Muslim countries sympathetic to Bosnia, and both
the French and German foreign ministers.
In Paris, Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said: ''We want a
reprisal since it is clear from the analysts that the origin is Serb.''
With pressure building up for tough action, Washington ordered the
aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to Bosnia's Adriatic coast with
dozens of warplanes aboard.
Pentagon officials called it a prudent step in view of the
circumstances.
As US diplomats in Paris struggled to keep their peace drive on
course, the Bosnian Serb parliament abruptly changed course and welcomed
the American plan.
Parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik said it has ''many elements which
prompt our optimism in the final solution to the crisis and
establishment of peace''.
''We have agreed to continue negotiations, believing that the chances
for achieving peace are much better today,'' he added.
However the timing of the sudden shift inevitably raised suspicions
about Serb sincerity and whether they were simply manoeuvring in the
hope of putting off massive UN and Nato retaliation.--Reuter

CONCERN that sports facilities should be protected from development
has prompted Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to intervene in the
determination of an application for a large foodstore on football
pitches at Toryglen Park, Glasgow.
He has instructed Glasgow district's planning committee to refer the
application from Jaymarke Development Prospecthill Ltd. to the Scottish
Sports Council.
Mr Forsyth said: ''The Scottish Sports Council are best placed to
provide the necessary professional and independent advice on the local
requirements for sport. It is therefore important that their view is
sought so that the council can take the right decision based on the best
advice.''
The applicants seek outline planning consent to erect a 60,000sq ft
foodstore on part of the playing fields, create 587 parking spaces, and
provide servicing facilities.
The 9.2 acre site lies on the Aitkenhead Road/Prospecthill Road
junction.
Planning chairman, Councillor Hugh Macrae, confirmed the application
would be referred to the Scottish Sports Council.

THE Morrison Group last year was given a detailed specification to
build the new headquarters of Highland Health Board at least a fortnight
before other competitors, and subsequently went on to win the contract,
worth almost #2m, earlier this year.
The company, which is chaired by Mr Fraser Morrison, who also chairs
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, was given the information by
representatives of Highland Health Board, which is chaired by Mr John
Robertson, who is also a member of the board of HIE.
On Friday, Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch issued a statement
which insisted that Morrisons had no ''inside track'' to the contract to
build the new Inverness HQ of the North of Scotland Water Authority,
which is also chaired by Mr John Robertson.
Mr Kynoch said he had every confidence in Mr Morrison and Mr Robertson
and deplored any attempt to denigrate them.
This followed a report in The Herald last Wednesday that Morrisons had
lodged a detailed planning application three days before any local
competitors had even received the specification and that Morrisons was
the only company to be promoted by HIE in negotiations with the water
authority.
In the case of the new Highland Health Board offices, Morrisons -- who
finalised the contract on March 28 this year -- lodged a planning
application at Inverness divisional planning office on Friday, September
2, last year for approximately 23,500 sq ft on land the company owned at
Beechwood, Inverness.
This contained detail obviously contained in the health board's
specification.
An invitation to tender was sent out on August 12 but not received
until August 15. This contained information from the health board's
agents, the Edinburgh-based quantity surveyors, cost engineers, and
project managers Faithful and Gould.
This proposed a complicated formula which required developers to
survey and value seven existing health board properties in Inverness,
which the developer would then take on, receiving only the balance
between their value and the contract price.
This formula was abandoned on September 29, but most of the
competitors were still busy with its time-consuming procedure when
Morrisons lodged their detailed planning application.
When asked how they could have been so far ahead, a spokesman for the
Morrison Group explained: ''In July, we were approached by those
representing the health board, Faithful and Gould and the Neil Munro
Property Consultancy, and asked about the availability and likely cost
of a building.
''At that time, we didn't know who their client was. However, later
that same month, we had a site visit with them. At that meeting, the
project manager from Faithful &amp; Gould, Donald Lawson, gave us two
volumes of tender contracts, both dated July 1994.
''On page three of volume two, there are all the space specifications
for the building.''
Yesterday, when The Herald contacted Mr Lawson, who is a director of
Faithful &amp; Gould, to ask why only one company had been given this
information in July, he said: ''I am not prepared to discuss this matter
with you because of client confidentiality.''
A spokesman for Highland Health Board said Faithful and Gould had
operated on behalf of Highland Health Board to assist in the disposal of
existing properties and to secure the provision of a new headquarters
office where all board activities would be organised under one roof.
The firm was appointed after a competitive tendering process.
''On September 21, 1994, Faithful and Gould reported to HHB that they
had contacted eight companies on August 12 with a view to pursuing
developments that would meet the board's needs. Returns were asked for
from these companies by 12 noon on Septmber 16.
''Three offers were received by the board by that time, with a further
late submission. One of these, Morrisons, offered best value and was
accepted by the board after further negotiation in March 1995.
''In all of its activities, HHB is conscious of its responsibility
with regard to best use of public funds and has ensured that competition
for the building of the new headquarters has been conducted in
accordance with the highest standards of financial probity,'' the
spokesman said.
0 Labour trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson, who has been
highly critical of the quango system in the Highlands, said last night:
''It looks as though Mr Kynoch will have to get his whitewash brush out
again.
''The central principle is that where there are overlapping interests,
fairness should not only exist but must be seen to exist.
''The whole point of competitive tendering is surely that everyone
starts from the same point. Whatever Mr Kynoch states after cursory
examination, that hasn't happened in either of these cases.''
Mr Robertson could not be contacted for comment.

<HEADLINE>Drugs test kits now available for companies to screen employees</HEADLINE>

A SCOTTISH company is marketing test kits to employers who want to
screen their workers for drugs abuse.
Greenock based Bio-Generics offers kits which test urine for ecstasy,
speed, cannabis, or cocaine, and already have contracts with a number of
large public and private-sector organisations.
Last year, they introduced the kits for sale to parents. Now, thanks
to their expansion into the industrial sector, they are giving them free
to parents.
However, the head of one of Scotland's major medical research
companies warned employers that sloppy testing could result in expensive
lawsuits by aggrieved employees.
Dr Walter Nimmo, chief executive of Inveresk Clinical Research, said
inadvertant passive smoking of cannabis was one possible source of false
accusation they had discovered while screening volunteers for their
clinical drug-testing programmes.
Human volunteers are given a thorough medical check-up beforehand and
are screened for drugs, whether recreational or prescribed, which might
put them at risk when combined with the trial product or confound the
results.
''We regularly have to turn away people who we find have been taking
cannabis. We can't prove it but we think it is possible that some of the
positives are the result of passive cannabis smoking,'' said Dr Nimmo.
''For one thing, everyone, regardless of whether they are smokers or
not, tests positive for nicotine. Our tests don't quantify the amount
but clearly tobacco smoke is ubiquitous.
''We get people who test positive for cannabis and say they haven't
been using it and, sometimes, we are inclined to believe them. They may
have been to a party recently, they have been straight with us on
previous occasions, and they have no reason to lie since it is in
confidence and they have to be excluded from the trial anyway.''
Other problems could arise if employers who carried out testing failed
to ensure a secure chain of custody for samples and left the risk, or
suspicion, of a mix-up somewhere along the line.
''Cutting corners on that could be a false economy if a company were
to be sued not only for unfair dismissal but false accusations of drug
abuse,'' he warned.
Mr David Wallace, diagnostic consultant with Bio-Generics, said: ''We
have been doing a lot of negotiating with companies. We have some
contracts and several large companies are in the process of introducing
tests but confidentiality is paramount to them.
''They are interested not so much because they have a particular
problem but because they think they should do it to show a public
awareness of the problem. American companies are more in tune with drug
testing.
''Safety is always something employers have to be aware of but my
impression is that it is not so much a question of personal problems but
of community involvement, to make sure drugs are not being used or
traded within the work premises.''
Mr Wallace said that, legally, pre-employment testing was no problem.
To begin testing an existing workforce, he recommended prior warning
that this was going to be a new part of the contract of employment, with
minimum notice of six weeks.
Thanks to the growth in commercial sales from the company's other
products in mainstream medical testing, they are providing the kits free
to parents, who can get them through the recommendation of their family
doctor.

THE clouds of gloom still rolling up from the south should not be
allowed to cast their shadow over Scotland's property market. The
problem for builders, estate agents and house sellers north of border is
that perceptions of the market here continue to be affected by the bad
news from England.
The key differences between the markets north and south of the border
are these: while house sales are not booming in Scotland, nor are they
moribund -- houses which are put on the market at the right price will
sell; most importantly, values in Scotland are still holding up, which
means that negative equity is not a real factor in the Scottish property
equation, according to the latest statistics from the TSB.
The bank's Quarterly Scottish House Price Monitor shows that the
average domestic Scottish property rose in value by 3.9% in the three
months to the end of July 1995.
This change exactly reverses the fall experienced in the previous
quarter. The index is adjusted for changes in geographic area, property
type and proportion of first-time buyers. However, compared to the same
quarter one year ago, the index is showing a fall of 4.3%. It now seems
clear, from the bank's graphs, that Scotland had a temporary market
surge during the second quarter of last year which gradually dissipated
until the index turned up again during the second quarter of this year.
The TSB says these figures confirm the seasonal recovery of the market
from its depressed state in the autumn and winter of 1994/95. Meanwhile,
the volume of new mortgages has increased significantly in the quarter
to end of July 1995 compared to the previous quarter -- but is still
down on the same quarter one year ago.
First-time buyers continue to display confidence accounting for 38% of
all new mortgage transactions, a share similar to that in the same
period last year.
The bank's statistics also show that negative equity has not made any
real inroads into the Scottish market. The average price paid by
first-time buyers has been static for the last three years, with only a
slight indication of a fall in the last two quarters. ''There is little
evidence in these figures of significant negative equity,'' says a TSB
spokesman.
The bank calculates that Scotland's negative equity is confined to
first-time buyers who purchased a flat or maisonette in Aberdeen,
Dundee, or Glasgow one year ago with a 100% mortgage -- and who have not
made any capital repayments.
''There may be individual cases where negative equity exists but,
overall, it is not a Scottish problem,'' says the bank spokesman.
These latest results confirm the underlying strength of the Scottish
housing market. Despite the year-on-year fall in activity, the overall
price index is now rising, the number of new mortgages has increased,
first-time buyers continue to be active in the market and there is no
real evidence of a negative equity problem. ''Sustainable'' is the most
appropriate adjective to describe the current state of the Scottish
housing market, says the TSB.
This optimistic outlook is boosted by Scottish Office statistics which
show that new private-sector house building increased during the first
quarter of this year. Between January and March there were an estimated
4,903 starts in Scotland, an increase of 22% on the same period in 1994.
* Meanwhile, Stewart Saunders, Lothian's largest independent firm of
estate agents, has announced record sales of #1.95 million for July.
This is an increase of 40% on sales in the same month in 1994 an 1993
and is almost double the figure or 1992. The average price of properties
sold during July was #84,000, with five sales in the #100,000-#150,000
bracket and one over #250,000. Eight of the properties sold were new.
''This is a remarkable result, as the first two weeks of the month
were quiet, as is normal for this time of year,'' said David Alves,
managing director of Stewart Saunders. ''It's significant that the
figures are more than 20% higher than our previous record, achieved in
1989. Demand in the second-hand market is still not particularly
bouyant. Accurate pricing, enthusiastic and professional marketing, and
careful attention to presentation are still vital ingredients in
securing a sale.''

GRAMPIAN'S chief constable said yesterday he doubted whether there was
a chief constable in the land who really believed enforcement policies
were successful in dealing with the drugs problem.
Dr Ian Oliver said the police were highly successful at catching drugs
dealers but that enforcement was simply like ''whispering in a steel
mill''.
He made his views known in the context of a seminar which his force
will hold in Aberdeen in October at which the theme will be that the
correct and long-term way to tackle drugs in society is through
education to reduce demand.
The conference message will be that everyone should have a commitment
to face up to drugs, including every company in the country and where
safety -- either of the public or of employees -- is an issue that
policy should include random testing of employees.
Dr Oliver said: ''Random tests in the workplace are only a small part
of the whole issue. The true position is that the whole of the UK is
awash with illegal drugs and if anyone wants them they can get them.
Coincidentally, there are a whole lot of people who for a variety of
reasons don't know this or do not want to know.
''We believe that education is more important than enforcement and it
is no longer any good society wringing its hands and saying someone
should be doing something. The message from the conference will be that
you should be doing something and that includes every employer who has a
safety issue to deal with.''
The conference, which will address the issue of both random testing
and ''with cause'' testing in the workplace, is sponsored by a number of
companies, including Shell UK, BT, and British Airways, which already
have urine and breath testing for drugs and alcohol. Dr Oliver
emphasised yesterday that the main object was to assist people with
problems to address them.
The Scottish Police Federation's deputy general secretary, Mr Tom
Rowatt, said: ''While we are not really any different from any other
occupation in this respect, I think that before any such policy happened
we would have to see plainly that there was an issue that was giving
concern. There seems to be absolutely no evidence of this.''
The chairman of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, Glasgow
lawyer Alan Miller, said: ''You cannot introduce mandatory drugs testing
in the workplace without consent. It would have to be a voluntary or
contractual agreement, otherwise it would be a gross interference with
people's liberties and privacy. Taking a sample might even constitute an
assault.''

THE Scottish National Party yesterday unveiled its vision of a
post-independence welfare state and stepped into an immediate
controversy over whether its proposals were uncosted pie-in-the-sky.
The party conference in Perth next month will debate an agenda well to
the left of Mr Tony Blair's New Labour but leaders faced an immediate
accusation yesterday that the lack of any funding proposals undermined
their aspirations.
The SNP agenda to be discussed at Perth will include a motion calling
for:
* Full employement.
* A minimum wage at the level accepted by trade unions.
* Social security ''which ensures that no member of the community
needs to live in poverty''.
* A basic income payment covering the jobless, elderly, the disabled,
students, and lone parents.
The plans were condemned by Scottish Conservative chairman Sir Michael
Hirst, who said: ''The SNP is the most left-wing party in Scottish
politics. At the conference, we will see the usual rag-bag mixture of
unrealistice, unworkable, and uncosted proposals.''
SNP chief executive Mr Michael Russell said a series of policy
documents would be published over the next few weeks on economic and
financial details.

TROUBLED comic Michael Barrymore last night received an ovation as his
show, Strike It Lucky, was named Quiz Programme of the Year at the
National Television Awards.
Obviously moved by the emotion of the audience just days after he
admitted being gay, he said: ''Thank you for giving me the encouragement
to carry on at the moment.''
He is now living apart from his wife of 19 years, Cheryl, who remains
his manager.
Speaking on stage at the Wembley Conference Centre, where he received
his award from Hughie Green, Barrymore joked: ''May I first of all
apologise about the cut of my suit. It is not the best and my wardrobe
has been thrown out.''
Barrymore's reception was one of the warmest of an evening in which he
was nominated for, and won, three awards, the others being Most Popular
Entertainment Presenter and Most Popular Family Programme, for
Barrymore.
Host of the evening, GMTV presenter Eamonn Holmes, said: ''In the
light of the events of the last couple of weeks, we really appreciate
Michael being here tonight.''
Later, Barrymore, 43, made a moving speech about the problems he has
had since he admitted that he was gay.
He said: ''If I had known it was going to turn out like this, I would
have opened my mouth years ago. I'm probably going to come out another
two times.''
He thanked his fans who have deluged him with letters of support and
joked: ''I had a telegram from Hugh Grant which said, 'Dear Michael,
thank you, thank you, oh thank you'.''
Other winners were: Most Popular Drama -- Soldier Soldier; Factual
Entertainment -- Animal Hospital Week; Talk Show -- Des O'Connor
Tonight; Actor -- Robson Green; Soap -- Coronation Street; Comedy

<HEADLINE>Historic vote for Labour candidate. Ayr to select best woman for the job</HEADLINE>

LABOUR Party members in Ayr will be involved in a piece of political
history in 12 days when they are asked to choose a prospective
parliamentary candidate from a list containing only women.
As the debate rages within the party nationally over whether the
practice of women-only shortlists should continue after the
''experimental'' phase, The Herald has learned that members in Ayr will
be asked to choose from five candidates on September 10.
The successful candidate will go forward to contest the seat currently
held for the Conservatives by Mr Phil Gallie.
The combination of a tiny majority, boundary changes that have robbed
Mr Gallie of thousands of potential votes in the affluent suburbs of
Alloway and Doonfoot, and overall discontent with the Government make
the seat eminently winnable for Labour.
Five candidates from a wide variety of political backgrounds have been
chosen to go to the people in a contest that will be a mixture of
mini-convention in Ayr and postal ballots.
After the votes are counted, having been cast by each member on a
single transferable vote system, the successful candidate will be
announced. The candidates are:
* Ms Neelam Backshi, currently a Strathclyde Regional councillor
representing Maryhill and Summerston who was unsuccessful in gaining a
nomination for a seat on the new Glasgow unitary authority. She was
involved in an industrial tribunal recently when she claimed racial
discrimination had led to her failing to be considered for a job with
Falkirk District Council as an equal opportunities officer. Ms Backshi
has the backing of the constituency women's section.
* Ms Cathy Jamieson, a former Strathclyde social worker who now works
with homeless teenagers. She has held office in the Cunninghame South
constituency of Mr Brian Donohoe for many years and is also involved
with the left-wing Campaign Group in Scotland. Ms Jamieson is backed by
the Co-op movement, TGWU, and the influential Ayr North branch of the
party. She has the backing of South of Scotland Euro-MP Alex Smith.
* Ms Renee Gillan, a librarian with Kyle and Carrick District Council
who is also a shop steward with Unison and has union and district
backing.
* Ms Elaine Murray, who represents Ayr South on Strathclyde Regional
Council since winning it from the Tories at the last election. She has
also won a seat on the shadow South Ayrshire Council representing
Dundonald.
* Mrs Sandra Osborne, worker with Women's Aid and the member for
Whitletts on the new South Ayrshire authority. There is heavy branch
backing for the wife of last Labour candidate Alistair Osborne, who came
so close to winning the seat from the Conservatives.
Political observers in the area await the outcome of the contest with
interest but what appears to be most important to the party is that the
strongest candidate possible is returned without even a whiff of sour
grapes from powerful male figures in the party who may have fancied
their chances.
It appears that the contest may be between Ms Jamieson, with her
Campaign connections seen as being on the left of the party, and Mrs
Osborne, who is considered more moderate but still strongly supporting
the important issues of women's rights and equal opportunities.
Ms Backshi is the most experienced of the candidates as far as local
authority work is concerned but many voters may be looking for a more
local figure to represent the interests of an area that values its
''independence''.
Councillor Murray has not been regarded as forthright enough on some
issues by sections of the party and was described by one party insider
as ''not hungry enough'' to have persuaded enough supporters.
The final choice, in common with those who choose her, will make
history as Mr Blair has made it clear he considers the move a one-off
process.

Nato war planes, believed to be from Nato, roared over the darkened
skies of Sarajevo early this morning and bombed Serb-held areas to the
east and south of the city.
The planes could be heard in clear skies above the Bosnian capital,
after which distant flashes could be seen and explosions heard.
Sarajevo, which is virtually without electricity, was darkened.
United Nations and Nato officials had been pondering a response to
Monday's mortar bomb massacre in the Bosnian capital in which 37 people
were killed and 85 wounded.
UN investigators said that attack was carried out by the Bosnian Serb
forces who surround the capital.
The CNN television network in Washington said US officials confirmed
that Nato airstrikes had started against Serb locations around Sarajevo.
The network also quoted the officials as saying earlier reports that
Nato was contemplating artillery attacks by the British and French Rapid
Reaction Forces in the region were meant to confuse Bosnian Serbs until
the air strikes had begun.
It quoted Pentagon sources that the first wave of jets intended to
destroy the Bosnian Serb air defence system, clearing the way for
further strikes all over the area, particularly artillery sites. The
sources said the jets, mainly US war planes, would ''pound away'' at
Serb targets for up to three or four days.
It was a similar tactic to the Gulf war.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, taking seriously the threat of
Western military power, struck a conciliatory tone and said the Serbs
were willing to accept a new US peace plan as a basis for negotiations.
The Contact Group of France, Britain, Germany, Russia and the United
States trying to negotiate a peace deal had agreed that military
reprisals should be carried out.

CAROLINE Hall defied near gale-force winds yesterday on her way to a
career-best closing round of 64 and a maiden American Express Tour
victory in the Ford Stimoral Danish Open at Vejle.
The 21-year-old from Bristol set a new Tour record for a 54-hole
tournament with her 15-under-par aggregate of 201, which left her eight
strokes clear of Australian Corinne Dibnah. Dale Reid was the best of
the Scots, when a 69 pulled her up into a share of fifth place.
Afterwards, Hall, a former Curtis Cup player, said: ''I was nervous at
the start of the day and felt I had to put pressure on Corinne. And she
gave me an opening when she took three putts on the first green.''
At the same hole, Hall hit a wedge third shot to eight feet for a
birdie 4, then holed from 20 feet for a 2 at the short second hole on
her way to the turn in 32.
She then holed another 20-footer for a birdie at the tenth and sealed
her first win since turning professional two years ago with birdies at
three of the last four holes.

The U2 spy plane which crashed shortly after take-off yesterday at RAF
Fairford, in Gloucestershire, killing its pilot, was en route for Bosnia
to pinpoint Serb gun positions for Nato air strikes.
The reconnaissance mission was ordered after the Serb mortar attack.
The pilot of the U2R, Captain David Hawkins, successfully ejected but
died from his injuries at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Swindon, a
USAF spokesman said.
Mr Chris Brothers, who runs a petrol station near the base perimeter
fence, saw the aircraft crash. He said: ''As it circled after take-off,
it was obvious it had some sort of problem. When it came back round, it
was very close to the runway and one wing touched the ground.
''It then veered off to the left of the runway. I saw something red,
like an anorak, catapult out of it. It must have been the ejector-seat
and parachute. The plane then crashed with a massive impact and a great
fireball erupted close to our petrol station.''
Last night, a US Air Force investigation was under way into the cause
of the crash.
The U2, which first flew 40 years ago and is little more than a
high-powered glider equipped with cameras and electronic sensors, was
part of a precision location strike system squadron normally located at
Beale Air Force base in California. The squadron belongs to the US 9th
Strategic Reconnaissance wing.
The decision to authorise a manned surveillance flight came after the
loss of two remotely-piloted Predator aircraft over Bosnia earlier this
month. Five of the experimental Predators, equipped with high-resolution
video and stills cameras, were deployed last month to Gjader airforce
base in Albania to support Nato operations over the Bosnian war zone.
The aircraft can be controlled in video-arcade style from the ground
500 miles away and can loiter over a target area for up to 24 hours at
heights over 25,000ft.

been shot down.

THE leader of the republic of Georgia and former Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze escaped with cuts and bruises when a
massive car bomb blasted his motorcade yesterday.
He condemned the bombers as cowards and terrorists.
Mr Shevardnadze, 67, was taken to hospital with cuts caused by flying
glass after a Soviet-made Niva four-wheel-drive vehicle exploded outside
the Georgian parliament building in the capital, Tbilisi. His face and
hands were splattered with blood.
Mr Shevardnadze, who worked under President Mikhail Gorbachev, had
been on his way to a ceremony to sign Georgia's new constitution. It
gives a future president strong powers and Mr Shevardnadze is the
front-runner in the November election.
A furious Mr Shevardnadze said of his attackers: ''They want the Mafia
to run the country. They will not get it.''
His car was said to be leaving the inner courtyard of the parliament
when the bomb exploded nearby. Several other cars were destroyed.
Press secretary Ramaz Sakvarelidze said: ''It's clear Shevardnadze's
enemies tried to assassinate the head of our state to stop the signing
ceremony.''
Several other people were reported injured when the blast shattered
all the windows on one side of the parliament building.
Georgia, a former Soviet republic, has been wracked by crime, coups,
and civil war since it became independent in 1991.
Mr Shevardnadze, who helped end the Cold War, resigned as Soviet
Foreign Minister in December 1990. He returned to lead his native
Georgia after its first elected president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, was
ousted in a coup.
He foiled several assassination attempts as Georgia's Communist leader
from 1972 to 1985. During Georgia's 1993 war in the breakaway Abkhazia
region, he went to the front line and survived several near-misses from
shells.

CELTIC asked the SFA yesterday to intervene with Europe's governing
football body UEFA and spell out their concerns over the European Cup
Winners' Cup clash in Georgia in two weeks.
They did so after receiving warnings from the Foreign Office in London
about the volatile situation in the relatively new republic, once part
of the Soviet Union.
Celtic supporters also called for the tie to be cancelled and warned
the team should refuse to go if the situation in Georgia is as volatile
as reported.
An official Foreign Office document states quite clearly and
chillingly: ''Uncontrolled possession of firearms is widespread
throughout Georgia.''
It adds: ''Visits to most parts of Georgia can be made in relative
safety although travel at night outside the capital Tbilisi should be
avoided if possible.''
Celtic have been drawn to play Dynamo Batoumi, a team from a Black Sea
resort town close to the border with Turkey and around 200 miles away
from the nation's capital.
Yesterday, alarmed by the Foreign Office report, Celtic sent security
chief Mr George Douglas to Batoumi to take a first-hand look at the
situation and assess the potential for trouble. But, while the Scottish
Cup-holders are making representations to UEFA, it would seem they have
little chance of having the venue changed.
SFA chief executive Jim Farry confirmed that he had spoken to UEFA on
Celtic's behalf.
But a spokesman for UEFA said last night: ''A team from Yugoslavia
played in Batoumi last week in the preliminary round of this competition
and there was no trouble whatsoever. As far as we are concerned, the
game will take place on September 14 as scheduled.''
Celtic's fears were intensified by the Foreign Office suggestion that
''incidents of mugging, theft, and pick-pocketing in all cities are
increasing''.
There is also a diphtheria epidemic raging through parts of the
country and warnings to travellers include special safety precautions
once you are in your hotel room. Locking a door does not seem to be
sufficient.
But it is UEFA and not the Foreign Office who will decide Celtic's
fate and last night it looked as if the game would simply be given the
go-ahead.
The official observer, Dr Edgar Obertufer of the Swiss FA, said last
night: ''I was there last week with the team from Yugoslavia and there
was another team from Macedonia in the country playing in the UEFA Cup
at the same time. Neither of these teams had any complaints about the
situation. Nor did I.''
There is little doubt that the observer's report -- and Dr Obertufer
is one of the most experienced officials on the Continent -- will carry
the day with the European Union and Celtic will be forced to make the
long journey to the other side of Europe. That in itself offers up
further problems.
The Georgian Consulate in London warned that the airport at Batoumi
would not be big enough to take a long-haul jet. The recommended route
appears to be travelling to Istanbul and from there going into Batoumi
24 hours before the game, returning to Turkey after the match, and
flying back from there on Friday.
Celtic would then be left trying to prepare for a game the next day
while combating travel fatigue and a four-hour time difference.

THE British UN Commander in Bosnia, General Rupert Smith, yesterday
prepared retaliatory action aimed at punishing the Bosnian Serbs for the
mortar attack of a Sarajevo market which killed 37 people and wounded
more than 80. The UN said it had been confirmed Bosnian Serb forces were
responsible. In London, Mr Major was contacted by French President
Jacques Chirac and spent 15 minutes discussing the Bosnian crisis,
Downing Street said.

THE U2 spy plane which crashed shortly after take-off yesterday at RAF
Fairford, in Gloucestershire, killing its pilot, was en route for Bosnia
to pinpoint Serb gun positions for possible Nato air strikes.
The reconnaissance mission was ordered after the Serb mortar attack on
a crowded Sarajevo street on Monday which left 37 civilians dead and
scores badly wounded, paving the way for retaliatory action by allied
air forces in the area.
The pilot of the U2R, Captain David Hawkins, ejected but died from his
injuries at Princess Margaret Hospital, Swindon, a USAF spokesman said.
Mr Chris Brothers, who runs a petrol station near the base perimeter
fence, saw the aircraft crash. He said: ''As it circled after take-off
it was obvious it had some sort of problem. When it came back round it
was very close to the runway and one wing touched the ground.
''It then veered off to the left of the runway. I saw something red,
like an anorak, catapult out of it. It must have been the ejector-seat
and parachute. The plane then crashed with a massive impact, and a great
fireball erupted close to our petrol station.
Last night, a US Air Force investigation was under way into the cause
of the crash.
The U2, which first flew 40 years ago and is little more than a
high-powered glider equipped with cameras and electronic sensors, was
part of a precision location strike system squadron normally located at
Beale Air Force base in California. The squadron belongs to the US 9th
Strategic Reconnaissance wing.
The decision to authorise a manned surveillance flight came after the
loss of two remotely-piloted and top-secret Predator aircraft over
Bosnia earlier this month.
Five of the experimental Predators, equipped with high-resolution
video and stills cameras, were deployed last month to Gjader airforce
base in Albania to support Nato operations over the Bosnian war zone.
The aircraft can be controlled in video-arcade style from the ground
500 miles away and can loiter over a target area for up to 24 hours at
heights over 25,000ft.
US operators in Albania reported the first loss of contact with a
Predator over Bosnia on August 11 but would not confirm whether it had
been shot down. A second was ordered to self-destruct after it
encountered ''difficulties'' over the same area three days later.
RAF Fairford, near Cirencester, the scene of yesterday's fatal crash,
was formerly the home base of 15 US Air Force KC135 tanker aircraft.
Kept on a care and maintenance basis since the withdrawal of major US
Air Force units from the UK, is still used for clandestine
reconnaissance missions and Nato exercises.
It was propelled into the limelight on June 3, 1980, when its tanker
squadron, part of the US 11th Strategic Group, was scrambled in response
to a mistaken nuclear alert.

STRATHCLYDE Police, which managed earlier this year to reach --
through the persistence of Chief Constable Leslie Sharp -- the
establishment authorised in 1975, will get approval today to recruit
another 260 operational officers.
For months, the Scottish Office has been studying the case put forward
by Mr Sharp and his police authority at Strathclyde Regional Council to
give the force operational strength commensurate with today's workloads.
It has been anticipated for days that the Scottish Office Home Affairs
Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, will make the announcement when
he visits the force headquarters in Glasgow today.
The police authority chairman, Councillor James Jennings, said last
night he was ''very hopeful'' that that would be the outcome of the
visit.
He anticipated that permission also would be granted for phase six of
the force's civilianisation programme to go ahead, releasing another
major body of officers for operational duties, which would increase the
number of new personnel on the streets to more than 400.
He confirmed that the new wave of officers would be paid for out of
overtime money already in the force's budget. The additional officers
would mean a corresponding drop in the need for overtime to be paid out,
freeing up the resource.
For years, the force strength of Strathclyde has been a political bone
of contention between Labour-controlled Strathclyde Region and the
Tories at the Scottish Office.
Mr Sharp forced his way through the political battle lines, recruiting
440 officers last year to raise the force numbers to 6954 -- the
establishment which was authorised 20 years ago when the force was
created. He did not stop there, announcing his intention to seek
additional constables to cope with the hugely-increased workload the
force has faced in the last 10 years.
Meantime, applications closed earlier this week for the job of chief
constable, which will be vacant when Mr Sharp retires on December 31.
The #86,988 post has attracted six applicants, two of them from
Scotland, and not all are from chief constables.
The police authority will meet on September 25 to draw up a short
leet, which will be passed to the Scottish Secretary, who either
approves the leet or weeds out applicants he considers to be unsuitable.
Interviews for the post will start on October 9.

THE Government is poised to offer a national minimum wage structure
throughout the NHS, a concession which could resolve the long-running
pay dispute.
The stalemate had threatened to escalate into industrial action within
weeks.
However, senior NHS managers are arranging talks with unions
representing around 900,000 staff, most of whom have opposed the
Government's insistence on offering just 1% nationally together with the
prospect of more, up to a further 2% in the case of nurses, via local
negotiations.
NHS sources suggest the call to fresh talks will come this morning
from the health service director of human resources, Mr Ken Jarrold, and
that negotiations could resume next week.
Although the Royal Colleges of Nursing and Midwives, both outwith the
TUC, had virtually accepted the existing situation, the other unions and
associations, led by Unison which represents about 440,000 NHS workers,
have opposed rigorously what they see as a move to sideline them.
They are all currently balloting on various forms of industrial
action, including a one-day strike by Unison members, with the results
imminent and action expected to be called from around the middle of
September.
It is understood that in an attempt to head off industrial action, the
NHS is now prepared to discuss national minimum rates which would be
upgraded each year to reflect the outcome of the previous year's
bargaining.
National union officials would be involved in determining the level at
which the minimum rates would be set each year, thus retaining
substantial union involvement.
The NHS unions, the bulk of which had seen the move towards more
localised bargaining as an attack on their central role, are expected to
be more receptive to such a compromise. It would, in effect, see wage
rates set locally but with national fall-back levels agreed subsequently
to ensure that no NHS grade or location can fall below nationally agreed
minima.
Such a nationally agreed pay level, which could be improved upon
locally, and upgraded in advance of the next year's negotiations, is
seen as the most likely formula for resolving the long-running dispute.
The dispute began in early March when the workers review body for
600,000 nurses and midwives recommended a 1% across-the-board rise. It
was subsequently offered to administrative and clerical grades, hospital
ancillaries, and ambulance workers, all of whom rejected it.
NHS staff who attacked the offer were told that individual trusts
would increase the 1% to around 3%, and Health Minister Gerald Malone
pleaded with nurses to settle the dispute as most would get 3%.
However, while almost all of the 530 NHS trusts have now topped up the
1% national award with local offers, many of them were linked to
efficiency ''strings''.
The dispute escalated as the full extent of the conditions emerged.
Unions claimed many of the deals meant cuts in holiday, night-shift and
unsocial-hours' allowances, longer working hours, regrading, and
acceptance of local pay bargaining.
In June, the 300,000 members of the traditionally moderate Royal
College of Nursing voted overwhelmingly to scrap their 79-year-old
no-strike clause in favour of one allowing limited industrial action.
There have also been arguments over how many trusts have actually
offered the full 3% with the union benchmark ''no strings'' test.
In Scotland, the decision by Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary to offer the
basic 1% -- the lowest in the country -- was described as ''absolutely
outrageous'' by the RCN, who said only nine out of 47 Scottish Trusts
had made 3% no-strings-attached offers.
Across the UK, Unison said almost all trusts had made offers but only
150 met the ''no strings criteria'' although the Government claimed the
number was much larger.
There have been few settlements and there will still need to be much
negotiating before the threat of industrial action is lifted.
Asked whether talks were likely to be reopened, Unison head of health,
Mr Bob Abberley, said last night: ''I hope so as there is a need to find
a solution because we are moving ever nearer to industrial action.''
