Leaders of the new City of Glasgow Council have taken formal steps to
eradicate the bitter factional conflict that has dominated events at the
City Chambers for many years.
In a motion to be placed before the Labour Group for approval, the
Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, argues that the authority of the
Labour Group and the party organisation would be compromised if ad-hoc
groups met in advance of group or party meetings with the express
intention of influencing group or party decisions.
This is a direct reference to the unsavoury battles between supporters
of Councillor Patrick Lally and his long-standing rival, Councillor Jean
McFadden.
Councillor Gould confirmed yesterday that any breach of the new ruling
would be dealt with under disciplinary procedures.
Meanwhile, the new council's executive committee has drawn up its
committee structure and the people to serve and as chairpersons.
These are: Policy and Resources, Councillor Robert Gould; Social Work,
Mary Beckett; Commercial Operations, Direct Labour Organisations, Denis
Murphy; Finance, Eamon Fitzgerald; General Purposes, Mohammed Sarwar;
Personnel, William O'Rourke; Property Services, William Butler;
Licensing Committee, Audrey Strain; Licensing Board, Jim Coleman;
Education, Malcolm Green; Housing, James McCarron; Roads, Charles
Gordon; Parks and Recreation, James Mutter; Planning, Patrick Lally;
Protective Services, Alex Mosson; Arts and Culture, Frank McAveety.

OVER a period of four months in 1986 Greg Norman stood on the brink of
completing the unthinkable feat -- winning all four major championships
in the same season.
But this golfing quadrilateral in the end remained inviolate as the
Australian faltered in his attempt to occupy a unique, and probably
impregnable, niche in the game's history.
Achieving instead what became known as the Saturday Slam by leading
after the third round of the Masters, the US Open, the Open, and the US
PGA Championships did not leave him with any profound sense of
accomplishment and, perhaps as part of the mental defence mechanism
adapted by many professionals, Norman's memory of those occasions is
decidedly sketchy.
However, the weather which greeted players and spectators for the
second official session of practice at the US Open yesterday must have
reminded him of the dreadful conditions which prevailed in the first
round in 1986.
Rain and wind swept over the course and the USGA official who
remarked: ''Welcome to the British Open'' all those years ago could
justifiably have repeated that sardonic term of phrase.
But before he set out for his first practice round, Norman confessed
to having little recall of the course at the Shinnecock Hills Club in
Long Island, New York, where the second of these titles slipped from his
grasp nine years ago and where this year's championship, celebrating the
centennial of the USGA's founding, begins tomorrow.
Understandably, too, Norman did not care to revive any vivid
recollections of the altercation he had that Saturday afternoon when,
halfway down the fourteenth fairway, a spectator -- in the highest
traditions of the rude and raucous New York sports follower -- shouted
the word ''Choker'' at him.
Older and wiser now that he has passed into golf's middle age with his
fortieth birthday earlier this year, Norman believes he is not only a
better player than he was then, but that his game is better disciplined.
''I'm not so wildly aggressive as I used to be,'' he declared. ''More
like controlled aggression.''
Certainly, Norman only two weeks immediately made his presence felt
again by winning the Memorial tournament on his first competitive outing
after the five-week period for rest and recreation he usually allows
himself at this time of year. But, mentally and physically fresh as he
was, Norman was not surprised at the victory, his thirteenth on the US
tour.
Having followed that winning performance by finishing equal fourth on
Sunday in the Kemper Open, a tournament he might also have won, Norman,
has, for what the accolade is worth, been installed as favourite for the
championship -- recognition he would rather have than be thought of as
just another prawn in the cocktail shaken by a 156-strong field.
''The most important thing for me is to win,'' he said. ''Otherwise, I
might just as well be second, fifth, or twenty-fourth.''
At the moment, on a rating up to 10, Norman feels his game stands
about 7[1/2] and that he would only award himself the maximum if the
completed 72 holes without a bogey.
That, incidentally, proved to be the way in which Raymond Floyd became
the then oldest winner of the title, for his closing score of 66 yielded
nothing to the card -- evidence too of the improvisation and imagination
made necessary by this course, of all those on which the US championship
is held, and especially in the chip shots.
Such an elimination of error on this 6944-yard course, whose par is 70
and which, although open to sea breezes from north and south, more
resembles a British heathland course in character than a traditional
links is highly unlikely, especially as, at least to begin with, it will
likely play to its full length.
This is because heavy rain has fallen over and since last weekend. The
softened fairways have, in effect, been made wider and although the
greens will be fast enough the record of 65, set in the final round in
1986 by Mark Calcavecchia, Lanny Wadkins, and Chip Beck, could well be
bettered.

MOST teams like to get in a little shooting practise prior to a big
game, but New Zealand captain Frank Bunce took the opportunity quite
literally yesterday when the Kiwis dropped in to the South African
police training school in Pretoria.
The New Zealanders now have England firmly in their sights in Sunday's
semi-final in Cape Town, but it is Will Carling's men who will be hoping
to shoot down the All Blacks' hopes.
And yesterday New Zealand officials shrugged off suggestions that they
are involved in a plot to unsettle South African rugby. Remarks by a
former Kiwi, alleging that the Springboks might resort to ''bribing
referees,'' prompted an angry response from the hosts.
But Brian Lochore, New Zealand's campaign manager, said, ''It's
laughable. These guys have been around a long time. If they were going
to be bribed, they'd be well-bribed by now. We're not part of that
outburst.''

SCOTLAND have moved above England in the world ratings organised by
FIFA after a jump of eleven places inside the past six months, writes
Ken Gallacher.
The Scots are now in twenty-first place after a succession of results
in the European Championships which have enhanced their standing in the
eyes of the world soccer chiefs.
And, England, after their disappointing displays have gone from
eighteenth position to twenty-second, allowing Craig Brown's team to
edge ahead of them.
Yesterday, though, there was little gloating over the new ratings from
Park Gardens. There was some satisfaction, but the feeling was that the
European Championships mattered more than any FIFA listings at the
moment.
SFA Chief Executive Jim Farry said: ''It's always nice to see the
nation rising in the ratings, especially when you are looking at those
compiled from around the world.
''But all we are concerned with just now is being among the top
sixteen in Europe. To do that we have to qualify for the finals of the
European Championships next summer.
''If we do, then there will be something tangible to celebrate.''
Brazil, obviously, are first in the ratings, followed by Italy, then
Spain.

AS Linford Christie yesterday insisted that there was no going back on
his decision to retire at the end of this season, he was urged to think
again by UK and world athletics authorities -- and by Allan Wells, the
1980 Olympic 100 metres champion.
Christie's coach, Ron Roddan, and his agent, Sue Barratt, believe the
World, Olympic, European and Commonwealth 100m champion will not change
his mind.
In an emotional outburst on a late-night ITV programme, Sport in
Question, Christie said he could no longer cope with media harrassment
and that he would quit without defending his Olympic crown in Atlanta
next year.
''I can't take any more, I just can't,'' he said. ''I'm at the stage
where I am so fed up I could walk away any day. I used to love the
sport, but it doesn't mean that much to me any more. Athletics is not my
life. There are other things. When I get this season over, that's it.
I'm definitely not going to the Olympic Games.''
''I knew before the programme that Linford had had enough from the
media,'' said Ms Barratt. ''I was apprehensive about what he might
say.''
Many of those who called Barratt yesterday questioned the link between
the spontaneous announcement of his decision and Christie's unaccustomed
catalogue of defeats this year -- four in nine races. They also raised
the issue of current negotiation with the British Athletic Federation
over an increase in his appearance fee, reputedly from #25,000 per race
to #35,000.
Ms Barratt insisted that neither factor had played any part. ''He has
not fallen out of love with the sport, and it didn't matter a toss that
he had not been announced as team captain for the European Cup final,''
she said. In fact, he was confirmed as captain yesterday afternoon.
''That was irrelevant. His decision is wholly because of the way he has
been hounded by the press.
''If Linford did change his mind, I'd be pleased, because I believe he
can win the world title and the Olympics next year. But he says he will
retire, and I believe he will.''
0 Roddan also believes Christie's is no idle threat. ''Linford has
been talking about it for some time, and I think he has really made his
mind up,'' he said. ''I've always said that Linford will not be fully
appreciated until he has gone. It's probably a good thing to go out when
he is still at the top.''
However, Tony Ward, the BAF spokesman said: ''I would prefer to wait
until after the world championships to see whether he sticks by his
decision.''
Christopher Winner, spokesman for the International Amateur Athletic
Federation who was branded ''a worm'' in one of several personal run-ins
with Christie, said: ''He would do well to stop reading the papers. He
knows that the respect and admiration of the sporting public is bigger
than media assumptions.''
Former Olympic champion Wells is perhaps the man with the most
perceptive appreciation of the pressures under which Christie races.
''People like us are on a tight spring, under control,'' he said. ''When
the gun goes, that's the only time you let go. Linford let it go at the
wrong time on TV.
''The event does not lend itself to a happy-go-lucky existence. It is
very intense, a lonely life, and I think he should reconsider in the
cold light of day.''
Although beaten in his most recent 100m race, in Rome last Thursday,
Christie clocked 10.15sec, in poor conditions, against 10.09 at the same
stage last year. The average of his 100m appearances this year is
actually better than at the same time last season, but the number of
defeats represent a new experience. He is due to compete over 100m in
Nuremberg tomorrow.
Christie has said in the past that, on the track, he believes he is
not just fighting American and other top athletes. ''I have got to fight
my own camp. The media are supposed to be in your camp.''
And talk of retirement were heard from world pole vault record holder
Sergei Bubka, who says he plans to give up athletics in ''two or three
years,'' citing constant pressure a the reason.

RAITH ROVERS manager Jimmy Nicholl last night confessed that he knew a
week ago he was unlikely to get the manager's job at Norwich City, but
was determined to go through with the interview in any case.
Said Nicholl after the announcement that his former Northern Ireland
team-mate, Martin O'Neill, had been given the post: ''I was told by
someone close to the club that I wouldn't get the job but I suppose I
just felt I could maybe talk my way into it. I was neither surprised nor
disappointed when I didn't get it.''
Nicholl was aware of the situation when he went down to Norwich on
Monday, the day after chairman Robert Chase had been reported as giving
a clear indication in the south of France that the deal taking the
Kirkcaldy club's manager to East Anglia had already been settled.
''I would say that I will never do this again,'' said Nicholl. ''In
future, if I am in a job and anybody wants me, the only interview I will
do will be the one giving me the job.
''I don't want to do anything that could have me in danger of falling
out with people at my own club again.
Nicholl, who had differences with his board when Kilmarnock wanted to
take him as their manager following the departure of Tommy Burns, did
have permission to speak to Norwich this time but clearly his decision
to go ahead with the discussions has caused a disturbance within the
Stark's Park corridors.
''Now, all I want to do is concentrate on keeping Raith in the premier
division, something we haven't done before.''
Nicholl pointed out that despite the difference of opinion during the
Kilmarnock episode, he and his team went on to win the first division
championship and the Coca-Cola Cup.
The appointment of O'Neill came after he was called to Carrow Road
yesterday afternoon by the chairman, who had by then rejected
suggestions that he had declared a deal had been done with Nicholl.
O'Neill, manager of Wycombe Wanderers and a former Norwich player, had
been the leading candidate for the job vacated by John Deehan in April
but seemed to have distanced himself from it before he went on holiday.
However, despite Nicholl's appearance at the ground on Monday, the
intention clearly was to give O'Neill first refusal.
It is not the first time that Norwich have behaved in bizarre fashion
when it comes to choosing a manager. A few years ago they paraded Phil
Neal at Carrow Road and his appointment seemed assured. However, shortly
afterwards, they brought Mike Walker to the ground to announce that he
was manager.
O'Neill, former captain of Northern Ireland, played for Norwich in two
spells between 1981 and 1983.
In five yars with Wycombe he has led them from the lower half of the
GM Vauxhall Conference to sixth place in the Endsleigh League second
division.

THE history of British gardens is being studied carefully by some of
the major housebuilding companies. As a revival in newly built
period-style homes gets under way to meet market demand, housebuilders
are aware that the garden styles popular early this century are also
returning to favour.
''Because of the extremely competitive nature of the housebuilding
market at present, and the rising price of land, companies which
specialise in building new homes are looking to the past for ways of
increasing the appeal of their latest ranges of homes, and are
landscaping showhome gardens to match,'' said John Corr, a horticultural
expert who specialises in re-creating gardens of historic aristocratic
homes.
''During the past hundred years, the wide gulf in the standard and
sizes of homes has narrowed: fewer palatial residences have been built,
but better homes for the majority has been achieved, and there are more
homeowners in Britain than ever before.''
Building firms have had to adapt to the changing demands of the house
sales market in every decade of the century, and changes in homes and
lifestyles have been as evident in the garden as in the changing
architectural fashions and tastes in interior design.
At the turn of the century, a great variety of house designs were
fashionable, and this was a big help to the Edwardian builders who
catered for a wide range of tastes, aspirations, and income levels. The
thriving middle classes were the most important consumers of the time,
and builders lost no time in providing them with suitable homes. By the
turn of the century, one of the greatest booms ever known in domestic
building was under way.
''Deceptively modest-looking houses in a Tudor or Elizabethan cottage
or farmhouse style were built, many designed or inspired by C F A Voysey
or Rennie Mackintosh, while people who wanted a more definite show of
prosperity chose Jacobean-style manor houses, or a neo-Georgian
'squire's' house with large bay windows and imposing classic columned
porches. And all of these homes had landscaped gardens to match,'' John
explained.
These individually designed houses would have cost from #2000 to
#4000, probably less than the annual income of the successful
professionals and businessmen who commissioned them. It was this
comparatively low cost of building, combined with low taxes and an
expanding economy which encouraged the middle classes to buy more
ambitious homes.
The largest market of all during this period was the suburban house
for the middle class, and because of the need to produce houses quickly
at competitive prices, fashionable period influences were used more
sparingly in these larger scale developments. Small areas of Tudor-style
timber on the upper floors or some Georgian-style red brick fronts with
porches were much admired features, along with some stained glass and a
pretty garden. Gardens were usually complementary to the size and cost
of the house.
The larger houses of the outer suburbs had grounds rather than a front
and back garden, and a conservatory joined to one side of the house.
Middle class houses were visible from the street with quite short front
gardens, but larger more pleasant gardens at the back which prevented
the houses from being overlooked.
''These gardens were a great joy to their early occupants, many of
whom had come from gloomy terraced houses in smoky districts close to
city centres. The new, green, fresh suburban homes with fair-sized
gardens were a source of pleasure and a mark of their achievement,''
John said.
The house builders who consult John Corr for advice on the gardens
which accompany new homes are selling in a very different market today.
The less buoyant atmosphere of the nineties reflects the character of
this period, because although there is nostalgia for the romanticised
homes and gardens fashionable in earlier decades, the whole tone of both
homes and gardens is quieter and less extrovert. ''But styles for
gardens still reflect the period house designs which are once more
fashionable,'' John explained.
''Cottage-style homes look best with complementary countrified gardens
with crazy paved paths, rose bushes and rockeries. Large windowed modern
homes need gardens in complete contrast to this countrified
old-worldiness -- they look best set in gardens with simple lawns, wide
paths, cleanly paved courtyards and disciplined flower beds.''
During the seventies and eighties there was a strong trend to improve
and develop the home and particularly the garden -- more money was spent
on outdoor features and garden centres opened throughout the length and
breadth of the Britain. They sold trees and shrubs, flowers, plants and
bulbs, different sorts of fencing, miniature statues and a large
selection of garden furniture.
''This trend continues today, but its underlying thrust is much more
towards improving quality of life than improving the look and value of
the home as a property,'' John said. ''In marked contrast to the
excitement of some earlier decades of this century, there is a somewhat
sombre atmosphere, and this has caused a surprising and unexpected
revival of earlier styles of living and ways of life. For example, the
cheerful look of open solid fuel burning fires has become very popular
again, and many newly built homes have a chimney and a gas coal or
log-effect fire as the central feature in the living room.
''Gardens, which 25 years ago people were expected to give up
cheerfully for the supposed convenience of living in a high rise flat,
have become a greatly valued asset and are listed high on the range of
priorities of today's home buyers.''

Gareth Smyth reports how a TV documentary team has exposed the horror
of Chinese state orphanages where baby girls are left to die of neglect
TODDLERS strapped to bamboo seats with built-in potties rock
mindlessly back and forth for hours on end. Babies are left unattended
in cots soaked through with their own urine.
In 100[DEG] heat, with viruses rampant, infants are strapped five to a
bed in dingy halls. One in five will die.
Tonight's Channel 4 documentary The Dying Rooms was shot clandestinely
inside Chinese state orphanages by three British film-makers posing as
charity workers.
This is no film for the squeamish. Its harrowing images culminate in
the distressed face of Mei-Ming, her eyes clogged with thick mucus. She
is a sick child left to wither away in a pitch black ''dying room''
where she will lose her uphill battle for life before the film is
completed.
''The workers in the orphanage told us that they'd put her in the
dying room 10 days earlier because she was going to die and there was no
point in wasting energy,'' says the film's director, Brian Woods.
''Clearly she was suffering from the consequences of neglect.''
When Woods later showed the footage of the orphans to a doctor, he
diagnosed untreated gangrene, malnutrition and vitamin A and B
deficiency.
Almost all the infants in the nine orphanages visited by Woods and his
colleagues were girls. Abandoned by their parents, they are just some of
the victims of the collision between the traditional Chinese preference
for sons and the Chinese Government's attempt to curb population growth
by restricting each couple to one child.
According to the Confucian tradition widespread in China, worship of
ancestors by the living is needed for the spiritual wellbeing of the
dead. Individuals are a link in a family chain which stretches into the
past and, hopefully, into the future.
This has practical consequences. When a woman marries, she becomes
part of her husband's family. The couple go to live with the husband's
parents, leaving the wife's parents to fend for themselves in old age.
Throughout Chinese history, baby girls have had lower status than boys
and have proved expendable in times of hardship. They have been eaten
during famines, or simply drowned at birth.
In the early years after the 1949 communist revolution, infanticide
decreased as the position of women improved and concubinage was
outlawed. China seemed set for a period of stability after centuries of
civil war. By the 1960s women were having five children on average.
With a quarter of the world's people living on less than 7% of its
farmland, the regime became alarmed at the growth in population. In 1979
Deng Xiaoping announced that henceforth couples would be allowed only
one child in the cities and two in the countryside.
Under the one-child policy, about 15 million female babies seem to
have ''disappeared''.
The respected Far Eastern Economic Review has calculated that -- with
the sex of the foetus known through ultrasound scans designed to detect
abnormalities -- more than one in 10 female foetuses, 1.7 million a
year, are being aborted.
With the switch away from collective farms, it is easier for peasants
working in remote areas to keep births secret. There are no known
figures for the number of unwanted baby girls who end up in orphanages.
The Dying Rooms quotes an anonymous Chinese journalist who claims that
seven or eight baby girls are abandoned in her village each year. If
this is typical of China, the film suggests, one million are being
abandoned each year across the country.
Few contest that Chinese population methods are draconian. Since 1993
they extend far beyond the one-child policy, explains Brian Woods.
''Beijing decides on the overall number to be born. That is divided
across 29 provinces, down to villagers who are told how many babies they
are allowed. Locally, the Women's Federation head and the party
secretary are responsible for ensuring the quotas are met. For every
baby over the quota they are docked between five and 10% of their
salary.''
This means that, if she has no permit for a child, even a childless
woman will be given an abortion.
The Dying Rooms features an interview with Steven Mosher, an American
social scientist who completed research in rural China in the early
1980s. Mosher -- who has written widely on the one-child policy --
helped compile A Mother's Ordeal, the autobiography of Chi An, a former
nurse who worked in Chinese population control and now has political
asylum in the United States.
Chi An's book gives a rare insight into Chinese ''family planning''.
Women have IUDs inserted as a matter of course, and are sterilised after
they have a child.
Abortions are routine. Up to five months of pregnancy they are
performed by nurses using suction. From then until as late as nine
months, abortions are induced by doctors.
''The major drawback of this approach,'' writes Chi An, ''was that
these babies were usually born alive. It was upsetting to see a four or
five-pound baby thrown into a trash can still alive.''
An alternative was injecting a powerful herb into the womb --
poisoning the baby and inducing miscarriage. One doctor, writes Chi An,
induced birth and, as the infant's head appeared, injected lethal
formaldehyde into its brain through the fontanel, or soft spot.
The Chinese State employs strict sanctions to enforce its policies.
Those with more than one child face crippling charges for housing and
education.
''Cheating'' can bring severe punishment. Women who become pregnant
without authorisation and refuse abortions may find their water and
electricity cut off. In extreme cases their houses have been pulled
down.
China officially announced last October the execution of Yu Jianan,
former vice-president of a hospital in Hanan province, for issuing false
sterilisation certificates.
The Chinese Government -- which has brushed aside Western concern at
the 1989 killing of students in Tiananmen Square and its repression in
Tibet -- will not be unduly concerned at the outrage The Dying Rooms
will produce here.
The embassy in London has called reports of dying rooms ''vicious
fabrications'' which will ''arouse the indignation of the Chinese
people''. A briefing said this week that ''many orphans have grown up
healthily and made contributions to the country (as) professors,
scientists, army officers and government officials''.
China knows its value to the West. Last month Michael Heseltine,

HAMILTON celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of the Saints and
Sinners charity meeting this evening with prize money of #45,000 on
offer.
It is the richest meeting to be staged at the Lanarkshire course and
has attracted good fields from the main training centres.
The Carlsberg Scottish Hunt Cup, one of two feature races offering
total prize money of #10,000, has attracted 12 runners, four of which
won last time out.
Talented Ting, from Patrick Haslam's stable, a course specialist over
the extended mile, attempts to win this race for the second year
running. The six-year-old, who won over this track nine days ago when he
made all for a three-lengths victory over Esayeffsee, is again partnered
by Jason Weaver.
Allan Mackay rode King Curan with great patience and skill to beat Mr
Rough by a head at Ayr 12 days ago, and Persian Fayre was a convincing
three-lengths winner over Takeshi at the previous meeting in May.
There will be considerable interest for followers of local trainers in
Jim Goldie's Keep Battling, unbeaten in his two runs on the Flat.
Both wins have come at Ayr and the five-year-old will be encountering
Hamilton's steep downhill approach for the first time. He was held up to
quicken inside the last furlong last time, and the same tactics will be
employed again. Another Scottish-trained runner on a possible hat trick
is Donal Nolan's Lord Advocate, who won twice at Hamilton in recent
weeks.
The Wishaw-trained seven-year-old has a stiffer task in this evening's
in the #10,000 Langs Supreme Gold Cup, with proven stayers Latvian,
Mentalasanythin, and Persuasive in the field.
Only four line-up for the opener, the Scottish Equitable Amateur
Riders' Conditions Stakes, possibly because of the presence of Alec
Stewaert's Arab-owned Jandeel, easy winner of a recent maiden race at
Newcastle.

DAVID Campese, the Australian wing wizard and arguably one of the most
exciting players the rugby world has seen, looks a forlorn, solitary,
and sometimes lonely figure here in cloudy Cape Town after his country's
exit from the tournament at the hands of the English.
He has elected to stay on in the city for a few days along with some
of his team-mates, and his depression is stimulated by the fact that not
only are Australia to play no further role in Rugby World Cup 1995, but
people like him are becoming a rare breed because of rugby's laws.
Rugby followers hold Campese close to their hearts, but those searing
breaks, the comic goose steps that used to fool opponents, the cheek,
the gloriously enviable ability and sheer joy of taking to the rugby
field have all been absent. Instead Campese has dropped the ball, failed
to find touch, and, failed to make ground with ball in hand. And from a
genius too. It has all been so very sad to watch. I caught up with my
hero. He is one of my heroes.
''Yeah it's been bad,'' he admitted at his hotel high above the city.
''I've scored 63 tries in Test rugby, but in this competition I've only
had six passes. Can you imagine that? Six passes.''
Campese is an honest man, and like many a great sportsman what he does
best is plying his magical trade on the rugby field. He is a shy man,
perhaps lacking the off-pitch self belief that some, like Will Carling,
have in abundance.
Campese hates to talk for long. Instead he looks on the world with
innocent, sportsman's eyes, as if defying you to find fault. He doesn't
have a mesmeric presence. He believes passionately in rugby as a game.
People sometimes forget that he means it when he says that he doesn't
''. . . give a damn about the money in rugby.'' and that ''. . . the
money has just made the game less enjoyable.
''The major problem that rugby has now is that the laws are all wrong.
The laws are at fault,'' he says. ''You hardly ever see the defending
forwards committing themselves to rucks and mauls, and so if I am in a
back division, then all I see are forwards hanging off ready to
tackle.''
That, of course, means that the space required by someone of Campese's
skills is simply not there. A Jonah Lomu, all 19st and bulging thighs of
him, can choose to crash through, round, or over the hapless defenders
who have elected to fringe, but it is no use at all to David Campese. He
uses guile and speed.
''What has now become a thing of the past in top-level competition is
a well-timed back move,'' he said, as if looking back on a golden era
now gone forever. ''For instance, just how many times did Jeremy Guscott
touch the ball against us from English possession. I don't think he did
at all. No-one is taking risks in rugby because handling risks mean that
you might lose the ball. The English scored when we dropped the ball
trying to handle.''
It would be all to easy to say that the Aussies have been bitter in
defeat as Bob Dwyer, too, has openly criticised England's style of play,
but they would lay claim to having the higher ground in a moral sense
when they say that they want to see rugby as a game of spectacular
movement and excitement. Their match against England was exciting, what
they say is that it was not open, and, so, at odds with their way of
thinking.
Campese says that the answer is simple. ''The International Board
should immediately do two things if we are to get more open play,'' he
says. ''The law makers should go back to the old ruck-and-maul laws
where if you were going forward, you kept it when it stopped. That made
defences compete and get into those tight situations. The law has to be
changed back.''
His coach, Bob Dwyer, has already said publicly that his view on the
latest change to the ruck-and-maul law was ''. . . if it ain't broke
then don't fix it . . .'' and so he agrees with his rebellious winger.
Campese, though, goes further. ''What also has to be done is that the
back row have to be kept bound at scrums until the ball is out. That way
there is room in the backs.''
He has a point. Good sides in the World Cup have been tested in trying
to break down good defences, and what we have seen is a new breed of
''super-youngster,'' like Lomu or Brian Lima, or even another Aussie,
Joe Roff, who are backs that can run over tacklers as a means of
breaking down defences.
No wonder Campese has hinted at retirement.
He knows that he can't compete with the modern, techno thugs when it
comes to bashing up the pitch, but he has always been one of those
blessings to world rugby when he has the ball in his hands and he
deserves a hearing. His suggestions, in actual fact, have been tried out
by Allan Hosie and the SRU boys, and they sound like common sense.
Does he think that it will happen. ''No, I don't think so,'' he says.
''But we have to change the laws or else there is less room for people
like me. That's just the way it is.''
And if that's the way it is then we will have seen the last of the
great man, which I find almost unbelievable having first seen his heels
going further and further away from me at Murrayfield in 1984.
It is so unsatisfactory seeing a great man, possibly past his peak, so
uneasy with his own play and yet impassive on the pitch. I wonder if he
will retire. I hope not. I wonder if the powers at be will listen to
him. I hope so.

NEIL Menzies, coach of the Scottish women's team, will depart from his
policy of giving keepers Tracey Robb and Sue Lawrie equal pitch time
when Scotland open their programme tomorrow in the European Nations' Cup
in Amsterdam.
''I do not think it's fair on the individuals or team to go into a
major championship without having a first-choice keeper,'' said Menzies.
However, he was not forthcoming on who the first choice is but the fact
that Robb has had another fine domestic season could give her the edge.
Menzies' target is ''to improve on our fifth place four years ago,''
but he sees ''Holland and Spain as the chief threats to a semi-final
spot.''
The Dutch are no longer the power they once were but now that they are
under the management of Tommy Van t'Hek, that may change.
The second group is weaker with Germany and England unlikely to
encounter any serious problems on their way to the semi-finals. Today's
games:
Group A: Ireland v Italy, England v Belgium, Germany v France. Group
B: Sweden v Holland.

Stephen McGinty reports that six months after the floods which ruined
their homes, many Paisley families are still struggling to put their
lives back together, and a concert supported by top Scottish
personalities aims to help them
I came home crying my eyes out for the simple reason I couldn't
believe this was happening in 1995. TERRY NEASON
THE WATERS returned to Stockholm Crescent six months after the
December floods swept through Paisley and drove hundreds out through the
livingroom windows. The drama this time was not natural, but man-made.
Workers repairing the damaged homes on one block connected up
de-humidifiers but didn't put down a bucket to catch water from the
waste pipe. The next morning electricians discovered the flooded floor.
So the repair work continues. But not on the next block. At the house
of George Robertson the livingroom remains a rib-cage of beams hanging
over the earthen floor a few feet below. Outside there may not be a
storm cloud in sight, just the warmth of the sun, but inside it's not
looking too bright.
The house is skeletal: walls are black and stripped, wiring hangs out.
The only remnant of an expensive fitted kitchen is a few plumbing pipes,
peeping like periscopes from the floor. A dark stain runs along
wallpaper at the first stair landing, proof of how high the waters rose
in December, 1994.
But George Robertson is lucky. Not because he bought his house, or
that he is self-employed, but when the waters struck he remained afloat,
clutching his insurance policy. It was a life-raft without which others
are sinking. And although George, and Sharon, his wife, have been
bobbing along past three temporary residences, organised by the
insurance company, he continues to hold out his hand to others less
fortunate than themselves.
In his desolate house, rolled and wrapped carpets lie across the floor
beams -- a gift for a young single mum with no insurance, panicking at
the prospect of moving back into an empty house.
The Southend Flood Action Committee is located at 85 Neilston Road,
Paisley, in a few rooms with a word-processor and photocopier. Here
George and Sharon work alongside Fiona and Joe Meikle, helping people to
fill out fund forms and organise what essentials they can. It was also
here that the singer and actress Terry Neason was moved to tears.
Though a benefit concert planned by Mayfest director Paul Barret
failed to take flight, Neason agreed to hold a collection during her
King's Theatre run of concerts and is now getting the previous plan off
the ground. A concert to aid the flood victims will take place at the
King's Theatre on Sunday, June 25.
Not one to take on charitable responsibilities lightly, she decided to
look at what the funds would be used for.
''I won't take on a cause and talk about something I don't know. So I
did the old journalistic trick of taking a tape-recorder and going out
to meet these people; and I was gutted; I was in bits; I cried because I
was depressed; I felt useless, like a theatrical tosser.
''I came home crying my eyes out for the simple reason I couldn't
believe this was happening in 1995. A lot of these people lost
everything; not just damp carpets -- we are talking about furniture all
wiped out. Also the stress and depression of trying to cope when your
home has been washed out.''
Watching the people of Paisley wander the aisles of the King's Theatre
collecting in buckets has strengthened her resolve to help. ''I knew how
difficult it was for them collecting. It was like begging.
''It's not like people collecting for Oxfam. People standing there
with a bucket -- I can't imagine them feeling worse than that. This must
have been the hardest thing in the world for them. 'Give me money --
because I can't go on without it.' That takes a lot of swallowed
pride.''
It's true. The flood victims of Paisley are still looking for money.
Six months after torrential rain flooded the culverts of the Espedair
Burn, sending millions of gallons of rain water through the housing
schemes of Ferguslie Park and Southend, the clean-up continues.
George Robertson explains why. ''The reason we are trying to raise
money is for the people who do not qualify for the Strathclyde Region
Hardship Fund or the district council's Provost Fund. We have at least
20 people who have qualified for only the minimum sum of about #400. And
they do not have any insurance.
''That is why we are trying to collect as much as possible to get them
some money to set up again. A lot of people think it is all settled,
that we have been well looked after. The attitude which is growing is:
'Are you still looking for money?' ''
But this time it's in exchange for tickets. What began as a trickle
into the buckets at Terry Neason's concert will hopefully be converted
into a tidal wave of financial support when Scotland's leading
theatrical lights perform at the concert.
At the King's Mr and Mrs Glasgow will be joined by Mr Govan to help
the Paisley people as Andy Cameron, Dorothy Paul and Gregor Fisher as
Rab C Nesbit join forces. Also among the artistic troops will be Fred
MacAuley, Bruce Morton and Michael Marra, while more names are expected
to be confirmed as the night approaches.
Terry Neason has taken on more than the organisation of the project.
The money raised will be distributed evenly between the flood victims in
Ferguslie Park and Southend.
The sum of #215,000 has been distributed through Renfrew District
Council's Provost Fund, and more than #600,000 from the hardship fund
which was administered through Strathclyde Regional Council.
But local people in both areas believe more money will be needed when
the washed-out residents return -- which the council insists will begin
this month and continue until Christmas. Repairs have been staggered to
take account of modernisation plans.
Tommy McEwan has received about #600 from the funds. However, it is
only a drip into his bucket of debt. As he is uninsured he has spent
#1800 replacing kitchen equipment and furniture. He and his family
remain the last flood victims to be relocated from the natural basin of
Stockholm Crescent. A choice he made himself.
''I'm proud; I don't like begging. I'm lucky, I work. It's going to
take me years to pay this debt off. But it's much worse for those who
are unemployed. The money from the fund is just not enough.''
Back at number 43, George Robertson is exasperated, but is still
outlining his dreams. ''If only I could win the lottery jackpot, I could
take care of everyone -- it would not be a problem.'' Terry Neason
believes if the public forgets the lottery and buys a theatre ticket
instead, everyone could come out a winner.
* Tickets for the charity concert are available at the King's Theatre
Box Office: 0141 227 5511, priced #10 and #5.

Ross Finlay gives the special-edition Calibra a grilling
THE main attraction of the Vauxhall Calibra, apart from the good looks
which have been enhanced by the latest V-grille front end, is that it is
one of the biggest coupes in terms of passenger cabin size. Even so,
there is a limit to the amount of space you can reasonably expect to
find in a car with a coupe-style roofline. Although rear legroom is no
problem, I would say that something like 5ft 8ins is about the height
limit for anybody sitting comfortably there.
While Vauxhall races Cavaliers in the British Touring Car
Championship, Opel runs highly modified Calibras in the DTM, the
freer-formula German equivalent. The special-edition Calibra DTM now on
sale here has lowered suspension, alloy wheels, fatter tyres, extra
interior equipment and a suitably garish colour scheme. But do not
expect anything like the rip-snorting performance of the race cars,
which rev to 11,000rpm and pour out 420bhp.
Like most major manufacturers, Vauxhall produces its coupes on a
saloon base. Effectively a rebodied Cavalier, the Calibra therefore has
a familiar saloon-style front cabin and fascia, similar seating, and a
handling/ride package which owes more to its modified saloon antecedents
than to a full sporting approach. Critics of cars like this, who feel
they should be more like sports cars with roofs, entirely miss the
point.
The Calibra comes with a choice of engines: a two-litre unit in either
eight-valve or 16-valve form, the Ellesmere Port-built V6, or a
turbocharged version of the two-litre job, which punches out 204bhp.
That one is available only with four-wheel drive, in an effort to make
it less unruly than the same power output would be when directed through
the front wheels only.
On a recent drive to Dublin, I was fortunate enough to be in a V6
Calibra, the model which, for smoothly delivered performance and easy
cruising, is the pick of the bunch. This car comes with cloth upholstery
at #19,950 or with smart leather seating at #20,800.
Although the Calibra may be a familiar sight on the roads now, its
appearance -- especially in the fine-looking 1995 style -- still turns
heads. There is a revised interior package too, which includes white, or
light grey-faced dials.
Drivers may take a while to get used to what seem more like style
features than essential changes here, but the night-time illumination of
the instruments is very effective.
Twin airbags are standard on the V6, which also comes with very good
anti-lock brakes linked to a traction control system, as well as
Vauxhall's highly regarded deadlocks, immobiliser and ultrasonic alarm.
One thing which is still irritating is the failure to provide steering
column height adjustment on airbag-equipped cars.
Peaking at 170bhp, the 2498cc V6 engine accelerates what is not a
lightweight car to 60mph in about 7.5 seconds, will take it on to a test
track maximum around 145mph, and performs throughout its rev range with
smoothness, good response and an element of dash. There is no impression
of engine strain, and when cruising leisurely the V6 will return fuel
consumption figures like 42mpg at 56mph and 34 at 75, compared with
24mpg around town.
Just as with the way in which the Corsa developed into the Tigra, the
Cavalier's rear suspension has been completely changed for the Calibra.
Vauxhall engineers accept that a coupe will generally carry a lighter
load than a saloon. The result is that the Calibra feels easier on lumpy
surfaces, and, when pressed on hard along winding roads, is more able to
cope with the performance the V6 engine offers. Its general high-speed
handling still inclines more to the modified saloon than to the sports
car side of the spectrum, and the steering response, while sharpened up
last year, is a little mushier than it would be if this were a
full-blown sports car.
That, it is not. But the V6 Calibra is an elegant, fast, secure and
comfortable coupe -- Vauxhall's grand tourer.

Not everyone's a super athlete - but at least you can look the part,
says Francesca Fearon, as the season for sporting fast-track fashion
gets into top gear
THERE is no need to break sweat to keep astride of fashion's favourite
theme this season. Polo tournaments, regattas, athletic meetings, the
rugby World Cup and, of course, Wimbledon in 12 days' time,
energetically swell the summer calendar.
But, perhaps, the biggest sporting event this season is happening out
on the street. The nation's passion for sport has spilled out of the
court, off the track and on to the catwalk as a major influence for
designers and upbeat fashion brands. Now it is pumping up the action on
the pavements and in the clubs.
In recent seasons designers have made a habit of raiding the
locker-room, purloining tennis togs, preppy polo shirts, athletic
shorts, and baseball caps. Even the sleak aerodynamic bodywear of
surfers, skaters, and bladers has not escaped their thrall.
The fusion of fitness and fashion is nothing new, but maybe the
super-athletic look just has more of a rock 'n' roll attitude about it
nowadays. The nightclubs are full of girls showing off their well-toned
bodies with some fast-track dressing. The briefest running shorts or
little white tennis dresses are teamed with heeled canvas high-top
trainers.
Meanwhile, the guys are swaggering like their heroes in designer
football shirts, muscle-back tank-tops and branded sweats. It is hardly
surprising you can't get a more intensive workout than twisting,
bumping, and grinding on the dance-floor.
The big sportswear brands have also cottoned on to the fact that with
the right fabrics and careful styling they are earning street
credibility. So now active sportswear is jumping the fine line between
function and fashion. High performance names like Converse, Russell
Athletic, Nike, and Adidas are as likely to be seen in the beam of a
flashing strobe as their designer counterparts, their clubland
respectability soaring on the simple fact they are cool, comfortable,
and they look modern.
This locker-room heist was a shrewd move by designers who have come to
realise that success rests in delivering sportswear looks to the young
style-conscious. Ralph Lauren identified the trend in the US and opened
a big sports emporium on Maddison Avenue in late 1993. Now Polo Sport is
sprinting across the Atlantic, with DKNY Athletic in its shadow,
perpetuating the American designer link with sportswear which originated
with Claire McCardell in the 1940s.
The baseball cap left the pitch years ago, adopted by fans before
filtering into the fashion arena. The comfort of fleecy sweatshirts and
pants couldn't be ignored for long; a splash of colour and they have
become staple of brands like Benetton. The polo shirt, now synonymous
with Ralph Lauren rather than the thoroughbred sport, features in
several designer collections for summer.
Bella Freud and Nicholas Knightsly translated its idiosyncratic
neckline in knitted and jersey fabrics. Gucci used it for bright-red
cashmere twinsets, Prada coloured it navy and Katharine Hamnett dressed
her rock chicks in them, and gave sweatbands the tiara treatment.
Not surprisingly, it has been adopted by the design-led high street
retailers. Kookai has knitted skinny polo shirts, French Connection has
lengthened the polo into dresses, and Warehouse has dyed skimpy stretch
aertex versions in bright colours for the competitively priced
Definitive range. But despite the efforts of counterfeiters, the classic
Lacoste label still has kudos.
With Wimbledon only days away, the tennis dress and little pleated
skirt have come under scrutiny. DKNY, Next, Etam and Warehouse serve
crisp cotton and linen styles that look modern and stay cool in the
hottest situations. All that's needed are the frilly knickers.
Other designers hark back to the more graceful era of tennis with
cotton tennis sweaters and long white pleated skirts. Versace certainly
played with the elegant retro image in his summer advertising campaign
-- the only thing missing was the tennis racket.
However, not to be out-played on their own territory, Wimbledon Tennis
Championships have been branded with a range of polo shirts, sweats,
T-shirts and shorts in the tournament strip (purple, navy and green),
brandishing the famous racket logo. Great for the enthusiast, but
perhaps a trifle too literal for the streetwise.

ONLY in Brazil would there have been disquiet about the manner in
which the national team won the last World Cup, their fourth in all. The
nation rejoiced, but when the samba drums stopped the public inquest
began and the manager, Carlos Alberto Parreira, stood accused of having
been too defensively minded.
That was it. Parreira was guilty of one of the most heinous crimes in
all Brazil and had to go. In fact, he left the country and became
manager of Valencia in Spain, but they sacked him only two weeks ago.
The ''torcida'' -- the fans of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and all
other parts of Brazil -- offered him no sympathy. They saw his dismissal
as justice taking its course.
All manner of inhumanities must be tolerated by the people of Brazil,
who live mostly in poverty and with disease and corruption, but they
will not accept defensive football. They are demanding a return to the
traditional values which Brazil produced in winning the Umbro Cup in
England last week.
Under Mario Zagalo, a small, animated 63-year-old, Brazil have
embarked on a programme designed to rediscover the faith, and slowly he
is winning over the public, who were sceptical of him because of his
relationship with Parreira.
Zagalo was an adviser to Parreira during the last World Cup and people
were concerned that nothing would change, but the veteran, who was a
World Cup winner twice as a player (1958 and 1962), once as head coach
(1970), and once as assistant (1994), is staying true to his pledge to
play football. Already he has won over Pele.
''I look at the team now and I see many young players who have the
desire to play and perform,'' said Pele. ''They want to express
themselves and be free of any defensive systems.
''I watched them play England last week and they showed us all that
Zagalo, too, wants to see them play the way Brazil should always play,
with movement, skill, rhythm and a variety of speed.''
The warm hug Pele gave Zagalo at the end of the 3-1 win against
England at Wembley was a sign to the Brazilian people. It was
confirmation Brazil are ready again to use their footballing riches
properly.
The game as Brazil should always play it had been subdued for just
more than two decades, during which time the South Americans were parted
from the World Cup trophy, and the longer the two remained estranged the
more anxious became the coaches who tried to marry the ways of European
football with their own methods.
The result, while a quality of play with which any other nation on the
planet would have been happy, was an affront to a nation where players
are born with natural rhythm in their souls, and not even a fourth
triumph over the rest of the world failed to appease the masses.
Parreira, they said, was like the others in that he had betrayed his
birthright. Only when Brazil are flowing properly, moving the ball
forward using instinctive, intricate passing movements, can the country
be truly happy. Football really is this important to Brazilians.
Such passion, however, is open to abuse and the country's politicians
are fond of using football in election campaigns. For instance, Eurico
Miranda, vice-president of Vasco da Gam of Rio de Janeiro, ran for
congress about a year ago and it is said that during political
broadcasts on television he rarely spoke of the corruption in high
office which helps perpetuate Brazil's myriad social problems.
Not for him words of comfort about poverty levels. Instead, he
preached to the fans of his club, calling them the Vasco family.
Of course, it is because survival is such a struggle that the people
turn to football and in the same way it used to offer a release to
Britain's downtrodden of yesterday football allows all Brazilians an
escape. Through heroes like Pele, Rivelino, Gerson, Jairzinho, and
Romario they can reach out beyond their misery and soar above the
squalor of their shanty towns.
They can declare themselves to the world. Football is their way of
saying they are here, that they are alive and that they can do this one
thing better than anyone else.
This is the enormity of the responsibility Zagalo carries, and he
said: ''I was always very hurt to be associated with a defensive team. I
am not defensively minded.
''I present my record for everyone to study and it is better than
anyone else's. I am a winner and you cannot win by playing just
defense.''
He believes the nucleus of Brazil's future performed in England last
week, even though Romario, Bebeto, Mazinho and Mauro Silva were
unavailable. They were not missed and of that quartet perhaps only
Romario could command a place in the new team with the old values.
Zagalo believes he has seen the future in Juninho, Edmundo, Roberto
Carlos, and Ronaldo, and he said: ''Our style, which is attractive
again, respects the need to entertain without showing disdain for
efficiency. It is a blend of art and competition which right now is
without equal anywhere.
''The players and tactics have changed since the World Cup, when brute
force was taking the place of talent and ability. No more. We want to
play again.''

THE Scots left everyone in the shade yesterday at sunny Royal Portrush
in the first round of the British Women's Amateur championship with
Mhairi McKay and Janice Moodie snatching the top spots from under the
noses of a class field.
McKay stunned the locals by going out in six under par, an almost
unheard of score for a woman at Portrush, long noted for the tightness
of its fairways and heralded as a true thinking golfer's course.
The 20-year-old, who only returned from America on Saturday, where she
studies at Stanford University, had a tougher time on the back nine,
falling foul of the notorious fourteenth hole, Calamity Corner, and
carding bogeys at the twelfth and sixteenth.
However, a birdie at the last, where she sunk a 30ft putt,
consolidated her spectacular start, which included four birdies and an
eagle at the seventh, where she hit a No.8-iron shot to 30 feet and sank
the putt for a course record 71.
''This course is even tougher than Turnberry,'' laughed McKay, who can
see the Irish coast from her home club. ''You have to think about every
single shot.''
Moodie shot a 72 to share second place with Hazel Kavanagh, a Dublin
girl who plays for Grange.
''I had a great caddie,'' said the Windyhill golfer. ''He is a local
player and seemed to know every blade of grass.''
Kavanagh, who spent the winter playing golf in South Africa, holed a
40ft putt at the last for an eagle. Leading scores:
71 -- M McKay (Turnberry).
72 -- J Moodie (Windyhill), H Kavanagh (Grange).
73 -- A Vincent (France).
74 -- E Power (Kilkenny), T Lipp (Canada), V Requier (France), J Hall
(Felixstowe Ferry).
75 -- M Hjorth (Sweden), K Moutgue D'Algue (France), H Jones
(Strabane).
76 -- E Fields (Falmouth), C Grady (Bawburgh), V Hassett (Ennis), S
Beautell (Spain).
77 -- S Fanagan (Milltown), G Nutter (Prestwich), K Stupples (Royal
Cinque Ports), E Duggleby (Malton and Norton).
78 -- V Melvin (Stirling University), A Berg (Sweden), J Busuttil
(France), M McKenna (Donabate), L Griffin (USA), L Ericsson (Sweden), S
O'Brien Kenney (Grange), I Tinnings (Denmark), C Caldwell (Sunningdale).
Other Scottish scores: 79 -- E Ratcliffe (Stirling University), E
Dickson (St Andrews University), L Nicholson (Haddington). 81 -- C Agnew
(Glasgow University). 83 -- H Stirling (Bridge of Allan).
KEVIN Stables hopes to follow in the footsteps of the legendary Eric
Brown at Nairn this week, when he attempts to become only the second
player ever to win the BBA Northern Open in three successive years.
Brown's trio of successes came in 1953-55, while Stables' wins came
across the town at Nairn Dunbar in 1993 and at Royal Dornoch last year.

TOMMY Craig yesterday delivered a damning verdict on the state of
Scottish football after having watched the next generation of Brazilian
superstars expose the limitations of his Scottish players in the Toulon
Under-21 Tournament.
The Scotland Under-21 coach blamed his fellow managers for not doing
enough to raise standards, insisted the supporters were being
short-changed by being forced to watch unattractive games, and admitted
he was pessimistic about any improvement in the future.
Craig was adamant he was not trying to find an excuse for Scotland's
4-0 mauling in the semi-finals of the French tournament. The assistant
manager at Aberdeen maintained: ''Maybe I am too romantic about the
game, but when Brazil were beating us I thought I was watching a work of
art. Some people will not understand this, but if you love football
enough it can become that.
''I went to two games each week last season and cannot remember a
single game of football in Scotland. Fans are being brainwashed into
thinking that they are getting what they want. This is simply not true.
''The way we play the game makes it practically impossible to compete.
Brazil play real football -- we don't.
''Over the years we have talked about how to make it better. Various
ideas have been put forward, like different leagues, but this is only
going to produce the same type of football with the same lack of
entertainment.
''A lot of work is going on with community officers and seven-a-side
games, but the main body of the professional game in almost every area
is happy if their team is doing well, never mind playing well.
''Our game is at a very low ebb. Each year we charge more from the
supporters for less. In 10 years' time there will be a massive problem
if nothing is done to halt the decline.
''If people within the game do not recognise this fact then they are
blind. It is improving in the Premiership with teams like Manchester
United, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, Spurs and the like, but not
here.''
Craig said he hoped the recently appointed review commission headed by
Ernie Walker would help launch a new era.
Pledging that Aberdeen would follow his football philosophy, he added:
''These comments will not go down well with some people, but they had to
be said. If football is not about enjoyment it is about nothing.''
* ALEX Ferguson yesterday turned down Derby's attempt to land Steve
Bruce as their new player-manager.
Meanwhile, Paul Ince flew out to Milan yesterday, but refused to
comment on reports that he was joining the Inter-Milan. ''I am going on
holiday,'' joked Ince.
* MIDFIELDER Graham Connell, released by Ipswich, has joined
Clydebank.
* CLUBS can name three outfield players as substitutes next season.
Scottish League secretary Peter Donald yesterday confirmed the new
ruling would apply in all league and cup matches.

Farming editor Robert Ross reports on the diverse range of events
which attract the most hardened townies to the Royal Highland Show at
Ingliston.
FARMING editors tend to plough a lone furrow within a newspaper office
-- until some weeks before the Royal Highland Show when an astounding
variety of colleagues declare an interest in agriculture and an urgent
need to attend the show on a complimentary ticket.
This is surely no bad thing and proves that in a small country like
Scotland even the most died-in-the-wool towny is not that far removed
from agricultural roots.
One former colleague, a Glasgow man to the core, was a most unlikely
-- but very faithful -- attender at Highland Shows. He is best
remembered fighting his way through the crowd at Ingliston on a boiling
hot day with a knotted handkerchief on his head. His shirt sleeves were
rolled up and he held one arm before him declaring indignantly: ''I've
just been bitten by a bloody donkey.''
He did not sue but the donkey's owners might have had a case if
alcoholic poisoning had subsequently been diagnosed. It probably wasn't
a donkey anyway. It could have been a Clydesdale or maybe just an
aggressive blackface sheep.
There will be many thousands of folk in the crowds at the show who
will be no better informed than he was -- testimony to the drawing power
of the ''Highland''. From 8am on Thursday June 22 until 5pm on Sunday
June 25 the crowds will flock to Ingliston. The weather will inevitably
have some effect on the final figures but rest assured, the public will
be there in their thousands handing over up to #12 a head for admission
to the ground. From 4pm onwards admission is half price.
The organisers of the modern show are well aware that there is more
than one target audience and the programme reflects that diversity. At
the core, always, is the livestock judging and the opportunity to view
all the latest machinery displayed by major manufacturers.
Livestock entries this year show an increase of 10% over last year's
figure. The beef cattle section has 880 entries -- 101 more than last
year. Leading the field, with 154 animals forward are the Highland
Cattle. Their breed society will be staging their first international
gathering to coincide with the show. Limousins are next with 109.
The heavy horse section is the only one to show a drop from last year
but, despite all the mechanisation on the modern farm, they have an
entry of 360. Light horses have 975 entries (including 18 donkeys).
For those who want to give the sheep and cattle and goats a miss there
will be plenty to see and do. One of the most popular marquees houses
the spectacular flower show sponsored by the Bank of Scotland. It has
now come to be regarded as the Scottish equivalent of the Chelsea Flower
Show. This year there will be 59 exhibitors, 24 of them from Scotland.
Annandale and Eskdale, Inverclyde, and Edinburgh District Councils are
all mounting displays and in addition there will be an oriental garden
designed and constructed by students from Oatridge Agricultural College
at Broxburn, West Lothian.
Many specialist nurseries will be represented on the trade stands
where visitors will be able not only to view but also to purchase top
quality flowers, plants, and shrubs.
The Food from Scotland exhibition is another feature which has almost
taken on a life of its own within the Royal Highland Show. This year's
centrepiece will be ''A Taste of Dumfries and Galloway'' -- the first of
a series designed to show the diversity and distinctiveness of the food
from Scotland's regions.
Finally, there is the McEwan's family Sunday which takes up the
challenge of providing something for everyone with a #17 ticket covering
a family of four. In the main ring at 12 noon and 1.50pm there will be
Roman chariot racing, staged by one of Europe's leading horsemen and
stuntsmen, Gerard Naprous. Other main ring highlights will include
musical rides by the Household Cavalry, skydiving with the Nissan
Skydiving Team, heavy horse turnouts and the Blue Arrows motorcycle
display team.
At 2.45pm the traditionalists will be catered for when a parade of the
cream of Scotland's livestock -- prizewinning cattle, goats, and horses
-- fills the arena.
Throughout the four-day show there will be displays by military and
pipe bands as well as demonstrations of sheep shearing, horse shoeing
and gatemaking.

Architect Susan Weir tells Simon Berry how a West End gap site
inspired her to design a terrace house for the 21st century.
LIKE other Victorian cities, Glasgow has no shortage of terrace
houses, but unlike the brick-built rows of back-to-backs, familiar from
Coronation Street, living in a Glaswegian terrace was a mark of upward
mobility - definitely out of the tenement environment but not yet in
sufficient funds for a villa.
That said, the average terrace house does not always suit late
twentieth-century living requirements. The deep rooms (dicated by the
condensed frontage of each unit in the terrace) can be ill-lit, the
small floor plans mean rooms are split up arbitrarily with kitchen and
dining room pehaps on different floors, and then there are all those
stairs . . .
Thoughts such as these may have been going through the fertile mind of
Susan Weir, an architect who joined Glasgow practice SBT Keppie after
qualifying just over a year ago. She had been looking at flats and
noticed that a number of teraces in Glasgow's West End had gap sites,
some of long standing. This seemed a strange situation when the area was
clearly much in demand from those who appreciate the amenities of the
inner city.
''In many cases the planners insist that a replacement building is a
faithful copy of what was there before, a pastiche if you like,'' says
Keppie's chairman Peter Scott, who was intrigued by Susan's idea of
designing a terrace house for the way we live now.
''In other parts of Europe you will find that architects are more
skilled in providing a contemporary architecture for infill sites. Here
it's seen as anti-conservation.''
So what are the main features of this modernist terrace house that
distinguish it from its forebears? The street elevation, which will need
to match its neighbours fairly closely, gives few clues, except for a
curved mansard roof which could possibly take dormer windows. But the
back (south-facing) elevation is from a different world, taking every
advantage of direct sunlight.
''I envisaged a house where there would be space on the top floor for
home working and at the lowest level a games room for the children,''
explains Susan. ''The two floors of principal rooms are linked by a
glazed stairwell which introduces light into the heart of the building
and transforms the interior space, providing more of a link with the
garden area.''
Certainly the rear elevation, dominated by the metal roofed stair
tower and a two-storey conservatory, is excitingly different. Susan sees
it finished mainly in white-painted render with non-reflective glass.
This unashamedly exposed approach is re-emphasised by several solar
panels on the small sloping roof area.
The conservatory, with its appealing first floor ''perch'' study area,
has also been designed to work as a ''passive solar'' space that will
help to reduce heating bills.
The total floor area is some 2500sq ft, giving a projected
construction cost of #155,000-#160,000. For this you get two large
north-facing bedrooms, a living room with rear lighting from the
conservatory, a dining room and a huge 30ft roof space which could be
subdivided to provide a guest room. According to Susan, this compares
favourably with what the same money would buy on a greenfield estate.
''I see this as a challenge to provide a more attractive alternative
to the neo-Georgian box that most builders offer. I don't think most
people would be worried by the look of my design; in fact to my eye it
is quite traditional and uses well-established Scottish building
materials.''
Susan Weir, born in Ireland, studied at the Mackintosh School of
Architecture. She already has an impressive array of projects, including
the conversion of the CRM ''tower'' in Mitchell Lane into an
architecture centre and a new office building just completing in St
Vincent Street. She has also done some conversions and extensions of
older houses.
Currently she is working on a shortlisted design for the new Glasgow
University Business School extension. Susan hopes that the demand for
architect-designed homes may increase with the emergence of a new breed
of young professionals who are not over-awed by professional mystique.

THERE is a round sticker which depicts a medieval craftsman wielding a
mallet and chisel.
And this emblem is adorning the windows, vehicles and appearing on the
stationery of firms across the Britain.
For them, and more important, for their customers, it is a symbol of
excellence, a mark of distinction and prestige. And it is not reserved
for the country's top companies.
It also distinguishes the workshops of one-man joinery businesses, a
small foundry in East Kilbride, a roofing company, a plumbing company,
an Aberdeen fashion boutique, a restaurant or two and a specialist
furniture maker in Auchterarder.
It is the logo of the Guild of Master Craftsmen, a nationwide
organisation of individuals and companies who take a conscious pride in
the quality of their workmanship or service to their customers. And it
is exclusive. Members are subject to random and regular assessments of
their skills, their services and their products. Fail and there is no
recourse. Defaulters are expelled.
In Scotland 6000 firms and individuals are members of the guild and
about 30,000 nationwide.
It was started more than 20 years ago by a man called Alan Phillips
who is now secretary and a member of the council of management of the
guild.
''He became fed up with the 'that'll do' attitude that was creeping
into British workmanship. He wanted the best,'' said Ken Anderson, the
guild's general manager in Scotland.
The guild was created based on the ancient ''frith'' or craft guilds
which were associations of masters and men in the same trade, and it has
expanded and grown into one of the most respected organisations in the
country.
There are many benefits, aims and objectives listed in the guild
brochures, but the real purpose of the guild is the search for and the
maintenance of quality. For members and for their clients and customers
only the best will do.
''It works both ways,'' said Ken Anderson at his home and office in
the Fife village of Newmills. ''It also weeds out the ''cowboy'' factor.
We get firms who want the prestige and the status of having membership
but don't come up to our standards. In recent years as many as 300 firms
and individuals have been expelled for not coming up to scratch. But we
must be getting better because it was only about 100 expulsions last
year.''
Glasgow regional manager, Gerry Gray has a background of management in
a major health board in charge of a large staff. His counterpart in
Aberdeen and the north-east, Sandy Adamson, is a qualified engineer.
Working with them as assessors are a senior ex-Army officer,
architecturally qualified men, a geologist, men of experience in
business and craftsmanship.
The guild logo is one of the best guarantees a customer can have if
they are employing a tradesman, a specialist firm or using a shop,
service hotel or restaurant which has been granted membership.
From its national headquarters in Lewes in Sussex members can ask for
advice on how to promote their businesses. There is advice on marketing,
free credit checks on customers and a low-cost debt collection service.
And now the guild has established its own insurance scheme for members.
Firms or individuals in Scotland who are interested in the guild
should first contact Ken's regional managers. Gerry Gray, whose area is
Glasgow and West of Scotland, can be contacted by telephone on 01505
850468. Sandy Adamson who operates for the north and Aberdeen can be
reached on 01779 812496.

ENGLAND'S Tony Underwood knows how big a task he will have when Jonah
Lomu rumbles towards him in Cape Town on Sunday.
Lomu, the 6ft 5in, 19st All Black, has thundered on to the World Cup
stage to gasps of wonder and astonishment, and now it is Underwood's
turn to try and halt the big fellow in his tracks.
Easy to say from 6000 miles away, not so easy to achieve from six
feet, as even Lomu's New Zealand team-mate Mike Brewer admitted.
The back-row man prides himself on his tackling ability. But even he
found Lomu too hot to handle when they came up against each other back
home.
''He came straight for me, I set myself and I really thought I was
going to get him,'' said the Otago flanker. ''But at the end all I could
do was to hang on to one leg as he kept going. He's just quite awesome,
almost impossible to stop, and because he's such a big bloke it's very
difficult to get your hands round him.''
The question now is whether Will Carling's side can handle ''The
Whale.'' The English are hoping that Jonah might be the one swallowed up
at the end of 80 minutes.

* RUGBY World Cup's disputes committee have cut the dirty play
suspension on Western Samoan Mike Umaga from 90 days to 60.
Umaga, cited by tournament officials after his country's defeat by
South Africa, was originally suspended for 90 days for a dangerous
tackle on his South African counterpart Andre Joubert.
The disciplinary commitee said it also had taken into account a
pre-tournament head-butting by Umaga.
The disputes committee reduced the sentence by 30 days after an appeal
by Western Samoa, who said the head-butting should not have figured in
the decision.
Umaga was not cautioned for the tackle on Joubert, because Scottish
referee Jim Fleming did not see it. But Fleming warned Umaga for another
dangerous tackle on South African scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen.
He was the seventh player suspended during the tournament as
authorities clamped down on foul play.

A FINE performance from Wasim Akram helped Lancashire reach the Benson
&amp; Hedges Cup final. The Pakistani player turned almost certain defeat
into victory by crashing 64 runs off 47 balls as Worcestershire were
beaten by two wickets with four deliveries to spare at New Road.
''I've not been batting well,'' said Akram. ''It's just been block,
block, block. I said to myself on the way here that this time I would
just play my own game.''
Akram and Warren Hegg (31no) added 69 in just six overs for the eighth
wicket. And when Akram was bowled by Phil Newport, Hegg and Gary Yates
did the rest with an unbeaten 26-run stand.
Captain Mike Watkinson admitted: ''I suppose it looked all over when
we were six down, but you never give up hope because we bat so deep. We
are never dead and buried. It was a remarkable game and Wasim is an
exceptional performer.''
Worcestershire looked odds-on for another trip to Lord's after Graeme
Hick had scored 109 and then helped to reduce Lancashire to 135 for six
with two wickets.
''I suppose it was a case of snatching defeat from the jaws of
victory,'' said coach, David Houghton. ''But all credit to them. Wasim
is the sort of player who can turn any game.''
In the other semi-final, Mark Ealham gave Kent a fine chance of
reaching a record seventh final. His maiden half-century in the 55-over
competition lifted Kent to 250 for nine against Somerset at Canterbury,
after the men from the West Country had threated to restrict their
opponents to a less demanding target.
After Kent failed to master the damp conditions and the craft of
Pakistan leg spinner Mushtaq Ahmed, Ealham showed his liking for this
code of cricket. He faced only 61 balls for his 52, which contained two
sixes.
If Kent bowl to their potential, Ealham could well follow in the
footsteps of his father and former Kent captain Alan and appear in the
Benson's showpiece at Lord's on July 15.
In fact, Ealham senior's winning of this trophy in 1978 -- plus the
county championship -- was Kent's last major title and since then have
been very much the nearly men.
At Canterbury -- Kent 250-9 (M Ealham 52) v Somerset. Bad light
stopped play.
At Worcester -- Worcestershire 261-5 (G Hick 109, T Moody 75 no).
Lancashire 264-8 (Wasim Akram 64) Lancashire won by two wickets.

CONSTRUCTION began yesterday on an 18-hole championship course
situated around Sunlaws House Hotel, three miles south of Kelso.
The course, designed by former Ryder Cup player Dave Thomas, is to be
built on land owned by the Duke of Roxburghe and will be alled the
Duke's Course, Sunlaws.
The course is scheduled to be opened for play in the spring of 1997
with some limited play by invitation during 1996.

TENNIS is in decline, regardless of anything the Association of
Tournament Professionals, the Women's Tennis Association or any of the
Grand Slam organisers may say. Do not listen to them. Trust your own
vision. Read a T-shirt.
A young boy travelling the London underground the other day wore a
T-shirt which declared boldly: Tennis sucks.
More than that, the child got off the tube at Southfields, the
District Line stop which services the All England Lawn Tennis and
Croquet Club grounds which host the Wimbledon championships. If the
youngster returns on Monday week wearing the same top he is liable to be
dragged off to the Tower, where he will go without sweets for the
duration of the tournament. If he doesn't repent he might be made to
watch Pete Sampras videos.
Rubbishing tennis is next door to treason in Wimbledon's leafy
suburbs, which become the centre of the sporting universe for two weeks
spanning June and July every year, but the boy was making a point about
modern tennis, and it was damn difficult to argue. If you look you will
see standards are dropping as players appear younger, yet more powerful,
every year.
Someone must have left the doors to the world's playschool open, and
the circuit, which for many years was ruled by genuine talents like
King, Evert, Navratilova, Goolagong, Borg, Connors, McEnroe, Lendl and
Becker has been overrun by little people wielding big rackets. Power and
fitness, as we have witnessed from the world of Scottish football, do
not necessarily mean better quality. Yet, to the mighty in tennis will
go most of the glory.
Graft rather than craft has become the norm in the modern sporting
world. It has always been easier to bludgeon an opponent into submission
than to defeat him or her by guile and genius, and tennis players have
not been slow to recognise this truth, or, more correctly, their parents
were quick to spot a good thing.
Behind every one of those kids from Hell stands a mum or dad with
dollar signs in their eyes and a Rolex on a wrist. They realised tennis,
which reached what was perhaps a false zenith in the 70s through the
80s, when so many extremely talented and larger than life characters
were performing, was the sport into which to toss junior and make a few
bucks.
Gradually the new, but one-dimensional, adolescents who could wrap two
hands around a racket and bop the ball with any ferocity at all
outnumbered the real players, who were no longer able to run away from
the debilitating effects of growing old.
The disintegration of Eastern European unions saw a flood of players
whose names end in the same three letters: Habsudova, Manikova,
Makarova, Richterova, Studenikova, and Smashnova (honest, her first name
is Anna and she comes from Minsk). There are more to come and many will
earn riches beyond their wildest dreams.
They are welcomed into a jet-set world of limousines, top hotels and
weighty cheques, yet few of them can actually play a game of tennis
which would require thought and patience. They are mostly mediocre
players who employ strong-arm tactics to get what they want.
Tennis, as a consequence of the proliferation of young, hungry,
grunting players, is on the brink of becoming stupifying. There are more
stops than ever on the tour, but nothing much changes from town to town:
service . . . return . . . volley . . . point Miss Beltitova.
The men's circuit is not much better, and tennis, which used to have
the highest profile of any sport, suddenly has a serious image problem.
Television is switching off and sponsors are not falling over themselves
in the same numbers to sign up the latest prodigy.
Today's players lack the charisma of those they have replaced --
Thomas ''I'm not very interesting'' Muster has just won the French Open
-- and rarely feature on sports bulletins, never mind newscasts. Time
was when tennis players were big news.
When the sport became open it assumed a sexy, vibrant movie-star image
and people wanted to see these superstars and know all about them.
Once we had Borg and Connors, now we have Sampras and Courier; where
there once was McEnroe, there is Bruguera; for Lendl there is
Kafelnikov, who has become known as Kalashnikov, a handle which sums up
the state of a sport which grows ever weaker because of the power in the
arms of the players.
It would be wrong to think that all the unknowns who are earning good
money from tennis have only recently surfaced, because their kind were
always scuffling around, but only on the fringes of the real action. It
was just that everyone's attention was locked into the show courts where
the big-timers could always be found.
However, while Steffi Graf, who won her fourth French Open title on
Sunday, is holding back the pretenders, even she, superb player that she
is, lacks charisma and, like it or not, that is a drawback in the eyes
of the corporate spenders. At the risk of offending, it has to be said
tennis needs glamour if it is to continue to attract major sponsors.
It also requires exciting rivalry, which is why Monica Seles, who has
not played competitively since she was stabbed in the back by a deranged
Graf fan two years ago, is being pressed to return.
She may play against Martina Navratilova in a match arranged for the
benefit of CBS television in America, and that a TV company wants to
show pictures of her return in a challenge match against a woman who has
retired from the top level while competitive tournaments are being
ignored says much about the sport's condition.
Something will have to be done if tennis is to remain one of the
world's most popular spectator sports, and Wimbledon are to play their
part in trying to make play more attractive. This year they will use
balls which travel at slightly slower speeds, and the fact Wimbledon
have acknowledged the need to curb power players is significant. All
they have to do now is provide the players with personalities.
No doubt the ladies and gentlemen of Wimbledon will be relieved their
sport has dropped off the news pages, but tennis will continue to
decline without a high level of media interest. It was a nuisance at
times when the news hacks swarmed into interview rooms asking personal
questions of Connors and Evert, Navratilova and various lady friends,
McEnroe and his rages, Lendl and his young girlfriend, and Boris's
sexual appetite.
Whether we liked it or not the 'Mad Mac' and 'Bonking Boris' headlines
helped promote the sport and they increased awareness in players who
were given Hollywood lifestyles.
In an ideal world the flow into the game of characters with popular
appeal would have been controlled, but tennis had too many pretty
marvellous things at the same time and now, after a couple of decades,
the good times are over. Well, almost.
The old fellahs, led by Connors, who has instigated his own seniors'
tour, are back and worrying the establishment, because Connors' crew
still have more appeal than the new kids. All the old sluggers like Borg
and Wilander are with him, and he has a few desperadoes in tow, too.
McEnroe, Newcombe and Nastase are playing.
Lendl wants to join, too, but so far Connors, who always said the
Czech who took American citizenship had no personality when he was at
the height of his powers, is asking what can he possibly offer now?
Connors always did like to tease Lendl and he'll let him in. After all
these years Lendl, the game's Prince of Darkness, remains good box
office.
Although he was always a bit remote and private Lendl realised the
value of the McEnroes and the Connors. ''I don't think the sport will
recover until there is another American superstar like McEnroe or
Connors,'' the PoD has said.
The women also have their legends tour in which Goolagong, King,
Navratilova and Evert, who has been critical of the women's tour, play.
Given the choice between any of the above or Amy Frazier, Iva Majoli,
Naoko Sawamasu, the dreadfully bland Wayne Ferreira, Richard Krajicek or
Todd Martin, who would you pay to watch?

STELLA ARTOIS TENNIS
MARK Petchey brought Britain's new role model down to earth with a
bump at London's Queen's Club yesterday.
Petchey complained when Montreal-born Greg Rusedski blocked his path
to the British No.1 slot after having switched allegiance from Canada.
But Petchey put Rusedski in his place, beating the big-hitter 6-4, 1-6,
6-3 on his debut under a Great Britain flag.
''I wanted to prove a point not only to everyone here but also to
myself,'' said Petchey. ''You can't say what I said and then fall flat
on your face. There was so much riding on this match from a personal
point. I just disapproved of the whole issue of Greg coming here.
''I put in a lot towards reaching No.1, then the goalposts were moved.
Fortunately, I never considered throwing my rackets away and getting a
stockbroking job.''
That would have been a loss to British tennis, judging by Petchey's
hyped-up performance. His display looked more convincing than Rusedski's
except when the world No.54 hit a perfect serving rhythm in the second
set.
''Greg wanted to make a good impression but I didn't let him and I'm
glad,'' added Petchey, ranked No.3 in Britain and 114 on the world list.
''I wanted to win. Now I have beaten Greg I feel I can still make No
1.''
Petchey insists he and Rusedski are the best of friends off court. But
their rivalry on it will provide a boost for British tennis.
There never was a hint of bad blood between them as Petchey twice
inquired after Rusedski's health when the 6ft 3in player crashed onto
the turf that had sweated under covers.
Rusedski, in a blue and white headband, munched bananas in the breaks
and mopped his face on a towel after almost every point, although
temperatures barely climbed to 60 degrees.
''Mark played awfully well,'' he said. ''You have to give him credit.
But my serve was well below par. It was all very amicable on court. But
the result was a little setback in my Wimbledon preparations.''
Rusedski and Petchey are likely to be included in the Davis Cup squad
captain David Lloyd will announce today for a vital relegation tie
against Monaco at Eastbourne next month.
Lloyd admired Petchey's performance. ''It's one thing to complain
about someone taking away your living,'' said Lloyd, ''You have to go
out and do better. And Mark did that.''
Also likely to be called up by Lloyd is Tim Henman, who produced the
best result of his career by toppling Germany's No.16 seed Martin Sinner
7-5, 6-4 to earn a second-round crack at Jeremy Bates.
Henman admitted he has profitted by Rusedski taking the home spotlight
from him. ''I was always in the spotlight this time last year but it's
now on Greg and I have been able to get on with my tennis.''
Danny Sapsford, another Davis Cup contender, defeated Beckenham
champion Andrew Richardson 6-2, 6-4 to bring Britain's second- round
contingent up to four.

JO Durie, the 34-year-old former British No.1, has been granted a
wild-card entry to Wimbledon, her last appearance at the All England
Championships before retirement.
The current leading British player, Claire Wood, has also been given a
wild card, along with other home hopes Karen Cross, Shirli-Ann Siddall
and Florida-based teenager Megan Miller, plus South Africa's Ros
Fairbank Nideffer, the beaten finalist at last week's Beckenham
tournament.
Chris Wilkinson received consolation for his first-round defeat in the
Stella Artois hampionships when he was named as one of six British wild
card entries for the men's singles.
The others are Scotland's Miles MacLagan and Ross Matheson, Oxford's
Tim Henman, Surrey's Danny Sapsford, and Gary Henderson of Yorkshire.
Four more wild cards have yet to be awarded.

John Ross, president of the Scottish National Farmers' Union, reports
on attempts to improve the communications between farmers and the
public.
FOOD and farming issues are now rarely out of the media spotlight.
Gone are the days when a couthie story about a shepherd and his lambs
stuck in a snow drift passed for countryside reporting. Now it's the
meat hook in the eye approach.
Television uses shocking images to capture attention. The techniques
used rule out any hope of balance in the presentation of a story. What
the TV people call a ''talking head'' stands no chance of winning the
encounter when explaining, say, the statistical complexities of the
incidence of BSE set against an emotional voice-over with a powerful
image of a distressed cow staggering over a muddy yard -- you know the
one I mean.
It's easy to get depressed. The media treatment given to issues like
BSE and animal transport has left most farmers bewildered and
frustrated. But it doesn't follow that farming's public image is in
shreds -- as many pundits say.
Farmers are viewed favourably by about two out of three people and are
seen to be extremely hard working and committed to their jobs, this
comes from an independent MORI poll and not the NFU press offce. We are
not complacent but it's as well to know where our strengths lie so we
can build on them. That's just what the Scottish NFU is about to do.
We're in a new media age -- we just can't ignore it any longer -- the
MORI poll tells us where we need to improve public perceptions about our
industry. Farmers are thought to be poor providers of information about
what they do and it is believed by many that profits are put before care
of animals and the environment. Now this will not ring true to most
farmers but we can't afford to allow damaging impressions about farming
and the countryside to go unchallenged.
We learnt a great deal from the recent surge of adverse publicity on
the animal transport issue. More than ever we need to get our story over
to the public.
I don't believe a one-off high profile PR campaign is the answer. What
we need is a long-term strategy. We must start by giving all the help
and support we can to FACETS -- Scotland's Farm and Countryside
Educational Trust. The winning of hearts and minds starts in schools. We
need more farmers willing to take schoolchildren on to the farm and show
them how we care for animals and the countryside. The image some
shareholders have of farming is often completely distorted by years of
propaganda put out by anti-farming groups.
The public need a better understanding about farming and rural life.
It's amazing how few people there are who have any experience at all of
country life. To achieve this we have to establish a thoroughly
professional press service to explain the industry's story on a
day-to-day basis.
We must provide relevant and accurate information about modern farm
practices and about how we create and care for Scotland's countryside.
We must explain that an empty, rundown, depopulated countryside would
destroy one of our country's priceless assets. People need to know that
positive management by farmers keeps rural areas in good shape. That's
the story we must get across to taxpayers and consumers.
I'm delighted that we are now seeing real progress on the Farm Assured
Livestock Scheme (SQBLA). The basic principle of farm assurance is to
let our customers know about the quality of and the way in which food is
produced on Scotland's farms. When it comes to environment or animal
welfare scare stories, membership of the Farm Assurance Scheme is an
ideal insurance policy. But it's also a great opportunity to show the
public that we care about what they think.
Animal welfare issues present the biggest challenge our industry has
faced. I don't normally go for the conspiracy theory line of thinking
but the relentless attacks on meat eating convince me that many of these
so-called animal welfarists are about to destroy our livelihoods -- and
they are employing the media to do it. So we've got to hit back and
there is no point in doing it in a half-hearted way. In the Scottish NFU
we have already started giving key spokespeople media training -- and we
know that it pays.
At the union's council we will have a full and busy day. In the
morning Europe's leading agriculture decision maker Commissioner Franz
Fischler will be spelling out for us his vision of where the Common
Agricultural Policy is going. Later in the day we will, I hope, be
taking a bold decision to invest in a public affairs division at our
union's headquarters.
When I became the union's president, I promised our members that they
would become the best informed farmers in Europe. We've come a long way.
Our information services are highly regarded by farmers and other
professionals in the agricultural world. Now we are running a trial on
the computer Internet system -- our aim is to provide for farmers
instant access to information which is crucial to their business. And we
will be communicating better directly to our members about the work we
do and action we take on their behalf.
So the Scottish NFU is about to take another important step to fulfil
my promise. Practical farmers know that real improvements of any sort
come with a price tag. We treat with respect the money which farmers
volunteer to give us -- we're continually looking for ways to cut costs.
But there's a limit to what can be achieved by good housekeeping. That's
why I want all of our members to think -- and think positively -- about
the absolute need for the union to have sufficient resources to let the
public know that there are plenty of reasons to be proud of the
achievements of Scotland's farmers.

THERE are certain Scottish farming dynasties which through the
generations continue to make their mark in the agricultural world. Among
the foremost, certainly in the south west, few stand higher than the
Dunlops of Midkelton, near Castle Douglas. The latest in that line to
distinguish the family name is Andrew Dunlop who as chairman of the
Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland will be in charge of
the nation's largest spectator event -- The Royal Highland Show.
Renowned for plain speaking, occasionally to the chagrin of others
less forthright, Andrew Dunlop has a justified reputation for getting
things done once the plan has been set. That will be his trademark at
this year's show. But what is it that drives an already busy farmer to
want to be involved in the Royal Highland? Andrew Dunlop candidly as
ever says: ''It's the showpiece for the industry, a shop window if you
like, and it's important that we make use of it to promote the
Scottishness of our agriculture.''
The Royal Highland has over the years become an international event
and Andrew Dunlop is keen to develop that still further but he
recognises that it is a show where business is done. He says: ''We have
a very good relationship with our trade exhibitors and we get the
impression that they feel they do real business at Ingliston and also
that they are better looked after than at any other show. That's the way
we want to keep it.''
The rapport with exhibitors has been a longstanding aspect of the
Royal Highland and it stems from the fact that the directors in charge
of the various sections have ''come up through the system''. He himself
creates a record in being the first son to follow his father as chairman
of the board of directors but there was more to his wish of being
involved than emulating his late father Robin. ''I suppose it was in my
blood and I always had a sort of heart-hankering to make a contribution.
The Highland has always been part of my calendar''.
Andrew Dunlop has two principal themes to his stewardship of the show
''I've been going on for years about exhibitor satisfaction and
spectator appeal. If we get those basics right then the rest falls into
place.''
Constant development of the event and of the showground itself is
another of his objectives: ''We must keep looking forward to the next 10
years. It would be easy to sit back and do nothing because we have an
excellent show and a healthy balance sheet but if we did that the people
who are running the show in 10 years time will turn round and ask what
we were doing.''
Prudent upgrading of Ingliston is Andrew Dunlop's aim. ''We would like
to provide more and better accommodation for the stock attendants, but
we don't want to go into the hotel business. And again we would like to
have new cattle lines but that too must be carefully thought through.''
The farming philosophy of Andrew Dunlop could be said to mirror the
line he takes with RHASS. ''Keep it simple, it's people that make life
complicated''.
That same tack will be the recipe for success at this year's Royal
Highland and in the four- day period he will with his usual deceptively
laid back style relish. ''Most of the hard work has already been done.
It's now just a matter of the team pulling together and getting on with
the job.'' Yes indeed, but every team needs a captain and in Andrew
Dunlop the RHASS has one with an effective game plan that is certain to
produce the championship result that months of hard endeavour deserve.

IT started with a proposal put to directors of the Royal Highland and
Agricultural Society in 1993 and was hatched in 1994. In a small hall
that was used every other week of the year for car auctions the first
Royal Highland Show Food Fair was launched.
Compared to today's Food from Scotland Exhibition extravaganza it
would be called something of an ugly duckling. Only a handful of
Scottish food processors could be persuaded to bring retailing and food
tasting to the nation's premier farm show. But it was a start.
Fraser Morrison was chairman of the board of directors at that time
and he says: ''We were ahead of our time but didn't know it. It worked
then but needed more of the innovators to raise its image.''
And that is what has happened. The 4000 sq m of the Ingliston
Exhibition Hall is now the largest in the world dedicated to the
promotion of quality food products and drinks from Scotland.
Since the Food from Scotland initiative was launched four years ago
its success has exceeded expectation, achieving much more than a link
between farmer/producer and consumer.
It is no longer a fringe part of the Royal Highland Show but a major
event for exhibitors, industry leaders and the public. It is a reason
for going to Ingliston. This year in excess of 400 key food industry
people representing the whole spectrum of High Street trading --
including Fortnum &amp; Mason -- will attend the event to see for themselves
what is new and worthy of shelf space in their stores.
RHAS secretary John Good says much of this has been due to the
sterling work done by Scottish Enterprise and its regional divisions in
assisting food processing entrepreneurs.
''Scottish farmers and food processors have a long-standing,
world-wide reputation for the quality of the primary product and in
recent years have learned how to become more competitive in the
international market place.''
The 150,000 visitors expected over the four days of the show this year
will see the world's biggest display of meat, seafood, bakery, preserves
and jams, dairy produce, alcoholic beverages and frozen and prepared
foods.
For more than 60 of the exhibitors it is more than a chance to display
and sell wares. They are competing for the Scottish Food Innovation
Awards, which provide a launching pad for recognition in the
international market place. These new products add to the already
promised gastronomic extravaganza.
RHAS chairman Robert Forrest said: ''The Food from Scotland Exhibition
offers exhibitors a chance to meet key buyers and users. It is an
excellent platform to launch new products as companies can gauge
consumer reactions and preferences and gain valuable feedback which may
help in future product development.
''Scottish companies are making a significant investment to ensure
that products achieve high visibility in the market place and the
exhibition enables them to showcase their goods to the catering,
wholesale and retail trade while recouping some of their costs through
stand sales.''
Together with the Highland Show's honey and cheese competitions the
Food from Scotland Exhibition can be seen as part of the RHAS's remit in
improving opportunities for rural-based communities and their
industries.
A large part of this success is due to the endeavours of Scottish
Enterprise and its regional organisations which have provided fresh
initiatives to producers and processors both in the creation and
marketing of products.
An excellent example of this will be seen at the Food from Scotland
centre-piece display focusing on Dumfries and Galloway. The area's
enterprise organisation, together with the regional council, is creating
a massive food sculpture to demonstrate the variety and versatility of
food from the area.
The importance of the Innovation Awards is underlined by Colin Warden,
managing director of Castle MacLellan Foods, overall winners at last
year's event when it launched Orkney herring pate -- a product so
popular that in 12 months it accounts for 10% of pre-packed sales.
''We fully endorse strategic alliance among Scotland's food producers
and processors, allowing small and medium-sized companies to pool their
expertise. For entrepreneurs with innovative new products but perhaps
lacking in marketing skills or the financial resources of the more
established producers it offers a way forward. There are benefits for
the food producers working in partnership and for their customers who
have a greater choice.''
And choice there will be. Meats and meat products, game, poultry,
dairy products, seafood and savouries are only part of what will be on
offer to tempt the taste buds of visitors.
It is therefore not surprising that some 70% of visitors to Ingliston
this year will be making the Food from Scotland Exhibition their main
reason for being there.

IS the Scottish farming industry fit for the twenty-first century? The
answer to this question is of more than passing interest to Scotland's
farmers, their advisers, bankers and farming politicians. Donald JR
MacRae, senior manager, agricultural services, TSB Bank Scotland
appraises the current financial performance of the industry and
identifies some strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
requiring some serious attention in the medium to long term.
SCOTTISH FARMING INCOME
CHART 1
Scottish aggregate farming income jumped during 1994 to #381m. This
represents an increase of 31% on the previous year and is
two-and-a-quarter times the level achieved during 1991. The first chart
tracks the progress of aggregate farming income from 1990 to 1994.
No-one can deny the substantial increase in farming's fortunes
illustrated in these figures.
NET INVESTMENT SPENDING
CHART 2
This chart shows the latest available data for net investment spending
for the years 1989/90 to 1993/94 as an index with the level in 1989/90
expressed as 100. Investment by Scottish farmers dipped during 1990/91
by 14% compared to the level in 1989/90 but has increased every year
since to a level in 1993/94 almost twice the level of 1989/90. Some of
the investment is no doubt making up for poor levels of investment in
previous years and for necessary expenditure to comply with
environmental legislation but the overall conclusion from examination of
these figures is that Scottish farmers have the confidence to reinvest
their profits for the future.
ALL BANKS-TOTAL ADVANCES
CHART 3
The third chart shows total advances to Scottish agriculture by all
banks from 1990 to 1994. The latest figure as at May 1994 for all bank
borrowing is #869m. This is largely unchanged from the figure
experienced in 1990. The increase recorded in 1994 of #24m is due to an
increase in investment and purchase of farmland. These figures are all
the more impressive if one looks back to 1986 when farm borrowing
reached #953m. An even rosier picture is achieved by taking account of
inflation. The May 1994 figure is some 9% lower in nominal or actual
terms compared to the peak 1986 figure and if adjusted for inflation is
some 38% lower. These statistics confirm the significant increase in the
financial performance of the farming ndustry.
DIRECT GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES
CHART 4
A more sober appraisal of these trends comes with the fourth chart
which shows the total of direct grants and subsidies paid to the
industry between 1990 and 1994. The figure in 1994 of #332m (some 87% of
aggregate income) is almost two- and-a-quarter times the figure of 1990.
Moreover, this figure only records direct payments. It takes no account
of Scotland's share of operating the rest of the EU support system.
According to estimates produced recently by Government, the total figure
exceeds #500m. The immediate question is: is this sustainable in the
long term?
The Scottish farming industry has some major strengths. It operates
large farms benefiting from economies of scale, has an excellent record
of innovation and husbandry and is backed up by an impressive array of
advisory services. However, its weaknesses are also apparent. Despite
years of talking about marketing, farmers, with the exception of the
milk sector, have little market power when compared to food retailers.
Many farm co-ops concentrate on the supply of farm imputs rather than
adding value to farm outputs. Attitudes toward co-operation and the loss
of independence in return for more market power are mixed at best.
Opportunities do exist for an industry willing to change. Scottish
farming, with the exception of hill farming in less favoured areas, will
cope with less public support a lot better than some small farms in the
southern half of the EU and in Germany. The competitive advantage of
farm structure will tell in the end. Despite a lukewarm start, farm
assurance has become established and Scottish exports of beef and lamb
are exploiting the value of the Scottish brand name for quality. Much of
Scottish agriculture production is produce in a way which is not only
environmentally friendly but animal friendly. The industry needs to grab
these opportunities with both hands.
Threats, as well as opportunities, are apparent. In the medium term,
the EU will extend eastwards to include eastern European countries such
as Poland and Hungary. It is impossible that the current high level of
EU payments will be extended at a similar level to all farmers in these
new entrant countries such as Poland. The EU agriculture budget, already
accounting for more than half of the total EU spend and already
overspent for next year will not be able to cope. EU farm policy, for
decades dominated and controlled by the small farmer, will have to take
account of change including more market access for American exports and
a decline of the agricultural vote.
Scottish farmers have coped with the challenge of change for
centuries. If the same attitude to adopting new agricultural technology
that pioneered the change from the ''grey Fergie'' to the 100hp
four-wheel drive was brought to bear on creating a new agricultural
policy framework, the results could be not just good but excellent.
The industry is enjoying a boom at present fuelled by EU support and
green pound devaluations. These epitomise politicians' support. Many
other sectors of industry have learnt that politicians' support is
ephemeral. Farmers should start preparing themselves for change. The
rewards could be great.

TULLIS Russell, the Fife paper-maker which was turned over to its
employees, reported higher profits for the year to March despite a
doubling of pulp prices.
Tullis Russell made a pre-tax profit of #6.3m after a #2.1m charge for
profit-sharing among its 1200 employees.
This compared with a pre-tax profit of #4.6m in the previous financial
year before Tullis Russell set up an employee share ownership scheme to
gradually transfer ownership from the Russell family to company
employees.
The dividend rose to a single payout of 1.5p per share from 1.3p
previously.
Turnover increased to #124m from #101m and the volume of paper
produced by Tullis Russell's main factory at Markinch rose 26% to
106,000 tonnes.
Finance director George Wishart said the company had boosted its
profits because of an increase in volume sales.
The group's overall margins had been maintained despite a doubling of
raw material prices, but there had been some erosion in the margin on
paper products, he added.
The finance director said pulp prices were still rising and it would
be difficult for Tullis Russell to maintain the same rate of growth this
year. ''I don't think we will be able to grow our volume again next year
at quite the same pace,'' he said.
''We are very much tied up with what happens in general paper
market,'' Mr Wishart said, ''but right now I am optimistic.''
Tullis Russell was founded by the Russell family in 1809 and it ran
the business as a private company for the best part of two centuries.
But last July the Russells set up an employee share ownership scheme
to transfer control to the workforce over a period of up to 15 years.
The exact length of the transition period depends on the level of
company profits which will fund the buy-out.
The driving force behind the change in status was company chairman
David Erdal, who intensified a long tradition of paternalistic
management by the Russell family when he took over in 1985.
Mr Erdal, 49, was a Marxist in his youth and visited China during the
cultural revolution, but his politics moderated after he took an MBA at
Harvard Business School.
Nevertheless, much of his idealism remained and soon after taking over
as chairman from his late uncle, Sir David Russell, he set up a
profit-sharing scheme for company employees.
About #1.6m of the #2.1m of profit retained for employees last year
was distributed as a cash bonus. The remaining #500,000 was used to buy
shares for the workforce.
Employees currently own about 1% of Tullis Russell, which has four
specialist paper factories in the UK in addition to the main plant in
Fife.
A further 12% is held indirectly on their behalf through a
profit-sharing scheme, 31% is held by an Employee Benefit Fund and 56%
is owned by Russell Trust, which has charitable status.
Last year, after strong lobbying by Mr Erdal, 25 members of the
Russell family surrendered their 55% controlling stake in the company in
return for #19m of loan notes which are redeemable over 10 to 15 years.
The deal went ahead after the 1994 Finance Act granted new income tax
benefits to employee share ownership schemes that made them more
attractive.

THE Scottish machinery ring network which involves farmers pooling
their equipment is going from strength to strength at an astonishing
rate with a collective turnover in the past year for the fourteen rings
breaking through the #10m mark. This is an increase of 30% on the
previous year while at the same time total membership now stands at just
over 3500 representing around 25% of the total number of farmers.
Reacting to the statistics the chairman of the Scottish Machinery
Rings Association, Sandy Braid who farms near Kinross, commented ''I
think I'm almost surprised, but I believe the reason is that the several
former sceptics have put a toe in the water, had a good long look,
considered just what it costs to buy new machinery and decided that the
rings can do a good job for them.''
The SMRA will be in attendance at next week's Royal Highland Show
where local ring managers will be on hand to explain both the physical
and financial benefits of membership. The message they will be
attempting to get across is that by utilising a ring rather than owning
machinery with all the cost of repairs and depreciation farmers can on
an average Scottish mixed unit of 250 acres lift the overall
profitability by around #5000.
The first Scottish ring was set up in the Borders eight years ago with
assistance from the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society under the
direction of its chief executive Edward Rainy Brown who said yesterday
''We helped a group of farmers to set up a formal Co-op based on the
German concept and since then we've been involved with both strategic
and business development of all the other rings. We don't give them
money as such but assist in getting the structure in place.''
During the last six years SAOS has devoted a large part of its
energies to machinery rings and Mr Rainy Brown believes that the
potential is there for still further growth. He said ''It's a success
story which is only starting to run because in the arable sector there
has not been too much pressure over the last couple of years on incomes
and costs but when these return farmers will have to plan carefully and
the rings may be the answer for many. The great thing about a ring in
comparison to other co-ops is that the memberships see an immediate
financial benefit.''
Mr Braid is in no doubt from his own personal experiences that rings
membership has helped his farming. He commented ''I would never think of
buying a round baler, but on the other hand with our fickle local
climate around Kinross I prefer to have two combines. That in theory is
too much, but on the other hand I can hire those machines out through
the ring. Just recently I was getting behind with spraying because of
the weather, but was soon able to catch up by calling in the ring.''

TRADING at Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed has returned almost to normal
after a disappointing final quarter last year, the brewery and pubs
group announced yesterday.
The improved results were achieved despite disruption to sales
following an extensive refurbishment programme to 50 of its pubs at a
cost of #12.6m.
Sales from pubs rose by 12.2% with drinks 9.5% up and food 20.1%
higher. By the end of the year the group had 228 managed pubs with a
further 653 tenanted.
Its Pedigree bitter also succeeded in increasing market share and is
being exported with Head Brewer's Choice to Russia.
''We believe that our brand strength, a continually improving licensed
estate and a reputation for high standards of customer service will
secure further progress in both the medium and longer term,'' chairman
Michael Hurdle said.
For the year to March 25, the group based at Burton-on-Trent,
Staffordshire, pushed pre-tax profits 5.6% higher to #24.6m from #23.3m
in the corresponding period in the previous 12 months.
Investors are being rewarded with a total payout of 6.56p compared
with 5.96p on earnings per share of 20.06p against 19.21p.
Overall beer sales volumes increased by 2% compared with flat volumes
for the industry as a whole.

DETERGENTS and personal care manufacturer McBride whose products
include Tesco's Bath in Chocolate is coming to the market with a price
tag of about #340m.
The company was sold by BP in May 1993 for #275m to a management
buy-in team led by Mike Hanley, a professional manager previously with
the RHM foods group.
About #220m is being raised of which #160m will be to repay #110m of
Preference capital and #50m to reduce debt. The remainder will arise
from original shareholders reducing their stakes by a third.
Around 25% of the shares will be made available to the British public.
McBride is the largest European supplier of own-label products with
dominant shares in the UK, Belgium, France, and Italy and more recently
Spain. Mr Hanley pointed out that Ariel or Persil, selling at 425p in a
supermarket, would compete head-on with the own-label brand such as
Asda's Integra or Sainsbury's Novon at 369p and of equivalent quality
and offering the retailer a larger cash margin.
Since 1980, the own-label business in Britain has grown from 20% to
37% of the UK grocery market where the big five have about a 60% market
share.
The own-label sector in Britain is twice that of Europe and so McBride
is looking to exploit Continental markets.
It is forecasting pre-tax profits for the year to end June to increase
22% to #26.9m but is warning that currently margins are under pressure
because of raw material prices. However, McBride is successfully pushing
through its own adjustments of about 4% and is looking to a good
performance in the second half of next year.
Full details of the Warburg sponsored offer will become available on
June 21.

GUARDIAN Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, The Observer and The

warned that current trading was ''more difficult''. Group profits before
tax and minority interest for the year ended April 2 was #27.01m against
#11.67m, fulfilling predictions of a year of ''strong profit growth''.
However, trading conditions in the current year were tougher. ''As the
price of newsprint continues to escalate and the national newspaper
coverprice war continues, the pressure on profit margins will be
considerable,'' it said.
Nevertheless the group had a strong balance sheet with ''hardly any''
borrowings and was better placed than most to continue expansion.
It is paying an unchanged 3p preference dividend.

SARACEN Value Trust, set up last year to invest in smaller UK
companies, said yesterday that it plans to nearly double its capital
with the issue of about #30m 'C' conversion shares.
The trust was launched with #35m of capital on March 7, 1994, by SFM
Investment Managers, a Glasgow-based company set up by three former
employees of Scottish Amicable.
Despite a 9% fall in net asset value during its first year as share
prices slumped across the board, the trust easily outperformed its
benchmark FTSE SmallCap index (excluding investment trusts), which
tumbled 15.4% during the 12 months to end March.
SFM managing director Jim Fisher said that over the last two months
Saracen Value Trust had fully recovered its NAV at launch because of a
general recovery on the stock market.
''We are now more or less back to where we started at in March 1994,
but that puts us 8.4% ahead of the FTSE SmallCap index,'' Mr Fisher
said.
''You can see that the smaller companies are outperforming the main
market and we are outperforming the index,'' he added.
Saracen shares fell 1p to 91p yesterday, leaving them at a 5.5%
discount to the trust's official NAV of 96.06p at the end of May.
Natwest Seurities estimated the fully diluted NAV at 95.74 yesterday.
Mr Fisher said institutional investors who are newcomers to the trust
are expected to subscribe at least #12m of the new shares.
Existing shareholders, again mostly institutional investors, would
subscribe the rest, he added.
A free warrant to buy one ordinary share at #1 will be offered with
every five 'C' shares sold. This may be exerised between the share
conversion date and 2001.
Existing shareholders will be allowed to subscribe for 'C' shares on a
one-for-one basis, but there will be some clawback to give small
investors, who own about 5% of Saracen, more opportunity to increase
their holding.
Charterhouse Tilney Securities, which underwrote Saracen's original
issue, is underwriting the new shares.
Mr Fisher said there was an underwriting commission of 0.5% and full
fees and commissions would amount to 1.7%.
The exact volume of new shares to be issued will be fixed on June 29
when the underwriting agreement is signed. The issue will then be
formally approved at a shareholders' meeting on July 21.
Mr Fisher said the capital raised will be invested quickly and the new
'C' shares should become convertible into Ordinary shares within about
six weeks.
''We think that smaller companies are very cheap right now, so why
should we sit on cash?,'' he said.
Saracen Value Trust currently holds shares in 64 companies listed in
the FTSE Smaller Capital Index. Its single largest holding is in Inspec,
a specialist chemicals company, which acounts for about 4.5% of the
portfolio.

DUNBEATH CASTLE must be one of the most picturesque properties in
Scotland. Perched high above the Moray Firth, the castle was the
stronghold of the Sinclair Clan for around 500 years, undergoing steady
improvements and extension to match the changing needs of the family and
history.
It changed hands in 1977. ''Since then the present laird has
maintained his objective to preserve and maintain all aspects of the
estate and the community so that all can survive and live together. The
Dunbeath Manifesto has been a blueprint for the successful ownership of
many Highland Estates,'' claims selling agents Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
who are marketing the entire Dunbeath estate, which lies approximately
20 miles south of Wick and about 90 miles north of Inverness.
The castle's rooms have dramatic views of the rugged coastline, the
sheltered gardens, and the North Sea. The origins of Dunbeath have been
lost over the succeeding centuries but the present castle is basically
late sixteenth-century with extensive remodelling about 100 years ago by
David Bryce, one of Scotland's foremost architects.
The property is approached by a long drive from the lodge and the
impressive symmetrical castle slowly comes into view.
The castle has magnificent features with matching bow stair turrets
and corbelled bases. To the north is a square tower with a crenellated
parapet whilst the eastern section includes fine Scots baronial
architecture. There is excellent stonework with the Sinclair coat of
arms and a ''knotted rope'' lintel over the main door.
Internally, Dunbeath includes a suite of reception rooms with a
magnificent carved staircase, panelled landings and an elegant drawing
room with magnificent plasterwork. The principal bedroom suite enjoys
total privacy. All bedrooms in the ancient wing of the castle are well
served with bathrooms. The castle includes a comprehensive service floor
with kitchen and ample stores.
Under the present ownership the castle has been thoroughly renovated
and restored. Externally, this has included complete reslating and
releading, as well as rendering. Some 42 sash windows were replaced
during the programme of restoration. The castle has been rewired and
replumbed and is provided with high calibre security and fire alarm
systems.
''In short, the castle now provides an elegant residence of enormous
character in exemplary condition,'' say the agents.
The gardens and grounds provide a magnificent backdrop to the ancient
fortalice. The show of spring daffodils on either side of the drive is a
delightful sight in the spring, while the woodland floor of the wild
garden is a succession of colour from snow drops, aconites, and
daffodils leading to a blaze of bluebells in mid-summer.
On either side of the drive is a walled garden. There are two elevated
viewing points on the south wall overlooking the castle and a range of
outbuildings to the west.
The garden buildings include three greenhouses in the south garden.
The north walled garden is the former laundry building has planning
consent for conversion and extension to form a residence with three
reception room, four bedrooms and two bathrooms.
The ancient doo'cot in the wild garden is the special feature.
The stable yard is stone built with a pigeon loft and drum tower. The
buildings include the former tack room, extensive garaging, three former
stalls and a tractor shed.
An apartment within the former stable yard has been renovated and is
used for short visits or as an annexe.
The accommodation is built of stone under a newly slated roof with:
turnpike staircase and handrail leading to the first level with living
room, kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms.
The gardener's lodge has a sitting room and two bedrooms.
Further inland, Balcraggie Lodge is a traditional shooting lodge on
the estate which lies in an elevated position above the Dunbeath Water
with views over the Strath to the distant North Sea.
The Lodge was built in 1882 and has the date stone with Sinclair
initials over the main entrance. The accommodation over two floors
includes a gun room, drawing room, dining room, butler's pantry/servery,
kitchen and utility room , five bedrooms (the main bedroom with dressing
room) and three bathrooms.
There is a range of outbuildings.
The total estate comprises the 15th century castle, the Victorian
shooting lodge, the factor's house, 12 cottages, the entire Ddunbeath
Water and its catchment area, and about 30,000 acres of deer forest and
grouse moor.

Quality and design were paramount in Josiah Wedgwood's creation of
world-famous china 200 years ago. Lesley Duncan discovers that his
descendants still live by such standards
LORD Wedgwood tells a story. The first time he visited the colonial
town of Williamsburg, Virginia, he watched a re-enactment of American
revolutionaries' ransacking the place and throwing out all sorts of
English merchandise. One shop had a wooden barrel, out of which was
tipped Wedgwood pottery. Lord Wedgwood's host was somewhat shocked on
his behalf. Lord Wedgwood himself ''jumped for joy''. For it
demonstrated that Wedgwood pottery was a standard export to the Americas
as early as 1776.
On his mission as a roving ambassador for the china firm, Lord
Wedgwood (full title Piers Anthony Weymouth, 4th Lord Wedgwood of
Barlaston) frequently visits the States. However, he was to be found
last week holding court in the Brobdingnagian salons of the Victoria and
Albert Museum, London, where a major exhibition -- The Genius of
Wedgwood -- was opened on Thursday by the Duke of Edinburgh. He is in
Glasgow today and Edinburgh tomorrow.
The seventh-generation descendant of the great Josiah Wedgwood is a
big, genial, pinstriped-suited man, eminently suited for his role in
promoting the firm. He bears an uncanny resemblance to his forebear.
Brought up in Kenya (''a wonderful way for a boy to grow up''), he
left East Africa when Kenya became independent, went to Marlborough
College and Sandhurst, and almost made the army his career. For several
years he served in the Royal Scots. Then ''something told me there might
be change ahead,'' he recalls. The opportunity to start his connection
with the Wedgwood company came.
He spent a considerable time at the Wedgwood factory in Staffordshire,
he says, learning as much as he could not only about the manufacturing
processes but about the history and heritage of the company.
These themes are, of course, central to the impressive exhibition at
the Victoria and Albert Museum, which pays tribute to the innovative
talents of the firm's founder, Josiah. The exhibition places Josiah in
the social and economic context of his time -- he was a Fellow of the
Royal Society -- and describes his innovative techniques as well as
showing superb examples of his craftsmen's work.
Of all Wedgwood products, the blue Jasper ware with its white
classical moulding is the one most globally synonymous with the firm. It
took Josiah five years to develop the technique of giving ceramics an
even colour as the background to the classical motifs then so much in
fashion thanks to architects such as Robert Adam.
Blistered plaques that went wrong at the firing stage are a touching
reminder of the effort that goes into such technological breakthroughs.
A marvellously energetic plaque, The Fall of Phaeton -- designed and
modelled by George Stubbs and showing horses leaping through clouds with
their charioteer -- demonstrates the expressive possibilities of the
medium.
Since Jasper ware was perfected only in 1776, the pottery disgorged
from the Williamsburg barrel was Queen's Ware. So is the central glory
of the exhibition, a selection from Catherine the Great's celebrated
Frog Service, commissioned from Josiah Wedgwood by the Russian Empress
in 1773. Some 700 of its original 952 pieces are now held by the State
Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg. The pieces on loan (more than 200) came
across Europe unscathed in a five-and-a-half day journey with their
escort, Lydia Liackhova. Both she and the Hermitage's director, Dr
Mikhail Piotrovskii, were present at the official opening.
The great service takes its name from the jaunty little green frog
which decorates each piece. The service was designed for Catherine's new
Kekerekeksinensky Palace (also known as La Grenouillerie after its
location in a frog marsh). Catherine was an Anglophile and each dish and
plate in the cream-coloured service is decorated with monochrome
pictures of great British houses, parks and landscapes, and even
industries. Oak or ivy leaves wreath the scenes. Apart from the beauty
of the individual plates (some triangular) and tureens, the whole
represents not only a triumph of manufacturing but, albeit
inadvertently, a comprehensive record of Britain in the late eighteenth
century.
Then there are the Wedgwood vases, including the great Portland Vase.
Josiah Wedgwood responded to the challenge of reproducing the classical
original. It took him three years.
Josiah was very much a man of the Enlightenment, intellectually
curious and advanced in his treatment of his workforce. He was also
tough, surviving a leg amputation without anaesthetic or anticeptic. He
planted a rose garden beside his factory and, being aware of the
problems of working with lead, made his workforce wash and change
clothes. He also supplied candles for their night work -- unusual for
the time. Lord Wedgwood quotes Josiah's philosophy -- ''Making artists
of mere men and machines of men that cannot err.'' A somewhat gnomic
utterance.
The bicentenary is being marked not only by the Victoria and Albert
exhibition but by the issuing of commemorative pieces. These range from
the ''Josiah Collection'' (featuring handwriting and signatures taken
from original letters penned by Josiah on St Valentine's Day, 1774) to a
round tray and plate with a portrait of Josiah in Blue Jasper and
reproductions of five plates from the Frog Service. The china shell
dish, designed by an Italian student and winner of the Josiah Wedgwood
Bicentennial Award, is a modern tribute.
In keeping with their founder's innovative flair, the company looks
forward to the next 200 years. ''We would like to think we could
continue in the same mode, just as the great man would have approved,''
says Lord Wedgwood.
He sees the Wedgwood legacy as threefold. First, quality: this year's
large development of new products is only possible because of it, he
says. Second, design: ''There are many great manufacturers,'' says Lord
Wedgwood, ''but I like to believe that Wedgwood is distinctive.'' Third,
skill: ''Our craftsmen and women are extremely important.'' Modern
technology helps in the manufacture of products of more consistent
quality, he points out, but the actual skills of decorating and
ornamenting play an essential role. ''We've challenged the skill of our
top craftsmen and women,'' says Lord Wedgwood, ''and they have certainly
risen to the challenge'' -- turning sometimes, indeed, to Josiah's
original records.
There are ''tremendous plans'' for further developments, reflecting
changing tastes in some instances. ''We are looking forward to feeding
demand in the same way Josiah Wedgwood was recognised as doing in his
time,'' says this eloquent company ambassador.
* Lord Wedgwood visits Glasgow today and will be at the Stockwell
Bazaar, Glassford Street, between 11.30am and 7pm. He will present the
winner of a recent Herald Homes &amp; Gardens competition with a wine ewer
worth #1750 (at 1.30pm) and he will be signing cameo cards for the first
100 customers.

WHEN Cardross was a village the locals augmented their incomes by
picking whelks from the rocks on the shore.
These days, commuters shell out substantial sums for the local
properties which offer easy travel by road or rail to Glasgow city
centre.
Kilmahew Cottage is typical of the country style homes available in
the area around Cardross. It stands on the Kilmahew Estate where
Kilmahew House was built for John Burns, son of the Scot who helped
found the Cunard line. The cottage faces south, with views over the
countryside to the Firth of Clyde.
It offers flexible family accommodation with scope for an entirely
self-contained flat. The garden has been extensively landscaped.
Kilmahew Cottage is convenient for access to the local conservation
village, with local shopping as well as a primary school and regular
electric train service to Glasgow. Helensburgh has a fuller range of
amenities.
The agents, Slater Hogg &amp; Howison are looking for offers over #190,000
for Kilmahew Cottage.

SUN, sea, sand, and...Slater Hogg &amp; Howison? The Scottish estate
agency has just made its first breakthrough into selling property in
Europe.
The firm is now marketing properties on the Spanish mainland and in
the Balearics on behalf of Taylor Woodrow.
Prices start at #57,500 for a three-bedroom ground floor flat (prices
are sterling-equivalent and calculated on the basis of 200 pesetas to
the pound).
The island developments are located at Son Parc, Menorca and Na
Taconera, Majorca. The mainland developments are at Moraira, north of
Alicante, and Duquesa, south-west of Marbella.
Taylor Woodrow has been building in Spain for years.
The standard of accommodation is luxurious, according to the agents,
and all the developments have swimming pools, satellite television and
an underground garage or covered parking.
In Dequesa, the homes overlook the first fairway of the Dequesa Golf &amp;
Country Club.
Slater Hogg's corporate manager Alan Baxter says: ''Slater Hogg has
never been involved in the sale of property abroad, but in Taylor
Woodrow we have experienced partners with a good reputation in this
area.
''We were told by Taylor Woodrow that the Scots are among the highest
percentage of buyers of foreign property in Spain.''We are excited at
the opportunity of presenting these properties to those who may be
considering a second home, or a retirement home, in this beautiful part
of the world.''

A PROTEST to mark the 100th day of a campaign against live animal
exports from the port of Brightlingsea, Essex, ended with 63 arrests
yesterday.
Police mounted a major operation, with 250 officers, after warnings
that the anniversary would attract protesters from all over the country.
Assistant Chief Constable Geoffrey Markham said the demonstration was
a success for both police and protesters.
''It was reasonably peaceful. The 63 arrested had declared their
intention to be arrested before the event.''
Around 500 campaigners took part in the protest but no-one was hurt in
the few minor scuffles as police removed or persuaded people sitting in
the street leading to the port to clear the road.
Two lorries carrying calves and 300 sheep for export abroad got
through the town in about half an hour.
* Magistrates have given permission for three people arrested in
connection with a weekend firebomb attack on an abattoir in Cinderford,
Gloucestershire, to be held for a further 36 hours.

DISPATCH from Tenerife: written on the back of a carton of duty-free
Marlboro Lights, the cheap souvenir pen struggling to find purchase
against the greasy surface of the Ambre Solaire-stained cardboard. Your
ardent correspondent has ventured where few broadsheet journos would
dare to go and has braved Playa de Los Americas, the seething, brawling
maw of this most commercialised of the Canary Islands.
If this coastline town has ever fought a war against ugly, rapacious
development, it shows little sign of it, so complete is its apparent
surrender, boasting as it does bars bearing English sobriquets which are
so foul and so sordid they cannot be committed to print, and which would
bring blushes to the rudest of company.
Brightly coloured boxes stand enticingly outside supermarkets,
alongside kiddies' buckets and spades; put in a coin, turn a lever, and
the machine will disgorge a big plastic egg. You unscrew the threaded
halves of these gaudy eggs and out spills a condom and a nasty nylon
G-string.
My friend Julie, a seasoned London hack, and I were shocked into
uncharacteristic silence by this seedy town. Fortunately, we were soon
safely ensconced in Fortress Girlie, finding a haven at our luxurious
palm-tree'd apartment complex with Julie's six mad mates.
Amazonian in spirit, if not in flesh (how could women my age be so
teenagey thin?) they had already completed a thorough recce. Having
pinpointed the town's worst spots, they were determined to storm them.
In the face of such courage Julie and I gulped and volunteered for the
front.
Each night we psyched ourselves up and set off for Veronicas -- a glut
of 180 bars and clubs; a pulsating fray of Tenerife nightlife. Like
young bloods we whooped and hollered and danced with fiendish energy,
collecting scalps along the way; cackling uproariously at any man fool
enough to try to breach our platoon and chat one of us up.
Sometimes someone, battle weary, would fall prey to these clumsy
seductions and occasionally such fraternising with the enemy was
tolerated, but only briefly. Fortress Girlie would soon regroup, the
ranks swooping down to execute a rescue, with stern admonitions.
The week passed in a bliss of mutual adoration, the sarky,
affectionate banter of the day replaced by the regular ''love-in''
sessions of the night, when we would convene to compete at dishing out
superlatives, awarding bizarre accolades.
Sultry, well-sussed Lisa was not only best at getting up in the
morning but also had the Best Packed Bag. Sex goddess Rebecca had Best
War Wounds; she merely had to glance at a table or stool and it would
leap out to bruise her peach-like skin. Lorraine had Best Shoes, high,
strappy silver sandals -- instantly dubbed ''dolly shoes'' -- in which
she danced with gazelle-like grace.
The irrepressibly good-humoured Fiona had the Best Tan, but this was a
source of such envy and resentment that it could not be acknowledged,
and she was instead praised for making Best Eggs. I had Best Burnt Ears.
Pretty, pale-skinned, dark-haired Elspeth, who shunned the pool, was
Best Vampire, despite her protests and acquisition of burns. Poor Julie,
normally effervescent, was Best Invalid, copping a horrid bout of
bronchitis which confined her to bed for days -- well out of the running
in the tan sweepstake.
Sharp-tongued Annmarie had the enviable quality of not only being best
at attracting men but also best at slagging them off.
Sadly, the first week sped by and the girls departed. The still-weak
Julie and I (totally exhausted by now) instantly scaled down the
Tenerife Offensive, forsaking the nightclub jungle for quieter
territory. We found it surprisingly quickly by speeding away from the
construction-scarred coastline in a catamaran.
A few hours later groups of pilot whales were nosing around the cat,
obligingly surfacing for water-spouting photo opportunities. Meanwhile,
spirited wild dolphins raced past in frothy delight, flipping out of the
water to salute one another, leaving us speechless once more, this time
with delight.
The dolphins and whales, the serene swim in a bay dotted with the
makeshift wigwams and cave abodes of naturist hippies, the giant crabs
scuttling across spray-dampened rocks, the black cat sulking on the
harbour wall, framed by an extravagant sunset; were these sensory
snapshots the ''authentic Tenerife?''
Or did this determination to resist the dominant culture of Tenerife,
that of full English breakfasts, neon signs, Jock, Geordie, and Cockney
hustlers and silly souvenirs not smack of hypocrisy? When Julie had to
return to London's calling, leaving me as a sole soldier, it struck me
that it was a bit phoney reading a Cormac McCarthy novel -- ''fabled
sturgeons with their horny pentagonal bodies, the cupreous and
dace-bright carp and catfish with their pale and sprueless
underbellies'' -- beside a pool asplash with lime-green crocodile lilos
and fat families wearing slogan T-shirts, eg, ''It's 96[DEG] in Tenerife
and it's pissing down in Britain.''
A conversation with my tour rep brought final enlightenment. Quizzed
about the island's attractions she gushed about Tenerife's only Marks &amp;
Spencer, an hour's drive away in the north. My lip visibly curled and
she faltered. ''You can get new knicks there,'' she pointed out. ''Do I
look like a woman who doesn't bring clean underwear on holiday?'' I
huffed. Her surgically applied smile almost dropped but she recovered.
''Well, you know, it's a home from home.''
''I came on holiday to get away from all that,'' I snapped.
An eerie calm came over her and she gave me a pitying look which
clearly indicated she thought I was bonkers. The peseta dropped. She was
right. You pays your money and you takes your choice and I had always
known what I was letting myself in for.
It was time to still the sneer, to give up the fight, to surrender to
Tenerife's tack. It was time to buy a Jackie Collins.

AFTER almost two centuries of decline, the tide of change is bringing
new life to one of the most historic parts of Glasgow.
In the eighterenth century the area around St Andrew's Square and the
Saltmarket was one of Glasgow's most prestigious residential areas, but
the westward drift of the well-to-do during the nineteenth century
turned the district into a residential backwater.
Now a total redevelopment of St Andrew's Square and some of the
surrounding buildings will offer a wide range of housing in historic
buildings. The scheme is being carried out in seven stages around the
centrepiece of St Andrew's Church, one of Scotland's most important
architectural gems. When complete, will create a new community of 120
flats and maisonettes.
Where possible, existing buildings are being restored and the new
dwellings developed behind retained facades. Where retention is
impossible and complete new-build is required, new construction is
designed to chime in with the existing architecture.
The first phases of the project are being carried out by City Link
Developments, in association with Glasgow Development Agency and Glasgow
District Council.
Construction is well under way, and consists of the redevelopment of
Tannery Building at 46-48 St Andrew's Square, which stands just to the
right of the church.
The listed building has been refurbished to form 18 flats and two
office units, and many of the flats have views from the back across
Glasgow Green to the Clyde and beyond.
Further stages will see the redevelopment of adjacent buildings and
then, directly across the square, The Orphanage at numbers 13-21 will
provide a variety of apartments.
The redevelopment of three sides of the square will be completed by
the creation of a new-build terrace behind the church where the
apartments will be built behind a Georgian-style facade which will match
the rest of the square.
Some of the flats in the first phase will be used for rental by GAP
Housing Association. Flats for sale will range in price from #55,000 to
#100,000 while maisonettes will cost around #95,000.
''We wanted to create an upmarket element within the development,''
says City Link Developments' director Ronnie McLetchie.
''The Maisonettes are like penthouses - they all have balconies on to
the square, views from the back to the river Clyde and some have
minstrel galleries.''
When complete, three gracious terraces will provide a remarkable frame
for the church, which is also scheduled for redevelopment.
A further four phases of residential development will bring more
quality housing to the historic area.
New-build housing is under construction in a block between the square
and the Green. Further new-build terraces on Greendyke Street and London
Road will mark the boundaries of the development. The listed former
Hide, Skin, and Tallow Market at 33-39 Greendyke Street (now there's an
address to remember) will be refurbished to contain flats with views
directly across the road to Glasgow Green.
Like many other housing developments, St Andrew's Square was halted in
its tracks by the property crash. Work started on The Tannery building
in 1990 just in time to see house sales flayed by the recession. This
was an eerie reminder of the past.
When it was first built the church stood in open fields by the side of
the Molendinar Burn. Consent for housing around the church was first
granted in 1757, but the development languished in the doldrums for 30
years before market demand picked up. The magnificent church was not
framed by townhouses until the late 1780s.
Now St Andrew's Square will once again offer good quality housing in
the East End of the Glasgow and will boost the drive towards
redevelopment of declining city centre sites as against green belt
development.
''People will be buying into a wonderful part of Glasgow's history,''
says Ronnie McLetchie. ''Glasgow Green is one of Europe's few areas of
common ground.''
''It has been the site of everything from an ancient bishop's forest
to the launching pad in 1785 for Scotland's first balloon flight. The
industrialist and philanthropist David Dale lived nearby and this part
of the city was popular with merchants and brokers in the 18th
century.''
The people who will repopulate the historic square will find
themselves overlooking one of the city's architectural treasures.
St Andrew's church was built between 1732 and 1757 by architect Allan
Dreghorn and master mason Mungo Naismith. It was modelled on London's
famous St Martin's-in-the-Fields and was the city's first totally new
church since the Reformation.
Designed to reflect the wealth of the area, the plasterwork is among
the best of its period and was by Thomas Clayton. The enormous size of
the impressive portico gave Mungo Naismith nightmares. When the
scaffolding was removed from the building he spent several days and
nights pacing anxiously around the church searching for signs of
subsidence.
It is still standing, an inspiration for those planners,
conservationists, developers, and citizens who want to see Glasgow's
historic core fully regenerated.
After refurbishment, the church is likely to find a new use as a
concert hall or cultural centre.
''Restoring the church hinges on the completion of the housing
developments,'' says Ronnie McLetchie.
''Once people see that things are actually happening down here in St
Andrew's Square, then we'll see work firing ahead on the preservation of
the church.''

IN MODERN democratic societies it is the politician's job, it is part
of the political calling, to simplify big issues so that the man in the
street can understand them. This does not mean that the issues cease to
be complex. Nor, on the other hand, does it necessarily mean that they
are distorted. What distinguishes a politician above the run of gruesome
time-servers is his or her ability to reconcile simplicity with truth.
Readers may forgive my personal prejudices if I say that no British
politician has done that in recent years as well as Margaret Thatcher,
and she is still doing it today. To pass from the sublime to the
ridiculous, I find a different picture when I survey the Scottish
National Party, insofar as its outlook is represented in the views set
out in this newspaper's Open Forum last Thursday by its former leader,
William Wolfe.
The views are these. Scots want self-government. Scots have not got
it. Why? Because they feel guilt and shame at the Union, yet do not know
it because their emotions are repressed. Recognition of the guilt and
shame will allow them to be overcome. With one bound Scotland will be
free.
This is simple enough, but it breaks down at once when we probe
questions of truth. Why do Scots feel guilt and shame at the Union?
Because, according to Wolfe, their remote forefathers were scared into
it by the English. Fear in some form of England may be a constant in the
Scottish psyche -- not altogether an unhealthy one, since it makes Scots
always want to go one better than their neighbours. And the fear is in a
sense inevitable, England being a much bigger and more powerful country.
But if fear was the complete explanation, then it is hard to see how
Bannockburn, Flodden, and all the other battles could ever have been
fought. Scots would have cowered at home. Yet they did fight, even after
the Union. The rebellions of 1715 and 1745 may have been beaten in the
end, but they left the English looking pretty stupid. That is why they
are still recalled with some pride today.
In fact fear is an incomplete and wholly inadequate explanation. If
Wolfe wants to understand why, then he really should read the book that
has set off this controversy between us.* There he will find that the
situation facing Scotland in the years before 1707 was not simple but
exceedingly complex, and the range of potential responses European in
its implications.
The essential task was, after a series of disasters, to save a nation.
Yet it was not at all obvious how this might be done. One idea was to
restore the Stewarts. A second was to choose a Protestant king different
from the Elector of Hanover. A third was just to accept the Elector of
Hanover as King of Scots. A fourth was to accept him but impose
''limitations'', or binding constitutional constraints.
A fifth was to declare a republic. A sixth was to seek federal union
with England. A seventh was, because of the imbalance in any such union,
to have England break herself up into regions which would then be
federated with a Scotland and Ireland similarly broken up. An eighth was
to work towards a European federation on the same basis. A ninth was
incorporating union with England. And so on.
As ever, then, Scots in a scrape did not lack initiative or invention.
But no choice was clear-cut. Every one had as many drawbacks as
benefits. Nor, in trying to choose, could Scotland count on internal
unity. As Wolfe points out, she was divided by politics, religion,
language, and class, with each division productive of different
judgments about the future. Nine choices, four points of view: a formula
for at least 36 policies to fall out about. Some things in Scotland
never change.
The conclusion Wolfe draws from his observation is, all the same,
strange. ''A truly nationwide consciousness was not on the cards,'' he
says. This comes perilously close to denying that there was a Scottish
nation in 1707. What, after all, is a nation but a collection of people
who, beneath the many things that divide them, have, at a deeper level,
a common consciousness of belonging together?
It is, as a matter of fact, a perfectly respectable intellectual
position to hold, that the nation of Scotland had been formed by, rather
than despite, the Union. I am surprised to find the former leader of the
Scottish National Party subscribing to it, though I would not do so
myself.
On the contrary, I believe that there was a Scottish nation in 1707,
just as there had been since 1314, just as there is now. Obviously it is
not, with the march of history, the same nation as it always was. The
values it espouses today are, in some respects, directly contrary to
those it espoused, say, 100 years ago. But we can establish the organic
growth of new values out of old ones, and show beyond doubt that our
present is the product of our past. That is what national life is all
about.
One key to this particular national life is ambiguity. Scotland is
inescapably a small nation, not the complete master of her fate,
condemned to dwell always in the shadow of a larger one, yet capable, as
the past shows, of compensating for that and even turning it to
advantage.
This is a complicated situation. The best way of dealing with it is to
face up to the truth of it. At least, while Nationalist politicians like
William Wolfe evade that truth, their simplicities will be false.

Union of 1707.

NORTHERN Foods is fighting back after its heavy retrenchment which
resulted from the decline in doorstep milk deliveries and higher milk
prices.
Chairman Chris Haskins said yesterday the company intended to compete
vigorously and would not allow erosion of its market share. Part of the
#91m restructuring provisions is devoted to making the group more
competitive and Northern now intends to build market share in its
leading sectors.
Mr Haskins is also talking tough over milk prices, attacking the
''arbitrary means which the monopolistic Milk Marque can establish
prices.'' The dairy trade starts talks next month with Milk Marque about
future prices and Mr Haskins will be pressing for a cut from November.
Northern announced a plan to cut 3500 jobs last March and 2000
employees of those affected have left. The company also estimated its
full-year results, which are confirmed as profits of #119m before
exceptionals, down from #157m. Dividends are pegged at 8.8p, reflecting
the good balance sheet and strong cash flow, which has reduced gearing
to 44%.
The group is not quite so bearish as Unigate over delivered milk. Its
volume last year was down 12% against 17% for Unigate, while it sees the
market stabilising at around 30% against 25%. This reflects in part the
geographic concentration of the two groups, with Northern, as its name
suggests, bigger in the north of England.
Northern is market leader in supermarket milk and it managed to recoup
last November's milk price increase, though other costs, notably
packaging, rose and there was some erosion of prices toward the
year-end. Dairy trading profits were down 36% at #57m.
Apart from milk and dairy products, Northern has cut back its
delivered food operations to small corner shops and rationalised
speciality bread and meat products manufacturing. Savings of #20m are
seen this year, rising to #37m in 1997-98, though part will be absorbed
by continuing pressure on margins.
On the other hand, business with the big four food retailers is going
quite well with sales up 5%. Mr Haskins picked out cakes, biscuits,
recipe dishes, savoury foods, frozen food and speciality bread as areas
of sales growth.
However, overall demand for prepared foods like recipe dishes and pies
is weather sensitive. So sales were disappointing during last year's
warmer spells But with current temperaturew downright autumnal, they are
boomimg right now.
Convenience food profits were 24% lower at #34m.
The grocery side of the business was 12% up at #29.5m as Fox's
Biscuits powered ahead. More investment is going into this business. Two
price rises were obtained, though Northern said a third is needed to
keep pace with higher raw material costs.
Mr Haskins said the group had had a ''mildy encouraging'' start to the
current year but clearly it will take time for recovery to come through.
The shares lost 6p to 186p, where they sell at 12 times earnings and
yield 6%, a rating which should provide a cushion.

SHAREHOLDERS of Severn Trent are in line for a dividend boost as a
result of the decision by the water company to pay out #87m as an
efficiency bonus.
The group will pay a second interim dividend for 1994/95 and the
following four years of 3.84p, in addition to the normal interim and
final dividends. It has declared a final of 16.8p making a total of
25.03p, a rise of 10%.
Benefits from operational and capital spending efficiencies to be
shared between shareholders and customers. The latter will also benefit
by #87m over five years.
Severn Trent reported an underlying 15% increase in profits to #322.5m
in the year to March and the group is one of the few privatised
utilities to be making good profits from unregulated non-core
activities. These recorded a 41% rise in operating profits to #19.1m,
with the bulk coming from the waste disposal business Biffa, which made
#17.4m.
The group was attacked by its local customer service committee of the
industry watchdog, Ofwat, for not using more of the efficiency gains to
benefit customers. Committee chairman Clive Wilkinson said: ''The
customer has received around #70m over the last five years while the
shareholder has received #340m . . . benefit should now go to the
customer.''
Severn Trent responded by saying the package had been approved by
water regulator Ian Byatt, head of Ofwat.
Further productivity gains limited the rise in operating costs to 1.2%
and the financial position has improved because the capital spending
programme hs peaked. Operating profits from water and sewerage rose 12%
to #363m before a restructuring provision of #55m.
Biffa benefited from reorganisation and higher volumes. Severn shares
dipped 2p to 578p where they yield 6.2%.

INSURANCE broker C E Heath may float off its Datasure computer
subsidiary in a year's time. Chief executive Peter Presland suggested
Datasure is worth about #65m. That compares with Heath's own market
capitalisation of #148m after yesterday's 13p fall in the share price to
225p after disappointing results.
The share price gloom was reinforced by continuing pressure on premium
rates as the introduction of the premium tax has made many clients look
even harder at their insurance costs.
Pre-tax profits after excluding the previous year's exceptional losses
totalling #26.5m fell from #30.4m to #19.1m but the dividend total has
been maintained at 16p despite being slightly uncovered.
Insurance broking continues to be hard hit by the success of Direct
Line and its later imitators in the motor and household sectors in the
UK.
Wholesale re-insurance rates have fallen by between 15% and 20% in
January and Heath is trying to counter this blow through the development
of Premium Search. In the nine months to March, it sold 30,000 policies,
hopes for 100,000 this year, and says it is not at all fazed by the
emergence of Kwik-Fit Insurance as a head-on competitor. Premium Search
lost #4.3m in 1994-95 and does not expect breakeven until 1996-97.
A new area of business is unemployment mortgage protection to offset
financial services where the public remains suspicious.
So Heath is having to push harder overseas, particularly in the
developing world where there is lack of underwriting capacity which
means that the business is brought back to London where Heath gets two
sets of commission, broking and referral to underwriters.
It is effectively out of underwriting on its own account now that it
has agreed the disposal of its Australian interests in the shape of HIH.
Computer services, which had a turnover last year of #57m, achieved
profits of #6.5m and are growing as an activity with a rising number of
payroll accounts.

GROSS output in Scottish farming increased by #99m last year, due to a
large increase from the cropping sector and a smaller rise in the
livestock and livestock products sectors. The net worth of the industry
was just above #9000m in 1994. The 1995 edition of the Economic Report
on Scottish Agriculture, published by the Scottish Office, shows that on
most farm types net farm income increased or remained fairly stable in
1993-94.

HERE'S an interesting thought. ''The Edinburgh rental market is more
mature than that in Glasgow. In fact, I would say there are closer ties
in many ways between Edinburgh and London than with, say, Glasgow.''
Who says? Paul Mugnaioni says, and as boss of the Quality Street
rented housing operation, his views have to carry a lot of weight.
''It's simply that Edinburgh is a much longer established financial
centre,'' he explains, making it clear he is in no way patronising the
West of Scotland set-up.
''The situation in the East reflects to a large extent the overall
level of property values.''
In practical terms, it possibly means more rental properties on the
market in the East. And it possibly means slightly higher rental levels,
he adds.
''I certainly wouldn't draw any differences between people in the two
cities,'' he says. ''There may be more merchant bankers in Edinburgh,
and that kind of thing, but really the only variation in practice I see
is that tenancies in the East tend to be that bit longer than in the
West.
''People seem to be more accustomed to renting. There are not so many
people in-between buying decisions.''
With his business operating substantially throughout the UK, he can
compare views on rental needs in broad terms. Consistency of standards
gets top marks.
''It's a bit like moving between quality hotels,'' he says. ''When you
know you will have proper standards in furnishings, or maintenance, it
helps to make for a satisfied clientele.''
The range of properties available in Edinburgh at present does, in
fact, present an interesting cross-section of rental options. There are
some 80 QS flats and a further 12 managed for owners. In postal code
terms, they cover the EH12, EH10 and EH6 postal codeareas.
First off then, is a development at Slateford, known as Festival
Gardens, and providing one, two and three-bedroom flats. They are new
properties but in a traditional styling, stone-faced and spruce looking.
With a design that produced a flat area on top, a roof-top garden was
perhaps inevitable and deservedly popular, certainly in warmer weather.
The apartments have a designer kitchen, and the larger ones also have
an en suite shower room.
A vigorous stone's throw from Princes Street, Festival Gardens flats
range from #380 a month for a one-bedroom flat to #550 for a
three-bedroom, unfurnished.
Moving on to Newington, there are nine different styles, including
four penthouses with great views, including the Castle. This was a
refurbishing project, and proves its popularity by seldom having many
vacancies.
Prices for those available at St Patrick's Court range from #490 for a
two-bedroom flat unfurnished, to #565 furnished.
Leith keeps a sturdy independence in many respects, but manages to
attract developments, including the new Scottish Office project. Hardly
surprising then that there is a rental development here also, with one,
two and three-bedroom apartments. You have local shops and pubs and wine
bars, and Princes Street is just a Leith Walk away.
New Bells Court is the name. Flats come in at #475 for a furnished
one-bedroom property to #575 for an unfurnished three-bedroom. Kitchens
are right up to date and fitted out. Bedrooms have fitted wardrobes.
There's an internal courtyard as well.

MARY BRENNAN meets Jason Donovan whose acting career is reaching
nail-biting heights
JASON DONOVAN is the boy-next-door who, by his own account -- ''moved
out many years ago''. And no matter how often you try to steer him back
to Ramsay Street, or link his name -- and his personal life -- with
Kylie Minogue, Donovan will answer in a ''that was then, this is now''
mode. He will answer affably, and with adequate candour. Leading gambits
about his current girlfriend -- one Erica Baxter, I believe -- or
possible marriage plans elicit genial grins, non-committal shrugs and a
series of ''we'll sees'' and ''maybes'' tantalisingly topped off with
''I'm sort of that age you know. Getting closer to 30'' -- he is in fact
27.
Since he was in his teens Jason Donovan has been in limelight of one
hue or another, Golden-glowy follow-spots during his stint on
Neighbours, the Australian soap that made him internationally famous.
Rosy-tinted searchlights when he topped the pop charts with Kylie
Minogue amid rumours of their hot romance. Lurid, popping flash-flights
as -- yet again -- cameras snapped up possible indiscretions that blew
up in banner headlines. You might think that all this exposure would
have soured his disposition. Left him cynical, or maybe glib with
practised shallow chat. But no. Jason Donovan seems, disarmingly, to be
a genuinely nice guy. It's as if he has made up his mind that publicity
-- bad, as well as good -- comes with the territory of celebrity and
that being cussed, or acting supercilious won't make it any easier on
himself.
For the moment Donovan is on the promotional circuit for his new show,
Billy, which opens in Birmingham during August and ends its regional
tour at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre in mid-January 1996. Yesterday
was ''it's Tuesday -- it must be Edinburgh'' day on the schedule.
Eleven a.m., found Donovan -- fresh off the London shuttle --
cheerfully adopting ''top-of-the-world, Ma!'' attitudes on the
battlements of Edinburgh Castle. A battery of photographers issued a
hail of directions. Donovan obligingly straddled a cannon. The sun shone
grandly, crowds gathered curiously, Donovan gamely returned to the top
of the parapet . . . Somewhere in the background a hapless, helpful
soldier was having his pips squeaked for allowing Donovan on to the
historic wall . . . visitors to the castle are not, categorically, not
allowed to teeter perilously at great heights.
By now the number of photographers had more than doubled to include
passing tourists. ''Donovan?'' said a middle-aged Belgian. ''The folky
singer from the sixties?'' He looked at Jason's boyish good looks with
renewed respect. A few quick words to the wise and he was excitedly
rounding up his companions. The word Neighbours leapt out of a rapid
rattle of Flemish. There was a snappy chorus of clicking Nikons. And all
the while Jason Donovan was standing, sitting, talking and smiling as if
there was nothing else on earth he'd rather be doing.
Next port of call, a lunchtime press call -- an open forum for those
who had failed to secure one-to-one ''quality time'' later in the day.
This flagged up the background to Billy. Basically it's a musical
version of the Keith Waterhouse novel Billy Liar -- though with most of
the expletives deleted from the dialogue! The musical was first seen
back in 1974. Michael Crawford originally took the main part, while
Elaine Paige, Gay Soper and Diane Quick played the league of loyal,
long-suffering girlfriends. It proved a direct hit, running for over 900
performances.
Sadly the death of Peter Witt, its producer, led to complications over
rights and so Billy never left London on the expected tour. (Though
Edinburgh did see a version of it in 1992, when the National Youth
Theatre mounted a successful production on the Fringe.)
Now Billy has had something of an overhaul. New lyrics, new musical
arrangements, even three new songs specially written for Jason Donovan
by the creative team of John Barry and Don Black. While we are fed these
various facts, Donovan takes the opportunity to swallow a couple of
sandwiches and down a gulp or three of frothy coffee. For the next
half-hour he answers questions about the production, his personal life,
his past and even his peccadilloes. At no time is he abrasive. At no
time does he actually dodge the issue. Wherever possible he tries to
make the response lighthearted but even so he doesn't set out to play
the air-head. It's obvious that he has conscientiously prepared himself
for Billy and not merely by acquiring a Yorkshire accent -- though he
declines to give us a sample of his dialect.
While the assembled hacks and hackets relapsed over their sandwiches,
Donovan vanished into the hinterlands of the Festival Theatre for a
gruelling schedule of individual interviews. My personal bite was
slotted in for 2.30. By then I expected to find a frazzled automaton,
spouting out routine answers. Instead Donovan appeared, hastily chomping
a slice of chocolate cake and grinning as if he'd been caught raiding
the larder. In conversation he comes over as thoughtful and possibly
shyer than he cares to appear.
He's aware of the image that he has carried forward from those
Neighbour days. He accepts that it has brought benefits. It did, after
all, give him a foothold on his current career ladder. But he has
ambitions that go way beyond being ''some cheesy pop thing from the
eighties.'' He recently filmed a docu-drama The Last Bullet, set among
the trenches of the last war. When he talks about it it's clear that he
found the acting an interesting challenge and the process of filming a
real buzz. He re-enacts the whole business of setting up angles, the
excitement of capturing an exact moment. He's animated, articulate. This
may well be the future career direction.
In the meantime he's happy to talk about the role in hand. No, he
doesn't see himself like Billy -- ''for one thing, I'm not that kind of
a liar. And I don't live in a fantasy world. I've never deluded myself.
People have tended to put me down. When that happens I tend to go behind
the door and say 'stuff you' and then do something about it. Billy tends
to go behind the door and do nothing . . .''
Despite the put-downs, despite his brushes with the press -- and he
draws attention to those of his own accord -- Donovan maintains he
hasn't lost his faith in humanity. His real trust, seems to be, mostly
in himself. He studies fingernails that are bitten to the quick, and
thinks carefully before saying that he's never regretted being Jason
Donovan. ''Fed up? Yeah, of course. But I've put enough effort into
being what I am to be able to enjoy the benefits. And if it all came
crashing down tomorrow I would still go ahead and have a good life.''
It's no fantasy, it's no lie.
Billy is at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre from January 15 to February
3, 1996. Booking is now open.

<HEADLINE>Stamp prices frozen as Post Office makes record profit</HEADLINE>

THE Post Office yesterday froze the price of first and second class
stamps until March, after revealing a record pre-tax profit of #472m for
1994-95.
However, the nine-month price standstill failed to impress the main
post consumer group -- and postal union leaders.
The Post Office Users' National Council, which objected when the Royal
Mail put 1p on stamps in November 1993, said the freeze was no more than
customers deserved and should continue well beyond March.
Communication Workers' Union leaders said overworked, poorly-paid
postmen and sorters should reap the rewards of the Post Office's
success.
Post Office bosses were disappointed when a Government privatisation
plan was blocked by MPs last year. They warned that foreign and private
rivals would steal business and damage profitability if the organisation
was not given commercial freedom.
However, Labour said the Post Office's ability to improve
significantly on its #306m profits for 1993-94 proved that privatisation
was not needed.
''These figures confirm that the Post Office is a major success story
within the public sector,'' said shadow trade spokesman Brian Wilson.
''They make one wonder afresh why so much time was wasted on discussing
privatisation.''
However, the Post Office chairman, Mr Michael Heron, said the
President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, had loosened the
financial shackles that Government ownership imposed on the
organisation.
He denied the Post Office had been ''crying wolf'', saying that rivals
would be sure to damage the Post Office within the next few years unless
the group was given the freedom to invest and develop. ''All the
component parts of the problems that we foresaw are there today,'' he
added. ''What we are being condemned to is a restricted market.''
The Post Office annual report showed that the group contributed #235m
to Government funds in 1994-95.
Royal Mail achieved pre-tax profits of #449m, Post Office Counters
recorded pre-tax profits of #30m but Parcelforce -- which is most under
threat from rival delivery firms -- recorded a pre-tax loss of #11m.
The rest of the profit came from items such as TV licences and other
subscription services.

IT WAS off to Dublin for the Diary at the behest of Aer Lingus. We
should point out that airlines are forever flying journalists,
politicians, and opinion-makers to exotic locations to witness new
developments in the world of aviation.
Whether it be the official opening of a new transit lounge in Kuala
Lumpur or the hanselling of a luggage carousel in Bogota, the chaps from
the Fourth Estate, the Third Estate, and any Old Estate will be there.
The reason for our day in Dublin was to try out Aer Lingus's new
BAe146 jet. We can report that it takes off beautifully from Glasgow,
lands just dandily in Dublin, and the girls with the trolleys still
manage to feed you grub and two drinks during the 35-minute flight.
There were no new luggage carousels to see at Dublin airport but Aer
Lingus showed us their flight simulator training centre. It is an
absolutely fascinating place which we really must tell you about
sometime.
Meanwhile, we asked our Aer Lingus man, Maurice Rochford, was there
any chance of simulating a pint of Guinness in a few of Dublin's fine
public houses? There was indeed and he had laid on the services of two
actors, Derek and Paul, who specialise in bringing to life the literary
history of the city's finest hostelries.
The two silver-tongued thesps enact great gobbets of James Joyce,
Brendan Behan, and Flann O'Brien and all you have to do is listen and
drink your stout. The chaps tell a rake of anecdotes, most of which we
cannot remember. This seems entirely appropriate since the pubs in
question are where Behan, O'Brien and Co journeyed into oblivion.
There was one story we can almost recall. It's about a dead donkey's
donger (we think that's what he said) which becomes detached by some
prankster and is thrown into the garden of a nunnery. The sight of it
causes some alarm to the sisters. The story ends, we think, with the
mother superior exclaiming, on seeing the item in question: ''Would you
look at what the Protestants have done to Father Slattery.''
But back to the Aer Lingus BAe146. It is an awfully nice plane with
two wings, two engines, and quite a lot seats. So many seats, in fact,
that they have been able to reduce the price of their flights from
Glasgow to Dublin to as low as #59.
This reduction is only because of the new plane and has nothing at all
to do with the success of the Ryanair Prestwick-Dublin flights from as
low as #49. If I were to suggest such a thing, they might never invite
me to see the new Guinness fount at the airport in Cork and the Diary's
career as aviation specialist will be over.
* While in Ireland we were interested to read of the parish priest in
Newbridge, County Clare, who has had to apologise for a sexist article
in his church newsletter. It referred to women as ''very effective
cleaning agents, highly ornamental, especially in cars''.
Women, it added, ''are dangerous except in experienced hands and it is
illegal to possess more than one, although several could be maintained
at different locations as long as specimens do not come into direct
contact with each other''. The priest is obviously bishop material,
except he claims he has no idea who wrote the article.
* From Cork we hear news of construction of a new crematorium, only
the second in the Republic. Choice of location for this new facility?
The Ovens district of the city.
Blotted history
AN outbreak of honesty in the programme for Lilias Day at Kilbarchan,
Renfrewshire. A Paisley printing company used its half-page advert to
admit: ''Greenlaw Graphics has been in business for 11 years and during
that time we have pleased and displeased our customers, not been paid
for jobs, lied to, been cheated and conned, suffered problems with the
tax department, been flooded, broken into on many occasions, been forced
to move premises, had power cuts, deliveries of incorrect stock, and
printed jobs in the wrong colour.
''It isn't easy, and the only reasons we're in business is to see what
happens next. Pop in and see us. At least the coffee's good.''
Ah, the joys of having your own business.
Chantytown
THE Diary is pleased to act as a sorting house for the inevitable
occurrence in our own dear Herald of misprints, or errors in
transmission as we now call them, since that fudges the issue quite
nicely and transfers the blame into a technological no man's land.
There was an error in transmission in yesterday's interview with the
venerable folkies and rockers Gallagher and Lyle who are to be in
concert in Glasgow on July 2. We said the boys would be accompanied by
the Shanty Dykes Ceilidh Band from their home town of Largs.
Which made the above band sound as if it is a bunch of wimmin who sing
songs of the sea. It should have read the Chanty Dykes Ceilidh Band,
named after a wall in Largs where locals were wont to dispose of
brimming chanties.
Who would have thought Largs had a dedicated location for timming the
po?
The Name Game
ONE of the lecturers at an upcoming local government seminar on the
Internet, the hi-tech communication system, is one Dr Donald Morse of
Edinburgh University.
PR Name Game
A NEW group has been set up to promote the Scottish tomato-growing
industry. It is called Scotland's Tomatoes. Which sounds catchy but
doesn't quite have the same power and appeal of ''It's Scotland's Oil''.
0All at sea
WE will return tomorrow to our analysis of the Auld Alliance but have
room today for only a brief tale of how a little knowledge of French can
be a dangerous thing. Charles Fryars of Lauder, Berwickshire, tells of a
trip to France undertaken to improve the linguistic skills of pupils of
the old St Mungo's school in Glasgow.
The party were staying in a hostel in Paris where it was discovered
that they were a mattress short for the beds.
The teacher in charge dispatched a spotty youth to obtain one from the
concierge. He returned with no mattress but a well-cuffed ear which he
had earned by saying to the surprised and outraged lady: ''Madame, je
voudrais un matelot, s'il vous plait.''

THE head of Scotland's major meat company returned from the south of
France yesterday confident that he had secured new markets for beef and
lamb.
Raymond Wight, executive director of Scotch Premier meat, conducted a
promotional campaign for 500 top restaurant owners and retail butchers
in the Cote d'Azur which is to be followed by major promotions in 12
stores in the south of France.
The new sales drive follows the successful launch of Scotch Premier at
an international food fair in Paris last October and the subsequent
appointment of a sales development officer in Paris.
''We are confident that we can secure a larger share of the European
market where discerning consumers are prepared to pay premium prices for
quality Scotch beef and lamb produced to a consistently high
standard,''he said.
Scotch Premier already has regular shipments of beef and lamb to
France, Italy, Belgium, and Holland and aims to double export sales over
the coming season from #5m to #10m plus.
''There is still tremendous scope in Europe for a product that is
traditionally beef bred and reared,'' Mr Wight said.
Scottish meat exporters are well aware that they continue to face
competition from long-established suppliers such as Argentina and that
they must gain sales more on quality than price .
With its facilities at Inverurie and Edinburgh, Scotch Premier has
annual sales of #70m and sees expansion on the Continental European
front as vital to its farmer members.
It is understood that while many beef producers have successfully
geared their breeding and fattening regimes toward satisfying the
Continental market, too many lamb producers still fail to produce the
leaner meat that is desired in France and Italy.
Mr Wight said: ''Consumers throughout the world, and particularly
Europe, recognise the quality of what is produced in Scotland.
''There is a niche market still untapped and through our Paris and
Milan-based offices we intend to develop our export initiatives.''
Along with other meat exporters the group is keen to make greater
inroads into the Far Eastern markets and sees the establishment of its
reputation for consistent quality to European purchasers as a key link
in the development of world trade.

AFTER the near-euphoria which greeted the 2.4% rise in Land
Securities' net asset value last month, British Land and Great Portland
Estates took the stuffing out of the market yesterday when both emerged
with lower-than-expected values and cautious noises about near-term
prospects.
To be sure, John Ritblat's British Land did see an improvement but of
only 0.7% to 421p per share against hopes of around 430p. But there was
a touch of encouragement with the dividend total rising 7.8% to 8.12p
although earnings showed a mere 2.6% gain to 11.8p.
Assets have risen by 54% to #3444m as at the end of March, helped by
the acquisition of Stanhope Properties and its 50% share of Broadgate
Properties. This is the key to substantial rental growth over the next
two or three years as there are signs that City rentals are improving,
underpinned by the rise in values in the area of 3.2%.
The impact of this acquisition of a 50% share of two million square
feet development for #125m, with pre-emption rights over the other half
from the receivers of Rosehaugh, has helped boost the current annualised
rent roll from #157m to #237m.
Mr Ritblat says he is considering the longer-term strategy for the
property. However, there is little risk of a call on shareholders given
that there are bank facilities untouched of and cash totalling #630m
even if a Broadgate deal would push gearing towards 100% from the
current 80% while interest cover is a relatively comfortable 1.5 times.
British Land has been one of the most active in the re-shaping of its
portfolio with a subtantial exposure to Sainsbury supermarkets. It was
quick on its feet with the deal with the George Soros Quantum Fund which
enabled acquisitions to be made in the depths of the market depression
including Orchard House in Edinburgh.
Property is in an upward trend, Mr Ritblat says, and political and
economic difficulties both in Britain and abroad should not be confused
with the underlying strength of UK real estate as the fundamental asset.
The shares dropped 16p to 395p where they stand at a 6.2% discount to
year-end net asset value which looks a little toppy. The yield is 2.5%
Great Portland shares eased 4p to 175p after chairman Richard Peskin
said that net assets had fallen 2.9% to 203p. The company has been
active in acquisitions spending #108m in the year throughout the UK,
including the #9m purchase of the Regent Centre in Aberdeen for #9m for
an 8.4% yield. The property is let to Sidlaw.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled from #24.5m to #53.1m, helped in
part to an immediate #8.7m gain being made when an interest rate swap
with Barings became effective when the bank went under in February.
The dividend total has been raised 9% to 8.75p for an attractive 6.25%
yield and the shares look interesting as retail rents in its traditional
Oxford Street area are looking somewhat healthier. The discount to net
asset value is 13.8%.

Singer/actor Jason Donovan had all Edinburgh at his feet yesterday as
he perched on the castle ramparts to promote his forthcoming appearance
in the musical Billy, which tours England in the autumn before opening
at the Festival Theatre in January. The Australian entertainer, who has
appeared in Edinburgh before, said he was looking forward to returning
to the city he had come to love. Billy is based on the Keith Waterhouse
novel Billy Liar, later made into a film with Tom Courtney. -- Arts

AFTER the traumas of the last six months, former Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
marketing and advertising group Cordiant is clearing the decks to try to
rebuild the business.
That is after the loss of major clients and senior executives
following the departure of Maurice Saatchi who had refused to accept a
lesser role than chairman. But, as acting chairman and chief executive
Mr Charlie Scott told the annual general meeting yesterday, the first
since the change of name, it is bound to be a long haul. Replacing major
accounts is a long-term process. There is no short cut.
In the meantime, the focus for the group is on restoring its
short-term performance and bringing the company into line with reduced
revenue. Inevitably this means wielding the knife, and this Cordiant is
doing. Staff numbers worldwide are being reduced by 470 (of which over
410 have already gone), around 130 from the London operations, which
will mean an exceptional severance cost of about #10m.
In addition, there is a non-cash goodwill write-off on the sale
earlier this year of Cordiant's third advertising network Campbell
Mithun Esty. This will effect the profit-and-loss account but not
shareholders' funds.
Together, the two items total of about #25m and will mean a first-half
loss when the results are reported on August 8. The second half, while
showing lower revenue, is forecast to show an improvement in
profitability compared to the second half of 1994 when profits amounted
to just over #17m before tax.
Despite the decline in revenue, the target is to improve operating
margins before the exceptional severance costs by about one percentage
point over 1994's 5.7%. This the company considers achievable.
Major client losses for Cordiant included British Airways, Mars,
Dixons and Gallaher. All of them, except Mars, moving to the new M&amp;C
Saatchi, formed by Maurice Saatchi and his brother Charles.
Mr Scott told the meeting that major client losses connected with the
events of the first part of this year, on an annualised basis, amounted
to 6% of revenue but have now ceased. It has not all been downhill. New
assignments from existing clients, including BAT, Johnson &amp; Johnson,
Kingfisher and Proctor &amp; Gamble, have added 3% to revenue so far this
year.
Cordiant, though, needs to pick up new clients to make up for its
losses. This is clearly, as Mr Scott indicated, not going to be easy.
Yet world advertising expenditure is growing strongly with major brand
name businesses making clear that advertising budgets have to be
substantially raised in the increasingly competitive international
market place.
Cordiant, through its continuing Saatchi franchise, must ensure that
it gets its slice of the cake. At the moment, it does not appear to be
doing so. This is probably acceptable for the time being given the
hassle it has and, to a certain extent, still is undergoing. But soon
the market will expect to see solid evidence that the company is back on
keel, reflected in major new clients and growing revenue.
The decision last month to end legal wrangling with the Saatchi
brothers and their colleagues who had left with them was clearly the
right one even though Cordiant looked to have a good case in some
instances. It would, though, not just have been a distraction, albeit a
big one, but also extremely expensive. Shareholders might have been less
than enthusiastic at the prospect of possibly years of expensive
litigation.
Appointments to make up for the key figures who have departed continue
to be made and Mr Scott has no intention of keeping the dual roles of
acting chairman and chief executive any longer than necessary.
The international search for a senior executive to complement the rest
of the executive directors and bring to the table first-hand experience
that meets the needs of multinational clients is said to be progressing
well.
Cordiant's share price firmed just 3p to 104p but are unlikely to move
far until the market is convinced the act is truly falling into place.

ISLE of Man-based Shoprite, whose deep-discounting invasion of
Scotland came to a catastrophic end last year, yesterday revealed that
the disposal of its UK food retailing operations to arch-rival Kwik Save
had cost it #15m.
Shoprite, whose shares dramatically collapsed from last February's
closing high of 241p and are currently trading at only 7p, does not
expect to meet its target of redeeming #15m worth of Preference shares
by the end of this year.
However, it hopes to make up the current shortfall of about #7m
through the disposal of non-core assets on the Isle of Man and in the
UK.
And joint managing director David Webster claimed there was no danger
of Shoprite going into receivership.
Shoprite's results for the 61 weeks to January 1 reveal a loss on
November's sale to Kwik Save of 117 deep-discounting stores and sites,
about 100 of them in Scotland, of #15m.
During the period, the Isle of Man group incurred an operating loss of
#8.74m on its UK discount retailing operations, after hefty refinancing
costs were taken into account.
After exceptionals, Shoprite made a pre-tax loss of #29.2m during the
61-week period, after a profit of #5.08m in the year to end-October
1993. Not surprisingly, it is paying no dividend.
Turnover from the UK food retailing business was actually higher, at
#190m. After adjusting for the effect of the extended accounting period,
Shoprite achieved modest sales growth in the Isle of Man.
However, turnover on the island was less than one-fifth of that in the
UK at #34.9m.
Kwik Save paid about #50m for its rival's entire UK retail business
and has been busy in recent weeks converting former Shoprite stores to
its own format.
Shoprite yesterday claimed that a lack of support from its bankers had
severely weakened its negotiating position when seeking potential
purchasers and directly impacted on the ultimate selling price.
The Nicholson family, which formed Shoprite more than two decades ago,
previously worked for Kwik Save.
The late Ken Nicholson, the father of Shoprite executive chairman
Deryck Nicholson and managing director Ian Nicholson, founded Kwik Save
with Albert Gubay prior to retiring to the Isle of Man as a result of
ill-health and forming a rival group. Deryck and Ian Nicholson also
worked for Kwik Save.
Shoprite, which has eight supermarkets, one retail wine warehouse and
a Mercedes-Benz dealership on the Isle of Man, is to slash its board to
a size more in keeping with the scale of its remaining operations.
Deryck and Ian Nicholson, who between them own a majority stake in
Shoprite, will continue in their present roles.
Mr Webster is one of five executive directors who will step down after
Shoprite's annual general meeting later this month, although he will
retain a general management role. Group chief accountant Martin Poole
will replace Michael Pridham as finance director.
Commenting on the shortfall relating to the redemption of Preference
shares, Mr Webster said Shoprite was in agreement with these
shareholders and was endeavouring to dispose of certain non-core assets.
The proposed disposals of a shopping centre and business and
residential development land on the Isle of Man, as well as four
properties in the UK, should supplement the #5m cash already put aside
and the remaining #3m due from Kwik Save as it concludes the takeover of
the former Shoprite stores.
Meanwhile, Shoprite blamed its UK demise on ''very aggressive
pricing'' of value ranges by major supermarket chains such as Tesco,
Safeway and Asda.
Shoprite will certainly not be inviting UK shoppers to overfill their
trollies and underspend their budgets for a long time, if ever.
The deal with Kwik Save freezes Shoprite out of Scotland, England and
Wales for five years.

A SHERIFF who received #40,000 for her share of the matrimonial home
after the break-up of her marriage is entitled to a second payout when
the house is sold, a judge ruled yesterday.
Lord Cullen rejected a claim that Miss Susan Raeburn QC had waived any
right to the Edinburgh property, which was valued at #80,000 in 1984.
Miss Raeburn, who sits as a sheriff in Strathclyde, married Edinburgh
solicitor James Gardner in March 1983 and, in January of the following
year, they bought a house in Braid Avenue for #80,000.
The house was conveyed to the couple ''equally between them and to the
survivor of them'' (the survivorship clause).
They separated in November 1985 and were divorced the following
September. It was arranged that Mr Gardner would pay Miss Raeburn
#40,000 to acquire her share of the family home.
By a disposition registered in February 1986, Miss Raeburn, in return
for the #40,000 paid by her husband, made over to him and his executors
her ''whole right title and interest, present and future'' in the family
home.
Mr Gardner died in 1991 and his executors now wish to sell the house.
Miss Raeburn contended that she was entitled to a share in the proceeds
because of the survivorship clause.
The executors claimed that, in 1986, she had given up not only her
half share in the home but also her whole right title and interest,
present and future, in her husband's half share.
They argued that, by granting the disposition in 1986, Miss Raeburn
had waived any rights she might have had in her late husband's half
share and that, from that date, Mr Gardner was owner of the house free
from the terms of the survivorship clause in the 1984 deed.
They asked Lord Cullen to declare that they were the owners of the
house at Braid Avenue and that Miss Raeburn, of Ramsay Garden, also in
Edinburgh, had no right, title or interest in it.
The judge said yesterday that the issue was whether, on Mr Gardner's
death, Miss Raeburn became entitled to his half share of the property
because of the survivorship clause.
Miss Raeburn's position was that, on a proper reading of the 1986
agreement, she had given up only her half share in the house and not her
late husband's half share.
Lord Cullen said this argument was well-founded and dismissed the
executor's case.

A FORMER bank worker told a murder trial at the Old Bailey yesterday
that her ex-boyfriend, the father of her child, had confessed to the
killing of a young Scottish soldier in a failed robbery attempt.
Miss Samira Manassib, 24, who was living in Windley Close, Forest
Hill, south-east London, at the time, said Mr Roger Medford, 25, had
tried to contact her repeatedly days after the killing.
Moroccan-born Miss Manassib said she had heard on the newsabout the
murder in the Seven Sisters Road, Tottenham, north London, on July 29
last year. She eventually met up with Mr Medford at a hamburger bar,
where he told her he and his brother, Mr Kevin Medford, who is not
before the court, had set out to rob soldier Scott van Nuill.
Mr van Nuill, 21, a craftsman with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers, from Penicuik, near Edinburgh, had become involved in
smuggling cocaine into Britain.
While stationed in Germany, he and friend Corporal James Brown, who
both used cannabis, had bought a consignment of cocaine from their
supplier, former soldier Neville Medford, the defendant's brother.
The initial plan was for Mr van Nuill to meet Mr Brown in London but
that was changed and a rendezvous was arranged with Mr Neville Medford,
who lives in Germany.
However, it is alleged that Mr Neville Medford tipped off his two
brothers Roger and Kevin, in England, and a plot to double cross Mr van
Nuill and Mr Brown was formulated.
That plan backfired, it is alleged, when Mr van Nuill put up a fight
when Roger and Kevin Medford tried to rob him in the street.
The court was told he was stabbed three times, one wound piercing his
heart, as his attackers tried to wrestle the bag of cocaine from him,
and he died on the way to hospital.
Mr Roger Medford denies murder and robbery.
Miss Manassib, a former bank worker, told the court she met Mr Roger
Medford in 1988 and, when she was 19, gave birth to his son. Their
romance disintegrated after that, although they maintained contact with
each other as friends.
She said that when she met Mr Roger Medford at Turnpike Lane, north
London, ''he explained why he had been trying to reach me''.
''He explained the murder that had occurred in Seven Sisters,'' she
said.
Asked by Mr John Nutting, QC, for the prosecution, what he had said
about the incident Miss Manassib replied: ''That he was there.''
She went on: ''He said it was a robbery that had gone wrong.''
Mr Nutting: ''Who were the robbers?''
Miss Manassib: ''Him (Roger) and his brother Kevin.''
Mr Nutting: ''What did he say had happened? Was there a fight,
argument or disagreement?''
Miss Manassib: ''I can't remember exactly. The words he used were a
few nicks given with the knife and the guy fell.
''He said he did it.''
The trial continues.

THE great questions of American politics, which are not the same as
deciding who will win the next presidential election, are the future of
affirmative action and Medicare. These are issues that people get really
excited about, and the way they are decided will determine what sort of
a country we will have in the next century.
The idea behind affirmative action was that black Americans had
suffered discrimination over the years , and that the quickest way to
raise blacks up to white levels was to give them special treatment in
education and jobs.
Affirmative action went a step further. It included busing -- putting
black children into buses and sending them off to predominantly white
schools, and putting white children into buses and sending them to black
schools. It prescribed that companies and bureaucracies and government
operations should go out and hire blacks, even if they were less
qualified than whites.
In many respects, affirmative action has been an outstanding success.
There are now blacks on every level of the professions, and in just
about every category of job all around the country. The advantages were
extended to Hispanics and women, to their great benefit.
There are, of course, some glaring follies. Women don't make good
firemen, for instance. It's simply a matter of size and strength. All
the same, for several years the New York courts were tied up by a small
number of women trying to force the city fire department to give them
jobs. Women kept failing the test until at last the standards were
lowered sufficiently.
Affirmative action was extended to favouring minorities in business.
In many places (including Washington) the rules state that a proportion
of all public contracts must be given to minority businesses.
This led to much abuse: many of these supposedly minority businesses
turned out to be fronts, with a black man as chairman -- but the real
managers, and owners, were white men in suits.
On Monday the Supreme Court sharply reduced the application of
affirmative action, stating that federal programmes to give business to
minorities in preference to whites are only permissible if they fulfil a
''compelling governmental interest''.
Black businesses, and those run by Hispanics and women, too, will now
have to compete strictly on merit, and there is little doubt that very
many of them -- the genuine ones as well as the front operations -- will
fail.
What about schools? Busing itself is being phased out in many places,
because it has so obviously failed: schools are as segregated now as
they were in 1954, by choice of residence, and busing has merely annoyed
white parents immensely.
That is the key to it: there is a huge resentment that minorities and
women are being favoured beyond their merits. It is agreed that there
are some cases where it is essential to bring in blacks: Los Angeles
burned four years ago because its black community distrusted the police.
The answer is to appoint more black policemen, whatever their scores on
the tests.
The Republicans have observed that attacking affirmative action is
very popular, and are using it as a means of undermining Democratic
support in middle and lower-class white America.
The Democrats have yet to find a way of responding: President Clinton
has promised a review of the whole issue. If the party admits the
failures and unpopularity of affirmative action, it will lose its black
support. If it doesn't, it loses white support.
The other key issue, Medicare, turns around how much money should be
spent on pensioners' health. Newt Gingrich, in a debate with Bill
Clinton on Sunday, got the President to admit that Medicare spending
must be brought under control before it bankrupts us all. That battle is
not yet decided: the Democrats insist that the Republicans, in their
passion to balance the budget, will hurt pensioners.
They are undoubtedly right -- and pensioners are the biggest voting
bloc in the country. It would be paradoxical if, over the next few
years, the white working classes move into the Republican camp,
believing that the Democrats unjustly favour minorities, while elderly
people, who are mostly relatively affluent, go Democratic.
But it's more than that: will America continue its sometimes
successful, sometimes not, effort to reduce racial inequalities on every
level of society, or leave minorities behind in the dust? And will it
continue to transfer very large sums to the unproductive old, to the
detriment of everyone else? At the moment, it looks as though the answer
to each question is yes.

A LEADING Scottish child protection agency, severely criticised by
Lord Clyde over its involvement in the Orkney child sex abuse case, has
defended its strong endorsement of a survey which claims that one in six
adults were sexually abused as children.
Health Minister John Bowis yesterday dismissed the survey by the
NSPCC, claiming it risked spreading ''undue alarm''. He also called for
a ''level-headed approach'' to fighting abuse.
However, Children 1st, formerly known as the Royal Scottish Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, has called for greater efforts to
protect children from abuse, co-inciding with the results of the survey
by its sister charity.
The NSPCC claims that one in six adults were subjected to some kind of
sexual interference when they were children.
Mr Douglas Turner, Children 1st's public affairs manager, yesterday
defended the charity's decision to endorse the survey despite the fact
that its role now concentrated on cruelty prevention rather than
protection.
The RSSPCC became known as Children 1st in March this year as part of
a radical switch in strategy and operations.
The reorganisation came after Lord Clyde's criticism of the RSSPCC's
methods in interviewing nine Orkney children taken into care and
returned home five weeks later. Subsequently the charity's annual income
fell from #2.7m to #2m.
Mr Turner said yesterday: ''The Orkney case was a peculiar situation
and bears no relationship whatsoever to the findings of this latest
research.
''We are in no way being alarmist. One of the problems we face in our
campaigning work is the lack of understanding on the extent of child
abuse.
''These findings are based on the responses of individuals and are not
the work or creation of either the NSPCC or Children 1st.''
The NSPCC survey said one in six adults claimed to have been sexually
molested during their childhood.
However, more than half of them failed to tell anyone at the time
because they were frightened they would not be believed and one in three
still felt unable to talk about their ordeal, the survey showed.
The NSPCC said the findings showed that the abuse was happening to an
''unacceptable extent'' and claimed it raised fundamental questions
about the quality of support and protection given to youngsters. Of 1032
adults, aged 18 to 45, questioned in Scotland, England, and Wales, 168
(16%) claimed to have been abused.
Their experiences ranged from rape, attempted rape or buggery (4%), to
indecent exposure, almost 10%. However, for two-thirds of the victims it
involved some physical contact with the abuser.
Of the victims, 57% were women and 43% were men. One in three were
molested before the age of 11.
While almost three in 10 were able to stop the abuser's behaviour by
telling an adult, 32% only halted the abuse by avoiding the molester or
by leaving home.
Mr Arthur Wood, chief executive of Children 1st, said yesterday that
the research confirmed the charity's fear that abuse was widespread and
caused much suffering and lasting damage.
Mr Christopher Brown, NSPCC director, said the findings showed that
support for children who had suffered abuse was ''severely lacking''.
''Reports considering the well-being and treatment of children today
abound,'' he said. ''But action is needed at individual, community, and
state level.''
The survey is timed to coincide with an NSPCC campaign for immediate
action to protect youngsters.
The charity is calling on the Government to implement fully the UN
Convention on Children's Rights and set up a national commissioner for
children.
The Health Minister, Mr Bowis, said: ''Successful child protection
needs to be sharply focused on children at risk, not clouded by emotion
and headline-grabbing figures.
''By suggesting that abuse is this widespread, there is a danger that
attention could be diverted from serious child-abuse cases.''
Mr Bowis added: ''Today's survey by the NSPCC is based on a wide
definition of 'sexual interference' and the way it was researched and
compiled is unclear. Broad definitions and untested statistics risk
'crying wolf'.''
Ms Anne Stafford, a research officer with Children 1st, said the
research confirmed the need for support services that were sympathetic
to the needs of children and their families and which were readily
accessible.
She said the charity tried to provide such services through its family
resource centres in Ross-shire, Dundee, Edinburgh, Selkirk, and Glasgow,
while admitting that much more could be done with increased resources.
Children 1st is to launch a major fund-raising campaign this year to
help it increase the level of services it provides.

THE disposal of radioactive waste at Dounreay has been a disgrace.
What is more, it has been a secret disgrace, hidden from the public and
characterised by the obsessive secrecy and intolerant arrogance which
has marked so much of the leadership of Dounreay's interaction with
anyone who failed to share their nuclear zeal. Worse, they have been
allowed to get away with it by the Atomic Energy Authority who should
have known better, who probably did know better, but who omitted to do
anything positive about it. The report yesterday by the Government's
Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC) makes abundantly
clear the folly of successive past management policies at Dounreay. The
shaft which was dug near the clifftops and which was used as a
repository for nuclear waste (some of it, according to our information,
packed in nothing more secure than cardboard drums) is and always was
utterly unsuitable for the task. Nearly 20 years ago the shaft exploded,
hurling radioactive contamination on to the surrounding cliff. It
exploded because someone who did not deserve even a Standard Grade
chemistry qualification put sodium and potassium into its damp interior.
The resulting explosion was as predictable as everything else about this
sorry tale.
At this point the Atomic Energy Authority enters the story with its
investigation of the explosion and its statement that surface
contamination had been cleaned up. The AEA produced a report which
satisfied the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate and there the matter
ended. The report, needless to say, was never published. We know now
that it was worthless. Far from cleaning up the nuclear pollution on the
clifftop, Dounreay appears to have missed most of it. Yesterday's report
cites it as a likely source for the radioactive pollution which
continues to appear on the beach, probably by erosion of the polluted
cliff above. Nor is there much doubt that pollution gets on to the beach
from the shaft by other means. It is, after all, dug into nothing more
substantial than flagstone which, although hard in itself, splits easily
in horizontal section. The best estimate now is that the appalling
radioactive cocktail which lurks inside that shaft must somehow be
removed and dealt with safely within the next 100 years. If it is not
rendered safe within that time the consequences are likely to be dire.
The technical problems involved in this necessary task are
understandably great. The sum of money necessary is likely to be
substantial. Nevertheless the job must be done. It is simply intolerable
to leave this corroding, radioactive pustule of a shaft in existence for
one minute longer than is strictly necessary, and in this respect the
demand by the authors of yesterday's report, that the situation be
evaluated and a solution proposed with a timetable for action, must be
fulfilled.
It should be clear by now that the story of Dounreay is one of
betrayal of the industry, of the workers of the industry, and of the
people of this country who were repeatedly assured that everything was
just fine. Two conclusions, apart from those admirably enclosed in
yesterday's report, are now inevitable. The cult of secrecy which has
surrounded, shielded, and protected the nuclear industry in this country
must be removed. There are no official secrets which need to be
protected. Nor, despite privatisation's embrace of the sector, is there
any justification for the sensitivity of commercial information to be
used as an excuse for more secrecy. After all, what competitor would be
eager to steal the secret of Dounreay's radioactive waste disposal
techniques? It might also be useful to ask if Dounreay can still be
regarded as a suitable site for its current task of reprocessing spent
nuclear fuel.
The second inevitable conclusion is more difficult. Dounreay has been
cleared as a possible element in the cluster of leukemia cases which
occur in Caithness. That conclusion was reached in good faith by highly
professional investigators who assessed the likely risks using a
significant amount of information supplied by the Atomic Energy
Authority and Dounreay. It is clear now that, given the utter disarray
at Dounreay and the dubious nature of its estimates and figures, this
evaluation must be re-examined. The researchers involved are clearly
disturbed and believe that their report may be diminished. They want to
know if there is any evidence which they do not know about, and if there
is they must be told. It is difficult to be other than deeply angry at
this affair, at the successive past management regimes at Dounreay, but
also at Government regulatory bodies who should have monitored and
protected the public, but who have most signally failed in their task.

Enterprising minds are at work behind an exhibition of photographs at
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, as MICHAEL TUMELTY reports
WHILE you're at a Prom concert, being distracted by peripheral
activities such as foyer music from school bands, and endless
merchandising -- from CDs to cook books -- look out for Passing Shots.
That's the title of the exhibition of work by final year students of
photography at the Glasgow College of Building and Printing, which you
should find located in the foyer area of the circle in the Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall.
You can't miss the exhibition. As well as familiar photographic genres
-- still life, landscapes, portraiture and wildlife (yes, The Herald's
Jack McLean is one of the mugshots) -- the display features work that is
quite clearly commercial in its orientation, relating to fashion and
cosmetics.
Behind the exhibition lies a bit of enterprise. The 12 advanced
diploma students from the college have generated and organised the
entire show themselves. They formed a collective and each member was
given a task. Between them, they organised and secured the booking of
the venue, the sponsorship (from B &amp; S Visual Technologies, one of the
biggest photographic labs in the UK), catering for a sponsor's night,
the production of posters, publicity, exhibition boards -- the entire
caboodle.
Less self-consciously arty than some exhibitions, Passing Shots has a
clear message. ''Our intention here is to get work,'' said a spokesman
for the group. ''The exhibition is a shop window to show industry we're
employable. It is creative work but it's related to commercial
photography.''
And to underline their intention, with a wee professional flourish the
students have cannily appended their business cards to the display
boards.
''There's no self-indulgence here,'' said Brian Swinburne, course
leader at the college, who described his function in the group as ''the
referee in discussions''. The aim is clear, he said: to develop
initiative and independence.  See Passing Shots. See tomorrow's talent
today.
* Passing Shots runs at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall till July 31.

HAVING worked under the command of no fewer than six chief constables
within the last 32 years, I am perhaps in a better position than most to
address John Stephen's letter (June 6).
There has, of course, been a lowering of height standards and the
predominately male force of yesteryear is now receding at a rapid pace,
leading to a lack of much-needed strength on the beat.
I am all for equality but the more able female officers under my
section of command clearly recognise and share these concerns. We lose
the street services of female officers during pregnancy for a minimum of
14 months, and often considerably longer, and the problems are
self-evident.
Perhaps if your correspondent whose letter castigated that of Mr
Casely had policed in more modern times he would have been able to be
more objective and accurate in his observations.
Children's Panels fail miserably in dealing with juvenile crime with
the accent being to assist the offender clearly signalling to young
recidivists that there are no boundaries they cannot cross, which
hinders rather than assists the child.
Were the public to be made aware of the extent that criminals go free
from serious charges due to plea bargaining, and how little of a
sentence they actually serve before being released into their midst,
there would be a public outcry.
Sheehy, lauded by Mr Stephen as the way forward, was so seriously
flawed that following overwhelming opposition from outwith the police
service, notwithstanding the staff associations, it was largely kicked
into touch.
Despite this the police service is still suffering from spin-offs
which have seriously reduced earnings and conditions to such an extent
that recruitment problems are already being encountered in some areas,
albeit thankfully not yet in Strathclyde.
Leslie Sharp has succeeded in bringing Strathclyde Police up to its
authorised strength and may well gain an increase in establishment,
something his predeccesors failed to do in more affluent times.
The various operations such as Blade and Turnkey raised public
awareness of knife-carrying thugs and housebreakings, as indeed it was
intended to do, and without such public support we cannot succeed.
Operation Eagle, recently launched, should result in greater inroads
into the drugs menace in the coming months.
Against a background of considerable reductions in crimes, offences,
and road accidents, nearly 7000 police officers and many others outwith
the police service are correct in their assessment that Leslie Sharp is
worthy of, and indeed due, the highest possible accolade.

ANDREW ANDERSON hits the nail firmly on the head in his letter on
drugs (June 7).
The USA experiment in prohibition did nothing to reduce the
consumption of alcohol but led to the trade being driven underground
with resultant smuggling, backroom hooch, and unprecedented gangsterism.
No lessons were learned and today they are fighting a losing battle
against drugs, a situation which has developed in Britain.
The Scottish police have claimed, with some pride, an increasing
success in detecting drug supplies, but the Customs say that this is
only to be expected because of the huge increase in drugs importation.
If drugs were legalised it would cut the feet from the gangster
barons. It would give the authorities the power to license suppliers and
bring drug supply under the same control as the supply of alcohol. It
would also rob youngsters of the excitement of taking part in an illegal
activity.
This is no overnight cure, but it would be a giant step in the right
direction.
At the same time the agencies which try to combat alcohol/drugs abuse
should be given more support as they are seriously underfunded.
One Glasgow centre which had 16 detoxification beds could seldom use
any more than six because of lack of funds to employ more staff. This is
only one example among many.

The concept of a festival of pop classics causes me no grief
Michael Tumelty assesses the popular role of Royal SNO Prom concerts,
a series purists love to lambast
LOVE them or loathe them, they're here again. In one sense at least,
the Royal Scottish National Orchestra's annual season of Prom concerts
is the most innocuous event on Scotland's musical calendar. An annual
festival of popular, light classical music, the Proms mean no harm.
There is nothing in them to offend or abrade, nothing to provoke outrage
-- no Schnittke, no MacMillan.
Yet, pound for pound, their annual return seems to excite more comment
than the most ambitious events in the regular winter series of concerts
given by the orchestra. Critics save their best shots for the Proms,
questioning what they are, who they are for. They are insipid, they are
banal, they are cheap -- no big-name soloists or conductors. They are
free of challenge -- no meat in the programmes -- and they are
constructed strictly according to the philosophy of the lowest common
denominator.
As the Proms have moved through the country, with smaller series in
Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh, heading for the full whack in Glasgow --
a dozen concerts over a fortnight, beginning this Friday -- newspaper
reports have questioned their function and recorded thin attendances
(sometimes inaccurately, claimed the RSNO press officer yesterday).
On Sunday, at the inaugural concert at Adelaide's, the latest venue to
be unveiled in Glasgow, a consistent and faithful RSNO subscriber -- who
goes to absolutely everything -- said he had gone up to Dundee to sample
the Proms, and then proceeded to unleash a diatribe on the whole
business, pronouncing the programme and the conductor second rate, and
the entire concept crass. Not so much pop as pap, was the basic
criticism.
I tend to sit happily on the fence where the Proms are concerned. I
don't believe there's a correlation between them and the winter season
-- the thesis is that the punters who do not normally go to classical
concerts, but attend the Proms, will thus be attracted towards the
relatively heavy duty winter season concerts (which, in any case, are
not that heavy duty). I don't buy that, any more than the notion that
the large mass who love operatic highlights and bleeding chunks will go
along for a full night of opera.
The concept of a festival of pop classics causes me no grief, though
to an extent I can sympathise with the hard-core RSNO follower who would
like to hear his favourite orchestra in the summer but feels that it's
doing nothing for him.
The one criterion to which the Proms must adhere, however, is that
bums have to be on seats. That they are a commercial success seems to me
an imperative. Apart from any other considerations, the Proms are
dependent for their atmosphere -- festive, party, whatever -- on a good,
lively crowd. Without one, then questions should certainly be asked. As
of last week, reported the RSNO, the Glasgow series -- with one
exception -- was selling an average of about 1200 per concert, which is
a long way short of filling the Royal Concert Hall.
As to the programming this year: overall it's a series of labelled
packages, tied in to very familiar marketing strategies from the
populist, high-sales end of the classical market. Thus the presence of
evenings entitled Essential Opera, Essential Ballet, Classic Romance,
and so on.
There are a couple of unusual concerts which, if they come off, might
be intriguing. Strike up the Band appears to be essentially a tribute to
the big-band era. New Zealand conductor, Sir William Southgate, will
make his debut with the RSNO in a programme that will include his own
arrangements of classic melodies by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, and
Richard Rodgers. (And surely even the most dyed-in-the-wool, elitist,
classical hardcase recognises the quality of these composers -- if not,
sorry, you're a deadhead.)
And, if it comes off, the Evening at the Movies is another interesting
programme in that it will feature the music of Patrick Doyle (scores for
Indochine, Carlito's Way, Dead Again, and many others). Whether that one
works is down to the personality and communication skills of Doyle
himself, who will present the programme.
Prize for the most bizarre programme of the series, however -- and
it's so wacky it might just come off -- lands on conductor Wayne
Marshall. Before conducting the orchestra and chorus in Carl Orff's bit
of bawdy gigantism, Carmina Burana, Marshall will direct a short first
half (around 25 minutes) that will contain his own arrangements of Duke
Ellington jazz classics. Mood Indigo meets Carmina Burana? Hmmm.
These apart, there is the regular choice of the Mozart Evening, the
Viennese Evening, the Popular and Baroque Classics evenings. And so on.
Nothing there for you? Let the RSNO know your views, then, on a summer
alternative.
* Classic Romance with Carl Davis opens the Prom season, at the Royal
Concert Hall, on Friday at 7.30pm.

THE Hon John Sykes is not a household name except perhaps in
Scarborough, which he has represented in the Conservative interest since
1992. This was after four years tough training on Kirklees Borough
Council.
Yesterday, however, Mr Sykes had the chance to make up for lost time
and register his name among the annals of parliamentary rebellion. The
Sykes moment of destiny arrived in the unlikely setting of Standing
Committee ''A'' on European legislation which was discussing Spanish
integration into the Common Fisheries Policy.
This particular committee has a number of things going for it, not
least of which is that it allows all MPs to question the responsible
Minister, although only committee members are then allowed to vote. This
allows veterans of countless fisheries wars, such as yours truly and Jim
Wallce, to turn up and generate a few waves. It also allowed the
anti-Europeans to turn up and express their new-found interest in the
subject.
Yesterday, however, we were very much the supporting act because Sykes
had chosen this moment to launch his ambush on Government fisheries
policy by tabling an amendment.
The Sykes subject and timing were impeccable. The Government fisheries
policy has been a shambles for a long time and the accelerated Spanish
access to western waters is making a bad job even worse.
Over the past two years the Spanish have totally outmanoeuvred the
leaden-footed UK Fisheries Ministers to transform a position where they
were bound hand and foot by their own Treaty of Accession into one where
progressive increases in Spanish access seems inevitable with each
passing fisheries Council.
This Spanish demarche was carried through by the expedient of
doctoring the 1985 treaty and then persuading the rest of the European
Union to accept the Spanish language version of the treaty.
The key and successful Spanish tactic was to change a position in
which they required unanimous agreement for a treaty amendment to one
where only a majority vote is required to secure further gains.
How exactly this was allowed to slip past UK Ministers is a mystery,
but dark suspicions remain among the fishing community that Spanish
access was traded off against other more pressing priorities for the UK
Government.
Certainly there has never been any evidence of the UK showing the
determination of the Spanish who even threatened to bring the expansion
of Europe to a shuddering halt unless they got their own way on
fisheries.
Now we have been left with a fisheries policy which is untenable and
in which the coastal communities have lost confidence. Against an
already fraught position of a declining resource there is the threat of
the Spanish Armada pillaging the western waters.
Public anxiety has been heightened by the Canadian-Spanish clash in
the spring, and both the Scottish and English fleets still proudly fly
the maple leaf to signify support for a Government prepared to take
resolute action to save its fishery.
Indeed it was something of a surprise to Sykes to learn, in the course
of the debate, that the Scottish fleet flies two flags -- the maple leaf
and the saltire.
To add to the Fisheries Minister's misery he found there was a
consensus on the committee in favour of repatriation, or
regionalisation, of fisheries policy to allow control of the resource
and enforcement of regulations to be determined by national governments.
Elliot Morley, the mild-mannered Labour fisheries spokesperson, even
found himself uttering the dreaded ''R'' word -- renationalisation.
To all of this the Fisheries Minister had no answers. He hadn't seen
the Spanish proposals for controlling their boats. He didn't think it
was in order to speculate on whether fisheries policy was an appropriate
subject for the Intergovernmental Conference. He introduced the concept
of ''kilowatt-days'' as the new means of controlling fisheries effort in
front of a disbelieving committee.
The Sykes timing was impeccable. He found himself proposing an
amendment which was showing every sign of being carried against a
Minister who has run out of answers.
He began his closing speech well. It was time for blunt speaking and
decisive action, as they say in Yorkshire, and his constituency demanded
nothing less. For 1000 years his fishermen had put to sea and that
heritage was not to be jeopardised. He was a member of Parliament, not a
member of the Government.
And then disaster struck. The Sykes nerve was lost and the pass sold.
Sykes whimpered that he had decided to withdraw his amendment. Worse was
to follow. The committee promptly refused him leave to withdraw and the
chairman put the matter to the vote.
As the Sykes luck would have it, the initial ''S'' comes near the end
of the alphabet and thus it was, with the vote tied at five a piece, all
eyes turned back to Sykes.
The day of destiny ended with indignity. The hon member for
Scarborough sent his own amendment to the bottom -- the man who spoke
for Yorkshire but voted with the Government.

MRS Denise Brett, who was suspended by court order last year from
controlling a Scottish children's cancer charity, did not oppose her
expulsion from her post as managing director yesterday.
Lord Johnston made a permanent order at the Court of Session, removing
Mrs Brett, of Drum Brae Park, Edinburgh, from control of the Leukaemia
and Cancer Children's Fund and from taking any part in its management.
The judge also banned the committee of the charity from disposing of a
house named Torwood, Carrbridge, Inverness-shire, or from repaying
#37,000 to Mr Anthony Harris and his wife, Dorothy, Mrs Brett's sister.
Last August, Lord Allanbridge granted a temporary court order stopping
Mrs Brett from taking any part in the management of the charity, which
she founded in 1982 and which had been supported publicly by Princess
Alexandra, Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, and
Marti Caine and other celebrities.
The Court of Session was told then that the reason for suspension was
to prevent continuing mismanagement in the administration of the trust
and to protect the charity's property.
It was claimed that Mrs Brett paid herself #300 a week, contrary to
the charity's constitution. The court also heard allegations that Mrs
Brett organised the management of properties owned or leased by the
charity for the benefit of members of her family.
It was claimed that Mr and Mrs Harris occupied the bungalow, Torwood,
while families being helped by the charity lived in a caravan in the
garden of the house.
Mr Anthony Macinver, counsel for the Lord Advocate, told the court
yesterday that he believed Mr and Mrs Harris were still living at
Torwood as employees of the charity.
The court move followed an investigation by the Scottish Charities
Office, the team within the Crown Office which investigates charities.
After yesterday's hearing, Mr Brian Logan, director of the Scottish
Charities Office, said: ''Charities were made more accountable to the
public through Part 1 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
(Scotland) Act 1990, which enables the Lord Advocate to investigate
allegations of misconduct and mismanagement.
''The terms of the final orders will reassure the public that
charities are closely supervised and that the Crown Office will act
decisively in any cases of maladministration.''

THE entire K Division of Strathclyde police centred on Paisley has
received the high commendation award from Chief Constable Leslie Sharp,
accorded to a whole divisional team for the first time.
Mr Sharp praised the ''outstanding professionalism and enthusiasm'' of
the men and women -- police and civilians -- of the division.
He singled out the initiative and commitment shown by the team in
ensuring the success of three special 90-day operations, Dove, Hawk and,
most recently, Dragon, which targeted drugs-based violence, much of it
involving guns.
In the latest phase, K Division officers have made 300 arrests and
cautioned 3000 people. They have taken 28 guns off the streets and
seized more than #50,000 worth of illegal drugs in three months.
Despite the figures, divisional commander Chief Superintendent Mike
Currie yesterday told The Herald: ''We set out to achieve public support
and confidence and we were not going to do that if we went in with the
heavy hammer where it was not necessary.''

LOOKING weary, and sounding it, the President of the Board of Trade
yesterday picked his way carefully through a statement on the export of
British arms to Iran. It is usually easy to spot when Mr Heseltine
believes himself to be in a hole. When he is confident of the material
in front of him he goes into mace-swinging mode. Yesterday he did not
look as if he could have picked up a paper-clip. Careful modulation of
voice, and even more careful choice of phrase characterised his
treatment of what is either a massive error by Government departments or
yet another tributary for the river of sleaze. At the moment the balance
of evidence appears to support the suggestion that negligence and
incompetence on a grand scale have attended the affair. Sleaze-stirrers
need not give up hope entirely, but the complexity of the case and the
ardent denials of the litigious Mr Jonathan Aitken make it unlikely that
their case will prosper.
What is left is bad enough. Six weeks after Brian Wilson's questions
were sent, Mr Heseltine stood up to give his reply. To his credit he
appears to have spent the intervening period conducting a thorough
review of a murky affair. British companies, it seems, have made a habit
of applying for export licences for weapons without supplying the full
supporting documents. British intelligence warned that Singapore was
being used as an apparent destination for arms which were almost
certainly intended for Iran. At this time the British Government's
position, so eloquently expounded by Lord (then Geoffrey) Howe, was that
Britain would not supply lethal equipment to either side in the
Iran-Iraq war and should not approve orders for defence equipment that
would improve the capability of either side to inflict lethal damage.
All of this was known in Whitehall yet, if we are to believe the
evidence of Mr Heseltine's inquiry, nobody appeared to put the evidence
together.
It is tempting to disbelieve this assertion. Yet there is enough
evidence of crass incompetence in Government for the cock-up theory to
be true. Either way there is a need for more evidence. Customs and
Excise are investigating, and other Commons committees are eager to be
involved. Lord Scott's inquiry into the arms to Iraq scandal must not be
involved at this stage. How convenient it would be if another example of
Government incompetence were to be used to lengthen, and thereby delay,
what will certainly be a condemnation of other aspects of the same
problem.

THIS year 71 art students worked in 56 schools throughout Strathclyde.
The scheme began in 1990 and since has grown tenfold: schools want more
and students love it. ''We see a huge difference in those who have
taught,'' says Jane Allan, co-ordinator of Glasgow School of Art's
successful Artists in School Project.
The results are on show till June 25: a beguiling mix of bright, bold
creations ranging from a life-size tiger (by Claire Biggs and the
children of Arthurie Nursery) to sophisticated hats from Douglas Academy
and futuristic living modules by St Bride's High.
Biggs compiled a fascinating illustrated book on her 10 mornings with
pre-fives in Barrhead; how they tackled potato prints and tissue-paper
stained glass; how she spent the weekend painting pasta shapes. These
clear, concise explanations provide a means of enlightenment for
visitors that others could usefully follow.
The show includes clay tiles to celebrate Shawlands Primary's
centenary and T-shirts from St Patrick's inspired by aboriginal designs.
Ayr Academy made copper jewellery. Luci Ransome at St Bonaventure's
organised patterned cut-out garments for a washing line project for her
second years. Cardinal Newman High pupils drew to noises made by trains,
showers, chopping carrots and a hair dryer as part of a mark-making
exercise devised by Denham and Levy. Largs sixth years did life drawing
and footwear design workshops; Penilee Nursery painted hands and feet,
(theirs) and Bannerman High wove lively textiles.
This vast range of ages, skills, projects and ideas cannot fail to
impress. It's the fourth such show and looks set to be a welcome annual
event. The Artists in Schools Project is definitely an all-round winner.

SUBSIDISED social rented housing is one of Scotland's most important
socio-economic assets. Even in National Housing Week this statement
seems deeply unfashionable and maybe reads as a rather dated ideological
shibboleth. Nevertheless, it is supported by two timely articles (June
5).
Professor Duncan MacLellan pointed out that Scotland has avoided the
extremes of negative equity and repossession, while Chris Stone
(Business Herald) detailed the consensus among research and finance
institutions that low inflation, reduced tax incentives, and the demise
of permanent full-time careers will reduce house values over 20 years
and that ''housing as a speculative investment will not return''.
The adequate supply and maintenance of affordable social rented
housing is a significant factor in the different experiences of Scotland
and England.
Large numbers of members of our contemporary society will need, at
various times in their lives, access to affordable housing in various
locations, for varying periods and uses. Owner-occupation is too
inflexible and risk-inherent for such people to utilise in periods of
early household formation, or (lengthening) unemployment and increased
longevity associated with special needs.
The policy-makers should now revise their view of the respective
merits of social renting and owner-occupation and take cognisance of the
social and economic stabilising and enabling aspects of affordable
rented housing as opposed to the risk and jeopardy of owner-occupation.

I WONDER why Mr Donald McNeill, chief executive of the South Ayrshire
NHS Trust, thinks that health boards will be either willing or able to
find more money for nurses' pay (June 10).
In the ''bad'' old days before the NHS reforms, when hospital and
other services were administered by local units of health boards, it was
not unusual for a unit which had exceeded its budget allocation to look
for, and receive, a financial supplement from its parent health board.
The reforms, however, changed all this and Trusts are responsible for
their own affairs - they should have no expectations of a refreshing
suck of financial milk from the mother-figure of the main purchaser
(health board) whenever things do not go as they would have wished.
It is bad enough that politicians should seek to foist local pay
bargaining on professional staff who do not want it, but people such as
trust chief executives, who are close to the operational front line,
should be best placed to recognise that staff are not yet prepared to
accept the change and should plan their services accordingly.
They would so plan if they were not so busy jumping through the hoops
of dogma held by their political masters.
Mr McNeill had hoped to fund part of the pay increase by ''cost
improvements'' - in plain English, by savings. The NHS reforms have
spawned a plethora of managerial posts with pretentious titles and roles
of doubtful value.
Someone in Mr McNeill's position might well find it profitable to
consider ''down-sizing'' his management structure. Such a move might
well produce a general improvement, not simply a cost improvement.

OVER the past few months I have been dismayed to notice the increase
in job-share adverts for teachers in your paper plus the silence of your
education correspondent on this issue.
At a time when there is a surplus of qualified personnel for these
posts surely it is ludicrous to accept part-time commitment in the
education of children.
Were the school boards and PTAs consulted on this? If not, why not, as
they are the children's voices in the education system, especially the
primary sector?

I WAS delighted to hear that Robert Owen enjoyed his visit in a
laboratory and impressed by his enthusiasm to do research (June 13).
I am married to a scientist and have a lot of respect and admiration
for the profession. There is a need to point out, however, that the road
is often long and hard, funding scarce, and that scientists do not
always get the recognition they deserve.

YOUR leader is perceptive and constructive in suggesting that the real
problem of declining domestic consumption of whisky is inescapably one
of marketing (June 12).
Historically whisky has appealed to the more experienced drinker; what
has changed is the far greater consumption of spirits by the young and
female market.
It is perhaps worth reconsidering the Royal Commission into the
British taste for whisky which warned that the British public wanted a
whisky ''of less marked characteristics''.
Whisky marketing in the UK appears to be one of selling marked
characteristics to its mature target market. The industry seems to lack
the vision to promote whisky to the younger markets.
I accept the view that there was no problem until the English got
jealous and imposed tax and that a reduction would be good for farmers,
producers, consumers, and the balance of payments. I do not accept the
view that a 20% drop in sales can be solely attributed to a 2[1/2]%
price increase.
When one adds a mix to a bland spirit it is the bland spirit drink
that commands the premium price, not whisky. Has one ever seen this
promoted as low-cost, low-calorie, and environmentally more friendly?
The younger market likes ice and ''sippers.'' Is whisky ever so
promoted or do we just rubbish anyone who prefers ice?
Can a tourist get crushed ice? It is wonderful with whisky despite the
traditionalist view.
As long as the industry sees itself as responsible for just
advertising game birds, 4 x 4s, hunting, fishing, shooting, tweeds, cut
crystal, and heritage, etc, it should not be too surprised if the young
vote for a product that offers style and fashion they understand.
It took an Irishman to explain to me that one does not drink whisky,
one eats it. Think on the oyster, one holds it in the mouth until one
can no longer taste it and only then swallows.
Let the mature market eat their whisky while the industry further
promotes drinking it to the young.

THE ''Class of 1990'' is confused. It may flatter some of them and age
a few, but in general many at The Herald's forum of 80 artists and arts
administrators at the Tramway on Monday night were, to some extent, a
product of Glasgow's year as European City of Culture.
Five years on, that there should be among them such a range of concern
for the current direction of the city's arts policy, is worrying.
Many of them saw the programme for this year's Mayfest as a
disappointment because it did not seek to compete in the first division
of the European arts league -- a backward step for a forward-looking
city where there are still great opportunities.
Angus Farquhar, director of the NVA organisation, spoke
enthusiastically about the range of funding possibilities that made
Glasgow a unique place to work, and people working there the envy of
those in other cities. But when funding cash-flow, rather than its
availability, had necessitated moving his production Stormy Waters from
the end of May to the end of July, many people had suggested that the
show was ''better off out of Mayfest''.
He said: ''Mayfest has lost its buzz. There is a degree of
indifference to it because, from its birth to now, Glasgow is a
different city; and Glasgow is an emotional city, and it is not likely
to change its mind.''
Neil Murray of 7:84 Theatre Company questioned an assessment of
Mayfest that seemed to have turned a festival with problems of poor
information and communication into a victory.
''It is a mistake to make it parochial,'' he said. ''We want to be
seen alongside Robert Lepage, even if we suffer by comparison.''
The perceived parochialism in this year's programme was also
criticised by dancer Marissa Zenotti of Anatomy, who was angered by the
cover of the Mayfest brochure depicting ballroom specialists Donnie
Burns and Gaynor Fairweather. ''It was a smack in the face to people in
Scotland who are making dance,'' she said.
Mary Picken, arts officer of the STUC and a member of the Mayfest
board, said the reorganisation of this year's festival was a recognition
that that the city was not the same as it was when Mayfest started, and
confusion had arisen about what constituted a Mayfest event.
David McLennan of Wildcat Stage Productions, another board member,
said: ''The early Mayfests did not energise the city as people say they
did, and the demands on it have grown. It cannot possibly meet the
aspirations of the different artistic communities.''.
That realism was reflected in much of what was said. Too much was
expected of the city's annual festival and if Farquhar's suggestion that
it should be scrapped found little favour, there was general agreement
on the need for an overhaul.
On the other hand, the commitment of Glasgow's arts community was
reflected in the willingness to participate in such a forum. It will be
followed by a series of events in Tramway in the autumn. Watch this
space for details. In the meantime the debate continues here.

AT a time of year when a large number of fair-skinned Baywatch Scots
are intent on darkening their surface pigment, it is quite peculiar to
view an exhibition where genetic non-white womanhood highlights great
anxieties and demands your immediate attention.
Photogenetic is an intriguing collection of more than 20 international
artworks by ''women of colour''. The show was created by the relentless
Maud Sulter who through the combination of poetry and photography has
flown the flag of international displacement and inheritance for over a
decade.
The exhibition is about protest, power and a highly complicated
identity. In the context of South Africa we conjure up images of big,
strong, fleshy women who may be regarded as relatively passive and
accepting of the surrounding political climate -- not so on the July 12,
1990. The combined visual unity of Maingard, Thompson and Meintjes
highlights the power of female solidarity through media propaganda.
Photogenetics blatantly flaunts the intellectual scale. This is a
powerful united nation with its values firmly rooted in the victim and
the voyeur. In attempting to widen the black woman's creative umbrella,
one feels that, similar to international fishing rights, ''flags of
convenience'' have been brought into operation to make certain elements
belong which might otherwise be the subject to further consideration.

I THREW my hands up in horror when I read that Ettrick and Lauderdale
District Council's crime prevention committee had written to Lothian and
Borders Chief Constable Sir William Sutherland asking him for permission
for environmental officials to view tapes merely to spot litter dumpers
and businesses which may, or may not, be using official plastic sacks
(May 31).
The cost of an environmental official would be massive in comparison
to the amount recoverable if the official were to view and spot from
eight cameras recording 24 hours a day, seven days a week, any petty
offences that may or may not be being committed.
During the past two or three years since closed circuit television
surveillance systems were first introduced to Scottish towns and cities
crime in areas covered by the surveillance cameras has taken a very
noticeable dive.
Statistics show that crime in the first town to pioneer CCTV has
enjoyed and still enjoys a 75% decrease in crime in its town centre.
A joint effort by the police and local businesses everywhere is being
rewarded with great success in the fight against crime.
Ettrick and Lauderdale District Council does not seem to understand
that the object of CCTV surveillance systems is to promote and encourage
security and public safety for the benefit of the inhabitants, in
particular the promotion of safety from crime and fear of crime.
Funding for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of CCTV has
come, not from public money, but from local businesses and from
donations from the business sector in particular.
Some regional and district councils help to pay for the wages of
handicapped persons to monitor the systems on an annual basis, but this
council funding is not guaranteed.
It is tragic that shopkeepers who have helped to fund the CCTV for the
good of their own community run the risk of being so mistrusted that
they will be watched by that very system they have helped to finance, in
the unlikely event that they do not use official plastic sacks.
It is only recently that the powers that be forced councils to charge
for the collection of commercial refuse which used to be funded from our
rate bills.
I suggest that Ettrick and Lauderdale District Council withdraw their
request to view tapes which can contain evidence relating to crimes of a
much more serious nature.

WHEN is a lottery not a lottery? The answer is when it provides a lot
of money for its sponsors. Not by chance, but as a certitude.
The likelihood of our Government intervening in curbing the obscene
salaries and bonuses of the directors of Camelot must surely be chancy
since it will be yet another example of its complacency in its refusal
to accept that the rich are becoming even richer at the expense of the
poor.
The punters are not only being plundered but deceived. Not to have
envisaged the extent of jackpots and curtailed the top prize in order to
spread the bounty is inexcusable.
The gullibility of the participants, too, is incredible. If the kitty
is, say #10m, wouldn't it be sensible to have it shared rather than
giving one the lot? The consolation prize of #10 is scarcely worthy of
the name.
Moreover, who benefits from what must be an enormous amount of
interest on the vast sums accruing? Not the punters, I'll be bound.

Is Linford Christie ready to run away from the career which has
brought him fame and fortune? Doug Gillon reports
THAT Linford Christie should call the company which handles his
affairs Nuff Respect speaks as eloquently about him as many of the
profiles and career obituaries which will feature on the pages of
today's prints.
Respect is a ubiquitous word when you talk with Britain's most
successful athlete. He appears obsessed to the point of paranoia by the
notion that he has been accorded insufficient credit for his remarkable
portfolio of titles and achievements.
Christie cites media harassment for his decision to give up a career
which has made him a millionaire, and has brought him worldwide acclaim.
Many will doubt that he can bring himself to jump from the gravy train,
especially when it is in full flight towards next year's Olympics. But
yesterday he remained insistent that he would quit at the end of this
season, and would not defend his 100 metres crown in Atlanta.
''At the end of the season, that's it . . . I'm finished,'' said
Christie in a TV outburst late on Monday. ''I'll never wear a running
vest again . . . The British press are the scourge. There is so much
pressure from the media.''
Yesterday, before going to ground, he had a lengthy conversation with
his agent, Sue Barratt. She said he remains firm in his decision to
quit, and that it was ''purely down to Linford's hounding by the
media''.
By lunchtime yesterday, Ms Barratt had logged more than 150 calls,
wanting to know whether this decision was indeed final, and not just
another of his many eruptions -- he has quit before -- or even an
astutue commercial ploy. He is currently in negotiation with the British
Athletic Federation over this year's events.
Christie had been on edge for some days -- not because of four defeats
in the past fortnight, Ms Barratt insisted, but because of what he sees
as the media's hysterical reaction to them.
''You say he has lost four times, but he is actually running faster
now than at the same stage last season,'' insisted Ms Barratt. ''I am
saying nothing about financial matters -- it is not right to talk about
them. But Linford is not obsessed with money. He would not go on
competing and getting beaten, like Carl Lewis.''
Christie has raced eight times this year, five times over 100 metres,
including a heat. He has lost once, but has suffered three defeats out
of three over 200 metres. These defeats, in London, Paris, and Rome,
have all been in the past fortnight, provoking speculation that, at 35,
Christie has passed the watershed.
Barratt cited a Sunday paper cartoon of him about to plunge off a
cliff as ''offensive''. Not ''grossly distasteful'' like his worst
nightmare, the celebrated ''lunchbox'' affair, when a tabloid newspaper
speculated about the contents of his lycra leotard. But Christie is
certainly obsessed by the media's constant preoccupation with his age.
''You know how much it rattles him,'' added Barratt.
I have seen him pin a journalist against a wall and give lectures on
the subject. In Helsinki, at last year's European Championships, he was
in a fury: ''Why say I am a good athlete for my age. Why not just say I
am a good athlete?''
He cannot understand what scribes perceive as a legitimate interest.
After all, Scotland's Allan Wells was the previous oldest Olympic 100m
champion at 28. How did Christie manage it at 32? And how does he get
stronger and faster at 35, older than any world-class sprinter in
history? These are inevitable questions.
But when reporters, following Christie's 100m defeat in Rome last
week, contacted Barratt, she read the danger signs: ''I warned them to
lay off his age.
''He is hounded constantly. When he pulled out of the World Indoor
Championships in Barcelona, I had a TV reporter on suggesting it was
drug-related. That was outrageous. Linford has been random tested four
or five times already this year -- three of them out of competition.''
Christie still resents his qualified exoneration from a doping
investigation at the Seoul Olympics, when, having drunk ginseng tea, it
was stated by the International Olympic Committee medical commission
that he had ''been given the benefit of the doubt''.
Christie, born in St Andrews, Jamaica, well recalls the days when
''old ladies would hold up their handbags because they saw a black
person''. But he has legitimate cause to feel persecuted.
On his England debut he was arrested along with two other athletes on
their way home. A policeman said: ''What's a nigger like you doing in an
England tracksuit.'' There was a row outside Shepherd's Bush police
station. Christie was bound over to keep the peace.
In 1988 he was wrongfully detained over alleged car theft, which must
have re-ignited his feelings about discrimination -- a black face behind
the wheel of an expensive car? How suspicious! The car had been supplied
by the British Olympic Association. Christie won #30,000 and a police
apology.
And in 1991, on the day following his World Championship 100m victory,
the Sun front page splash was about his younger brother being wanted for
allegedly breaking into a car.
More recently, he sued a black publication which carried a lurid
cartoon focusing on his physical assets. They have gone broke.
He is perceived as arrogant, though the quality is almost a sine qua
non among international sportsmen, and most certainly among sprinters.
''Whoever said losing wasn't important was a loser himself,'' Christie
was once quoted as saying. ''The only people who are remembered are the
winners.''
He also demonstrated the quality most notably when, warned for a false
start, he turned off the red light on the starting block, and
proclaimed: ''I never false start.''
But even some of his black team mates resent his arrogance -- notably
Derek Redmond, who said Linford was ''perfectly balanced -- he has a
chip on both shoulders'', after Christie had criticised the World
Championship gold medal relay team of which Redmond was a member.
Christie's preoccupation with respect would not permit him to brush
aside the ''lunchbox affair'' showing the macho, joking disregard which,
say, a rugby player might have done.
''Yes, he could have made a joke of it, exploited it even, and brought
out his own line of lunchboxes,'' said Barratt. ''But we would not do a
disgusting thing like that.''
What Christie has most spectacularly failed to grasp is that media
attention goes with the territory of being a sporting megastar. He has
found it hard to cope with tabloid intrusions focusing on former
relationships which produced three illegitimate children, including
nine-year-old twins, who were only acknowledged after definitive proof
by genetic testing.
Yes, the media have had a prickly relationship with him, but if their
aim has been to erode Christie's public respect, they have been
remarkably incompetent. He is universally popular.
The truth is, of course, and Ms Barratt conceded as much, that
Christie has had some sensational press, befitting his sensational
achievements. Even the more grotesque press excesses have contributed to
his riches. He is believed to be worth well in excess of #2m, has a
#500,000 sportswear contract and numerous other endorsements.
Can we really believe that the man who became a legend in his own
lunchbox will pass up such a lucrative meal ticket as Olympic year
approaches? I believe neither his ego, nor market forces, will permit
it. And if the British team really does line up in Atlanta without him,
that will be a sad day for British sport.

Nicholas Budgen MP, a prominent Tory Euro sceptic, reports how events
are beginning to turn against the Euro enthusiasts
IF you believe in the United Kingdom as a nation state with a unique
and effective constitution, then you should be happy with the events of
the past week. Thank the Euro sceptics who have spent much of their time
in recent years driving back encroachments upon the British Parliament
by the European Union.
We believe that our battle for parliamentary sovereignty is vital for
self-government in Britain. It is also important for Scotland. If the
United Kingdom is an effective entity then its effectiveness has great
importance for Scotland. The Scottish Nationalists have seen the English
attach less and less importance to our parliamentary institutions. If
we, the English, do not care for our constitution, why should the Scots
care for Westminster.
A resuscitated Westminster will be both a barrier and a challenge to
separatism. So long as Westminster is revered and supported it will be
more difficult for the Scottish Nationalists to appeal directly to the
European institutions. If the European institutions do not grow in
weight and authority, in law, or in the eyes of the world, then the
claim of the Scottish Nationalists that they can conduct Scottish
foreign policy through the EU is much diminished.
There have been three important indications in the past week that the
Conservative Party is returning to its ancient roots in the
constitution. On Thursday the Prime Minister gave a significant answer
at his questions in the House of Commons. The first question came from
Barry Legg. He is a concerned Eurosceptic. He asked yet another question
about the single currency.
The Prime Minister read out what was clearly a well-considered reply.
It was important in two respects. First, he said the circumstances for a
single currency may never be right. Secondly, if the time for a single
currency does arise, we should need to consider not only the economic
circumstances but the political and constitutional implications.
Both these points are a real disappointment to the Euro enthusiasts.
The enthusiasts would even advocate providing leadership in Europe
towards a single currency.
The implications of the Prime Minister's words was that he thought
there was a real chance that France and Germany would be unable to agree
upon a single currency. Even if France and Germany do agree, there is a
serious question as to how many other countries would both we able and
willing to join a single currency.
The second of the PM's points is a serious setback to Ken Clarke --
one of the most open enthusiasts for the single currency. He had hoped
that we could have a single currency without the matter being considered
in a referendum. If it is stated by the Prime Minister that the single
currency has political and constitutional implications, then we are
obliged to have a referendum before proceeding to a single currency.
Earlier this week Lady Thatcher made a characteristic intervention in
our national discussions. Her remarks about a single currency, were
simple, principled and even nationalistic. She made it plain that she
believed that Mr Major is becoming more and more sceptical and so are
the British people. Most of all, she said that she was in principle
opposed to a single currency.
Lady Thatcher's views are of the greatest importance in the Tory
party. Tory activists to a great extent take their lead from Mrs T.
There was a great deal of discussion and criticism at the last Tory
party conference over the Government's European policy. It is likely
that even today people reading and seeing Mrs T's contribution will be
putting down their motions about Europe for discussion at the Tory party
conference in the autumn.
Yesterday we had a vital meeting with the Prime Minister. The group
which met him was Fresh Start, founded in opposition to the Maastricht
Treaty. At its high point the group numbered about 100. The Whips got to
work and we lost many members. Thus its size and strength has varied
over the past two years. But all who go to the meeting of the Fresh
Start group are showing themselves to be opposed to European federalism.
It was interesting to note that about 50 Tory MPs attended yesterday's
meeting.
A modern Government is vast, and swollen yet further by treating the
parliamentary private secretaries as though they were members of the
Government. Thus in the present House of Commons only about 200 Tory MPs
are free of direct Government control. A quarter of the free men of the
Tory party attended. This was, in a still deferential party, a huge
display of brute force.
The PM gave us a long and very careful address. He started with an
analysis of events and personalities in Europe. He argued that there are
ambiguities and uncertainties to be found in both Germany and France in
their attitude towards a single currency. He argued that a single
currency may never be attempted even in France, Germany and the Benelux
countries. He also argued that if we were opposed now in principle to a
single currency there might be an attempt by other countries in Europe
to retaliate against us on other issues and that such retaliation would
be very much to our disadvantage.
The PM would not agree to a statement that he was now opposed in
principle to a single currency. The mood of the meeting was at first
respectful and friendly. Later the questioning was as critical as I have
heard in 20 years in the House of Commons.
We wanted a commitment in principle against the single currency. We
did not get such a commitment yesterday but no-one in their right mind
would have expected that the Prime Minister would have made a clear and
immediate commitment to us yesterday. The Prime Minister will reflect
upon the size and strength of opinion in the Tory parliamentary party.
The concessions to us will come, but they will come later.
This week we've seen a huge display of public opinion on British
nationalism. The Prime Minister's great objective is to hold our party
together. He will note that the balance of opinion has moved inexorably
against European federalism. We hope to restore the powers of
Westminster. In doing so we shall also help to preserve the union of the
United Kingdom.

Alan MacDiarmid reports on a pioneering Fife hospital project to
combat drug abuse among the mentally ill
THE RURAL setting of Cupar in Fife is an unlikely one for a pioneering
approach to drug abuse among the mentally ill which could lead the way
for psychiatric hospitals throughout the country.
Fife, however, has its pockets of deprivation and the accompanying
menace of drugs, just like the bigger towns and cities in Scotland. When
the drugs conspire with latent psychosis to make their users a menace to
themselves and others, Stratheden Hospital picks up the pieces.
Stratheden's approach was one of the success stories which emerged
from a survey carried out by the Royal College of Nursing for BBC's
Public Eye programme last night on the menace of drug abuse in
psychiatric hospitals -- much of which centred on the lurid image of
drug pushers freely offering their wares on hospital wards.
The reality is as likely to be misguided friends or relatives
''running an errand'' as professional dealers touring the wards peddling
their wares. In any event, compulsory searching and the other trappings
of the prison visiting room are not an option for a hospital. But
Stratheden's care management project goes beyond the mechanics of
prevention.
After four years of painstaking work they are at last starting to see
the results -- patients who are no longer a market for pushers because
they no longer take drugs.
Social worker Sheena Robertson, team leader for the project, and two
fellow social workers, engage with the patients, assess their needs and
offer a service linking with other agencies involved in their care --
nurses, psychiatrists, the DSS and the housing department -- to make
sure they can be effectively rehabilitated and returned to the community
without falling back into their old ways.
''What used to happen is that people with a mental health problem and
a drug problem often did not get the mental health care they needed
because of their drug problem,'' said Robertson.
''These people were recognised as difficult to offer treatment to.
Drug misuse leads to chaotic lifestyles -- not turning up for
appointments, not following up aftercare.
''Our approach to them is that, yes, we would like to minimise the
drug problem, but we are not going to let that stop you from getting
mental health care.
''There was a fear that we would be increasing illicit drug use in the
hospital. No doubt there are still drugs getting in, but that has not
been increasing. We are conscious of why they are using them and how
they are using them.
''But we do not encourage drug use in the hospital. We would not turn
a blind eye to it. If I were aware of pushers I would report them to the
police. I don't think there is a major problem here.
''Our approach is centred on helping people to recognise why they are
taking drugs, and on harm minimisation. They need a co-ordinated care
plan that is tailored to the individual, and gets them involved in their
own care.
''It takes a long time -- you have to hang on in there.''
Dr George Winslow, consultant psychiatrist, described the project's
target as a small but problematic group in Fife, mainly young men, who
had a predisposition to psychotic illness which was being precipitated
by the use of drugs -- at that time mainly LSD and amphetamines.
Fife has not shared the problems some other areas have with
schizophrenics caught in the ''revolving door syndrome''. But with this
drug-related group there was a pattern of repeated admissions throughout
the year, often for short periods because they were disruptive.
''They would be discharged, you would set up an elaborate care
programme, and they would not co-operate, rolling round the system like
loose cannons, banging into the social work department, GPs, the
police,'' he said.
Most of the group, other than those back in the community, are
detained under the Mental Health Act, and find their way into some
strand of the hospital's resettlement and rehabilitation programme.
''They get the benefit of something they never had before -- sustained
exposure to treatment, including drugs (the therapeutic variety). The
results really are breathtaking -- their attitudes change, they come
back to the real world.
''The important thing about the care management project is that the
workers are realistic about these people. They don't avoid the drugs
issue.
''I would be wrong if I said they never use drugs, particularly after
they are back in the community, but it tends not to be the ones that
were implicated at the start. They may smoke cannabis here and there.
But some do start again, and then you are back to square one.''
Dr Winslow says drug abuse is not a problem in the acute and
rehabilitation wards. ''I would be struggling to remember when we last
found illicit drugs among this particular group. When we do, we notify
the police, but it happens very infrequently.
''We have had pushers and we are alert to them, but it is not a big
problem. We have the co-operation of these patients. They are starting
to see the rewards of being well and to see the rewards of being off
drugs.''

THE Prestwick-built Jetstream 41 aircraft is to fly in military
colours for the first time later this year.
The Royal Thai Army has ordered two of the 29-seat turboprop planes
for transport use, with the first delivered in November and the second a
year later.
General Vilas Pongsuwan of the Royal Thai Army said: ''Clearly, the
Jetstream 41 provides the best solution for our transportation needs and
I am sure it will prove to be a popular aircraft.''
Orders and commitments for the Jetstream 41, which is about to be
fitted with an innovative noise control system, now total 144 worldwide.
Mr Mike O'Callaghan, managing director elect at Prestwick, said: ''We
are delighted. This is the first non-airline application of the aircraft
and it is gratifying that new roles are being evaluated.''
Meanwhile, Manx Airlines Europe has confirmed its order for an
additional three aircraft for use on its growing services within the
British Airways Express franchise.
One aircraft will be delivered in the coming weeks, with the other two
provisionally planned for 1996 delivery.

<TEXT>
THE jury trying two police officers accused of the manslaughter of
illegal immigrant Joy Gardner was sent home for the night after failing
to reach verdicts following five hours of deliberations.
The seven men and five women were warned by Mr Justice Mantell before
they left the Old Bailey not to discuss the case until they returned.
Mrs Gardner, 40, a mother of two, died after a violent struggle with
police who had gone to her home in Hornsey, north London, in July 1993
to deport her to Jamaica. She was restrained with a body belt and gagged
with 13 feet of tape wrapped round her head.
The prosecution has alleged this gag led to her death. She lapsed into
unconsciousness soon after it was applied and died four days later in
hospital from severe brain damage caused by oxygen starvation.
Detective Sergeant Linda Evans, 43, and Constable Colin Whitby, 48,
deny manslaughter.
Ms Evans told the jury she had never encountered such violence in her
life. Mrs Gardner was screaming, shouting, and threatening to kill
herself.
Ms Evans said she was dragged across a table by Mrs Gardner. She
agreed she had responded to Mr Whitby's requests and passed him two
rolls of tape.
Mr Whitby said he was solely responsible for applying the tape. He had
done so as a last resort because Mrs Gardner had bitten one officer and
he feared she would attack another or harm herself.

third time in two weeks.
The latest victim, a 45-year-old woman, was just 15ft from the beach
in Clearwater Bay in the New Territories when the shark attacked.
Lifeguards pulled the woman from shallow water where she had been
swimming with about 50 other people. Witnesses said a leg and an arm had
been ripped off and she died before reaching hospital.
Experts believe it may be a rogue tiger shark.
In previous attacks, a 21-year-old man was killed on June 2 after his
right leg was severed and a 44-year-old man was killed on June 1.
Shark experts think the same shark is responsible for these and other
fatal attacks in the same area in recent years.
Australian marine biologist Vic Hislop, who went to Hong Kong two
years ago after a number of fatal attacks, said the shark was a repeat
killer like the monster in the Jaws movies, and warned it could strike
again.
Some eyewitnesses reported seeing several fins and there were at least
nine bite marks in the victim's abdomen and back -- but ''only a big
shark could have easily severed the flesh and bones,'' a hospital
spokesman said.
Another middle-aged woman who was at Clearwater Bay said she heard the
victim shouting for help with her hands raised above her head.
The woman, who was identified only by her surname, Wong, then
disappeared. ''A pool of blood spilled out in the water, which was only
up to her chest,'' the witness said.
Hong Kong authorities ordered special warning flags to be raised at
beaches and regional councils called for more shark nets to be put up.
When two men died at the start of the month in the popular swimming
area it sparked fears that a shark that killed two swimmers in the area
in 1993 might have returned.
In June that year a hair salon owner was killed and two weeks later
another swimmer was killed by the same shark.
News of the latest attack brought sightseers armed with binoculars and
telecopes pouring on to the coastline hoping to catch a glimpse of the
killer.
Officals ruled out a shark hunt, saying it could increase the
danger.--Reuter.

Hong Kong, Tuesday
HIJACKERS robbed a Hong Kong-bound jetfoil of a consignment worth
HK$12m (#1m) today after diverting the craft and its 129 passengers into
Chinese waters, a spokeswoman for the jetfoil company said.
The hijackers, who boarded the jetfoil Guia in Portuguese-run Macau,
forced the captain to sail northwest into the Pearl River Delta towards
the tiny Chinese island of Qi Ao, said Betty Lim, spokeswoman for the
jetfoil company, Shun Tak Holdings.
The gang transferred money boxes belonging to a Chinese bank onto a
waiting speedboat and disappeared, she said.
The boxes were being transferred to Hong Kong by a private security
company, according to Lim, who could only say that the consignment was
valued at HK$12m.
Earlier reports the gang had stripped the passengers of their
possessions had proved unfounded and Lim said she understood none had
been robbed and no-one was hurt.
Hong Kong police said three men apparently armed with pistols forced
their way into the vessel's cockpit. Some shots were allegedly fired
during a struggle and some equipment was damaged, a police statement
said.
After reaching Qi Ao island, a fourth man in camouflage dress boarded
the jetfoil from a small boat. The gang took the money boxes and some
luggage and then fled aboard the small boat, which was driven by a fifth
accomplice.

Madrid, Tuesday
KING Juan Carlos of Spain today was at the centre of a secret service
telephone bugging scandal.
A leaked document from Cesid, the equivalent of both MI5 and MI6,
published in a Madrid newspaper listed almost 100 conversations
officials had listened to without the permission of a judge.
The response of the royal household was typical of the angry reaction
in Spain to the revelations that conversations had been monitored. Head
of the palace household Fernando Almansa said he was ''astonished'' by
the activities of the secret service.
Contents of the calls were not revealed but some involved businessmen
and politicians chatting to lovers.
The king's conversation was with a prominent Majorcan businessman. It
was not made clear who initiated the call.
Another was by Richard Cross, English skipper of the Spanish royal
yacht Fortuna. Even a chat between Ramon Mendoza, president of Real
Madrid, and Spanish actress Nati Abascal was listed.
Many other leading businessmen and diplomats like the former US
ambassador to Spain went into the secret files as did international arms
dealer Asnan Kashoggi in five years of bugging from 1985.
The conservative Popular Party today demanded that Socialist Premier
Felipe Gonzalez appear before parliament to explain the bugging scandal
and the chief state prosecutor ordered an immediate inquiry after
calling the telephone tapping ''a grave matter''.

Detroit, Tuesday
JAMES Nichols, whose brother Terry faces charges in the April 19
bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, said seven years ago the
structure could be levelled by a ''mega-bomb'', according to FBI
documents.
An informant told the FBI that James Nichols also drew a diagram of
the Alfred P Murrah Building, which was destroyed by the explosion that
killed 167 people, and produced a newspaper clipping that described the
facility, two newspapers in Detroit reported today, quoting the
documents.
About 100 pages of the FBI documents from the Nichols investigation
were unsealed in response to a lawsuit filed by the Detroit News and the
Detroit Free Press.
James Nichols, 41, has not been charged in connection with the
Oklahoma City bombing. He was freed from jail last month after being
held for a month on unrelated bomb-making charges and remains under FBI
surveillance.
He is charged with making and detonating illegal explosive devices on
his Decker, Michigan, farm, where his brother Terry and Timothy McVeigh
often visited. They are the only two people charged in connection with
the Oklahoma City bombing.
Nichols' comments about the Murrah Building were made in December
1988, shortly after the bombing of PanAm Flight 103 over Lockerbie, the
newspapers said. They quoted the documents as saying a confidential
informant told FBI investigators he had visited Nichols at that time and
Nichols expressed anger about the incident and blamed it on the US
government.
Nichols said a small bomb could bring down a jetliner and ''then
explained . . . that a mega-bomb capable of levelling a building could
be built,'' the informant said in the documents. Nichols offered the
Murrah building as an example of such a structure, the informant said.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
TENS of thousands of Bosnian army troops are massing north of
Sarajevo, part of an even larger force apparently preparing to try to
break the 38-month Serb siege of the city, UN officials said today.
''We can confirm government troop strength in the range of 20,000 to
30,000 men in the Visoko-Breza region,'' said a UN official who asked
not to be named.
''There's never been a massing of troops like this in the Bosnian war.
They clearly intend to strike towards Sarajevo. It seems the Bosnian
Serbs are mobilising to check any possible offensive. Things could get
very difficult very quickly,'' the official said.
Separatist Serb troops have surrounded the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo
since April 1992, hounding residents with shell and sniper fire and
blocking humanitarian aid deliveries.
Government forces are within 12[1/2] miles of the city in the
Visoko-Breza area to the northwest. Bosnian army soldiers could advance
along a major highway into Sarajevo if they were able to break through
Serb lines.
The Bosnian army outnumbers separatist forces but is at a severe
disadvantage against superior Serb armour and artillery.
Despite the disparity, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has pledged
to lift the siege of Sarajevo by November 25 this year at the latest.
UN sources say heavy combat could erupt around the city in days, not
weeks or months.
''All the indicators are there in the Visoko-Breza area -- heavy troop
movements,'' said Bosnian army sources speaking on condition of
anonymity. Troops from Bosnian army units had ''asked us to abandon two
observation posts in the area over the weekend and when we refused
somebody shelled us and we had to pull back''.
Bosnia's army has grown from a citizens' militia wearing sneakers and
mismatched uniforms and toting captured weapons to a respectable
infantry force capable and rockets.
Military analysts say an extended battle in Sarajevo they would be
assaulting the strongest Serb positions in Bosnia, fighting against at
least 12,000 soldiers backed by 500--800 heavy weapons including tanks,
artillery, mortars and rockets.
Observers say a concerted government effort to break the siege of
Sarajevo could entail thousands of casualties.
* A UN Security Council resolution to authorise deployment of a rapid
reaction force in Bosnia ran into difficulties today because of US
congressional reluctance to finance it, diplomats said.
The cost of the British-French-Dutch force is estimated at about $270m
over six months for troops plus additional funds for equipment. Since it
will be a part of the UN Protection Force (Unprofor), all UN members
must bear the cost. Washington has to pay about 30%, and the Clinton
administration must notify key congressional committees.
Diplomats said the task was made more difficult by comments from
Geneneral John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who told the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 7 that the new
force ''will be financed by national means and not by United Nations
means''.
US Ambassador Madeleine Albright told a private session of the
Security Council only that she still needed to consult on the
resolution. But diplomats said financing rather than the resolution's
text was the problem.
Russian Ambassador Sergei Lavrov said his country also was interested
in seeing financing information for the force and was awaiting figures.
He said he did not expect a vote until Thursday at the earliest.
Diplomats said China was opposed to the force and might abstain on the
resolution.
If there is no vote by the end of the week, British and French
officials fear momentum will be lost for the new force, which is to
protect vulnerable UN troops as well as act as a deterrent to Serb
fighters.--Reuter.

Paris, Tuesday
FRANCE will resume nuclear weapons testing in September and hold eight
tests at its South Pacific site, ending them next May in time to sign a
comprehensive test ban treaty, President Jacques Chirac announced today.
Chirac told a news conference his decision was vital to ensure the
reliability and security of France's nuclear stockpile and perfect
laboratory simulation techniques to make further tests irrevocable.
''I took this decision because I considered it necessary in the higher
interest of our country. This decision is, of course, irrevocable,'' he
said.
The new conservative Gaullist president said he had informed France's
main allies, as well as opposition leaders and the governments of
Australia and New Zealand of his decision.
He also said his government would study closing its only land-based
nuclear missile site on the Albion Plateau in southern France, a move
that would make submarine-launched missiles the main vector for the
French nuclear deterrent.
The United States said it was disappointed by France's decision to
resume nuclear testing but still hoped Paris would work towards a
comprehensive test ban by 1996, a senior US official said today.
''We're disappointed by the French government announcement today. The
United States has suspended its own nuclear testing and we hoped that
all other nuclear powers would do so as well,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
''We are encouraged, however, by France's decision at the NPT (nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty) review conference in April to commitment to
negotiating a CTB (comprehensive test ban) by 1996 and look forward to
working with them toward that goal,'' the official added.
He acknowledged however that achieving a comprehensive test ban -- as
the five nuclear powers promised the non-nuclear nations -- may be more
difficult because of France's decision to resume testing.
President Chirac meets President Clinton tomorrow at the White House.
US officials said the nuclear testing decision will be discussed but
will not dominate a heavy agenda that also includes Nato, European
security, Bosnia, and the Group of Seven summit this week in Halifax,
Nova Scotia.--Reuter.

THE Government was yesterday criticised by a former Tory Cabinet
Minister as it tried to beat off allegations that its policies had led
to a slump in the housing market.
As the Government placed its faith in mortgage insurance schemes,
former party chairman Sir Norman Fowler strongly supported Baroness
Thatcher's criticism of its housing record.
Lady Thatcher has said cuts in Miras -- mortgage interest relief at
source -- were one of the main reasons why voters were deserting Tories.
Sir Norman (Sutton Coldfield), Health and Social Security Secretary
from 1981 to 1987, said: ''I am not an uncritical adherent to all of
Lady Thatcher's historical account, interesting as it is. But I have to
say, on housing I believe she has got it absolutely right.
''It is in my view a great pity that the, then, Chancellor, Norman
Lamont, started the process of reducing mortgage tax relief in the 1991
and 1993 Budgets and that that process was continued in November 1993.''
He said it was no secret that the Treasury had wanted to reduce, and
preferably end, the relief: ''But the truth is that as far as housing is
concerned, the existence of mortage tax relief has led to much of the
increase in the home ownership we have seen.''
He added that economic conditions made it an excellent time to buy.
''What is needed is some confidence and some encouragement and that is
something the Government can give.''
He called for a mortgage tax relief scheme aimed specifically at
first-time buyers.
''I do hope that Ministers will take from this debate a message that
action is needed in this area and action is needed urgently,'' he said.
However, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley made it clear
householders had to come up with their own protection.
In a move which will delight the Tory right, but may well dismay the
average home-owner, Mr Lilley played up the option of encouraging the
spread of private insurance. The Government was determined to encourage
''cheaper, better, more comprehensive insurance,'' he said.
Earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions, the Prime Minister played
down the slump in the property market and spoke of the prospects for
home-ownership in the future.
Downing Street insisted that any U-turn decision on mortgage tax
relief was a matter for the Chancellor, while Mr Major told the Commons
of a ''dramatic'' increase in home-ownership in recent years.
He said: ''As the House should know, though perhaps not everybody will
wish to acknowledge, mortgage payments are around #130 a month lower
than in October 1990.
''And, perhaps more pertinently, as a proportion of average income,
they are now at their lowest for a decade. I think that shows very
clearly the prospects for increasing home-ownership in the future.''
In the Labour-initiated debate which followed, Mr Lilley's Labour
Shadow, Mr Donald Dewar, attacked the depressed state of the housing
market, the reduction in the building of housing for rent, and the
consequent impact on the construction industry.
Mr Dewar, who opened the debate, urged the Government to think again
about plans to limit the help available from income support to cover
mortgage payments for the unemployed.
In a comment guranteed to anger the right-wing Mr Lilley, he told the
Minister: ''I think you should listen to Lady Thatcher on this, someone
who recognises a betrayal when she sees one. She is someone I would have
thought your instincts would respect.''
Mr Lilley, however, said it was clear Labour had no policy to help the
70% of home owners who were not protected against job losses. They
hankered, he said, after much higher public spending but dare not commit
themselves. To hide their confusion they resorted to scaremongering and
talking down the housing market.
He told the House: ''The outlook for housing is a lot brighter than Mr
Dewar suggests, and the reforms of Income Support Mortgage Interest will
help make prospects brighter still.''
For Liberal Democrats, Diana Maddock (Christchurch) declared: ''If the
Englishman's home is his castle, it is this Government which has let
down the drawbridge, drained the moat and sent the guards home, leaving
the occupants vulnerable to attack from the dark knights of sickness,
unemployment and recession.''
Liberal Democrats believed Miras and income support for mortgage
holders should be replaced by a more coherent, effective and
means-tested benefit that would help homeowners on low incomes, said Mrs
Maddock.
But the Government could not have picked a worse time to reduce
mortgage tax relief, she insisted.
Tory Charles Hendry (High Peak) refered to Lady Thatcher's remarks on
mortgage tax relief and said that, although the qualifying amount was
increased under the her administration from #25,000 to #30,000, it had
not kept pace with inflation.
It would have needed to cover the first #60,000 of any mortgage by the
time Lady Thatcher left office to have kept up with price increases.
The biggest change to Miras came in 1988 when double relief was phased
out.
''Perhaps she might care to remember who was in charge of the
administration at that time,'' he said.

A GLASGOW property developer has appealed to Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang after a plan to turn a city centre, five-storey building into a
private mansion was turned down by Glasgow District Council.
Mr Alasdair MacDougall said yesterday he had taken the step on a
matter of principle. He maintained there was no logical reason why he
should not be able to transform the derelict building, adjacent to
George Square, into a grand private home, complete with shooting
gallery.
The council has rejected his application on the grounds that, ''the
size and physical configuration of the dwelling house is unsuitable for
a single family dwelling''.
Mr MacDougall, a chartered surveyor with MacDougall Partners, said the
company he jointly owns, Lee-Mac Properties Ltd, bought the building,
known as Gladstone House in March.
He then applied to the council for planning permission with a list of
potential uses for the nineteenth century building, which is not listed
but lies within the city's outstanding conservation area.
These included the private mansion idea; a proposal to turn the
building into office space; an application for a bar and restaurant; a
scheme to turn the building into 60 student bedsits; and a plan to
demolish it and replace it with a car park.
Both the student bedsit and the private mansion schemes were rejected,
leaving Mr MacDougall with the option of leasing the building as a
commercial concern. However, he is determined to fight for permission to
transform the former print office into a private home.
As he wandered through the building yesterday, painting a picture of
how the building could look, he said he had decided to appeal to the
Scottish Secretary because he believed it was his prerogative to convert
the building into a home if he wanted.
''If I couldn't lease the building, I would sell my flat in Glasgow
and live in it myself. The building could house a library, a shooting
gallery, and a conservatory. If I want to turn it into a five-storey
house, why not? I could also probably sell it for #500,000,'' he said.
Last night, John Watson, the council's senior depute of planning, said
he had not seen the application but added that any individual who had
been refused planning permission had the right to appeal to the
Secretary of State. The Scottish Office could then hold an inquiry.
Leaders of the new City of Glasgow Council have taken formal steps to
eradicate the bitter factional conflict that has dominated events at the
City Chambers for many years, writes JOHN MacCALMAN, Municipal
Correspondent.
In a motion to be placed before the Labour Group for approval, the
Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, argues that the authority of the
Labour Group and the party organisation would be compromised if ad-hoc
groups met in advance of group or party meetings with the express
intention of influencing group or party decisions.
This is a direct reference to the unsavoury battles between supporters
of Councillor Patrick Lally and his long-standing rival, Councillor Jean
McFadden.
Councillor Gould confirmed yesterday that any breach of the new ruling
would be dealt with under disciplinary procedures.
Meanwhile, the new council's executive committee has drawn up its
committee structure and the people to serve and as chairpersons.
These are: Policy and Resources, Councillor Robert Gould; Social Work,
Mary Beckett; Commercial Operations, Direct Labour Organisations, Denis
Murphy; Finance, Eamon Fitzgerald; General Purposes, Mohammed Sarwar;
Personnel, William O'Rourke; Property Services, William Butler;
Licensing Committee, Audrey Strain; Licensing Board, Jim Coleman;
Education, Malcolm Green; Housing, James McCarron; Roads, Charles
Gordon; Parks and Recreation, James Mutter; Planning, Patrick Lally;
Protective Services, Alex Mosson; Arts and Culture, Frank McAveety.

THE Nigerian ferry Princess Olayinka, with 727 passengers and 55 crew
members aboard, was drifting without power off the coast of Ghana last
night.
A spokesman for rescue co-ordinators at Falmouth coastguard said the
ship was trying to put down anchors on the seabed and was maintaining
good communications with the local Tema radio station in Ghana.
Initial fears that the vessel was about to run aground were being
played down late last night. Two ships, a Ghanian warship and a French
cargo vessel, are expected to take everyone off the vessel at daylight
and a tug will then tow the ship to the nearest port.
The passengers are all believed to be Nigerian and Cameroon.
The ship's distress call, asking for immediate assistance, was
intercepted by the rescue co-ordination centre at Stavanger in Norway,
which launched an international rescue alert.
Coastguards at Falmouth last night were broadcasting to any vessels in
the area in an attempt to redirect them to the stricken vessel, believed
to be in the Bay of Benin.
A spokesman said: ''If you are drifting with no power and no emergency
generator, any waters are dangerous.
''We do not know what the waters there are like but it is close to the
shore and the likelihood of the ship going ashore could be a problem --
whether there are three, 30, 300, or 3000 people on board,'' the
Falmouth spokesman said.
The ship is not listed in Lloyds but according to local reports, is
Nigerian-owned and operating as a ferry.
It is believed to have been heading from Nigeria to Liberia.

<HEADLINE>Major left bruised by Euro-sceptics. Lamont tells Premier to 'get off the fence'</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister suffered a bruising private meeting with more than
50 of his critics on European policy last night. He told them at the end
of 80 minutes of talks: ''Of course, I am persuadable.''
The majority of the Tory back benchers in his room at the Commons were
pressing him to say ''never'' to a single European currency.
However, he argued that this would destroy his bargaining position
with his 14 European partners.
Significantly, about 20 Euro-sceptics emerged from the meeting more or
less satisfied with the position he took.
However, the rest, including former Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman
Lamont, were still highly critical. Two further senior Tory back
benchers, Sir Nicholas Bonsor and Sir Ivan Lawrence, declared to Mr
Major that if he said ''no'' now to a single currency, the electorate
would love it and it would distance the Tories from the Labour Party.
The Prime Minister addressed the meeting quietly for 20 minutes and
then threw himself open to questions, some of which were intensely
hostile.
Mr Lamont, who has been talked of as a ''stalking horse'' leadership
challenger in the autumn, told Mr Major: ''If it was up to me, I would
say no, never, to a single currency now.'' His message to the Prime
Minister was 'get off the fence and decide'.
Earlier, the Prime Minister was accused of dithering by Labour leader
Tony Blair in the Commons. He seized on Baroness Thatcher's sweeping
criticisms of her successor and mocked Mr Major as being not the ''yes,
yes man'', but the ''don't know, don't know man.''
The Prime Minister retorted that nothing had changed in regard to his
thinking on the key political issue of a European single currency and
whether Britain should join it.
Mr Blair insisted: ''Nothing has changed? -- does that include in the
next Parliament, Yes or no?''.
The Prime Minister countered: ''Can you tell me when the matter will
come to a decision? You cannot. When the matter comes to a decision we
will decide.''
Mr Blair was exploiting Mr Major's difficulties with his own
Euro-sceptics with whom he was about to meet: ''When are you going to
learn to give a lead on this issue, because it is too important to be a
placing either of the rival ambitions in your Cabinet, or the warring
factions in your party -- of whom, increasingly, you are the prisoner
and not the master.''
Mr Major's hostile critics on the Tory benches took on this theme at
the private meeting of the Thatcherite ''Fresh Start'' group, whose
membership is now expanding towards 100 Tory back benchers.
At this meeting, the Prime Minister was candid. His message was that
he could not commit himself to a single currency one way or another when
it is at least four years away from a decision.
If he did so now, the Brussels Commission and his heads of government
colleagues might shut him out of key financial decisions, including the
apportioning of EU funds to British regions.
All those present were aware that he might also lose five of his
Cabinet colleagues if he were to take that stance now.
The Prime Minister was interrupted several times by cries of ''not
true'', and ''you may not be in power by then'' -- but Mr Major remained
calm, although some present described him as looking ''white-faced''
towards the end of the meeting.
He told them that the preliminary decisions about European integration
may not now take place before the next General Election.
He won a passive agreement when he said that he had no reservations
about giving the European Parliament more powers as a check on the
activities of the European Commission.
Mr Major repeated his argument that the mood in Europe is moving
Britain's way as regards to further integration.
He pointed out that Mr Jacques Delors has been replaced by Mr Jacques
Santer as the Commission President, that Mr Mitterrand had been replaced
by Mr Chirac in France and that the German people and the Bundesbank
were highly sceptical about a single currency in this century.
Furthermore, the German Parliament now would have the final decision
about a single currency and a central European bank.
The Fresh Start group seemed to divide afterwards on the result of
this meeting. Mr Lamont, Mr Bill Cash and many others were concerned
mainly to keep up the pressure on Mr Major to maintain his gradually
building Euro-scepticism.
For this reason, those like Mr John Carlisle and Mr Nicholas Budgen
were lambasted afterwards for taking a more favourable view of Mr
Major's performance.
There seemed to be a growing awareness that the Prime Minister is
within his rights to ask his party to trust him on his strategy -- and
when he said, ''I am persuadable'', it was judged by some to mean that
if, as a General Election approaches, he deemed it right to denounce a
single currency for Britain, it must be left in his hands to do so.
Afterwards, some present at the meeting acknowledged the logic of the
Prime Minister's position, particularly as he is as keen as any of them
to establish ''clear blue water'' between Tory and Labour for the next
election.
Some even agreed that if he committed himself now against a single
currency with all its loss of sovereignty potential he would be giving
Mr Blair time to take up the same position.
In due course, the Prime Minister will be obliged to have a similar
meeting with pro-European Tory back benchers at which he will have to
persaude them that he is still wanting to put Britain at the heart of
Europe.
Last night, Mr Major was maintaining his position on the fence on the
most crucially divisive issue for the Tory Party.

THE Prime Minister yesterday mounted a fresh attack on Opposition
plans for Scottish and Welsh assemblies, branding them
''ill-thought-out'' and ''incomplete''.
To Tory cheers, Mr Major told MPs that if the Opposition knew the
answers,''they're keeping quiet.
''If they don't know the answers, it is about time they produced those
answers before they seek to inflict such a disastrous policy on the
UK.''
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, Sir Michael
Hirst, yesterday seized on remarks by the President of the European
Parliament in apparent support of devolution, claiming his was ''either
misinformed or misguided.''
Sir Michael was furious at the ''meddling'' in British constitutional
affairs by President Claus Hansch, interviewed at the weekend after a
visit to the Europa Institute at Edinburgh University.
''Claus Hansch is either misinformed or misguided if he honestly
believes that devolution will give Scots a stronger voice in Europe than
it currently enjoys,'' said Sir Michael. ''Nothing could be further from
the truth.''
He told North-East Fife Conservative Association: ''Scotland's
membership of the Committee of the Regions would not be enhanced through
devolution. As a full and equal partner in the UK, Scotland is currently
one of the key players in Europe. Scottish Office Ministers directly
represent our interests in EU discussions.
''A devolved assembly would only serve to undermine our influence and
would reduce Scotland's status in the EU.''
However, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson hit back, saying:
''The fact that the top elected politician in Europe supports Labour's
devolution policy must be a deep embarrassment to Tories and
Nationalists alike.
''Our plan, with a devolved Scottish Parliament playing its part in
Europe side-by-side with the clout of Labour Britain gives Scotland the
best of both worlds. Sir Michael, yet another failed Tory politician,
would be best to listen to an authentic and authoritative voice in
Europe.''
SNP chief executive Michael Russell countered: ''There is no doubt
that the president of the European Parliament and every other European
politican would accept that the strongest and best clout that can come
in Europe is as an independent state.
''George Robertson is clutching at straws to bolster up a weak case
which would give Scotland scarcely more than it has at present.''
However, Sir Michael said Labour intended to give Scotland merely
observer status at the Council of Ministers, whereas as partners in the
UK we presently had full voting rights. He gave the example of Sir
Hector Monro attending meetings ''not as a decoration or an observer,
but as a participant.''
He added: ''In effect Labour's devolution policy would take Scotland
off the playing field and put us into the spectators' stand. This may be
acceptable to the President of the European Parliament but it is not
acceptable to me nor to most Scots.''

THE life of eccentric 1960s cult figure Vivian Stanshall had
degenerated into a spiral of self-destruction before he died in a blaze
at his home, an inquest heard today.
Musician and comic innovator Mr Stanshall, 52, of Hillfield Park,
Muswell Hill, north London, was found burned to death in bed on March 5
after neighbours called firefighters to his blazing second-floor flat.
The night before the fire, Mr Stanshall -- lead singer of the 1960s
group The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band -- had been drinking vodka and beer
with friends at home.
Fire investigators believed the blaze was started either by a lamp
placed too close to rubbish on the bedroom floor or by a discarded
cigarette, Hornsey Coroners Court was told.
Mr Stanshall, who was so badly burned that he had to be identified by
dental records, was almost four times over the drink-driving limit.
There were also traces of valium in his body.
Pathologist Professor David Bowen said: ''It seems likely that Mr
Stanshall had been overcome by the effects initially of drugs and
alcohol which would probably make him very drowsy and unable to respond.
I don't think he would have suffered. I think he would have been
unconscious.''
Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Dr William Dolman
said: ''Some 25 years ago, he was a man of some fame. At the very least,
it would be said that here was a very colourful character, a man who led
a picaresque life but probably, one might say that, for up to 20 years,
his life had followed a downhill path.''
Busker Rupert Grant, of Muswell Hill, north London, said he and
another friend, Ricky Campbell, arrived at Mr Stanshall's flat for one
of their regular drinking sessions.
''I think he was drunk before I got there. He'd often have a couple of
bottles of vodka on the side and he had some beer as well. He was lying
on the bed when I left and was smoking.''
The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, which was formed in 1965, had its biggest
hit with I'm The Urban Spaceman, which reached number five in the
charts.

SOCIALITE Lady Colin Campbell was given a public apology and
''substantial'' damages in the High Court yesterday over newspaper
allegations that she was born a boy and underwent a sex change.
The undisclosed financial settlement was believed to involve an
estimated #300,000 legal bill -- #50,000 damages plus costs -- for
Evening Standard publishers Associated Newspapers.
Lady Colin's QC, Mr Patrick Milmo, told the court that in March 1992,
following publication of her book, Diana in Private -- The Princess
Nobody Knows, the Evening Standard stated that she had been ''born and
raised as a man''.
This was despite a written undertaking given by Associated Newspapers
in 1989 not to repeat the wrongful allegation, originally made in the
1970s, that she had undergone a sex-change operation.
She issued a libel writ but, in September 1992, the newspaper
published another article stating that her ex-husband Lord Colin
Campbell -- brother of the Duke of Argyll -- found out she had been
brought up as a boy only by reading about it in the press and took
immediate steps to obtain a separation and divorce.
The newspaper now accepted this was all untrue.
Mr Milmo said Lady Colin was born in Jamaica in 1949. She was
incorrectly assigned male gender and registered as a boy. From an early
age, it was perfectly apparent that she was a girl and, at the age of
21, her birth certificate was amended.
Ever since the breakdown of her marriage in 1975, press stories had
appeared about the unusual circumstances of her upbringing, including
articles published by Associated Newspapers suggesting she had undergone
a sex change in order to assume a female identity.
Associated Newspapers now accepted without qualification or
reservation that she was born female, that her birth registration was an
error, and that it was ''both wrongful and extremely hurtful'' to imply
otherwise.
Lady Colin had also sued her ex-husband but the court heard he lived
in America and had not been served with the proceedings.

Strasbourg
SCOTTISH Euro-MPs last night claimed victory over the European
Commission after it announced it was scrapping plans to make fishing
boat skippers pay for hygiene checks.
Dr Allan Macartney (North-East Scotland -- SNP) said: ''Common sense
has prevailed. This is good news for the Scottish fishing industry and
good news for democracy."
Mr Hugh McMahon (Strathclyde West -- Lab.) said: ''This is excellent
news, just what we have been demanding. This will save the industry #4m
a year."
Euro-MPs from all parties united in anger at plans by the commission
to impose hygiene checks on fishing vessels and to treat fish catches
under rules used for checking meat. Dr Macartney said the commission had
acted ''deviously'' and had tried to slip the measures through a back
door.
Mr McMahon said the proposal would have cost jobs, cut prices paid to
fishermen and increased the price of fish to consumers. The Scottish
fishing industry, already in trouble because of dwindling stocks and
facing competition from more Spanish and Portuguese boats next year,
would have been particularly affected. Scots boats take about 70% of the
British catch.
Euro-MPs had accused the commission of using ''underhand and
secretive'' methods to impose the charges through a draft directive.
''The commission did not even consult the European Parliament about this
extra charge," Mr McMahon said.
Mr Franz Fischler, Agriculture commissioner, had proposed a new
Fishery Products Directive under which fish catches would have been
subject to hygiene checks already carried out free in the United
Kingdom. It was felt by some Euro-MPs that Mr Fischler was merely
wishing to extend a system already used in Germany to the whole of the
European Union's fishing states.
Euro-MPs were particularly annoyed at the method employed by Mr
Fischler whom they accused of trying to use meat regulations to cover
fish because of bureaucratic convenience.
Diplomats gathering for a routine agenda-setting session for a
Council of Ministers meeting announced the change of mind last week
after Mr Fischler informed them the commission would not proceed.
Mrs Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands -- SNP) said the commission
had been exposed for trying to push through a ''most arrogant red tape
absurdity.'' She said: ''The whole fish processing industry was at risk
and many small businessmen could have gone to the wall.'' She said the
European Parliament had sent the commission ''home to think again.''

A DECISION on plans for a #90m re-development of the 47-acre Glasgow
Garden Festival site at Pacific Quay was delayed for two weeks
yesterday.
Glasgow District Council's planning sub-committee on development
control continued consideration of an application for outline planning
from Edinburgh-based Miller Developments Ltd -- backed by Glasgow
Development Agency as a bid for funding from the Millennium Commission
-- after a rival application for the site was submitted.
The GDA plans are for a national science centre, a 100ft Millennium
Tower, a business park, and leisure facilities including a large-format
cinema and planetarium, a business park, a hotel, restaurants, and a
bridge across the Clyde.
The rival proposal comes from Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 Ltd and
incorporates the GDA idea for a science centre and the Millennium Tower
but also includes a tropicarium and a maritime-heritage centre.
Planning chairman Councillor Hugh Macrae, moving continuation, said he
felt it would be a good idea if the city could benefit from an amalgam
of the best from both schemes.
The Millennium Commission is to announce tomorrow its latest tranche
of projects being considered for financial support.
Should one of the projects not appear on the list, then the council's
decision would be made much easier.
The GDA-led consortium is seeking #40m from the Millennium Commission
and hopes to secure #50m from local authorities and the private sector.
A GDA spokesman said it was pleased that officials had supported its
application.
Mr Geoffrey Jarvis, director of Clyde Festival Gardens 1999, said its
proposal depended on securing #50m of Millennium funding, #20m in EU
grants, and #12m from private sources.
Professor John Ward, chairman of CBI Scotland and Campbell Christie,
general secretary of the STUC, were at Westminster yesterday to lobby in
support of the GDA-led Millennium bid.

<HEADLINE>The 'fiasco of incompetence' over arms destined for Iran</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>977895685</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
WEAPONS made by a company of which Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan
Aitken was for a time a director may have been destined for Iran, Board
of Trade President Michael Heseltine told the Commons yesterday.
But he said BMARC's trade, which could have breached the Government's
arms embargo, was not spotted owing to a failure of communication in
Whitehall.
Labour seized on his statement, with Shadow Trade and Industry
Secretary Dr Jack Cunningham protesting it uncovered ''an astonishing
story'' about ''this latest fiasco of negligence and incompetence on
behalf of ministers, not just officials''.
Mr Heseltine told MPs a check on the British Manufacturer and Research
Company's export licence applications between 1986-89 showed 36% ''did
not enclose the full supporting documentation''.
He emphasised Mr Aitken had told the House on March 30 that ''he was
never given any indication or information which could suggest that
BMARC's contract with Singapore might subsequently result in components
being shipped to Iran''.
Mr Heseltine, who said his statement was prompted by parliamentary
questions from Labour MPs, disclosed that Customs and Excise were now
studying whether export control offences had been committed in the BMARC
case.
He said rules had been tightened up. His department would co-operate
if MPs wanted to examine the issues thrown up by the BMARC case.
He later declared: ''There is a world of difference to saying that
people deliberately connived or covertly ignored, and what appears to be
the interpretation of the evidence I have put to the House. . . that a
limited number of issues escaped the net and connections were not made
in every case as a result of intelligence that might have been
differently interpreted.''
Mr Aitken, who was in the House to hear Mr Heseltine's statement, was
a non-executive director of Grantham-based BMARC from September 1988 to
June 1990.
He became embroiled in controversy this year after claims the company
supplied naval guns to Iran via Singapore in a 1986-89 venture known as
Project Lisi.
Mr Heseltine told MPs: ''Mr Aitken has already made his position clear
in a statement to the House during Treasury questions on March 30 when
he said that he was never given any indication or information which
could suggest that BMARC's contract with Singapore might subsequently
result in components being shipped to Iran.''
Mr Heseltine said BMARC was owned by Swiss defence contractor Oerlikon
until May 1988 when it was acquired by the UK firm, Astra. But BMARC
continued to make equipment to meet orders from Oerlikon.
In 1986, intelligence was obtained that Iran had concluded a contract
with Oerlikon to supply weaponry and ammunition, he said.
In 1987, it was revealed naval guns made by Oerlikon had been offered
to Iran by a company in Singapore.
In July and September 1988, further intelligence reports referred to
naval guns and ammunition being supplied by Oerlikon through Singapore
to Iran.
Mr Heseltine said: ''I must emphasise that none of the intelligence
reports mentioned BMARC.''
He said BMARC enclosed information on its Oerlikon orders with its
export licence application forms before being granted licences for the
export of similar naval guns and ammunition to Singapore during 1986-89.
Two of the successful applications -- for naval guns in 1986 --
referred to a project which was mentioned in the 1986 intelligence.
Mr Heseltine said: ''It does appear that there may be grounds for
believing that the final destination of naval cannon made by BMARC could
well have been Iran.
''I have concluded that connections should have been made between the
intelligence reports naming Oerlikon and the BMARC licence applications
made in support of orders from Oerlikon.''
He said the Department of Trade and Industry did not receive the 1986
intelligence and so could not have made any links.
It did get the 1988 information, which mentioned Oerlikon's trade with
Iran, but failed to connect it with BMARC's export licence applications.
Mr Heseltine said he understood the relevant intelligence now had been
passed to Customs, as the investigating authority.
Mr Heseltine then turned to allegations made by the former chairman of
Astra, Gerald James, that Project Lisi involved the supply of armaments
by BMARC to Singapore for transmission to Iran.
Mr Heseltine said Mr James's claims were passed on to Customs and
Excise in November 1991.
Customs then decided the allegations did not justify a full
investigation.
Mr Heseltine disclosed Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman had
written to Mr Brian Wilson, Labour trade and industry spokesman, in
response to questions Mr Wilson had asked in April about arms exports to
Iran.
The response included further information about ''the handling within
the Ministry of Defence of the available intelligence and BMARC export
licences for Singapore''.
Mr Heseltine noted that a DTI official wrote to Mr Aitken's private
secretary on April 5 about the information available to the department
in the late 1980s about the destination of the BMARC exports.
''The letter was based on infomation believed then to be accurate. But
the detailed enquiries I subsequently set in hand, and which I have
described to the House today, now show a different picture.''
He said the Government would want to consider carefully any Scott
inquiry recommendations on export licensing and the use of intelligence.
Mr Heseltine noted his statement followed research he had requested
when he felt in April he did not have sufficient information to answer
Mr Wilson's questions properly.
Dr Cunningham praisedt the persistence of Mr Wilson and Mr Jim Cousins
(Lab Newcastle Central) and told Mr Heseltine that without it ''this
latest fiasco of negligence and incompetence on the part of Ministers,
not just officials, I emphasise, would never have come to light.''
Dr Cunningham said the background to ''this astonishing story''
uncovered by Mr Heseltine was the guidelines on arms sales announced to
the Commons by Lord Howe when he was Foreign Secretary.
Lord Howe, then Geoffrey Howe, had said Britain should continue to
refuse to supply lethal equipment to either side in the Iran-Iraq war
and should not approve orders for defence equipment.
''Finally, and most devastatingly of all, Lord Howe told the House
that the Government would 'in line with this policy, continue to
scrutinise rigorously all applications for export licences'.
''We know that, far from upholding any of those guidelines, Ministers
and officials covertly ignored them all.''
Dr Cunningham demanded: ''Why was it that the ministers responsible
were not asking any searching questions at all of their officials about
the course of events?''
Mr Heseltine said Dr Cunningham had ''overstated and in many ways
misrepresented'' the issue.
Mr Heseltine declared: ''What is clear beyond question is that the
arrangements did not prove to be water-tight. That is something that Sir
Richard Scott is exploring and examining.''
Mr Brian Wilson told the House: ''This is not so much a matter for
select committees but one of old-fashioned integrity, which requires
resignations.
''Isn't the truth of this matter that BMARC knew that lethal
equipments were being sold illegally to Iran via Singapore, that the DTI
knew that the arms were being sold illegally to Iran via Singapore, that
Ministers knew, that Mr Aitken knew, that these were being illegally
sold?''
He pressed Mr Heseltine: ''Can we have a far more wide-reaching
inquiry than anything you have suggested today?''
Mr Heseltine replied: ''We have conducted a very detailed examination
into a range of very serious matters.''
Former Defence Secretary Tom King (Con -- Bridgwater) said it was
right for the matter to be investigated by the Trade and Industry Select
Committee but the Intelligence and Security Committee would be
interested to look at it as well.
Nick Harvey, for the Liberal Democrats, asked for an independent
inquiry into what was known by BMARC directors about the sale of arms.
Mr Heseltine replied he had referred all matters on this issue to
Customs and Excise.
Mr Cousins said that if 36% of BMARC's export licences were not filled
in correctly they were ''in breach of the export control order system''.
He claimed that the Department of Trade and Industry had ''conspired
and colluded in that breach''.
Mr Cousins asked: ''Who knew? Who benefited? How is Mr Aitken ever to
clear his name in the face of this disgrace, this dishonour and these
deceits and is it not time for Scott Two?''
Mr Heseltine said the figures he had given for the incorrectly
answered export licence applications by BMARC included time when Mr
Aitken was not a director.
Labour's Stephen Byers (Wallsend) asked Mr Heseltine for details of
documents which he claimed were hidden by a so-called ''gagging'' order
-- a public interest immunity certificate signed by Mr Aitken.
He asked Mr Heseltine: ''Will you accept that Mr Aitken was prepared
to see the innocent directors of Matrix Churchill go to jail rather than
disclose documents that would have been politically damaging to
himself?''
Mr Heseltine said the matter was now in the hands of the Scott inquiry
and it was now for Sir Richard Scott to publish ''comments as he sees
appropriate''.
Sir David Steel (LibDem -- Tweeddale, Ettrick, and Lauderdale) said
the issue went much deeper than just ''form-filling or lack of it'' in
the Department for Trade and Industry.
He said: ''Ministers presided over a period when a war was raging
between Iran and Iraq, and there was a sudden increase in export licence
demands from government departments in this country to innocent places
like Singapore.
''Did nobody put two and two together in the Government?''
Mr Heseltine said he had asked these sort of questions himself and he
said that one of the reasons in the increasing demand for export
licences was increasingly complicated computer technology.

A PROTEST to mark the 100th day of a campaign against live animal
exports from the port of Brightlingsea in Essex ended with 68 arrests
yesterday. Alleged offences included threatening behaviour, criminal
damage, and wilful obstruction of the highway.
Police mounted a major operation with 250 officers after warnings that
the anniversary would attract protesters from all over the country.
Assistant Chief Constable Geoffrey Markham said the demonstration was
a success for both police and protesters.
''It was reasonably peaceful. Those arrested had declared their
intention to be arrested before the event.''
Around 500 campaigners took part in yesterday's protest but no-one was
hurt in the few minor scuffles as police removed or persuaded people
sitting in the street leading to the port to clear the road.
Two lorries carrying calves and 300 sheep for export abroad got
through the town in about half an hour.
Protest co-ordinator Jimmy Johns said: ''I believe it all went very
well, considering how long this demonstration has been running and the
problems they have faced in Brightlingsea.''
Mr Markham said there would normally have been only 50 or so officers
controlling the daily protests.
''When you think there were 250 officers here from stations all over
the county, it meant that there were things which should have been done
today which remain undone.''
The costs of policing Brightlingsea had now reached #2m, he added.

A BOY died last night after falling almost 200ft down a cliff while
playing with friends near his home in Aberdeen.
Richard Steven Clark, 13, of Caisedykes Crescent, who was a third-year
pupil at Kincorth Academy, was airlifted from the cliff face by an RAF
helicopter.
The operation also involved Aberdeen lifeboat, coastguards, the fire
brigade, and ambulance, but he was found to be dead shortly after his
arrival at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
He had been playing a game with his friends when he slid over the edge
of the cliff, near Loirston Avenue in the village of Cove, and plunged
down the cliff face.
The rocky coastline made it impossible for a rescue by sea and
eventually an RAF helicopter from Lossiemouth was able to winch down a
crew member and a paramedic to tend to the boy and enable him to be
lifted into the helicopter for the short journey to the hospital.

<TEXT>
A FORMER housemaster at a boarding school for the sons of services
personnel, who sexually abused boys in his care, has been jailed for 10
years.
St Albans Crown Court was told that Allen Meredith began his
perversions at a school in Surrey and, despite the alarm being raised,
moved on to a second school, where his activities continued.
At this school, for the sons of members of people serving in the
forces, in Hertfordshire, he was given a formal warning about his
conduct and, in June 1991, following complaints from four members of
staff, he was interviewed by the headmaster and the chairman of the
board of governors.
However, no action was taken and he still continued to have boys in
his room, said Mr Phillip Matthews, prosecuting.
A psychiatrist who said that Meredith had suffered from ''stunted
emotional growth'' made it plain in a report that his personality is
never likely to change and he will never be considered safe in the
company of children.
Jailing him yesterday, Judge Colin Colston, QC, said: ''Anyone who has
heard details of this case cannot be other than horrified and revolted
at what happened.''
Meredith, 48, of Blakes Avenue, Witney, Oxfordshire pleaded guilty to
two charges of buggery, one of attempted buggery, two of indecency with
a child, and one of indecent assault.
The charges were specimen counts for numerous episodes of sexual
assault between March 1983 and January 1994.
The five boys involved were aged between 9 and 12.
Meredith first worked as a care assistant at a school in Surrey where
one boy was abused. In 1989 he became a housemaster at the boarding
school.
Mr Matthews said Meredith selected ''favourites'' among the pupils and
would offer them treats like staying up later than other boys, chocolate
bars, and even cooking outside in the woods.
In return they would visit him in his room where he would often show
them pornographic magazines or a video, and then either indecently
assault them or, in two cases, have sex with them.
The prosecutor said that in 1985, there was a school and police
investigation into allegations in Surrey, but it did not result in a
prosecution. Meredith, however, left the school.
* At Belfast Crown Court yesterday, a Catholic priest who admitted he
plied boys with alcohol at an isolated cottage before sexually abusing
them, had sentence deferred until the judge reviews evidence in the
case.
Fr Daniel Curran, 44, described as an alcoholic, admitted 13 charges
over a four-year period up to March 1994, involving nine boys aged
between 11 and 13.
The offences included one attempted buggery, nine indecent assaults,
one gross indecency, and an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
The priest, of Bryansford Avenue, Newcastle, County Down, was serving
in St Paul's Church on Belfast's Falls Road at the time.
It is the second major paedophile scandal to hit the Catholic Church
in Northern Ireland in less than a year. Last June, Fr Brendan Smyth was
jailed for four years for sexually abusing children.
* At Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday,a 72-year-old former shipyard
worker was jailed for five years for a catalogue of child sex abuse
stretching back 44 years.
John Livingstone admitted subjecting one boy to sex acts four times a
week for five years, and confessed to indecent behaviour involving a
girl once a week for three years.
Livingstone, of Napier Terrace, Govan, Glasgow, pled guilty to
indecency offences involving three boys and three girls. The offences,
committed in various houses in Glasgow, dated back to 1951, and came to
light after he had been retired for several years.
* At the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, a chief security officer
who sexually abused two teenage boys was jailed for five years.
Robert Paterson, 41, who latterly lived in Peterhead, had pleaded
guilty to having illegal sex with the boys on different dates in a house
in Aberdeenshire.

Linford Christie was reappointed captain of Britain's European Cup
team yesterday but insisted he would quit athletics at the end of the
season. He blamed pressure from the media. The world, European, and
Olympic sprint champion was urged to think again by UK and world
athletics authorities but he maintained that he would not defend the
Olympic 100m title in Atlanta next year.

JUBILANT families of the six remaining British hostages in Bosnia
celebrated last night as the agony of the crisis appeared to be over.
But a new crisis loomed for the UN as the Muslim-led Bosnian army
gathered up to 30,000 troops about 12 miles north of Sarajevo.
''There's never been a massing of troops like this before in the
war,'' said a UN official. ''They clearly intend to strike towards
Sarajevo.''
Anxious British relatives, glued to TV news reports from Bosnia,
spotted their sons and husbands after news of the release was confirmed.
All but 14 of the last 144 UN hostages held by Bosnian Serbs headed
for freedom after intense pressure from Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic to end almost three weeks of confrontation with the UN.
A double-decker bus with 28 British, French, Polish, and Scandinavian
hostages left the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale for Serbia escorted by
Serbian state security chief Mr Jovica Stanisic.
After crossing the River Drina into Serbia, Mr Stanisic confirmed
there were six British hostages plus 16 French, two Polish, a Swede, a
Russian, a Czech, and a Norwegian.
A delighted Allan Warren, of Cardiff, recognised his sergeant son
Nick, 28, among the men being taken to freedom.
Fusiliers Richard Boardwell, 23, of Ruabon, Clwyd, and Simon
Mainwaring, 27, of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, were also sighted by
overjoyed relatives in the freed group leaving the Serb headquarters at
Pale.
It was expected that Fusiliers David Jones, 25, of Old Colwyn, Clwyd,
and Ricky Smith, 26, of Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan, together with RAF
Flt Lt Andrew Hall, 28, from Honington, Suffolk, were also on their way
to freedom.
Mr Stanisic said he expected the remaining 14 hostages to be freed by
the end of the week.
Dr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said: ''We consider this
crisis closed and we hope it will never happen again. We don't want to
fight. We want a new environment.''

GAS industry regulator Clare Spottiswoode is to receive a backdated
pay rise of #16,275 taking her salary to #90,000, Board of Trade
President Michael Heseltine announced last night.
The increase will give Ms Spottiswoode, 42, an effective increase of
#20,000 on her original salary of #70,000 in autumn 1993.
After increases in April 1994 and April 1995, the Ofgas
director-general's salary had reached #73,725 before the latest rise,
which is backdated to November 1994.
Mr Heseltine's disclosure of the move in a Commons written reply
sparked Labour fury, with the party's trade and industry spokesman Brian
Wilson saying: ''There is no justification for the regulator being
allowed to join in the privatisation pay trough.''
Ms Spottiswoode was said to have been asking for an increase to around
#110,000 to reflect her extra workload and to bring her pay into line
with that of other public service regulators.
Defending the pay rise, Mr Heseltine declared: ''I believe that
overall the proposed changes in Ms Spottiswoode's remuneration are
reasonable and fair in terms of both the changes to her own job and the
remuneration of other regulators.''
He acknowledged the Gas Bill, introducing competition in domestic gas
supply, would ''substantively increase'' Ms Spottiswoode's
responsibilities and workload.
0 Labour consumer affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths protested:
''Eighteen million gas consumers will be outraged at this unjustified
increase.
''Clearly ministers are colluding with British Gas and the regulator
and ignoring public concerns.''
He added: ''The regulator has gone from kitten to fat cat in one
bound.''

THE Strathclyde Tram should link the likes of Bearsden and Clarkston
rather than Maryhill and Easterhouse as proposed, Scotland's second
largest trade union argued yesterday.
It makes more sense to have a cross-river route, according to the
Transport and General Workers' Union, in a submission to regional
councillors about the #170m project.
The T&amp;G said a light-rail system over the Clyde would relieve traffic
congestion on the 11 other crossings into the city centre, including the
Kingston Bridge and Clyde Tunnel. It would also cut the number of cars
coming into the city by offering an attractive public transport
alternative to commuters.
The T&amp;G believes the proposed route between Maryhill and Easterhouse
through the city centre would increase rather than reduce car use. It
argues that an east-west link would embrace only those areas which have
low levels of car ownership and which are already well served by
profitable bus routes or heavily-subsidised train and underground
services.
The union fears that trams would hit bus profits, leading to service
cuts in loss-making routes -- which are, by definition, those areas with
high car ownership.
Consultant Mr Doug Harrison, author of the report used in the union's
response to Strathclyde's plan, confirmed that a Bearsden to Clarkston
tram route would be preferable.
Mr Jimmy Ellsby, Scottish regional secretary-designate, said: ''Since
one of the city's most pressing traffic problems is crossing the Clyde,
we believe it would make much more sense to put this new generation of
public transport -- with its enormous carrying capacity -- on a
cross-river route.''
The T&amp;G is also critical of proposals for more pedestrian-only streets
under the region's Millennium Plan for the city centre and public
transport. Mr Des Divers, the union's Glasgow passenger district
convener, said closing Argyle Street and Queen Street to buses would
leave a ''130-acre black hole'' in the city centre.

JAMES BOND had done his stuff, as usual. The naval guns and ammunition
we thought we were supplying to Singapore were, in fact, he discovered,
being passed on to Iran then at death grips with Iraq.
Heaven knows how many wily Orientals Bond had had to outwit, how many
vast Orientals skilled in the killing arts he had had to dispose of, how
many Oriental beauties he had felt obliged to sleep with to obtain this
information.
What happened to this top- secret info? It was recently discovered by
Mr Michael Heseltine in a Whitehall pigeon hole. The Department of Trade
and Industry, which was responsible for issuing arms export licences had
''failed to make the connection'' between the licences they were
granting to sell the stuff to Singapore and Bond's revelation.
Sometimes, we know, Bond wishes he had been ''licensed to kill'' his
superiors.
Still, he might have been proud of Mr Heseltine yesterday, having had
to keep his cool in some pretty sticky situations himself.
Never did Sir Jack Hobbs on the stickiest of wickets play a more
masterly innings than Mr Heseltine as he disclosed that not the naval
guns alone but, as far as he could tell, nearly three-quarters of
Britain's arms for export between 1986 and 1989, were waved through by
the DTI despite lacking full details of what was being exported. One of
the exporters had Mr Jonathan Aitken, now Chief Secretary to the
Treasury, as a non-executive director.
Rarely has a saga of administrative incompetence apparently unnoticed
by the Ministers supposed to be in charge been so lavishly laid before
MPs. If anything, the Opposition was in danger of indigestion through
being fed so many examples of things going wrong.
Dr Jack Cunningham, Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary, did not have
to strive for irony as he recalled the undertaking by the then Foreign
Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, that all arms export licences would be
''rigorously'' monitored. The system had certainly come under strain, Mr
Heseltine conceded.
In fact, he could not say it was watertight. He smoothly recalled how
some of Bond's information about arms going to Iran got through to DTI
and some had not.
Why? Were Smersh still entrenched in the corridors of Whitehall
waiting fo the Cold War to break out again.? Or was there an even more
sinister explanation?
The truth may come out, as Mr Heseltine indicated that about four
different bodies are now to seek the answer to those questions.
Mr Nick Harvey, for the Liberal Democrats -- applying the commonsense
which appeared to be at crisis levels of short supply in Whitehall asked
if it had not struck anyone involved in this massive licensing apparatus
that Singapore was a rather unlikely final destination for some of these
items.
SNP leader Alex Salmond, asking whether the responsible Ministers knew
these large-scale breaches of their Government's regulations were taking
place, was rather bafflingly told that it was difficult to see how they
could have done.
Even citizens prepared to excuse the Chancellor of the Excheqher for
not having read the Maastricht Treaty must have been perplexed at this
new vision of a Minister as a smaller version of the eighteenth-century
idea of the Almighty as one who, having created the universe, left it to
its own devices.
''We have put in place an export licensing system for arms which we
will operate rigorously. How is it actually doing? You cannot expect us
to know that.''
Questions from Labour MPs edged closer to Mr Aitken. Could he really
not have known that his company was actually or had actually or was
planning actually to sell arms to Iran? He had told the House of Commons
he did not know, said Mr Heseltine. That was the main part of his
defence of his position.
Mr Heseltine indicated that these events would not be investigated by
at least four bodies and said ''improvements'' had already been made in
implementing the licensing system.
One seemed to be that the exporter now has to give a ''full and
unambiguous statement'' of what the item will be used for and who is
going to end up using it. It made one wonder what the unimproved
rigorous monitoring had been like.
At one point, Mr Heseltine, who enjoyed the comparative advantage of
only taking the DTI over in 1990, permitted himself to get angry with Mr
Brian Wilson, the indefatigable MP for Cunninghame North, as prepared to
investigate mystery arms as ghost trains. Here he was, he cried, giving
a full and frank account to the House and being traduced for it. OO7
would have admired his nerve.

THE Prime Minister wants an examination of the distribution of the
National Lottery's capital and revenue.
However, he emphasised at Question Time that it would not be right to
look at the issue until the lottery had run for a longer period.
Mr Major also acknowledged that many people were concerned about the
size of lottery prizes in ''roll-over'' weeks, which include the
previous week's jackpot.
However, he added that contributions to the lottery and its good
causes rose dramatically in such weeks.
This week's double winners shared more than #22m.
Mr Major was replying to Labour's Kate Hoey (Vauxhall), who told him
there was ''growing concern'' about how the lottery was operating and
the ''huge profits'' that Camelot was making.

THE SNP's parliamentary leader, Mrs Margaret Ewing, last night tabled
a Commons motion attacking the Government for the rise in duty on a
bottle of whisky.
She claimed that since the Government imposed 26p on a bottle --
following withdrawal of the plan to raise VAT on domestic fuel to 17.5%
-- there had been a 26% slump in whisky sales this year.
Mrs Ewing said: ''The SNP was pleased to see the Government defeated
on the issue of 17.5% VAT on domestic fuel, but the defeat of this
anti-Scottish tax saw Chancellor Kenneth Clarke impose another
anti-Scottish tax on whisky.
''His actions were nothing but vindictive. In January, the SNP sought
to lower duty on whisky by 10%, in order to help create more jobs in an
industry where 300 jobs have been lost because distilleries have been
mothballed. The decline in sales only goes to show our argument was
right.''
SCOTTISH business leaders yesterday put their weight behind attempts
by the whisky industry to win a ''level playing field.''
CBI Scotland director Mr Lex Gold said it was important that the
Government took action to help the whisky industry.He said he agreed
with its concerns over the level of taxation on its product and European
controls on it.
His comments came after a meeting with Mr Hugh Morison, director
general of the Scotch Whisky Association.
Mr Morison said he was pleased with the support of CBI Scotland and
then attacked the Government for its ''lunatic'' handling of the whisky
industry.
Mr Morison said: ''Here is a very important industry which is heavily
concentrated in parts of Scotland which are disadvantaged in one way or
another.''
''It is pretty lunatic for a Government to discriminate against an
industry which is successfully based in these areas at the same time as
pouring vast amounts of taxpayers' money trying to encourage economic
development there.''

SCOTLAND has beaten off stiff opposition from Italy to host a
prestigious United Nations conference on mountains in the spring of next
year, it was announced yesterday.
Scottish environmentalists, who had been fighting a fierce campaign
against a last-minute bid by supporters of the autonomous province of
Trento in the Italian Alps, said the decision would make Scotland the
focus of European debate on mountain policy.
The conference, to be held in either April or May of next year, is
likely to be held in either Inverness or Aberdeen. It will examine the
current state of mountainous environments across Europe.
A follow-up conference will be held in Trento in September to agree a
programme of work.
Mr Dave Morris, Scottish officer of the Ramblers' Association and a
member of the International Union of Alpinist Associations' commission
on mountain protection, said the choice of the Highlands for the
conference would ''give Scotland an ideal platform from which to promote
new ideas of sustainable mountain development''.
The Scottish bid has attracted significant funding from a number of
sources: #20,000 from the Scottish Office; #10,000 from the Cairngorms
Partnership; #10,000 from Scottish Natural Heritage; and #15,000 from
the British Council.
The decision was announced yesterday by the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), one of the world's leading
environmental organisations, and the decision to give the lead
conference to Scotland, and its follow-up to Italy, is likely to be
greeted as a deft piece of diplomatic footwork.
Scotland was first recommended in February as the preferred location
but, since then, IUCN and UN officials have faced fierce lobbying from
Trento's supporters.
Only a flurry of last-minute campaigning by the Scottish Office and
Scottish environmentalists is thought to have saved the day.
In Scotland's favour was the fact that it belongs neither to
Scandinavia nor the alpine countries, leaving both these groups willing
to come to ''neutral'' territory.
The conference is one of a series of key inter-governmental meetings
aimed at fulfilling the commitment to preserve and enhance fragile
mountain eco-systems made at the 1992 United Nations Conference on the
Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.
The IUCN has for the past 15 years considered the state of Scotland's
mountain environment as of ''concern''. In 1980, in its World
Conservation Strategy, it highlighted the Scottish Highlands and Islands
as a priority for protected area action.
In the past year, however, the Cairngorms Partnership Board has been
set up by the Scottish Secretary.
That, coupled with recent purchases of wild land in the central
Cairngorms by voluntary organisations such as Mar Lodge Estate, bought
by the National Trust for Scotland, may give conference delegates the
opportunity to study at first hand new approaches to sustainable
mountain development.
The UK Government is also expected to put forward the Cairngorms for
World Heritage listing.

Court told of flight to Majorca as
half a million was 'spirited away'
GRAEME Souness's ex-wife ''looted'' half a million pounds from their
joint bank account like ''a thief in the night'', the former Rangers
manager's counsel told the High Court yesterday.
Lord Williams, QC, said that Danielle Souness flew to Majorca after
she left Souness in November 1988 and ''spirited away'' #533,693 to an
account where he could not touch it.
Mrs Souness, 39, told Mr Justice Morland and the jury that she asked
her father to remove the money because Mr Souness and his solicitor were
on their way to the island to do the same thing.
''I hadn't got a home or bank account except for that one. Those were
my only means. We had not yet agreed a settlement.''
She added: ''Graeme came in to do the same thing five minutes after my
father -- he was furious.''
Mrs Souness, who was divorced from her 42-year-old former husband last
year, was giving evidence on behalf of the People newspaper, which is
fighting his claim for ''massive'' damages over a story which branded
him ''tight-fisted'' and a ''dirty rat''.
In the May 1993 interview, for which she received #15,000, she alleged
he ordered her, their sons Fraser and Jordan, and adopted daughter
Chantelle, to leave the #1m Surrey home he had provided for them after
the marriage split by Christmas Eve 1992 .
She also claimed he refused to pay the boys' school fees, and that she
was living on handouts from her parents.
Mrs Souness denied Lord Williams's assertion that she ''ducked and
dived constantly'' when it came to answering questions about financial
matters and her ex-husband.
Publishers MGN Ltd deny libel and say the story about Mr Souness, of
Mere, Knutsford, Cheshire, is true.
Asked if Mr Souness had behaved like a ''dirty rat'' to Chantelle, Mrs
Souness's 20-year-old daughter by her first marriage, whom he adopted,
she agreed he was very generous to her.
Lord Williams said Mr Souness paid for her to go to Millfield, one of
the dearest schools in the country; bought her a horse called Tickled
Pink for #20,000; horse boxes for #30,000; driving lessons; a #10,000
car with a special number plate and portable phone; an open account at a
saddlery; a clothing allowance; horse-riding training at #150 per week
plus #50 a week pocket money; and made alterations to his home so that
she had a separate entrance.
Asked why she had not mentioned this ''extraordinary generosity'' to
the People, Mrs Souness, of Penhouse Close, Bramhall, Cheshire, said her
ex-husband had sold the lot while Chantelle was staying with her.
Lord Williams said Mr Souness had sold the horse because it would have
been too hot for it in Majorca, and the car because it was a right-hand
drive, and would not have been safe abroad.
Asked if she had told the People this, Danielle replied: ''No, but
neither did I talk about his treatment of Chantelle later on.''
She said she did not want to explain herself or bring her daughter
into it.
She denied she was pleased with the article, or that it was written
out of spite.
''I thought I had the right to tell my side of the story. But there's
no satisfaction in having to publicly state things which are private.''
She claimed she had to sell her jewellery to pay her bills.
In 1993, she sold her engagement ring to her father, who also bought a
#10,000 ruby ring which Mr Souness had given her.
She also sold a bracelet to her brother for #1500, and sold her gold
chains for #700.
''If Graeme had helped me, selling them wouldn't have been a
priority.''
Mrs Souness said the People's story was truthful if not entirely
accurate.
Asked if she used the phrase ''dirty rat'' to describe her ex-husband,
she said: ''Not in those words, but along those lines.''
She rejected Lord Williams's assertion that it was a ''pack of lies,
untruths and distortions''.
''If you take the article as a whole it's what I felt. When we were at
Norton Farm, I felt that for two years he'd put me through hell.
''I still think the general gist of the article is correct.''
Re-examined by Mr George Carman, QC, for the People, she said: ''To my
mind, it was a fair picture -- and that has remained my belief.''
The hearing was adjourned until today when counsel will make their
closing speeches to the jury.

TWO armed robbers who travelled from Germany to hold up a fast-food
restaurant in Dundee were each sentenced yesterday to five-and-a-half
years in a German jail.
Klaus Elten, 39, and Joachim Fischer, 37, held up a Group 4 security
van collecting the takings at the McDonald's drive-in on Kingsway on
July 5, 1993.
They made off with #8842 after threatening security men with a gun and
abandoning their stolen getaway car.
However, with the help of Interpol computers, the men were caught two
months later.
Elten and Fischer were convicted at Luneberg regional court after
Scottish officers travelled to Germany to present their evidence. Under
German law, suspects can be tried in their homeland for crimes committed
abroad.
The men had escaped after the robbery by taking the ferry from Hull to
Rotterdam.
Fischer was arrested in Germany in connection with other crimes.
Interpol computers linked him with the Dundee raid. Elten was tracked
down to France, where he was arrested. He escaped but was recaptured and
taken to Germany for trial.
Tayside police presented their case against the two men to the German
authorities, having established a link between the two men and Tayside.
Last night, Detective Chief Inspector Scott Robinson praised the
European co-operation that convicted the robbers.
He said: ''Interpol, the national criminal intelligence service, and
the forces of three countries were involved in this investigation. It is
an excellent example of international co-operation leading to a
successful result.''

<TEXT>
TWO young women from the Dounreay area whose lives have been blighted
by leukemia still hold the plant responsible despite years of official
denial.
Ms Mandy McVean, 26, from Thurso, Caithness, was 14 years old when she
was diagnosed as having contracted leukemia in 1983.
She qualified last week as a pharmacist at Robert Gordon's University
in Aberdeen, but still recalls vividly the painful radiotherapy she
underwent at Edinburgh's Western Infirmary and the chemotherapy at
Raigmore Hospital in Inverness over a three-year period in the
mid-1980s.
She said yesterday: ''I still blame Dounreay for causing my problem
with leukemia, although thankfully I have been 'in remission' for the
past eight years or so.''
Ms McVean, who next week starts her career as a pharmacist in
Worthing, Sussex, added: ''It does not surprise me in the least that
this new report pinpoints the waste-shaft as the likely source of the
radiation hot spots on the beaches.
''Nor am I surprised that the authors of the new report want to see
the contents of the shaft emptied. I think that will be a worthwhile
exercise because it should mean that future generations of young people
living up here will not have to go through the same kind of thing I
did.''
Ms Sharon Coghill, 24, lived at Murkle, 12 miles from Dounreay, when
she was positively diagnosed as having acute myeloid leukemia in 1980 as
a nine-year-old.
She said: ''I still firmly believe that my illness was caused by
radiation from Dounreay. It is too much of a coincidence that, when I
was in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in 1981, there were only three
other young leukemia patients undergoing treatment . . . and they were
all from the Thurso area near Dounreay.''
The civil servant, who now lives in Edinburgh and works in the
Scottish Office, said: ''I do not believe that it was a coincidence
either that this leukemia cluster followed hard on the heels of the 1977
explosion in the shaft, which blasted radioactivity round the area.''
She added: ''There is a feeling now among the people of Caithness that
they have been betrayed by the Atomic Energy Authority, and this has
become stronger with the recent revelations . . . and also now that not
so many are working at the Dounreay site.''
Recently the two women had to drop their action against the operators
at Dounreay because of ''legal aid difficulties''.

MORE than 1600 prisoners in Scotland are living two to a cell and more
than 100 three to a cell in rooms designed for one person, Scottish
Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said last night.
Lord James, in a Commons written reply, provided the figures given to
him by the Scottish Prison Service.
These show that, on Wednesday June 7, 1640 male and 18 female
prisoners were sleeping two to a cell and 96 male and six female
prisoners were sleeping in threes.
The prison with the highest three to a cell rate was Edinburgh's
Saughton, with 87 male prisoners involved.
Several prisons, including Peterhead, have no prisoners sharing
one-person cells.

THE Scottish Office confirmed last night that it has reduced late
completion penalties against the Italian consortium Castelli Girola over
an A74 upgrading debacle.
Original penalties for delays in meeting the contract have been
reduced from #250,000 a month to #150,000 a month after ''a
reassessment'' of the liquidated damages clause.
The Scottish Office denied it had been ''held to ransom'' to ensure
the upgrading was completed. A spokeswoman insisted the decision to
reduce penalty charges was taken for ''sound commercial reasons''.
In February, the Italian group -- already four months behind schedule
and facing a #1m bill for delays -- called in Edinburgh-based Morrison
Construction to complete all outstanding works on a 1.4 kilometre
section of road.
It is understood Castelli Girola will now be charged #600,000 in
damages for the delays to the project, due soon for completion.
However, its losses will still range from between #12m and #15m on the
#23.4m contract, according to estimates by the New Civil Engineer
magazine.
The Scottish Office is adamant that there is a logical explanation for
reducing the penalties, which have still to be agreed in negotiations
with Castelli Girola.
The cut was on grounds that the northerly section of road could not
have opened until about now anyway -- when Morrison Construction was due
to complete a tie-in interchange located at the Italian stretch of road.
The Government has been deeply embarrassed by the Italian contractors'
grim performance after awarding it the contract to upgrade a 6.5
kilometre stretch of dual carriageway to three-lane motorway at Annan,
Dumfriesshire.
In February, Morrison confirmed a #4m contract from Castelli Girola,
the British management subsidiary of two Milan firms, to complete works
between Eaglesfield and Kirkpatrick Fleming.
When bailing out the Italian group, Morrison was already well ahead
with an adjacent #13m design and build upgrading. However, it is
understood the firm also needed one section of the troubled Italian
stretch completed swiftly to gain access for work on the tie-in
interchange.
Castelli Girola's excuses for the massive over-running in a contract
supposed to last 20 months have concentrated upon bad weather. Joint
venture director Roberto Verni would not comment last night.
Several British firms which faced the same wintry conditions and
similar engineering challenges have not only completed other sections
ahead of schedule but are within budget.
Question marks remain over the choice of Italian firms working so far
away from base when other road-building firms with proven records closer
to home were willing and able to do the work.
According to NCE sources, even wrong excavating equipment was brought
in. Trucks, more suited to dry ground than the wet conditions
experienced, were frequently bogged down.
At one stage, the Scottish Office even advanced #1.75m to allow work
to continue after the money was frozen because of a series of arrestment
orders lodged by sub-contractors due payments for work on behalf of
Castelli Girola. It is understood the consortium's winning bid was less
than #1m below its nearest rival.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman argued the main issue has been to ensure
sub-contractors were paid and that the job, which ''ran into
difficulties'', was completed with the minimum of delay.

DOUNREAY'S director John Baxter told The Herald last night that it had
never been the plant's purpose to mislead anyone over the levels of
radioactive contamination from a shaft used for dumping waste.
He was reacting to the Comare/RWMAC report published yesterday which
suggested that continued contamination of the foreshore at Dounreay
originated in a shaft, where waste was dumped between 1958 and 1977,
when there was an explosion.
The report found that one of more than 100 particles found on the
Dounreay foreshore carried more radioactivity than Dounreay's total
estimate. However, Mr Baxter said: ''I have tracked back and I have not
found any intention to mislead Comare. There seems to have been some
confusion about some of the information that went out and the
interpretation of it. All I can say is I have done everything I can to
track back.
''I have taken in some of the retired employees to help us to make
sure we have as clear a picture as possible. Now I believe we should
work with Comare and RWMAC to find some solution.
''The most positive thing is that they find it very unlikely that any
of the discharges are associated with leukemia. I find that very
reassuring for the future.''
He estimated that it would take more than 10 years and up to #200m to
resolve the environmental problems posed by the shaft.
Scottish Health Minister Lord Fraser said last night he had noted
these conclusions and called on Dounreay's management to respond
positively to the report's recommendations.
However, he stressed: ''The Government remains most concerned that the
cause of the heightened incidence of childhood leukemia in the Dounreay
area should be established.''
Last night, anti-nuclear campaigner Mrs Lorraine Mann welcomed the
report. She said: ''I have never, ever seen such an up-front damning
indictment of any organisation in the nuclear industry as this document
represents.
''Every time we have raised any of these issues, we have been accused
of scaremongering by Dounreay. We have never gone so far as this report.
We realised things were bad but never in our worst nightmares did we
realise how bad they are.
''In this report, we see evidence of Dounreay having not told the
truth to Government organisations like Comare who were looking into the
leukemia cluster around Dounreay. That is the level of incompetence and
dishonesty we are dealing with. People should be outraged about what has
been done at Dounreay in the past 40 years.
''Dounreay have consistently hidden behind the Official Secrets Act.''
Mrs Mann said it was obvious that these particular particles were not
the leukemia source because anyone coming into contact with them would
become so ill as to be hospitalised within a few days.
''But Comare will still have to do a lot more work to find out which
aspects of Dounreay's discharges are a problem.''
Dr Derek Pooley, chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority's
Government Division, which is responsible for Dounreay, gave his
reaction to yesterday's report.
He said that a ''central task' for Dounreay's current managers was to
care for and, at the appropriate time, dismantle facilities which have
come from 40 years of pioneering nuclear developments at the site.
He said: ''One of these issues is the eventual elimination of the
radioactive particles we have been finding on the foreshore. Another is
the need to have a satisfactory long-term plan for the Dounreay waste
shaft''.
He said his organisation accepted yesterday's report but added: ''We
support the efforts by Dounreay's director Mr John Baxter and his team
in resolving these issues.''
Dr Pooley said he was pleased that the RWMAC team had been impressed
by the ''rigorous manner'' in which both the probes into the origins of
the ''hot-spot' particles and ''the wider contamination are now being
pursued''.
Local Liberal Democrat MP Bob Maclennan -- a strong supporter of
Dounreay's management until the problems around the dumping of
highly-radioactive wastes in the 216ft shaft surfaced -- said: ''If
Dounreay is to learn from this experience and to put itself at the
forefront of nuclear waste management technology, it is imperative that
the recommended investigation and the development of remedial measures
goes ahead immediately.''
He added that Dounreay's management must treat the recommendations in
the report ''with the utmost seriousness'' and called on the UKAEA's
Government Division to bring forward proposals as soon as possible for
dealing with the ''unsatisfactory'' shaft.
The Dounreay plant recently celebrated its 40th birthday.
It now employs 1400 people directly, only half the number at its peak
during the 1960s and 1970s.

TEN-YEAR-OLD David Oldcorn suffered extensive burns to his feet and
legs when he jumped into a natural sandpit which had been heated by an
underground fire.
The accident happened at Law, Lanarkshire, where it is believed the
fire has taken hold in underground coal workings. Firefighters, using
probes, yesterday measured the surface temperature at 430C. Sand was
said to be ''bubbling''.
The area was part of Law Colliery, which closed in 1934. The colliery
is now wooded over and used by people to walk dogs and as a play area
for children.
The accident happened on Friday, when David was taken to hospital in
Glasgow, but it was not until yesterday that emergency services were
told of the fire.

A SENIOR education authority official yesterday expressed severe doubt
about the future of a Government scheme to give trainee secondary school
teachers more training in the classroom and less in college.
The scheme, which involves secondary teachers acting as mentors who
will supervise, train, and assess college of education students in
school, is due to be introduced in August.
But Mr Keir Bloomer, head of personnel in Strathclyde region's
education department, said: ''It now seems clear to me that it is not
going to get off the ground in the form intended by the Scottish Office
in the next session. It will have to be put back to the Scottish Office
to sort out.''
Earlier the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association, which has about
3000 members in Strathclyde region schools, announced that it would
ballot them shortly after the beginning of the new session in August on
a boycott of the scheme unless agreement was reached on an
''acceptable'' form of mentoring which was allocated more resources.

A SENIOR Royal College of Nursing officer hit back last night over
Government-inspired claims that the college had sold out the principle
of refusing local bargaining with NHS trusts.
The announcement of a deal last week has led to suggestions of a
breach in the college's alliance with the other major health union,
Unison, which is fighting to maintain the principle of national pay
deals.
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley's part of the ''bargain'' was to
order trust managements to remove any strings they had attached to
whatever top-up they were offering on the Government's national award of
1%. The health unions want 3% all round.
The college's Scottish secretary, Ms June Andrews, said it still
supported the principle of national bargaining.
''After the announcement, I had to call the Scottish Office and tell
it we are not ready to negotiate. Our position is the same as it was in
February -- we want 3% for every nurse, with no strings attached, and a
guarantee of a fair deal next year,'' she said. ''Our ballot on
industrial action goes ahead.
''We do not like strings and we got Mrs Bottomley to call them off. We
have gone a long way in this fashion without dealing with trust
managements.
''What we have told Mrs Bottomley is that when the number of trusts
offering 3% without strings reaches a critical mass, we will accept
these and target the ones that are left.
''That does not mean we will be negotiating with them. We will be
putting pressure on them. We will be pointing out to Mrs Bottomley that
they are still not offering 3%, or they are keeping strings attached,
and we will expect her to make sure they fall into line.''
Ms Andrews did not accept that this would tie the college to the
principle of local deals next year. She said: ''Our pay review body will
be starting to gather evidence for next year in about eight weeks' time.
If it wants to recommend local pay deals, it will have to look at the
matter afresh.''
Ms Andrews held Health Minister Gerald Malone at least partly to blame
for misleading trust managers, other unions, the public, even some of
his own members, by insisting that a huge step forward had been made
last week.
However, Mrs Bottomley's order to take the strings from their offers
has already left many trust managers high and dry, after having made
offers calculated on the basis of savings they could make by attaching
strings -- like the reduction of premium payments for public holidays
and weekends.

STRATHCLYDE yesterday lost a court bid to lay down the law on the
level of rail services within the region after privatisation.
Lord Cameron refused to grant an interim interdict to the region and
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive which was aimed at enforcing
an existing agreement with British Rail.
The agreement, which is due to expire on September 30 this year, gives
the region the right to decide the frequency, timings, standards, type,
and capacity of trains on lines for which it provides a #30m a year
subsidy.
As a result of the 1993 Railways Act, the lines in Strathclyde will be
under the control of Railtrack and, to run trains, BR will have to agree
access with Railtrack. The access contract will have to be approved by
the new Rail Regulator, Mr John Swift, QC.
Negotiations over the access contract have been going on since last
summer and Railtrack submitted the proposed access contract to the
regulator in April this year.
Strathclyde told Lord Cameron that it did not want a court order to
prevent negotiation and completion of a track access contract between
Railtrack and BR.
It was seeking an interdict to prevent a contract being agreed which
would disable BR from fulfilling its present contractual obligations
under section 20 of the 1968 Transport Act.
Privatisation will allow train operators other than BR to use lines in
Strathclyde and the region fears that the final access contract will not
allow BR enough use of the track to provide all the services specified
under the current agreement.
The region says the timetable which BR has apparently negotiated with
Railtrack, essentially involving a number of trains per day without
specifying frequency or departure times, is not enough to guarantee
current levels of service and may lead to a poorer service for rail
users.
Strathclyde argues that the current set-up has allowed the region to
operate the largest suburban rail network in the UK outside London.
BR pointed out that, before any access agreement came into operation,
it had to have the approval of the Rail Regulator, who was consulting
interested parties, such as Strathclyde region and the SPTE. It added
that the regulator has submitted copies of the proposed access contract
to the region and the SPTE and had asked for their comments.
Lord Cameron, who heard a day of legal argument in the case, said
yesterday that, until the Rail Regulator had approved the access
contract, BR and Railtrack were bound to fulfil their obligations under
the section 20 agreement.
In all the circumstances, he did not consider that Strathclyde and the
SPTE had shown any justification for granting an interdict in the terms
sought.
After the decision, Mr Alex Lynch, ScotRail's director of finance,
said he was pleased with the terms of the ruling, which seemed to accord
with BR's understanding of the role of the regulator and the contractual
framework set up by the 1993 Railways Act.
A spokesman for Strathclyde said: ''The council will examine the
judgment in detail before deciding what action should be taken.''

HIGHLAND Regional Council yesterday appealed to the chairman and chief
executive of the British Railways Board, Mr John Welsby, to remove any
doubt over the summer operation of the Fort William sleeper.
The move followed the disclosure that ScotRail was not accepting
bookings for the sleeper after June 30.
Council convener Duncan McPherson said yesterday that he had targeted
Mr Welsby as it had become clear from correspondence with ScotRail's
director, Mr John Ellis, that a decision over the future of the service
lay with the BR board and not ScotRail.
Mr McPherson has already issued an ultimatum that, unless the normal
booking service is restored, the council will take further court action.
In a letter faxed to Mr Welsby yesterday, he said: ''I was bitterly
disappointed to learn from Mr Ellis that he could not guarantee bookings
on this service beyond June 30.
''The significance of this date escapes me, since any appeal to the
House of Lords cannot possibly be heard by then.''
The BR board is meeting in London this Friday and is expected to
discuss the future of the sleeper service and whether there is to be an
appeal to the House of Lords over the decision at the Court of Session
that the service should continue pending public consultation.
Mr Ellis is due to visit Fort William today to hear comments from the
public. He said yesterday: ''There has been a lot of focus on the West
Highland Line because of the Fort William sleeper issue. ScotRail's
remit extends much wider than this, however, and we hope to get a
constructive overview of all our operations in the West Highlands.
''We have spent more than #100,000 promoting the West Highland Line
since last October and we are seeing some very positive results. Numbers
of Highland Railcard holders have soared from around 1300 to 25,000, and
customer numbers have leapt by 50% from 12,000 to 18,000 on average over
the past few months.''
The Scottish Trades Union Congress said yesterday that BR board
members should be made to pay personally the cost of any appeal to the
Lords on the sleeper issue.
A spokesman for Highlands and Islands Enterprise said: ''The main
thing we are working on just now is the report (commissioned by HIE from
consultants at a cost of #30,000) which will detail the economic impact
of any cuts to the existing rail network in the Highlands.''
* Intercity East Coast yesterday launched an early-morning, high-speed
service to woo business travellers from the skies to the rails. The
Scottish Pullman Service leaves Edinburgh at 6am and arrives in London
less than four-and-a-quarter hours later.

THE technical manager of His Majesty's Theatre in Aberdeen has been
cleared of an allegation of bullying, but has resigned from his post.
Mr Jon Kerr, 31, was suspended on full pay in April. The Broadcasting,
Entertainment, Cinematograph, and Theatre Union (Bectu) had prepared a
document listing 12 alleged incidents of bullying on behalf of its 20
members who work in the theatre.
However, Mr Kerr was cleared of these allegations after an
investigation which found no substance to them.
Almost immediately there was a further allegation and Mr Kerr was
suspended.
This week Mr Kerr was represented at a hearing into the allegation by
Bectu national officer Mr Gerry Morrissey. Another Bectu officer
represented the staff member who made the allegation.
Yesterday Mr Morrissey, who said he had never met Mr Kerr until the
hearing, said that the allegation was found to be unsubstantiated and
the charges were withdrawn and the suspension lifted.
''However after the hearing was completed Jon (Mr Kerr) indicated he
did not feel he could carry on working and his resignation, with
immediate effect, was mutually agreed,'' he said.
Theatre director Mr Robert Robson said that Mr Kerr, who started work
in Aberdeen four years ago following a similar post with the Globe
Theatre in Belfast, had chosen to resign.
''It was in his mind this was in the best interests of himself and the
theatre,'' said Mr Robson.

THE UK director of Greenpeace, Lord Melchett, has been ordered to
appear before a Scottish judge tomorrow in the latest legal move in the
continuing saga of the sinking of the Brent Spar.
Lord Melchett will be asked to reveal the identities of Greenpeace
activists who are threatening to disrupt the dumping of the disused oil
platform in the Atlantic.
Mr Jonathan Castle, the captain of the Greenpeace ship Altair, which
is shadowing the 65,000-tonne installation as it is towed to its watery
grave at one mile per hour, has also been ordered to appear at the Court
of Session tomorrow.
Mr Castle took part in an occupation of the Brent Spar, which began in
April this year as a protest against Shell UK's plans to dispose of the
platform at sea rather than bring it ashore for destruction.
Shell has been granted a Government licence to dump the installation
in the Atlantic, and claims that disposing of it on land would be four
times as expensive.
Mr Castle will be asked to explain his failure to obey an earlier
order by Lord Johnston at the Court of Session, requiring him to tell
Shell the identities of activists who took part in the occupation of the
Brent Spar.
He has also been ordered to explain his intentions and to give
undertakings which the court may require over reports that Greenpeace is
planning to use the Altair to interfere with the Brent Spar's progress.
The new legal moves emerged yesterday as Shell, which has already
resorted to the courts several times since the occupation of the Brent
Spar, returned to the Court of Session.
If Shell succeeds in identifying those taking part in the protest, it
is expected to seek further court orders restraining them from further
disrupting the dumping operation.
Mr Gerard Moynihan, counsel for Shell, told Lord Johnston that the
convoy towing the Brent Spar should be in place for it to be sunk by the
middle of next week, but there were continuing fears that attempts would
be made to disrupt the plan.
Mr Moynihan added: ''I am advised that there is a danger to life as a
result. What is necessary in order to stop that is to get complete
disclosure of the branches of Greenpeace and the representatives who are
involved in this activity.''
He asked that Lord Melchett, the director of Greenpeace Ltd, be
summoned before the court to supply information about the continuing
protest.
As far as Mr Castle was concerned, Shell's information was that he was
about 12 hours' sailing time from Lerwick, and could not reach Edinburgh
for a court hearing until late tomorrow.
Mr Jonathan Mitchell, QC, for Greenpeace, asked the court for further
time to obtain up-to-date instructions from his clients.
Lord Johnston said he understood the motives of Greenpeace, but it
seemed to be taking part in the disruption of a commercial organisation
going about its lawful business.
He granted orders for Mr Castle and Lord Melchett, or another
authorised representative of Greenpeace UK, to appear before him.

TWO brothers from Ayrshire, who made multiple share applications
during the electricity privatisation in 1993, were each fined #1500 at
Kilmarnock Sheriff Court yesterday.
Last month, when they appeared in separate cases, Peter Gilmour, 39, a
plater, of Whitecraig Road, Ardrossan, and James Gilmour, 53, an oil rig
worker, of Mayfield Road, Saltcoats, admitted using false names to buy
more than the permitted number of shares.
The court was told the frauds were similar and that James Gilmour had
used his brother's bank account to operate his scheme.
Defence solicitor Alan Kerr said that, when ScottishPower was
privitised, Peter Gilmour, attracted by some success with an earlier
share venture, decided that further profits could be made.
Initially, a number of workmates were interested in joining the
investment project but, when they backed out, Peter Gilmour decided to
go it alone, and borrowed #3000 as a bank overdraft to fund his scheme.
Despite well publicised warnings against the practice, he sought to
maximise his investment and bypass restrictions on share allocation by
submitting multiple applications using the names of his friends and
workmates to secure 7000 shares in ScottishPower plc.
Later, a special fraud unit was set up by police in Edinburgh and
Peter Gilmour's casewas investigated in 1993, and signatures and
handwriting on his bogus applications were found to be the same.
The court was also told that James Gilmour obtained a total of 6000
shares in ScottishPower plc and Hydro Electric plc in the same
fraudulent manner.

TWO Government watchdog groups yesterday issued a damning indictment
of Dounreay's management and storage of 20 years' worth of nuclear waste
in a 200ft shaft.
The groups have called for urgent action over the shaft which is
likely to lead to the retrieval and removal of the waste.
The report was described last night by a leading anti-nuclear
campaigner as ''the most damning report ever published on any part of
the British nuclear industry''.
Dounreay's director admitted that it would take more than 10 years and
up to #200m to rectify.
The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment
(Comare) and the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee had
been asked to investigate the discovery of more than 100 radioactive
metallic particles on the foreshore around Dounreay within a 12-year
period.
They believe that untidy disposal of waste down the shaft and an
explosion in it in 1977 probably spread the particles on to the ground
around the shaft, and that they have been moving on to the shore ever
since as a result of erosion.
The report points to the explosion having been caused by a minimum of
two kilogrammes of sodium and potassium being dumped in the shaft and
reacting with water.
RWMAC's chairman Sir John Nill said yesterday: ''Any schoolchild knows
that when you put these chemicals in water, they generate hydrogen and
there is a severe risk of an explosion.''
The report says the shaft is likely to be breached by natural erosion
within the next 100 years. However, it recognises new management
structures have been introduced.
It adds: ''However, the membership of the Dounreay Safety and
Environmental Steering Group which is dealing with this action is
largely internal and does not have the scientific expertise to address
all the issues which have been posed.''
Comare, meanwhile, was clearly stunned to find that Dounreay's
estimates of radioactivity accidentally released were a fraction of the
true levels. It is now concerned that this might undermine the authority
of its second report which served to allay fears that Dounreay was
linked to childhood leukemia.
It pointed out: '' . . . one particle found on the Dounreay foreshore
had a comparable level of radioactivity equivalent to the estimate of
the size of the entire accidental release provided by the UKAEA and used
as the basis for the conclusions in its second report''.
The report demands that no other information about releases is
withheld. It concludes, however, that it is unlikely that this
contamination accounts for the still unexplained incidence of childhood
leukemia around the plant.
These particular particles could not be the leukemia source because
anyone coming into contact with them would become so ill as to be
hospitalised within a few days.
Anti-nuclear campaigner Mrs Lorraine Mann, claimed the report was a
damning indictment of Dounreay. She added that it gave evidence of the
plant not having told the truth to organisations which had been
investigating the ''leukemia clusters''.
Mr John Baxter, the director of Dounreay, said last night that it had
never been Dounreay's purpose to mislead anyone over the levels of of
radioactive contamination from the shaft.
''I have tracked back and I have not found any intention to mislead
Comare,'' he said.
The report concludes that progressive steps should be taken quickly to
'' . . . fully evaluate the situation and propose a solution and a
timetable for the treatment of the waste in accord with modern
standards.
''This is likely to require the retrieval of the waste and its
repackaging for disposal elsewhere, to be followed by the
decontamination of the shaft, and its de-authorisation for disposal. The
RWMAC has been advised that the UKAEA will be undertaking a review of
options for the shaft.''
Dr Derek Pooley, chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority's
Government Division, which is responsible for Dounreay, said his
organisation accepted the report.

TWO school pupils who were seriously injured when they were sprayed
with flaming petrol in a school hall told a court yesterday how they
thought they were going to die.
Darren Crawford, 18, and Stephen Crossland were among 31 pupils
sitting A-level exams in the school hall at Sullivan Upper School in
Holywood, County Down, when the attack happened on June 17 last year.
They were giving evidence at Antrim Crown Court in the trial of former
pupil, Mr Garnet Bell, 46, of Inverary Avenue, Belfast, who has denied
attempting to murder three boys, grievous bodily harm, and arson,
although his lawyers have admitted formally that he wielded the
flame-thrower made from a fire extinguisher.
Darren Crawford told the court that, as he attempted to leave the
hall: ''My legs were caught in the chair. I thought that was it, I was
going to die.''
Stephen Crossland said he saw the attacker pull out a lighter when he
entered the hall: ''He tried to flick it once or twice, then I was
covered in a ball of flame. I thought he was trying to kill me. I could
hardly breathe. I thought I was dying.
''I heard lots of people screaming -- severe panic. I think I was
screaming myself. I think they were shouting 'Madman'.''
Both victims, who were visibly scarred and wore protective gloves in
court, said they had run from the hall to toilets where they had been
doused with water.
Darren Crawford said he saw Stephen Crossland when he arrived in the
toilet. ''He was blackened. The skin on his face -- it looked like it
had melted. My hands were blacked and melted as well.''
They described the pain as ''excruciating'' and ''unbelievable''. Both
have received skin grafts and will require further surgery.
A third pupil who was also seriously injured is expected to give
evidence later this week. A further three students suffered minor
injuries.
The jury of 11 men and one woman have been asked to decide upon Bell's
intent in carrying out the attack, after defence lawyer Anthony
Cinnamond, QC, accepted that Bell had wielded the flame-thrower.
Bell, who was ejected from the dock yesterday after two outbursts in
court, apologised to the judge, the Lord Chief Justice for Northern
Ireland, Sir Brian Hutton, for his ''excessive behaviour''.
A teacher at the school told the court that she found Darren Crawford
in the grounds outside the examination hall after the fire alarm went
off.
''He was actually black from head to foot,'' said Ms Maureen Lynas, a
computer studies teacher.
''The clothes were burnt completely to him and the skin was actually
starting to come off.''
The trial continues.

THE head of a nursing home company in Ayrshire has expressed his
dismay at the apparent lack of a tendering process for the controversial
90-bed psychogeriatric unit to be built at Irvine.
The local MP and trade union leaders have already attacked the
decision by Ayrshire and Arran Health Board to award the contract to
Irvine Care, which is part of a US-based multi-national health care
organisation.
Now, it has emerged that local companies were not informed of the
contract, and that there was no communication from the health board
about the impending tie-up with Irvine Care.
Mr Joe Campbell, managing director of Westsound, which operates three
nursing homes in Ayrshire and one in Glasgow, said that the award to the
American-owned company had come as ''a bolt from the blue''.
Last month, a 15-year contract for a unit to be built at Irvine,
caring initially for 90 patients and worth #1.6m in the first year, was
signed by the health board and hailed as ''the best solution for
patients and carers''.
Yesterday, the general manager of Ayrshire and Arran Health Board, Mr
Jim Eckford, said: ''The consultation process began in 1992, and has
continued since then. I am surprised that there is anyone disappointed
at the process, which has at all times been open and above board.
''The bid from Irvine Care was considered by the health board to be
the best solution.''
Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, said: ''This once again
illustrates that all is not well with this contract to Irvine Care. It
really consolidates my worst fears, that the whole thing is clearly
Government-driven, and that due care is not being taken of the proper
tendering procedures.''
0   Meanwhile, the Labour MP for Leith, Mr Malcolm Chisholm, last
night voiced his concern over a private company's bid for an NHS
hospital contract for a 60-bed nursing home for the elderly in
Edinburgh, writes Rob Robertson.
Mr Chisholm, who said he was worried about the bid from Westminster
Health Care, has written to Lothian Health Board chairman, Dr John
Baynham, claiming an American-based firm -- which is the main
shareholder in the company -- had been investigated for alleged medical
fraud and abuse in the USA a number of years ago.
The company at the centre of the allegations, National Medical
Enterprises Incorporated, has non-executive directors on the Westminster
board.
The controversy is the latest to hit plans by the health board to deal
with tenders for nursing homes. Lothian Health Council has claimed the
board announced a contract for a 60-bed home on Monday, without proper
consultation.
Mr Robert Stevenson, secretary of LHC said: ''What's the point of
asking people for their views if, behind the scenes, you are awarding
contracts?''
A spokesman for Westminster said last night it was a major public
company with a good reputation throughout Britain.
A Lothian health spokesman said there had been tenders for a sixty-bed
nursing home for north-east Edinburgh from both the NHS and other
organisations.
He added it was still to be decided to whom the contract should be
awarded.

IT may be only rock'n'roll but the prospect of a free concert in
Glasgow by one of America's biggest bands threw the city into chaos
yesterday.
Ahead of the pack, our sister paper, the Evening Times, announced that
Bon Jovi would play the concert today in George Square to make up for
not playing any Scottish dates on their current tour.
No sooner had the news rolled off the presses than Glasgow District
Council and the police pulled the plug on the story and the promoters --
leaving the great rock'n'roll mystery of if and where the band would
perform.
A council spokesman said the promoters, Midland Concert Promotions,
had approached them at 2pm for permission to play in the city centre --
after the story was page one news.
The spokesman said George Square was out because of the implications
for traffic and public safety. The city centre had been ruled out for
similar reasons.
The police sang the same song. A spokesman said: ''The problem is that
we only learned of this through the press. We feel that it is unsafe to
set it up at such short notice in the city centre without adequate
precautions.''
This, however, was not music to the ears of the promoters. A spokesman
for MCP said the band, who wanted to promote their new album by doing
three impromptu concerts on the same day -- in Glasgow, Cardiff, and
London -- would perform somewhere in Glasgow.
He said: ''I'm not telling anyone where it is. I can't tell you
because the police will stop us from doing it. Life's a bitch.''
However, with the police and council in the dark and the promoters not
wanting to shed any light on their predicament, the band's record
company, Mercury Records, told The Herald the group would be playing at
Tower Records in Argyle Street at 12.30pm.
A spokesman for the store said it was 99% certain that the live
concert would go ahead.

CABINET Minister Jonathan Aitken was at the centre of a new row last
night over his links to an arms company which is to face a Customs and
Excise inquiry for alleged sanctions-busting sales to Iran.
Mr Aitken was ordered by the Prime Minister on Monday to cancel a
visit to Northern Ireland to ensure he was present in the Commons to
hear a statement by Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of
Trade, who briefed Mr Major on the contents after last week's Cabinet.
Mr Michael Heseltine, in an extraordinary statement, said papers about
the activities of the Grantham-based BMARC company had been passed to
Customs and Excise.
Mr Aitken, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, was a non-executive
director of the company for 19 months, before becoming a Minister, at
the time when one of the alleged illegal deals took place.
Mr Heseltine told MPs that naval guns made by the firm, which were
supposedly being exported to Singapore, ''could well'' have been going
to the Tehran regime.
Customs and Excise are to investigate whether BMARC may have breached
the Government arms embargo by sending weapons and equipment to Iran, in
a shipment known as Project Lisi.
Labour industry spokesman Brian Wilson last night called for Mr
Aitken's resignation.
He said that, with a further inquiry by the Commons Select Committee
on Trade and Industry into the affair pending, and fellow former
directors of BMARC saying that Mr Aitken would have had to be ''blind
and deaf'' not to know about the shipments, the Minister was now ''on
the wrong side of the credibility threshold''.
Mr Aitken at once repeated his insistence, first made to the Commons
in March, that he had no knowledge of the shipment and said he would
look forward to giving evidence to the Select Committee.
He repeated that ''I was never given any indication or information
which could suggest that a BMARC contract with Singapore might result in
onward shipments of components to Iran.
''Seven years after the event, I have no recollection of ever having
heard about Project Lisi or read about it in company reports.''
Mr Aitken issued a further statement saying a Customs and Excise
investigation did not alter his own position.
The Commons statement by Mr Heseltine stunned MPs with its revelation
of the licensing system's failure to operate the embargo properly.
He said a spot check of licence applications revealed that, between
1986 and 1989, 74% of forms had not supplied full information about the
nature of the items being exported or where they would finally end up.
By comparison, BMARC had submitted incomplete documentation on only
36% of its applications for a licence.
Mr Heseltine disclosed that, although intelligence reports indicated
that naval guns, stated to be for Singapore, had been sold on to Iran by
Oerlikon, BMARC's Swiss parent company, the DTI ''failed to make the
connection'' between them and an export licence application by BMARC for
the export of ''two similar guns and ammunition''.
Interviewed on Channel Four News, he said he regarded the affair as
''a cock up'' rather than involving any conspiracy by Ministers to evade
their own regulatory system.
The department had simply been swamped by the number of export licence
applications, which in the late 80s were at one time running at 2500 a
year per official, compared with the present rate of 400.
Repeating his Commons reference to BMARC, he said there did seem to be
evidence of one company ''circumnavigating'' the licensing regime.
However, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Heseltine
appeared deeply reluctant to back his Cabinet colleague.
Pressed three times on whether he accepted Mr Aitken's assurance, he
said only: ''Jonathan is a friend and a colleague of mine and if he
makes a statement to the House of Commons I believe what he said.''
Former board members of the company last night defended their role in
the firm's arms sales.
Mr Gerald James, former BMARC chairman who watched the statement on
TV, interpreted Mr Heseltine's statement as the President of the Board
of Trade ''putting himself forward as a good boy''.
Dr Jack Cunningham, Labour's trade spokesman, described the operation
of the embargo system as ''a fiasco of negligence and incompetence''.
Mr Aitken sat by the Prime Minister's side on the Treasury bench as Mr
Heseltine made the statement and heard Dr Cunningham deride the policy
statement made by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the then Foreign Secretary, that
the arms embargo would be monitored ''rigorously''.
Downing Street last night moved swiftly to deny suggestions that Mr
Aitken's position was in jeopardy.
The timing and fullness of yesterday's statement are likely to raise
questions about the motivation of Mr Heseltine.
He deliberately distanced himself from other Ministers in his evidence
to the Scott Inquiry -- and may be the one Cabinet member to emerge from
the final report with his reputation enhanced.

<HEADLINE>Watchdog worried by threat to free banking</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S leading consumer watchdog is worried about the trend
towards the ending of free banking, and claimed it could have a
discriminatory effect on people on low incomes.
''More and more the banks are not tremendously keen on the odd wee
pensioner lady with about #50 in her account,'' Mrs Lynne MacMillan, the
Scottish Consumer Council's legal adviser said in Edinburgh.
''Such a move has the potential for people at the lower end of the
market being 'unbanked'. Banks have some social responsibility for
helping customers in that position,'' she told senior legal figures.
Speaking at the International Bar Association conference in a debate
on the relations between banks and clients and client protection, she
said that free banking was very important, given the difficulties people
faced in getting any form of credit without a bank account.
She told the meeting that she believed Scotland had a good banking
industry, but bank charges had risen greatly in recent years because of
commercial pressures.
She said she knew of incidents where banks had closed customers'
accounts without telling them because they were at a low level. ''They
declare them obsolete and that's pretty upsetting.''
Mrs MacMillan said: ''I believe the pressure is going to be upwards in
terms of what you have to have in your account to maintain free banking
as a privilege. Really, there is no such thing as free banking. You pay
in other ways.''
She said that the SCC very much welcomed the appointment of the
Banking Ombudsman. ''I don't think courts are the best place for
resolving disputes of individual customers.''
She said voluntary regulation of the industry was not enough.
''Self-regulation and statutory regulation are necessary.''
Mr Derek Arnott, Chief Legal Officer for the Royal Bank of Scotland,
who was involved in the drawing up of a code of banking practice due to
be reviewed in two years' time, said he suspected there would be
dramatic changes in the way banks delivered services.
Deputy Banking Ombudsman Mr Christopher Eadie tolddelegates that the
post was not ''a consumer champion''.
''We try to be right down the middle and are absolutely impartial,''
Mr Eadie said.
* The work of a committee set up by the Government last year to
investigate current procedures surrounding alleged miscarriages of
justice in Scotland is to be monitored by leading international legal
figures, the conference was told.
The IBA committee wants to draw up a set of minimum standards
worldwide to guarantee certain actions are available to be taken to
review cases in which a suggestion or evidence of a miscarriage of
justice existed.
