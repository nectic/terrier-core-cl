No, your eyes are not deceiving you, Terry Butcher did play for
Rangers last night at Kilbowie Park, and he was not the only former
Ibrox star who turned out against Clydebank Reserves.
The problem was that Rangers were hit by a spot of bother as regards
injuries and Butcher, Ally Dawson, Bobby Russell, Gordon Smith, John
MacDonald, and coach Davie Dodds, again pulled on a jersey for the
cause.
But the night didn't end on a high for the men in light blue, with the
Bankies winning the match 1-0, although the home side's David Hardie
seems to come off second best in this tussle with Butcher.

<HEADLINE>Specialists win equality over principals' pay</HEADLINE>

NINE women specialist teachers have won their fight to prove they
should be paid the same as men in principal teachers' posts with
Strathclyde Regional Council, as their duties were of equal value.
They are among more than 100 teachers who are presently fighting
claims for higher pay from Strathclyde region as they have taken on
extra duties, making their work of equal value to principal teachers'
posts.
A Glasgow industrial tribunal ruled the work of the nine women was of
equal value and continued the case on compensation if a financial
settlement cannot be reached.
The difference in salary is up to #5000 a year for periods of up to
two years.
The tribunal heard earlier that the nine had specialist skills but
there was no provision for principal teachers in their particular
subjects partly due to financial constraints.
Falling school rolls and changing demands for subjects also meant
their particular skills had to earn enough points before a new principal
post could be created. Post holders in departments facing falling demand
also had their seniority preserved until retiral.
The nine were: Miss Seonaid MacRae, a computing teacher of Cathkin
High School, Glasgow; Miss Linda Hall, a computing teacher at Trinity
High School, Renfrew; Miss Margaret Taggart, a computing teacher at St
Margaret's School, Airdrie; Mrs Margaret Milton, former assistant
principal of music at St Thomas Aquinas Secondary School, Glasgow; Miss
Eileen Miller, modern studies teacher at Thomas Muir High School,
Bishopbriggs; Mrs Linda Park, formerly a computing teacher at Lanark
Grammar School; and Mrs Anne Black, a learning support teacher, Mrs
Kathleen Wallace, a religious education teacher, and Miss Shona Miller,
a computing teacher, all at Vale of Leven Academy.
The region's education department agreed that unpromoted teachers
could not be asked to do the work of principal teachers and it would be
wrong for a headteacher to require them to do so.
Headteachers were themselves in a difficult position. Work at promoted
level had to be done if pupils were to be taught effectively, resources
ordered, and pupils presented for exams.
Heads had a choice of allowing the current situation to continue
knowing they had ''volunteers'' who would not wish to let pupils lose
out, or facing up to what would be a difficult alternative, requiring
principal teachers not particularly stretched in their own subject
taking on principal teacher duties in another area.
The tribunal heard that the education department had an annual budget
of #1000m but claims would total no more than #100,000 based on each
averaging #5000 a year for a two year period.

MEGA-GRUMP Sir Bernard Ingham should be proud of them. The boys and
girls he left behind, toiling in the Whitehall truth machine, did a
grand job for the Government this week on nuclear power. The message for
Scottish consumption was neatly tailored around Ian Lang's reported
negotiating triumph. With not a single ace up his sleeve, our languid,
unblinking Scottish Secretary saw off the stronger hands held by
''Hearts'' Heseltine and ''Clubs'' Collier of Nuclear Electric, to scoop
the pool.
Scottish Nuclear survives as a distinct arm of the new, merged, and
soon-to-be-privatised AGR and PWR generator. Scotland gets the group
headquarters. The combined board is to be chaired by someone with strong
Scottish connections.
Key engineering jobs are to be relocated from England. And the
international arm of the new company -- the arm which has one more
chance to persuade the Taiwanese that the Westinghouse/NE bid is the
right one to build a new PWR for the offshore Chinese -- is to come here
too.
Three inward investments for Scotland. Up to 125 additional jobs. A
veritable forest of golden shares, letters of intent and other corporate
handcuffs to make the deal stick. And not one Lang hair out of place. If
there's ever another remake of Maverick, Mel Gibson will face some stiff
competition for the lead.
The nuclear message dispensed by Bernard's babes south of the Border
on Tuesday was quite different. But every bit as successful. No need to
woo sceptical Scots there. Instead the mission was twin-pronged. To make
sure the impact of the early ending of the nuclear levy -- #20 off the
average annual electricity bill -- got through to everyone.
But, at the same time, to prove that the unseemly dash to flog off
bits of Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric by next summer owes
nothing to base electoral considerations and everything to a high-minded
determination to advance the impact of market forces throughout the
energy sector.
That part of the message was couched in deceptively simple terms. Yes,
we hope to raise some #3000m from this sale. But #2600m of it will be
needed to bridge the remaining gap in the decommissioning costs of the
ageing Magnox stations, which are deemed unsellable and are to stay in
state hands. It is costing us real money to end the nuclear levy early.
So forget tax cuts. There won't be any money from this sale to pay for
them.
The Financial Times bought it. The Telegraph bought it. On their front
pages on Wednesday they dutifully headlined the news that the ''N-sale
plan hits tax cut hopes'' and that ''Nuclear sale shortfall hits tax
cuts''. The FT even had a Treasury official claiming, ''If you look at
the sums and look at the cost of scrapping the nuclear levy -- which is
significant -- then the proceeds you are going to get from selling
nuclear power will not allow you to make tax cuts.'' Yes, Hebden
Bridge's finest should be proud of that Treasury source and all the
others who laboured long and hard this week to ensure truth would out.
It's eyewash, of course. That #2600m calculation of the shortfall on
Magnox liabilities came on a single sheet of paper from the Department
of Trade and Industry, accompanied by a second sheet of notes. Total
liabilities for all SN and NE's Magnoxes and the two companies'
liabilities for the decommissioning of some British Nuclear Fuel plants
are put at #8500m. But that's #1300m less than the liabilities reported
in the two companies' own annual reports.
Don't worry, says the DTI, we have assumed the companies can earn more
than 2% a year (the conventional discount rate used in the company
calculations) on their cash balances in the years ahead. Hence the lower
liabilities.
But that's just the start of the number fiddling. The DTI has also
assumed that 10% can be knocked off the eventual cost of
decommissioning. That's a further saving of #900,000. Then it has saved
a further #500,000 by assuming that the so-called safestore
decommissioning strategy will be used on the Magnoxes.
But safestore, as the White Paper points out, means that, after fuel
is removed from a Magnox immediately after shutdown, nothing more will
be done, other than keeping the site safe, for another 35 years. The
previous plan was to demolish buildings outwith the nuclear core within
five to 10 years. Under either strategy the core would not be demolished
for 100 years.
The implication is simple. The bulk of the decommissioning costs will
not have to be met for at least 35 years or, more likely, 100 years.
Although the Government seems determined to foist a segregated
decommissioning fund on the bits of the business poised for
privatisation, it sees ''no practical benefit'' from a segregated fund
for those parts which remain publicly owned. So there's no question of
the bulk of the sale proceeds next year being paid into some separate
Magnox decommissioning fund to meet liabilities up to 100 years hence.
Having helped create the decommissioning shortfall by their decision
to end the nuclear levy and Scottish subsidy arrangements early -- as
The Herald was the first to point out on April 27, Ministers (and their
mouthpieces) are fibbing when they suggest the nuclear sale proceeds
have nothing to do with tax cuts.
If -- and it's a big if -- this sale makes it to the starting blocks,
the only short-term impact the proceeds (say #3000m from the sale and a
further #2000m in cash currently held by Nuclear Electric for Magnox
decommissioning, which will be transferred to Government coffers) will
have is to ameliorate the public sector borrowing requirement and pave
the way for the tax cuts Chancellor Kenneth Clarke promised the Scottish
Tories this week.
That ''if'' is multi-faceted. Having digested Tuesday's announcement
and the accompanying White Paper, I am no more convinced than I was at
the time that the cumbersome creature created by this merger will prove
appealing to those elements of the City who do not stand to earn fees
from the process.
The White Paper has effectively ruled out any new nuclear power
station building in the UK until 2020 at the earliest. There will be no
public subsidy. If the privatised company and its capital backers want
to proceed, says the White Paper, the Government would encourage them to
do so. But the same White Paper insists gas-fired plant is more
cost-effective. And it concludes: ''Private finance for a new nuclear
power station is unlikely to be forthcoming in current conditions.''
So the Government is trying to sell an industry with little hope of
expanding its core business in the next two decades. And it is proposing
to sell it in a form which, thanks to the necessary political fix to
placate Scottish opinion, looks cost rich. That seems to me to be an
unsustainable proposition.
If it does manage to sell it, at a significant discount to reflect all
these attendant risks no doubt, let me predict that it won't be long
before the group board, wherever it happens to be located, is back at
the holders of the golden shares asking for dispensations to cut this
and rationalise that.
By that time the tax bribes will have been made. The election will
have been won and lost. And the Magnox decommissioning costs will still
loom for generations of taxpayers to come. That's politics.

Sensational stories about child molesters cause unnecessary alarm
among parents, reports Sarah Nelson
THE collapse of a high-profile ''bogus health visitor'' case in
Lothian holds salutary, embarrassing lessons -- especially for some
media and ''expert'' professional pundits.
Police have said, tersely, that ''all inquiries and investigations are
at an end'' in the case of Lynne Stewart, who claimed a woman had tried
to snatch her baby Erin from the doorstep.
They have sent a report to the procurator fiscal about wasting police
time, though the mother denies having invented the whole story. The
alarmist hype that surrounded the case, with photofit pictures of the
abductor flashed nationwide, is an extreme example of the wild, unlikely
speculation surrounding the whole ''bogus social worker'' phenomenon.
One newspaper had even brought Mrs Stewart together with another
mother, whose children were briefly abducted then returned safely.
This was for a sensational article which inflamed parents' anxieties
across Scotland. It was full of hysterical language about evil perverts,
warped monsters and ''Scotland's most twisted couple''.
One criminologist, Bill Thompson, claims similarities between the
bogus callers -- who have rarely, if ever, harmed a child -- and ''the
behaviour pattern of a serial killer, who roams the country preying on
victims''.
Other sensational stories have speculated about paedophile rings,
despite not a shred of evidence that such rings are behind bogus visits
anywhere. But the stories persist because they make good, racy, prurient
copy. Careful, balanced information, rooted in actual knowledge of child
abuse, does not.
Some highly dangerous strangers do snatch children (almost always
outside the home) to molest or even kill them. But the sad truth is
child abusers have numerous easier chances to prey on victims, as
trusted relatives, baby-sitters or carers in many professions.
Sadly, they have been far more successful than any ''bogus social
worker''. The real problem lies in persuading public and professions to
accept and guard against the daily risk from trusted adults.
The public have been asked to swallow ludicrous images -- even by
''experts'' who should know better. Smart, middle-aged, blue-rinsed
matrons roaming housing estates for the chance of molesting a toddler;
mixed-sex paedophile couples going about their evil work in public;
people trying to snatch children to ''groom'' them for paedophile
practices.
Psychologists have hedged their bets to absurd degrees. The fictional
''Lothian Snatcher'', one said recently, seemed both desperate and cool,
naive and sophisticated.
Again, mothers and children in Strathclyde have been named and
photographed with confidential details given of social work involvement
with their families. The social work department didn't give this
information to newspapers: who did, and will the publicity place already
vulnerable people at more risk?
Child protection staff find it especially galling when they read
ignorant, sensational media speculation, because some reports have
hordes of sex perverts roaming doorsteps one day then next day the
social workers are denounced for grossly exaggerating the prevalence of
child sexual abuse.
Little wonder child protection workers often feel totally confused at
how journalists -- and some professional pundits -- have failed to work
out any logical thoughts about children at risk or done any intelligent
homework.
Since no bogus social worker has yet been caught, and we know almost
nothing of their motives, fanciful public speculation seems pointless.
It is the job of the police and other investigators to pursue carefully
any clues.

Each time the code is breached the ability of newspapers to perform
their vital function will be weakened
Lord Wakeham
If a privacy law is to be avoided, self-regulation by the newspaper
industry has to be seen to be working. Margaret Vaughan reports on the
task facing Lord Wakeham
THERE is a certain class of people who simply don't know how to
behave. They are rude, intrusive, disrespectful, and deeply
untrustworthy. They are rats. They are finks. They are journalists.
So runs the argument for laws to hobble the investigative activities
of newspapers. You may hear it brayed loudest in the shadier corners of
the corridors of power. Perhaps from those with most to hide, who uphold
the noble principle that being found out is the only sin. More often, in
a climate of governmental decay, not unlike this one, it is used as a
political club with which to keep the impudent intruders at bay.
Counter to the argument for legislation to curb the wilder whoops and
scoops of those who sup in what David Mellor, a not disinterested
observer, called the Last Chance Saloon is the notion of the free press.
Sniffy broadsheet types make erudite noises about democracy's balancing
forces and the dangers of censorship in suppressing truth along with the
scuttlebutt.
Anyway, they yelp, it's not us, it's them -- the underpress -- that's
to blame. The credibility of this case took a denting, though, when
Jonathan Aitken, with a straight face, wielded his trusty sword and
shield against the respectable end of the trade.
Give a dog a bad name and all breeds, poodles and Rottweilers alike,
end up muzzled: that is the root problem for those who fear legislation.
The likelihood of some sort of privacy laws -- designed perhaps to
protect the common individual from the harassing attention of the press
but certainly more likely to protect powerful individuals and vested
interests from unwanted attention -- draws ever closer with every fresh
slavering expose of sex romps and sad-acts by political importunists.
Lord Wakeham, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, knows
it as well as most. As well he might. For the former leader of the House
of Lords, Chief Whip, ex-Cabinet Minister, and fixer-in-chief to the
Thatcher Government was given the role to see if he could fix it for the
press to stave off legislation which back benchers favour but Ministers
do not. If a privacy law is to be avoided, self-regulation by the
industry has to be seen to be working. When he took the reins of the
four-year-old commission four months ago, from the hapless Lord
McGregor, he said the task was to strengthen that self-regulation.
Last month Lord Wakeham signalled his intent to do more than nip at
the heels of those editors and proprietors who breach the industry's
code of conduct in a speech to the Scottish Press Fund. He warned that
the use of spurious public interest arguments and subterfuge to gain
information would not be tolerated. The public interest defence was the
industry's ''trusty shield against the blunderbuss of statutory
regulation'', he said borrowing perhaps from another:
''Each time the code is breached without clear defence, the ability of
newspapers to perform their vital function of guarding the genuine
public interest will be weakened and the credibility of the entire press
diminished,'' he warned.
It was, as suspected, a reference to two recent stories in the News of
the World: the report on the alleged treatment of Earl Spencer's wife
for an eating disorder and drink problem, and the story which led to the
resignation of a junior government member, Richard Spring, over
three-in-a-bed sex allegations, in what appeared to many to be a set-up
by the newspaper. The sting allegedly involved a woman wired for sound:
how else could a verbatim report of a dinner table conversation appear,
word for word, in the newspaper? Many wondered, most guessed.
Lord Wakeham's metaphorical slap on the wrist, delivered publicly
yesterday to News of the World proprietor Rupert Murdoch, led in turn to
his delivering the head of the editor, Piers Morgan, on a plate.
The article referred to ''secret therapy'' at a clinic and went into
''considerable detail'' about the Countess's problems. It showed
photographs of her walking in the grounds of the clinic.
The editor had argued that Earl Spencer was a public figure whose
privileges by birth made him open to a degree of public examination. It
didn't wash. The commission concluded that it took a ''particularly
serious view'' of the newspaper's failure to observe the code.
Mr Morgan said he took full responsibility for the decision to publish
the story and photographs. His proprietor said he had no hesitation in
making public his remonstration:
''This company will not tolerate its papers bringing into disrepute
the best practices of popular journalism which we seek to follow,'' he
added. Is that all right then? Does that help the paper's journalists
know at precisely what point to make their excuses and leave off
intruding?
Catching toffs, tarts, and upstart politicians in flagrante is the
pivotal role of the News of the World -- hence its trade monicker, the
News of the Screws -- in the Murdoch stable. There is presumably a major
justification for its rich diet of titillation and laddish
''it's-all-a-bit-of-a-laugh-like'' ethos. It sells.
The letter to Murdoch also indicated that the commission had
considered launching an investigation into precisely how the News of the
World obtained information for the Richard Spring story. It was foiled
when Mr Spring found that unlike the Duke of Wellington, who told a kiss
and teller to publish and be damned, courage was not the attractive
option. He declined to make a formal complaint.
Writing directly to a proprietor was something to be done only in
instances of ''severe or calculated'' breaches of the code, under an
agreement made with newspaper publishers, Lord Wakeham said.
The commission also held that The People had failed to advance a
sufficient public interest defence to justify intruding into the
Countess of Spencer's privacy by reporting on her treatment.
The somewhat thin excuse that the stricken woman had allegedly once
told a magazine diarist at a function that she suffered from eating
disorders was not held to be justifiable. Nor was the po-faced plea that
the Earl and Countess gave extensive interviews to Hello! magazine given
much of a hearing.
The setting up of the Code of Conduct was the industry's attempt to
answer a vexed question: what's the difference between the public
interest and the interested public? Pique at being exposed or
purse-mouthed excuses for stealing pictures of dead children off
mantelpieces can lead to varying attempts to find the definitive answer.
The precursor to the Press Complaints Commission was the Press
Council, a somewhat lackadaisical body whose attempts to keep the
industry in line were regarded with anything from mild scorn to
hysterical laughter by those who had reason to want press curbs. Lord
Wakeham himself described its hearings as places where everyone ''lied
like troopers''.
The commission, by contrast, aims to rein in those who walk on the
wilder shores of journalism before all are captured in the tight noose
of statutory legislation. Lord Wakeham is on probation. He must be seen
to take on the excesses of some sectors of the press and be resistant to
pressure from government.
It is a precarious position, as Lord McGregor, who resigned before his
term of office expired, learned to his personal cost. A series of
ill-judged pronouncements on alleged press intrusions on members of the
royal family which turned out to be no such thing, just stories placed
with the collusion of those involved, led to embarrassment for him and
further pressure for statutory curbs.
The legislation is there, waiting, on the sidelines. Ministers do not
want it: on a cynical view because they cannot afford to alienate their
supporters in the industry, or if you are charitable because they
genuinely favour freedom of the press.
That phrase, though resonant, has a distinctly rum ring about it when
you consider that the proprietor given a telling off yesterday owns 30%
of the British press the commission is attempting to save from itself.
In the Last Chance Saloon can those who sup control the company they
keep?
Last orders anyone?

BEALE Dobie, the leading market-maker in traded endowment policies
with more than 20% of the market, is expanding its operations by setting
up a Scottish office.
Beale Dobie Scotland, a new joint venture with Scottish financial
services company McKenna Gladstone Walker, will open for business at the
end of June.
At present, proportionately fewer policyholders in Scotland find their
way to the open market, a gap which Beale Dobie intends to fill. ''By
surrendering direct to their life office they lose out by an average of
#1000, our average premium over surrender value is 14% after all
expenses,'' said Christopher Dobie.
Acceptable policies should be with-profits, have a current surrender
value of more than #2000 and have been in force for at least a quarter
of their term. Contact 01621 851133 for free copies.

The figures were certainly not . . . of themselves a vindication of
the decision not to raise rates, which may have been right or wrong
EDDIE George, the Governor of the Bank of England, refused to confirm
market speculation that he privately disagreed with the Chancellor's
decision not to raise interest rates when he addressed a conference in
Aberdeen yesterday.
Asked whether he agreed with last week's decision by Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke not to raise rates, Mr George avoided replying directly.
Instead, he diplomatically told a questioner at the annual conference
of the British Chambers of Commerce that interest rates should be geared
towards the economy as a whole over a timespan of 18 months to two
years.
Mr George merely hinted at possible dissent with the Government by
declaring that the fall in inflation to 3.3% in April from 3.5% in March
should not be viewed as grounds for complacency.
The figures were ''certainly not . . . of themselves a vindication of
the decision not to raise rates, which may have been right or wrong,''
he said.
In Aberdeen, Mr George made a deliberate effort to stress his points
of convergence with the Government, praising it for ''a monetary policy
which is firmly directed sustaining the steady growth of output and
employment through the longer-term control of inflation''.
He said this had been very successful over the past few years and told
reporters that he believed the Chancellor remained ''very committed to
low inflation''.
But the main part of Mr George's speech was taken up with a defence of
free world markets, despite the punishment inflicted on the pound in
recent months and the damage wrought reckless trading in derivatives.
Mr George said the key to stable world markets was not more regulation
or Government intervention, but the adoption of prudent macro-economic
policies by individual governments.
''There is a broader international understanding on the approach to
economic management now than I can easily recall,'' he said, remarking
that the new democracies of eastern Europe and the emerging economies of
Asia and Latin America were all trying to limit public sector deficits,
cut levels of debt and maintain price stability.
''Market pressures rarely persist without some justification,'' Mr
George said. Attempts to constrain them through regulation or
intervention would be ''tantamount to shooting the messenger,'' he
added.
The Governor said the solution lay in ''each country individually
putting and keeping its own house in order''.
''Without that, collective intervention or policy co-ordination would
be unlikely to succeed,'' he added.

SCOTLAND'S legal watchdog warned yesterday that delays by the Law
Society in investigating complaints by clients against solicitors are
seriously undermining public confidence in the system.
In an unusually hard-hitting report, Mr Garry Watson, the Scottish
Legal Services Ombudsman, also expressed his belief that the names of
solicitors who are consistently guilty of shoddy work should be made
public and that the Law Society take steps to make this possible.
He is also seeking powers to recommend that the Law Society, the
governing body for Scotland's 7800 solicitors, should pay up to #1000
compensation to people who have suffered because their complaints have
been badly handled by the society.
Despite his criticisms, Mr Watson, who was appointed in July last
year, believes the legal profession should continue to regulate itself
as long as it demonstrates a commitment to effective and fair handling
of complaints by the public.
Commenting on the report, Mr Kenneth Pritchard, secretary of the Law
Society of Scotland, said: ''I think the report is fair and recognises
the efforts we have made.''
He said the Law Society had employed extra qualified and secretarial
staff to help deal with the problem of delays and added: ''I am
confident that problem has now been addressed and will not recur in
1995.''
The legal services ombudsman investigates the way in which the Law
Society and the Faculty of Advocates handle complaints by members of the
public.
Yesterday's report for the year 1994 is the first produced by Mr
Watson, a chartered accountant and former merchant banker. For the first
time, a copy of the report will be sent to every law firm in Scotland.
Last year, out of 1400 complaints dealt with by the Law Society, 300
were referred to the ombudsman. He issued 99 opinions, 31 of them
critical of the Law Society investigation.
At a news conference in Edinburgh yesterday, Mr Watson said delay by
the Law Society in dealing with complaints was the issue that had
concerned him most in his first six months in the job. It was a major
factor in aggravating clients.
Serious and unacceptable delays could arise in a number of areas when
the Law Society was investigating a complaint -- six-month delays for
interim reports in response to ombudsman's recommendations were not
unusual.
Mr Watson added: ''Delay is very upsetting for the client of a
solicitor with a complaint. I think a complainer is right to expect a
professional body to handle complaints effectively and professionally.
''If that doesn't happen, the complainer's confidence in the
commitment of the professional body to deal with the complaint takes a
dive.''
He added that the Law Society had acknowledged the existence and
unacceptability of delay and he had noticed a significant improvement in
the situation from the beginning of this year.
However, he said he found it unsatisfactory that there was no
mechanism, apart from the possibility of an ex-gratia payment, for a
complainer to be compensated for a badly-handled investigation.
''Unlike my opposite number in England, I have no authority to
recommend that the Law Society recognises such failings by making a
compensation payment . . .
''I have concluded that it is desirable that the ombudsman should have
a limited capacity to recommend the payment of compensation up to #1000
in such circumstances, and I am making an appropriate recommendation to
the Secretary of State for Scotland.''

CALEDONIAN Publishing, which owns The Herald and Evening Times, is
confident of increasing full-year operating profits by more than 20% in
spite of the 33% rise in newsprint prices which has just been announced.
Chief executive Liam Kane also used yesterday's announcement of the
company's interim results as a platform for a strong attack on Rupert
Murdoch's Scottish edition of The Times.
In the six months to end-March, Caledonian, the management buy-out
company which acquired The Herald and Evening Times from Lonrho three
years ago, increased operating profits by 37% to #4.7m. Turnover rose
only marginally to #29.2m.
With interest charges slightly higher, the improvement at the
operating level fed down to a 151% increase in pre-tax profits to #2.1m.
The cumulative effect of a 15% rise in newsprint prices earlier this
year and a further 33% hike from July 1 will be a #3.4m increase in
Caledonian's annual newsprint costs to #9.9m.
Mr Kane believed the results were a considerable achievement in the
face of continuing difficult trading conditions. He said: ''Not only has
the economy been extremely sluggish in the retail sector which our
newspapers rely on, but the cover price war has spread from the tabloids
and broadsheets to the mid-market.''
However, Mr Kane forecasts total operating profits of more than #10m
for the year to end-September, compared with #8.2m the previous year.
He expects the increase in newsprint prices to force the cessation of
at least some of the hostilities in the newspaper price war.
Mr Kane said: ''Sometime in the summer or early autumn, I would expect
to see some normality return to the market.
''However, I don't expect that to include Mr Murdoch, who continues to
sustain tens of millions of pounds of losses on The Times.''
Believing The Times to have short-changed readers north of the Border
on its coverage of the Scottish Nuclear story, Mr Kane added: ''It is a
loss-making English national title with a few token Scottish stories
included in its so-called Scottish edition.
''It certainly provides no service or any perception of Scottish
affairs for the average reader.''
Highlights of the six months, according to Mr Kane, included
improvements to The Herald and Evening Times, both under new editors,
and the contract to print the Scottish Daily Mail at Albion Street.
Caledonian Magazines, whose titles include Scottish Farmer, raised
interim trading profits by 73% to #401,000.

TEXTILES and clothing group Coats Viyella said yesterday that
first-quarter like-for-like sales were up 5%, but pre-tax profit growth
was ahead of the sales trend and the company anticipated an improved
result for the year as a whole.
Coats chariman Sir David Alliance told the annual general meeting that
the company had produced better results in emerging markets such as
Brazil and Turkey and trading was ''broadly in line with expectations''.
Economic liberalisation had boosted sales in India, but these had not
yet been matched by improved profitability, he added.
Sir David said a continuing rise in raw materials prices made it
difficult for Coats to maintain margins and the company faced ''tough
trading environments'' in the UK and United States, where profits were
likely to grow more slowly this year.

THE art auction market is continuing to show signs of recovery,
according to Sotheby's. ''Auction sales in the first quarter of 1995
increased by 9% with strong single-owner sales making the largest
contribution,'' said Diana Brooks, president and chief executive of New
York-based Sotheby's.
''We are encouraged by the level and quality of consignments which we
have received thus far in 1995.
''Our series of impressionist and modern art auctions held this week
brought the highest total since 1990, bringing $124.2m and exceeding the
low estimate of $104.4m.''
During the first three months of the year, the company suffered a net
loss of #4.5m.
Picasso's Angel Fernandez de Soto attracted keen competition from
several bidders and sold for $29.2m, the highest price for any painting
for five years.
Matisse's La Pose Hindoue set a record for the artist when it fetched
$14.9m.

A WATCHDOG group has warned that anglers could be facing a pollution
disaster.
Its fears arise from Government plans to replace river pollution
boards with a Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.
In the annual report of the Anglers' Clearwater Association, Chairman
Bill Currie states that many abandoned and heavily-contaminated sites
are lying like timebombs across the country.
He says closed coal workings present a particularly lethal threat to
streams and rivers as extremely toxic effluent is formed which can cause
serious contamination.
Mr Currie is concerned that the new body set to replace purification
boards within the year will not have the local machinery available to
deal with localised incidents in the urgent manner he says is frequently
required to ensure minimal damage.
Of particular concern to the group are disused mine workings --
particularly in Fife -- where there have recently been two serious
threats of pollution from former collieries near Kirkcaldy.

A FATHER has been found guilty of ''grotesquely cruel'' assaults on
his baby daughter.
The Edinburgh man, who cannot be identified, to protect the child's
identity, was convicted unanimously by a jury of two assaults after a
three-day trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He was found guilty of attacking the six-week-old baby in June 1993 by
pulling her arm and, the following September, of pulling and twisting
the infant's leg, in both cases to her severe injury.
He was also found guilty of failing to get proper medical care for the
girl after the second assault. The jury heard that the baby's arm was
broken in the first assault and she was left with a broken leg after the
second.
Sheriff Andrew Lothian said it was clear the man should not be allowed
anywhere near the baby again. He said he would refer the matter to the
Reporter to the Children's Panel.
He added: ''These were grotesquely cruel assaults on this baby.''
He deferred sentence on the 19-year-old for background reports until
June 1, and remanded him in custody.

THE Bank of England's latest quarterly report, which warned the
Government that it was in danger of missing its inflation target, has
left little room for doubt that the Governor, Eddie George, advised
Kenneth Clarke to raise interest rates last week.
The inescapable conclusion of the report is that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, who rejected the advice, and the Governor of the Bank are at
odds with one another over the central issue of economic policy. This
was underlined by the Bank's economic director, Mervyn King, at a news
conference.
''It's clear from our projection that in order to hit the (inflation)
target there will be a need for tighter monetary polcy and that will
have to be sooner rather than later,'' he said.
Though he avoided confirming the existence of a dispute over interest
rates, King also suggested the Bank did not see eye to eye with the
Chancellor on a number of issues.
He said he was unable to give any idea of how close UK interest rates
were to their peak in marked contrast to Clarke's view that the peak was
not far away.
King also argued that the first-quarter GDP figures, showing that the
economy grew at 0.8%, the same rate as in the final quarter of last
year, were more likely to be revised up than down. The Chancellor took
the unusual step last week of doubting the strength of the figures. He
specifically stated that the economy had slowed down despite them.
The Bank on the other hand is puzzled by the conflicting picture
painted by lacklustre monthly manufacturing output statistics and
buoyant survey and anecdotal evidence, notably from the CBI. King's
suspicion is that the manufacturing (and with them the GDP) figures will
have to be revised up.
There is no sign of the Bank backing down after the Chancellor's
refusal to raise rates. Indeed the strategy of the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street seems to be to force the Government's hand by
keeping up the pressure for a tightening of monetary policy.
The report concluded: ''Although the central projection for inflation
two years ahead has risen only modestly since the February report, that
revision is in the upwards direction, and the risks remain on the upside
as they were then.
''In these circumstances, although the projected rise in inflation
does not persist, it is particularly important that monetary policy does
not accommodate any second-round effects on wages and prices.''
The minutes of last week's controversial meeting are due to be
published in five weeks, but by then the Governor may well have gained
the upper hand and persuaded the Chancellor to raise rates at their next
meeting on June 7.
Not to do so would be to risk turning a dispute into a crisis. Both
men have stressed that they share the same objective on inflation. The
difference has been over the instrument to achieve it. The longer
remedial action is delayed the less likely is the chance that the
Government will get its inflation policy back on target.
The main change in the Bank's central projection for underlying (or
RPIX) inflation since the previous report is the increase in inflation
over the next year or so resulting from the lower exchange rate.
Between February 2 and May 4 sterling's trade-weighted index fell by
4.7%. It lost 7.8% against the German mark, but rose 2.3% against the
dollar.
The report argues that there is no mechanical link between changes in
the exchange rate and the inflation rate.
''Different assumptions about the reasons for the fall in the exchange
rate lead to different conclusions about the speed and extent to which
the fall will feed through to higher domestic prices.''
The Bank's assessment is that RPIX inflation will be close to the top
of its 1% to 4% target range next year and that in two years it will
still be in the upper half of the target range.
The Government, however, is committed to getting inflation down to
2.5% or less by the end of the current Parliament, a commitment which
they may well regret having made.
At least there were no nasty shocks in the official figures for
inflation last month. The Retail Price Index rose by 1% to 149.0
(January 1987 = 100). But last year's imposition of VAT on domestic fuel
dropped out of the 12-month comparison.
As a result the headline rate fell back from 3.5% in March to 3.3% and
the underlying rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments, from
2.8% to 2.6%.
However, the new RPIY measure, which also excludes indirect and local
authority taxes, presented a different picture. This rate, the one
favoured by the Bank of England, edged up from 1.9% to 2.1%.
In the last two days financial markets have been preoccupied by the
dollar's pronounced recovery against the Deutschmark and other safe
haven currencies.
Yesterday the trade-weighted index jumped from 82.8 to 83.4 as
sterling gained 2.36 pfennigs to DM2.2240, while losing 2.46 cents to
$1.5575. But the index has fallen by a full point since May 4.

A MOTHER whose three young children were found stabbed to death and
who was found drowned, feared that her house was possessed by evil
spirits, according to her church pastor last night.
Ms Joy Senior, 29, had recently called in church officials to bless
the property in Thetford, Norfolk, where the bodies of the youngsters
were discovered on Wednesday morning -- they had been stabbed to death
with a large kitchen knife.
Their mother's body was found in a woodland pond several miles away.
Pastor Bernie Holford, of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, told BBC
Radio that she had turned to them after becoming obsessed with demons in
her house.
He said: ''I can only guess at what was going through her mind. It may
have been that as a result of past relationships and people that were
involved, she may have thought other forces were at work in the house.''
Rebutting suggestions that her personality changed after contacting
the church, Pastor Holford added: ''The truth is that Joy was a very
disturbed person but she hid it very well from almost everybody. Our
church should not be condemned for trying to help her.''
Earlier, the church -- which has 18,000 members in the UK and more
than eight million followers in 206 countries worldwide -- stressed that
it was not a cult or a sect and that the dead woman was not a member,
although her parents were.
Norfolk Police say they are not seeking anyone else in connection with
the tragedy.

THE General Dental Practitioners' Association is to recommend a new
voucher scheme after claiming NHS work carried out by dentists has
fallen by a third since the 1990 NHS contract was introduced.
A survey of 30,000 dentists showed NHS work accounted for 57% of their
activity compared with 89% five years ago. Private work has gone up from
10% to 36% and other activities have risen from one per cent to 7%.
The association said the survey gave a truer picture of the flight
from NHS dentistry than traditional measures used by the Government,
such as the number of dentists with NHS contracts.
The association is due to attend talks at the Department of Health
today, when it is expected to recommend a voucher system to switch
spending from cosmetic work to helping children have healthy teeth.
According to the survey, 80% of dentists forecast a fall in their NHS
commitments over the next five years.
Association chairman Mike Clarke said: ''We want the Government to
recognise they cannot afford to fully fund a comprehensive National
Health Service.
''If they would come clean and say that, we could then start talking
about a partnership between private and National Health dentistry so the
people who gain are the patients.
''At the moment, we spend #200m of NHS money per year on children's
teeth and #176m on crowns and cosmetic dentistry. Isn't it time to spend
the cosmetic dentistry money on children instead?
''Patients could have #50 vouchers for NHS treatment which they could
subsidise from their own pockets if they wanted nice white teeth and
extra cosmetic work.''
Kirkintilloch dentist and GDPA representative, Mr Mark Gallacher, said
last night: ''The NHS picture is patchy in Scotland but generally the
further away you get from the big cities the harder it is to get an NHS
dentist. People in rural areas may have no choice but to go private.''

IT could be a sign of Paddy Connolly's ability or it could be a
measure of Dundee United's desperation, but the striker, who broke the
same leg twice earlier this season, might return to the side tomorrow
for their final premier-division match of a dismal campaign. The game
against Celtic at Tannadice is United's last chance to avoid automatic
relegation, and manager Billy Kirkwood is prepared to take drastic
action.
Connolly would be more than willing, of course, but playing him in
such a crucial match is a risk even if he has looked lively in a couple
of reserve games.
United's need is great, however, and the 24-year-old has been placed
on stand-by for a game United must win to maintain their hopes of
staying in the top flight. They are stuck at the bottom of the division,
two points behind Aberdeen, and four behind Hearts, who play Motherwell
at Tynecastle, and the best they can do is win the play-off place
provided the Dons lose at Brockville.
Ironically, Connolly suffered his first fracture in a Coca-Cola Cup
tie against Celtic in September when he challenged Mike Galloway. That
was the start of a miserable period for the United player, although he
thought his luck had turned for the better when he tried to make a
comeback earlier this year.
However, in a reserve game against Rangers he broke the same leg. It
was the most frustrating period of his career as he watched helpless
while United's season began to fall apart, but Connolly played for the
reserve side in a 2-1 win at Ibrox on Wednesday night and scored.
''Paddy has played twice this week for the second team and done
well,'' said Kirkwood. ''We have another reserve match against Aberdeen
tomorrow but he won't figure in that one.
''I will see how he looks in the next couple of days before making a
decision, but Paddy could be part of the squad.''
Connolly is capable of conjuring up a goal, and even one tomorrow
could prove priceless to United who must decide whether to use the
striker from the start or as a substitute.
Whatever he decides, Kirkwood knows there can be no passengers and
warned his players that they must make the game the toughest Celtic have
faced. ''With no disrespect to Airdrie, we simply have to ensure this
will be an even harder match for Celtic than the Scottish Cup final,''
he said.
''There are no second prizes at the end of this game and we have to
work harder than we have ever done to make sure we get a result and look
for Falkirk doing us a favour. First and foremost, though, we have to
make certain we help ourselves.''
Meanwhile, Scotland striker Duncan Shearer believes Aberdeen's season
of torment will continue to the play-offs before saving their premier
division place. But Shearer is certain the Pittodrie club will avoid the
biggest disaster in their history by being relegated.
Shearer, who has signed a deal tieing him to Aberdeen for the rest of
his career, admitted: ''No-one has done us any favours and we cannot
expect any now. This is D-Day and we've got to survive by our own
efforts. Realistically it will probably take the play-offs to do this
but there is no reason why we cannot stay up.
''When we are safe we must look back on this season and vow that we
are never in this situation again. If we get in trouble we must escape
much earlier, rather than have our fate hanging on one game.''
''Falkirk will be difficult, especially as we have so many players
injured or suspended. But I have a good record at Brockville.''

Allan Laing talks to pint-sized Brian McCardie who landed a big role
in Rob Roy
THE director was looking for an aggressive wee Scotsman -- and Brian
McCardie was pretty near perfect for the role. You want aggressive?
Brian can be pushy when he wants to be. Wee? Yup, he's not the size of
tuppence. And a Scot? No problem, he comes from Carluke.
And so it was that the young actor found himself in a kilt on a
mist-shrouded Highland mountainside, brandishing a claymore which was
almost as heavy as he was. In Rob Roy he plays Liam Neeson's younger
brother, a well-intentioned hothead whose impetuosity leads to tragedy.
''I tried to make him incapable of his tasks so that he would show
more humanity and make him a more sympathetic character. And, to be
honest, there's no point trying to play some kind of tough guy when
you're standing next to Liam Neeson,'' he explains.
McCardie auditioned in London for the key role in the Hollywood
blockbuster without any great expectation of success. He was, after all,
relatively unknown and one of a small army of British hopefuls who
tested for the part. But Scots director Michael Caton-Jones, who can
smell a duff Scottish accent from 1000 paces, took a shine to him.
The actor was given enormous scope to play the part the way he wanted
to play it. ''I suppose,'' he says, not entirely seriously, ''I was
trying to play Daniel Day Lewis in Last of the Mohicans only I was
playing him as Thumper in Bambi. When actors get shot or wounded too
many of them behave like some kind of superhuman. I tried not to.''
McCardie is disarmingly modest (almost to the point of diffidence)
about his latest screen success. But there is a reason for this.
''I'm not actorish. I've got this theory that an actor's job is to be
as truthful as possible and place his character on earth. The further
you feed your ego and remove yourself from normality, the less chance
you have of delivering a convincing performance.
''I really don't take it too seriously because acting's just a job --
and not a particularly significant one. My mum's a nurse and that's a
significant job,'' he says.
There is not the merest hint of vanity about Brian McCardie. He is
neither luvvie-darling nor tough-maccho-Scotsman. He is, however, coy
about his age (to look at him, he must be around mid-to-late 20s).
Again, there is a sound reason for this. He reckons that casting
directors tend to pigeon-hole actors in age groups and he believes that,
by not broadcasting his, he can get a wider range of parts.
And so to the Life of Brian. After school in Lanarkshire, he went to
study law at Glasgow Tech -- but he left almost before he arrived. ''I
tried law and became very good at pool,'' he remarks. After a short
spell in the ranks of the unemployed, he applied for (and got) a grant
which took him to a BA Honours course in theatre arts at the Rose
Bruford College of Speech and Drama, in Sidcup, Kent.
''I remember they put me on a warning for my RP (received
pronunciation). I can do it now but, when I arrived at college from
Scotland, they didn't accept that I couldn't speak like someone from
Surrey. I had this big argument with them. They weren't prepared to give
me any special lessons,'' he recalls.
Still, after three years he emerged with his degree -- but not with
his all-important Equity Card. He then lied his way into a pantomime in
Leatherhead (''Of course I can sing and dance,'' he told them) and
eventually gained entry to the union. His first breakthrough came with a
regular part in a short-lived BBC cop series, Waterfront Beat. It was,
he says, ''pretty mediocre'' but 35 weeks solid in front of a camera
taught him more about acting than any college course could.
''I've no time for those who say that, to become an actor, you have to
work in theatre. That's bullshit. The theatre is only one aspect and the
training you get in front of a camera is every bit as important. It's
ideal to do both, of course, but I don't like people who say that only
the theatre is the real thing,'' he explains.
McCardie then had a variety of television parts, including a leading
role in a Channel 4 film, Forget About Me, a rights-of-passage story
about two Scots soldiers who go off to Budapest to see a Simple Minds
concert and become involved with the same girl. He has also appeared in
Dr Finlay and in the Edinburgh Fringe.
But there is no denying that his role in Rob Roy is the biggest thing
he has done to date.
''Liam Neeson was a gentleman. He was like a big generous uncle to me,
always there to advise me and help me. Michael Caton-Jones was also
great. I can't thank him enough for everything he did,'' he says.
But it was Jessica Lange, with whom Brian has a memorable and
emotionally charged scene, who came closest to overawing the young
actor.
''She'd come over here from another continent and she was the only
female star in a very demanding role. She was fairly quiet and subdued
when she arrived. I was scared because I had this major scene to do with
her.
''The other thing was that she'd given one of the best acting
performances I'd ever seen -- in Frances, a film about the 1950s
American actress Frances Farmer who went mad. So I went up to her on the
first day and talked incessantly to her and I think she thought I was
off my head. But it broke down all my fears and my inhibitions because I
wanted to do my job well and I couldn't afford to be terrified,'' he
says.
After returning to his London home from last month's glittering New
York premiere for Rob Roy (''It was so much like a zoo that it was more
amusing than frightening,'' he says) Brian's phone began to get a lot of
calls from people with American accents. He is currently in Los Angeles
talking to them face-to-face.
''I just decided to go out and see for myself. An American publicist
offered to represent me for nothing and invited me to come out. She
scheduled a lot of meetings with people.
''I don't necessarily see myself living over there and trying to be
some kind of Scottish Tim Roth. I just want to do good work. I've never
been to LA before and I'm a bit ignorant of the system over there. But
who knows,'' he adds.

THEY are by no stretch of the imagination the meanest, baddest guys on
the planet. In fact, Frank Bruno and Mike Evans, who do battle at
Glasgow's Kelvin Hall tomorrow night, are courteous, jovial fellows --
when you get them on their own.
Put them together, however, just a couple of days before each will
attempt to dismantle the other, and the mixture is highly charged.
That's what happened for a brief minute yesterday when the heavyweight
pair met for the first time in a Glasgow hotel.
Bruno will be hoping that this is his last fight before challenging
Oliver McCall for the World Boxing Council championship some time this
summer -- and Evans has said from the minute he arrived in Scotland
earlier this week that his aim is to make sure Bruno doesn't keep that
date with McCall.
Promoter Frank Warren, who a year ago promised to bring big boxing
names to Scotland and who has kept that promise, fired a broadside at
certain sections of the media -- mainly in England -- for negative
publicity surrounding this particular promotion. And word has it that
the Kelvin Hall is nowhere near being a sell-out.
When asked if he was disappointed at this, Bruno glanced across at
Evans and said: ''I'm not concerned about bums on seats. The only bum I
want to see on its seat is his.''
The American contingent growled back, obviously thinking the big
Londoner had called their man a bum, the ultimate insult to an American
fighter.
Bruno, forever the diplomat, took the heat out of the situation. He
said: ''I'm not calling him a bum. I respect him, just as I respect
every other boxer, whether he is a flyweight or a heavyweight. In fact,
when some people said he was bloated they showed disrespect.
''He looks a big, strong, fresh opponent. I'm not underestimating him
in any way -- but it's my time, my year, and I'm going to win the world
title. Mike Evans has never faced anyone with as heavy a punch as me and
he is not going to stand in my way.''
Evans, as he has done all week, smiled a lot and said: ''It will be a
battle and I'm here to win. I've heard about the people who have been
criticising me, but they haven't seen me in action, and I just dismiss
that.''
Craig Johnson, who trains Evans, says, however, that the negative
criticism will only serve to fire up his man even more.
An angry Warren said: ''They are having a go at the man without having
seen him. That's showing no respect. It seems some people are out to
destroy this show. I can do without those sort of politics. It stinks.
''What is it about Frank Bruno? He has been good for boxing, brought
people to the sport, and is one win away from a world title chance.''
As well as Bruno against Evans, Warren will stage at least another
dozen contests on the night, including one for the British cruiserweight
title, the comeback of a former world champion, and the appearance of
several young Scots.
The championship contest is between Dennis Andries and Terry Dunstan
while Chris Pyatt, the former WBO middleweight champion, tries to kick
start his career against Anthony Ivory, from America. The Scots on the
bill are Dave Anderson, of Glasgow, who meets Alfreton's G G Goddard in
what will, hopefully, be his last fight before challenging for the
British title, James Murray (Cleland), Tanveer Ahmed (Glasgow), Gordon
Blair (Glasgow), and Brian Carr (Moodiesburn).

NERVE will play a crucial role on Sunday afternon when Blackburn
Rovers and Manchester United complete their Premiership schedules, and
by the time the dust settles on Anfield and Upton Park, one of these
clubs will be left standing as champions.
Rovers' manager, Kenny Dalglish, may predict he will finally usurp
fellow Scot, Alex Ferguson, but much will depend on the attitude of
their opponents.
It is not necessary to be a fully paid-up cynic to accept United
appear to have the more difficult task against West Ham, who secured
their Premiership place by beating Liverpool 3-0 on Wednesday night.
Also, Aston Villa beat Liverpool 2-0 last Saturday, and these results
suggests the Anfield side's players have switched off, that their
thoughts may already be on sun-kissed beaches, and long, cool drinks by
poolsides. Also, Liverpool fans will be welcoming back one of their
favourite sons, Dalglish, who was a hero at Anfield as player and
manager.
Although he walked away a few seasons ago saying the pressures of the
game had taken too much of a toll only to return to football as manager
of Blackburn and a big spender of Jack Walker's millions, Dalglish
retains a special place in the hearts of most Liverpool fans.
It is difficult to imagine the masses or the players for that matter
making a great effort to rise against him on Sunday.
If they do manage to rediscover a will to win, and that is not always
possible when the edge has gone from a team, they may contribute to
another championship success for their great rivals, Manchester United,
who will be playing in London knowing they need all three points while
hoping Blackburn lose.
Belief in the pride professional footballers ought to have in their
work suggests all four teams will be giving their all, but strange
things can happen in football, especially at the end of a long season,
as Brian McClair already knows. Indeed, the United midfield player will
draw heavily on personal experience of a last-day title decider.
United's 2-1 win over Southampton kept alive their dream of becoming
only the third club to win the title three season in a row --
Huddersfield, Arsenal, and, ironically, Liverpool have achieved that
distinction -- but rather than be pessimistic, McClair was anxious to
find positive omens in what happened to him while with Celtic.
''It's a test of nerves now. The same situation occurred in 1986 when
I was at Celtic Park,'' said the 31-year-old striker-turned midfield
player whose consistency this season has been a key factor in keeping
the Old Trafford side in the championship race.
''Hearts were ahead all the way but on the last day, they were beaten
by Dundee United, while we beat St Mirren to win it. I scored twice that
day as well.
''So I know what it will be like on Sunday. If we can go a couple of
goals in front early we'll be listening for any information we can get
from Anfield, and then just hope Blackburn don't win.
''But this is the first time for a while that we've managed to get up
near to Blackburn's position. I'm sure that will make a difference to
them. As I know, everything can change on the last day, and it is be
nice to think history might repeat itself.''
McClair will not make the mistake of writing off Harry Redknapp's
side, however. ''It will be a very difficult game,'' he stressed.
''They're safe from relegation and can go out and enjoy themselves.''
Still, the Scottish internationalist remains confident United's will
to win will see them through, as it has done many times already this
season.
The championship appeared to be Blackburn's for the taking just three
weeks ago after United were held 0-0 by Chelsea at Old Trafford, but
defeats by Manchester City and West Ham allowed Ferguson's side to close
the gap to only two points. ''We never gave up at any stage,'' said
McClair.
''That determination is one of the main characteristics of this United
team. It doesn't matter what position we're in, we never give up on
anything.
''When you are champions it's such a pleasant feeling and so good that
you just become hungrier and hungrier.
''You want to have success all the time, you want to win
championships, and you want to go back to Wembley.
''The manager made a point about that a few months ago and I think
we've responded well while the younger players, those who haven't
experienced that success, are just as hungry for it.''
Ferguson, meanwhile, paid tribute to the efforts of those fresh-faced
players, especially Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, and Paul Scholes. ''It's
very tiring for young players when they're asked to perform like men,
and they're bound to make mistakes. Everybody does,'' he said.
''It says much for them that they kept on plugging away and they have
shown tremendous determination to do well. They've proved themselves to
be Manchester United players.''
However, the championship is not the only item up for decision south
of the Border this, because Crystal Palace's players will try to put the
issue of manager Alan Smith's future to the back of their minds on
Sunday for the crucial Premiership match at Newcastle.
Palace's place in the top flight would be secure if they were to pull
off an unlikely victory at St James' Park and if Aston Villa came
unstuck at Norwich.
Smith and chairman Ron Noades do not see eye to eye and the Newcastle
game could well be the last in charge at Selhurst Park for the current
manager.
The players, however, are determined that managerial matters should
not deflect from the issue in hand. Captain Gareth Southgate said: ''We
should be big and experienced enough to put the issue of the manager to
the back of our minds. We know we have to try and get a result. We can't
rely on others.
''I believe we can get the win we need if we keep it tight. We have
the ability to pull out a result when it is needed.''
But Smith is aware that the odds are against his side, who came up as
last season's first division champions. Newcastle have only lost one
home match in 16 months and are eager to clinch a place in the UEFA Cup.
Villa go to Norwich, needing a point to avoid the drop -- and the mood
in the camp is upbeat, with defender Paul McGrath claiming: ''There is
no point in just aiming for a draw. We have got to go there to try and
win and get all three points.''

JURGEN Klinsmann has decided to leave Tottenham at the end of the
season and return to his native Germany.
The internationalist has opted to accept an offer from Bayern Munich,
which includes the opportunity of an unspecified job after his playing
career ends.
Klinsmann told a news conference in London yesterday: ''This has been
the most difficult decision of my life. At 31 I had to carefully
consider my final career move. I have never won a national title and
there is not much time left to do so. I want to build up my life and
career after football, and Bayern have given me the opportunity.
''I think it will take some time for Tottenham to build up a side to
compete with Manchester United and Blackburn for the championship.
''I have opportunities to further my career from Bayern. They have
offered me all sorts of possibilities after playing for the next three
years which will take me up to the World Cup finals.''
Klinsmann said that Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar, manager Gerry
Francis, and his playing colleagues had attempted to persuade him to
stay. ''I have enjoyed myself here. Everyone has been great -- even the
English public.''
Klinsmann denied that death threats recently made against him or his
rough treatment by Everton fans after the FA Cup semi-final had
influenced his decision.
''They were just a few crazy guys. It was no big deal, no problem,''
he said. The striker will make his final appearance in a Tottenham shirt
against Leeds on Sunday.
Klinsmann denied that his move to Bayern was for financial reasons.
''If the decision was financial, I would have gone to Italy. I had
plenty of offers from there.''

ANDRE Agassi and Pete Sampras, the world's top two players, face major
tests of their form on clay at the German Open in Hamburg today in the
run-up to this month's French Open.
World No.1 Agassi beat little-known Czech Slava Dosedel 6-2, 6-1 to
move into a quarter-final against Sergi Bruguera, the Paris champion,
whose Dutch opponent, Richard Krajicek, retired because of injury.
Sampras, the world No.2, had to work hard for a 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 win over
another Czech, Daniel Vacek, to earn a clash with South African Wayne
Ferreira, winner of last week's Munich Open, who beat local hero Michael
Stich 7-5, 6-1 -- his second win over the former Wimbledon champion in
five days.
In the other quarters, Croatian fourth seed Goran Ivanisevic meets
Swiss Marc Rosset, while last year's winner, Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev,
plays Italian Andrea Gaudenzi.
* GABRIELA Sabatini's hopes of a fifth Italian Open title were ended
by an inspired Helen Sukova in the third round in Rome yesterday. The
30-year-old Czech saved five match points in a 2-6, 7-6, 7-6 win over
the No.4 seed, who again let victory slip from her grasp.
In the second set, the Czech broke Sabatini twice, in the tenth and
twelfth games. Sukova won tie-break 7-3 and fought back from 0-3 in a
seesaw third set. Sabatini led 5-3 in the tie-break but Sukova won five
of the next six points.

THEATRE du Kronope's French-language adaptation of the Victor Hugo
novel is a study of manipulating men and exploited women. Concentrating
less on the forlorn figure of Quasimodo, it is more the story of
Esmeralda who goes through a succession of unscrupulous suitors, gets
falsely imprisoned for murder, and is eventually hanged after refusing
to compromise her honour.
Performed on a large, circular tilted platform representing a window
of Notre Dame, Guy Simon's production has a clean, no-nonsense
theatricality about it, an exercise in crisp, direct story-telling. And
you quickly lose count of the number of characters the six actors,
wearing a succession of half-masks, get through.
Though the masks hark back to the robust performance tradition of
commedia dell'arte, there is a politeness about the production that
undermines the company's physical approach. Apart from the elephant-man
style face-piece of the hunchback, many of the masks have little to
distinguish them and the actors' physical gestures are too often more
pretty than purposeful.
They do save some grotesquery for later on and, aside from the fact
that it's late in the play to be introducing new characters, there are
big nods towards the kind of knockabout comedy this style suits so well.
Mention should also be made of the vertiginous scene in which
Quasimodo appears to swing across the facade of the cathedral, throwing
our perspective awry. But for all this and several heartfelt
performances, I was largely unmoved.

THERE is no questioning the ambition of Cathie Boyd's Theatre Cryptic.
Every theatrical device in the toolbox is there for this company's use
and they employ them all. This show uses two languages (French and
English), a set by sculptor Alex Rigg that is like an outsided modular
toy from the Early Learning Centre and quite unlike anything I've seen
before on a stage, and specially composed music, played live on
electronically treated 'cello and piano. The cast comprises a Danish
opera singer and two very physical Canadian actors and one French
performer.
It is great to see a lot of imagination being poured into a
production, but I'm not sure that this much helps Michele Roberts's
script. While there is an admirable aural clarity to the show, both
vocally and musically -- and singer Marianne Cotteril is one of the
production's best points -- visually things are much more muddily
conceived, and that is not the fault of Paul Sorley's attractive
lighting design. Rather it is the difficulty with the set, the use of
which creates more problems than it solves. I thought Rigg's stitched
plywood panels and doors quite pretty (others disagreed), but they
seemed actor-friendly only when Stephane Theoret was flinging himself
violently against them. Employed as the home of childless couple Annie
(Renee Madeleine le Guerrier) and Daniel (Theoret) they were a distant
jumble, as an upstage chapel (a wonderfully powerful vocal moment of
prayer) they were a miniature joke.
Roberts's fable of a couple whose failure to communicate draws Annie
to seek the assistance of the supernatural Lady at Noire Fontaine
(Cotterill), cries out for rather less than Boyd and her cohorts want to
give. But given the development of last year's Bonjour Tristesse, file
under ''work in progress''.

THERE has been some strange behaviour among sports authorities in
recent times but maybe we should not be too surprised at that. The
history of every pro game is peppered with daft decisions, mysterious
rulings, and arrogant pronouncements, but a couple this week do provide
a contrast which leaves the old brainbox befuddled.
On one hand, a snooker player at the centre of a suspicious betting
controversy is banned for five years for apparently not trying, but is
seemingly exonerated from having anything to do with the alleged unusual
betting pattern.
On the other hand, the Chester stewards decided to do nothing about a
horse which won their major cup race after having been the subject of a
''non-trier' investigation following his previous race.
Whatever the findings of the snooker authority were based on, it seems
remarkable that a professional player can be found guilty of a breach of
a rule which, in effect, refers to playing below best form (surely a
euphemism for not trying), yet no mention of the original reason for the
inquiry being called, the betting suspicions, is forthcoming.
Maybe they had good reason and maybe there were legal restraints but
the distant observer has to wonder if Peter Francisco has been seen to
be treated justly.
At least the snooker people did something. The Chester stewards
managed to turn a Nelson eye to the most audacious piece of
prize-snatching seen in the racing game for a long time. They decided to
ask no questions, demand no explanations, from the connections of a
horse which had been the cause of a mighty furore when it had been,
either accidentally or deliberately, denied a winning chance in its
previous race, which was worth #27,000 less than the #30,000 first prize
for winning the Chester Cup on Wednesday.
Top Cees, ridden by Kieran Fallon, had been ''ridden tenderly,'' to
use that quaint official description, in his previous race at Newmarket,
when the jockey admitted afterwards that he had misjudged things and
overdid the waiting tactics to finish fifth three weeks previously.
The Newmarket stewards did call the trainer, Lynda Ramsden, and her
jockey to task but accepted their explanations. Even so, the Jockey Club
was concerned enough to conduct an inquiry of its own but accepted the
Newmarket stewards' findings.
That Newmarket race was over a mile and six furlongs and might have
been planned as a nice warm-up for the two-and-a-quarter mile Chester
Cup, despite the fact that the horse had had only ever won over a mile
on the Flat.
It seems reasonable to suggest that a Chester coup was in operation,
as Top Cees was well fancied in the market at 8-1, and,indeed, if so, it
was successful, as the ''unlucky' horse of a few weeks ago not only
cruised in by five lengths but left two of his Newmarket opponents miles
behind. Wellbeloved and Thunderheart, who cae home in front of Top Cees
then, were lost in the chasing pack.
Now, it may well be that much of this is down to coincidence and
circumstance. Yes, it might, really.
It could be that Top Cees was meant to win at Newmarket and then win
again at Chester, carrying a 3lb penalty, but the plan went slightly
awry; it could be that we are getting far too cynical and imagine
chicanery when none exists; and it could well be that Colonel Gaddafi
will be Prime Minister of Israel.
If a horse which has never won beyond a mile wins a major race over
more than twice that distance after being the subject of ''tender
riding'' in its previous race, who are we to jump to conclusions? Still,
it would have been of some comfort to the many lovers of the old Turf
business if the Chester stewards had at least called some folk in to
ask: How come?

THE two stunning goals which sent Arsenal to defeat in the European
Cup-winners' Cup final in Paris on Wednesday night underlined the
difference between the football which is demonstrated in these islands
and the more beautiful game which is played across Europe.
Forget the element of luck in the winner scored by Real Zaragoza's
Nayim and simply ask yourself: ''How many players in the Arsenal team
would have tried to score that goal?''
Similarly, the first goal from the Argentinian striker, Esnaider, was
another goal of the highest class.
Afterwards, Arsenal stand-in manager Stewart Houston admitted: ''At
both goals I did not realise the danger to us until the ball was in the
net.
''I just did not expect them to go in . . . but they were both
magnificent strikes. I have to hold my hands up to that.''
Houston could have taken refuge by claiming that Nayim was lucky. He
did not choose to do so even in the deepest disappointment he has known
as a team manager.
Instead, he recognised that the one-time Spurs player had attempted to
score. Luck certainly came into it as the ball dropped beyond the
despairing David Seaman. But it had arrived because of the imagination
shown by the player.
That was the basic difference between the teams at the Parc des
Princes. Zaragoza had imagination in plenty. The probing passes and
penetrating runs of their captain, Pardeza, demonstrated that.
The man who is known as ''Mighty Mouse'' in Spain was bought from Real
Madrid eight years ago at a bargain price. It was hard to believe that,
and equally hard to see how Arsenal could stop him as he was the
mainspring of the Zaragoza team.
The number of shots on goal emphasised that the Spaniards were a team
looking for openings and always ready to try to exploit them. Out of 28
attempts at goal, Zaragoza had 22 of them.
Arsenal had just six yet they almost took the game to a penalty kick
decider and if that had happened we might have seen a repeat of the
semi-final against Sampdoria which they won with Seaman as the hero.
But, while Pardeza inspired his team with his skills, Arsenal were
eventually left without the leadership of Tony Adams which has so often
lifted them.
The powerful defender struggled with injury for most of the second
half and throughout the period of extra-time. His drive was diminished
and, therefore, so was that of his team.
In contrast, Pardeza grew in stature as the game wore on. On this form
it is hard to understand why he has won only five caps for his country.
Arsenal had gone to Paris insisting that they would stick with their
British-style game. There are strengths in our game. Don't doubt that.
And Arsenal are a prime example of the style of play in Britain.
But, this time, they found a Spanish side who were ready to match
them, who did not fear them, and who, while they may not have had the
collective will of the Londoners, had the imagination which can win
games, and trophies.
They had the ability to conjure goals out of nothing. Their players
had that special vision which can set them apart from the more obvious,
more pedestrian, more orthodox men who wore the Arsenal shirts.
The first strike might have been a candidate for goal of the season
until, of course, it was eclipsed by Nayim's winner.
Lucky? Yes. But the player was willing to take the risk, he was
willing to go for goal when he thought the chance was there.
He had the imagination that could not be matched by any Arsenal player
and that is why Zaragoza took the cup back to Aragon.
Few players in our game would have seen the chance. Even fewer would
have tried to score. Because our players conform. They do not like to
try the unexpected. Perhaps the imagination has been destroyed by the
constant slog of the Premiership in England and the premier division in
Scotland.
Therein lies the difference in our soccer philosophies. In Europe
imagination remains more important than hard work.
Perhaps we should go back to encouraging players to try the outrageous
-- just as Nayim did to win the Cup-winners' Cup for Real Zaragoza.

<HEADLINE>CBI survey sees upsurge in  April retail sales</HEADLINE>

THERE was a sharp upsurge in annual retail sales in April after two
consecutive monthly falls, says the CBI in its monthly Distributive
Trades Survey.
This is much in line with what firms were forecasting in March -- the
first time this year expectations have proved to be correct -- but it
still leaves the three-monthly trend showing flat underlying sales
volumes on a year-on-year basis after March's slight decline.
Most retailers, though, reported some growth in sales in the year to
April. Sales for the time of year were seen as a little below average
but to the least extent so far in 1995.
Orders placed on suppliers rose moderately for the first time since
last December despite the fact that stocks continue to be considered
more than adequate in relation to expected demand.
The volume of retail sales is expected to grow at a similar rate in
May as in April -- although the growth in High Street trade has been
broadly as anticipated only three times in the past 12 months. Sales for
the time of year are expected to remain slightly below average in May.
Meanwhile, orders placed on suppliers are expected to grow further, even
though stocks are projected to more than match demand.
Last month, the largest sales volume increases were reported by
footwear and leather shops, followed by chemists, grocers, booksellers
and stationers. The only significant decrease compared with a year ago
was reported by specialist food shops.
Wholesalers' volumes rose sharply in the year to April, picking up at
a faster rate than had been anticipated. Consequently, wholesalers
perceived sales as well above average for the time of year. Sales are
expected to grow further though more moderately than in April.
For motor traders there is a little relief. Their sales fell for the
fourth successive month but the year-on-year reduction in volumes was
the smallest so far this year and much less than expected. However,
business for the time of year remained well below average and more so
than at any time since last October.
Commenting on the retail sales outcome, Alastair Eperon, chairman of
the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey Panel, said: ''The pick-up in sales
in April was much as retailers expected, as business improved around the
Easter period. The three-monthly trend shows shows a less buoyant
picture, with underlying volumes little higher than a year ago.

PLUNGING tea prices and a surging Kenyan shilling knocked
Glasgow-based tea giant James Finlay off the boil last year.
Pre-tax profits after exceptionals plunged 47%, from #13.8m to #7.25m.
A #614,000 transfer from reserves was necessary to fund an unchanged
total dividend of 4.15p, after a final payout of 2.15p.
Shares lost 3p to 64p, although the 1994 figures were close to
forecasts made at the time of a profits warning in January.
However, the past few days have seen the only significant weakening of
the Kenyan shilling, which is currently trading around 80/#, for about
eight months.
By the end of last year the shilling, which had been trading at about
100/# at the start, had scalped the US dollar and sterling on the
foreign exchanges and appreciated to about 67/#.
Operating profits from James Finlay's tea plantations, a large
proportion of which are in Kenya, plunged from #11.4m to #6.8m as a
result of the shilling's strength and a drop in tea prices everywhere in
the second half. Wages in Kenya were also set during a period of very
high inflation, squeezing margins.
There was also a #3m swing in the results of the company's UK and
Mombasa-based tea trading operations, which moved from a #1.8m profit in
1993 to a #1.2m loss last year.
For the first time in many years, tea trading was hit by bad debts.
The UK business, which is expanding into Eastern Europe, suffered as a
result of non-payment for an uninsured shipment to Poland worth about
#500,000.
The Mombasa trading division encountered bad-debt problems in business
with Egypt -- of a magnitude never encountered before. Matters were
exacerbated by exchange rate factors.
However, with James Finlay having refocused on the core activities
which made its name, it now appears in better shape going forward.
During the year, the company sustained a #3.25m loss on the closure of
its sole remaining oil and gas interests in the US.
Executive chairman Richard Muir said: ''We knew we were going to have
a bloodbath when we did it. It is not a business we are good at and I am
relieved we are out of it.''
The drive by James Finlay to reduce its financial services interests
is continuing apace.
An agreement for the sale of its investment management company in
Houston, Texas, is in place.
It is also negotiating the sale of trade finance and leasing companies
in Australia and New Zealand, hopeful of a full disposal in New Zealand
but expecting only a partial sale in Australia.
The move will produce cash for the development of James Finlay's 40%
stake, acquired in February last year, in tea estates in Uganda
abandoned during the reign of tyrant Idi Amin.
Operating profits from confectionery and beverage manufacturing rose
10% to #4.33m, helped by the expansion of supermarket giant Sainsbury,
whose tea and coffee packing is done exclusively by James Finlay.
The Glasgow company incurred redundancy costs of about #680,000. These
related to James Finlay Bank, whose corporate finance side has been
closed and whose lending book is being run down, and the streamlining of
the George Payne confectionery business.
A new instant tea factory in Sri Lanka, a country James Finlay has
been in for more than 100 years, will allow it to exploit the booming
demand in the US and Far East for cold canned teas.
On the plantations side, crops in Kenya are up on last year but they
are suffering in Bangladesh as a result of extremely dry weather.
Prices in Kenya are fair but, in Mr Muir's words, ''pretty awful'' in
Bangladesh.
Although the company is confident about tea trading, its overall
result is at the mercy of tea prices and exchange rates, which are
obviously beyond James Finlay's control.

THIS is a year when Grand Metropolitan seems likely to go nowhere in
terms of overall profitability despite its increasing its marketing
spend to over #1000m for the first time and chairman Lord Sheppard
saying the company is in its best shape since it was founded in 1962 by
the late Maxwell Joseph.
At the halfway stage, pre-tax profits edged ahead by just 0.7% to
#441m although that is after the #37m body blow administered by the
Swedish Government when its withdrew the Absolut vodka distributorship
in the US.
The cost or loss of operating profit in the full year is put at about
#60m and was the fourth-largest contributor to the IDV subsidiary's
income flow. Top comes J&amp;B Rare, the world's second-biggest Scotch at
#135m, Baileys at #100m and Smirnoff vodka at #95m.
Overall IDV volumes edged ahead by 2% although dollar weakness removed
much of the benefit with profits also under pressure from the increase
in advertising.
Not that shareholders should object to that, being an investment in
the future of a sector which still remains one of the most profitable of
all with margins usually running at around 15%. There is concern that
IDV has too great a dependence upon North America at around 40% of its
business and where the long-term spirits trend is an annual 2% fall.
In contast, Allied Domecq and Guinness generate about 15% and 25% of
profits respectively from that territory.
However, new products and selling existing well-developed brands into
emerging new markets should ensure moderate long-term growth.
Rumours that Burger King is to be sold before the end of this year
were denied despite their persistence. The activity brought in an extra
#15m at #91m, helped by a #26m contribution from churning franchises
compared with a #14m gain last time. Happily for the quality of
earnings, this feature will become less important with just #10m to
accrue in the current six months.
The hunt for a new chief executive officer continues although the
fast-food system is gaining market share from McDonalds and Wendy's.
Solid results came from the Pilsbury foods in the US from dough to
canned vegetables although Europe was a somewhat different matter.
Even if the loss-making Haagen-Dazs ice-cream is excluded -- which
soaks up a huge amount of promotional expense -- profitability remains
highly unsatisfactory with GrandMet achieving market leadership in many
niche bakery areas but to little avail as regards profits. The stated
intention is to soldier on -- but the assets could be more gainfully
employed elsewhere.
Haagen-Dazs sales worldwide are around $1000m with a 10% operating
margin. Japan is the profitable although unfortunately it is only
half-owned.
The Pearle eye-care subsidiary is effectively up for sale now with
profits of just #3m on turnover of #183m obviously not paying for its
keep.
In January, GrandMet bought the Pet manufacturer of Mexican foods for
#2100m. This is apparently performing better than expected although it
has raised stated gearing to 93% with debt amounting to #3110m.
If the value of the brands is excluded from the balance sheet, as the
more prudent are wont to do, and counting the perpetual Preference
shares as debt, then gearing becomes infinite -- but then GrandMet
shareholders have lived with this state of affairs for years with an
interest cover of over eight times the fallback.
With cost-saving benefits in line with the increased advertising
spend, it seems likely that full-year profits will hold steady at around
last time's #945m at best. That would leave the shares, down 12p at
390p, trading at 14 times likely earnings which seems high enough.
The interim dividend has been raised slightly to 5.5p with a 15p total
probable for a 4.8% yield.

RANGERS will be pursuing their interest in Paul Gascoigne today hoping
to have words with the Lazio player's agents and, despite activity south
of the Border, the Ibrox club remain favourites to buy his signature,
but even if he does put pen to paper that won't satisfy Walter Smith,
who intends enticing at least one other top-class performer to join the
premier-division champions.
That player will not be Jurgen Klinsmann, however, because the German
internationalist said yesterday that he would be returning home to play
the remainder of his career with Bayern Munich.
After having been bold enough to move for Gascoigne, the Ibrox side's
manager is capable of attempting to sign just about any player, but he
must choose carefully because everyone he buys will have to be capable
of helping Rangers again achieve something in the Champions League. The
Swede, Jesper Blomqvist, remains a possibility and so, too, does Raith
Rovers' young player Stephen Crawford.
Word on football's grapevine has it that Rangers have already secured
his move from Starks Park to Ibrox and only recently the Scottish
under-21 internationalist himself said signing for Rangers would be his
ideal move. However, Smith is likely to have opposition from Motherwell,
who made an offer for Crawford earlier in the year.
It was suggested Alex McLeish had offered #800,000 but that was much
more than was actually bid although there would have been a provision to
increase the fee depending on what Crawford achieved. Having just
secured second place in the premier division and, therefore, a place in
next season's UEFA Cup, Motherwell may make a second and more expensive
attempt to sign the 21-year-old striker.
Even though he signed Shaun McSkimming, Eddie May, and Michel van der
Gaag, the manager has not spent all of his allowance which was generated
largely through the sales of Phil O'Donnell and Sieb Dykstra and McLeish
has not given up hope of landing Crawford.
McLeish has shown in his first season as a manager that he may have
what it takes and, having set standards, he won't want to see them fall
next season.
''When I took over I thought it would be hard to finish third in the
division again and I was really just aiming to get the players
performing well because I thought Motherwell were a breath of fresh air
in a poor league last season,'' he said. ''Also, if I'm being honest, I
just didn't want to mess up.''
He didn't, and in the first half of the season, until his squad was
reduced because of injuries, he had Motherwell playing in an
entertaining fashion with the emphasis on passing and movement.
''However, while I want to see my players look for the ball and use it I
think I have learned they can't do that in every game,'' McLeish added.
''We suffered at times this season because we wanted to do that all
the time and didn't take the conditions and the opposition into
consideration often enough.''
There were times this season when Motherwell's freshman to the
managerial ranks doubted the wisdom of attempting the step from player
to manager and when the Fir Park side lost 6-1 to Dundee United in
January he was shocked. ''But I wasn't really hurt by that result
because it was a freak occurrence. We tossed goals away that day,''
McLeish said.
Motherwell complete their domestic programme with a match against
Hearts at Tynecastle and the prospect of contributing to the downfall of
the man he succeeded at Fir Park has entered McLeish's mind.
''Tommy McLean laid the foundations here and I suppose I have thought
about what might happen if we beat Hearts on Saturday, but neither me
nor the players can afford to think about that,'' he said. ''I want to
finish on a high and the players know I don't like slackness so they
won't have their holiday heads on.''

TORRIE Stockbrokers National Men's League leaders Grange and their
nearest challengers, MIM, clash in a match which is being billed as a
championship decider tomorrow at Meadowbank.
MIM, who trail their city rivals by two points with three series of
games remaining, have lost three players to German side Frankfurt 1880,
so their coach, Chris Sutherland, has been on a recruitment drive to
England.
Jon Roberts, who plays for MIM indoors, will be part of a quartet who
will make the journey north. He already has played for them this season,
in their last outing when they beat Western 1-0. James McBlane, the
Scottish under-21 international of Beeston, and the Surbiton pair Nigel
D'Cruiz and Dave Cook make up the quartet.
* NIKKI Klepplang is a shock inclusion in the Scottish women's squad
for the Four Nations tournament in Cardiff this weekend against Belgium,
Ireland, and Wales.
Klepplang, of Bonagrass Grove, has been called in by coach Neil
Menzies because of ''a dearth of strikers'' in the squad.

OLYMPIC silver medallist Ray Stevens was Britain's hero as they made a
fine start to the European Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor
Arena yesterday.
He hoisted former world champion Stephane Traineau, of France, over
his shoulder in the under-95kg division to become one of five British
semi-finalists from eight categories contested.
Stevens, runner-up in these championships a year ago, got off to a
nervy start against Timo Peltola, of Finland.
''Although I won, I didn't win the way I would have liked. I knew I
had to go up a class against Traineau,'' he said.
The Londoner was as good as his word. A whirlwind start unsettled the
Frenchman, before that dazzling throw settled the contest. Results
(Britain unless stated):
Men. Under-78kg: R Birch beat T Crean (Ireland), Birch beat O Smadga
(Israel), Birch beat J Wahlberge (Sweden). Under-86kg: A Croitoru
(Romania) beat W Lakin. Under-95kg: R Stevens beat T Peltola (Finland),
Stevens beat S Traineau (France). Over-95kg: I Pertelson (Estonia) beat
D Sargent. Repecharge: J Kolbl (Czech Republic) beat Sargent.
Women. Under-61kg: D Bell beat G Hammerung (Switzerland), Bell beat I
Vatiekunaite (Lithuania). Under-66kg: R Sweatman beat A Polvaiae
(Moldova), Sweatman beat A Mroz (Poland). Under-72kg: K Howey beat B
Walczak (Poland), Howey beat R Groborzova (Czech Republic). Over-72kg: J
Hagn (Germany) beat J Horton.

CHAMPIONS Heriot's have banked full points from their first two
matches, but they may have a struggle to maintain that record when they
travel to Barnton tomorrow.
If Royal High win the toss, they will almost certainly put the
Herioters in, and if the target set is substantial, they will batten
down the hatches to try to take something from the match. In other
words, a home victory is unlikely, so a draw becomes the aim of their
game.
Some have criticised the lower clubs for this negative approach but
they all suffer from limited player resources.
Grange meet Corstorphine, who are still in search of a win.
Watsonians, also anxious to strike a winning vein, are at Carlton in
what promises to be an intriguing contest, not least because of the
professional dimension represented by Robin Singh, who has already made
a big impact for the home side, and West Indian John Pollard, from whom
Watsonians anticipate pyrotechnics.
Stenhousemuir will be in more determined form for Falkland's visit,
while Edinburgh Accies are on dangerous territory at Freuchie.

First, at 8.30pm, there's a showing of Death And The Maiden, Roman
Polanski's version of Chilean dramatist Ariel Dorfman's play. It stars
Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver.
And at 11pm there's Ballroom Blitz, a dance-focused double-screening
which pairs the Australian hit movie Strictly Ballroom with BBC
Scotland's recent Ex-S telly profile of top sequinned twinkle-toes
Donnie Burns.
King Tut's meanwhile becomes KKKKKing Tut's. The extra consonants are
meant to indicate the kkkkkutting, kkkkkrunching nature of the hard
rockkkkk sounds on offer over the weekend in a veritable kkkkkornucopia
of the stuff. Tonight -- in a surprise change from the billing printed
in the official Mayfest brochure -- it's Riverdog, Incarnate and Auntie
Rose. Rockkkkk till you lose your sockkkkk, OKKKKK?
Late-night comedy at the Tron, starting at 10.30, is provided by
Scotland's very own Fred MacAulay as part of his Back Up From Down Under

COMPONENT Parts, a company comprising of writers Janet Paisley and
Graham McKenzie, set out with bold, very specific and potentially
intriguing goals: to ''set new writing and poetry in a dramatic context
. . . using theatre to present that writing in a focused, entertaining,
and accessible way''. For Want Of A Nail, their Mayfest offering, embeds
poetry by both new and established writers in a performance piece that
is in itself overtly poetic, clearly relishing verbal language and word
play.
The opening sequence leaves us in no doubt as to the terrain covered
by the play. Performers Paisley and McKenzie, as couple Frank and Cara,
mime a series of gunshot blows, wincing and sinking to the ground. They
move from a slow dance to a card game contested with some malice and
obvious pleasure in point scoring. All this to the accompanying
soundtrack of Let's Do It and bathed in blood red light. Love as a
dangerous game, a wounding contest, is the none-too-subtle metaphor.
The show attempts to elaborate on this theme, exposing the failures of
the spoken and written word to allow adequate communication.
Conversations run parallel, seldom inter-connecting. Streams of word
(DIS) association, misinterpretation, and fragmented soliloquy collage
and collide. We witness Frank and Cara slipping into even greater
isolation as they realise that their failure to communicate extends
beyond verbal language, into the realm of sexual desire.
While there are moments in the piece which strike cords of
uncomfortable recognition, it ultimately falls victim to its own
wordiness. The theatrical inexperience of the performers and a rather
self-consciously literate and laboured text, creates two characters who
fail to sustain audience interest and, perhaps more importantly,
sympathy.

LAST season wasn't one of the best at Whitehaugh. But, given the start
that Tilbury Phoenix Kelburne have made to the new term, things are
looking bright in that part of Paisley.
They managed to beat Kilmarnock last week, largely helped by new
professional, Roger Telemachus.
The 22-year-old was recommended by Omar Henry, and he has been
selected for the South African under-24 tour to Zimbabwe later in the
season.
Skipper Roddy Fergusson said: ''Roger is a good batsman, but we've
seen more of him as a bowler -- a quick bowler. He's fast enough to give
people a fright.'' And to take wickets, as he proved last weekend.
Also on Kelburne's books is 21-year-old Namibian, Dion Kotze, another
whose name was put forward by Henry.
''The thing is, for the rest of us to make the best of what they are
putting in,'' added Fergusson. ''Because if we are to do anything this
season, it has to be a team effort, rather than one or two doing all the
work.''
Tomorrow Kelburne visit West of Scotland, but the game of the day will
be at Glenpark, where Greenock, the 1993 winners, face Poloc.

WITH the last of the washing still being gathered in from the
Siegfried Line, and tired bluebirds not quite having the energy to skite
over the white cliffs of Dover 50 years on from the great day of
victory, the phrase comes to mind that ''a volunteer is worth 10 pressed
men.''
Ten individuals on the counties' scene are about to be pressed -- the
acting, unpaid heroes who mark every piece of action at weekend matches.
The scorers, the folk who record the ''dot balls'' -- that's when a
run is not scored off a delivery, for the uninitiated -- now must be on
the dot with their score sheets each week.
Ken Nisbet, statistics secretary of the Caley 80/- Scottish Counties
League explained: ''If the relevant scoring forms are not in by the
Thursday following a match, the club involved will be fined #10. If they
do it again, two points will be deducted from their score, and if they
offend a third time or more, five points will come off.''
Speaking of forms, Perthshire would like one in the shape of a work
permit signed by the district council to enable their former
professional, Lal Rajput, to return as soon as possible.
The men from the North Inch, so dominant in the 50s and 60s, but
bottom of the league last season, feel that they have a chance this year
to cause a few shock waves, but they need the Indian all-rounder to be
allowed to return.
But it is doubtful whether he will be available for tomorrow's visit
to Fifeshire at McKane Park.
Stirling County got off to a fine start against West Lothian, but
their trip to face Aberdeenshire will prove whether or not they can
mount a serious challenge this year.
The Wee County are hosts to Strathie at The Arns, while West Lothian
entertain Arbroath County at Boghall.

TRAMWAY'S semi-derelict workshop space has been exploited for the
Glasgow/Belgrade collaboration which is Nation, creating a stark setting
for a dark and ominous performance.
Utilising a brooding and relentless soundscape by John Cobban, a small
team of live bodies explore a brutalised landscape with single-minded
focus. Two males continually measure and define the ''territory'' while
a naked man with head bent painfully backwards and a solo female dancer
enact a slow choreography of victimisation and support. As a reaction to
time spent in ex-Yugoslavia, it evokes unsettling memories of the
endless brutality humans inflict on each other for racial gain and
power.
Its connections to Scotland are more tenuous and as a performance it
resorts to over-simplistic metaphors, which have been seen in many
industrial events throughout the eighties.
The themes of personal alienation, trauma, and stress repetition are
housed in a minimalist architectural framework, a huge slab containing a
shallow grave and two video screens while a pre-existing single pillar
is used as a ''home and prison'' for a tortured soul. Yet despite its
technical naivety, the company project a sincerity of purpose and for an
audience new to the rigours of such intense and emotive subject matter
it will be worth a visit to the show. It is a good sign that Tramway is
promoting new work again and will hopefully lead to more sustained
programming as the year progresses.

KATHRYN Marshall made light work of strong blustery winds with a fine
round of 69, three under par, over the Troia course in the American
Express Tour 54-holes Costa Azul Open in Portugal yesterday.
It left the Scot sharing the lead with Valerie Michaud, from France,
while over the Montado course, also par 72, Australians Corinne Dibnah
and Karrie Webb shared the lead at five under on 67.
''My goals this season are to collect as many Solheim Cup points as
possible and retain my card for the LPGA Tour in America,'' stated
Marshall.
Having been the reserve for last year's Solheim Cup match at The
Greenbrier in West Virginia has whetted Marshall's appetite. She has
played five weeks in America this year.
Troia is tree-lined, with penalties for missing the fairways. ''You
have to be straight off the tee and I did hit the ball well,'' added
Marshall.
After three birdies in a row from the ninth, she consolidated with her
fifth birdie after a No.9-iron to 10 feet for a 2 at the short
seventeenth.
Dibnah, a former British Open champion, warned that there are some
very good young Australians this year. She was quickly proved right when
Webb, 20, another Queenslander, handed in a matching 67, after six
birdies and an eagle. Leading scores (British &amp; Irish unless stated):
MONTADO
67 -- C Dibnah (Aus), K Webb (Aus).
68 -- E Orley (Swit).

ON THE eve of the Benson &amp; Hedges International Open, Colin
Montgomerie remarked: ''It's good to be back on a course where 72 means
something.'' In the first round yesterday, played in bleak, blustery,
and latterly wet weather, Montgomerie beat his own estimation of St
Mellion's challenge by all of five strokes.
However, within three strokes of Montgomerie lie three players who
have won the event over this course -- Paul Broadhurst, in 1993, sharing
second place on 68 with Richard Boxall, Steen Tinning, and Peter
O'Malley; Peter Senior, Broadhurst's predecessor, on 69; and Jose-Maria
Olazabal, the 1990 winner, on 70.
In a stronger breeze than confronted the later starters, Montgomerie
covered the first nine holes, his inward half, in 31. But in one
department of his game, Montgomerie was particularly confident. His
third set of the Callaway irons to which he changed allegiance from
Wilson last winter, have slightly more loft so that, contrary to the
aspirations of most golfers, he declared: ''The ball's not going as far,
which is a delight.''
Montgomerie needs no reminder of the potential for O'Malley to be his
nemesis again, for it was the Australian who in the 1990 Scottish Open
played the last seven holes in five under to beat him. But the plight of
Broadhurst over the past two years makes his challenging presence the
most noteworthy.
He plunged from nineteenth on the order of merit to No.131 last year
and is currently No.44, largely by dint of his joint-third place in
Milan last week which restored a flicker of life to his moribund career.
In matching Montgomerie's outward 31 Broadhurst holed a 50ft putt at
the first and a 45ft chip at the third. His score was an eloquent
response to setbacks. ''I've been through a lot of anxiety,'' he
confessed, ''and I was seriously worried at the start of the year that I
might not keep my card.''
Behind the vanguard, Scots Gordon Brand Jr, Sam Torrance, and Sandy
Lyle, all of whom won this tournament in the 1980s at Fulford, were
among those on 71.
Brand took encouragement from an improvement in his driving and from
holing a 40-yard pitch for an eagle 3 at the seventh, his sixteenth, but
Torrance missed four putts of less than four feet. Lyle, three under
without a bogey, had a double-bogey 6 at the last, as did Andrew
Coltart, a partner.
Lyle's only costly mistake began with a drive into a bunker and he
judged the round as one of his best here. Coltart hit his second shot
into the guarding pond, as did Stephen Gallacher, although he pitched
close for his bogey and finished only a stroke behind his uncle,
Bernard, the Ryder Cup captain.
Elsewhere, Adam Hunter's two bogeys in his last three holes for 72
left a sour taste, but the amateurs, Gallacher and Gordon Sherry, could
both take something positive from their respective 75 and 77. Gallacher
resolutely covered 16 holes in par after having started 6, 6 and Sherry
was the only player of 150 to make a birdie 3 at the last.

GLEN Day, the former European Tour player, emerged from a slump to
take the lead after the opening round at the Byron Nelson Classic in
Dallas, Texas, yesterday.
Day never looked back after birdies at the first two holes on his way
to seven-under-par 63 on the Cottonwood Valley course. He leads by one
stroke from fellow Americans Mark Calcavecchia and Jay Don Blake.
Calcavecchia, winner of last week's Atlanta Classic, also played at
Cottonwood Valley, while Blake was at the tougher Las Colinas TPC
course.
Nick Faldo is three strokes behind after a round of 66 that comprised
four birdies and 14 pars, while five-times Open champion Tom Watson and
John Daly shot 68.
Another Englishman, Stephen Keppler, third in the Atlanta Classic,
found it tougher going yesterday as he stumbled to a three-over 73.
Leading scores:
63 -- G Day. 64 -- J D Blake, M Calcavecchia. 65 -- N Ozaki (Japan), D
A Weibring, C DiMarco, R Freeman, K Perry, R Stewart (Canada), D Martin.
66 -- N Faldo (England).
Other scores included: 68 -- J Parnevik (Sweden). 72 -- D Feherty (N
Ireland). 73 -- S Keppler (England).

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with the rest of the world widened to
#1164m in February compared to January's #1107m.
Market projections had centred on around #1000m but the figures made
no impact on financial markets, preoccupied, anyway, with the rift
between the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England over
interest rates.
The value of exports rose 2[1/2]% over the month to #12bn, reflecting
higher exports to non-EU countries, while imports were up 2[1/2]% at
#13.1bn, this in turn reflecting higher imports from non-EU countries.
The latest estimates of trends in the value of trade shows little change
for exports but imports increasing.
In the three months to February, exports were unchanged and imports
increased by 6% to give a deficit of #3870m, the highest three-monthly
deficit for two years. The CSO says that this reflects broadly similar
changes in the deficits with EU and non-EU although the latter was
influenced by an erratically high deficit in December.
Overall, the latest estimate suggests that the trend in the whole
world visible deficit is widening.
In volume terms, after stripping out oil and erratic items, there was
little change in exports but imports rose by 1[1/2]%. On the same basis,
in the three months to February, the volume of exports fell by 4[1/2]%,
while imports were up by the same amount, with all the increase coming
from imports from the EU. The volume trend shows falling exports and
increasing imports.
Trade with non-EU countries -- which accounts for almost half of all
UK trade -- has been reasonably encouraging. The March figures, already
released, showed a deficit of #263m, down from #371m in February and
more in line with the trend seen last autumn before unusually large
sales of art distorted the last few months of 1994.
The visible balance with the EU countries was a deficit of #793m in
February against January's #815m but the gap has been widening with
lowest deficits being recorded during the summer months.
The UK's trade data is now considered to be on a deteriorating trend.
However, the figures are subject to revision, particularly the
invisibles from City services and overseas investment. Earnings from
invisibles could leave current account balance as a whole in the black.
Commenting on the export figures, Trade Minister Richard Needham said
that the last few months have shown a levelling off after a long series
of record figures but optimism remains high. He cited the recent CBI
quarterly trends survey which showed the confidence of exporters
reaching the highest levels seen since 1973.
''On a rolling three-month basis the deficit has increased from #3400m
to #3900m but I hope to see an improvement as the year goes on when
exporters' confidence and the growth in orders start to make themselves
felt in the real market place.''

LET'S push out the boat here. Glasgow has a feisty, spunky reputation
for theatre . . . it can take the tough, the rough, the earthy and the
intellectual. Here, in the first Scottish performance of Alfred
Schnittke's operatic allegory, Life with an Idiot, which opened last
night, is a brilliantly idiosyncratic work, straight out of the Theatre
of the Absurd, that, I suspect, would be appreciated by a theatre
audience as much and possibly more than an orthodox opera audience.
If you're not prepared, Schnittke's opera, in Jonathan Moore's wacky
production, appropriately garbed with David Blight's original designs --
one moment verismo, the next sublimely surrealistic -- will leave you
bewildered. The crucial points to understand are that the story -- an
apparently harmless lunatic is taken in by a couple and wreaks havoc,
unleashing the beast within themselves -- is cyclical, is being told in
flashback, and has a continually shifting perspective.
That is, one moment the husband will be in the thick of it, the next
speaking objectively to the audience; the chorus -- a huge role -- will
be in character, then voyeuristic, than functioning in Greek style.
Thus, even before the action erupts in the second act, there is a
feeling of inner pace to the tragedy-comedy-drama -- it's all of these
things. Obscenities and sexual violence flow torrentially, but they have
a wicked grotesquerie. (Not that that stopped the clumping of feet
walking out at points of the performance last night.)
The performances themselves, conducted by Richard Armstrong, have a
dramatic clarity not witnessed at the British premiere in London. They
still lack vocal clarity, however, almost making you wish for
supertitles, even though it is sung in English. That apart, the three
principals give dazzling accounts of their roles: Louisa
Kennedy-Richardson stratospheric as the wife, David Barrell a commanding
performance as the husband; and Alasdair Elliott -- what can we say?
Theatrically, vocally, and acrobatically, Elliott laps up the role,
subtle at first, ultimately devastating.
Strictly a one-off, this show. Interested in theatre? Make it a must.

SOME quartets seem to be led from the top, others from the bottom, but
with a viola player as articulate as Susan Harris, the other young
members of the Saltire Quartet were right to give her an opportunity
last night to show how effectively Ravel's string quartet can be led
from the middle.
Though a somewhat deliberate account of the first two movements had
displayed no general identification with the particular colouring and
character of the music, the sound of the viola began to assert itself
where it should have done -- in the shimmering sweetness of the slow
movement. This received a luminous, beautifully judged performance, and
the vigorous, grainy treatment of the finale sustained the emotional
momentum to the end.
With everybody but the cellist performing standing up, the members of
the Saltire do not make conspicuous eye contact. Body language is
apparently what counts, and it seemed to contribute to the alert,
rasping account of Stravinsky's three pieces for string quartet that
opened the programme.
There was plenty of rhythmic crunch, too, about the performance of
Beethoven's C minor quartet, Op 18, No 4, at the end. The dramatic
interplay between major and minor tonality was here scrupulously
defined, and the ambiguity of the closing bars greatly savoured.

ROTUND, grey-maned and phlegmy, Kevin Coyne looks and sounds like an
unholy union between Howlin' Wolf, Les Dawson, and Van Morrison. As he
ambled off last night on one of his growly, bluesy, free-form vocal
excursions, he resembled another Morrison, Jim of that ilk. Listening to
him, completely spellbound, you understood why the Doors' management
tentatively sounded Kevin Coyne out about joining the band in the
immediate aftermath of the Lizard King's untimely death, when Kevin was
at the peak of his fame.
Bog off, he probably told them in his flat Derbyshire tones. Kevin
Coyne can't be doing with rock-star flummery. He's got a sense of
humour, and he's too British, too rooted; too true to his art.
These things were tellingly revealed in Kevin's version of Bruce
Chanel's Hey Baby, which he transformed into a serio-comic narrative
encompassing rejection at the Derby Co-Op bacon-slicer in 1958 and
suburban living death 40 years later.
Kevin also sang movingly of old age and extreme cruelty, dead love
affairs, and lost women, and he played us glorious selections from his
forthcoming musical about the little-known, molar-free, post-war
Northern droll, Frank Randle. Kevin Coyne and Frank Randle: they're both
criminally-neglected and decidedly earthy genii.

Ross Finlay enjoys driving a vehicle with a lot of pull
LIKE many Japanese manufacturers, Isuzu started with its own-design
commercials and then moved into the car business by assembling under
licence a vehicle already familiar elsewhere. In Isuzu's case it was the
Hillman Minx. But the main outside influence in Isuzu today is General
Motors, which took a substantial shareholding in 1969, as a quick way
into Japan.
Isuzu cars started to be sold in the UK quite a while ago, but never
to the same extent as in some other European countries. The Finnish
importers, for instance, made plenty of advertising capital, and sales,
out of the fact that Pentti Airikkala's rally career began in an Isuzu
Bellet. Latterly, in this country, there was only the Isuzu Piazza Turbo
developed by Lotus, but sales were pretty low.
When the UK concession was taken over by I.M. Group, it eventually
decided to concentrate on Isuzu's 4x4 Trooper range. Late in 1993, when
moves within the GM empire meant that Trooper sales here were to be
transferred to Vauxhall, there was one of the most furious rows the
British motor industry has seen for years. A settlement was finally
arrived at, so that the import quota of Isuzu-built 4x4s would be shared
between the existing Trooper and Monterey, with the I.M. Group's
involvement gradually tapering off.
However, it is still busily selling its ration of Troopers, as
vehicles which incline more to the ''working'' side of the 4x4 market
than acting as lifestyle accessories. I have been driving one of the
stubby workhorses of the range, a short wheelbase Duty fitted with the
3.1-litre turbo diesel engine.
This version costs #18,648 -- petrol and turbo diesel variants of each
model are identically priced. Peak power output is 113 bhp but, as
usual, it is the torque which is more important in a vehicle like this.
The Trooper turbo diesel reaches 192lb ft of torque, exactly the same as
the V6 petrol option, but at 2000rpm rather than 3750rpm, which is the
diesel's great advantage when it comes to low and mid-range pull.
Accelerating to 60mph takes about 16 seconds, and this Trooper has a
flat-out test track speed in the low 90s. The likely fuel consumption
figures of 28mpg at 56mph, 18 at 75 and 21mpg when pottering around town
are pretty eye-watering, but they are better overall than the V6 petrol
version manages.
Showing that it is meant to be worked, the Duty has a fair supply of
passenger grab handles. There is a fine commanding driving position, a
curious variety of switchgear is fitted, and the instrument panel in the
old-fashioned fascia is well stocked for the type and price of 4x4.
Visibility to the front is excellent. The rear door-mounted spare wheel
is low enough not to get seriously in the way, but the big C-pillar
makes taking an over-the-left-shoulder glance quite tricky.
On the road, the turbo diesel pulls like a steam train. As is to be
expected, its mid-range acceleration is more impressive than its
off-the-line performance. The SWB version can be manoeuvred quite
easily, although it does react more to wind gusts at motorway speeds
than the longer five-door probably does. Off-road the Trooper has the
usual transfer box with high and low ratios, and its freewheeling hubs
can be simply locked and unlocked on the move.
This particular version is more often used as a tow vehicle than as a
mud-plugger, although I know someone who has very specialised towing
requirements and reckons the current softer-outlined Troopers are not
quite as good at the job as the pre-1992 design. However, after I handed
back the test car, I happened to call in at a pony club meeting. The
first vehicle I saw in the car park, towing away a horsebox, was a
Trooper identical to the one I had been using. The expression ''horses
for courses'' sprang to mind.

THE US oil majors have signalled a trend in the industry which is
being followed by UK companies namely a deterioration in refining offset
by a further recovery in chemicals.
This was apparent in the first-quarter results which showed net income
up 36% on the comparable period of 1994 at #1273m.
However, it was not up by as much relative to the fourth quarter of
1994. The quarter included a special credit of #44m.
Exploration and production earnings increased considerably, up 41% to
#599m, due to higher oil prices and higher net equity crude oil
production.
The spot price for Brent Blend, the marker for North Sea crudes,
averaged $16.90 a barrel compared with $16.55 a barrel in the previous
quarter and only $13.95 a barrel in the first quarter of 1994.
Weather-related disruptions to North Sea production helped boost oil
prices together with US demand to replenish oil stocks in anticipation
of the seasonal increase in gasoline demand.
Depressed growth in oil demand in Europe and North America due to the
mild winter had an adverse impact on refining margins. This was apparent
in all major markets and has continued into the second quarter.
By contrast there was a very healthy performance from chemicals
offsetting what some viewed as a disappointing fourth quarter. The
improvement reflected the stronger petrochemicals market and a better
competitive position. Earnings excluding special items were #360m
compared with just #56m previously.
There was an improved performance both inside and outside the US.
Elsewhere in the group, coal earnings of #3m reflected improved sales
volumes. The remaining mining activities in the group are currently
being sold.
Cash flow from operating activities was #1800m, compared with #2200m
in the first quarter of 1994. Capital expenditure and exploration
expense was #1500m compared with #1300m in the first quarter of 1994.
At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term
securities amounted to #8300m. Total debt was #7000m equivalent to a
modest gearing ratio, particularly for a company the size of Shell, of
15.4%.
Oil analysts at brokers Kleinwort Benson expect second-quarter
earnings to show an underlying improvement because of higher oil prices
and improved refining margins in the US and to a lesser extent Europe,
although there may be a deterioration in the second half of the year.
The chemicals operation should get some further benefit from the
strong German mark and the weak dollar although there are already signs
that prices may have levelled out which is perhaps not surprising given
their surge late last year.
Shell shares gained 3p to 767p. However, Kleinwort's continues to
believe that BP looks better value than Shell in that it stands on a
lower multiple and on a size-for-size basis, should see better surplus
cash-flow generation.

RECOVERY in North America brought a trebling in first-quarter profits
for Royal Insurance but the UK contribution was lower as rates came
under pressure.
The group total came to #96m though premium income was only marginally
higher at #1137m. The UK was the powerhouse last year but it has
definitely peaked, with the contribution from UK general insurance #3m
lower at #58m.
Claims frequency was lower but Royal reckons adverse weather cost #6m
and it also spent #6m on an advertising campaign.
Motor has become more competitive with the expansion of the direct
insurers and rates have fallen some 6%, though Royal chief executive
Richard Gamble now sees signs of stabilisation. This is also the case
for household cover, where rates have come back 4%-6%.
With insurers now more able to price cover more accurately, Mr Gamble
considers that the downturn in rates will be much more limited than it
was five years ago.
Royal's own direct arm took on 15% more motor policies, making
345,000, out of the 1,000,000 cars it insures.
America saw recovery from losses of #37m to profits of #15m, on the
back of much lower weather losses of #7m against #48m. Royal said there
is an underlying improvement in performance, with more customers
renewing policies and the selective acquisition of new business. Canada
improved for similar reasons.
Royal continues to nibble away at its costs in the UK as more
information technology comes on stream. Its three-year programme to
reduce its 12,000 UK workforce by 10% is on target. In the first quarter
some 100 jobs have gone in the life division and 200 in the estate
agencies, which lost a same-again #5m. Against this it supplies 20% of
regular premium life business.
Despite the problems in the sector, UK life profits were maintained,
with the worldwide result showing some improvement.
It is early days yet but full-year profits of around #450m are looked
for, up from #401m.

SOMEWHERE, in the closet recesses of our imagination -- nestling in a
box labelled ''comfort shoes -- dreams for the wearing in'' -- we all
have a pair of ruby slippers. They get us to whatever Emerald City we
seek in our dreams, and they get us home to whatever Kansas we actually
belong in. We slip them on when times are grim, and the best place to be
is over the rainbow.
The Handsome Foundation understand all this totally. They also
understand why this fantasy and the frocks, the spangled dreams, the
absolutely fabulous divas are so talismanic within gay culture. As part
of the preparation for this current show, Legend, the group met with
people who are HIV positive or living with Aids. They listened -- and
then they translated the conversations, the insecurities, yearnings,
memories, and resolution into a piece that searches out our deepest
fears and our bravest faces. Often -- like the cowardly Lion -- we're
braver than we know. The trick is in believing . . . the magic isn't
necessarily fantasy.
Legend is deliciously funny, wistful, clever, and often poetic. It
twines classic iconography from stage and screen into monologues that
reveal how this imagery figures inside the heads, and lives, of ordinary
people. One glorious sequence has three individuals saying what they
remember about The Wizard of Oz. Their descriptions are, at times,
hilariously wide of the mark -- but it's their view, their ''use'' of
it, that counts.
Elsewhere, the cast of four explore the nightmare realms of loneliness
and vulnerability, of love lost and trust betrayed -- all the things
that leave you feeling that growing up should really carry a government
health warning. Performances all round are simply ace.

A DECISION by the Sainsbury supermarket group to open in-store
butchery counters selling traditional Scotch beef could provide a major
boost for Scottish producers.
As part of their response to an anticipated increase in demand the
Anglo Beef Producers' plant in Bathgate has launched a campaign to sign
up more members for its Partnership in Livestock procurement group --
sourcing beef and lamb direct from farm-assured producers.
ABP chose Ayr show last week as the launch-pad for their campaign to
recruit more Scottish farmers as suppliers of Sainsbury's Tenderlean
Lamb and Sainsbury's Traditional Beef.
The Scottish Office is supporting the initiative with a #148,000 grant
over three years under a marketing development scheme. The company,
which also exports to Europe from its Bathgate plant, will be investing
a similar amount.
John Connolly, general manager of ABP Scotland, said he would be
looking for up to 600 cattle a week and between 3000 and 8000 lambs,
depending on season -- all under the farm-assured banner. Most of the
output from Bathgate would go to Sainsbury's for whom ABP is one of the
biggest suppliers of beef and lamb, he said.
The partnership group currently has 450 members but it is hoping to
double that number, drawing from the high-quality end of the production
chain.
A mobile display unit, on show for the first time at Ayr, will make
the rounds of 10 major shows in Scotland this summer. Mr Connolly said
that he was anxious to achieve a broad geographic spread of producers to
ensure continuity of supply throughout the year -- especially for lamb
which was a major part of ABP's Scottish business.
ABP claims that by selling directly to them farmers can save marketing
costs of up to #20 for cattle and #1.50p for a lamb.
* MEANWHILE the Meat &amp; Livestock Commission is blaming lower demand
for lamb in France over the last few weeks as the main reason behind
weaker-than-anticipated spring lamb prices.
The number of new season lambs coming forward has risen markedly since
the beginning of April but throughputs at MLC sample markets remain 12%
down compared to last year's figures.
Prices are 17.5p lower, at an average of 141.36p a kg for the month of
April.
With less demand for export, more lambs are remaining on the British
market and depressing prices. In addition, lamb is being traded on the
French market at lower prices than might be otherwise expected. French
consumers are reportedly resisting higher prices in the light of
competition from cheaper poultry meat and competitively priced pig meat.
The current weakness of sterling is, to some extent, helping exporters
to compete in Continental markets. In terms of the French franc some
lamb prices are 18% down on last year but if the comparison is made in
sterling the fall is only 9%.
French lamb production traditionally peaks in March and April.
Normally a proportion of French lambs is exported live to Spain but the
substantial devaluation of the peseta is making trading difficult,
leaving more lambs on the French market. The weakness of the lira has
had a similar effect on lamb trade with Italy.
A further factor affecting the overall lamb trade is the high number
of hoggets coming to market. April figures were 40% up on last year. The
commission suggests that the slowdown in the number of spring lambs
coming on to the market will help stem the price decline in coming
weeks.

FOR the first time since 1990, the UK chemical industry is planning to
increase its capital spending on new plant and equipment. The forecast
figure for 1995 is #2065m, an increase of 6.2% in real terms on 1994,
writes NICOLA REEVES.
The 30th annual Investment Intentions Survey published by the Chemical
Industries Association (CIA) shows that companies are forecasting even
higher expenditure for 1996 and 1997 as UK economic growth continues to
exceed that of its European counterparts and profit margins recover.
There has been a welcome recovery in the petrochemicals industry with
capacity utilisation, prices and returns all improving.
Throughout much of the 1980s and early 1990s the highest spending area
of Britain on a geographic basis has been South-east England and East
Anglia reflecting the strong presence of the pharmaceutical and
speciality chemicals industries in these areas.
However, in 1995-97 the distribution of capital spending is expected
to shift northwards to the basic heavy end of the chemical industry.
Scotland is expected to account for 15%, up 1% on 1994.
Although capital spending is expected to increase, companies are
cautious and do not want to repeat the mistakes of past economic upturns
which resulted in overcapacity. Much of the new investment is going on
new products and measures aimed at increased efficiency and thereby
international competitiveness.
Surprisingly expenditure on environmental protection, having been on a
rising trend, fell back for the second succesive year. However, the
British chemical industry is still spending more than the US.
An area of concern cited by survey respondents, especially smaller
companies, was the importance of reinstating 100% first-year capital
allowances for plant and machinery to help improve the attractiveness of
investment in the UK.
The UK chemical industry is Britain's fourth-largest manufacturing
industry and one of its biggest exporters. As such the CIA is concerned
to see Britain's political establishment adopting a positive and
constructive role within the European Union, thereby guaranteeing that
the UK remains an attractive option for overseas investors.

SCOTTISH Pride has announced the completion of a #200,000 development
at their Mauchline Creamery in Ayrshire which will give them a new
facility for the pre-packing of cheese. This project represents the
first phase of a major investment programme planned for Mauchline.
The new pre-packing line is claimed to be the only one of its kind in
Scotland with the capacity and flexibility to meet the demands of all
market outlets. It will play an important role in the company's plans to
place a renewed emphasis on the branding of their island cheeses from
Rothesay and Arran.
Adam McCartney, director of cheese manufacturing and sales, said: ''We
now have a unique opportunity to develop a range of Scottish Island
cheeses with variety and characteristics to appeal to the widest
markets.''
The official opening of the new line was carried out by Scottish Pride
chairman Lord Sanderson (right) who was presented with a sample of
pre-packed cheddar, destined for a supermarket customer, by chief
executive Jim Hosea.

SIX-AND-A-HALF years ago, 270 people lost their lives in and above the
town of Lockerbie in one of the most appalling terrorist atrocities ever
perpetrated. On May 11, Channel 4 plans to broadcast The Maltese Double
Cross, a Libyan-financed film that purports to be a documentary about
the bombing.
If the broadcast version resembles the original, it will assert that
Iran, Palestine terrorists, Syrian drug dealers, and officials of the US
Government were involved in the plot -- in other words, anyone but
Libya.
The US Government, like that of the UK, remains determined to bring to
justice all those responsible for the bombing. The investigation remains
open and we will follow the evidentiary trail wherever it may lead. We
have enough evidence to bring two Libyan suspects to trial. The UN
Security Council has endorsed our demand that the suspects be
surrendered to judicial authorities in Scotland or the US.
If the Libyans are surrendered, they will be accorded the full rights
of suspects under our respective laws. For that reason, I am not at
liberty to discuss the factual errors in the film as this could be cited
as prejudicial to any subsequent trial. For the same reason, no current
US Government official will appear in the panel discussion after the
broadcast.
However, in judging the film's claims, viewers may wish to consider
the primary ''expert'' sources on which its theories rely: Juval Aviv,
Lester Coleman, and Oswald Le Winter.
Juval Aviv has claimed to have led a Mossad ''hit squad'' that
assassinated Arab terrorists in revenge for the massacre of Israeli
athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Official records, however, show
that he was a ''junior security officer'' at the El Al Airline office in
New York at the time and was later fired for being ''unreliable and
dishonest.''
The Israeli Government has confirmed that Aviv never worked for its
intelligence services and noted his involvement in''various acts of
fraud and impersonation''. Aviv was recently arrested in the US for
defrauding an American company.
The film's second main ''expert'' is Lester Coleman, a former
low-level informant for the US Drug Administration and Defense
Intelligence Agency who was fired by both organisations for separate
instances of theft and improper conduct. Coleman has bragged to
journalists that he ''invented'' his claim to have recognised a
passenger on Pan Am 103 as a drug courier. He is currently a fugitive
from justice, wanted in the US for perjury related to the Lockerbie case
and for passport fraud.
The film's third main source is Oswald Le Winter, who admits to having
used at least 18 different aliases at one time or another. In The
Maltese Double-Cross Le Winter claims to have spent 17 years in the CIA.
In fact, he has never been employed by the agency in any capacity.
Le Winter was convicted in 1953 for impersonating a US Marine Corps
officer. When arrested in London in 1971 for extortion (a charge for
which he was later acquitted in an English court), he had in his
possession a fake New York City police badge and what purported to be
diplomatic credentials from the Knights of Malta as Ambassador to the
United Nations. In 1985 he was convicted of trafficking in drug
precursor chemicals.
He later became deeply involved in the ''October Surprise'' conspiacy
theory, which claimed that the 1980 Reagan presidential campaign had
persuaded Iran not to release American hostages until after the
election. Le Winter finally admitted under oath that he had fabricated
the story in prison, in order to gain revenge on the Government.
It is is easy to understand why Libyan leaders would want to help
finance a film that seeks to absolve their agents of responsibility for
the Lockerbie atrocity. But if they really want to challenge the
evidence developed by the Pan Am 103 investigation and to end sanctions
with the United Nations imposed on them, they should turn the indicted
suspects over to Scottish or American authorities for trial.
That -- not blatant propaganda -- is the way to resolve any questions
about responsibility for this senseless tragedy.

THERE is a struggle under way in the West of Scotland between estate
agents, a handful of which had dominated the second-hand home sales
market for 20 years, and member firms of the Glasgow Solicitors'
Property Centre, which remain committed to improving the lot for both
sellers and buyers alike.
Each of the 400-plus solicitors who belong to GSPC, as well as every
estate agent with whom we compete, has a vested interest in the outcome
of this struggle.
As individual solicitors, pooling our resources to launch an
effective, highly competitive, and financially independent, centralised
property display and marketing organisation made sound common sense.
Taking the very best from solicitors' property centres around Scotland,
we are succeeding. Increasing numbers are turning to us for help when it
comes to buying and selling a home.
It's hardly surprising that not everyone welcomes such success. We
aimed to take business away from estate agents, and that's precisely
what we're continuing to do. In just 18 months, our share of the Glasgow
market has increased fivefold to 25%. Our gain is the estate agents'
loss.
The struggle to which I've referred will run and run. We've made
dramatic inroads into the market to date, yet its steady and sustainable
progress we're confidently predicting.
Every nuance associated with this struggle may be of interest to the
players involved, but surely not to their respective clients.
Stewart McIntosh's piece quoting John Hinshelwood, of one major estate
agency, could be interpreted as just the latest example of the cart
leading the horse. Hinshelwood is quoted levelling criticism at our
Weekly List, our rate of sale, and our ''dismal and alarmist'' report on
average prices. But what else can he say? After all, the future of his
business is solely dependent upon sales whereas, self-evidently, the
GSPC and its members have a much longer time horizon and a wider,
holistic approach to their clients' best interests.
As for average prices, is Hinshelwood also taking issue with Britain's
largest building society, the Halifax? Its results, like ours, too,
point to a Scotland-wide price dip of around the same percentage. We're
confident that interest at the bottom end of the market, where prices
and volume are up on last year, is a good sign for the market as a
whole. We do not, however, feel the need to talk up our figures.
We'll continue to tell it how it is, and people will listen because we
can now justly claim to be Glasgow's biggest single property marketing
organisation, a major league player.
At issue is not the struggle between GSPC and estate agents per se, in
any event, not as far as home buyers and sellers are concerned, but
those factors which differentiate our approach with respect to that of
our competition and, crucially, the results we deliver. And we know
we're delivering a better deal.

MY first impression on reading Gerry McSherry's article (May 9) on the
1918 Education (Scotland) Act was that we had heard all this before.
Indeed we have, but not with quite so many misunderstandings as
displayed here.
As one who attended both Catholic and Protestant schools in my youth,
and has recently served on a Catholic school board, I believe I speak
with a little experience of the matter.
I was quite unaware of the disparaging rhymes related in the article,
which prompts me to ask: what kind of school did Mr McSherry attend? I
have never talked about going to ''chapel'' but always of going to
''church''. There is a difference between the two words, but it has
nothing to do with one's faith. There is no question of Catholic parents
being threatened with ''eternal damnation'' for failing to have their
children attend a Catholic school.
To suggest that the raison d'etre of the Catholic hierarchy is the
retention of the Act is merely laughable.
Mr McSherry asks where parental choice comes in. Well, parental choice
for Catholic parents is almost defeated today by the numbers of
Protestant parents trying to enrol their children at Catholic schools,
and I have personal experience of this.
Perhaps Mr McSherry should ask why this is the case. Could it be that
in our amoral society of today, many parents, of whatever denomination,
expect Catholic schools to be a better environment in which their
children may mature?
Finally, I do not go to Celtic Park, but I have a Catholic nephew who
regularly goes to Ibrox. What does any of this prove? To me it suggests
that we are not all born the same. Some of us believe one thing, some
another. The important thing is to love all men, regardless of their
beliefs.
I do not know who or what Mr McSherry is, but perhaps he could start
to heal the hatred he seems to perceive, by trying to love those who
have devoted their lives to the service of others.

GERRY McSHERRY demonstrates perfectly the hypocrisy of those who
countenance the Humanist dream (May 9).
Having indignantly bemoaned the inhuman treatment meted out to the
Scottish Roman Catholic minority in the nineteenth and early twentieth
century, he goes on to refer to the Catholic clergy as ''they who have
no children''.
This kind of remark, together with the historical illiteracy of the
average Humanist, will go far in convincing people of their peace-loving
motives.
The Celtic and Rangers mentality that Gerry McSherry accused the
Catholic Church of fostering by clinging to the 1918 Education Act could
not be further from the truth. It is a fact that this form of bigotry is
nurtured in the homes of those who have abandoned religion.
The Church has a duty before God to instruct Catholic children in the
true faith for the salvation of their souls. This necessarily involves
separate schooling to protect them from erroneous opinions.
Sadly, however, there are many in the Church today who favour Gerry
McSherry's theory of unity in diversity (Ecumenism), the end result of
which is pure Humanism.

March 24
MR Andy Arnold, of the Arches Theatre Company, calls and asks me to
appear in the company's revival of their hugely successful production of
The Crucible, running for two weeks in Mayfest. He casually mentions
that they would also be staging three short Chekhov comedies and that
members of The Crucible cast who did not appear in Act Two could be in
the third Chekhov, The Wedding. I do appear in Act Two but not for 25
minutes and Mr Arnold assures me that he has it all worked out. Like a
fool, I believe him.
Appearing in two plays in the one evening is no great feat, but
appearing in two simultaneously requires organisation, preparation, and
careful timing; in the absence of these however, I trust to luck and
assume it will turn out all right, somehow.
April 12
CHEKHOV rehearsals begin. All that is required of me in The Wedding is
to play an ancient drunken waiter, so I decided to apply Stanislavski's
well-known dictum: ''When having no lines in Chekhov, bring on the
rubber chicken.''
I never expected that my first experience of performing Chekhov would
be as a doddering, grotesque purveyor of comedy comestibles, but then I
don't imagine Chekhov imagined that he would one day be performed in the
style of a Carry On film. However, when we open, the rubber chicken,
quivering comedy gherkins and amusingly large pineapple all get huge
laughs, which surely is the point and purpose of comedy.
April 21
REHEARSALS continue piecemeal, half Crucible, half Chekhov, with
confusion between the two only barely avoided. One Sunday, we are
rehearsing The Crucible in the 7:84 building, only to find that they
neglected to give us the keys to the rehearsal room itself, and that
they have all gone to Perth. We rise above it by going to the pub.
May 1
THE Chekhov opens to a full house and an excellent reception. All goes
well until the third night, when Miss Louise Ludgate contracts
laryngitis and loses her voice, requiring the show to be rejigged
somewhat. We rise above it by going to the Mayfest Club.
Meanwhile, we rehearse The Crucible during the day and I worry more
and more about leaving The Wedding in time to change and get onstage for
Act Two. The theatre is rarely a place where the expected can actually
be expected, and as the opening night looms into view, I feel every
liquid component of my body freeze with a sense of impending dread. I
know it's not a matter of life and death, but when you are onstage in
front of 150 people and the actor whose entrance is expected is nowhere
in sight death seems like a quick and merciful release.
I recall Mr Arnold facing that very predicament while performing in
The Erpingham Camp and resorting to the unorthodox solution of singing
Edelweiss to the audience, but while this just about passes muster in
Joe Orton, it is not generally recommended for Arthur Miller.
May 8
OPENING night. We gloomily convene in the Arches during the day and
spend hours waiting for technical problems to be overcome. We discuss
food chains among pond life, and Mr George Docherty accuses Mr Noddy
Davidson and me of being ''mammal snobs''. Mr Joel Strachan brings up
the subject of cockroach brain transplants. The long day wears on.
We open to a full house, and all things go well until an almighty
crash is heard 10 minutes into Act One. This Act revolves around Miss
Jessica Rundle lying comatose on a table in the centre of the stage; I
walk on to find that the table has collapsed and she is now on the floor
with a pile of broken debris under her. Fortunately, she is unharmed,
and this magnificent cast rose above it with consummate ease, but I
confess it left me far from sanguine.
Off, change, and run to the Chekhov backstage, only to find I have
another seven minutes until The Wedding begins. This means I now have
less time onstage than I thought, and indeed, I barely managed 10
minutes of gratuitous buffoonery before I get the signal from Mr Noddy
and have to run back through to The Crucible, remembering to change
character as I go. I manage it in time, which makes a poor anecdote but
a welcome relief.
After the show Mr Arnold pops the cork off his traditional first night
tonic wine and toasts his battle-weary troops. Miraculously, the man
with the Midas touch has pulled off another coup de theatre.

I WAS not aware that this is ME Awareness Week until I read Alan
Watters's moving article (May 11). The tragedy is that sceptics will not
take the trouble to enlighten themselves by reading articles like this.
Alan Watters highlights the very common phenomenon of the individual
with ME who has fostered spiritual growth as a response to the trials of
his illness. He is one representative of many.
While this is very laudable in the sufferer himself, it is a sad
reflection on the society in which we live. People are forced to raise
their eyes to the hills as the world at large has little understanding
to offer them. Ironically, I think it is the unsympathetic who should be
asking a few questions of themselves.
Mr Watters is to be much admired for his thoughtful and positive
approach.

Hope that most ME can be cured
I WOULD like to congratulate Alan Watters on his excellent article on
ME (May 11). What he wrote was so typical of the experience of people
who have lived through ME -- like myself and others -- that not only
does the article encourage the belief that this condition does actually
exist but it also offers the hope that in most cases it can be cured.
Like Alan Watters I too found that it was very helpful to have ''a
very sympathetic and knowledgeable doctor who has a great interest in
the illness,'' and that consequences such as the ''breakdown of
friendships'' are not insurmountable given time and positive thinking.
ME Awareness Week can do nothing but good, and my colleague Jimmy
Hood, MP for Clydesdale, and others who have done such sterling work on
the subject -- including demanding appropriate research -- deserve, in
and out of Parliament, the utmost support for their activities.

YOU want a flash performer? Someone who epitomizes their art with just
one casual, but essentially complicated gesture? Jazz might be where to
look. One sax-man playing two saxes simultaneously perhaps, or
boogie-woogie piano pounded while taking a headstand.
But how's this? A DJ stripping down the beats with his nose. Not to
create a stir, but simply because he can. This is Andy. Better known as
A-One. DJ with Freshly Squeezed, demonstrating what a DJ does in a hip
hop band.
''Freshly Squeezed's hip hop element has come from two turntables and
two copies of the same tune,'' he says. He picks out the beat on one
copy, spins it back scratching the beat backwards, fades over to the
other copy, picks out the same beat, spins and returns.
That's just the basic bit. A new rhythm created from two pieces of
vinyl. A rhythm over which Andy has complete control, both in pitch and
in tempo. Then add real drums, double bass, guitar, saxophones, and
rapper.
The Freshly Squeezed sound is cool hip hop beats over funky,
hard-driving double bass. The swirl of rhythm guitar and scatter of
high-hat. Manic sax solos; mellow breaks. It's a sound equally at home
at sternum-wobbling volume in a club or -- as will happen tonight -- in
more laidback form at Edinburgh's Queen's Hall, co-supporting trumpeter
Byron Wallen's Sound Advice quintet with Edinburgh duo Blackanized
360[DEG].
''We're steering our set towards the Queen's Hall gig,'' says
guitarist Dave. ''We're crossing the jazz feel, which we all love, and
the hip hop feel with its beats and stuff. Obviously, the rapping keeps
it all together.''
Rapper James looks nonplussed. ''I'm trying to be positive, talking
about everyday things,'' he says. ''Some of my words are quite political
but be positive, that's my message.''
It's not a message you'll always catch, however. James has so much to
say, so many words to fit into each line, that sometimes you can feel
their effect only through their rhythm. Tight packets of vocabulary that
dance across the steady beat of drum and bass.
''We want to make the most of everything available,'' says Dave.
''From electronic sounds; from stuff on vinyl; from what you can do with
an instrument. We want to take the widest possible parameters.''
So while Andy provides a rhythmic element, he also provides an ambient
complement to the music. A smattering of ironic applause after a
particularly wild solo. A rock guitar riff. If it's there on vinyl, it
can be there live.
''It's the musical equivalent of William Burroughs' cut-up writing
style,'' says drummer Andy. A fair comparison, only the Freshly Squeezed
sound does not have that abstract randomness. No. It's solid, tuneful,
and uplifting jazz. What the unconventional presentation does do,
however, is ensure that Freshly Squeezed will remain ahead of the game
by more than a nose.

David Belcher charts the progress of a young label dealing in blasts
of good music
IF they continue as explosively as they've begun, the two Creeping
Bent laddies will soon have to change the name of their record label to
Racing Straight, or Unbending Thrust. Why? Because when it comes to the
creation of choice singles, unbending Scottish thrusters Douglas
MacIntyre and Stephen Lironi are racing straight into a position of
worldwide influence.
Born in Glasgow fewer than six months ago, the label has newly
released two neat waxings, Spacehopper's Milkmetal EP and Burning by the
Leopards. Both bands will be in Mayfest action a week on Saturday at
King Tut's alongside label-mates the Secret Goldfish, whose own debut
single, Seasick, appears next month.
But it's the nebulous fourth band on the Creeping Bent roster, the
Revolutionary Corps of Teenage Jesus, who have provided the label with
their global connections, as Stephen Lironi explains. ''It's best to
describe the Revolutionaries as a studio-based, multi-media,
free-floating visual exercise,'' Stephen says, adding that their
re-working of Suicide's Frankie Teardrop will emerge in July.
I interrupt, saying that when I saw RCTJ in action at the Tramway they
were two giggly, embarrassed-looking 15-year-old girls hitting keyboards
apparently at random. Stephen agrees, before revealing that both girls
have now been sacked, leaving the random keyboard-hitting solely to him.
''Douglas and I plucked the girls off the street -- or out of Boots to
be exact -- and played them a few Suicide tracks. They said the tunes
sounded nearly as good as Boyzone. But in the end both girls had to go.
They wouldn't take orders. Wouldn't smile. Wouldn't stop looking glum.''
In contrast, being a Revolutionary has had Stephen looking anything
but glum. You see, RCTJ's manipulation of Suicide's original tune had to
be approved by Suicide's New York-based ex-manager, Marty Thau. Stephen
sent a tape off for approval.
Marty phoned back immediately and said he loved it. Suicide frontman
Alan Vega loved it, too. So much so that Stephen is currently engaged in
creating a new album for Alan Vega, dispatching daily instrumental
tracks from his London home-studio across the Atlantic for Mr Vega's
perusal.
''It's in the spirit of the first Suicide album, a record which has
always inspired Douglas and I. Among the things we like about it is the
fact that it's the opposite of career rock. It's obviously a work of
genuine emotional catharsis for Alan Vega and his then-partner, Marty
Rev. Something they had to get out of their systems, and once done, it
was impossible for them to repeat.
''It's the sound of Elvis Presley as he lay dying on his bathroom
floor in Gracelands, catching one last sight of himself in the mirror.''
Not unnaturally, such talk leads us into Stephen's recent production
work for Black Grape, the band led by former head-Happy Monday, Shaun
Ryder. In the messy wake of the Mondays' unhappy demise, many a
heartless pundit had tipped Shaun for a
rock-casualty-mortal-coil-shuffling-off scenario. Stephen will not be
drawn on their time in the studio together.
''Black Grape's first album is called It's Great When You're Straight,
and the title says all there is to say. Shaun's not as straight as most
people, but much straighter than he used to be.''
Aye, a funny old game, pop. ''It's a ridiculous way to earn a living,
I agree. Sitting within four walls, twiddling noises on to bits of
plastic. And playing live is worse than being in a circus. Terrible
sound. No control. Hanging around, being bored for hours. The only
instrument I play live these days is the beer bottle
.
.
. at the bar.
''And the music industry and its machinations; its inability to grasp
irony and ideas. When we were young and daft, in the late eighties,
Douglas and I were in Flesh who were signed to a major label. We once
said, in a tongue-in-cheek way, that we wanted to be the next Pointer
Sisters
.
.
. and so we ended up being locked in a studio with the people who'd
written Jump, which wasn't any use to anybody.
''And the major-label measure of success is an odd one. At Creeping
Bent we don't measure success in terms of the volume of records sold.
The major companies can afford to throw money at their acts for years
with no sales in return
.
.
. they make more money out of car-parking than records. Our goals are
to make people be aware we exist, and to keep putting out records we
like.''
Missions accomplished on these front. Creeping Bent: undeviating
blasts of good music.

Creeping Bent's avant-punk showcase and no-wave disco, featuring
Spacehopper, the Leopards, the Secret Goldfish, and famed Radio Forth
disc-spinner DJ Duke; King Tut's, May 20, 8pm.

MAY I compliment you on your leading article concerning the proposed
alalgamation of Scottish Nuclear with the English Nuclear Electric
Company (May 10)?
Ian Lang's self-congratulatory explanation of the plan was, however,
in my opinion, a pretty abysmal cover-up of his very apparent failure,
once again, to do the right thing for Scotland.
He is certain now to go down in history as the Secretary of State for
Scotland -- and hopefully the last one -- who helped to sell off most of
our country's basic industries for nothing more than the fulfilment of
part of the ideology of the Conservative Party.
As someone who had the privilege in the 1960s of serving as a part
time member of the former South of Scotland Electricity Board, I must
also say how sad it is that all the pioneering, planning, and other good
work done by its managers, staff, and other employees -- especially in
the difficult early post-war years -- to develop the electricity
industry as a public service, is now being further eroded and wasted.

It is a sad and confusing day
when a cycling campaign objects to the design of a new cycle path (May
10). But the press release issued by the Glasgow Cycling Campaign simply
compared the design of the Loch Lomond extension with standards set by
the European Federation for Transport and the Environment, a leading
organisation in this field.
Their document, Greening Urban Transport, has three key points. First,
do not mix cyclists with pedestrians; secondly, do not create cycle
paths on pavements; thirdly, do not create conflict with motor vehicles.
These problems are all manifest on the proposed path, hence the reason
for the Glasgow Cycling Campaign's concern. The solution is to create
dedicated cycle lanes that separate cyclists from pedestrians and cars.
They may be more expensive, but they promote safe, fast and convenient
cycling -- precisely what the market demands, and precisely what
Councillor Gordon, Chair of Roads in Strathclyde, highlighted during his
speech on the day.
Our demonstration was not well received, but it is better that we
endure a heated exchange now so that in the long run all cyclists enjoy
a safe, high quality system.

Vice Convener,

I MUST admit I'm quite looking forward to a little assignment which
the BBC has kindly provided, commenting later today from Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall following Mr Major's speech to the Scottish Tory
conference. How many seats will they manage to fill? What will the
average age be? Will recently redundant councillors swallow hard and
join in the standing ovation? Will the Prime Minister be less warmly
received than Mr Portillo, who has already beaten the Chancellor on the
clapometer?
Outside in the city of Glasgow the reality will be of not a single
Tory MP and precisely three councillors of that persuasion, in a city
which they occasionally ran within relatively recent memory.
As long as places like Glasgow, and indeed much else of Scotland, were
the exceptions rather than the rules, then arrogance could prevail. That
is what has now changed so dramatically, particularly after last week's
local elections.
In a perverse sort of way I suppose the Scottish Tories can take some
consolation from the fact that they are no longer out of step with the
rest of the country. Their southern soul-mates are now equally loathed.
The only place where the Tories did not receive a drubbing last week
was in London, for the simple reason that there were no elections there.
However, the current level of hostility to the party of government is at
fever pitch in the metropolis, partly due to the endeavours of Mrs
Virginia Bottomley.
The London Evening Standard has, since time immemorial, been one of
the Tories' staunchest and most influential allies. Yesterday's issue
printed the photographs of all the city's MPs who had voted in support
of Mrs Bottomley's plans under the tasty headline: ''44 MPs Who Betrayed
London''.
Mr Major doesn't have to worry too much about what I think or indeed
what Scotland thinks. When even the London Evening Standard decides that
it is time to take the gloves off with such brutality, then it is a fair
indication that the difficulties are terminal.
Just look at the Tories' actions, as opposed to words, since the local
government humiliations. The next day Mr Major went into Forrest Gump
mode and shambled out to a microphone in Downing Street, to talk about
listening and learning.
Who were the Tories listening to when they decided to press ahead with
the closure of London's great hospitals, in the face of the kind of
hostility which last night's Standard epitomised. ''Never in
parliamentary history,'' it editorialised, ''can parliamentary support
have been given so grudgingly.'' But given it was, and how the 44 must
live with the consequences.
Whom were they listening to when they decided to press ahead with
nuclear privatisation, which has all the potential for another
catastrophe in the public opinion stakes, as the true procession of
costs and question marks unfolds over the next year?
The Tories now confuse the ability to manage news for 24 hours with a
triumph for the policy itself. Persuading the Scottish edition of the
Daily Express to write daft headlines about ''Lang's Triumph'' does not
detract one iota from the reality, which is that a respected,
technology-based Scottish company is to become an outpost of a much
larger company to facilitate privatisation.
Whom was Mr Major listening to before he went into the House of
Commons yesterday and made such thoroughly offensive remarks about the
closure of ABB's railway works in York, with the loss of 700 jobs. This,
proclaimed the Prime Minister, had as much to do with rail privatisation
as ''an outbreak of measles''.
Is he such a fool as to believe this? Does he know that the past year
is the first in railway history that there has not been a single order
placed for new trains to serve the national railway network, because
nobody is in a position to order them? Did he give a moment's thought to
the impact of his words in York, and neighbouring constituencies, where
the reality is all too well understood?
The list of examples could, within a week of the English electorate
passing its judgment and a further month of the Scots showing the way,
be extended considerably. The truth is that they have learned absolutely
nothing, either in terms of policy or humility.
That's good news, I suppose, from Labour's point of view. But how much
more damage is going to be done along the way. That is what terrifies
me.
Meanwhile, the hapless Mr Godfrey presses on in the Perthshire
by-election. Some bampot has apparently advised him that the way to deal
with the SNP is to insinuate that they are Hitler's heirs. They are, I
would suggest, several more valid critiques which could be offered
before reaching that state.
I leave Mr Godfrey with a thought, which he might reflect upon before
pursuing this theme. I have a wonderful picture of some 500 guests sat
down in 1938 to celebrate Hitler's birthday at the German Embassy in
London. Each had in front of him a little napkin bearing the swastika
emblem.
If the Nazis had prevailed, these were the people who would have ruled
Britain. Who were they? I would love to have the full list of those
attending. But I think we can be confident, Mr Godfrey, that very few of
them voted SNP, Liberal or Labour before or after the Second World War.

CHILDREN'S entertainment in Scotland has been vegetating in a pleasant
but mediocre hiatus for the past few years. Lots of sub-standard acts
surfacing for a couple of months, a strong core of passable numbers
doing the same yearly circuit, and a couple of star turns drawing the
big crowds.
Nothing new, spectacular, or different, until the Happy Gang burst on
to the scene at the 1994 festival fringe, with theatre, singalongs, and
drama workshops.
Originally part-time, the reviews and response were so good that they
took the plunge and gave up their day jobs. As trained singers,
musicians, and actors the trio -- Beth Allen, Allan Dunn, and Alan
Penman -- boast a wealth of experience, from Taggart to musical director
to composer of children's musicals performed country-wide.
As the parent, I admit to expecting the Happy Gang to fall into the
usual so-so category. My cynicism evaporated in minutes. Presented with
the most original and dynamic piece of children's entertainment
imaginable, with very powerful storylines and themes, I was as enchanted
as the rest of the audience. An intrinsic part of the act is a thread of
adult jokes and witticisms -- totally non-smutty! -- which makes a
refreshing change for the reluctant chaperone.
Susan Heggie, business co-ordinator for the group, is quietly
confident about their road to success. Their natural empathy with
children is patently obvious, while their ethos is that children should
be given a quality product, and there is no excuse for poor productions
and dreadful musical standards just because a young audience can be
depended on to sing along.
Their aim is to set new standards of excellence, and a step-up from
the often ponderous musical arrangements and predicable delivery which
typifies too many children's shows. They are currently presenting two
musical adventures, Treasure Hunt and Happy Gang Saves the World, and
through them are introducing three characters who will surely achieve
cult status with the three-to-10 age group.
This week they are performing in schools and nurseries throughout
Strathclyde. These performances are already fully booked, but the
Scottish International Children's Festival in Edinburgh (May 22-28)
offers another chance to see them in action when they host the Happy
Tent.

LIKE the woman in the song who danced with a man who danced with a
girl who danced with the Prince of Wales I feel I have some distant
acquaintance with M Jacques Chirac, the new President of France. His
sharp profile and hungry rictus have stayed with me down the decades
since 1977, when he and I attended the opening of the Georges Pompidou
National Centre for Arts and Culture in Paris.
There were a few other people there, too, and Chirac and I didn't
actually get to speak. As I remember I talked mainly to a girl from
Suddeutsche Zeitung, who was standing beside me in the little corral
where they'd roped the press, and he talked mainly to the other people
in the platform party: President Giscard d'Estaing, smiling his wintry
little smile (he was tempted to cancel the Ffr110m project which his
late predecessor had set up), Madame Francoise Giroud, Minister of
Culture, who said it had been ''conceived in a period of financial
euphoria'', and the blonde, strong-jawed Widow Pompidou, who fought to
advance its cause and was now savouring her triumph.
Names from the past, my children! That's how far back Jacques Chirac
goes. The Parisians have long since stopped calling the Pompidou Centre
''le petroleum'' or ''Laideville'' (Uglyville) and settled for the
inoffensive ''Beaubourg'', in which quarter it stands. Its gleaming
fabric has grown shabby, and the entrails of its revolutionary design
have been copied in dozens of mediocre derivatives throughout the world.
On the day the centre opened Paris turned out in its thousands to
float to the top of its seven floors in the glass tube elevator, like
air bubbles rising in a test tube. Six weeks later the new leader of the
French right, a Pompidou man by instinct and inclination, floated to the
top of the civic pecking order and became Mayor of Paris. To those who
had watched the raucous rally which launched the Rassemblement pour la
Republique, Jacques Chirac's political life plan seemed right on
schedule. It was well know Chirac wanted to be President.
The Mayor of Paris is a very different office from, say, the Lord
Provost of Glasgow, or even the Lord Mayor of London. The distance
between the Hotel de Ville and the Elysee Palace is not great, and the
people of Paris have a long tradition of flying the colours of national
government. Chirac's unexpected victory in the municipal elections of
1977 put him on course for the presidency; or so we said at the time.
But -- the great cliche about all capital cities -- Paris is not
France. Years passed, twice he became Prime Minister, but after her
husband's second presidential election defeat by Francois Mitterrand in
1988 even Bernadette Chirac was moved to admit sadly, ''La France n'aime
pas mon mari.'' There was something about the grinning, glad-handing
Gaullist which displeased the lieges outside the capital.
Until Sunday. Eighteen years on, and Chirac's ambition has finally
vaulted him into the Elysee. What will Madame Chirac have to say now?
''La France aime mon mari un petit peu?'' He got only 52% of the vote;
it was enough. But as he wakes up each morning of this heady week,
sipping the sweetness of dreams come true with his cafe au lait, will he
feel any tremors of doubt or regret? You've got yourself the big one,
Jacques. What happens now? It isn't only the rich who are different from
the rest of us; even more different are the avariciously ambitious.
Chirac is now 62. He is about to take on the Herculean problems and
terrifying responsibilities of governing a complex modern state -- a
task which was once described by Rebecca West, in her weathered wisdom,
as ''trying to harness hurricanes''. At his age -- what the heck, at ANY
age -- I would prefer to be be lying in the long, sunlit grass of a
Normandy orchard staring at the apple blossom.
Ambition such as Chirac's, and before him Mitterrand's, which waited
just as long for satisfaction, and perhaps the ambition of Michael
Heseltine (who is also 62 and almost certainly still craves the tenancy
of Number 10) sails far beyond the shores of our own wee dreams. It is
awesome in its self-belief. It can't be driven only by a lust for power
or a need to succeed. These guys actually believe they're the right
people for the job.
Whereas I've come to feel that one great thing about getting older is
that you don't feel you're right for any kind of job except, perhaps,
sniffing the roses, and even better you don't care. So Jim won't fix it
after all; so you're never going to own a Harley Davidson or have your
own television chat show or endow the nation with equal opportunities,
an infallible fiscal policy, and universal access to the Internet, but
at least your children quite like you.
When I was young my ambition was to write a novel; I believed writing
a novel would banish any demon of inadequacy you care to mention, that
once you got yourself between hard covers a magical, shining aura would
surround and protect you for the rest of your life. But now I know so
many people whose not-bad-but-not-all-that-good novels have got into
print that I no longer want to add to their numbers. The world is full
of indifferent novels. Why forego the darling buds of May to swell their
ranks?
THE way Scotland looks at this time of year I want to roll around in
it, sponge up the spring with my skin. France looks much the same, but
you don't have time to stop for beauty when you're running countries and
harnassing hurricanes. Look what happened to Michael Heseltine when he
tried to take time off in Venice: his heart went on the blink. The
choice is not between life and art, or even life and politics. It's
between life and ambition.

IT IS Saturday night. I am standing in the Elcho Bar with several
chums and two of my many god-daughters. I have been boring my chums
stupid about The War, and they have been boring me half-witted about The
War. But my two god-daughters are wonderfully intrigued by my stories
about The War. I have been recalling the long lonely nights in Biggin
Hill, the sheer excitement of the ''scramble'' when myself and Guy
Gibson jumped into our Spitfires. I told the girls I then sported a
handlebar moustache and shagged Anna Neagle after she appeared in a
review at the Windmill Theatre. ''It never closed'' I said.
After our sorties we came back at dawn and breakfasted on eggs and
bacon. Then we spent the rest of the day writing latters to grieving
mums and dads about how their sons -- our pals -- had croaked it over
Cologne. Empty seats for our fallen comrades. Stiff upper lips. It took
all of 10 minutes for Karen and Sarah to realise that I was telling lies
enough for Baron Munchausen on Buckfast. In a pub in Airdrie.
Incidentally it suddenly occurred to me that Guy Gibson, who was in
Bomber Command in fact, had the most politically incorrect dug in the
history of world cinema. His dug's name was ''Nigger''. Just as well
really that his dug is deid. So is Guy Gibson. So were six million Jews.
Give me politically correct. Here, that's enough. Back to the beginning.
It is Saturday night and I am in the Elcho Bar. It is one of only two
pubs in the South Side of Glasgow which have been permitted a late
licence for Mayfest. Nobody quite knows why only two pubs have a licence
on the South Side because all the city centre pubs and restaurants have
a licence till one o'clock and lots of West End establishments have too.
It is said that culture only occurs in those spots, but the Soo-Side has
perhaps the most prestigious theatre -- the Citz -- in Europe, and a
venue for two horribly august theatrical productions, the Tramway, and
the most visited, per foot, art gallery in Britain, the Burrell. But no
late licences for restaurants and pubs on the South Side have been
issued since the year of culture.
It was a surprise thus that the Elcho, a small, respectable little pub
with a nice cross-generational clientele, and Sharkey's in the Gorbals,
another wee pub with a generally respectable customer group, managed to
obtain a late licence at all. This means quite a lot to the publicans,
and somewhat more to the customers who would quite like to celebrate
Mayfest. And this last weekend, Victory in Europe. There were street
parties all over England.
I'll tell you what there was in the Elcho Bar on Saturday night. There
was a phalanx -- perhaps Falange would be more appropriate -- of seven
polizei from the nearby Aitkenhead police station at ten past one, well
within drinking-up time, and them telling us to curb any celebration at
all and to drink up and go home to the beds our fathers had fought for.
I will say this: the gendarmes were polite and courteous and amiable
even.
But what in the name of jaysus were they doing there? Who was the
Falangist Kommandant in Aitkenheid Road polis station who thought up the
idea of sending sivvin flatfeet to terrorise a collection of wee
middle-aged men and their wee god-daughters at ten past one on a
Saturday night when the wee men were telling lies about the war? Who
thought it up when these streets are full of hooligans in the city
centre and the day after is going to see the full theatricality of
sectarian bigotry called a Rangers versus Celtic match? Which fascist
thought this up? And something else.
The polis weren't in uniform. At least not one I could recognise. Sir
Percy Sillitoe would not have recognised his bobbies of old. They were
all, these oppressors of the people, clad in para-military jerseys with
badges and stuff. Instead of hiding away their batons, as the Mr Plods
of yesteryear did, down the inside of their breeks, they were sporting
their new-style weaponry, including their new-style lightweight
handcuffs. If it weren't for the simple fact that the polis who turned
up at this pub late on Saturday/Sunday were rather elderly themselves
and clearly did not relish the task to which they had been appointed I
would have taken them for continentals, even French. Have you
encountered European police? Surely we don't want ourselves to follow
the route of that level of militarist authoritarianism?
A last wee thought. Mayfest has been miserable enough, sweet Lord.
Glasgow is miserable enough. Tourists must be astonished as I am myself
at the paucity of fun when so much performing talent abounds. What they
don't need is polis shouting at them. They are looking for PC 49 or
Dixon of Dock Green. Good night all. But early to bed. And leave Anna
Neagle alone.

TO THE concert hall in Glasgow for the Scottish Tory conference, where
at last we get to meet the legendary Carrick Cumnock, Conservative MP
for Brigadoon South.
Despite spending most of his formative years in the family's estates
in Wiltshire and being only recently returned to the House as an
Ayrshire MP, Carrick is well-connected in the Conservative and Unionist
scene and is ideally placed to contribute the following thoughts on the
conference:
SO GOOD to see that we Conservatives remain the party of law and
order. The concert hall is like a fortress and the adjacent streets have
been closed off to keep at a distance these Glasgow people, socialist
johnnies to a man.
There are only about 300 of us inside the hall, with double that
number of police and security staff to look after us. If that's not a
boost to the Glasgow economy, with all the police overtime, then I don't
know what is.
But what is this? A huge banner is emblazoned across the building
opposite the conference venue. It says ''Time Up For The Tories'' and is
interchanged daily with other messages reading ''General Election Now!''
and ''Time To Go, John!''
It transpires that the banner is draped across the windows of the
offices of a theatre group called 7:84. These are the chappies who use
taxpayers' money to travel the country putting on plays trying to make
out that the Highland Clearances weren't an unfortunate but necessary
part of the process of land reform.
Must have a word with my contact at the Scottish Arts Council about
having their grant axed forthwith. It transpires that the banner
business is the brainchild of the 7:84 chairman, a dangerous radical by
the name of Bill Speirs. He is a deputy general-secretary of the STUC,
the Scottish Trades Unionists and Commies organisation.
Must have a word with STUC general-secretary Campbell Christie at the
next board meeting of Mining Scotland plc about getting this Speirs
fellow his jotters.
On the subject of law and order, I can't understand what our Lord
Advocate and Solicitor-General are doing allowing the case involving my
colleague Allan Stewart and that alleged pick-axe to come to court two
days before the voting in the Perth and Kinross by-election. Must have a
word with Jimmy Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor about this.
But on with the conference. I have come to Glasgow to watch Sir Hector
Monro in action. I fully expect to succeed Sir Hector in the job of food
and fisheries minister at the Scottish Office.
Sir Hector is a marvellous old stick, still fit as a butcher's dog at
the age of 73 and extremely capable of holding down his portfolio. There
were those who carped about him referring in his speech to ''the last
time our party conference met in Glasgow it was 1958. I was here and
spoke on farming.'' Yes, we know the last time was actually 1963, but
what's five years measured against Sir Hector's long and valued
contribution to the party.
I was also delighted to see my old school chum, the Hon Adam Bruce,
make a sparkling contribution to the debate on farming and fishing. Adam
and I shared a billet at Glenalmond and many a happy evening we spent
toasting our muffins at an open fire and discussing the way ahead for
the Tory Party in Scotland.
Adam has always been a diffident sort of chap, which is perhaps why he
has not yet been able, unlike my good self, to snap up a safe seat. In
his biography in the conference handbook he describes himself as being
''brought up in West Fife, where his father and brothers still farm''.
As everyone knows, his pater is the Earl of Elgin. I think it's time
we Scottish Tories stopped being cagey about our aristocratic
backgrounds. I am proud to be the second son of the Earl of Drongan and
will be proud one day to step up to the earldom and the post of grand
master of Lodge Boswell in Mauchline.
But back to young Bruce's speech. Echoing Sir Hector's statement on
fishery policy, that there would be no second Spanish armada pillaging
Britain's fishing grounds, he said: ''Let the order of the day go out to
our fishery protection vessels -- let the only words of Spanish be those
of Arnold Schwarzenegger, 'Hasta la vista, baby'.''
Young Bruce's Glenalmond education has certainly not gone to waste.
Can I fit in, at this juncture, a word of praise for my fellow
Ayrshire Tory MP, Phil Gallie? The man is utterly tireless. Just check
the list of fringe meetings at the conference.
A talk on the future of the Scottish aerospace industry: speaker, Phil
Gallie. A lunchtime debate on the Conservative Way Ahead: speaker, Phil
Gallie. Tackling homelessness in Scotland: speaker, Phil Gallie.
I don't know how Phil manages it. Oh, and one I nearly forgot to
mention -- a talk on Action on Dementia: speaker, Phil Gallie.
Unfortunately it is not given to us all to be invited to address so
many meetings. My lunchtime was fully occupied pursuing research into my
chosen special interest of food, farming, and fisheries.
And where better to study Scotland's food than the Ubiquitous Chip
restaurant in the West End of Glasgow. I managed to work my way through
the Oban-landed langoustines, the Ayr-landed cod, the gigot of
Renfrewshire mutton, and the pan-fried saddle of young wild boar from
Tomintoul.
But not the Aberdeen Angus fillet steak since I had to leave room for
the ''bread pudding with fruit fattened in Rutherglen muscat''. I didn't
even know Rutherglen had a vineyard. I have so much still to learn about
my native land.

THE highest standards in the conduct of public life are necessary for
the success of democracy. Not long ago that rather portentous sentence
would not have needed to be written, or if it had, it would have been
regarded as a statement so obviously true as to be something of a waste
of ink and paper. The fact that the Nolan Committee was, and continues
to be, necessary is a sign of just how far things have slipped. Of
course Lord Nolan is right when he and his colleagues say there is no
evidence of systematic corruption in public life. If there had been it
would have been carried out with a good deal more guile than the shabby
failings and transparent attempts at manipulation which led to the
establishment of the committee in the first place. Nevertheless, there
is enough evidence of worrying practices, particularly relating to
government and politicians, to deliver a substantial dunt to public
confidence in the governance of the nation. As Lord Nolan says in a
letter to the Prime Minister, the dangers of this leading to cynicism
and disillusionment are growing. These twin plagues comprise the most
common pincer movement to attack and damage democracy and must be fought
at every opportunity.
The Nolan Committee's proposals make a useful beginning for this task,
but continuing vigilance is necessary. The Government has accepted the
broad thrust of the recommendation and we will have to examine just how
broad, or narrow, this acceptance is in fact. The changes identified by
Nolan which have occurred over the years in the roles and working
environments of politicians and public servants, and which have led to a
slackening of the understanding of what is acceptable behaviour, have
not grown in a vacuum. They are the direct result of the sins of
commission and omission of the Government, and as there has been only
one flavour of government for the past 16 years, it would be wise for Mr
Major to absorb all of Nolan's strictures rather than their broad
thrust. There can, for instance, be few who will weep at the call for a
ban on MPs working for firms involved in lobbying. Any MP, of whatever
political persuasion, who takes money to advance the views of a
particular interest has forgotten that he is in Parliament to serve his
constituents and that this duty is incompatible with serving a lobbying
interest for cash or perks. Equally welcome is the proposal to establish
a strong commissioner to investigate complaints and a disciplinary
committee which will meet in public. Not just welcome, but worthy of
popping champagne corks, is the proposal to tighten up on ex-Ministers
taking jobs in private industry within two years of leaving office. Lord
Wakeham's job with the bank which advised the Government on electricity
privatisation, just six months after he left the Cabinet as Energy
Secretary, was a scandal which must not be repeated.
The continuing remit of the committee is to review progress on its
proposals, and this it must do with rigour. Just as important is the
need to extend the scope of its activities, particularly to an
examination of the funding of political parties. If ever there was an
area of politics which needed fresh air and transparency it is this. As
electors it should be our right to know the identity of those who have
funded both the winners and losers of an election. Similarly it is the
right of trade unionists and shareholders to know what is done with
their money. Membership of a union and a share in a company imply rights
which have been substantially ignored. This must stop, and the Nolan
Committee is the vehicle to do it.

WHAT can the Scottish Conservative conference taking place in Glasgow
tell us about modern Scots Tories? Principally that they are not in the
best heart. The sullen silence which greeted Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
on Wednesday was one sign of this; the ill-tempered row which erupted
yesterday over the Cathcart Declaration (a case of shooting the
messengers, if ever we saw one) is yet another pointer. True, the
Cathcart Declaration does not look like a very Tory document, though
defining the core values of Conservatives in the aftermath of the
vicious trampling which Thatcherism gave to one-nation Toryism in the
eighties is not an easy task. The Cathcart Declaration calls for a
referendum on Scottish home rule and other radical proposals such as
reviews of quangos to make them more accountable, income tax cuts to
make them non-obligatory, and housing policies to make them less
punitive. All heady stuff, and not at all what some Tories wanted to
hear.
The question resurrects itself. If this is not what Tories want to
hear, if they really believe that the mores of southern England do apply
to Scotland, and if the heroic John Young's assertion that he didn't get
where he is (one of only three Tory councillors in Glasgow) by toeing
the party line is unacceptable, what on earth do they want to hear?
Gentlemanly strictures from Mr Ian Lang yesterday seemed no nearer
fitting the bill. Mr Lang asked the party to rally behind John Major,
which is what would be expected of him. He biffed the devolutionists
once more but, against all visible evidence, he continued to insist that
the election results were a mid-term protest and that the central thrust
of Tory policies was basically sound. At this point Mr Lang departs from
reality and grievously underestimates the electorate. It is not
presentation, packaging or portrayal of policies which have upset
voters, but the consequences, feeding down into the streets, of the
policies themselves. People do by-and-large not blame their wait for NHS
treatment on doctors and nurses, but on Government policies; nor do they
blame their financial and job fears on the recession, but on the
Government policies which deepened it.
If the delegates gathered in Glasgow are truly representative of
Conservative supporters in Scotland, what they appear to want is
undoubtedly a swing to the right and the policies of Mr Portillo and Mr
Forsyth. Both men were unrepentant in their Thatcherism when they spoke
at the conference and on the fringe. Indeed, both men appeared at the
radical cutting edge of Thatcherism, which is a euphemistical way of
saying that some of their comments were marginally on the safe side of
political derangement. Mr Portillo spoke slightingly of ''little
Europe''. Is he aware that the EU is the world's largest market and that
a majority of British exports go there, to our great benefit? Mr
Forsyth, in his proposals to give extraordinary powers to local
communities, sounds ever more like a communard, or even a Spanish
anarchist of the thirties. Yet both men were warmly, even rapturously,
received by the conference. We must take this at face value. The Tory
delegates gathered in Glasgow liked what they heard from Portillo and
Forsyth. Now we must ask the crucial question: are the delegates
properly representative of current Scottish Conservatism? For the sake
of a proud and honourable party, and for the absolute requirement in
this country for political pluralism, this question must be answered.
Answers, please; we really want to know.

Space capsules used to splash down in the sea. But soon, James
McKillop reports, we could see a reversal, with satellites rising from
the ocean -- launched by a Clyde-built ship
THEY know a thing or two about launching ships on the Clyde, but the
notion that a Glasgow shipyard is determined to get involved in
launching rockets boggles the mind. Then again, why should it?
After all, Scotland prides itself on its innovation, and the
revolutionary idea of launching space satellites aboard a rocket
developed in the former Soviet Union, from a floating ramp in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean, controlled from a Clyde-built vessel five miles
off should capture the imagination.
First thoughts suggest that firing rockets carrying commercial
payloads from sea is bizarre. They have been sucessfully doing it for
years from land sites, so why go to the expense of constructing a
sophisticated ship that will transport rockets from Russia and the
Ukraine through the Panama Canal before launching from a
semi-submersible platform in the Pacific?
Further examination suggests it can make economic sense. The most
cost-effective place from which to launch a satellite is the equator,
and it is estimated that during the next decade there could well be 40
satellite launches a year.
A new company made up of Kvaerner, with its Glasgow link, the US
aircraft giant Boeing, and two companies from the former Soviet Union
with rocket expertise, believes it can capture up to 12 of these
lucrative contracts every year.
The closer you get to the middle of the earth the bigger the boost you
get from its rotation. ''Quite simply, the rocket is given a big kick up
the rear,'' I was told.
While the equator is the obvious choice for a launch site, there are
few politically acceptable regions which can make this a commercial
proposition.
The French launch their Ariane rockets from French Guiana. The
Americans go as far south as they can, to Cape Canaveral.
However, it is argued that neither of these launch pads will be able
to cope with the growing demand for commercial satellite launches.
Kvaerner's Govan yard hopes to win the lucrative contract to build the
command and transport ship. This will be an important order if it comes
off.
By any standard it will be a huge ship, costing perhaps #60m.
Certainly, in terms of bulk, it will be bigger than the landing platform
helicopter vessel currently being built at the Govan yard for the Royal
Navy. In terms of equipment, it will be highly advanced. ''Imagine all
those pictures of a NASA launch,'' I was told. ''The same command and
control systems will have to be on board.''
Safety would not be a problem. The rockets would not be fuelled until
they had been transferred to the semi-submersible launch pad. It was
also likely that the launch platform would be adapted from a
semi-submersible currently operating in the oil industry.
''It will be an extremely stable pad for a space launch,'' I was told.
If the original projections are confirmed, then the vessel will be
fitted out with three huge dishes on the top deck. ''If the dishes were
put in place in Govan, the ship would not get under Erskine Bridge.'' If
the contract does eventually come to Scotland a decision has yet to be
made as to whether these dishes would be fitted at the tail of the bank
or, as is more likely, in Russia.
Nothing is certain at the moment. The future of the project will
depend entirely on the outcome of a feasibility study, and even if this
proves positive it is by no means certain that Govan will win the work.
The yard is in competition with Kvaerner's new facility in what was once
East Germany, and the Government there is more than anxious to ensure as
much work as possible flows in.
However, the Govan management team is convinced that they have the
know-how to win the deal for Scotland. In its transport role, the vessel
will look very much like a huge Ro-Ro ferry, and Govan is second to none
in this technology. It is an order that would guarantee two years work
at the yard and the project has caught the imagination of the Govan
management team.

The bad old days of airport chaos could return as upgrading of
Scotland's air traffic control system faces indefinite delay, reports
Anne Johnstone
A DECADE ago it was almost an annual ritual. At the beginning of every
Glasgow Fair the airport was transformed into a vast refugee camp.
Reporters picked their way among the tight-packed bodies, interviewing
miserable or falsely jolly newlyweds who should have been in Palma or
Corfu, while the departure boards flashed up against their flights the
gloomy message: ''Indefinite delay.''
Air travel was expanding fast, but air traffic control facilities
weren't able to keep pace. It has taken more than a decade for Britain's
National Air Traffic Services (NATS), run by the Civil Aviation
Authority, to get their act together. Management changes, investment in
new technology and increasing co-operation with other European air
traffic control services have combined to transform NATS into a model of
modern efficiency.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, not normally generous
with his praise, recently described this metamorphosis as an
''unparalleled renaissance of an organisation in the public sector''.
Between 1992 and 1994, average delays on outward-bound international
flights were reduced from 14 minutes to five. But now the controllers
are warning of the return of the bad old days of long delays at peak
periods unless the Government soon comes to a decision about their
future.
European air traffic is expected to double between 1990 and 2003.
About #600m needs to be invested in Britain's air traffic control
services to enable them to keep abreast of this exploding demand. About
#330m of it will go on replacing the outmoded air traffic control centre
at Prestwick, where 160 controllers look after the increasingly busy
routes over the North Atlantic.
Dougie Maclean, a controller at Prestwick, and UK public relations
officer for the Institute of Professionals, Managers and Specialists,
says: ''Because of the massive increase in traffic we're expecting, we
need the new technology that the new control centre is going to give us
to handle it safely. Without it, we'll have to slow the traffic down
again.''
Conventionally, the CAA has funded investment by borrowing from the
public sector borrowing requirement, then repaying the debt from the
handsome surplus it makes each year in fees from airlines. For several
years the Government, keen to restrain the PSBR, has been considering
privatising NATS.
But although the move is favoured by the CAA, virtually everyone else
is against it, including the Labour Party, most airlines, neighbouring
air traffic operators, and British air traffic controllers. No other
country operates a privatised air traffic control system. Recently, the
all-party Transport Select Committee, chaired by former Tory Transport
Minister Paul Channon, also expressed considerable reservations about
the privatisation plan.
Now there is a strong rumour that Brian Mawhinney, current incumbent
of the post, has ditched the idea. But nobody has told the Treasury,
where mandarins continue to assume that privatisation will go ahead and
that no future financial provisions need to be made for it from the
public purse.
This leaves the CAA with an awkward dilemma. To avoid adding to the
already hefty PSBR, the authority has been instructed to finance the new
control centre at Prestwick by means of what is known as a ''private
financial initiative'' (PFI). The other candidate for this treatment is
the problematic Channel Tunnel rail link. Basically the process involves
putting the job out to tender with the idea that a small consortium will
take on various bits of the contract on a lowest-tender basis.
The Prestwick control centre got the go-ahead in the 1993 Budget, and
originally it was intended to be operational by 1997. But because of the
complexities of the project and the difficulty of putting the PFI
together amid continued uncertainty about the future of the service, the
timetable has slipped badly. It is now unlikely to be finished before
2001, and in the meantime controllers believe lengthening delays for air
passengers are inevitable.
Meanwhile, the CAA has been trying to convince the Government that a
PFI is an absurd way to proceed. ''It's better than having no money at
all, but it's not ideal,'' said a CAA spokesman yesterday. He added:
''It's also extremely complicated, because under this sort of agreement
we don't get ownership of the site when the work is finished. That
remains with the companies who built it; so the building might be owned
by one company and the equipment by another.''
Dougie Maclean, of the IPMS, says such a framework is completely
unsuited to an air traffic control centre, which he describes as ''like
a living animal, taking in vast amounts of data from different sources
then processing it and churning it out into worldwide networks''. He
believes that in the event of something going wrong, companies in the
consortium are likely to start blaming each other: ''It will be a
manager's nightmare and a solicitor's dream.''
And because investors will have to borrow at commercial rates, it will
cost more than a loan via the PSBR. The CAA will have to recover the
extra cost by increasing charges to airlines, and the passenger will
foot the bill through dearer fares.
Maybe Costa Clyde isn't such a bad spot for a summer holiday after
all.

* IMAGINE a crisis call to the plumber and being told: ''Sorry, he's
taking a mental health day.'' It's already happening in Sweden, and it
seems the idea could be usefully imported to Britain. Swedish workers
can take five ''mental health days'' a year, allowing them time off
without having to make excuses.
In a national survey about male attitudes to health here -- published
this week -- nearly a third of men admitted taking time off pretending
to be ill, when they really wanted to escape stress at work.
Experts estimate 40% of absenteeism is stress-related: worrying about
the mortgage, the car and foreign holidays -- or, more properly, how to
hang on to the job that funds a nineties lifestyle.
Only 15% of the 5000 men in the survey -- for Men's Health magazine --
felt able to confide in the doctor, and for those who could, the biggest
fear is cancer, followed by heart disease and the brain disorder
Alzheimer's. Fewer than one in 10 was worried about Aids. Men in
Scotland complained most about the absence of Well-Man clinics and
wanted regular, free health check-ups.
* Alzheimer Scotland has opened a free phone dementia health line.
Call the 24-hour service on 0800 317817.
* MORE than 80,000 volunteers are expected to back BT Environment Week
which, between May 19 and 29, tackles a wide range of projects
throughout Scotland, including cleaning up graffiti and litter, planting
trees and wildlife conservation.
In its 11th year, the campaign has become the biggest of its kind,
with #6000-worth of grants to worthwhile community projects in Scotland.
Action programmes are being launched in Strathclyde, Central Region,
Tayside, Grampian, and Lothian and Borders. To join in phone the
environment hotline, 0141-248 6864.

Parent pressure is
forcing supermarkets
to make children more
welcome, reports
Elizabeth Westcott
PICTURE this: it's Saturday morning and you are in a supermarket with
two small children, and the weekly groceries to buy. At the precise
moment you realise one of the children has disappeared amidst a clash of
barging trolleys, the other makes a lunge for an attractive jar, which
predictably smashes into a million shards of jam-smeared glass.
Shopping with children in tow is never going to be fun. However, a new
trend is seeing retailers do their best to minimise the hassles involved
for parents and make shopping a less stressful experience for all
concerned.
It is, of course, very much in the interests of retailers to woo these
customers. Parents are probably the most serious shoppers of all, and
with very little to choose between major chain stores in terms of price
and range of goods offered, what remains is the standard of service they
can provide.
If customers want baby-changing facilities, wider aisles,
state-of-the-art shopping trolleys and even creches, then retail stores
are going to have to introduce them.
According to Safeway spokesperson Odette Sullivan, this is exactly
what supermarkets in Britain are now doing. Safeway is currently
undergoing a major review and catering for the needs of families has
become a top priority.
''Parents are prime shoppers and we want to keep them in our stores,''
she said. ''We're all fighting over the same customers. I think all
stores are becoming more aware of parents' needs, and customers feel
they should be looked after; after all, they're spending a lot of money.
If a store isn't parent-friendly then they will go to a store that is.''
Safeway has set up a panel of 1500 parents which is expected to
contribute to parent-friendly innovations. Already parents have
suggested wider parking spaces for families, easy-to-steer trolleys and
sweet-free checkouts, all of which have been implemented. New stores
will have baby-changing facilities and creches built into them. Although
this means giving up valuable floor-selling space, Odette Sullivan says
it is worth it.
''It will make shopping easier, and people want that,'' she said. ''We
have creches in 14 stores and children love them. They are built like
fantasy supermarkets, with slides built from packet sweets, brown balls
like maltesers and see-saws of Edam cheese. There's another area where
children can sit down and draw, or play video games, and they are
watched over by trained NNEB nannies.''
Security is another aspect which is of growing concern to parents.
Safeway creches have a security tag system which ensures the right
''parent'' collects the child. In Safeway cafes, the toddlers' seating
area is centrally located, so as to be visible to all.
A new BHS store, which recently opened in the Grafton centre,
Cambridge, as a family-oriented prototype, has also taken security into
consideration, along with a whole swag of parent-friendly innovations.
The children's play areas have been designed to be visible from all
corners of the department. Changing rooms, clearer merchandise displays
and entertainment for children have all been introduced to make shopping
more enjoyable for families.
Tesco supermarkets have always been conscious of the need to cater to
parents, and they do a good job. The chain has won the
''parent-friendly'' award two years running from the charity Tommy's
Campaign, which researches stillbirths and miscarriages. According to a
Tesco spokesperson, all changes implemented in their stores are driven
by what the customers want.
''Obviously a very high proportion of customers are families, so we
have bottle warming and baby changing facilities,'' he said.
''Speaking as the father of a nine month old baby, I must say the
facilities are very good. I was really impressed.''
Clea Caisley, public relations manager for Tommy's Campaign, says it
is important that stores reduce the stress for parents: ''Trying to
manoeuvre a buggy through heavy doors, or trying to manage money while
hanging onto a baby -- sometimes these things can be the straw that
breaks the camel's back.
''When parents fill in the voting forms for the awards, they sometimes
add several sides worth of A4 paper -- they tell us about frustrating
experiences with unhelpful shop staff and lack of facilities.''
The awards certainly make retailers sit up and take notice. When Marks
&amp; Spencer won the ''dirty nappy'' award two years ago, they immediately
looked into what could be done to rectify the situation, according to
spokesperson Sue Saddler.
''We didn't like getting that award! Four complaints emerged from
parents: the heavy doors, sweets at the checkouts, lack of toilets and
staff not being helpful enough. We've addressed all those things,
including giving staff training to make them more aware of the special
needs of parents.''
Colourful creches with giant cereal boxes and television screens
playing cartoons are not on the M &amp; S agenda, however.
''While we treat parent-friendliness as a very important issue, we are
there as a store, not a creche,'' said Saddler.
With retailers across the country vying for their custom, parents are
going to benefit from their ever more inventive ways of standing out
from the crowd. Odette Sullivan believes the huge range of choice
available gives the consumer more power than ever before. Facilities for
families will soon be the norm.
''When barcode scanners were introduced at checkouts they were a
novelty -- now we would find it odd to be in a supermarket without them.
It's going to become the same with creches and baby changing rooms.
Parents will expect them as a matter of course.''

How soft can drinkers get? Stephen McGinty invites some studious
imbibers to try fizziology
TRIED AND TASTED
THERE exists an apocryphal story about a famous Scottish footballer
who attended a posh dinner and was asked by a waiter if he wished ginger
on his melon. He replied: ''No thanks pal, we've already ordered from
the wine list.''
So it is that the Scots love affair with soft drinks often ends in
divorce if there is a choice between Irn Bru and alcohol. But today, if
you walk into a bar and ask for a soft drink, you'll be offered more
than just a Martini.
An entire new range of trendy soft drinks sold at inflated prices --
but without offering 20p back on the bottle -- are available for the
frantic hostess faced with the dreaded teetotal guests.
Now those on a health drive need not sit naked but for a carton of
orange juice or a jug of water, but can coolly sip the nectars of the
gods straight out of a sculpted wine glass.
Unlike Cremola Foam, these drinks pour smoothly and don't look like a
bubble bath. But they can clean you out. Not since pre-war Guinness
adverts have drinks promised so much health for so little.
Ame is choked with ''revitalizing eastern herbs''; Purdey's, a
multi-vitamin sports drink, is now an ''elixir vitae'' which makes you
live forever. Just kidding. While Rabenhorst is a ''valuable supplement
to the daily food intake''. So it's a medicine.
But can you drink them? What do they taste like? Will your friends all
laugh?
To find out, we applied the same rigorous taste tests which top wines
pass through, -- ie, a group of friends gargled and spat the contents
into a punch-bowl.
Hauled from the quiet halls of academia, marketing, and the insurance
game were Denise Mina, Scott Dickson, Lyndsey Burnside and Jim Burke,
who agreed to try the taste test. Early on, Jim complained at the lack
of ''Gusto'' lemonade, which he describes as ''the special brew of soft
drinks''. Still, we started with:
ELDERFLOWER
#2.35 for 75cl
DON'T say it's a champagne or you'll be down in the dock. But this
sparkling little number is rather good.
Denise: ''It's nice, it cleans your palate out ... well, it does for
me, I eat burgers all the time.''
Lyndsey: ''It's fine but I wouldn't buy it.''
Scott and Jim wanted to know who had eaten the elderflowers so they
could claim that it tastes like it.
AQUA LIBRA (Dry)
#1.99 for 75cl
A CONSENSUS of opinion was reached that Aqua Libra Dry tasted like a
cross between Lilt and cheap cider ... ''But that doesn't mean we didn't
like it!''
''It's the soft-drink for the underage teetotaler'' declared Denise
with a flourish. Drinks can evoke an atmosphere and Aqua Libra said to
Jim: ''Campsie Cemetery, 1973'', and for Lyndsey: ''The woods behind
Canniesburn Hospital.'' Fresh with a taste of the outdoors.
DUCHY ORIGINALS No 1
#2.85 for 75cl
THE Prince Of Wales has launched his own brand of herb and fruit
drinks as the Duchy of Cornwall, hence a price fit for a prince. But his
exotic blend of rosemary illicited descriptions like: ''An expensive
herby Kwenchi Kup'' and a ''taste like cola jubilees''. Jim summed it
up: ''It's a bit like Charles -- tries too hard and yet still misses the
mark.''
AME RED
#1.99 for 75cl
COMPLIMENTED by a corresponding bottle of white, Ame has become the
dinner drink to help the health-concious wash down their tofu salad. But
how does it go with pickled onion Monster Munch?
''Too sweet for me,'' declared Lyndsey, now suffering aversion
therapy. As Ame smells and tastes like elderberries -- would you
recognise one? -- it attracts a clientele of sophisticates, willing to
shell out their shekels for a fruit-choked drink.
PURDEY'S
#1.15 for 25cl
THE hard man's Aqua Libra comes in a glass bottle wrapped in silver
paper. Just as well -- poured in a glass it looks like a sample. But it
tastes just great ... well, as great as herbs, lemon, and ginger
(different kind). Denise, Scott, and Lyndsey all liked it, while Jim
looked at the social aspects. ''Drinks like Miller say 'Tough cowboys'
-- this says 'Wiener-boy'.''
JIVE
69p for 75ml
THOUGH Denise insisted Jive's colour was the same as her face after a
bad exercise class, everybody liked it. ''Rare swallow'', ''Goes down
well'', and ''mildly refreshing'' hung in the air after the lid was
lifted. As fizzy fruit drinks go, Jive ignores pretentious turnpike and
just delivers the goods.
It's like a packet of Fruitella squeezed and poured into a wee squat
bottle. The final verdict was: ''Good drink, bad name''.
RABENHORST
#2.89 for 750ml
THIS apricot nectar rolls past the tonsils like an non-alcoholic
advocaat. ''This is a wee auntie's drink,'' said Lyndsey, screwing up
her face. Sauce-like Rabenhorts slumps into the glass and then delivers
a sugar rush as soon as it's consumed. ''You couldn't drink a lot of
it,'' commented Scott, ''you'd be sick after a couple.'' Denise thought
it would be good for cooking.
* DESPITE drinking gallons of ''elixirs'', ''revitalising blend of
eastern herbs'' and ''valuable supplements'', all the test tasters
finished feeling unhealthy. Jim and Lyndsey thought they had developed a
new strain of hangover, so instantly reached for Irn Bru, 60p for 750ml.
Which, of course, won the taste test.
''The SNP can say what they like about the benefits of being
independent but this stuff is the evidence,'' declared Jim. Irn Bru, a
''genuine ginger'', is currently attempting to expand across Britain,
hopefully at the expense of the more inflated soft drinks.
Till then, we'll continue to sprinkle ginger on our melons. Ginger on
Melon, good name for a drink!

A SCOTTISH glass engineering company which exports its products
throughout the world is having to mark some of them with the words Made
in England because of Scotland's lack of identity overseas, according to
the SNP (Keith Sinclair writes).
The SNP candidate in the Perth and Kinross by-election, Roseanna
Cunningham, said yesterday that she was astonished to learn earlier this
week that Spectraglass of Inveralmond, near Perth, has been told by one
of its customers to mark glass tubes as being English-made.
Spectraglass confirmed yesterday that the Pakistani Railway Company,
which uses the tubes in steam locomotive boilers, has for several years
been stipulating that the tubes should be clearly identified in this
way.
The Scottish firm, which employs 26 people, has previously attempted
to convince the state-owned railway company that the tubes should be
marked as Scottish or British-made, but has since been meeting their
customer's specifications.
Mr Ken Pullar, administration director of Spectraglass, said
yesterday: ''We label the tubes in this way under duress but at the end
of the day the customer is king.''
He added: ''Pakistani Railways apparently think that Britain is
England and don't seem to know that Scotland exists. They have never
fully explained why, but I think its goes back to the colonial days.''
The SNP yesterday used the case to support its claim that Scotland's
''submerged'' position in the UK was preventing Scottish exporters from
maximising their potential for overseas trade.
Ms Cunningham also cited a report by the former Scottish Development
Agency in 1990, based on a survey in four major European cities, which
she said illustrated the ''crying need'' for Scottish independence.
Commenting on part of the report which referred to concern that
Scottish products do not enjoy sufficient market differentiation from
generic British or English products, she said: ''This lack of a Scottish
image overseas means that exporters are unable to capitalise properly on
the positive perceptions that key consumer groups have of Scotland.''
Ms Cunningham added: on to say: ''Within the Union, Scotland is
Europe's invisible nation -- to the detriment of our business
performance,'' adding that Scottish business would benefit greatly from
a strong Scottish brand image and back-up which only independence in
Europe could provide.

A SURPRISE candidate emerged in the Perth and Kinross by-election
yesterday, when a rogue ''Scottish CONSERVATORY and Unionist'' candidate
lodged nomination papers.
Disillusioned Tory businessman Michael Halford, 46, entered the fray
with a description designed to split the already diminishing Tory vote.
Mr Halford, 46, said last night: ''I am disgusted at the Conservative
Party sending a boy to do a man's job in Perth and Kinross.''
Mr Halford, a publican from Dundee, disclosed details of a manifesto
which includes the local umemployed acting as beaters on the Perth and
Kinross grouse moors.
Last night, a Scottish Conservatives' spokesman said: ''The presence
of a fringe candidate calling himself a Scottish Conservatory and
Unionist represents a blatant spoiling tactic.''
Nine candidates had their nominations accepted for the Perth &amp; Kinross
by-election at the close of nominations yesterday.
They are: Douglas Alexander (Lab); Gary Black (Natural Law Party);
Roseanna Cunningham (SNP); John Godfrey (Con.); Michael Halford
(Scottish Conservatory and Unionist); Robin Harper (Scottish Green
Party); Vivian Linacre (UK Independence Party); Veronica Linklater
(Scottish Liberal Democrat); Lord David Sutch (Official Monster Munch
Raving Looney Party).

THE hot favourite to win the by-election in Perth and Kinross, the
Scottish National Party, has lost some ground in the latest
Herald/System Three monthly poll.
With the by-election just under two weeks away, the SNP has slipped
from 25% to 22%.
The poll gives some comfort to the Conservatives, as they searched
their political souls in Glasgow over which direction to take after
their disastrous showing in last month's local elections.
The party is up two points, from 11 to 13%, lifting it out of its
worst trough in 21 years of System Three surveys for The Herald which
had seen it stalled at 11% for three out of the four polls this year.
The poll also gives a timely shot in the arm to the Liberal Democrats,
who are up 3% from 9% to 12%.
Labour remains far out in front, down one at 52%.
Support for the Greens is unchanged at 1%.
The 3% drop left the SNP unworried. The party's chief executive, Mr
Michael Russell, said yesterday that the poll showed the party in strong
second place, ahead of its General Election result.
''The poll was conducted after the Scottish local elections during a
period when the political focus was on the local elections in England.
The three English-based parties have benefited from the increased
publicity during that time.
''The political focus has now moved back to Scotland with the
impending by-election at Perth and Kinross. I look forward to victory in
that contest and the boost in the polls which will follow as normal
service is resumed,'' he said.
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, said he was
pleased to see the ''modest increase'' in their support.
''The more significant decrease in the SNP share augurs well for our
chances in Perth and Kinross. The by-election and our conference give us
the ideal opportunities to explain why our policies are right for
Scotland,'' he said.
Labour, however, saw nothing in the latest poll, taken between April
27 and May 2, to lift the Tories out of their malaise.
Mr Jack McConnell, Labour's Scottish general secretary, said: ''We are
delighted that the messages and campaign of new Labour continue to enjoy
majority support in Scotland.
''The Tories at their conference should be embarrassed by yet more
derisory figures and the SNP bubble has burst. They peaked last summer
and have now dropped to General Election levels of support. Only Labour
can get rid of the Tories.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrats' good showing was warmly welcomed on
the hustings in Perthshire by party leader Jim Wallace. He said: ''This
is a significant increase in our vote which reflects our 25% rise in
council strength in April's elections and our successful conference in
Perth.
''The local election results clearly not only stalled the Nationalist
bandwagon but set it into reverse. Opinion polls also continue to
overrate Labour's support.
''These figures give a welcome boost to our campaign here in Perth and
Kinross which is already getting a good response on the doorsteps.''
* LABOUR has maintained its position ahead of the Conservative Party
in the Perth and Kinross campaign, according to a telephone poll carried
out for the Daily Record.
However, the Scottish National Party has extended its lead to
represent more than 50% of the electorate and stands a full 30 points
ahead of Labour.
After extracting 33% of ''don't knows,'' the poll shows the SNP with
52%; Labour 22%; Conservatives 19%; and the Liberal Democrats 6%.

THE CONSERVATIVES launched another controversial attack on their SNP
opponents in the Perth and Kinross by-election yesterday, just a week
after the Tories linked Scottish nationalism with Nazism in a party
election leaflet.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton started the
latest row on the hustings in Perth when he quoted Albert Einstein's
description of extreme nationalism as ''the measles of the human race.''
The Tory MP later denied that he was directing his comments at the
SNP, but Opposition parties were in no doubt that the Nationalists were
his intended target and condemned his remarks.
Speaking at a news conference alongside Mr John Godfrey, the Tory
candidate in Perth and Kinross, Lord James went on to say the
Conservatives wholeheartedly opposed Scottish nationalism because it was
''short-sighted, disruptive, and unrealistic.''
However, he claimed he was not referring to the SNP when citing
Einstein's view and said the scientist had been talking about
nationalism ''in its more virulent forms.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond, speaking at a news conference with Perth and
Kinross candidate Roseanna Cunningham, responded by saying: ''This
campaign has had many highlights so far, and we are only a week in, but
Lord James Douglas Hamilton quoting Einstein must take the biscuit.''
Mr Salmond added that he didn't think Lord James would want to be
associated with ''disreputable'' material the Tories had been issuing
during the campaign, and said he suspected the Minister had been given a
script which wasn't appropriate for the occasion.
Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Archy Kirkwood, attending a news
conference by local candidate Veronica Linklater, said of Lord James's
comment and last week's row: ''There is absolutely no doubt that this is
all a very carefully contrived plan by the Conservatives to divert
attention away from their own terrible record.''
Labour candidate Douglas Alexander claimed the Minister's remarks, and
some of the Tories' election literature, showed they were ''lashing out
to try to find a justification for people to continue supporting them.''
* Mr Alexander earlier used his news conference to warn that Perth,
where Railtrack employs 200 people, was in danger of losing those jobs
and the benefits to the local economy of rail services if the Tories'
privatisation plans were allowed to continue unchecked.
However, Transport spokesman Henry McLeish said Labour, which will
step up its campaign against rail privatisation next week, was confident
that the Government's plans would fail because they were falling apart.
Tory candidate John Godfrey claimed Scotland's tourist industry was
threatened by the other parties' plans to introduce a minimum wage and
forecast that many of the 10,000 tourist-based jobs in Tayside would be
jeopardised.
Liberal Democrat Mrs Linklater emphasised that education was her
priority and said there was a #50m backlog of repair work to schools in
Tayside, adding that Crieff had been waiting for a new primary school
for 20 years.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair and the party's young by-election candidate
Douglas Alexander rallied their troops in Perth last night with a vision
of ''one-nation'' socialism routing divided Conservative opposition.
Against a pale green backdrop with hardly a glimmer of red in sight,
more than 350 New Labour faithful dressed in their almost Armani suits,
joined a rapturous campaign rally which addressed new Labour policy in
tandem with promises of maintaining old-style socialism.
Mr Blair promised to fight drugs and crime while also promising to
renationalise the National Health Service and make a priority of finding
jobs for the long-term unemployed.
However, it was old-style Tory bashing which brought the faithful to
their feet.
Mr Alexander seized on the news that there are now 50 pairs of nesting
ospreys in Scotland claiming there were more ospreys than Scottish Tory
councillors.
Mr Blair thanked Jeremy Hanley for doing an excellent job in helping
Labour's cause.
''We are now in second place but I understand that Mr Hanley has not
been up here yet. You can rest assured that when he does come our cause
will be helped even more.''
This brought rapturous applause from the audience.
Mr Blair continued his assault saying the Tories were now in desperate
political straits, all they had left was to attack the Labour Party and
herald VE Day as a national celebration for the Tories.
''It's a shame that they are even driven to making political capital
out of something like that.''
''It says a lot about the Conservatives but it took Mr Portillo's
attack on the party's own Euro-sceptics to get a standing ovation at the
Conservatives' Scottish conference.''
Mr Blair's most telling political point came when he said ''After all
the Clause 4 debates, I can promise you that one thing I will certainly
re-nationalise will be the National Health Service.''
He urged voters in Perth and Kinross not to allow themselves to be
used by the SNP as a protest against the Tories.
In a concentrated attack on the Nationalists, he said people in the
constituency should reject both the Tories and independence. ''So to
those who are toying with the idea of voting SNP as a way of sending a
much needed message to the Tories, I say this: do not be used, do not
vote for something you do not believe in.''

CONSERVATIVE Eurorebel Bill Cash last night claimed that there was no
danger from nationalism, as long as it was democratic, and he insisted
that it was right and proper that more power should be delegated to
Scotland.
His views run counter to many of the Tory leaders in Scotland, who in
recent months have been portraying nationalism as a destructive force.
Speaking at a fringe meeting in Glasgow last night, Mr Cash, the MP
for Stafford, and a leading opponent within the Conservative Party of
the European Union, took a less hostile line on nationalism.
''Some fear a resurgence of nationalism. But there is no danger from
nationalism so long as it is combined with democracy and respect for
international law.''
As for Scotland, he stated: ''It is right and proper that more real
responsibility should be delegated to Scotland.''
However, he did not go as far as to back a Scottish parliament,
suggesting instead more responsibility for local government.
The main thrust of his speech was a sweeping discourse on the
perceived wrongs of a too-powerful European Union, and his concerns
about a single currency harming jobs and breeding deep discontent across
Europe.
SEVEN former Tory rebels have pledged to continue to act together in
the Commons to promote their Euro-sceptic cause.
They made their move following Employment minister Michael Portillo's
rebuttal of remarks made by EC president Jacques Santer.
Mr Santer had claimed the EU faced collapse unless Britain accepted
the Social Chapter -- and said that those wishing to opt-out of the
clause would create a Europe ''a la carte''.
0 Seven of the nine Tory backbenchers expelled from the parliamentary
party -- and later readmitted -- issued a statement after a meeting at
Westminster, warning of an inevitable ''bust-up'' with the Commission.
The statement was issued in the names of MPs Sir Teddy Taylor, Teresa
Gorman, Christopher Gill, Richard Shepherd, Tony Marlow, John Wilkinson
and Nicholas Budgen.
They said they would meet regularly to plan tactics.
A spokesman for the MPs said the seven would call themselves ''the
Whipless Group''.

THE Government yesterday closed the door on constitutional change this
side of a General Election, as Scottish Secretary Ian Lang issued a
defiant rallying call to his party faithful.
On a day when those few Tories prepared to own up in public to
pro-devolution sentiments claimed to detect the hint of a change in
policy -- there was much talk of a chink of light on the subject -- the
Scottish Secretary made an uncompromising speech and followed it up with
a clear message.
There was, he insisted afterwards, no suggestion on offer of a
Scottish parliament, nor any area of substantive discussion with party
dissidents on the constitutional issue.
Mr Lang said the subject had been ''pretty well scoured'' by party
policy-makers and there appeared to be no way of reconciling the idea of
a Scottish Parliament with the Conservatives' key aim of maintaining the
union.
Did this mean that any receptiveness to ideas of new consitutional
mechanisms must inevitably fall short of an elected Scottish body? Mr
Lang said that there was no way the Government could see a way of
squaring this circle, making it unlikely that the pro-devolution faction
could come up with anything the party leadership might consider.
His speech carried an uncompromising message of no change in direction
by the Government. Mr Lang opened by admitting that the party had been
through ''a rotten few weeks'' and congratulated the party activists for
keeping their nerve and working to restore their fortunes.
Describing the Union as the cornerstone of all that Scottish Tories
believed in, he said the plans for a devolved assembly with tax-raising
powers would cause chaos, leading to separation.
''Sovereignty is not infinite,'' he said. ''If you put more in
Edinburgh you have less at Westminster. If you have less at Westminster,
Scotland loses out, pushed to the fringe of political life and power.''
The debate on the constitution saw delegates -- only around 100 of
whom were present for the start of the discussion -- vote almost
unanimously for no change.
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, made an impassioned
plea for the constitutional status quo, but departed from his prepared
text to say the Government would be prepared to listen to innovative
ideas.
The only speaker to argue for a Scottish Parliament, Councillor
Christine Richard from Edinburgh, had argued that the question of
devolution would not go away and if the break-up of the UK was to
avoided it would have to be addressed.
Citing past Tory leaders who had been in favour of devolution, she
said: ''What are we afraid of? We are the Scottish Conservative and
Unionist Party -- it is about time we stood up for Scotland.''
Councillor Richard said she was hopeful that the departure from the
script by Lord Mackay was sincere and the party would be open to new
ideas. She accepted that a full jump towards a policy of a Scottish
parliament could not be made in one go, but by stages she hoped the
party would move towards Scottish opinion.
However, Mr Lang insisted that they should ''make bananas -- and their
skins -- a forbidden fruit,'' although by the time he spoke the entire
Cathcart applecart had toppled elesewhere in the building.
Mr Lang sang the praises of his Scottish Office team and responded to
critics: ''I know that there are some in the Party who think it's our
policies that have got us into difficulties and that we whould be busy
changing them. Certainly, as we review our present predicament and plan
ahead, we whould be re-examining all of them.
''But my belief is that we shall find that the central thrust of our
policies is basically sound, where we are sticking to them and where
they flow from our political beliefs.
''It's where we have been driven off them, whether by mistake or by
events, that we have run into problems.''
He said that lower taxes would be brought in as soon as possible,
adding: ''In the economy, in housing, in health, in so many areas Tory
policies are not failing -- they are delivering beyond the dreams of 20
years ago.''
Mr Lang said: ''We need to have faith in our policies, Let's present
them better, explain them better, persuade people better, for it's no
good having poliecies that are right, that are working and succeeding,
unless we can get that message across.''

SCOTS Tories turned to the economy yesterday to drag themselves out of
the public opinion doldrums, painting a picture of record exports and
growing employment (writes Robbie Dinwoodie).
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch said the Scottish Enterprise
network had come of age, while Locate In Scotland now created or
safeguarded 47,000 jobs through inward investment.
He defended the planned merger of Scottish Nuclear and its English
counterpart as a major coup for the Scottish Secretary. ''Despite the
hysterical rantings of George Robertson and his team, over 100 new jobs
will come to Scotland, let alone the opportunities this will open up for
the Scottish financial sector,'' he said.
''The holding company will have an independend Scottish chairman, with
the chairman of Scottish Nuclear becoming one of the two deputy chairman
and the integrity of the two nuclear operating companies maintained. In
the nuclear industry, which every Opposition party wants to see run down
or abolished, we have created a major inward investment for Scotland
which will build for the future.''
Mr Kynoch said there has been a list of good news stories about
Scottish industry which clashed with the impression given by Labour's
''Gordon Brown, the Vincent Price of Scottish politics, preaching doom
and gloom wherever he goes, giving the kiss of death to optimism and
success.''
Prospective candidate for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, Mr
Alister Jack, pointed out that exports at #11,500m were now at record
levels, representing a greater achievement per capita than Japan, while
unemployment levels in Scotland had now dropped below the UK average.
He claimed that Labour's commitment to the Social Chapter, with a
minimum wage and maximum working week, would destroy this competitive
edge.
The European debate saw Labour leader Tony Blair accused of ''a
slavish and uncritical approach to everything that comes out of
Brussels.'' Mr Struan Stevenson, prospective candidate for Dumfries,
called on the Government to take a hard-headed approach to next year's
Inter-Government Conference.
He said: ''Certain EU members who wish to use the IGC as a vehicle for
introducing a federalist constitution for Europe regard Tony Blair and
his socialist chums as poodles who will roll over with their paws in the
air at the mention of political integration of a European superstate.''

TRADE President Michael Heseltine last night announced moves to relax
controls on the Post Office and to let it compete more effectively in
the market.
He set out plans to review the financial regime governing the Post
Office, and emphasised that the Post Office must fund expansion from
increased efficiency, not increased prices.
Mr Heseltine told MPs: ''The measures represent a pragmatic and
balanced package for the Post Office and its customers.''
Shadow Trade President Dr John Cunningham generally welcomed the
''modest'' measures, claiming Labour had been arguing for them for
years.
However, he warned: ''The only way that the public, who overwhelmingly
opposed privatising the Post Office, can ensure its defeat is by
ensuring the defeat of this Government.''
The Post Office welcomed the move saying the door was now open for new
commercial freedom.
Customers and workers would benefit from a ''new culture''.
Mr Heseltine announced to the Commons that the Post Office will
operate under a new regime which will enable more money to be invested
in the service.
The amount of cash the Post Office has to hand over to the Treasury
each year -- the External Finance Limit (EFL) -- will be fixed at half
of the forecast profits of the state-run business.
The amount paid to the Treasury -- currently #4 million a week -- has
fluctuated, one year reaching 101%.
Mr Heseltine, who had to abandon plans to privatise the service last
year, told MPs: ''Whilst no responsible Government could undertake to
ring-fence the Post Office entirely from the pressures of public
spending, I am prepared to agree that in future we will aim to set the
EFL at about half the Post Office's forecast post tax profit.''
The formal limit on capital investment will be lifted, enabling the
Post Office to invest more heavily in technology.
Post Office chairman Michael Heron said the 30-month Government review
on the service's future had only helped foreign competitors.
''The door is now ajar. For the first time we can now see
possibilities for a new, more commercial framework in which the Post
Office can turn its vision into firm plans and establish a new culture
for the benefit of customers.''
The easing of the Treasury constraints would give the Post Office the
chance to plough more money back into the business.
The Communication Workers Union said the announcement was ''long
overdue'' and would safeguard jobs.
''Having spent nearly three years reviewing the Post Office at a cost
of two million pounds in consultants' fees, the Government is reaching a
conclusion which we could have offered at no charge whatsoever.''
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour Trade and Industry spokesman, said the
announcement finally killed off any prospect of privatising the Post
Office.
* Mr Heseltine welcomed an earlier anouncement by the Post Office that
the price of posting a letter within the UK will be frozen until at
least next March.

By GEOFFREY PARKHOUSE, Political Editor
SOFTLY, softly the Tories are trying to rebuild their confidence,
shattered by the electorate over the last month. The tone of this
conference is subdued -- but with the occasional frenzy.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang summoned up a rage about Labour, calling
in aid the spirit of Sir Winston Churchill, not an entirely happy
evocation in view of what the voters did to Churchill in 1945.
It was Labour, not the Tories, who were treating the electorate with
cynical contempt. ''Labour believe in nothing now, except power. Power
at any price. Power at any cost. Power for power's sake. Power
regardless of principle. They will change any policy, make any promise,
abandon any belief in order to achieve it,'' he claimed.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd begged the Tories to be proud of
British achievements in Europe, in Bosnia. The feel-proud factor
extended to the excellence of our armed forces and the wonders achieved
by sillicon glen where hi-tech has replaced heavy industry as Scotland's
No.1.
''Scotland's largest industry today is computers. The renaissance of
the Central Belt following the decline of traditional industries there,
is one of Europe's modern economic miracles,.'' stated Mr Hurd, whose
first novel was not Scottish Tories on the Rocks but Scotch on the
Rocks.
Two things emerged yesterday. Mr Lang made it clear that there is to
be no monkeying about with the Prime Minister's declared stance in
defence of the Union. They think this worked in 1992, and they hope it
might work to save seats in Scotland in two years time.
Mr Hurd declared that the Brussels Commission can chatter on as much
as it likes about abolishing negotiated opt-outs (single currency,
Social Chapter) but there is nothing they can do about it, he said.
Those opt-outs are cast in stone by the Maastricht Treaty.
It was all very decorous as usual until five erstwhile Conservative
chairmen of Cathcart Association barged in with their rumbustious
Declaration of Cathcart.
It is a vigorous, constituency manifesto such as Sir Teddy Taylor used
to use surreptitiously to hold the seat for the Tories against all the
odds until the SNP did for him by advising its people to vote Labour.
Today it is the Prime Minister's job to carry forward this attempt at
rebuilding. Mr Lang has already taken the blame for the local election
results on to the shoulders of the national Government. We are in for
more of this ''backs-to-the-wall'' oratory.
And certainly the Scottish Tories gathered fairly thinly yesterday are
certain of one thing, there's nowhere to go now but up. The Herald's new
System Three opinion poll was beginning to reach their ears -- this
indicating a two point improvement for them in the last month in
Scotland, while Labour has shifted marginally downwards and the SNP
slightly more so.
These people don't want cake, don't want bread -- they'll settle for
crumbs of comfort; which is more than they are getting from polling
samples in the Perth and Kinross by-election, where they look like
running third.
This possibility deeply shocked Mr Hurd yesterday talking after his
platform speech. ''I cannot imagine that Tories in Perthshire would
fancy the very left-wing politics of the SNP.''
After their battering on the hustings throughout mainland Britain,
they lack sufficient sting in their attacks on Mr Tony Blair and his
colleagues. Mr Lang's ''Tony Blair thinks he's Moses -- he went up the
mountain with tablet, and came back down with fudge'' didn't quite set
them rocking in the aisles. Tablet or fudge, the voters seemed to like
it.
He tried again: ''Gordon Brown's like an Old Testament prophet without
a beard. And Robin Cook's like an old bearded prophet without a
testament.'' Lang, a former TV scriptwriter, can tell them awfully well
-- perhaps it was the surroundings that did for them. The Royal Concert
Hall was built for other occasions.
Home Affairs Minister Lord Fraser had a lot of good news to tell on
crime and drug abuse, listing action taken and results proven. He
announced another #24m for the health boards to help them combat drug
misuse and finance the 15 Drug Action teams in Scotland.
However, if Mr Major tells us today how he intends to stick it into Mr
Blair and Labour, perhaps he can sound more convincing than the Tories
did yesterday in their political cut-and-thrust.
Perhaps the modern anti-crime technology which is assisting the police
may be turned against the triumphant socialists.''Automatic fingerprint
recognition'' may be required to pinpoint Blair policy.
And Lord Fraser's Criminal Justice Bill which will deploy DNA
''profiling'' also sounds promising if the Scottish Tories are going to
use the next two years for one of the biggest comebacks of all time.

ONE can expect the minutes of last week's meeting between the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the
Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, to be a model of draughtsmanship when
they are revealed to the public and, in particular, the Opposition's
gaze, next month.
Mr Clarke, bouncy as ever, despite not being cheered to the rafters by
the Scots Tories the day before, told us he was ''his own man'', which
few have doubted, and generally exuded confidence that when the record
comes to be read it will not include sentences with Eddie saying: ''For
heaven's sake, Ken, we've got to put the rate up now to damp down
inflation,'' or Ken replying: ''Do you think I'm off my trolley? Did you
see yesterday's local election results?''
Nor, probably, will there be any record of Mr George suggesting that
it might be just as well to get all the bad news over at once. The
Chancellor did, however, pick his words with rare care when it came to
describing Mr George's view.
He said they were ''entirely agreed'' on the object of policy, i.e.
low inflation, and both believed that that policy ''has been delivered
successfully''.
That really gave no clue as to whether Eddie agreed with him that a
rate rise now could be dispensed with. We shall have to await the
minutes.
One cannot help warming to the Chancellor's cheerful self-confidence
although some of a more sober disposition are worried by a person who
always sounds confident. Mr Clarke was confident he would deliver
inflation at under 2[1/2]% at the end of this Parliament and he had
better be right.
He was helped out yesterday by the inability of the Labour Treasury
team, or rather their disinclination, to say whether he was right or
wrong to freeze the rate. Perhaps they think he was wrong. The Sketch
doesn't know. But if they said so, Mr Clarke would be right in there
with a ''So Labour wants higher interest rates do they'' type of remark.
And if they think he was right, they are hardly going to say that.
That's not what Oppositions are there for.
Mr Clarke has clearly briefed his colleagues to make a point of this
Trappist silence. He called the Shadow team ''stuffed ducks'' and liked
the sound of it so much that he called that them again.
Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield -- Con.), a champion of business
and construction, opined that if these two were doing well no other
economic indicators really mattered.
Mr Clarke is not one of the more academic Chancellors but he could not
avoid saying that that seemed to be going a bit far.
He denied an Opposition allegation that the nuclear and railway
privatisations were basically being carried out for cash to fund
pre-election bribes with the same cheerful authority with which he had
asserted that he and Eddie were very close to being economic Siamese
twins.
Mr Major, following on, sang a paeon of praise to the achievements of
his own administration -- low inflation, investment in exports up,
unemployment down. When have the Labour Party in government ever had a
record like that he cried proudly.
Mr Tony Banks (Newham North-east -- Labour) his former football
spectating buddy, deflatingly reminded him that the electorate, faced
with this string of triumphs, had just given his party its worst ever
drubbing.
No minute ever drafted could get round that.

THE five men responsible for the Declaration of Cathcart, which has
called on the Government to change course, includes Conservative Party
members who have never been backward in coming forward to criticise the
party's hierarchy over controversial proposals such as VAT on domestic
fuel, privatising Scotland's water, and rail privatisation.
The five signatories, who are all past chairmen of the Cathcart
Conservative Association is made up of:
COUNCILLOR John Young, OBE -- one of Scotland's longest-serving Tories
-- has been outspoken in his criticisms of the Government's plans for
imposing VAT on domestic fuel and the privatisation of Scotland's water
and sewerage services.
Councillor Young, 64, described the VAT on domestic fuel as an
''iniquitous and totally unnecessary tax''. He has served as a
councillor with Glasgow Corporation and then Glasgow District Council
since 1964. He has been deputy lieutenant of Glasgow since 1981,
chairman of the Association of Scottish Conservative Councillors since
1991, and vice-chairman of the Scottish Tory Reform Group since 1993.
JACK Addison, 62, is the current president of the Cathcart
Conservative Association and a past chairman. He stood unsuccessfully as
a Conservative candidate in Giffnock North in last month's local
elections.
He supported ''100%'', post-election sentiments expressed by former
Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart that the Tories' poor showing was
a punishment for ignoring the electorate.
ALASTAIR Mackenzie, is deputy chairman of the West of Scotland
Conservatives, a past chairman of the Cathcart constituency, and also a
member of the Scottish Tory Reform Group.
Mr Mackenzie, who is in his 60s, is a past chairman of the City of
Glasgow Conservative Association. He has gone on record as saying that
he knows of no members of the Scottish Tory Reform Group or Scottish
Conservative Party who do not strongly support the maintenance of the
Union.
KENNETH Ross, 46, a Glasgow chartered accountant, is a past chairman
of Cathcart Conservative Association. A former chairman of Edinburgh
University Conservative Association, he fought two seats for the
Conservatives at General Elections in Kilmarnock, where he was born, and
in Galloway.
GEORGE Dallas, 71, is a past chairman of Cathcart Conservative
Association. The retired quantity surveyor was president of the
association for 10 years from 1983-93.

A JUDGE yesterday upheld a Government ''gagging order'' on some of the
evidence due to be given by former police chief John Stalker in a civil
action.
Mr Justice Owen agreed that the evidence in question could affect
national security.
However, he said he would allow other parts of Mr Stalker's proposed
evidence to be given -- despite objections to it by Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew.
The judge delivered his 35-minute judgment at the High Court in
Liverpool yesterday.
A civil action is being brought by former wealthy businessman Kevin
Taylor, 63, who claims that he was maliciously prosecuted by the then
chief constable of Greater Manchester, Sir James Anderton.
Mr Taylor, of Accrington, Lancashire, was charged with defrauding the
Co-op Bank of #250,000 but the case collapsed in 1990 amid allegations
that the police fabricated evidence.
He claims the police concocted the charge to discredit his friend,
former Deputy Chief Constable Stalker, who was at the centre of a row
when he was removed from an inquiry into the alleged ''shoot to kill''
policy in Northern Ireland in 1986.
Sir Patrick dramatically intervened in the action on Tuesday when he
issued a public immunity certificate -- or ''gagging order'' -- on some
of Mr Stalker's evidence due to be heard.
He objected to it on two grounds -- national security and public
interest.
Mr Justice Owen told the court that, based on earlier judicial
rulings, evidence which could affect national security should not be
given by Mr Stalker.
On Tuesday, Ministers feared that some evidence by Mr Stalker could
''prejudice or impede'' current efforts to end terrorist violence
permanently.
The judge said: ''Where the Secretary of State claims immunity for the
protection of the national interest, he must be allowed such
protection.''
He added: ''I am conscious that a judge should have in mind the
necessity to be able to justify his decisions to the public at large.
''To act contrary to this certificate would be irresponsible and I
won't do so.''
However, he considered that some of Mr Stalker's evidence -- although
objected to by Sir Patrick -- could be heard.
He said: ''In fairness, Mr Taylor should be able to present such
evidence to the court if national interest is not concerned.''
Mr Stalker is due to give evidence early in the action, which is
expected to last up to 10 months.
Mr Taylor is pressing on with his case for damages although Greater
Manchester Police Authority insurers offered him #625,000 to settle out
of court.
The case was adjourned until next Tuesday, when Mr Roger Farley QC,
representing Mr Taylor, is expected to make his opening address.

<HEADLINE>Hidden extras can double holiday costs</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978436338</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE average British family of four may pay as much as #4295 for a
two-week holiday in the sun, it was claimed yesterday.
Hidden extras can nearly double the price of the annual summer break,
with the real cost of the holiday being 82% more than it appears at face
value.
A report, by Malibu Suncare, suggests a family of four which pays
#2356 for flights, accommodation, and spending money could spend a
further #1939 on items such as passports, car parking, new clothes,
toiletries, and car hire.
A spokesman explained: ''Unless you are planning to move home or buy a
new car, your holiday package will probably represent the biggest single
spend in the year.
''People use holidays as an excuse to buy lots of new things like
clothes.
''It takes an extremely well-disciplined person not to look upon the
fortnight prior to a holiday as a time to buy a few new items for the
wardrobe.''
The report says accommodation and spending money accounts for 55% of
holiday costs, with other costs making up the rest.
Other sundries which boost the total bill include cosmetics, swimwear,
sun glasses, presents, and local travel and duty-free.
The report's estimates are based on a two-week package deal for a
family of four in Torremolinos, including flights, half-board
accommodation, and transfers between resort and airport.
It came in at #2356 but, before leaving the travel agents, a further
#123.80 was added on for holiday insurance, the first of a series of
additional costs once the holiday plans have been finalised.
A spokesman for Malibu said: ''These costs do add up but savings can
be made by using items year after year and even borrowing from family or
friends.''

<TEXT>
A WOMAN who wants to bring a rare private prosecution against three
men she claims gang-raped her will have to wait to find out if she will
get the go-ahead.
Appeal judges yesterday reserved their decision in the action and said
they would give a written ruling at a later date, yet to be fixed.
They heard a claim by a defence counsel for one of the men that there
was evidence which appeared to show that the alleged victim had invited
them to her home before the alleged incident.
Mrs Ann Paton, QC, counsel for one of the men, said the defence had
two witnesses, aged 11 and 13 at the time of the incident, who, on her
information, were present when a conversation took place between the
woman and her alleged attackers.
Mrs Paton said those young witnesses could relate what was said during
the conversation in the street and what could be taken from it,
including a possible implication relating to an understanding that there
might be sexual activity.
However, Mrs Paton said it was now almost three years since the date
of the alleged rape.
She argued that with witnesses who were aged 11 and 13 at the time,
for three years to elapse was a lengthy period. ''It would be a very
unsafe procedure to be asking these people what happened three years ago
and the details of it, on a matter of such importance,'' she said.
Mrs Paton submitted that it would be oppressive if the Appeal Court
was to allow the men to stand trial now through a private prosecution.
The 25-year-old woman has alleged that she was raped at her home in
Dunfermline in September 1992 by Mr Alistair Forsyth, 24, Mr Graeme
Naismith, 24, and Mr Christopher Blount, 22, all from the Fife town.
The case was set for trial at the High Court in Kirkcaldy in September
1993 but, after an essential Crown witness failed to turn up, Lord Clyde
refused to grant an extension to the 12-month time limit and the
proceedings collapsed.
The woman has now raised an action to try to bring a private
prosecution.
If her plea to be allowed to go ahead is granted by the appeal judges,
the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Ross, Lord Marnoch, and Lord Brand, it
would be only the third private prosecution this century in Scotland.
The Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Mr Andrew Hardie QC, who
appeared for the woman, urged the judges to allow the private
prosecution to go ahead.
He said rape had always been regarded in the law of Scotland as a very
serious crime and the public had a legitimate expectation that it would
be prosecuted.
Mr Hardie disputed that there be any oppression aimed at the three men
in taking them to trial.
He argued it was not a case where a prosecution against them had come
as a surprise as they had been indicted by the Crown previously.
''They have prepared for trial already and it is difficult to see how
any delay can have caused any prejudice to them,'' he said.
The two young witnesses had already given statements and concerns
about their recollection did not create the sort of prejudice that ought
to stop a trial taking place, he argued.

<TEXT>
A BATTLE of Britain pilot was laid to rest yesterday -- 54 years after
crashing in his Spitfire.
Sergeant John Gilders was listed missing, presumed dead, when his
aircraft dived into a field from 20,000ft on a routine patrol with RAF
41 (fighter) Squadron over Kent in February 1941.
The 21-year-old pilot's remains were not discovered until the crash
site, at Chilham Beeches, was excavated in April last year.
Sgt Gilders was accorded full military honours at yesterday's funeral.
Six airmen carried his flag draped coffin into the Guards Chapel at
Alexander Barracks, Pirbright, Surrey.
The chaplain, the Rev David Osborn, said: ''In a week that has seen so
many moving and appropriate symbols of commemoration, we gather to give
thanks for the sacrifice of one young pilot.
''We give thanks for his dedication, courage, and loyalty. We
acknowledge the sacrifice John made so others could have life, hope, and
freedom.''
After the short service, the coffin was taken by hearse to nearby
Brookwood Military Cemetery along a route lined by the Queen's Colour
Squadron.
As the coffin was lowered into a grave, a lone bugler sounded Last
Post.
The pilot's father, Mr Garnham Gilders, who died in 1969, had searched
in vain for his son's remains.
Among the floral tributes was a wreath of white chrysanthemums
fashioned into RAF wings, from Mr Mark Kirby, 25, the war relic-hunter
who finally found the pilot's remains.
He was later prosecuted -- then conditionally discharged -- for
exhuming the body without an MoD licence, despite having permission from
Sgt Gilders's family.

<TEXT>
A CHILD-MINDER was jailed for four years yesterday for killing an
eight-month-old baby -- the second child to die in her care.
Susan Cawthorne, 42, of Helmton Drive, Woodseats, Sheffield, had
pleaded not guilty to the murder of baby Helen Sangar in October 1993.
A jury at Sheffield Crown Court unanimously found her guilty of
manslaughter.
Passing sentence, Mr Justice Holland said that on the evidence he was
''entirely satisfied that, in response to her persistent crying, you
shook her so hard she was immediately rendered blind in the left eye and
in a relatively short time her breathing stopped and her heart stopped.
''It remained stopped until it was restored by the accident and
emergency department at hospital and I am entirely satisfied that in the
same attack on baby Helen, in some fashion never yet explained, you
broke her right arm -- and all that occurred when as a child-minder you
were looking after her safety.''
The judge told Cawthorne that it did not need him to spell out just
how serious this case was.
''From the outset, I suspect you have appreciated it is so serious
that only a custodial sentence can be justified. I can see no basis
whatsoever for suspending the sentence,'' he said.
The judge said he accepted immediately there was no intention to kill
baby Helen and there was no intention to cause her serious bodily harm.
He also accepted that Helen was not an easy baby to deal with and that
the sentence he was passing would bear heavily on Cawthorne's family
who, he said, had distinguished themselves by their loyalty.
The judge also accepted that the matter had weighed heavily on the
defendant.
''But for the rest I can see no mitigation at all,'' he said.
''The sort of offence I am dealing with here is not unknown to this
court.
''It is usually committed by very young parents of either sex who are
inexperienced, uncommitted, and under stress and have no idea how to
deal with children.
''But you are a registered child-minder of experience and this happens
with a baby in your care.''
The judge added: ''It goes further than that in that you had past
experience of a disaster and you have not learned at all from that
experience.''
The judge also criticised Cawthorne for lying about the circumstances.
Earlier, Cawthorne's counsel Mrs Helena Kennedy, QC, pleaded for a
suspended sentence.
Mrs Kennedy said: ''It is a recurring nightmare which does not just
happen at night. Her remorse is considerable and it has not stopped.''
Referring to the death 10 years ago of baby Leila Ipakchi, 2, while in
Cawthorne's care, Mrs Kennedy said: ''There is no question in anybody's
mind that the coroner's verdict was right, that this was a terrible
accident,'' she said.
Helen's mother, Miss Susan Alston, 35, sat only a few feet from the
dock as the judge passed sentence. Her partner, Mr Andrew Sangar, 28,
sat next to her in the public gallery.
After the hearing, he said they were satisfied with a custodial
sentence and added: ''We are very pleased with the judge's comments in
summing up and the length of sentence is what we had been led to
expect.''
Asked if they felt they now knew the truth of what happened on the day
Helen died, Miss Alston, who is expecting twins shortly, said: ''I think
I have my own ideas in my own mind but obviously we will probably never
really know and that does not help.''
Meanwhile, an inquiry has been ordered by senior social workers in
Sheffield who failed to tell Helen's parents about the death of Leila
Ipakchi.
Sheffield's director of social services, Mr Martin Manby, said:
''There was no police prosecution and no suspicious circumstances. There
was nothing to start the alarm bells ringing.''

Frankfurt, Thursday
NICK Leeson, the man blamed for the collapse of Barings Bank, today
told a German judge he would not be voluntarily extradited to Singapore,
where he faces a dozen charges linked to his risky dealings.
Frankfurt prosecutor Hans-Hermann Eckert said Leeson was told he would
stay in jail until a formal review of the 12 charges against him by a
high court in Frankfurt.
Eckert said Leeson appeared calm during the 30-minute private hearing
held in central Frankfurt.
''He appears healthy,'' Eckert said. ''He even made some jokes with
his attorney.''
Leeson has so far been held for more than two months in a Frankfurt
jail where he spends his days working in the prison workshop to earn
around #4.
He suffered a setback in his battle against Singapore's extradition
move last week when a regional high court ruled that he should remain in
jail pending the formal review of the charges.
The Frankfurt court ruled Singapore had presented sufficient evidence
in support of its claim that Leeson forged documents for a fictitious
deal with a Wall Street trading firm.

From ALISON PUCHY Perth, Thursday
AN outback Australian sheep station may have been the testing site for
the deadly gas attack on Tokyo's subway in March, Australian police said
today after finding sarin gas traces in sheep carcasses.
Banjawarn Station in west Australia was owned between 1993 and August
1994 by the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) sect, suspected of being
involved in the subway attack that killed 12 people and injured more
than 5000.
Australian federal police said toxicology tests on 24 sheep carcasses
found on the property revealed traces of methylphosphonic acid, which
occurs when sarin breaks down.
Traces of the acid were also found in soil around the dead sheep,
which were left in a remote part of the 500,000 acre property.
Police refused to directly link the sheep deaths with the Tokyo gas
attack but said the chemist who performed the toxicology tests had done
so.
''The chemist who prepared the report is fairly definite that the
linkage is positive,'' federal police assistant commissioner Alan Mills
told a Perth news conference.
Banjawarn Station, about 745 miles northeast of Perth, is now regarded
as a crime scene and has been secured by police, Mills said.
Two Japanese police officers were in Australia last week to help the
investigation, a federal police spokeswoman told Reuters.
Australian police raised the possibility of charging the sect members
who visited the property in 1993, including cult leader Shoko Asahara,
with a ''foreign incursion''.
''It means they could have been involved in hostile activity which
would cause fear and danger to residents in a foreign country,'' he
said, adding that such charges could be prosecuted in Japan.
Sect members arrived at Perth airport in September 1993 and were
arrested for carrying hydrochloric acid, in containers marked hand soap,
in their luggage.
Two of the sect members, who said the chemical was for gold
prospecting, were fined. Banjawarn Station is near a gold mine.
Four days after the Tokyo gas attack, Australian police flew to
Banjawarn Station, where they discovered some chemicals.
Tests found the chemicals could have been used for mineral processing
or to make an irritant gas, but not a nerve gas like sarin.--Reuter.

Alzheimer's, said Professor Kalevi Pyorala today.

From NICHOLAS DOUGHTY
United Nations, Thursday
A SPECIAL UN conference today made a treaty to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons permanent with a landmark decision extending a pact that
has underpinned global arms control for 25 years.
After weeks of intense debate over nuclear dangers in the post-Cold
War world and a last-minute delay due to objections from Syria and Iran,
the conference agreed to extend indefinitely the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT).
The agreement, signed by 178 nations, came into force in 1970 and had
to be renewed by the end of this week. A full session of the NPT review
conference did so without a vote.
''It is so decided,'' said conference president Jayantha Dhanapala of
Sri Lanka, to loud applause at UN headquarters.
The conference also agreed to measures strengthening the treaty and
passed a resolution calling on all states in the Middle East to join the
agreement, an indirect reference to Israel's nuclear programme.
The NPT allows only five declared nuclear powers -- the United States,
Russia, China, France and Britain -- as part of a treaty bargain with
non-nuclear states. Nations without nuclear arms renounce them for good,
while weapons states promise to disarm and develop peaceful nuclear
cooperation in other areas under international safeguards.
Israel, India and Pakistan have all refused to sign the pact and are
all widely suspected of having the bomb.
The conference appealed to all states with ''unsafeguarded nuclear
facilities'' to join, but Israel reaffirmed today that it had no
intention of doing so as long as it feels Iran and other countries
threaten its existence.
Frequent disputes during the month-long NPT conference have shown that
nuclear weapons remain a sensitive and difficult issue in the post-Cold
War world, almost 50 years after the first and only weapons were
detonated over Japan.
Iran protested over US attempts to block its purchase of Russian
nuclear reactors. North Korea, suspected of developing nuclear arms even
though it has signed the NPT, said it was being pressured and withdrew
from the conference.
The final hurdle was cleared late yesterday, when Arab nations, under
strong US pressure, backed away from demands that the conference condemn
Israel's nuclear programme, settling for a weaker statement on the
Middle East.
Many developing countries have accused the nuclear powers of failing
to disarm fast enough. They have pressed for more frequent reviews of
the pact, a formal halt to nuclear testing, better security assurances
and an end to the production of fissile material used to make bombs.
The head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency,
responsible for safeguards under the treaty, welcomed the extension but
said much work remained to be done, particularly by nuclear weapons
states.
The US and its Western allies, arguing that missile arsenals have
already been slashed since the end of East-West conflict, were initially
reluctant to make concessions but agreed to do so to get universal
support for NPT extension. They have reaffirmed the treaty's ultimate
goal of a nuclear-free world, although there is no fixed timetable so
this is likely to remain a distant dream.
Nuclear powers also agreed to complete a treaty banning nuclear tests
next year and to start talks on ending the production of fissile
material.
But the likelihood of a test ban treaty being put in place by 1996 is
in question. Outgoing French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted
today as saying France would probably have to carry out more
tests.--Reuter.

LESLEY WROUGHTON
Orkney, South Africa, Thursday
MORE than 100 miners are feared to have died in one of South Africa's
biggest gold mines when a runaway underground train plunged down a
vertical shaft on to a packed lift, mine officials said today.
''Regrettably, there is very little chance that anyone has survived,''
Dick Fisher, regional general manager at Vaal Reefs Mine, near the town
of Orkney, 95 miles southwest of Johannesburg told Reuters.
Fisher later said steel safety blocks which should have prevented the
12-tonne train from plunging down the Number Two shaft were missing at
the time of last night's accident.
''An investigation conducted soon after the accident could find no
sign of two steel blocks . . . which a safety officer said were there
last week,'' he told provincial government ministers.
He offered no explanation and said several other safety devices also
failed
Mines minister Pik Botha, who flew to Orkney from Cape Town, said an
independent inquiry needed to be called, although a mine and union
investigation was already under way.
''It is too serious (not to) . . . From my point of view it is a
national disaster,'' he told reporters.
Rescuers today worked their way along a shaft to the site of the
accident, 7550ft beneath the surface and started to bring bodies up,
Fisher said. One hundred and six people, South Africans and Mozambicans,
were missing.
Asked about his feelings over reports that Mozambicans were among the
dead, President Joaquim Chissano, who is visiting South Africa, said:
''When there are disasters like this . . . we always feel sorry. We
regret the lives that have been lost.''
A mine official said the first remains recovered from the pit were:
''Body bags of human flesh''.
James Motlatsi, president of the mainly black National Union of
Mineworkers, said there was little chance of finding survivors. A
provisional list of names of the missing men identified most, if not not
all, as black.
''Pieces of flesh were scattered all over the floor as a two-floor
mining carriage (the lift) was crushed into a one-floor tin box,''' the
South African Press Association quoted Motlatsi as saying at the mine.
The disaster happened when the locomotive and a carriage it was
pulling -- used to ferry men, equipment and ore along underground
galleries -- plunged down Shaft Two on top of the double-tiered lift
cage carrying about 100 men, said Fisher.
''It appears that the loco went through various safety devices and
jumped a rail which changed its direction and it then fell down the
shaft. At the same time, the double-decker man carriage was going down
the shaft.
''The loco caught up with the man carriage and detached the rope. The
man carriage then plunged 450 metres to the bottom of the shaft,''
Fisher said.
The train driver jumped to safety. He was under sedation in a mine
hospital.
Motlatsi said negligence was to blame.
''Nothing like that can be anything more than negligence. The safety
mechanisms were not in place,'' he told reporters.
President Nelson Mandela told a news conference near Johannesburg:
''It's a very shocking matter.''
Mandela's ruling African National Congress called for a national day
of mourning, saying it was time for ''new and stringent regulation to
bring the sorry train of death and injury to an end''.
James Duncan, of mine managers Anglo American Corporation said work at
the mine, South Africa's second largest in terms of production, would be
seriously affected.
Fisher said Shaft Two, which accounted for 15% of annual production,
would be closed to mining operations for at least three weeks.
Workers who were travelling in a double-tiered lift were crushed to
death after the locomotive crashed down the shaft.
It snapped the cable and sent the lift plunging 1500ft to the pit
bottom. Such was the force of the impact that the steel lift was
squeezed into half its normal size.
One official described it as a ''one-floor tin box''.
The mangled bodies, wrapped in blankets and plastic bags, were taken
for indentification into a small office at the dusty entrance of Shaft
Five at the mine.
''They are body bags of human flesh,'' a mine official said as remains
were carried past by grim-faced stretcher bearers.
As the first black bags were brought out, more were being sent down to
rescuers working 7550ft underground. Anxious miners coming off shift
waited behind a cordon to see if any colleagues had survived.
Rescue workers have to walk two miles underground from Shaft Five to
Shaft Two, where the crushed lift cage is lying under the locomotive and
an empty carriage.
The locomotive driver, who leapt to safety seconds before his train
plunged down the shaft, was under sedation at a mine hospital.

and social issues, the conflict in Bosnia, and the migration within
Europe. The group's secretary, Labour MP for Glasgow Central, Mr Mike
Watson, said the talks would be followed by a tour taking in some of the
city's housing schemes, in a bid to exhange information on ways of
tackling housing problems.

From JOHN CHIAHEMEN, Thursday
INTERNATIONAL medical experts fought to contain an outbreak of the
rare but deadly Ebola virus in Zaire today but doctors feared it had
spread to a second town in the sprawling central African country.
The government declared Kikwit, site of the first outbreak, a disaster
zone and slapped a quarantine order on the town of 500,000 people.
The governor of Kinshasa, meanwhile, decreed exceptional measures to
shield the Zairean capital and its five million inhabitants from the
virus, which induces a form of haemorrhagic fever for which there is no
cure or vaccine.
''I have barred all movement of people into Kinshasa from
(neighbouring) Bandundu (province),'' Governor Bernadin Mungul Diaka
told Reuters in his office.
Officials say the virus, which triggered an exodus from the hospital
in Kikwit, has killed at least 28 people in the town.
But the World Health Organisation in Geneva said its experts in Zaire
were investigating 20 suspected Ebola cases among staff at a hospital in
the town of Masengo, 60 miles away on the road to Kinshasa.
Health officials have reported at least 90 deaths in the Kikwit area,
about 310 miles from Kinshasa, but it was not immediately clear whether
Ebola fever had killed them all. Earlier, officials and health workers
blamed some of the deaths on a separate outbreak of bloody diarrhoea in
the town.
The government and the WHO confirmed that Ebola was the killer virus
in Kikwit.
Senior health ministry official Bompenda Bonkumo told state television
last night the virus had killed 28 people in Kikwit area. He made no
mention of other deaths but said the virus, which health experts say may
be behind other mystery epidemics in Africa, surfaced in Kikwit on March
27.
Three Italian nuns are among 11 dead health workers, who are
particularly at risk from Ebola, which, like the better-known Aids virus
HIV, is transmitted by blood or bodily fluids.
A team of international medical experts, from WHO, CDC in Atlanta, the
Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Institute for Virology in
South Africa, have arrived in Zaire.
The virus, named after a river in north Zaire, causes fever,
haemorrhage and vomiting. It normally affects monkeys, pigs and other
animals, but sometimes jumps to humans.--Reuter.

FORMER Solicitor General Tom Dawson QC, became Scotland's latest judge
yesterday, taking the title of Lord Dawson.
At the age of 46, he is the youngest judge to be appointed to the
Scottish Bench since Lord Wheatley in 1954.
The son of a bank manager, Lord Dawson was called to the Bar in 1973
and became a QC in 1986. He was appointed Solicitor General in 1992.
He is married with two sons and his family were present at Parliament
House yesterday to see him sworn in as a judge by Lord Hope, the Lord
President.
The Government also announced yesterday that Mr Donald Macfadyen QC,
currently Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, will be appointed as a
judge to replace Lord Morton, who died last month.
Mr Macfadyen, 49, was called to the Bar in 1969, served as an
Advocate-depute from 1979 to 1982 and took silk in 1983.
He has served as part-time chairman of the Medical Appeal Tribunals
and Vaccine Damage Tribunals since 1989 and was elected vice-dean in
1992.
He lists child-care law as one of his special interests and was
counsel to the Orkney Sex Abuse Inquiry. He was appointed a temporary
judge last year.

From PATRICK BROGAN, Washington, Thursday
FOUR people who were injured in the Oklahoma City bombing are suing
the British chemical giant ICI because it sold fertiliser that may have
been used to make the bomb.
Their attorney is Johnnie Cochran, who is the lead lawyer for O J
Simpson in his murder trial in Los Angeles.
The suit is against one of ICI's American subsidiaries, ICI Explosives
USA Inc.
There are four plaintiffs, each claiming $50,000, but Mr Cochran wants
them to be the lead plaintiffs in a class action suit: 167 were killed
in the explosion and over 400 injured, so the costs to the chemical
company could, in theory, be very large.
The bomb was concocted of ammonium nitrate and petrol. The chemical is
the basic ingredient in most fertilisers. The suit alleges that ICI
failed to take steps to ensure that it could not be used to make
explosives.
The Oklahoma City bomb was made of two tons of ammonium nitrate.
Meanwhile, the second suspect charged in the bombing, Terry Nichols,
is being moved to Oklahoma City.
His 12-year old son, who lives with Nichols's ex-wife in Las Vegas,
said on television last night that he had been with his father shortly
before the bombing, and that the two of them made small quantities of
explosives and set them off, for the fun of it.
News reports state that Nichols has told police that he drove the
truck that was used in the bombing from Junction City, Kansas, 250 miles
south to Oklahoma City, just before the bombing.

THE decision to award a lucrative commission for a major new TV series
to a London-based independent was defended by BBC Scotland yesteray.
Mr Ken MacQuarrie, head of Gaelic and features, said the contract for
the 10-week leisure pursuits show, The Big Country, had been awarded to
the company which had offered ''the best idea, the best approach, and
the best quality''.
He added: ''We are delighted with the result. It will be a great
success and will prove to be excellent for the Scottish independent
community.
''The commission was won by the best tender in a fair contest.''
The contract was awarded to Wall To Wall Television, one of the top
English independent producers. It is run by a Scot, Mr Alex Graham.
The firm opened an office in Glasgow before the BBC Scotland contract
was discussed and the new programme was made entirely in Scotland with a
Scottish film crew.
However, according to a Sunday newspaper report, the decision has
caused ''disquiet'' in the industry in Scotland. One unsuccessful
bidder, unnamed in the story, was quoted as saying that it had left ''a
bad taste in the independent sector''.
Mr Graham, speaking at the publicity launch of the new programme in
Glasgow yesterday, said: ''We were one of 15 companies who tendered for
the commission and we spent #5000 or #6000 developing our proposals. We
have a Scottish show, made by Scottish talent, and with Scottish
presenters. Wall To Wall is here in Glasgow to stay.''
The Big Country, which is to be presented by Dougie Vipond and Jenni
Falconer, will be a weekly guide to leisure pursuits and sports in
Scotland, focusing on the more peculiar and exciting. The first in the
series is broadcast a week today.

<TEXT>
ANTISOCIAL behaviour and suicides among young people stem from a lack
of jobs and hope, a spokesman for probation officers said yesterday.
Mr Roger Statham, social policy and employment spokesman for the
Association of Chief Officers of Probation, said the despair of such
youngsters was a ''national tragedy''.
Mr Statham, also Cleveland's chief probation officer, was commenting
on two new reports. One, from the Crime and Social Policy Committee,
calls for support and education for parents, more opportunities for
young people, and a lead role for local authorities in building safer
communities.
It states that the rise in crime over the past 20 years ''is due as
much to increases in inequality, unemployment, and social deprivation as
it is to changes in individual morality and a reduction in personal
responsibility''.
The other report, by probation officers, claims young men on probation
are at high risk of suicide. According to research in Calderdale and
Kirklees, Yorkshire, one-third of offenders on probation deliberately
harmed themselves -- 70% of these said they had made a serious bid to
kill themselves.
Mr Statham said around 75% of probationers are out of work, while
two-thirds of 17-year-old offenders had fallen through the benefits net
and received no regular income.
Last week, launching a three-year plan to tackle crime in the
mid-1990s, he called for four-year apprenticeship schemes targeted at
young people in deprived communities to be introduced alongside job
creation schemes.

UNIVERSITY chiefs are calling on the Glasgow-based Student Loans
Company to reimburse them for the ''real'' cost of processing loan
certificates.
In its submission to the Public Expenditure Survey, the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals says it is subsidising the company
because it receives only #4 for each correctly-completed eligibility
certificate.
It says universities should be reimbursed at the rate of #8 for each
certificate because the sum reflects the full cost of administration and
paperwork involved in their completion.
The company rejected the CVCP's case. An official said: ''We base this
level of payment on an assessment of the time taken by a typical higher
education institution to process a certificate.
''The time commitment varies from institution to institution but, in
general, we believe that in a well-organised institution this is a fair
and equitable payment.''
The CVCP submission also calls for:
* A halt in the decline in funding per student.
* More funding to offer early retirement, attract new blood, retain
high-quality staff, and improve the career prospects of researchers.
* More than #1000m in funding to deal with the backlog in building
maintenance.
* A further #840m for capital investment in such areas as extra
library, lecture, and laboratory spaces.
Meanwhile, student leaders in Scotland last night called on Lothian
Regional Council to re-think a move to end the funding of bursaries for
students who wish to study Scottish Certificate of Education courses,
such as Highers, at further education colleges.
The National Union of Students claimed the decision by the local
authority, which had previously stated its aim was to encourage students
to stay on at school, would hit many students who had left and who
wanted to continue their education as adult returners.
Around 200 students in Lothian region will be affected by the move,
which has been criticised by Mr Douglas Trainer, president of the NUS
Scotland.
He said they had been sympathetic towards the regions in view of the
financial restraints they faced but this measure would close down
opportunities for those in Lothian.
''There are many legitimate reasons why funding only school students
is unacceptable and we would urge the region to think through the
implications of this move.''
The NUS Scotland said Highers continued to be the standard entrance
qualifications for universities in Scotland and also opened the door to
other opportunities.
Students would now have to study part time, or at schools, with no
support from the region.
''Lothian region is the only council to have taken this step,
alongside other measures, in a bid to make savings of #1m. Students from
Lothian are going to miss out on the opportunities that are open to
students in other regions.
''It has been claimed students will be advised on alternative courses
but it is clear that, unless students are prevented from studying, no
savings will be made.
''NUS Scotland remains opposed to any measures that mean educational
opportunities depend more on where students live than on their ability
to study.''

A #100,000 project to tackle truancy and improve pupils' school
qualifications has been launched by the Scottish Office and the Quality
in Education centre at Strathclyde University, Glasgow.
It is believed the project will be jointly funded at a level of
#50,000 a year, for two years.
The bulk will go on the salary and on-costs for a project director,
whose job will be to identify good practice in raising young people's
motivation, commitment, and school achievements.
The job will also involve finding ways to use good practice to support
schools with significant truancy problems.
It is possible the job may go as a secondment to someone working in
school, perhaps in an attendance or social education unit.
Professor John MacBeath, co-director of the QIE centre, said
yesterday: ''There is a vulnerable, disenfranchised group of kids whose
achievement suffers because they do not attend school.
''But I do not believe in herding them into school to do meaningless
work just to boost attendance figures.''
The Scottish Office published data in January which showed that
secondary schools had an authorised and unauthorised absence rate of
12%, equal to each pupil being absent for four out of the 38 weeks in
the school year. Officials said they were worried about the
''surprisingly high'' level of authorised absence.
At the time, Scottish Office Education Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton ruled out the use of social factors in compiling
comparative tables of attendance and absence figures.
However, Professor MacBeath said yesterday that there were undeniable
links between attendance and social background, as there were between
social class and achievement.
However, the Government and QIE researchers agree that performance is
linked to school attendance.

THE Troll gas production platform -- the largest structure ever to be
moved by man across the face of the earth -- began its epic journey
yesterday when it was towed out to the North Sea and into the record
books.
The 1500ft tall edifice was inched from its moorings in a fjord near
Stavanger in Norway by 10 powerful tugs.
It is expected to take six days to tow the half-submerged platform on
the 175-mile journey to its final location in the Troll gas field, 50
miles north of Bergen.
Troll will be positioned to develop Europe's largest offshore gas
field, in the northern waters of the North Sea where 100ft waves have
been recorded.
''Since the beginning of time, many people have claimed they built the
eighth wonder of the world,'' said Mr Hans Meijer, managing director of
developers Norske Shell.
''I think today Shell can justifiably join that queue.''
The Troll field is due to come on stream next year. Contracts have
already been signed with several major European gas buyers.
When it reaches the field, the platform will be lowered until it sits
on the seabed, leaving only the tops of its four shafts and the deck
visible above the surface.
The Troll field was discovered in 1979 and contains 1300 billion cubic
metres of gas. It lies under 1000ft of water.
The giant oil platform, which cost #500,000m to build and weighs over
one million tonnes, has been designed to last 70 years.
It will be the first installation of its type to have a mains electric
supply and will be manned by a crew of 20 initially, rising to 108 when
it goes into full production.
0 Its topsides are relatively small because, unlike conventional
platforms, virtually all processing functions will be carried out
onshore.
Gas will be sent through two 40-mile pipelines to the land-based
processing plant, now being built near Bergen, to provide up to 10% of
Europe's requirements.

<TEXT>
The majority of politicians and civil servants are not tainted by the
sleaze factor, writes BENEDICT BROGAN, Political Reporter. However,
there is a need to set out the boundaries between acceptable and
unacceptable behaviour.
ANY evaluation of the impact of Lord Nolan's recommendations on how to
keep British politics honest should be prefaced by a simple truth: our
politics are not particularly corrupt, our standards in public life are
reasonably high, and our politicians and civil servants are, on the
whole, honest people doing their best to serve both constituent and
tax-payer.
Nolan makes the point in his summary: ''We cannot say conclusively
that standards of behaviour in public life have declined. We can say
that conduct in public life is more rigorously scrutinised than it was
in the past, that the standards which the public demands remain high,
and that the great majority of people in public life meet those high
standards.''
That out of the way, it is also useful to remember that of the 17
Tories who -- by the last count -- have had to leave the Government over
headline allegations of sleaze, only seven were accused of what could be
interpreted as corruption. The rest fell victim to a variety of personal
and sex scandals which say much about the public's obsession with the
morals of others, but little about the probity of the politicians
involved.
Defenders of the status quo like to to point to Italy or France, where
politicians and civil servants have been arrested, jailed and charged
with corruption on a scale that makes accepting #1000 to ask a few
questions seem distinctly unambitious. But recognition that things are
worse elsewhere and not so bad here does not draw the sting from Nolan's
tail: urgent remedial action is needed to address the confusion
obscuring the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.
MPs and Ministers will now digest the report, and decide what they
make of Nolan's prescription. Much of what he recommends, like his Seven
Principles of Public Life, amounts to no more than pointing out the
obvious. Politicians should be open about their decisions, honest in
their dealings, and objective in making appointments. But if it's so
obvious to the public, why do MPs need to be told?
This is one of the Nolan Committee's unavoidable weaknesses. However
clear the rules, there will always be a small number of politicians who
are prepared to stretch them or even ignore them altogether. As one
Labour MP muttered yesterday: ''If you need guidelines to decide if it's
wrong to accept #1000 to ask a question, then you've got serious
problems''.
On paper, the principle that one Parliament cannot bind another means
that the Nolan Committee's shelf-life need stretch no further than the
next election. But political reality says otherwise. The perception that
something is wrong with the British body politic is so strong that it
would be brave Government that ignored what Nolan suggests. Professor
Neil MacCormick of Edinburgh University observed yesterday: ''In the
present state of apparent fact and certain opinion it was essential to
get an outsider to take an impartial look at the standards of public
life''.
The outsider chosen is, unlike other committees set up by Governments
in trouble, a standing committee. Lord Nolan and his nine friends will
not go away. They will continue their work and, despite clear
suggestions from the Prime Minister that some areas are out of bounds,
they show every intention of interpreting their brief as widely as
possible.
One possibility for their next inquiry is an examination of the
funding of political parties, a subject that the Conservative Party in
particular is keen to avoid. Labour has made much of Tory Central
Office's refusal to disclose sources of the contributions it receives.
Secrecy breeds suspicion, and no-one has yet disproved the connection
between the size of corporate donations and the awarding of knighthoods
and other honours to otherwise obscure industrialists. For Labour such
an investigation would expose its dependence on the trades unions.
But for the moment MPs and Ministers are considering the implications
of this report, and what it says about Parliament's ability and
willingness to regulate itself. For a sovereign Parliament to have to
admit that it is incapable of telling right from wrong is an admission
that speaks volumes about the transformation that has hit British
political culture since the Tories took power in 1979.
Both the mechanisms of Government and our attitudes towards our public
servants have been transformed. Chunks of the Civil Service have been
hived-off into agencies run by unelected political appointees. In
seeking to introduce efficiency into Government and its finances,
accountability has been lost. And among civil servants' concern over the
Civil Service's politicisation, a near-inevitable result of 16 years
without a change of government, is growing.
Opposition parties have focused on the Government's fondness for
unelected quangos, and the perception that their members are chosen on a
jobs-for-the-boys basis, with school tie mattering more than
qualifications. Under the Tories, quango funding has doubled in real
terms, from #3bn in 1979 to #15bn last year.
They range in size and activity from the Legal Aid Board, with a
budget of #1.28 billion a year, to the UK Polar Medal Assessment
Committee which survives on a mere #1000. The four highest paid quango
chairmen -- all men -- earn more than #95,000 a year, including Lord
Davidson of the Scottish Law Commission and Lord Wyatt of the Tote. In a
far reaching recommendation Lord Nolan wants future appointments to be
handled by a new Public Appointments Commissioner.
The public's expectations, meanwhile, have been heightened by the Tory
emphasis on value for money, transparency in public expenditure, and
consumer rights. We expect to know much more about how Government
operates and those at the top run their lives. It is not just MPs:
company directors are expected to reveal their salaries, an intrusion
that would have seemed intolerable as recently as 20 years ago.
With their emphasis on individualism Margaret Thatcher and John Major
have encouraged their supporters to put personal enrichment ahead of
public service. And, as Labour is at pains to point out, this is nowhere
more obvious than at the House of Commons in the debate over the outside
interests of MPs.
Those who support the right of MPs to do more than their Parliamentary
duty stress the importance of having politicians with experience of the
outside world. Labour actually agrees, but as its Home Affairs spokesman
Jack Straw has pointed out, it is the type of experience that counts.
In Labour's eyes, working as an unpaid school governor or on the board
of a charity is a far more useful outside interest than a #10,000 a year
consultancy for a Westminster public relations firm.
Professor MacCormick says the Government is, in fact, a victim of its
own reforms. ''If you set up a culture in which everything is done on a
market basis, you shouldn't be surprised when the political world enters
the market as well.''
Yesterday the Government said it would accept the broad thrust of
Nolan's recommendations. It has no choice. It has surrendered
Parliament's claim to self-regulation and handed it to outsiders.
Ultimately, though, a politician's integrity is a strictly personal
matter.

THE only isolation units in Scotland capable of dealing with deadly
tropical viruses have been withdrawn.
They were installed at Ruchill Hospital in Glasgow for patients with
dangerous infections like Lassa fever, Marburg virus (green monkey
disease), or the Ebola virus which has sent shock waves around the world
after an outbreak in Zaire.
Ruchill had two Texler units -- including clear plastic tents which
form an isolation bubble with a bed inside. They have two sleeve inserts
so that staff can care for patients without risk of infection.
Four years ago, however, the Government decided to focus the care of
all confirmed cases in a hospital in North London, where three places
are available. There is the possibility of a fourth place being made
available in Newcastle.
Now the plastic tents lie disused and in disrepair in a storeroom. If
anyone was found to have a virus of this class they would probably be
taken by air ambulance to London.
Dr Campbell Love, consultant in communicable diseases at Ruchill, said
yesterday: ''There has always been a contingency for cases of viral
haemorrhagic fever, of which Ebola is one type -- they require a rather
higher than usual standard of precautions in the handling of patients
and blood samples than we require in most cases of infectious disease.
''They have a bad record of spread to hospital personnel and a high
mortality rate but, because there have been so few cases imported into
Britain, it was decided by the Scottish Health Department that it was
not necessary to keep them here.''
The hospital has a holding unit for suspected cases but it is strictly
temporary. There is also a mobile Texler which can collect patients from
their homes and would be used to fly them to London if their infection
was confirmed.
However, Dr Love said: ''There would be considerable problems in
transporting patients. The portable Texlers have not been properly tried
out for long-distance travel.''
He was reluctant to become embroiled in controversy about the decision
but admitted: ''It is a sore point.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''The decision reflects the rarity
of this type of viral haemorrhagic fever in Britain. There has been none
for 10 years and it was decided it was better done on a UK basis.''
The last such case in Britain involved Lassa fever but it was confined
to the initial case. There was a scare in Glasgow two years ago, when
four-year-old Dawn Roulston, from Castlemilk, died from a mystery
illness. One of the family's two pet monkeys had died three weeks
previously and the second was put down for testing but nothing was
established to link the monkeys with the girl's death.
Although viruses like Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola are thought to have
jumped the species, Dr Love said there was no evidence of a reservoir of
infection in the monkey population.
It spreads through blood and body fluid and this has contributed to
the deaths of a number of health workers -- including two Italian nuns
-- fighting the current Zairean outbreak, which is now thought to have
spread from the town of Kikwit to a second town, Matengo. Both are
within about 500 kilometres of the capital, Kinshasa.
The government declared Kikwit a disaster zone and imposed a
quarantine order on its 500,000 people, and the governor of Kinshasa has
decreed exceptional measures to shield the capital and its five million
inhabitants from the virus, for which there is no cure or vaccine.
The epidemic has sparked comparisons with the Hollywood thriller
Outbreak, starring Dustin Hoffman, about a fight to defeat a virus
infecting hundreds of people in a small Californian town. The carrier is
a pet monkey from Zaire.

THREE prisoners who hanged themselves with bedsheets within weeks of
each other in the same prison should have been put on observation but
were not because of an error, a fatal accident inquiry was told
yesterday.
The inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court into the deaths of Barlinnie
prisoners John Grant, 50, of Grangemouth on May 27 last year, Alan
Scott, 24, of Falkirk on June 7, and William Halford, 43, of Motherwell,
who died on June 29, nine days after his suicide bid, also heard they
were not given medication prescribed by the prison medical officer.
Mrs Kate Donegan, the deputy governor of the Glasgow jail said that
following the deaths a massive internal probe was launched.
This disclosed that doctors had recommended the three be placed under
special observation and be given medication but the records ordering
this were not transferred to prison officers.
Mrs Donegan, 42, admitted to procurator fiscal depute Mrs Margaret
Porter, who is leading the evidence, that the system was ''not robust
enough'' to pick up such errors.
She also revealed that recording of prisoners who were to be observed
used to be done on an exercise-type book.
In the cases of the deaths there were no observation records and the
probe never revealed who was responsible.
As a result, radical changes have been made to produce a failsafe
system.
Sheriff Eric Galt, who is conducting the fatal accident inquiry, also
heard of a dramatic rise in cell suicides in Scottish jails last year,
when 16 prisoners died,prompting a full scale review of the Scottish
Prison Service's suicide strategy.
One of Britain's top forensic psychiatrists, Professor John Gunn, of
London University, is conducting the probe and is due to report his
findings on October 1.
The inquiry continues.

WHEN Hollywood actor Liam Neeson steps out in Edinburgh this weekend
to attend the UK premiere of his latest film Rob Roy, he will be wearing
a kilt that conceals a secret.
One adoring Scottish fan has revealed that hidden underneath is . . .
her telephone number.
Kiltmaker Isabel Jamieson couldn't believe her ears when she got a
phone call last month asking if she had time to make a kilt for the
film's star.
The voice on the other end of the phone asked the mother-of-two from
Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, if she had ever heard of the Irish actor Liam
Neeson.
''I just screamed down the phone, 'Give me his measurements,' before
collapsing,'' said Mrs Jamieson.''I just couldn't believe that I was
being asked if I had time to make a kilt for one of my all-time
heroes.''
Just eight hours later, her creation in the Ancient Forbes tartan was
finished and she was about to wrap it up and send it to the Borders
kiltmakers, Lochcarron, who had commissioned her to do the job, when she
decided to open part of the lining.
Mrs Jamieson said: ''I knew Lochcarron would want to put their label
on the top of the kilt and not use mine but I wanted to put a bit of me
somewhere.
''So I opened up the lining and sewed in my name and phone number.I
thought, you never know, he might spot it and give me a call one day.''
However, two weeks later, her hopes of the star ever calling her to
thank her for her kilt were dashed when he was reported as saying the
kilt had been made by New York designer Donna Karan.
''I couldn't believe it,'' said Mrs Jamieson, but added: ''You can't
be angry for long with a man that looks that good.
''And I might even travel through to Edinburgh to see him wearing it
in the flesh.''

A FORMER consultant surgeon in Shetland was accused of negligence by
one of Scotland's leading surgeons, during a fatal accident inquiry
yesterday.
Councillor Alex Arthur, 68, died after a gall bladder operation at
Gilbert Bain Hospital, in Lerwick, two years ago.
The inquiry at Lerwick was told that surgeon John Parkin had performed
keyhole and open surgery to remove a gallstone.
Two hours after the operation, junior staff believed that Mr Arthur
had haemorrhaged and Mr Parkin was telephoned at home.
But it was two hours later, at 9pm, when he turned up.
One hour later, Mr Parkin left because he thought the patient was
improving. However, very soon afterwards, nurses became worried when
they turned Mr Arthur and he lost more blood. They contacted Mr Parkin,
who returned and called in staff to carry out an emergency operation.
Mr Parkin tried several techniques to stop the bleeding, none of which
worked. After 90 minutes, he went for a cup of coffee with the senior
house officer, leaving the rest of the staff in the theatre. They
returned 10 minutes later and Mr Parkin said there was nothing more that
could be done.
Nursing officer Carol Burgess said staff were horrified.
She said: ''I considered we were in a dire emergency situation and it
was totally inappropriate for the surgeon to leave the theatre.''
Mr Douglas Harper, a surgeon at Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary,
who conducted an investigation into Mr Arthur's death, said Mr Parkin
should have attended the hospital at 7pm, when he was first contacted.
''The patient was clearly bleeding far more than was usual after such
an operation. He clearly had an internal haemorrhage,'' Mr Harper said.
''A competent surgeon would have attended immediately. Overall, he was
negligent and Mr Arthur's death was avoidable.''
Mr Harper also criticised Mr Parkin's initial operating technique.
The inquiry continues today.

RUMBLINGS of discontent came from secondary headteachers yesterday,
after they were told that the Government's deadline for implementing the
Higher Still reform of fifth and sixth-year schooling was tight but
manageable.
Mr Nisbet Gallacher, the senior chief inspector of schools, told
delegates attending a Headteachers' Association of Scotland conference
near Perth: ''We have two years in which to get our act together.
''If this was a group of businessmen, they would think that was a
generous timescale to be operating to,'' a remark which did not go down
well with the audience.
Mr Gallacher had heard Mr George Haggerty, head of St John's High in
Dundee, explain why the timescale greatly concerned him.
Mr Haggerty said there were only 15 months of school time, four days
for in-service work, and some extra hours before the first group of
senior pupils would be given Higher Still study options.
''All I face is a bunch of dry bones . . . I do not see flesh on it. I
am trying to explain a programme which I do not fully understand,'' said
the head.
Mr Gallacher said the Higher Still developments were going to plan and
he hoped that the framework would be finalised by early 1996. ''I think
that is early enough for schools to gear themselves up for 1997/8,'' he
said.

AN English cider maker is targeting Scottish teenagers with a new
alcoholic lemonade. It has the same alcohol strength as beer but tastes
like a soft drink.
Two Dogs lemonade has become a cult drink among young people in
Australia and is being imported by the Sussex cider firm, Merrydown. The
drink will go on sale in Scottish clubs, pubs, and hotels next month.
Two Dogs is made from fermented lemons and has an alcohol-by-volume
strength of 4% -- stronger than Tartan Special.
Ms Deborah Merrens, brand manager at Merrydown, said: ''Two Dogs is a
completely new category. It is a great summer drink which will go down
well in young people's venues and style bars.
''It is much more of a cult brand which will appeal to opinion
leaders.''
She added: ''We will be marketing Two Dogs in 275ml bottles which have
a cute printed label of two dogs on them. It will be priced in the same
category as other premium packaged products such as lager and cider.
''It is likely that Merrydown will begin producing Two Dogs under
licence in Sussex next year.''

THE Church of Scotland's board of communication turned a deficit into
a surplus in its operations last year, the General Assembly will be told
when it meets in Edinburgh later this month.
Its financial position showed a very encouraging picture, with a net
surplus of #107,781 at December 31, compared with a deficit of #97,347 a
year earlier.
The board's report to the Assembly, published today, says that staff
redundancies implemented in 1993 were a major factor contributing to the
cost reductions achieved in 1994.
Life and Work, the Kirk's magazine, continued to operate at a profit,
although its circulation declined from 77,257 in 1993 to 70,807 in 1994.

JOHN Major was forced to set up the Nolan inquiry in an attempt to
counter the flood of ''sleaze'' claims that, at the time, threatened to
swamp his Government, writes DUNCAN BLACK
THE ugly flood of ''sleaze'' allegations at one stage threatened to
destroy the Tories like seabirds caught in an oilslick.
Ministers and MPs were struggling as wave after wave of claims of
financial impropriety washed over them. Such scandals are difficult to
wash away, regardless of where the truth lies: that kind of dirt tends
to cling.
It was faced with this crisis that the Prime Minister decided in
October last year to set up the Nolan inquiry into standards in public
life.
He was determined to counter the claims and to try to reassure the
electorate that it could put its trust in the integrity of Parliament.
When Mr Major announced the inquiry, the Tories had already endured
several months during which the sleaze factor had refused to loosen its
sticky grip on the political agenda.
The allegation which proved the most instrumental in causing the
inquiry to be set up was perhaps the ''cash for questions'' affair.
In July, the Sunday Times claimed that two Tory MPs, David Tredinnick
(Bosworth) and Graham Riddick (Colne Valley) had been prepared to accept
#1000 each to table questions in the Commons when approached by
undercover reporters posing as businessmen.
Both were subsequently forced to resign their positions as unpaid
Parliamentary Private Secretaries. Last month, after an investigation by
the Commons Privileges Committee, Mr Tredinnick was suspended from the
Commons for 20 days and Mr Riddick for 10 days.
Caught up in a separate ''cash for questions'' scandal were Junior
Northern Ireland Minister Tim Smith and Corporate Affairs Minister Neil
Hamilton, who were accused of accepting money to ask questions in the
House on behalf of Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed. Both Ministers
resigned in October, although Mr Hamilton did so still declaring his
innocence.
About the same time as the storm over Messrs Tredinnick and Riddick
broke out, a different kind of allegation was being levelled against
Lord Archer, the millionaire author and former deputy chairman of the
Tory Party.
It was revealed that Department of Trade and Industry inspectors were
investigating dealings in shares in Anglia Television, of which his wife
was a non-executive director. Lord Archer denied any suggestion of
irregularity.
After the inspectors submitted their report, the President of the
Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, said no action would be taken.
Despite Opposition pressure, he refused to publish the report.
The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Aitken, has also been
hit by sleaze allegations. In October, it was claimed that his hotel
bill at the Ritz Hotel in Paris had been paid for by a Saudi Arabian
businessman. Mr Aitken denied this.
Also in October, leading Tory Dame Angela Rumbold resigned as a
director of lobbying firm Decision Makers after questions about the
company's role in the Government's choice of a Channel Tunnel rail link
station at Ebbsfleet in Kent.
To add to the Tories' woes that month, there were fresh allegations
that Mr Mark Thatcher, son of former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher,
had made millions of pounds in commission by acting as a go-between in
an arms deal negotiated by his mother with Saudi Arabia in the
mid-1980s.
Even after the Nolan inquiry began, the sleaze scandals continued. In
February, senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester claimed that four
peers had been paid for putting questions to Ministers.
In March, Mr Aitken was again under scrutiny, this time over alleged
links to a sanctions-busting arms deal with Iran while he was a
non-executive director of the BMARC company. He denied all knowledge of
the deal and has since issued writs against the Guardian newspaper and
Granada Television over the claims.
Last month, Lady Thatcher's son was back in the headlines when Labour
demanded an inquiry into new claims that her office as Prime Minister
had been used to further his business career.
Apart from the outside interests of MPs and peers, another area of
concern examined by the Nolan Committee was the question of employment
accepted by Ministers on leaving office. The Opposition has frequently
cried ''jobs for the boys'' over highly-paid posts enjoyed by former
Ministers.
One of the most recent controversies was the appointment of Lord
Wakeham to a part-time #50,000-a-year job with merchant bankers N M
Rothschild which was involved as underwriters or advisers to the
Government in several privatisations, including British Telecom and
British Coal.
Lord Wakeham quit as Energy Secretary five years ago after the
completion of electricity privatisation and resigned from the Government
last year as Leader of the House of Lords.
When the Rothschild appointment was announced in January, Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown urged Lord Nolan to rule on the flow of
ex-Ministers into jobs with companies they had helped to privatise.
Mr Brown said: ''The Cabinet Room is becoming a recruiting ground for
the boards of privatised companies: now Lord Wakeham's number has come
up in the National Lottery of jobs for the boys.''
Many other former Ministers have joined top firms in the City and
industry in recent years.
Former Chancellor Norman Lamont is already on the board at Rothschild,
joining just a few months after he was sacked from the Government.
Lord Tebbit, former Trade and Industry Secretary, who headed the
privatisation of British Telecom, joined the BT board after leaving the
Government.
Lord Walker, who arranged gas privatisation as Energy Secretary, is
now on the board of British Gas. Former Trade Secretary Lord Young, who
regulated Cable and Wireless, is now the chairman of the company.
Sir Norman Fowler, who privatised National Freight as Transport
Secretary, now sits on its board. Former Transport Secretary John
MacGregor moved to merchant bankers Hill Samuel after resigning from the
Government last year.
Some ex-Ministers can boast a large number of paid posts outside
Parliament. Former Heritage Secretary David Mellor has at least 11 paid
consultancies, including four with defence manufacturers with commercial
links with the Government.
Government appointments to quangos have also caused the Opposition to
complain of ''jobs for the boys'' with increasing regularity. The most
recent instances include the re-appointment in February of Lord Wyatt as
the #95,000-a-year chairman of the Horserace Totalisator Board.

<HEADLINE>Howard concedes more cash to victims of crime</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978436391</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
HOME Secretary Michael Howard yesterday made a partial climb-down over
his proposal for a tariff-based scheme to pay compensation to victims of
crime.
The scheme, introduced in April 1994, which would have cut the amount
of compensation expected to be paid to victims of crime in the year 2000
from #460m under the common law scheme, to #200m, was thrown out after
it was ruled unlawful by law lords earlier this year.
Yesterday, Mr Howard announced a revised tariff-based scheme which
would cost around #260m in compensation in the year 2000 and, if it gets
through Parliament as expected this session, would be in operation by
April 1996.
Under the new criminal injuries compensation scheme, victims of crime
would receive payments ranging from #1000 to #250,000, as in the
previous scheme. In a concession following the widespread criticism, Mr
Howard said the payments would also allow for loss of earnings and the
cost of nursing care in the most serious cases.
These would be where the victims of crime were incapacitated for more
than 28 weeks.
Rape victims, who would be entitled to #17,500 compensation, would
also be entitled to more money, where there was additional serious
injury.
People receiving higher awards, for example #250,000 for permanent
brain damage or paralysis of four limbs, would be allowed a structure
settlement in which they would be guaranteed an index-linked, tax-free
income for life. Awards will be capped at #500,000.
Launching the new Criminal Injuries Compensation Bill, Mr Howard said:
''What we have to do is balance the important need to look after the
interest of the victim, with the legitimate interest of the taxpayers.
''We have looked at the particular concerns and criticisms voiced at
our first shot at the tariff-based system, and have tried to meet the
most important ones in this scheme.''
He said the scheme was ''on a scale of generosity unmatched anywhere
else in the world''.
Mr Howard said the new tariff-based scheme would allow payments to be
made ''quickly and predictably, at an overall cost which the country can
afford''.
The main saving will be that people will not be entitled to claim for
loss of earnings or health-care costs if they are off work for less than
28 weeks.
However, despite the savings, some people would still be better off
under the new scheme. The tariff for each injury had been based on the
median level of awards made for such injuries under the old scheme, he
said.
Speaking of the simplicity of the scheme, he said: ''The common law
based scheme was inevitably somewhat complicated and took longer before
the payments got to the victms of crime, because setting damages
according to common law criteria is quite a complicated task.''
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw welcomed some of the changes but,
claiming they did not go far enough, said: ''These concessions are
nothing like enough to deal with the fundamental failures of the tariff
scheme. They only show that Michael Howard and the Government are on the
run on the issue.''
Liberal Democrat MP Alan Beith said: ''The Home Secretary is still
denying a fair deal to the victims of crime. He has been forced by the
courts to put a new scheme before Parliament. But he is planning to
spend #85m less on helping those who have suffered criminal injuries.''
The chairman of the Law Society's courts and legal services committee,
Mr Robert Winstanley, said the new scheme should be fairer, and added:
''It is very heartening that the scheme the Government is now working on
appears to have many features of the alternative proposals put forward
by the Law Society last year.''
Mr Alex Wise of Victim Support, the national charity for victims of
crime, said: ''We are delighted that victims of serious crime will now
be able to claim loss of earnings, and that this scheme will be more
generous than the previous tariff scheme.''

THE worst fears of the public are confirmed by the first report of the
Nolan Committee into standards in public life, writes JAMES McKILLOP
''SLEAZE'' in politics is not merely a figment in the imagination of
the sensationalist press anxious to boost circulation by chasing yet
further headlines involving scandal in high places. ''Neither we nor the
media have invented these problems,'' the Nolan committee reports.
''Sleaze'' exists and has to be dealt with by firm and immediate
action, Lord Nolan and his ten-person committee confirm.
The report makes it clear that MPs in recent years might have felt
themselves free to defy the rules governing reports of interests that
are required by the House of Commons to be declared. All that will have
to change.
The time had come to restate Seven Principles of Public Life --
selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty,
and leadership.
MPs and Ministers are not spared in this first report by the Nolan
committee.
The members have come up with 55 detailed recommendations for action
that will radically change attitudes in the House of Commons. They will
certainly mean that backbench MPs will have to think twice -- and if
necessary gain approval -- before taking up consultancies.
Ministers will also have to conform to new rules that would mean they
could not take up jobs in industry until they had been out of office for
up to two years.
This is just the initial report of the Nolan Committee, which
continues to sit. However, already the members have come to grips with
the general disquiet following ''sleaze'' stories in newspapers.
It all came to a head amidst allegations that Conservative MPs were
pepared to ask questions in the House of Commons in return for cash
payments.
The report makes it clear that while Parliament did eventually impose
its own penalties on the MPs involved, it suggests that the action
should have been taken much sooner.
''It would be comforting to think that the public believe that
standards have declined only because of the growth in media activity and
intrusion into the private lives of public figures,'' the report
observes. ''Yet we do not believe that this is the whole answer.''
The committee reports that the erosion of public confidence in holders
of public office was a serious matter.
It was time to restore clarity and direction wherever moral
uncertainty had crept into the system of Government.
''A degree of austerity, of respect for the traditions of upright
behaviour in British public life, is not only desirable, but
essential,'' the report declares.
Recommendations and procedures outlined in the report were intended to
deter wrong-doing but at the same time sought to restore respect for the
ethical values inherent in the idea of public service.
''Formal procedures have a role to play, but in the end it is
individuals' consciences that matter,'' the report says.
''First of all, we in Britain have, with reason, always prided
ourselves on the standards of conduct of the vast majority of our public
servants and that must be restored.
''Secondly, experience elsewhere warns that unless the strictest
standards are maintained and where necessary restored, corruption and
malpractice can become part of the way of life.
''The threat at the moment is not great. However, action needs to be
taken before it becomes so.''
Key recommendations call for:
* The establishment of an independent Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards to oversee tough new rules on MPs interests;
* The requirement for former Ministers to seek clearance for jobs they
take up in commerce and industry within two years of leaving office;
* A new Public Appointments Commissioner to ensure the highest
standards of properiety in appointments to quangos.
Presenting the report to Mr Major, Lord Nolan, chairman of the
committee, said that witnesses and letters from the public had made it
plain that anxiety about conduct in public life was widely shared and
deeply felt. ''But we found that it was matched on all sides by a
resolute determination to see that things are put right.''
He continued: ''We have no doubt that this can be done if firm action
is put in hand now.''
There was, he said, no shortage of men and women with the qualities
and integrity and altruism upon which the tradition of public service
was based.
''But changes which have occurred over the years in the roles and
working environment of politicians and other public servants have led to
confusion over what is and what is not acceptable behaviour.''
This had been accompanied by a number of incidents indicating ''a
certain slackness'' in the observance and enforcement of high standards
by those concerned.
In turn, this had helped generate a widespread suspicion that much
more misconduct occured than was revealed to the public gaze.
''Unless corrective measures are promptly taken, there is a danger
that anxiety and suspicion will give way to disillusion and growing
cynicism,'' Lord Nolan states.
''Our recommendations are designed to maintain, and where necessary
restore the standards of conduct in public life which the public are
entitled to expect.''
The report highlights the fact that the fall in public confidence in
the financial probity of MPs has coincided with an increase in their
number holding paid consultancies relating to their Parliamentary role.
Some 30% of backbenchers now held such consultancies.
When all outside interests were taken into account, the report
highlights an equation which would be much higher.
While the committee has concluded that the House of Commons would
become less effective if all MPs were full-time professional
politicians, it condemns those who sell their services to firms engaged
in lobbying.
The report is unequivocal: such activites should be banned.
''The House should act immediately to stop this practice by outlawing
agreements which commit Members to giving Parliamentary advice for
payment to multi-client lobbying organisations or to the clients of such
organisations.''
A total ban on all consultancy agreements and forms of advocacy would
be impracticable, the report concludes.
''It would involve asking three-fifths of the Members of the House and
their clients or sponsors to ammend with immediate effect arrangments
which have been made perfectly lawfully and are often very long
standing.
''Because so many Members have such interests, and so would be
excluded from particular pieces of business, there would be a short term
disruption of the business of the House.''
Nevertheless, full disclosure of consultancy agreements and payments,
and of trade union sponsorship agreements and payments, should be
introduced immediately, the report concludes. In addition the Register
of Interests of Members should be vastly more informative than it is at
present. A Code of Conduct for MPs should also be drawn up .
''The public needs to know that the rules of conduct governing MPs'
financial interests are being firmly and fairly enforced,'' the report
declares. ''There have been calls for these rules to be put into statute
law and enforced by the courts.''
However, the committee concluded that the House of Commons should
continue to be responsible for enforcing its own rules rather than High
Court judges. Nevertheless better arrangements were required.
''The House should appoint as Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards, a person of independent standing who will take over
responsibility for maintaining the Register of Members interests; for
advice and guidance to MPs on matter of conduct; for advising on the
Code of Conduct; and for investigating allegations of misconduct,'' the
report recommends.
The Commissioners conclusions would, as a matter of course, be made
public.
Lord Nolan attempted to put it all in context. ''Parliament is the
cornerstone of our democracy,'' he said. ''If standards of conduct in
Parliament command public confidence, nothing can go wrong.
''If they don't, nothing much can go right and the whole edifice could
crumble.''

<HEADLINE>Nurses' pay policy in tatters. Government's attempt to pacify unions backfires</HEADLINE>

THE Government's policy on nurses' pay was left in tatters last night
as unions reported that only around half of the 46 Scottish NHS trusts
were meeting the deadline for deals.
The instruction to make formal offers to nurses, midwives, and
paramedical staff within 48 hours was given on Tuesday by NHS chief
executive Mr Geoff Scaife.
As an attempt to assuage nurses' anger, it appears to have backfired
badly, particularly as both Mr Scaife and his personnel director, Mr
Mike Sibbald, were away from their offices in Edinburgh as the trusts
faxed in details of their proposals.
Unison said not one offer met its demands and the Royal College of
Midwives said the position was ''unbelievable chaos''. The Royal College
of Nursing, while welcoming some offers, said the overall response from
trusts had been insulting.
Ms June Andrews, Scottish secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
said: ''The Government is prepared to upset a large number of people for
the sake of what is a relatively small sum. The costs of negotiating
this locally will be more than what they will actually save.
''This is why we and the other unions would rather not bother with it
because it is a complete waste of time.''
By last night, the RCN had received 25 offers, of which 15 were around
3%, but some had strings. It is due to vote on industrial action next
week at its congress in Harrogate.
Ms Andrews said: ''I am extremely annoyed at the idea that just
receiving offers would be acceptable to the RCN. Anything less than 3%
without strings is an insult to our members and the more insults we get
this week the angrier the RCN is going to be next week.''
Mrs Patricia Purton, Scottish director of the RCM, said: ''We are most
certainly not happy with the offers that have come in.
''Some of the conditions to them are really quite ridiculous. It
appears that some trusts are totally ignorant of any trade-union
legislation and are completely lacking in the ability even to
communicate properly.''
Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer for Unison, said: ''The offers
made to us indicate chaos throughout Scotland. In the main, they are
giving a pound in one hand and taking two out of the other.
''Our claim of 3%, fully funded without strings, and the retention of
national pay bargaining has not been met by one single Scottish trust.''
Yorkhill in Glasgow is one hospital to offer 3%. One nurse, who asked
not to be named, said: ''The conditions attached to it are outrageous.
We are being asked to sacrifice public holidays, extra duty, and other
payments.
''We have been sold down the river for months and all nurses, whether
in the RCN or Unison, have just had enough. The only perk we have to
leave our families at Christmas or Easter is an extra #10 and now they
want to take that off us.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said Mr Scaife and Mr Sibbald were away on
NHS business but their absence disproved notions of a heavy-handed
central direction to trusts.
''We have asked the trusts to negotiate locally. That is exactly what
they are doing and we are awaiting their responses,'' he added.

<HEADLINE>Sheriff promises stiff sentences for temazepam supply</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978436395</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DRUGS dealers handing out temazepam to young people were warned at
Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, to brace themselves for a stiff
sentence if caught.
Sheriff James Spy's stern caution came just a day after strict new
measures to clamp down on misuse of the drug were announced by the
Government.
He issued the warning when sentencing Stuart Murray, 29, to a total of
18 months' imprisonment, after he was found guilty of breaking into
houses at Henderson Street and Brown Street, both Paisley, in May last
year, and stealing a video recorder and prescribed drugs, and being
found in possession of cannabis resin, temazepam, nitrazepam, and
diazepam tablets.
The sheriff said that, due to growing fears in the Paisley area over
misuse of Class C prescribed drugs such as temazepam, he had no
alternative but to impose a custodial sentence.
Sentencing Murray, c/o Millford Street, Cranhill, Glasgow, to twelve
months on the drugs charges, and six months for the housebreaking
offences, Sheriff Spy said: ''There are considerable concerns being
expressed in this area at the moment over drugs such as temazepam. I
would be failing in my duty if the sentence imposed did not reflect
those concerns.''
The court was told Murray, formerly from Bridge of Weir, had been
disowned by his family and rejected by his girlfriend following his
arrest on the charges last year.

A NIGHTCLUB bouncer was found not guilty yesterday of murdering a
young mother as her baby daughter slept in the room next door.
A jury at the High Court in Airdrie found Mr Robert Brown, 26, not
guilty of murdering Ms Pamela McAllister, 21, who had been stabbed and
slashed 57 times.
Mr Brown was also found not guilty of attempting to murder Ms
McAllister's boyfriend, Mr Ian Gray, 32, by stabbing him repeatedly on
the body and head.
Ms McAllister was murdered at the home she shared with Mr Gray in
Beauly Place, East Kilbride.
There were gasps in court when the jury foreman announced both
verdicts which he said were majority decisions.
Two of Ms McAllister's relatives burst into tears and shouted: ''Oh,
no!''
Outside the court, a furious Mr Gray pointed to scars on his face and
neck.
Ms McAllister's cousin, Mrs Danna Clerk, 40, of East Kilbride, wept as
she said: ''That girl was butchered. There is no justice.
''A jury . . . it's just a laugh.''
The court had heard evidence from Mr Gray that Mr Brown, nicknamed
Robo, had called at the flat on November 14 last year.
Mr Gray, who admitted he had spent six years in jail for drugs
offences, had claimed that Mr Brown said the flat's owner owed him
money.
He told the court an arguement had broken out and Mr Brown pulled a
knife in the living room.
Ms McAllister tried to stop the fight and Mr Gray alleged Mr Brown
threw her on to a coffee table, which collapsed.
He said: ''The next I saw, Brown was astride her on the floor
slashing. Pamela was shouting, 'Robo, my baby'.''
He also gave evidence that Mr Brown stabbed and slashed him
repeatedly.
Mr Gray was found collapsed with knife wounds outside the flat.
However, Mr Brown, of Trinidad Way, East Kilbride, lodged a special
defence naming Mr Gray as the killer.
He said he had no idea why he had been accused.
He added that Mr Gray, armed with two knives, had attacked him and
that Mr Gray had stabbed Ms McAllister repeatedly during the fight.
Mr Brown said he fled from the flat believing he was being pursued by
Mr Gray.
He denied he himself had a knife in his hands at any time.
He was uninjured apart from a slash wound on his left hand which he
said came as he grabbed a knife blade wielded by Mr Gray.
At first, Mr Gray told police officers that two hooded men had forced
their way into the flat. He said he later changed his story when he
found out Ms McAllister was dead.
Last night, East Kilbride Police Superintendent Willie Short was asked
if there would be further inquiries made into the murder.
He said: ''We can make no comment at the moment except to say we are
awaiting instruction from the Crown Office.''
Ms McAllister's baby, Monika, was just five monthsold and sleeping
peacefully in her cot in the next door bedroom when her mother was
murdered.
She is now being brought up by her grandmother, Mrs Jola Majak, 51, at
her home in East Kilbride.
Because Monika looks so like her mother, it has helped Polish-born Mrs
Majak through the pain of losing her only child.
However, Ms McAllister's relations still do not know who her killer is
after yesterday's verdict.
All they know is that Ms McAllister died from knife wounds. Her
injuries were so horrific that the trial judge, Lord Clyde, ruled that
the jury should not see the photographs of her body.
Ms McAllister's cousin, Mrs Beata Sim, 26, of Rutherglen, was in tears
as she left the court after hearing the verdicts.
She said yesterday: ''What happens now? Who did kill Pamela? Who will
be charged? What will we one day tell Monika?
''Monika is now 11 months old and getting all the care and love she
can get from her gran. She is the image of her mother and this has
helped Jola through this terrible ordeal.
''Monika is very happy and of course is far too young to know what
happened. But she will have to be told one day.''

BRITAIN is set to lose one of its two major train-building factories.
With it will go 750 jobs directly and around 8000 dependent jobs.
The news came amid claims that privatisation had sealed the plant's
fate.
York-based Swedish-Swiss ABB Transportation is to be shut down by the
end of the year, with a phased redundancy programme beginning in July.
The joint firm will lose #50m in private investment.
The survival of the plant depended on an immediate order for rolling
stock for up to 40 routes on the Kent commuter lines. However, a
Government decision on funding for that is at least two years away.
A mass meeting of workers was told at lunchtime yesterday.
Labour transport spokesman Michael Meacher said the closure was the
direct result of rail privatisation. He also claimed that ABB would have
been ''healthy and growing'' if the Government had not delayed ordering
replacement trains.
''Every worker who gets a P45 can lay it straight at the door of Prime
Minister John Major and Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney,'' he added.
Mr Major yesterday denied that Government policy was to blame for the
shutdown. He told the Commons that privatisation was ''no more
responsible for the closure than it is for an outbreak of measles.''
The company had already lost out on a #700m order for new trains for
the London underground system to its Birmingham-based rival GEC-Alsthom.

HEALTH Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie yesterday announced that #24m
would be made available to health boards to tackle drug misuse and
HIV/AIDS.
Around #10m will be committed to the drug problem.
Lord Fraser said the cash allocation demonstrated the Government's
resolve to tackle the issue.
He said the dangers of taking recreational drugs, such as ecstasy, had
been highlighted by the deaths at raves in Ayrshire.
He added that attempts were being made to draw up conditions to be
insisted on by local authorities licensing such dance events.
Practical moves to be taken to improve conditions at raves included
''chill-out areas'', good levels of stewarding, and free water for the
dancers.
Lord Fraser added: ''I cannot emphasise too strongly that the only
safe course is to say No to drugs of any kind.
''At the same time, action is necessary to alert organisers of raves
and young people who attend such events to the danger of drug taking and
how the risks can be reduced.''
He said new drugs-prevention packs for schoolchildren under 10 had
been prepared and would be launched later in the summer.
He also welcomed the publication of the White Paper setting out an
anti-drug misuse strategy for England.

SCOTRAIL and the British Railways Board face the possibility of a new
legal challenge -- this time in the English courts -- following the
Court of Session reprieve for the Fort William to London sleeper
service.
Council leaders in Cumbria are seeking legal advice in a bid to
prevent the phasing out of sleeper services stopping at Carlisle. A
judicial review is one of the options being considered.
Meanwhile, council officials in both Dumfries and Galloway and Cumbria
have organised a meeting with the director of ScotRail, Mr John Ellis,
on Monday in a bid to resolve the dispute.
Their concerns centre on planned changes to the Carlisle service. At
present, two carriages are parked in Carlisle Station from late evening,
allowing passengers to board and get a night's sleep before the main
train arrives from Scotland and joins up.
There is a similar arrangement for trains running in the opposite
direction. The facility was introduced to prevent passengers waiting for
arrival in the middle of the night.
ScotRail decided to withdraw the extra carriages at the end of this
month as part of plans to axe the sleeper service, claiming funds had
been cut by the Rail Franchising Office.
This week's interim interdict in the Court of Session in Edinburgh
delayed the withdrawal pending detailed public consultation.
However, fears remain that a less convenient Carlisle service would
disrupt tourism and business. Carlisle serves as the main rail facility
for more than 100,000 people in the Scottish borders as well as those in
the English catchment area.
Mr Roger Guy, Dumfries and Galloway director of roads and
transportation, warned that changes to the Carlisle service could affect
investment in the region.
He said: ''The first thing inward investors ask us is, 'How good are
communications and how conveniently can I get there?'. We don't have an
airport and we have always relied on Carlisle for trains so the sleeper
service is very important. This would certainly make people think twice
about whether they were going to invest further.''
However, he hoped Mr Ellis would offer protection for the Carlisle
service and allow a full consultation process to run its course.
Councillor Bill Cameron, chairman of Cumbria County Council and the
pressure group West Coast Rail 250, said: ''After the success of the
Scottish campaigners, we are looking to see if the same procedures can
apply to us -- it is currently in the hands of our legal advisers.''
ScotRail and the British Railways Board declined to comment on the
possibility of legal action.
However, a ScotRail spokesman said, although less convenient, it was
possible for passengers travelling to Carlisle to take the sleeper
service to Glasgow -- allowing a night's sleep -- before catching a
train south.
Mr Guy dismissed the idea of travelling to Glasgow before taking a
second train to Dumfries and Galloway as too inconvenient.

THE National Trust for Scotland has had to restrict the number of
visitors allowed into Charles Rennie Mackintosh's famous Hill House in
Helensburgh.
The trust has decided that that only eight to 10 people can tour the
upstairs bedrooms and bathroom at any one time following the appearance
of cracks in the plasterwork.
Major remedial work is planned for later this year after a structural
survey in March revealed that superficial cracking in the plaster
finishes of some walls and ceilings is probably the result of floor
joists flexing under the weight of visitors.
The Hill House, which was built in 1902-3 as a home for the Blackie
publishing family, was acquired by the NTS from the Royal Incorporation
of Architects in 1981 with financial support from the National Heritage
Memorial Fund. It was visited by about 7000 people during its first
season in 1982.
Since then, however, interest in Charles Rennie Mackintosh's work has
grown considerably and visitor numbers peaked at 40,000 during Glasgow's
spell as European City of Culture in 1990.
Last year, the number of visitors rose by 3% on the previous year to
35,440 during the nine-month open season and more than 40,000 visitors
are expected next year due to the major exhibition of Mackintosh's work
and other events in Glasgow.
A total of 40,000 visitors during the Hill House's open season means
an average of 150 people per afternoon but on a very busy day more than
400 people visit.
Mr Philip Schreiber, buildings surveyor in the NTS's west region, said
yesterday: ''We have a situation where plasterboards with Mackintosh's
original decoration on them are being damaged and we want to do what we
can to preserve those walls.
''We propose taking action to stiffen the floors where possible which
will let us continue to have a reasonable number of people in to see the
place.''
Mr Schreiber continued: ''The problem is Mackintosh designed the Hill
House as a dwelling house and not for the National Trust for Scotland to
open it to the public. Other properties, such as castles, can take large
numbers of people but the Hill House is a villa built for a Glasgow
businessman and can't cope with such large numbers.''
The remedial work is likely to be carried out during the Hill House's
closed season between next January and Easter.
Although the work has not yet been costed, the NTS has said that there
is a programme of annual repairs for all its properties, in conjunction
with Historic Scotland, and, as one of its major historic buildings, the
Hill House would receive priority funding.

THE eight-year-old boy who went missing from his home for three days
has been returned to his mother in Glasgow.
Thomas Rogers was back with Mrs Donna Murphy, 28, yesterday,
apparently unharmed by his ordeal.
According to Strathclyde Police, the child had been left with a friend
of Mrs Murphy on Wednesday evening.
Mrs Murphy, who also has a four-year-old daughter, Gemma, said she was
simply relieved to have her son back safely at her home in Ardnahoe
Avenue in the Toryglen area of the city.
She said she had been extremely worried about her son as she had had
no idea where he had been taken.
She added that he had been well looked after and had told her he had
been staying at various different addresses across the city.
''He's happy to be home with me. He's a wee bit shaky but he's been
spoilt rotten,'' she said.

POLICE have questioned a group of children aged between 10 and 12 over
alleged drug-taking at a primary school in Dumbarton.
The 10 youngsters were questioned by police at the school on
Wednesday.
A 12-year-old boy is now the subject of a report to the children's
panel. He has been suspended from school.
The other children involved have not been suspended but will all meet
an education official next week to discuss what happened.
The primary seven pupil is said to have brought prescription tablets
used for treating angina into school. The children who took the orange
tablets, which can cause dizziness, did not suffer ill effects.
One of the boys told his mum what had happened and she complained to
the school.
The school headmistress was not available for comment last night but a
Strathclyde education department spokeswoman confirmed that police were
investigating an alleged drugs-related incident at the school.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said: ''We can confirm that officers
were called in by staff on Wednesday.
''It followed an incident in which a pupil had allegedly provided
prescription tablets to other pupils of the school.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair clashed furiously with the Prime Minister in
the Commons yesterday after the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr
Eddie George, warned that the Government was likely to miss its key
inflation ceiling of 2.5% by the end of this Parliament.
The bank's prediction of a ''large'' risk that inflation was set to
increase -- on the day that new figures actually showed a drop -- also
stoked the row over interest rates.
The Governor said they would need to rise but the Chancellor, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, then made the surprise decision not to raise rates, a
move he defended robustly yesterday, insisting: ''I do endeavour to be
my own man -- I do take my own decisions.''
Brushing aside any notion of a dust-up with Mr George, he declared
that they were ''entirely agreed upon the object of policy and we
believe that policy has been delivered successfully''.
However, Mr Blair insisted there was ''a public rift'' between the
Government and the bank and said the fact an interest rate increase was
even being contemplated, when millions of people had barely moved out of
recession, showed the fundamental weakness of the economy.
Mr Major retorted that the Opposition criticised when rates went up
and when they did not. They were simply out to make short-term political
capital.
City analysts have criticised the Chancellor's decision, saying it was
taken for political reasons in the wake of the Government's drubbing in
the local elections and marked the start of a relaxation of the
Government's anti-inflation policies.
In a speech in Sheffield last night, Mr Clarke, insisted his decision
had been based purely on economic considerations.
''Although it was finely balanced, I decided against a further
increase in interest rates this month, especially as the full effects of
the three interest rate rises so far and the tax measures have not yet
been fully felt,'' he said.

THE stars of a follow-up to A Fish Called Wanda are planning to work
for next to nothing in return for a share of the profits.
If it is as successful as the first film, it will mean a cash bonanza
for John Cleese, Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Kevin Kline.
Shooting starts on the new film, Fierce Creatures, at Pinewood
Studios, Buckinghamshire, next week and, since it is set in a zoo, a
technical crew of more than 100 have constructed a zoo to house a
menagerie of weird and wonderful animals.
John Cleese, who co-wrote and co-produces the film, said: ''We are
working for next to nothing.
''We thought A Fish Called Wanda might make 25 million dollars in
America, and in fact it took 60 million dollars and 200 million dollars
worldwide.
''This is an immensely charming and moving movie like Four Weddings
and a Funeral. From the looks of the early rehearsals, it is not going
to be all a flop.
''The only places Wanda did not seem to do very well were in Portugal
and Japan, where they seem to be rather fish orientated.''
The new comedy -- its working title was Death Fish 2 but it is now
officially titled Fierce Creatures -- is about a small, idyllic English
zoo which is taken over by a multi-national corporation which tries to
tame the zookeepers as well as the animals.
Cleese said his inspiration came from meeting the late Mr Gerald
Durrell at his zoo in Jersey while making Monty Python.
''I have very few artistic qualms, as you can see by the number of
commercials I have done.
''There are a lot of fierce animals in this film and a lot of rather
fierce people as well,'' he said.
Jamie Lee Curtis was coy about whether she keeps her clothes on in the
new film. Asked if she had any pets herself, she burst out laughing
saying: ''Are you serious?''
Kevin Kline, who won an academy award for his role in the original
film seven years ago, said: ''This is an equal not a sequel.''
The film also features Maria Aitken, Robert Lindsay, Derek Griffiths,
and Ronnie Corbett and is set to be released next spring.

MEDIA tycoon Rupert Murdoch gave the editor of his flagship Sunday
tabloid a public rebuke yesterday after his paper was censured over a
story on the Countess Spencer's treatment at an addiction centre.
In a statement, Mr Murdoch said Mr Piers Morgan, the 30-year-old
editor of the News of the World, had gone ''over the top'' by publishing
the story.
Mr Murdoch said he had ''forcefully'' reminded Mr Morgan of his
responsibility to abide by the newspaper Code of Practice, which applies
to invasions of privacy.
''This company will not tolerate its papers bringing into disrepute
the best practices of popular journalism which we seek to follow,'' he
added.
Mr Murdoch's unprecedented outburst came only hours after the Press
Complaints Commission published adjudications upholding complaints by
Earl Spencer against both the News of the World and its MGN rival The
People.
The News of the World was found guilty of a ''serious breach'' of the
Code of Practice -- prompting commission chairman Lord Wakeham to write
to Mr Murdoch.
Mr Murdoch's statement said: ''While I will always support worthwhile
investigative journalism as a community responsibility, it is clear that
in this case the young man (Mr Morgan) went over the top.
''Mr Morgan has assured me that his forthcoming apology to Countess
Spencer on this matter is sincere and without reservation.
''I have no hesitation in making public this remonstration and I have
reminded Mr Morgan forcefully of his responsibility to the code to which
he as editor -- and all our journalists -- subscribe in their terms of
employment.''
Earl Spencer's complaints against the News of the World related to a
story covering the first three pages of its April 2 edition.
The article referred to Countess Spencer's ''secret therapy'' at the
clinic in Ockley, Surrey.
The commission said the story had gone into ''considerable detail''
about the countess's alleged problems and featured photographs of her
walking in the grounds of the clinic.
The News of the World had ''failed to offer any sufficient argument''
to support a defence of public interest and was ''guilty of a serious
breach of one of the most unequivocal parts of the Code of Practice''.
A separate statement from Mr Morgan said he took ''full
responsibility'' for the decision to publish the story and photograph.
He said he was sending his ''sincere apologies'' to the countess ''for
any distress that our actions may have caused at an obviously difficult
time for her'', and accepting the commission's adjudication ''without
reservation''.
He added: ''Mr Murdoch has made his feelings on this subject very
clear to me and I am determined that, as he says, the News of the World
will strive to maintain the best practices of popular investigative
journalism within the agreed parameters of the PCC's Code of Conduct.''
Earl Spencer later released a joint statement with his wife saying
they hoped the commission's ruling would help bring about a change in
the law.
Mrs Francis Shand-Kydd, mother-in-law of the countess, said at her
home in Scotland last night: ''I'm rather a happy girl today. I'm happy
for my family and every family that has been unfairly treated by the
media.''
In his letter to Mr Murdoch, Lord Wakeham said it was the commission's
view that the News of the World needed to review the way it applied
clause 18 of the Code of Practice.
This deals with the circumstances under which newspapers can justify
invading privacy or using subterfuge on grounds of public interest.
Lord Wakeham also told Mr Murdoch that the commission had considered
launching an investigation into how the News of the World obtained
information for a story about Tory MP Richard Spring, on April 2.
Mr Spring resigned as parliamentary aid to Northern Ireland Secretary
Sir Patrick Mayhew in the wake of ''three-in-a-bed'' sex allegations.
Lord Wakeham said the investigation never got under way after Mr
Spring indicated he did not wish to make a formal complaint.
In his complaints against the News of the World, Earl Spencer referred
to breaches of three clauses of the code; clause 4, regarding intrusion
into private lives, and use of long-lens photography; clause 6,
regarding the need for journalists to identify themselves properly in
hospitals; and clause 8, barring the use of intimidation or harassment.
All the alleged breaches complained of by Earl Spencer were upheld by
the commission.
The commission rejected claims by The People that its coverage of the
countess's treatment was justified because she had put the matter into
the public domain herself.
Another complaint by Earl Spencer against the Daily Mirror was found
to be ''resolved''.
The commission said Mirror editor, Mr Colin Myler, had accepted that
the photograph of the countess, which came from an agency, was published
in breach of the Code of Practice and should not have appeared, and
printed an apology.
0 A further complaint against the Mail on Sunday was rejected. The
newspaper had sent its medical correspondent and a photographer to the
clinic, who identified themselves ''in the correct manner'' and were
rebuffed.

A SECOND jury has made a large damages award to a former clay-pigeon
shooting champion whose sporting career was ended by an elbow injury.
The first award to Mr David Girvan of #193,080, which included
#120,000 for pain and suffering, was described as ''wholly extravagant''
by three appeal judges in the Court of Session, who allowed a retrial.
Yesterday, a different jury awarded #165,500 to Mr Girvan, a
five-times Scottish champion, with the pain and suffering (or solatium)
element reduced only slightly to #95,000.
The civil award for pain and suffering to Mr Girvan, is only #20,000
less than the record payout by a judge for a woman paralysed from the
neck down after road accident.
The case highlights a yawning gulf between the attitudes of the
Scottish judiciary and civil juries over appropriate levels of damages.
The highest award by a Scottish judge for pain and suffering to a
paraplegic is believed to be #70,000 and in December last year Lord
Penrose made a solatium award of #115,000 to quadriplegic, Mrs Elizabeth
Martin, who suffered catastrophic injuries after a lorry ploughed into
the back of her parked car. The total award in that case was #1.6m.
In allowing a retrial in Mr Girvan's case, Lord Ross, the Lord Justice
Clerk, said: ''We were informed that the highest award of solatium made
by a judge to a paraplegic was #70,000.
''Even if one assumes that for a quadriplegic an award in excess of
#100,000 for solatium might be justified, this appears to us to
demonstrate quite clearly that an award of #120,000 to Mr Girvan is
quite out of line with anything which has been awarded in the past.''
Mr Girvan, 45, from Glenmoriston in Inverness-shire, won a bronze
medal at the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games and became European
champion at his first attempt in 1988.
He raised a #250,000 damages action following an accident near his
home in which a van ran into his Land Rover. He suffered a serious
fracture and dislocation of his right elbow which ended his competitive
career as a clay-pigeon shooter.
In 1993, a jury at the Court of Session made the #193,000 award but an
appeal was lodged on the basis that the amount, particularly the
#120,000 for pain and suffering, was too high.
The appeal judges were told that the largest previous Scottish award
for an injury of the type suffered by Mr Girvan was #15,000.
Counsel for Mr Girvan argued that a judge in England might have
awarded about #40,000 for pain and suffering in a case like this and in
Mr Girvan's case it should be higher because of his inability to compete
any longer at the highest level of clay-pigeon shooting.
Reference was also made to huge libel awards in England and the large
pay-outs to pregnant ex-servicewomen.
However, Lord Ross said: ''When one considers previous awards in
England or Scotland, we are satisfied that the jury's award for solatium
in this case (and in consequence the award as a whole) must be regarded
as wholly extravagant.''
The new award might well be regarded in the same light and raises the
question of what happens next to the case.
Appeal against a civil jury award in the Court of Session is by way of
a motion for a new trial and raises the possibility that a jury may have
to hear Mr Girvan's case for the third time.
In theory, there is no limit to the number of times the case could be
heard.

MINISTERS and MPs are facing the biggest shake-up for more than a
century in the rules governing their behaviour, following yesterday's
publication of the Nolan Committee's report on standards in public life.
The 10-member committee, set up by the Prime Minister to counter
allegations of financial impropriety or ''sleaze'' in Parliament, found
no evidence of systematic corruption but called for tighter rules to
reassure the public.
The Government's detailed response to the report is not expected until
it is debated in the Commons next week but Mr John Major said he
accepted its ''broad thrust''.
The main recommendations include:
* A ban on MPs working for lobbying companies;
* Full disclosure of MPs' earnings and contracts for providing
parliamentary services;
* Cabinet Ministers to seek permission for taking private-sector jobs
within two years of leaving office;
* A Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to deal with rule
breaches and complaints;
* A Public Appointments Commissioner to control membership of quangos.
The Prime Minister faces an embarrassing clash with the Nolan
Committee if he tries to block any move by it to investigate the funding
of political parties.
While both sides of the Commons gave a general welcome to the Nolan
report, more guarded on the Tory side, Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw
said the committee ''cannot get to the heart of concern about sleaze
unless it grasps the nettle of political funding.
''It must now examine the secrecy which surrounds the funding of the
Conservative Party and the nexus between secret financial donations,
favours, and patronage.''
Mr Robert Maclennan, for the Liberal Democrats, supported his call,
although he added that trade union bankrolling of the Labour Party
should also be scrutinised.
The Prime Minister could seal off that avenue of inquiry but it would
be at some cost to the image of his Government and party.
The Cabinet could have some difficulty with the recommendation that
for two years after leaving office Ministers should require clearance
from an independent body before joining private companies. However, they
would face an outcry if they rejected or tried to modify it.
Back-bench Conservative MPs appeared to accept that the days of what
Lord Nolan called ''MPs for hire'' were over as far as being employed by
or as members of a lobbying organisation which could ask them to
represent the interests of a variety of clients.
Some, however, have seized on the less specific recommendation that
the holding of consultancies by MPs should only be reviewed. They argue
that for an MP to represent specific organisations with which they have
a one-to-one arrangement should continue to be permited if payments to
the Member are listed in the Register of Members' Interests.
There would be fierce opposition from some Tories if an attempt was
made to prevent MPs from representing any organisation for a fee. MPs
have traditionally acted as paid spokesmen for bodies like the Police
Federation and a range of trade and business organisations.
Mr Straw said the report justified Opposition criticism of Government
sleaze which had forced reluctant Ministers to set up the inquiry.
However, in the Commons, the Prime Minister accused the Opposition of
regularly making general smears about specific matters and pointed out
that the report said the general level of behaviour among public
servants was high.
He angrily rejected a call by Mr Gordon Prentice (Pendle-Lab) for him
to take ''full and personal responsibiliuty for the tide of sleaze that
has engulfed his Government''.
Mr Prentice said it was ''quite wrong for Ministers to move seamlessly
from the Cabinet room to the boardroom, lining their pockets in the
process.''
Mr Robert Maclennan said people would be heartened to see that
Parliament, given the chance, could recommend stiff measures to police
MPs.
Lord Nolan gave a blunt warning that MPs must put themselves above all
accusations of sleaze and wrong-doing.
''Parliament is the cornerstone of our democracy. If standards of
conduct in Parliament command public confidence, nothing much can go
wrong,'' he said.
''If they don't, nothing much can go right and the whole edifice could
crumble.''
In a letter to the Prime Minister, he said changes in the way
politicians and civil servants worked had wrongly led to an impression
of widespread misconduct.
''Unless corrective measures are promptly taken, there is a danger
that anxiety and suspicion will give way to disillusion and growing
cynicism,'' he warned.
The committee's recommendations should go a long way to calming public
concerns about MPs allegedly using their position to line their pockets,
ex-Ministers taking advantage of their knowledge to accept lucrative
jobs in the City, and claims that quangoes have been packed with Tory
supporters.
However, there is a widespread belief among MPs that parliamentary
salaries -- which start at around #31,000 for back benchers -- already
scare off top-class candidates, who know they can make more money in the
private sector.

Mr Jimmy Wilson handed the horses to security men in the foyer while
he was appearing two floors above to fight a district council
application to the court to order him to keep farm animals from
straying.
Mr Wilson, 52, of Kenmuir Farm, Mount Vernon, Glasgow, is charged that
on November 24 last, he conducted himself in a disorderly manner and
committed a breach of the peace. His solicitor, Mr Desmond McCaffrey,
told a preliminary pleading diet yesterday he was objecting to the

SCOTTISH Office Ministers today will be urged to support a three-year
freeze on rail cuts amid warnings that the Government's privatisation
programme is in a mess.
The moratorium, to allow a breathing space to prove the railways in
Scotland can pay, was proposed last night by Mr Bill Anderson, Scottish
secretary of the Federation of Small Businesses.
He told a fringe meeting at the Scottish Tories' conference, in
Glasgow, that the rail network could be saved by convincing people to
''use it or lose it''.
Mr Anderson argued that the business community and tourist industry
should be allowed time to prove the viability of Scotland's railways --
facing budget cuts of at least 5%, with more to come in subsequent
years.
The bid for a three- year ban on cuts, linked to a massive marketing
campaign to boost useage and exploit tourist potential, was supported by
the STUC and the Scottish Tourist Board.
It will be lodged formally with Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish
Minister for Transport and Tourism, at the conference later today.
The plea to preserve services coincided with Mr Richard Hope,
consultant editor of the influential Railway Gazette, declaring that the
privatisation programme was ''in a mess''.
He predicted great difficulties and delays in ScotRail and other train
operating companies meeting the franchising timetable set by Government.
The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising said yesterday that formal
invitations to tender for Scottish services were expected to be issued
by late summer.
Opraf also said it expected ''soon'' to issue the minimum passenger
service requirements for ScotRail, with an announcement certainly before
the end of May.
However, Mr Hope warned that ScotRail and other train operators would
face major problems in convincing banks to provide working capital
against the background of uncertainty -- and fear -- in the
privatisation process.
He argued that too many fixed costs were outwith the operators'
control, including access charges to Railtrack and leases of rolling
stock, at a time when cuts in subsidy were being made.
Mr Hope went on: ''The great problem for train operating companies is
that they cannot manage their businesses when the Rail Regulator, the
franchise director, and the Government are all telling them exactly what
to do.''
He predicted that new ScotRail director John Ellis, after lodging
pre-qualification documents for the franchise to run trains in Scotland,
would see the bid through.
He claimed Mr Ellis and other heads of train operating units were
under ''enormous pressure'' to tender for franchises, especially after
three directors, including ScotRail's Chris Green, resigned recently.
At the Tory fringe meeting, North Tayside Tory MP Bill Walker blamed
the Fort William sleeper ills on failures to realise the West Highland
line's potential.
He said the problem with BR was that it was monolithic, and local
managements were unable to exercise discretionary powers allowed under
free-enterprise organisations.
Storm, the anti-privatisation action group, yesterday warned that the
reprieve for the sleeper was but a small part of its campaign for change
to prevent ''irreparable damage to the railways.''

THE launch of a new populist Conservative political movement in
Scotland by elder statesmen from Glasgow's Cathcart constituency blew up
in their faces yesterday when they were condemned on all sides of the
Tory party.
The launch of the self-styled Declaration of Cathcart turned ugly when
present office bearers from the constituency and young Tories attending
the conference broke in on their press announcement to accuse them of
the party equivalent of treason.
However, while there was no doubt that the declaration was a sincere
move to nudge the Tories towards a more populist and electable approach,
it was easy for the hierarchy to dismiss as cranks the authors, in spite
of their combined 182 years of service to the party.
While Bailie John Young, a leading light of the group, insisted that
all they wanted to do was spark off a forward-looking debate in the
party, the president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Association, Mr David McLetchie, said he was bewildered by their
outburst and questioned their motives.
''I am rather disappointed that a few people who are unrepresentative
chose to skulk in the back corridors rather than come to the platform. I
must say I think their ideas are a dreadful mish-mash.''
The row came as Scottish Secretary Ian Lang dismissed suggestions that
the Tories may be about to attempt a U-turn on their constitutional
stance. In his speech and subsequent comments, he made itclear that this
was not his intention -- a stance which is set to be confirmed by Prime
Minister John Major in his address to conference later today.
Mr Major gave a clear indication of that in an interview for BBC
Scotland, in which he indicated there would be no shift on the
constitutional question.
''I believe that devolution would prove to be a route on the way to an
independent Scotland and I believe that an independent Scotland would be
very bad for Scotland and for the Scots and I believe it would also be
very bad for the rest of the United Kingdom,'' he said.
However, the Cathcart Declaration pointed in a different direction.
The five past chairmen of the constituency -- who stressed they were
speaking in a personal capacity -- made their number one priority the
calling of a multi-choice referendum on the constitution.
However, as they were outlining their case in the restaurant of the
Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow, a member of the current Cathcart
executive, Mr Bill Thomas, burst in and yelled that they were a disgrace
and should be thrown out of the party. He was joined by several young
Conservatives.
The five remained defiant, claiming that if the party did not listen
to what was being said on the doorsteps, they were facing electoral
annihalation.
In last night's interview, Mr Major issued a defiant prediction that
he would lead the Tories to victory at the next General Election. He
brushed aside all talk of a challenge to his leadership.

Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson has written to the Transport
Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney complaning of the ''vindictive and
irrational'' decision to take Motorail off the Fort William sleeper.
Mr McPherson tells Dr Mawhinney that this decision by the British
Railways Board in the wake of Lord Kirkwood's reprieve for the sleeper
service represented a poor bargain for the taxpayer, given that the
train was going to run anyway.
Mr McPherson also sent a letter to Mr John Welsby, chairman and chief
executive of the British Railways Board, saying that many thought the
withdrawal of the Motorail cars was spiteful.

A LAW and order initiative to put 258 extra policemen on the beat,
together with grants for mental health and child care, has been put on
hold because of Government indecision on whether or not to cap
Strathclyde region's budget.
Senior councillors and officials have warned that any attempt by
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to claw back the #34m more than Government
guidelines that the region plans to spend would involve a massive
council tax re-billing exercise which in itself would cost #300,000.
It is also feared this would disrupt payments, leading to a shortfall
of up to #2m in lost interest.
The region's concern follows claims that Mr Lang has come under fire
in Cabinet over its decision to breach the revenue capping level by
#34m, although the council has absorbed this into its capital budget.
Some English Ministers seem unable to contemplate Strathclyde getting
away with its overspend when eight English councils face capping.
The region has already threatened legal action against the Secretary
of State if he forces it to meet his full #107m of cuts solely from
revenue. The council contends this would involve 5000 compulsory
redundancies.
Yesterday, the council's policy and resources committee decided to
defer a #5m package of expenditure, pending a Scottish Office decision
on capping.
However, the Labour administration has urged Mr Lang to come up with a
decision quickly and end the uncertainty.
The region's finance chairman, Councillor John Mullin said: ''What was
delayed this morning as a matter of prudence was a #5m package covering
what we consider to be essential areas of service, providing much-needed
development to very vulnerable client groups pending a Government
decisionon capping. This is not gesture politics. It's not playing games
with the Secretary of State.''
However, the prospect of carrying out another budget exercise and
having to issue new council-tax bills was clearly an awesome one for the
council to contemplate.
Director of finance Archibald Gillespie said: ''That would be a
mammoth task and it would cost about #300,000. But it also has very
severe cash-flow implications. As soon as people hear there's going to
be a new billing, they stop paying.''
Councillor Mullin further warned that if the finance department had to
devote time to re-billing, that would stop it doing other work relating
to local government reorganisation.
''The message to Ian Lang is -- if you cap us, you put the whole
reorganisation process at risk,'' Councillor Mullin said.
