YOUR editorial ''Blair at Brighton'' (October 2) not only completely
misses the message of Braveheart, but more importantly insults the
intelligence of the Scottish electorate.
To claim that ''the voters of this country wish to flock to the
support of the SNP because they have been enthralled by the acting of a
small Australian and the scenery of Ireland'' is pathetic, patronising
poppycock; unworthy of a journal which claims to be ''Scotland's
Independent Newspaper''.
The people of Scotland are flocking to the SNP banner because
Braveheart fills an important vacuum in the Scottish people's knowledge
of their own history. I have taught in Scottish schools for over 20
years and well know the neglect of Scottish history in the classroom;
especially the period covering the Scottish Wars of Independence.
Thanks to insidious unionism which permeates all levels of Scotland's
educational system, the people of Scotland are largely ignorant of their
country's history. For all its historical inaccuracies, Braveheart goes
some way in redressing the balance.
The SNP is to be congratulated on capitalising on the message of
Braveheart. The spirit of Wallace has always lived in those Scots who
would see their country free; thanks to Mel Gibson, that spirit, the
story and struggle of a great patriot, is now released among the general
population.
It is little wonder that Labour stoop to the politics of the gutter in
a vain attempt to stem the nationalist tidal wave.

RANGERS' injured youngster, Charlie Miller, was handed a major career
boost by Scotland team manager Craig Brown yesterday.
The 19-year-old Ibrox midfielder was not named in either of Brown's
squads for Sweden next week, but Brown took time to expound on Miller's
talents and what they may yet mean to his country.
He said: ''I spoke to Walter Smith about the Charlie Miller's injury,
but even before that conversation, I had decided that I would not use
any of the Under-21 players in either the full or the B teams in Sweden
next week.
''We really do feel that we have a great chance of winning the
European Under-21 title with this squad. Honestly, there are so many
good players who are available and Charlie is just one of them.
''But, young as he is, Charlie could be the man who could help the
team win the title because of all the experience he is currently picking
up playing in the Champions' League.
Twenty-four hours before Brown's comments Rangers manager Smith had
said that Miller would need rest because of shin injury complications.

DUNDEE United followed Celtic's transfer-market lead yesterday and
placed a #2m price tag on their Scotland international midfielder, Billy
McKinlay.
The Tannadice club rejected a bid of around #1.6m from English
champions Blackburn Rovers after top-level talks between the clubs.
Just as Celtic turned down an offer of almost #3m for John Collins,
and asked for another half-million, so the Tayside club decided they
also wanted more cash for one of their main assets.
I understand that Blackburn, like Middlesbrough, are ready to pull out
of the transfer and look elsewhere.
Any decision which would leave the transfer-seeking McKinlay at
Tannadice for much longer would endanger any future transfer dealings
the club may set up.
The player, who snatched a derby hat trick at the weekend, has
initiated a Court of Session action against the club in regard to his
long-term contract. If McKinlay wins his court case, it could be that he
will become a free agent.
That would mean United losing out on any kind of transfer fee, and the
player may be willing to go to the wall on this one now that a transfer
to the Premiership has been blocked.

COMMUNICADO are, above all else, consummate story-tellers, with an
admirable track record in rooting out tales which are well worth the
telling. Athol Fugard's play, based on the true story of Pavel
Navrotsky, a Red Army deserter who remained hidden in his own pig sty
for 44 years, certainly fits this tradition. It's a bizarre and
beguiling tale, rich in dramatic potential, strong in mythic qualities
and universal resonance.
This is a substantially re-worked version; it has been given, since
first staged by the company, new music, a new set and lighting design,
making it to all intents and purposes a new production. I must confess
to missing the first rendition, but the classically Brechtian aesthetics
of Kenneth Glennan's direction, here work effectively to create a sense
of the epic quality of the piece, together with the feel of rural,
war-torn Eastern Europe.
A trio of raucous brass-players, owing not a little to the music of
Kurt Weill, punctuate the action, heightening moments of tension and
poignancy, and providing the utterly convincing sound effects of the
ever-present grunting and squealing pigs. Karen Tennant's evocative set
of dirt-caked hessian, corrugated iron, worn and rotting timbers, pays
more than a nodding reference to the work of Brecht's favourite
designer, and each scene is signposted with a hand-painted caption.
Gerry Mulgrew, as Pavel, and Gerda Stevenson, as his pragmatic and
long-suffering wife, put in performances which succeed in portraying
believable and convincing characters in this extraordinary,
credibility-stretching tale, and ultimately, in providing a moving and
uplifting allegory of hope.

THE Scottish Badminton Open, the third-oldest Open tournament in the
world, could be under threat this year through lack of sponsorship.
''The Scottish Open is struggling financially,'' revealed Anne
Smillie, chief executive of the SBU. ''We have some support already from
Glasgow City Council but, apart from that, it's bleak news. The event
has been running since 1907 and is one of the top 12 tournaments in the
world at present.''
Sixteen countries have already indicated that they wish to come to
Glasgow for the November event, but without a quick injection of funds
the badminton feast at the Kelvin Hall may be in jeopardy.
Smillie has pledged that the event will go ahead in some form. ''Come
what may, there will be a Scottish Open but if we can't find the prize
fund of $15,000, we lose our place on the International Badminton
Federation circuit as a one-star tournament.''
However, Smillie believes that if anyone can save an event, it will be
the SBU. ''We brought in the biggest-ever sponsorship package by any
Badminton Union in Europe for the 1992 European Championships,'' she
explained.
However, television have again expressed no interest in covering the
Scottish Open. ''It's a disgrace,'' fumed Smillie.

TERRY Griffiths won the battle of the Welsh dragons to reach the
quarter-finals of the Thailand Classic in Bangkok yesterday.
Griffiths defeated Darren Morgan 5-0 in a one-sided contest and next
tackles world champion Stephen Hendry -- who has won all their previous
14 matches.
''I've nothing to lose against the best player in the world,'' said
Griffiths. ''Every ranking point I get these days is a bonus, I'm just
happy I'm still involved in the tournament.''
Griffiths is wearing glasses this season for the first time. ''I knew
I had to, I just couldn't focus properly,'' he explained. ''Last season
I really struggled with my eyes.''
Joe Swail, a former English amateur champion, defeated Jimmy White 5-3
to claim his first victory over the world No.7 in four attempts.
Manchester-based Swail, ranked No.18 but having been in the top 16
last season, admitted that a somewhat wayward lifestyle had not helped
his snooker.
''I was going to too many discos and drinking far too much beer for my
own good. I knew I had to get my act together to survive at this
level,'' said the 26-year-old Irishman.
He added: ''I've cut down on the night-outs and the drinking as well,
and instead got my head down at the practice table. I can't grumble so
far and when you have taken out a top player like Jimmy, your confidence
is bound to soar.''
Local hero James Wattana bowed out to Worcester's Dave Finbow, who led
3-0 but lost four frames in a row before hitting back with a break of
107 and then winning the decider. John Parrott also had a 5-4 victory,
after having led 3-0 and 4-2 against Malta's Tony Drago.

DUNDEE United, who have been particularly hard hit by injuries this
season -- eight Tannadice men have been out with long-term knocks --
were given good news yesterday on the eve of their League Challenge Cup
semi-final against Dunfermline at East End Park.
Sandy Robertson, the former Rangers midfielder who joined United in
the summer, could be back after an ankle injury.
Said manager, Billy Kirkwood: ''We still have plenty of major worries,
but it is progress to have someone like Sandy coming back again.''
Kirkwood also lists youngsters Paul Walker and David Mitchell in the
squad, but Steven Pressley and Billy McKinlay look sure to miss out
through injury, while Kelham O'Hanlon will take over in goal from Ally
Maxwell.
Dunfermline's Allan Moore is out with an Achilles heel problem and
Marc Millar, too, because of a knee injury.
Veteran Graeme Armstrong bids to make his first appearance in a major
cup final after 21 years in football. He will be at the centre of the
defence for Stenhousemuir for their local-derby cup clash with Stirling
Albion, and he revealed last night: ''It would be a major achievement
for me and for the club to get to the final.
''Stirling was my first senior club and I had six happy years with
them. Since then I have been with Berwick, then Meadowbank, and now on
to Stenhousemuir.''
Albion manager Kevin Drinkell has a fully fit squad and says: ''I was
in the Falkirk side which won this competition, and would like to lift
the trophy again as a manager.''

SCOTLAND will play in a World Cup sevens, 24-team qualifying
tournament in Dubai next November with eight sides going on to the
finals in Hong Kong in 1997.
The Dubai qualifier also features Wales, Fiji, South Africa, Tonga,
USA, and Italy plus a host of junior nations, so both home nations will
be expected to qualify comfortably.
Only three sides are exempt from the qualification rounds, hosts Hong
Kong plus England and Australia, the finalists from the inaugural
tournament at Murrayfield in 1993.
The other 64 Unions in membership of the International Rugby Football
Board will compete for the remaining 21 Hong Kong places at three
qualifying rounds. In addition to the Dubai event, qualifiers will be
held in Lisbon in June and in Punta del Este, Uruguay in January, 1997.
Ireland start their bid to reach the finals in the Lisbon tournament
alongside the All Blacks and 18 minor European rugby nations.
RWC director Keith Rowlands said: ''Each of these tournaments is in
itself a mini RWC, which will test to the full the ability of the teams
involved as well as the local organisers.
''For some of the nations involved this will be their first appearance
in a world event and, hopefully, help the development and promotion of
the game in their own countries. In order to facilitate the presence of
all IRFB countries, irrespective of their strength and financial means,
all participants in the three qualifying rounds will be transported and
accommodated at the expense of the organisers.'' Details:
Lisbon, Portugal (June 1996). Eight from 24 participants qualify:
Ireland, New Zealand, Spain, South Korea, Canada, Namibia, Romania,
Latvia, Portugal, Poland, Georgia, Ukraine, Israel, Belgium, Moldova,
Norway, Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Switzerland, Austria,
Andorra, Luxembourg.
Dubai, United Arab Emirates (November 1996). (Eight from 24): Fiji,
South Africa, Tonga, Wales, Scotland, United States, Italy, Taiwan,
Arabian Gulf, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Russia, Malaysia, Botswana, Singapore, Zambia, Sri
Lanka, Thailand, Yugoslavia.
Punta Del Este, Uruguay (January 1997). (Five from 16): Western Samoa,
Argentina, Japan, France, Netherlands, Uruguay, Cook Islands, Germany,
Bahamas, Bermuda, Chile, Paraguay, Sweden, Tahiti, Papua New Guinea,
Trinidad and Tobago.
* WORLD Cup director Marcel Martin has confirmed that qualifying
commitments for the 1999 tournament would be kept to a minimum for
England, Ireland, and Scotland, underlining SRU IB representative Fred
McLeod's recent comment that, while the details are not yet known,
Scotland should not find the process too onerous.
France qualify as play-off winners in South Africa, and Wales qualify
automatically as hosts after they trailed around Europe last year to
gain entry for the 1995 event in South Africa. The other major European
nations expect to play no more than two games in order to qualify.
''We know that the big unions have a crowded fixture list and it is
not the intention of Rugby World Cup to over-crowd that list,'' said
Martin, who has also suggested a participation fee for the 20 nations
which assemble in Europe for World Cup '99.
The World Cup organisers confirmed that the South Africa tournament's
commercial programme generated a gross income of #30.3m, with an overall
surplus of #22.1m which is almost double the figure achieved in 1991.
The total income was almost #46m.
About #4.5m of the surplus has gone to the South African Rugby
Football Union with #3m going to the nine provincial unions in SA as
venue fees.
The remaining #17.6m, after deduction of expenses involved in
organising the 1987 RWC Sevens and the 1999 tournament, will be used for
development of the game worldwide.

NO SOONER had Scotland team manager Craig Brown named his full and
''B'' international squads for friendly games in Sweden next week than
his plans were hit last night by injuries to Rangers' Ally McCoist and
Leeds' Gary McAllister.
McCoist was taken off as Rangers beat Motherwell 2-1 at Ibrox and a
groin injury will rule him out of the trip to Sweden. Scotland skipper
McAllister also looks set to miss out after hurting his ankle as Leeds
edged out Notts County in the Coca-Cola Cup. McAllister had put Leeds on
the way to their 3-2 win.
Earlier in the day, it was clear that Scotland will embark on a search
for a strike force in Sweden. Brown yesterday named his players for the
two games -- 37 in all, and not including Richard Gough.
Brown named FIVE strikers in his main squad and TWO more in his ''B''
group and he insisted: ''It is the one area which still concerns me as
we try to build towards the (European championship) finals -- if we do
get there. Between now and the summer we have to get a pairing with the
proper chemistry. We used to have that at one time.
''There was a spell when Scotland could just name Mo Johnston and Ally
McCoist and that was that. It has not been as simple for some time . .
.''
Indeed, while Brown has had a consistency of selection available to
him in defence and in midfield, the main attacking positions have
remained a nagging worry. Injuries and loss of form have contributed to
these problems, as Brown pointed out: ''We have missed out so often on
the opportunity of having a settled pairing up front. Scott Booth and
McCoist were both out for almost the whole of last season. And we still
don't have Duncan Ferguson available right now.
''But it is a partnership we are looking for and, at the moment, Booth
is the man we are looking to, because he has come back so well. But
there are others, too, and we have to look at them over a few matches
before we can decide.''
In fact, Brown won't have too many games between now and the finals.
He has these games in Sweden; the match against San Marino, the last in
the qualifying group; twin fixtures with Denmark, the same as next
week's Scandinavian exercise, in April; and, perhaps, three more
preparatory games. One of these would be at home, the others away.
As for the absent Gough, Brown still refused to elaborate on his
reasons for omitting the Rangers skipper. He said simply: ''If I do ever
decide to select Richard Gough for a Scotland squad, then I shall call a
press conference and tell everyone. I will make a statement then. At the
moment, however, Richard Gough has not been named in either of these
squads. I am quite happy with my defensive set-up.''
Brown's comments won't defuse the situation, but he has again made it
quite plain that no matter what club form Gough shows at Ibrox, he will
not play for his country again.
However, while Brown stood by his trusted squad members, one of his
backroom staff, Partick Thistle manager Murdo MacLeod, spelled out a
threat to the seemingly established men.
MacLeod will be in charge of the ''B'' team along with his former
Celtic team-mate Tommy Burns and he looked at the players available to
him yesterday and smiled: ''This is a strong group of players, with
quite a few who have already won international honours, and they will be
out to prove to the main squad men that they want to be in the finals if
Scotland are there.''
Brown also took time yesterday to assess Scotland's qualifying hopes.
He stressed that a Russian victory over Greece next week would assure
Scotland of second place in the group. He added: ''The six best
second-placed teams go through and we believe that we will be in that
group. At the moment I reckon there are several countries whose records
will be worse than the one we have.
''It will be decided on results against the other leading teams in the
group and we have 11 points out of a possible 18 with a goal difference
of plus three.''
Friendly v Sweden in Stockholm next Wednesday:
Booth (Aberdeen), Boyd (Celtic), Calderwood (Spurs), Collins (Celtic),
Goram (Rangers), Hendry (Blackburn), Jackson (Hibernian), Leighton
(Hibernian), McAllister (Leeds), McCall (Rangers), McCoist (Rangers),
McGinlay (Bolton), McKimmie (Aberdeen), McKinlay (Dundee Utd), McLaren
(Rangers), McStay (Celtic), Nevin (Tranmere), Robertson (Hearts).
B international v Sweden in Gavle next Tuesday:
Bernard (Aberdeen), Burley (Chelsea), Cameron (Raith), Creaney (Man
City), Gemmill (Nottm Forest), Gunn (Norwich), Jess (Aberdeen), Lambert
(Motherwell), Martin (Motherwell), McKeown (Crusaders), McKinlay
(Celtic), McKinnon (Motherwell), Rae (Millwall), Shearer (Aberdeen),
Telfer (Coventry), Tweed (Hibernian), Walker (Partick), Whyte
(Middlesbrough), Wright (Rangers).

RUGBY LEAGUE
A FIJIAN tribal war dance yesterday gave the Rugby League's World Cup
a big lift-off in Manchester.
Flags of all 10 participating nations were on parade at Old Trafford
and the four members of the Fijian National Dance Theatre, clad in
tribal costume added to the splendour of the occasion.
Tournament organiser Maurice Lindsay reported that 122,000 tickets had
been sold before the competition starts, nearly 24,000 of those for
Saturday's opener between England and Australia at Wembley.
Lindsay is confident there will be at least 30,000 fans at Wembley and
again defended the decision to take the first World Cup game to the
national stadium rather that to a northern venue.
''It is the centenary of the game and it deserved a big stage,'' he
said.
''There aren't that many major stadiums that could be used and we
decided to go to Wembley because it is a regular rugby league ground
that we have used since 1929. We are doing the right thing going to
London. It's not a brave step -- it's the right step in our view.''

ENGLAND ROUND-UP
ALEX Ferguson, the Manchester United manager, said he had no
complaints after his side crashed to a 4-3 aggregate defeat against
second division York in their Coca-Cola Cup second-round clash at
Bootham Crescent.
United, trailing 3-0 from the first leg at Old Trafford, raced into a
2-0 lead within 13 minutes, with goals from Paul Scholes and Terry
Cooke. But Scott Jordan pulled one back for York and United could only
reply through another Scholes strike after 79 minutes.
''York fought very hard for their victory -- the same way they did at
Old Trafford,'' said Fergurson. ''We were 2-0 up earlier on but rarely
took our foot off the pedal. We got careless and that's why we are out.
''We were casual and suffered for it -- I have no complaints.''
Eric Cantona -- playing his first away match since January, took just
six minutes to make his mark on the tie, picking out Scholes inside the
box and the youngster finished off well. But it was York's night.
0 Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear threatened to rip his side apart after
they crashed out of the tournament at Charlton. ''We gave away Mickey
Mouse goals,'' said Kinnear, after his side's 8-7 aggregate defeat.
''The full-backs cost us two goals and I can't remember any team
scoring eight goals against us in my five years in charge. I have been
loyal to the players so far but now it's time to act. I suppose it must
have been a great match to watch but from my point of view the last goal
was a real sickener.''
Ray Wilkins, manager of Queens Park Rangers, was a relieved man after
Kevin Gallen had given the Londoners an extra-time winner against
Oxford.
''If we had approached the game in the right manner and competed from
the start we could have won it in 90 minutes,'' said Wilkins, after his
side had won 2-1 to complete a 3-2 aggregate win.
An extra-time winner from Jim Gannon gave Division 2 Stockport a
deserved victory over Ipswich, Stockport going through 3-2 on aggregate,
while keeper Kevin Miller was Watford's hero when he saved three penalty
shoot-out spot-kicks to help his side through to the third round.

ANGEL Beltre, of the Dominican Republic, will be out to wreck the
plans of Glasgow's Gary Jacobs when he tackles Eamonn Loughran for the
World Boxing Organisation welterweight title in Belfast on Saturday.
Jacobs, who failed in a recent attempt to take the World Boxing
Council crown from American Pernell Whitaker, is still confident he can
win a world championship and the best route for him would be a meeting
with Loughran, a fight which would generate huge interest in Britain.
But Beltre, whose hopes of taking Loughran's crown in May ended when a
clash of heads left him in a bloody mess, is convinced that Loughran
will no longer have the title after Saturday.
After that first meeting, the WBO ordered a rematch, and after two
operations to clear up the eye damage, the Domincan Republic boxer is
determined not to make the same mistake again.
''I'm going to be a lot more careful this time, because he's so
dangerous with the head,'' he explained. ''I never felt one of his
punches last time and I intend to bring home the title to the Dominican
Republic. He's a strong fighter, but that's all.
''I'm a more intelligent fighter than Loughgran and he will not be
able to do what he did the last time.''
Beltre, a world amateur champion at 17, will offer a much sterner
challenge than Loughran's last opponent, American Tony Gannarelli, who
was stopped in six rounds.
''I was baiting him in the first fight until the third round, when I
began to take control until Loughran butted me,'' he added.
''I was going to win the world title until that happened, but I've
worked on the way he fights and he won't do it this time.''
* HENRY Wharton has his sights set on a world title showdown with
Steve Collins or Nigel Benn. And the York-based fighter is drawing
inspiration from Frank Bruno as he looks forward to a third crack at the
world super-middleweight crown.
Wharton, who makes the first defence of his European title against Sam
Storey, of Belfast, in Halifax on November 11, has been beaten by Benn
and Chris Eubank in his two world title fights to date, but he says: ''I
was beaten by two of the best fighters to come out of this country --
two of the best fighters in the world.
''I had a little bit to learn when I had my two world title shots --
about myself as much as anything else. But I'm still young in boxing
terms. Look at Frank Bruno -- that was his fourth attempt and this would
only be my third.''
Wharton insists though that he is not taking his assignment with
Storey lightly.
He said: ''Storey, as a tall southpaw, is going to be very awkward,
but I'm not looking for a knock-out, just to win the fight.''
* ROBBIE Regan's bid to regain the British flyweight title from old
rival Frances Ampofo has been postponed because of a car crash suffered
by the Welshman.
The fight was due to take place on October 25 in Cardiff, but Regan's
training programme has been disrupted following the crash, in which he
and his wife sustained whiplash injuries.

the age of 13 and is in good shape as he starts a new job as lead horse
at Whitcombe Manor stables.
''He looks absolutely fantastic, as though he could win another Gold
Cup,'' said owner Peter Bolton. ''People have asked me why not win one
or two of the military races with him. But although I am sure he's
capable of doing it, what on earth would people say if he was to fall
and break his neck?
''He is one of racing's unsung heroes and never really got the credit
he deserved for winning the Gold Cup -- nearly all the talk was about
the horses he beat in the race.''
Cool Ground, trained at the time by Toby Balding, was a 25-1 outsider
when he landed the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in 1992 by a short head from
The Fellow. He gave jockey Adrian Maguire victory with his first ride in
the race.
But post-race press coverage centred on the eclipse of favourite
Carvill's Hill, amid accusations that Golden Freeze was run as a
''stalking horse'' by Jenny Pitman.
Cool Ground also won the Kim Muir Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in
1989, when trained by Richard Mitchell.
His career tally of #279,000 in prize money was bolstered by victories
in the Coral Welsh National at Chesptow in 1990 for Reg Akehurst and
successive runnings of the Anthony Mildmay Peter Cazalet Chase at
Sandown in 1990 and 1991 for Mitchell and Akehurst respectively.
Jockey Maguire also paid tribute to Cool Ground, saying: ''It was
great to win the Gold Cup on him in 1992. That was one of the highlights
of my career.''
* LAMMTARRA was yesterday officially rated the best winner of the Prix
de l'Arc de Triomphe since Suave Dancer in 1991.
And British Horseracing Board official handicapper Nigel Gray believes
that the colt is almost certainly better than his current rating. ''Who
knows what he can do? It is very, very difficult to estimate how good he
is.
''We've come up with a rating of 130, but we don't believe that is all
he is worth or that that is all he is capable of.
''He is an unbeaten horse who has never won by more than a length but
keeps improving and doing enough -- if I was a private handicapper I
would rate him with a plus or a p.
''I dealt with a similar case last year of a horse who never won by
very far, Star Rage. I kept putting him up a little more and he would
come out and win by half a length again. He became a handicapper's
nightmare.
''Lammtarra's rating is centred around fourth-placed Lando -- who was
beaten under three lengths in the race last year -- and the fifth, Pure
Grain, who was rated 118 for her run in the Irish Oaks.
''People will compare Lammtarra with the Dancing Braves of this world
and say he must be rated more than 130, but we won't know how good he is
until he is beaten.''
Lammtarra's rating is higher than the official assessment of the last
three Arc winners, Carnegie (126), Urban Sea (125), and Subotica (128).
But he is still some way adrift of 1991 winner Suave Dancer (136) and
Dancing Brave, who earned a rating of 141 after his victory in 1986.

SCOTLAND will be without two of the players who helped them take the
runners-up spot in the European Team championships in Milan in July when
they open their challenge for honours in the Women's Home International
series at Wrexham this morning.
Janice Moodie and Mhairi McKay are both at university in America, but
it is still a strong side which takes on England today in the opening
match. Tomorrow the Scots face Ireland and on Friday they line up
against Wales.
Alison Rose and Lesley Nicholson go into action first this morning
against the top English pairing of British champion Julie Hall and Lisa
Walton. Lindsey Roxburgh and Anne Laing are the second pairing with
Jayne Ford and Sharon McMaster forming the third.
Scottish captain Gladys Cadden, who will name her singles line-up at
lunchtime, says she is quite happy with the way practice has gone over
the past two days on this tough course. Foursomes pairings:
Scotland v England (Scottish players first) -- A Rose (Stirling) and L
Nicholson (Haddington) v J Hall (Felixstowe Ferry) and L Walton (Calcot
Park); L Roxburgh (Tain) and A Laing (Vale of Leven) v E Duggleby
(Malton and Norton) and E Fields (Falmouth); J Ford (Gullane) and S
McMaster (Dunbar) v E Ratcliffe (Sandiway) and K Stupples (Royal Cinque
Ports).
* MUIR of Ord duo, Sandy Ross and Brian Cuthbertson, endured a trip
into 'Hell' at St Andrews yesterday but still came up smiling as winners
of the Famous Grouse Shotgun Foursomes International Final.
They looked to have lost any chance of victory when they ignored the
advice of their caddies and tried to drive over Hell Bunker on the
fourteenth fairway of the Old Course. But, as other have found, that is
easier said than done, and once free of the sand, they had to settle for
a double-bogey 7.
However, they kept their composure and a steady finish, which included
a pitch-and-putt par 4 at the seventeenth, saw them home one point ahead
of the County Antrim duo, Eugene McMullan and Dan McAuley. Leading
scores:
0
69[1/2] -- Muir of Ord (S Ross, B Cuthbertson, 13[1/2]). 70[1/2] --
Cushendall (E McMullan, D McAuley, 10[1/2]). 71[1/2] -- Newton Abbot (D
Emery, S Bawden, 8[1/2]). 72[1/2] -- Braehead (A Goldie, A Harper,
11[1/2]), Coxmoor (D McJannet, R Overton, +[1/2]). 73[1/2] -- Youghal.
74[1/2] -- Bognor Regis, Bramhall. 75 -- Llanishen. 76[1/2] -- East
Renfrewshire. 77[1/2] -- Burnham Beeches. 78 -- Bolton Old Links,
Strandhill. 78[1/2] -- St Fillans. 79 -- Warren. 79[1/2] -- Killymoon,
Royston. 80 -- South Shields, Hinckley, Malton &amp; Norton. 81 -- Tunbridge
Wells. 83[1/2] -- Haggs Castle. 85 -- Sandiway. 89 -- Melrose.
* SCOTT Henderson warmed up for today's Assistants' Autumn Classic at
Kilspindie by shooting a six-under-par 63 in the pre-tournament pro-am
yesterday. Henderson carded eight birdies and an eagle to beat Garry
Jack by one stroke. Leading scores:
63 -- S Henderson (Kings Links). 64 -- G Jack (Kirriemuir). 65 -- J
Greaves (Glasgow), D Drysdale (Dunbar). 66 -- R Aitken (Kilmarnock
Barassie), C Everett (Caldwell), G Redford (Turnberry Hotel), J
McCreadie (Buchanan Castle), P Wardell (Longniddry). 67 -- N Scott-Smith
(Dullatur), A Tait (Cawder).
Team: 51 -- C Sinclair (Blairgowrie), A McDonald, J Cunningham, J
Toole.
* AN 80 over the Keir course at Cawder yesterday gave Lanark's Pat
Hutton top spot in the silver scratch section of the Lanarkshire Women's
Strokeplay Meeting. Leading scores:
Silver. Scratch: 80 -- Mrs P Hutton (Lanark). Handicap: 77 -- Mrs C
Maxton (Hamilton, 5). 78 -- Miss E McCormack (Cawder, 6) bih. Bronze.
Scratch: 100 -- Mrs M Dunn (Cathkin Braes). Handicap: 79 -- Mrs M Dunn
(Cathkin Braes, 21). 80 -- Mrs M McKenzie (Lenzie, 21).
* LIZ Cunningham, from the Elie and Earlsferry club, took top prize in
the Fife Women's Meeting at Crail yesterday. Cunningham notched 36
Stableford points to win by four from Florence Guttridge and Rhoda
Farrell. Leading points scores:
36 -- L Cunningham (Elie &amp; Earlsferry). 32 -- F Guttridge (St Rule),
bih; R Farrell (Canmore). 31 -- M Matheson (St Regulus).

Bovver boys may not be as bad as they are painted, discovers DAVID
BELCHER.
OI, who you looking at? Tune in to Channel 4's new youth-cult series,
Tribe Time, on Saturday night and you'll be looking at a great many
proletarian youths with brutally close-cropped hair. Many will be
wearing militaristic olive-green nylon flying-jackets, while all will be
sporting large boots, generally displayed with nonchalant ominousness
beneath trousers aggressively hoicked to half-mast.
You will, of course, be looking at skinheads, and as every liberal
reactionary knows, skinheads are all bovver-bootin', swastika-lovin',
sieg-heilin', stormtroopin' fascists, aren't they?
Well no, actually, as World of Skinhead, assembled by a trio of Anglos
resident in Scotland, makes clear in its warts'n'all depiction of
Britain's longest-lasting, most widespread cultural export.
Skinheads are upright blue-collar Chinese, Thai, and Puerto Rican
blokes living in New York. Skinheads are perky feather-cut Glasgow
girls, earnest Norwegians, and genteel Jewish couples in Berlin.
Less acceptable skinhead faces? Sure. There's pasty white-power-monger
Paul, a reasoned exponent of Blood and Honour's rock-focused brand of
racism. There's the group of beer-bellied, casually-racist, old-school
bully-boys from Tilbury in darkest Essex, standing around a pub pool
table, cues in hand, looking scarily like the assembled uncles of soccer
hard man Neil Ruddock. And there's Barry, a chirpy, Crombie-overcoated
youth from the English garden-suburb of Wycombe whose skin is gleaming
Afro-Caribbean black.
Dunoon-based George Marshall, author of Spirit of '69: A Skinhead
Bible and former publisher of the globally-distributed quarterly news
sheet Skinhead Times, provided the programme with its entree to the
wide, wide world of skins. Without him, no one was saying nothing, mush.
''Skinheads have been stitched up so many times before in the media,
out of laziness, ignorance, bigotry . . . it's easy to put the finger on
a group who are so visibly different,'' says Marshall. ''The National
Front do the same thing with people whose skin is a different colour.''
This point is taken up by Doug Aubrey and Alan Robertson, partners in
Dennistoun's top independent TV production company, Pictorial Heroes.
''Lots of old middle-class, university-educated hippies have lodged in
the mainstream media, and they evidently still fear and misunderstand
skinheads, persistently casting them as the bad guys who put the boot
into peace, love, and understanding,'' says Aubrey.
''At the same time, skinheads aren't apologising for anything. They
don't want acceptance as a cuddly, cosy bunch. Like all youth cults,
they want to be seen as dangerous, tough. Teddy Boys, Hell's Angels,
skinheads, punks. They all look hard, which is the first line of defence
for every youth cult.''
Cricket-loving Bedfordshire Corinthian Robertson concurs. ''I never
had an opinion on skinheads before we made the programme, but now I'd
defend them. They're not all racists. But they are all proud of what
they are. But I have to say that World of Skinhead is chiefly about
skinheads, not about racism or politics. The look has become corrupted
by association.''
OK. We know what skinheads aren't, so what are they, George?
''Every skinhead has a different explanation, but there's one
recurring word throughout the programme: pride. Being a skinhead means
taking a pride in yourself, in your class. In your town, maybe, or in
your country. Or for some people, in the extreme, pride in your race.
That's different to the media stereotype of the bonehead Nazi. Whenever
you see plays on the telly, skinheads are always groups of graveyard
glue-sniffers with ripped jeans and an IQ of 10. Not much to be proud of
there.''
Others view their skinhead pasts as a necessarily confused and
turbulent passage from boyhood to manhood. There is commendable insight
and honesty, too. ''We were horrible gits. We always used to complain
that people were picking on us. But when 20 of us walked into a pub . .
. and we were big blokes. It's hard to look nice and quiet as a
skinhead. You look nasty whether you are or not.''
The final word belongs to Perth polymath Stuart Cosgrove, the ex-skin
and current Channel 4 big-wig who commissioned Tribe Time.
''Being a skinhead is about living a life of grace under pressure,''
he tells me, busily removing an imperceptible speck of dust from the
sleeve of his Gucci replica-Harrington jacket.

THE largest network computing conference in the UK this year began
yesterday at the newly-opened Edinburgh International Conference Centre.
Some 600 delegates and 1000 exhibition visitors attended the first day
of the two-day LAN '95 showpiece.
Fifty of the leading names in the network computer industry, including
IBM, Novell, Lotus, Scottish Telecom and Shiva, were among those taking
part, offering the most up-to-date technological information.
Visitors had the opportunity to learn about the most recent
innovations in the field of computer networking.
One of the conference's leading speakers, Peter Black, customer
services director of Scottish Telecom, said Scottish firms could gain a
vital competitive edge if they embraced the changes taking place in
computing, information technology and telecommunications.
''For Scottish companies to compete against other businesses
nationally and internationally, it is important that they have access to
the most advanced technology available, as well as the technical
expertise to tailor the technology to provide solutions for their
particular operations,'' he said.
Mr Black added that the company's network development had already won
a prestige contract providing the Metropolitan Area Networks serving
academic institutions.
''These MANs carry computer data and traffic along the superhighway,
allowing students and staff at 13 universities including Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and St Andrews, as well as six higher
education colleges and teaching hospitals, to share their computer
capacity as if they were in the same room.
''Our work, in linking these universities and colleges, will also have
a major impact in strengthening the ties between Scottish education and
Scottish business.''

NOBODY should be surprised that Braveheart has substantially increased
support for the SNP, and while opponents may hope that this effect is
temporary I would caution them not to raise their hopes too much.
While Braveheart is Hollywood rather than pure fact it does highlight
the desire of Scots to risk everything, including their lives, in order
to obtain freedom.
Perhaps this makes today's Scots reflect on how little we have done in
our lifetime for our country, which still exports many of our most
talented and able to countries throughout the world, enriching their
economies rather than our own.
I have just recently returned from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia,
where there is a growing Scottish community, many operating new
businesses or managing some of the largest companies in that country.
They are attracted by the dramatic and sweeping changes since Estonia
gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.
Constrast Estonia's progress with that of Scotland. The Constitutional
Convention has existed longer than free Estonia. We still await a final
document of the convention's design for a toytown parliament.
In the same period the Estonians have removed the Russian army from
their streets, prepared and passed a full written constitution, held two
General Elections, written the entire legislation for 18 government
ministries, taken up their place in the United Nations, formalised their
application to join both the European Union and Nato, and opened up
rapidly growing trading links with the West.
They have already achieved the highest living standards of any of the
former Soviet republics. They have removed all previous Russian
subsidies, and unemployment is currently under 4%. Estonia's population
is less than a third of Scotland's yet no Estonian believes they are
''too small'' to be independent.
If Braveheart manages to instil some pride, self-belief, and
confidence into Scots then I will not care one whit that it was
Hollywood or a undersized Australian who brought it about. I will
content myself that at long last my nation begins to make the sort of
progress that it is capable of achieving.

IN the continual debate surrounding the much-heralded ''information
superhighway'' and the linking of people and businesses to information,
a new survey has added some doubt as to how soon these services will
become a reality.
The research, conducted by IT marketing company Banner &amp; Co, claims
that 48% of all medium-sized business in the UK -- that is those with
between 20 and 49 employees -- have still not networked their PCs. It
also suggests that there is a growing north/south divide in the number
of networked users, with just 4% of companies networked in Scotland
compared to 15% in London.
These figures come as some surprise considering that Scotland is
regarded as a leading centre for innovation and high-technology
industries.
Scottish companies also have a reputation for investing more in IT per
business than those in any other part of the UK.
Networks are continuing to evolve beyond their natural boundaries to
encompass the most remote outposts and branch offices, which until
recently were rarely catered for in the corporate plan.
Teleworkers and nomadic staff are demanding the same resources and
facilities as head office personnel. This has resulted in networking
penetrating markets and environments never before addressed by the
network vendor community.
Vertical markets, professional business practices and small to medium
enterprises present the networking fraternity with a market opportunity
far greater than any addressed to date.
Organisations such as Scottish Enterprise have identified the
importance to Scottish business growth of developing these
communications networks. The recently formed Information Highways Team
will be responsible for bringing these networks to firms throughout
Scotland.
Another company heavily involved in bringing businesses on this side
of the Border on-line is Scottish Telecom, which has already invested
around #40m in developing the most advanced fibre-optic communications
network of its kind in Europe. It is hoped this new network, which uses
state-of-the-art optical fibre transmission and switching technologies,
will enable businesses and academic institutions to gain a real edge
over their competitors.
Designed as a technology to make sharing and communicating information
easy, networking is notoriously difficult to understand. Despite more
than a decade of promises about ''open systems'', compatibility and
industry standards, it can be a minefield for would-be investors. But
companies need to network, share and manipulate data to survive in an
increasingly competitive market.
One which has recognised the difficulties facing Scottish businesses
in their quest to get on-line is Glasgow-based LAN Support Company
(LSC), a specialist network computing solutions provider. Formed in
April 1992 by directors Bruce Thomson, Kevin McGuire, Robert Campbell
and Stephen Campbell, it now employs more than 20 technical specialists
providing IT support and consultancy services to many Scottish
organisations.
One of the strategic business units within the LSC group is LAN Media,
an information technology marketing events company, set up with the
specific objective of bringing world-class, highly-focused IT events to
Scotland.

Ian Sutherland talks to author James Balmain, whose works of 'fiction'
are based on disturbing facts
MOST citizens of Argyll are unaware that, in recent months, there has
been among them an ultra-discreet eavesdropper. Novelist James Balmain's
recording of public-bar rumour mills will merge with research in
scientific journals, trade publications and public and academic
libraries.
In a few months, the result will be published as The Gaian -- a
disturbing semi-sci-fi thriller which predicts that imminent development
of offshore oilfields around the Western Isles and the West Atlantic
could lead to enormous climate changes in Britain and the rest of
Northern Europe -- along with ruthless eco-terrorism, state skulduggery,
the establishment of nuclear plants in Argyll and the creation of
rigidly controlled ''company terms'' run by privatised police and amoral
administrators.
Balmain's latest scenario offers little for anyone's comfort. Free
enterprise is damned as an opportunistic force leading to
twenty-first-century fascism. State intervention is revealed as a means
of control rather than a contribution to fairness. Dreams of Scottish
independence crumble into agonised acceptance of ''jobs versus
environment'' conundrums.
In 1993, James Balmain -- the pseudonym of a Scots writer who
obsessively guards his real identity -- published The Meek Inheritance,
probably the world's first Aids thriller. The Meek Inheritance is a
compendium of medical fact, epidemiology, sexual perversion and
political chicanery. It provoked distinctly peculiar reactions. Sections
of Britain's gay press praised the book. Among mainstream media, only
The Herald reviewed the novel's exposure of paedophilia in high places
and highlighted Balmain's uncanny accuracy in predicting the rate of
spread of HIV and Aids in Britain and throughout the world.
Soon after, the book vanished from most retail outlets. Students and
journalists have to track down library copies. But while conventional
bookshops rejected the book, the American film industry ferreted out
Balmain's whereabouts -- and The Meek Inheritance is now in the hands of
one of Hollywood's best-known sci-fi producers.
Balmain's latest plot picks up on rumours which have circulated for
many months on Scotland's west coast to the effect that oil companies
are intensifying exploitation of finds around the Western Isles and the
Western Approaches. According to such scuttlebutt, helicopter operators
have sized up Connell airfield, near Oban. Other whisperings tell of
surveyors measuring deep-water inlets suitable for bringing ashore
pipelines, or capable of supporting onshore processing and supply
facilities.
The recent rows about British Gas drilling near offshore munitions
dumps west of Galloway fuel the bush telegraph -- as does every
announced purchase of exploration blocks in the West Atlantic. Balmain
says West Highlanders' gossip is ''no longer a trickle but a torrent --
they wonder intensely about what's coming''.
Balmain's delvings into scientific journals suggest that what might be
coming is extraction of cadmium-rich oil. This substance -- said to be
vastly more profitable in terms of petro-chemicals, plastics and
pharmaceuticals than the ''light crude'' found in the North Sea --
exists in huge quantities in parts of the Gulf of Arabia. Cadmium-rich
oil is also a deadly pollutant.
Balmain says: ''For example, if a pint of light crude was poured into
a major water reservoir, most filter systems could cope. But if
terrorists introduced cadmium-rich oil into water supplies, the whole
reservoir would have to be drained. It's vastly more toxic than light
crude. An Exxon Valdez-scale spill off Scotland could devastate the area
for hundreds of years.
So, will The Gaian be a standard environmentalist tract? ''That would
be cheap propaganda. Oil companies are actually determined to be
environmentally conscious in every sense.'' But the road to hell,
according to Balmain is paved with good intentions.
''I'm just trying to make people -- in industry or wider society --
think about what they are doing.'' The Meek Inheritance has become a
minor cult among left-wing students. Battered copies pass from hand to
hand.
It remains to be seen if The Gaian disappears as per The Meek
Inheritance. Somehow Hollywood seems hungry for what the British book
trade shrugs off as fantasy and nonsense.
Balmain says: ''I stand by every word and fact in my Aids novel.
Spread-rate is exactly as I said. News about drugs slowing down the
onset of Aids is just displacement activity from a world that won't face
facts.
''I won't reveal my identity under any circumstances. If I did, my
sources would dry up instantly. I operate by gleaning from dozens of
unrelated people who have no idea who I am and what I am doing. I then
link the information gathered. The results can only be published as
fiction.
''I guarantee that everything I predict in The Gaian could happen too.
It's all based on fact.''

ONCE heard, never forgotten. The sound of the St Petersburg
Philharmonic is like a drug. Eventually last night, in the first concert
of their two-night residency in the concert hall, they provided, in
Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony, a massive fix (almost an overdose) for
addicts of their sound and style.
That we had to wait until the second half for a rush wasn't really
their fault. Over two nights they're playing the complete Tchaikovsky
symphonies. Which means, as well as numbers two and three, and the last
three masterpieces, they've got to play the First Symphony. Wisely, they
got it out of the way first.
There are some lovely moments in the work, and all the quintessential
elements of the old lush's mature style -- the rush of blood, the aching
throb. But they're not yet organised into coherence, nor -- more
importantly -- impelled by the anxiety complex that stamps the later
music. So if conductor Yuri Temirkanov and the St Petersburg Phil seemed
a bit subdued, that was perhaps why.
The second half, and the Fourth Symphony, was value for money; every
bar, every note. In a majestic, surging, and incredibly flexible
account, Temirkanov not only unleashed the great Russian orchestra but
got his own act together: clockwork wrist clicking, head cocked, hand on
hip, pelvis a-swivelling, off he went.
The playing was out of this world: rich strings, silky up top, booming
through the floor in the bass; gorgeous woodwind and horns; throaty
brass. And a wonderful interpretation with a dazzling pizzicato third
movement and a finale characterised with stupendous articulation by the
orchestra in full flight. Incandescent. More tonight. Lashings of it.

Theatre
PERHAPS the playing skill has been lost, perhaps they need the radical
reinterpretation of Daldry and MacNeil's touring An Inspector Calls, but
period pieces like Patrick Hamilton's Gaslight clearly present problems
for modern actors, if less so for modern audiences.
There is little to fault in Keith Baxter's direction of this show, and
almost nothing in Simon Higlett's large box set. Brimming over with
domestic realism, it is neatly counterpointed in the opening scenes
where references to theatricality and role-playing not only provide the
twists of the dialogue but illuminate the continuing fascination with
theatre in life -- from the O J Simpson trial to the local case of the
reinvented Bearsden schoolboy.
If only that facility of the text was translated into the
performances. Part of the problem here undoubtedly lies in the casting.
Either Jane How is too old to play Bella Manningham (and her performance
is curiously flat and lacking in passion) or Tristan Gemmill too young
to be her husband, the villainous Jack. His bullying is too much of the
barrack-room or boys' dorm and not enough of the more subtle interchange
between the sexes.
Frank Finlay, as the calling Inspector Rough, oozes charm and
charisma, and is hugely effective in the first act as he teases the plot
from the main characters -- and the set. But just as Flora Montgomery,
as the maid-with-her eyes-on-the-master, Nancy, is a believable tease
but a less credible second act sexpot, Finlay is better at the
playfulness than he is at the denouement. Perhaps the swings and
roundabouts of melodrama are now best seen in TV soaps.

Despite a steep increase in civil lawsuits against doctors, Alan
MacDermid, Medical Correspondent, explains why it is so difficult for
patients to win their cases
IF YOU can never find a policeman when you need one these days one of
the reasons is likely to be that he is sitting somewhere in a courtroom
waiting to give evidence.
There is now a growing danger that the same thing could happen to
doctors as their roles multiply, not only as witness but judge and jury
over each other.
''Whistle-blowing'' on their colleagues, sitting on the disciplinary
committees that have been spawned by the splitting of the NHS into
trusts, and participating in the new expanded role of the General
Medical Council are among the new jobs that have prompted Dr Sandra
Campbell to ask: ''Who's going to look after the patients?''
Dr Campbell, senior medical adviser to the Medical and Dental Defence
Union of Scotland (MDDUS) has seen a steep increase since the the 1980s
of civil lawsuits against doctors.
People becoming more aware of their rights, the availability of Legal
Aid, access to their medical notes, publicity in the popular press and
magazines, and advice from organisations like Citizens Advice Bureaux,
have all contributed to this litigiousness. So too has the pro-active
role of the legal profession -- the so-called ''ambulance chasers'' --
in drumming up business.
According to Dr Campbell it's not that her colleagues are making more
horrendous mistakes than ever before.
''There have always been medical accidents and always will be, but I
don't think doctors are getting more negligent,'' she said yesterday.
''What we are seeing is a change of emphasis. There are still claims for
technical errors but more and more complaints centre round the consent
issue -- not being told the side effects of a drug, or a patient having
an ovary removed or a hysterectomy without being asked.''
The MDDUS is one of the three principal defence organisations which
indemnify doctors against legal action.
Only 1 or 2% per cent of cases go the whole way to court. Most fizzle
out some way along the line, with 16%-18% settled out of court.
''If someone has damaged a patient we tend to settle,'' said Dr
Campbell. ''If there is negligence and we fight it all the way the
lawyers are the only ones who will benefit.''
Defence unions are also obliged to inform the Department of Social
Security's Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU), who are responsible for
clawing back from any award the invalidity benefits that have been paid
to an injured patient.
''It is not something the public always realise, but unless people
have a really large claim they will tend to settle below #2500, the
threshold beyond which the CRU seeks recovery.''
Complaints by one doctor against another -- the ''whistle-blowing''
role which may become a requirement of doctors' contracts and is already
a GMC requirement -- may lead to a conflict of interests if both doctors
are members.
''In those cases we open two files and have each assigned to a
different officer of the union.
''The GMC already takes a firm line on this -- a clinical manager who
fails to act on advice about a doctor's shortcomings will find himself
before the disciplinary committee along with him.''
When the NHS took over liability for doctors it employed directly --
as opposed to GPs, who are self-employed contractors -- the medical
defence organisations were asked to contribute to the cost.
This has provided a ''pot'' out of which pay-outs by health boards or
trusts could be met.
It says something for the standard of medical care in Scotland and/or
the stinginess of court settlements that while the ''pot'' in England
and Wales is now empty, the scheme here is still running on interest
with the capital intact.
It also indicates that it is not easy for a patient or relative to sue
a doctor successfully. John and May McGalliard, for example, face a
number of obstacles if they are to successfully sue Stobhill Hospital
over the death of their 14-year-old daughter Lorraine.
Last week the General Medical Council cleared the senior doctor in the
case, Mr John Dalling, but expressed concern about a range of
contributory factors.
The three main hurdles to cross are to establish duty of care, cause
and failure of care.
It is the last of these -- in effect, negligence -- that is likely to
be the most difficult. There are, for one thing, limits as to the
information that the defence has to disclose pre-trial.
''We are getting better at disclosing things at an early stage -- we
know that if the claim is spurious an experienced legal firm will
recognise that the case isn't going to stand up -- and we have to lodge
our broad defence, but only insofar as the pursuers raise a particular
point,'' said Dr Campbell.
''But although we have to say what the defence is, we don't have to
disclose the expert's report that we have to back it up. This can leave
the pursuers in the dark as to what kind of experts they should be
citing. Their Legal Aid may only be enough for one expert witness, and
they might pick the wrong specialist.
''This puts them at a disadvantage, and there is a view that the law
should be changed to make it fairer; in the meantime, we have to act
according to the law -- our client is entitled to the best defence we
can give him.''
Patients who sue their doctor are liable to come up against the
defence that he or she acted as one of their peers would have done --
and one is normally enough. It is widely know as the Bolam principle but
the touchstone in Scotland is Hunter v Hanley, a 1950s case in which a
Glasgow lady sued her GP when the hypodermic needle he was using to give
her penicillin broke, leaving part of it lodged in her bottom, unable to
be found.
''The pursuer has to show that there is a recognised course of action
which any ordinary practitioner would have taken and that the defender
has deviated from it,'' explained Dr Campbell. The judge, Lord Clyde,
found for the doctor.
''The GP cited by the defence doesn't have to be the best GP in
Glasgow, just as a senior house officer will be judged by the standards
of a senior house officer, not a consultant neurosurgeon.
''That is why it is so tough for a Scot to win a negligence action.''

Rangers 2, Motherwell 1
THEIR fifth premier-division win of the season was welcomed with a
sigh of relief by Rangers' supporters who made up the great bulk of the
37,348 supporters inside Ibrox last night because they realised the
triumph was not gained without cause.
Two of the club's most influential players were injured, and are now
doubtful for the next Champions' League match, which is against Juventus
in Turin in two weeks' time.
Both Rangers' scorers, Paul Gascoigne, who set Rangers on the road to
victory with an early strike, and Ally McCoist, were taken off during a
scrappy second half, and both players were in considerable discomfort.
Gascoigne appeared to injure his left thigh and McCoist damaged his
groin. Although they will be examined again this morning, the early
signs were not good.
Rangers' manager Walter Smith was resigned last night to losing both
of them for the match in Turin, and the managers of Scotland and
England, Craig Brown and Terry Venables, also will have to do without
the players for next week's internationals in Sweden and Norway.
Before last night, Rangers knew they would be without Brian Laudrup,
who sees a specialist, for three more weeks, and Smith can only hope for
rapid recoveries. He may be able to compensate for the loss of such
important players for the games against Aberdeen and Partick Thistle
over the next couple of weeks, but Juventus in the Stadium Delle Alpi is
an altogether different proposition.
Smith would have to deploy all of his best players to have any chance
of taking even a point in Italy. Without Laudrup, Gascoigne, and
McCoist, he will know the chances of surviving the tie with the team's
credibility are greatly reduced.
''It is early to say for sure yet, but the club doctor thinks they
will be out for a couple of weeks,'' said Smith, who was also
disappointed in the manner in which his side lost their early advantage
which was gained when Gascoigne scored after only 11 minutes.
He also felt Rangers should have had a penalty in the second half when
Gordon Durie went down inside Motherwell's box as Chris McCart
challenged him. However, the truth is Rangers made the night more
difficult than it ought to have been after the way they had dominated
the first half with Gascoigne running the show.
He surged into Motherwell's box anticipating Alexei Mikhailichenko's
pass, and even though the ball took a deflection off a Motherwell
defender, the Englishman kept calm and scored with a nonchalant flick of
his left foot.
Rangers then went on to dominate the remainder of the half, but Smith
pointed out later: ''We did not make as many chances as I would have
liked, given the possession we had.''
Motherwell, who must have known they were fortunate still to be in
touch when they returned after the break, equalised in 51 minutes when
Shaun McSkimming scored with a looping header from Paul Lambert's free
kick, but Craig Moore was negligent.
The defender seemed completely unaware of the danger as McSkimming
attacked. It was just after this goal when Gascoigne went down and he
had to be helped off the pitch, leaving his place to Stuart McCall. A
little later Ian Durrant took over from Mikhailichenko and the
newcomer's first touch set up the winner.
His delivery into Motherwell's box in 69 minutes brought the best out
of McCoist, who rose and headed into Scott Howie's net. McCoist then
hobbled off five minutes later, and Neil Murray was sent into midfield
and Durrant pushed up front to partner Durie.
Motherwell's scorer McSkimming also went off injured after a tackle by
Moore, who was booked. The Fir Park club's player left on a stretcher
suffering from a twisted knee, and his place was taken by Andy Roddie
and although Motherwell also used all of their substitutes they were
unable to avoid their first premier-division defeat of the season.
''Shaun's injury is not as bad as we first feared,'' said Motherwell's
manager Alex McLeish. ''However, I'm disappointed we didn't take
something from the game.
''At times, Rangers played the ball well but they weren't really going
anywhere. Gascoigne ran things in the first half, but we closed down
much better in the second and I've told my players to keep their heads
up.''
Moore was one of seven players booked -- Richard Gough and Alex
Cleland, of Rangers, and Motherwell's McCart, Jamie Dolan, Tommy Coyne,
and McSkimming all were shown yellow cards -- but the match couldn't be
described as having been dirty.
It was scrappy and untidy more than anything and towards the end it
had become too frenetic. In fact it was in stark contrast to the way
Rangers had gone about their business in the first half when they seemed
able to pass the ball without serious interference from any of
Motherwell's players.
It is Smith's intention to make his players aware that they must do
more to harm their opponents when they are so much in command.
It will not be much consolation to Gascoigne, of course, but as he
made the net bulge last night, so also did his bank balance. His new
boot deal guarantees him a payment -- it has been said he receives
between 2000 and 10,000 every time he scores -- with each strike. If he
recovers in time to play against Juventus and scores it would be a goal
worth perhaps as much as a million pounds to his club.
RANGERS -- Goram, Moore, Cleland, Gough, McLaren, Petric, Durie,
Gascoigne, McCoist, Ferguson, Mikhailichenko. Substitutes -- Durrant,
McCall, Murray.
MOTHERWELL -- Howie, May, McKinnon, Philliben, Martin, McCart,
Lambert, Dolan, Coyne, Arnott, McSkimming. Substitutes -- Davies,
Roddie, Burns.
Referee -- J McGilvray (Edinburgh).

THE resurgence of Aberdeen, one of the more welcome aspects of the new
season, will be tested to the full before the week is out with games
against Hearts and Rangers. First, Roy Aitken's side has to make the
trip to Edinburgh, where the Tynecastle team is in good humour after
John Robertson's last-minute rescue act against their old rivals,
Hibernian, on Sunday.
One player looking forward to both contests is Stephen Glass, who
candidly confesses that he got his chance to show his worth in the top
side only because the team was not doing well. ''If they had been
playing well I would have had to wait a few years,'' he said. ''Now the
manager has kept faith with me and it is really enjoyable the way the
team is playing.''
Aitken will probably name an unchanged team, which would mean that new
#1m signing Paul Bernard must wait for his chance -- and that would also
mean no return for Brian Grant, who is fit again after having broken an
arm in the pre-season. Demoted keeper Theo Snelders will also remain on
the bench.
Hearts will check their latest injury victim, Gary Locke, in the
morning, but the fear is that he has a cartilage problem. He will surely
join the list of sidelined contenders -- Craig Levein, Kevin Thomas, and
Fraser Wishart -- along with doubtful Alan Johnson and suspended Gary
Mackay. Scott Leitch, however, is available again after suspension.
Hibs, who feel they tossed away a victory over their oldest rivals at
the weekend, hope to continue their excellent away form when they meet
Raith Rovers at Stark's Park. So far they have won two and drawn one of
their three league matches outside Edinburgh, a contrast from their away
track record last season. They have doubts about Andy Millen, who was
taken off injured on Sunday, and Kevin McAllister, but Kevin Harper is
available again after suspension.
Rovers' striker Colin Cameron, who was thrilled to be named in the
Scotland ''B'' squad for Sweden, is working hard to be fit to play
tonight after having suffered a groin injury.
The Fifers are desperate to recover winning form to boost their morale
for the big UEFA Cup challenge against Bayern Munich, who are certain to
be taking the opportunity to have a look at the Fifers.

WHILE the Scottish organisers of next year's World Rowing
Championships spent the summer dipping into their own pockets to pay for
essential fact-finding missions in Europe, it has now emerged that
England's Amateur Rowing Association has failed to hand over #50,000 of
Sports Council grant aid paid directly to them as the recognised
governing body, but expressly intended for next year's Scottish
organisers.
Strathclyde Park will host the 1996 World Rowing Championships and 20
members of the Scottish committee travelled to Poland in August to learn
from this year's junior championships, while another party later
travelled to Finland for this year's World Championships. With funding
applied for but apparently not yet available, the members of these
parties paid for their own trips, which for Poland came to over #500.
However, the Sports Council in London this week confirmed that they
had agreed in May to give the 1996 event a total of #100,000 in stages,
and that the first #25,000 instalment had been paid directly to the ARA
in early August. Yesterday, Peter Morrison, chairman of the Scottish
event's organising committee confirmed that the first instalment had
only just been received, some seven weeks after the Sports Council had
paid it out, but was astounded to learn that the second #25,000
instalment had also been paid to the ARA at the beginning of last month.
At the ARA's request, Morrison had travelled to London on Saturday to
report to the ARA's agm, but, despite detailed discussions about the
championships finances, had not been told that the second much-needed
payment was sitting in the ARA's account. ''I had absolutely no idea
about this,'' Morrison said.
Yesterday, an ARA spokeswoman said that ''they were not aware of any
financial problem'' caused this summer. She was, however, unable to
indicate when the second instalment would be handed over.
The World Championships will attract almost 2000 competitors from up
to 60 nations and, while it is being organised in Scotland, it is
formally the property of the ARA. Morrison originally sought a Sports
Council grant in July 1994 but had his efforts superceded by the ARA.
Following this, it took more than six months for the ARA to put forward
their application.
As well as the championships grant, the ARA are also seeking funding
for Britain's Olympic team through the Sports Council.
These revelations are the latest in a long line of problems between
the ARA in England and Scottish rowing officials.

LAST night's England international rugby squad training session at
Marlow was held in private. That was an attempt to foil the evil hordes
of media persons who might want to ask embarrassing questions of one,
William David Charles Carling.
When he played for Harlequins on Saturday the same Mr Carling had to
be protected -- at whose expense, one might inquire -- by a ring of
police constables. They will be helicoptering him in and out if this
goes on.
Let me make this clear -- I have no wish to pronounce in moral
judgment of Will Carling. Whatever he did or did not get up to in the
set-pieces with Princess Di is between him, her, his wife, and their
lawyers. We have all done things in our life we would not like to be
publicised.
I do think, however, he should be replaced as England's captain.
Supporters will tell you that Carling has been one of the most
successful England captains of all time. The record book shows that,
under him, the team has won three Grand Slams and the same number of
Five Nations' Championships.
But the question which should be asked is: would they have done better
being led by anyone else? If Rob Andrew or Dean Richards or even, dare I
say it, Brian Moore had been carrying the ball, would there not have
been greater success? I believe the answer has to be in the affirmative.
Carling has had a fine team built around him and most of the time the
mixture has worked well. None the less, in the real crunch situations,
they have not lived up to their potential. England could have won the
1991 World Cup. They told everyone they were going to win this year's
event. In fact, they did neither and this time they went out a round
early.
When the tactics were obviously not working, Carling was at a loss
what to do. When Andrew kicked away good possession after the team's
pronounced aim was to spread the ball, did Will ever have a word?
Did he, as he most surely should have done, tell Moore to button his
lip? That is what real leaders would have done.
I've seen England beaten by inferior teams -- like Ireland, twice --
while Carling held on-the-park committee meetings trying to decide what
option to take. He was equally indecisive when Scotland clinched the
1990 Grand Slam.
The British Lions selectors did not appoint him captain for the tour
to New Zealand in 1992 for the simple reason they required someone to
inspire the side. Carling could not have done that, Gavin Hastings did.
Indeed, I thought Will was extremely fortunate to remain as England
skipper for the World Cup after his infamous ''57 old farts'' blast at
the English committee. Yes, no doubt some thought the remarks funny, or
even true, but what sort of judgment did they display? If any other
employee had said that about his bosses, the P45 would have been in the
post. Then, the other England players stood loyally by him. After the
South African experience I would be surprised if they still feel the
same way.
I watched Carling at the press conference after England had beaten
Scotland for the Grand Slam last season. You would have expected an
enthusiastic, excited figure to emerge from the dressing room.
Not so. Will sat, his head on his chest, and gave his version of the
''yes, no'' interlude. What were the highlights of the game for him?
''Nothing, really.''
There was a reason for this reticence. Carling was signed up to do a
column for an English tabloid Sunday newspaper in which, surprise,
surprise, he was much more forthcoming.
I cannot imagine Gavin Hastings behaving in such a manner; nor would
any good international captain.
Now it is said the tabloid press is wrecking Carling's life. Those who
live by the sword . . .
Will is a fine player, probably worthy of more caps. But he cannot be
kept in hiding forever. Carling has been captain for six seasons, a
longer reign that most. He should be told his skipper's role has ended
and a new era begun.
Who should take over? I think the time of the Moores, the Andrews, and
the Richards is coming swiftly to its conclusion. Let the responsibility
pass to Mike Catt or Martin Johnson, someone who will definitely be
around for the next World Cup. By that time, I am prepared to wager,
Will Carling will be a member of the media pack he currently so
despises.

GRAEME Obree, who last week claimed the world 4000 metres pursuit
championship, will have to scale even greater heights of physical and
mental endurance when he faces Spanish superstar Miguel Indurain and
other top riders in the individual time trial at Puipa, 120 miles east
of Bogota in Colombia.
The 30-year-old Scot knows Indurain will be hungry to clinch his first
world title in the opening leg of a double he hopes to complete in
Sunday's world road race championship.
Despite his dominance of the Tour de France, the closest Indurain has
gone to winning a world title was two years ago in Norway, when
runner-up in the road race behind American Lance Armstrong.
This time he is one of several serious contenders in both events,
which are wide open because of the high altitude of the courses, around
2600 metres above sea level.
Indurain expects victory to go to whoever can adapt best to the
altitude. He said: ''Tactics will be the least important aspect here.
There are no favourites in these competitions. Everyone is an unknown
quantity.''
Obree's Scottish team-mate, Sarah Phillips from Stonehaven, and the
Isle of Man's Marie Purvis will carry Britain's hopes in a
88.5-kilometre road race at Duitama on Saturday.

AS WELL as sorting his squad for their trip to Falkirk tonight, Tommy
Burns, the Celtic manager, was pondering the probable departure of one
player, Tony Mowbray and the likely arrival of another, Jackie McNamara.
A deal could be resolved quickly to take Mowbray to Ipswich Town but it
may take a little longer to settle the arrangement which would bring
McNamara, son of a former Celtic player with the same Christian name, to
Parkhead.
Burns confirmed yesterday that Ipswich have made a bid, understood to
be in the #300,000 region, and added: ''We will think about it for the
next couple of days but I don't think there will be any problems.''
Mowbray, signed by Liam Brady for #1m from Middlesbrough in November,
1991, has not been a first-team contender this season since Burns
brought John Hughes from Falkirk.
Celtic, according to Burns, not only met Dunfermline's original
valuation of McNamara, who has been doing well with the Scotland
Under-21 side, but raised their bid above it. ''It seems that the
transfer of Stephen McAnespie from Raith Rovers changed things, and the
price has gone up,'' said Burns. ''I am hopeful, however, that we can
get common ground.''
McAnespie joined Bolton last week for a fee of #900,000. The
Dunfermline manager, Bert Paton, said that Celtic had lifted their offer
and negotiations were continuing.
There was no news on the John Collins story, which has been this
year's longest running football soap opera so far, and he is in the
squad for Brockville. It will be a particularly important occasion for
Hughes, who had been such a Falkirk favourite before he was swept off to
Parkhead.
Phil O'Donnell is out because of a recurrence of a groin injury and
there is a doubt about Tosh McKinlay. Burns adds Chris Hay, who did well
when called into the midfield at Tynecastle, Malcolm Mackay and
19-year-old Jamie McQuilken, a young full back who has been impressive
for the reserves. If McKinlay fails to make it, McQuilken will get his
chance.
''Obviously we are all disappointed at losing to Rangers,'' said
Burns, ''but it is early season yet and we had been playing well and
scoring goals, except when we meet Rangers. Maybe we will try different
tactics the next time we meet. What is important is that we put it
behind us and remember that you get the same three points for beating
Falkirk as you do Rangers.''
Falkirk manager John Lambie has been unable to arrange a temporary
transfer of an experienced keeper in time for the kick-off. The
hamstring injury sustained by Tony Parks during the draw with Partick
Thistle at Firhill on Saturday left only reserve keeper Neil Inglis
available. Otherwise, Falkirk have no serious injury worries and are
likely to be unchanged, except in goal.
Partick Thistle did not too badly in collecting a point, considering
the staff is stretched to the limit because of injuries. Their team to
meet Kilmarnock at Firhill will almost certainly be unchanged and they
have made a much happier start to the season than Killie, who are
looking for their first point.
Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten knows that this could be a crucial
evening for his men. ''It's time for the players, and myself, to get it
right. There is no more time for talking. We have to turn things around,
starting against Thistle. I know how the pressure builds up.''
John Henry returns after injury.

ALBION Automotive, the resurgent Glasgow-based vehicle parts
manufacturer, has acquired a Volvo bus components plant at Leyland in
Lancashire.
The Farington Components plant employs 400 people, has annual sales of
around #18m and is currently running at a profit.
As part of the purchase arrangement, Albion has signed contracts to
continue supplying Volvo with parts from the factory for the next five
years.
This will provide a secure base for expanding the business in a way
that Volvo was unable to do. Albion, as an independent manufacturer,
plans to find new customers for Farington's products outwith the Volvo
group.
Financial details of the sale were not disclosed, but the deal does
not involve any hefty up-front payments by Albion, which was rescued
from receivership only two years ago.
''There is a small cash payment, but it is over a period of time and
related to the contracts we have with Volvo,'' said Albion marketing
manager Elaine Catton.
The deal boosts Albion Automotive's annual turnover to #70m and its
total workforce to 1160.
Volvo said its sale of Farington Components did not imply any threat
to its bus and truck factory at Irvine, the Swedish company's only other
manufacturing plant in the UK.
A spokesman for Volvo's truck and bus division noted that the company
had invested a further #6m in Irvine this year to boost production from
5500 vehicles a year to 8500.
Albion Automotive currently makes truck axles at Scotstoun in Glasgow
and chassis components at Leyland, less than a mile from its new
Farington plant.
All three factories formed part of the Leyland DAF group before its
collapse in February 1993.
Farington was sold to Volvo in 1988, but the two Albion Automotive
factories remained part of the Leyland DAF until the bitter end.
Albion Automotive was created in November 1993 through an innovative
deal put together by receiver Arthur Andersen.
Arthur Andersen brought in a new management team led by chief
executive Dan Wright and persuaded creditors to take equity holdings in
Albion Automotive to help restore the two factories to financial health.
The new company exceeded all expectations by breaking into profit in
March this year -- two years ahead of schedule.
So spectacular was its success that in July its creditors sold their
equity stake to venture capital firm Candover Investments and the
company announced a #20m investment programme.
This could be boosted to #37m as Albion Automotive reinvests profits
from its rapidly expanding operations over the next five years.
Commenting on yesterday's acquisition, Mr Wright said: ''What we have
done in Glasgow and at the Leyland components plant we can do again at
Farington.
''We have made this commitment because we believe we can turn the
operation into a successful, profitable and competitive part of the
international components business.''
Mr Wright added that he did not forsee any redundancies at Farington,
whose workforce only learned about the change of ownership yesterday,
but he refused to give any job guarantees.
The plant will concentrate on manufacturing transmission products,
such as gears, gearboxes and flanges, and engine components such as oil
and water pumps.
The key to success will be expanding sales by diversifying away from
dependence on one customer in the same way that Albion Automotive's
other two factories already have done.
At the time of Leyland DAF's collapse, Albion Automotive supplied
parts to four other factories, all of which were part of the same group.
Today it has 13 customers and although 90% of sales still go to former
Leyland DAF subsidiaries, the company is rapidly expanding business with
completely new buyers such as Perkins, JCB, and Artix.
Volvo had difficulty finding external sales outlets for Farington
because Volvo was a large vehicle manufacturer in its own right and
competitors were unwilling to buy parts from it, but 20% of the
factory's current production already goes to non-Volvo clients such as
Rolls Royce.
Mr Wright said that because of the Volvo name, it had an excellent
reputation for quality, but while it was under Volvo control, other
vehicle builders such as Ford had been unwilling to buy from it.
''The perception of ownership is what matters,'' he said.
The plant will be run through a holding company called Albion Auto
Industries and its management will remain separate from that of the
nearby chassis components factory.
But Ms Catton said the two plants would complement each other and
there was plenty of scope for synergy.
The Leyland factory, for instance, would have access to Farington's
gear cutting machinery, she noted.
The acquisition of Farington should also help drum up more business
for Albion Automotive as a whole, since the group will be able to offer
a wider range of products to vehicle builders.
''It puts us in a better position to get further business from other
people we are already talking to,'' Ms Catton said.

MANCHESTER United is in some danger of being regarded as a
merchandiser rather than a football club on current indications.
That applies both to players as well as kits with its having bought
Andy Cole for #6.25m but then offset that cost by selling Paul Ince for
a stated #6m to Inter Milan while controversially off-loading Ukrainian
star Kanchelskis for a net #4.4m after a #1.2m payment to his former
club, Donetz.
Chief executive Martin Edwards went out of his way to say that while
the Old Trafford club now has #12m to spend on players, manager Alex
Ferguson will have to justify it -- a point backed up by chairman and
old war horse, Sir Roland Smith.
The level of retailing is underlined by sales in the year to July
rising 38% to #60.6m but merchandising soared 65% to #23.5m. That is #5m
ahead of gate and programme receipts and while attendances were
depressed due to the rebuildng of the North Stand as part of a #34m
programme, Mr Edwards almost teetered on the edge of embarrassment at
the size of the improvement.
Happily that moment soon passed. He justified the need to change kits
for children, and also the overgrown sort who buy extra large jerseys,
as being a part of a two-year cycle.
Anyway, that was intensifed by changing from Adidas to Umbro and so
everything had to be replaced at once. He pointed out that even in 1890,
replica kits were being sold.
Transfer fees altogether brought in a net #3.73m before the
Kanchelskis deal which took place after the financial year end.
French star Eric Cantona, who was bought for #1m, still has another
three years of his contract to run -- and what happens after that will
depend very much on the European court judgment which has in an initial
ruling said that transfer fees should be made illegal.
Mr Edwards said that confirmation would have two results. One would be
that wages for top league players throughout Europe would rise, the
other that that smaller clubs would be hard hit. Many depend on transfer
fees to keep alive and the inability to sell on promising players would
dissuade them from maintaining youth teams which are the seedcorn of the
future.
The Umbro deal is due for renegotiation in 1998 but a new deal could
take earlier. Liverpool, a smaller side than ManUtd, is taking #23m from
Reebok over five years to sell replica kits and so Mr Edwards is highly
positive on that score -- as he is on Sky.
Income from there is currently worth #2.5m a year to the club and he
is ootimistic that all Premiership matches could be shown on the many
channels now available to BskyB at an enhanced subscription.
He is not fazed by the thought that could drive spectators away from
Old Trafford where ordinary stand ticket prices have been raised 13% to
#18 -- the most expensive in Britain. But he seemed a little concerned
that the expansion of capacity to 55,000 seats may take some filling.
That would very much depend on cup success both in England and in
Europe.
Short-term profitability will be hit be the stand rebuilding
programme. But the vast majority of the 12,000 shareholders are not
interested too much in the fact that profits last year rose 85% to #20m
and the dividend total advanced 7% to 4.5p. There are more important
things than these.
The shares of the football club, which is demonstrably the most open
about its financial affairs, closed 7p easier at 204p.

EAGLESCAIRNIE Mains Farm, near Haddington in East Lothian, has won
second place in the 1995 Booker Countryside Silver Lapwing Award
organised by the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group.
Mike Williams, who farms the 400-acre holding, will receive prize
money of #500 which he will spend on enhancing his present hedgerow
management plan.
Peter Johnson, chief executive of Booker Countryside, said the judges
found the policy at Eaglescairnie Mains was producing impressive arable
and timber crops, while enhancing and managing the woodlands and field
margins on a scale which greatly benefited wildlife on the farm.
Flexible setaside has been carefully distributed throughout the farm
by the use of various wild bird cover mixes, a substantial wildflower
meadow and some natural regeneration. Two-metre grass field margins have
been effectively and extensively used.
The first prizewinner this year was Givendale Farm, Great Givendale,
near Pocklington, York.
* THE Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group has welcomed the latest
setaside decision from Brussels which, it says, will benefit wildlife
enormously.
The decision to allow farmers to establish areas of permanent setaside
without incurring a 3% area penalty means they will now be able to
protect unfarmed habitats by providing buffer zones and linking areas of
established habitat with wildlife corridors of setaside land.

THE present low prices for salmon could eventually lead to real
difficulties for producers, Scottish Office Fisheries Minister Raymond
Robertson warned yesterday. If necessary the Government would move to
stop Norway dumping its surpluses on the UK market, he said.
Part of the problem, the Minister conceded, was over production by the
Norwegian salmon farming industry. He cautioned against adopting too
aggressive a stance against the Norwegians. However, he added:
''Frankly, when one looks at the extent of the further surge in their
production over the past year such a stance is not without
justification.
''I feel that the Scottish salmon industry should continue to
co-operate with its Norwegian counterparts -- and the Irish and Faroese
-- who are also important suppliers to the European market.''
Speaking at the Scottish Fish Farming Conference at Aviemore the
Minister said that for the longer term the concept of a European network
of producer organisations, which the Scottish Salmon Growers'
Association had been promoting, should not be dismissed out of hand.
Mr Robertson said the Government was watching price levels for salmon.
If it became apparent that action was required it would be prepared to
step in. The imposition of a minimum import price could, however, only
be a short-term measure. The longer-term answer was to get the balance
of supply and demand right -- and the industry believed that could be
done through producer organisations.
The Minister promised to use a visit to Norway next month as an
opportunity to pursue matters with his counterpart there. Despite
current difficulties, with salmon down to about #1.30 a pound, the
industry was healthy, he insisted.
''I have no desire to talk down the market or spread gloom and
despondency -- indeed I would caution all against such an approach or
attitude,'' he said. Salmon farming was worth #220m a year at first-sale
value and supported 2000 front-line jobs and about 5000 in ancillary
activities, he pointed out.
While emphasising the importance of marketing and promotion, he
indicated that the Government was unlikely to give cash support for
increased effort in that area. More value-added products must be devised
and then promoted by well established sectors such as salmon and trout,
he suggested.
Much of the input from the Government for the aquaculture industry, he
said, came through the local enterprise network. Highlands and Islands
Enterprise had invested #35m in the industry over many years. In
addition, the Government had allocated more than #5m up to 1999 to
assist fish farming in Scotland. That, in turn, was expected to generate
a further #15m worth of investment.
William Crowe, chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Growers'
Association, told the conference that under the Common Fisheries Policy
producer organisations were the device by which fishing effort or
production could be controlled.
The Norwegian government had announced plans for providing a
''mirror'' organisation in Norway following its decision not to join the
European Union.
''It has recognised the dangers of an industry which increases its
production by 45% when the market is growing at just over 20%,'' he
said.
''The Scottish PO working group has decided to be minimalist in its
approach and to avoid interfering in its members' affairs apart from
limiting smolt replacement when the conditions are right.
''We have tried to avoid the pitfalls of other regimes such as milk,
and artificial markets. Provision has been made for smolt producers, new
entrants, contracting and transferability.''

CONCERN over so-called fat cats in the boardroom has resurfaced
recently. The latest furore over executive pay and perks has been
sparked by the lucrative financial packages the board of the National
Grid will enjoy once the company is floated later this year.
At a time when the Government is encouraging public sector workers
such as doctors and nurses to accept modest pay deals, the actions of a
small minority of the corporate sector are rightly causing concern, and
not just among traditional opponents such as the unions and some
sections of the Labour Party.
The boardroom excesses of the privatised utilities are extreme and
isolated cases, but they serve to highlight the fact that in recent
years the gap between rich and poor has widened.
Anecdotal evidence has been supported by recent statistics. While it
usually pays to treat statistics with a healthy amount of scepticism, a
growing pile of data suggests that the rich are indeed getting richer at
the expense of the less well off.
Official figures published last week by the Central Statistical Office
(CSO) show that the highest paid employees have enjoyed much larger pay
increases than those at the foot of the ladder. The bottom 10% of
workers saw their pay increase by just 1.1% in the last year, while the
top 10% saw earnings rise by 3.4%.
The trend is even more marked over the last 10 years. During the
period the poorest paid 10% of employees saw their pay increase by 15%
in real terms, barely half of the 28% rise seen by the wealthiest tenth.
The differential between white and blue collar workers has grown
steadily over the years. The CSO said that the average gross weekly
earnings of all full-time employees in Britain in April 1995 were #336,
with manual workers averaging #272 compared with #372 for non-manual
workers.
At the top of the CSO's earnings league table came company treasurers
and financial managers, who pushed doctors into second place, surely a
poor indictment of our society's values but not an unexpected finding.
The poorest paid according to the CSO were petrol pump attendants and
kitchen staff.
While the UK is not alone in seeing a growing gap between rich and
poor, the rate of growth in the UK appears to have been faster than that
in other countries. Although inequality remains less pronounced in the
UK than in the US, Canada or Australia, it is greater than in some
Continental European countries.
However, it is difficult to accurately measure the earnings gap. It
depends on the statistical methods used, the data accessed and employed,
the populations examined and the time periods investigated.
A principal cause of earnings inequality in Britain between 1980 and
1993 was the disproportionately large increase in the earnings of the
''working rich''.
Prior to 1980, there appears to have been a decrease in earnings
inequalities, especially for non-manual workers. However, this changed
post-1980.
The greatest increase has been for non-manual female employees. This
largely reflects a change in the labour market with more women entering
the workforce and a growth in the service sector at the expense of
manufacturing.
As workplaces in general become more technology-based and
customer-focused, employers are increasingly appointing women because of
their perceived better communication skills and flexibility.
There are some who argue that a minimum wage is the answer. The trade
unions are attempting, so far unsucessfully, to get the Labour Party to
agree to a minimum wage of #4.15 an hour. However, it seems likely that
far from helping lessen earnings inequalities, a minimum wage could
exacerbate the problem.
It would do nothing to tackle the principal cause of earnings
inequality, namely the apparently disproportionate increases in earnings
at the top end of the scale.
Most people would not quarrel with the idea of someone who adds value
to society being paid well above the national average. However, what
does seem unjust is that selected individuals, often incumbents of the
job, derive great personal benefit from the structural shift away from
the public sector in favour of private sector working practices.
This has been blatantly the case in the privatised electricity
industry but has also been seen to a lesser extent in the NHS trusts
where the managers, often without any medical background, are paid far
in excess of what the doctors and nurses who previously ran the NHS
received.

SCOTTISH lawyers are not renowned for passing up fees yet Neill Clerk
is happy to invest its commission from introducing shares in the
upmarket branded leather goods retailer Revelation Piccadilly Holdings
to the Alternative Investment Market.
Revelation is raising #500,000 through AIM, a high-risk and
potentially high-reward quotations market for young companies.
Neill Clerk can trace its origins back to Greenock to at least 1776
and treasures a letter of instruction from James Watt. It is now
building up a head of steam in AIM with about 13 issues so far sponsored
and the expectation of introducing perhaps three small companies a
month. The advantage of AIM is that fees are just a fraction of those
for a listing on the Stock Exchange.
Revelation, which also retails under the name Leading Edge, has
indicated that sales for the year to next February will be around #4.36m
with profits of #97,000.
In 1997 and 1998, turnover may increase to #5.69m and #8.6m
respectively and profits to #279,000 and then #593,000. If achieved, the
shares now offered at 100p would be selling at just three times
earnings.
One minor incentive is that those buying 1000 will be entitled to a
10% discount on Revelation products ranging from Longchamp handbags and
Mandarin Duck luggage to Luna rock lava lamps.
This is the first time the now Glasgow-based firm has made a direct
investment in a client.

NORWEB, the regional electricity company covering North-west England,
continued its stand-off tactics against its two suitors even though one
of them, Texas Energy, the joint venture between Houston and Southwest
Corporation, yesterday lifted its bid to #10.85p a share cash, topping
North West Water's revised offer of #10.75p.
Norweb's shares firmed 5p to #10.87p.
''In view of the proximity of the two increased offers, the board of
Norweb, which is being advised by NatWest Markets, will not be
recommending either offer to shareholders for the time being,'' said a
statement from the company.
Norweb said Texas Energy's #10.85p a share offer is worth #11.35p a
share including advanced corporation tax.
North West Water's #10.75p a share cash offer #11 a share including
the tax, but its #11.06p shares and cash offer is worth #11.31p
including the tax.
A recommendation is expected to be made in due course in the light,
inter alia, of North West Water's share price performance and the
decisions of the various regulatory authorities, said Norweb.
A counter-offer from North West Water is also a possibility, according
to dealers.
Meanwhile, electricity regulator Offer has issued a consultation paper
on the planned takeover by the US group.
Offer director-general Professor Stephen Littlechild said the deal
would raise similar issues to those of other bids for UK regional
electricity companies, including that of the electricity supply licence,
which would be held by a subsidiary rather than a parent company.
Professor Littlechild said also that Texas Energy would have to
dispose of the holdings in the National Grid transmission system that it
would inherit if the proposed takeover of Norweb went through.
Offer said comments from interested parties should be received by
October 9.

ALBION Automotive's phoenix-like rebirth from the ashes of the Leyland
DAF group is a tribute to chief executive Dan Wright and his management
team.
The company's return to profitability in March -- two years ahead of
schedule -- and the launch of a new investment programme in July have
been crowned by the acquisition of a bus components plant from Volvo in
Lancashire.
But Albion's success also reflects the rise of independent component
manufacturers in a motor industry where the big names increasingly
assemble vehicles from bits and pieces that other companies make for
them.
The days of doing everything in house -- as in the offshore oil
industry -- are well and truly over.
The new arrangement gives big motor companies like Ford and
Mercedes-Benz more operational flexibility.
But it also allows the components factories to spread their eggs in
several baskets.
As part of Albion, Farington Components will be able to sell bus
components to both Volvo and its competitors in a way that was
impossible when it was directly owned by Volvo.
Albion, meanwhile, will be able to offer cost-conscious vehicle
builders a wider range of products from a single supplier. This should
make it easier for the Glasgow-based company to muscle its way into new
contracts.
Despite this diversification, a recession in the motor industry could
still lead to Albion and others like it coming unstuck.
Albion has benefited from a boom in commercial vehicle building since
it was rescued from the receivers two years ago, but, as Mr Wright
recognises, future growth is likely to be slower.
That said, it still looks as if this particular phoenix will fly well
clear of the flames for some time to come.

THE slowdown in the rate of consumer credit growth for August was out
of line with market projections but not, as yet, treated as any great
threat and the widening global trade gap in July was broadly as expected
so there were no market ructions there.
On trade, the picture which has emerged from recent months data is a
flat to slowly deteriorating underlying trend. Some market analysts
believe, though, that from here on exports and imports should grow
strongly as activity in key export markets recovers and a further
improvement in competitiveness feeds through.
Import growth, however, should also accelerate as the recovery in
domestic investment gathers pace so the net effect could be a further
modest deterioration in the trade deficit. This is something the markets
appear to be able to live with though if there is a real pronounced
slowdown in the economy, the scenario may be less acceptable.
The consumer credit figures did raise some muted concern about the
likely trend of retail sales following the drop in August but the rise
in the month is still regarded as buoyant enough, at any rate by the
standards of the current recovery.
The housing sector, though, remains unimpressive. Net lending for
housing did rise, from #911m to #1141m, but against this the net lending
data on dwellings for the last two months combined shows the smallest
rise since November 1992.
Housing undoubtedly continues to pose a threat to recovery,
particularly if exports weaken, because it affects consumer confidence
and spending.

BASIC trust (not to be confused with the new whizzo NHS administrative
variety) is the principal contractual relationship between patient and
doctor, which is why the unfortunate Brian MacKinnon was given the elbow
by Dundee University, but the puzzling feature of the whole affair was
his zeal to study medicine.
Are there similar obsessions, we wonder, for law or accountancy
degrees? It was the second public exposure of Glasgow's medical faculty,
following the challenge to its admissions policy at the Court of Session
in August.
Failure at Edinburgh's medical school, however, naturally selects one
for a proper job and real fame. You only have to look at that Charlie
Darwin, best known for his Aussie pop-star biography, the Origin of the
Bee Gees.
Enterprise zone
* INTENSE media interest is what we hacks euphemistically call it. It
translates to having assorted raincoats camping outside, endless flash
guns, and strange notes through the letter box offering untold wealth.
It either illustrates our lack of an adequate privacy law or the
downside of having a free and unbridled press.
At least it gave opportunities for the enterprise culture,
particularly among younger children, who were being offered fivers by
Her Majesty's Press in exchange for any titbits on you know who. Trouble
was that he'd left the school before they had even started. Twice, in
fact.
Nero me impune
* STILL on the medico-training theme, by far the best put-down last
week was from Dr Ian Banks plugging the BMA's argument on why fewer
doctors were volunteering for general practice. ''This is a Government
which works on the maxim: when in Rome, burn it.''
But Ian's media skills are well honed . . . he worked as a TV repair
man in Liverpool for many years before jacking it in to study medicine.
Try winning
* INTERNATIONAL rugby referee Ray Megson is also one of Edinburgh's
best-known solicitors. For many years his firm has been known simply as
Megson and Co, but now he has been joined by a new partner, Peter
Winning. With commendable modesty, Mr Megson thought it would be
slightly presumptious, if not tempting fate, to call the new partnership
Megson Winning. Even so, Winning Megson has a quite a ring to it. Let's
hope the firm lives up to its name.
Rambling routes
* WHERE would we be without judges who had never heard of the Rolling
Stones or think that the rhythm method is making love to the sound of
the James Last Orchestra?
Lord Allanbridge is the latest among Her Majesty's Judiciary to have
trouble with the vernacular, dealing with a case of assault from
Bathgate where four of the lieges emerged from a pub to be confronted
with another group of four.
The witness said that in the course of a conversation between the two
groups, the question was posed ''Do you want a rumble?'' Lord
Allanbridge interrupted to urge the witness to speak more clearly as
both he and the shorthand writer had to take notes of the evidence.
''Now you say they were inviting you for a ramble,'' his Lordship
resumed. The witness explained that the proposal involved a punch-up,
rather than a gentle stroll in the Bathgate hills.

THE first six months of the year are traditionally quiet for book
publishers with the bulk of sales occurring in the run-up to Christmas.
So it is no surprise that Bloomsbury Publishing made an interim loss of
#391,000.
The company had five bestsellers in the period, which included Joanna
Trollope's The Best of Friends.
Many new authors have been signed up in the fiction division including
former Booker Prize winner, John Berger. Bloomsbury does not expect to
be adversely affected by the recent demise of the Net Book Agreement.
A combination of success in its three new divisions, Paperback,
Children's and Home Reference, coupled with the major fiction and
non-fiction titles being released for Christmas, makes the company
confident of a good second half.

IT is the prerogative of undergraduates everywhere to be bolshie about
their place of learning. What's the point of being a student, after all,
if you can't have a good gripe? Most, though, it must be said, don't
transform their complaints into pieces of experimental theatre, which is
more or less what Casablanca's Artifact Theatre Company from the
University Hassan II has done in The Palmist.
I could be wrong, it could be that the education system in Morocco is
unusually oppressive, but I don't get anything from Mohamed Lechgar's
play to suggest that the problem is anything worse than a severe dose of
existential angst.
Presented as part of the enterprising International Festival of
University Theatre taking place across Glasgow this week, The Palmist
involves six actors identically dressed in a kind of eighteenth-century
school uniform, black blazers, long shorts with braces, and tight white
socks.
They perform a simple, monotonous routine, picking up their briefcases
and setting then down again. The point -- that they are academic
automatons -- is well made. Unfortunately they make it three times.
They're trying a difficult and demanding form of theatre, physical and
abstract yet rooted in ideas -- and for that alone they should be
commended -- but it does seem they've confused the ''human right of free
will'' with the student's right to read outside the syllabus.

The larger engine makes a vast difference in performance, says Ross
Finlay
SEVERAL of the latest generation MPVs have now been available for
test, although not all of them are yet in the showrooms. Introductory
drives suggest that, fully laden, some of the smaller-engined versions
will labour on hills or in situations needing some instant access to
power.
It is becoming clear that the new MPVs are not the over-hyped van
conversions a few cynics expected. There are, of course, only a few
individual designs, because of the badge-engineering involved. Some
manufacturers seem to be prepared to market their MPVs in small numbers
here, just to get a toehold in the sector, and they expect Ford to be
the market leader in terms of units sold.
Like its manufacturing partner Volkswagen, Ford has a V6 model in the
Galaxy range, which responds to the criticism that some of the two-litre
MPVs are likely to feel under-engined, when loaded with six or seven
people and whatever luggage they can cram in round about them. What to
do with the amount of stuff a full load of occupants may need to haul
around -- unless they go to the extent of fitting a roof container -- is
always going to be a problem.
Using VW's 2.8-litre VR6 engine, the biggest capacity Galaxy is sold
as a GLX seven-seater at #20,550 and as the top-specification Ghia
six-seater at #21,500. Ford has not bothered to offer this engine with
the base-level Aspen trim, named after the Colorado resort whose social
reputation must have come as a relief to its promoters, since that might
otherwise have gone to neighbouring towns with less euphonious names
like Leadville and Gypsum.
While the two-litre Galaxy models and the 1.9-litre turbo diesel
perform well enough when lightly laden, the 174bhp V6 transforms the
car's performance. It is not just a matter of improved figures like
0-60mph in ten seconds, although that is an eye-opener for the class, or
the test track maximum around 124mph.
On a motorway run to the Midlands and back, the test car was much more
responsive than any smaller capacity MPV I have driven. Mid-range
performance was far better, there was no fading in top gear on long
climbs such as the one over Shap, and the whole ''roadability'' was
noticeably improved.
An MPV's drag coefficient is pretty fair, thanks largely to the
one-box design and the front-end shape, which is not only a good
air-piercer but also an aid to straight-line stability at speed. The
Galaxy V6, with manual transmission, should be able to manage around
36mpg at 56mph, 28 on the motorway and 20mpg in town.
The test car was a GLX with two seats up front, three in the middle,
and two at the back. I have found with most MPVs, of whatever size, that
you can have generous legroom in two out of the three rows of seats, but
not in all three at the same time.
The Galaxy confirms this.
Seating is versatile, with swivel-round front seats, others that can
be removed completely, and fold-down seat-back trays. The manufacturers'
suggestion that MPVs might double as leisure vehicles and mobile offices
is not daft. I could see a vehicle like the Galaxy being a very handy
base from which, for example, to report on race meetings or rallies.
As usual, Ford has a long list of extra-cost options. I was quite
taken with one arrangement by which, if you remove the middle and rear
seats on one side, special clamps can be fitted to allow the transport
of a couple of bicycles, without having to take the bikes to bits.
Although the Ghia is the top-specification Galaxy for the moment, Ford
means to introduce an even more lavishly equipped Ultima version next
year. It will be interesting to see how the MPV market is shaping up by
that time. Will it be boom, or will it be over-supply bust?

Challenging the bench has its risks: Robert Dickson describes the
price of offering unsought advice.
CONTEMPT of court can arise if a witness prevaricates or is drunk, or
if someone wilfully challenges the authority and dignity of the court.
As long ago as 1822 the judges of the Court of Session were expressing
their judicial wrath in two separate cases. In one a letter had been
sent to Lord President Hope (the great-great-grandfather of the present
incumbent) ''containing matters disrespectful and insulting to the court
and injurious to the administration of justice''.
The writer, an Edinburgh solicitor named William Jamieson, originally
challenged the authority of the court to deal with the matter, but after
reflection withdrew his objections and instead apologised for the
original correspondence.
The judges found him ''guilty of a high offence against the dignity of
the court'', gave him a public reprimand, and ordered him to find
caution of #100 for his good conduct towards the court and judges for
five years. Jamieson, however, left Scotland and died three years later.
On the same day as the penitent solicitor was being rebuked, the
judges also dealt with John Hay. Hay was involved in a litigation which
he insisted on conducting without counsel or any form of legal advice.
Dissatisfied with the progress of his case he published an article
''wickedly defaming'' certain judges and attacking the administration of
justice in Scotland.
Unlike Jamieson, he refused to apologise or withdraw anything which he
had written. He was found to be in contempt, imprisoned for four months,
and ordered to find #300 security for his good behaviour for the next
five years. The following year he lost the court case which had been the
cause of his outburst.
The difference between Jamieson and Hay lay in the lawyer's abject
apology. A similar policy was adopted by a Birmingham journalist, a Mr
Gray, who was summoned to appear before Mr Justice Darling in 1900
following an article which he had written for a local newspaper.
Equating the judge to ''little titch giving fits'', Gray advised his
readers that there was not a journalist in Birmingham who had anything
to learn ''from an impudent little man in horse hair, a microcosm of
conceit and empty-headedness''. The report reminded the public that as a
young man the judge had been left a considerable sum of money by a
relative. ''That misguided testator spoilt a successful bus conductor,''
concluded Gray.
Faced with the prospect of a considerable time in prison the
journalist took cold feet and ''humbly apologised for using intemperate,
improper, and ungentlemanly language which was void of the respect due
to his Lordship's person and office''. He escaped with a fine of #100.
Not so fortunate, probably because he would not apologise at the time,
William Cordiner, who in 1972 was jailed for three years by Lord Stott
after he shouted and bawled at the judge who had found against him in a
divorce case. Cordiner unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence, his
petition being held to be incompetent, and he was returned to Saughton
Prison where his ex-wife visited him regularly.
Since the passing of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 the maximum
sentence for contempt has been restricted to two years' imprisonment.
Authority to impose such a sentence applies only to the High Court,
Court of Session, or where a sheriff is dealing with a criminal case on
indictment. There are, however, still powers elsewhere to deal with
those who are deliberately late for court, as one solicitor found
recently when he was fined by an irate sheriff for delaying the start of
proceedings.
As he signed his cheque to pay his penalty he may have longed for a
recurrence of the easy attitude displayed by Lord Justice Clerk
Aitchison in a case which had been remitted to the High Court for
sentence in 1936. The judge and the whole court was kept waiting for
half an hour by the lateness of the advocate who was due to represent
the accused.
No regret was expressed when the QC ultimately appeared and at the end
of the case an inquiry from the Bench as to the cause of the delay was
met with the blunt response -- ''my breakfast was late''. A benevolent
smile from the Bench followed and Lord Aitchison instructed his clerk to
call the next case. It seems unlikely that any of today's QCs would have
either the temerity or arrogance to adopt such an attitude in court.
Certainly one English solicitor, John Walsh, learned to his cost in
1992 that public criticism of the running of a court can be dangerous.
Complaining about the delay in reaching his case at Tamworth Magistrates
Court he was heard to remark ''any delay is as a result of the
ridiculous listing of cases by the clerk of this court''.
For his outspoken comment he was imprisoned by the offended Bench.
Three Appeal Court judges quashed the order, however, pointing out that
the absence of common sense on all sides had created a ''storm in a
teacup''.
It certainly seems unlikely that Walsh deliberately set out to upset
the court, unlike Mr Joseph Harrison who in 1938 hurled a bag of
tomatoes at the Appeal Court after he had lost his case. He was
imprisoned for six weeks and spent Christmas in jail, despite the fact
that his aim was as bad as his temper.
The prize for the person who deliberately set out to provoke the Bench
must go to the man who insisted on coming to court wearing nothing more
than a jumper and a pair of ladies' see-through tights. His attempt to
distract the court failed, however; the judge did not notice his attire
until the case was over and accordingly his protest was in vain.

Private Finance Partnerships are here to stay, maintains John
Gallacher, as private skills assist public works.
CONTENTIOUS legislation abounds in the Government's administration of
our economic affairs and those who anticipate Labour's re-election may
expect that, before long, such elements of Conservative policymaking
will be cast aside -- to be replaced by equally contentious
alternatives. Yet every government, in its passing, endows the nation
with at least one good idea, to be re-processed by its successors. One
such is the Private Finance Initiative (PFI).
Launched in 1992 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Norman
Lamont), it was enthusiastically endorsed by the Scottish Office,
described as disastrous in execution by the Opposition, but,
nevertheless, embodies a principle which seems likely to survive.
Ian Lang, when Secretary of State for Scotland, in a document entitled
Private Finance Partnership in Scotland described PFI as ''a sea change
in methods of public procurement''. Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown,
delivering a speech on ''Partnership for Investment'', dismissed it as a
''testimony to failure'', but proposed that our infrastructure be
improved ''through the partnership approach''. Both of them
acknowledging, from opposing standpoints, the validity of the principle.
Despite fairly frequent media references, PFI enjoys little credit for
what has been achieved by its facility, is low in general business
awareness, and is not readily quoted as a potentially successful
component of economic growth.
The fact is that in Scotland, at the end of August, the capital value
of completed PFI projects was #23.5m; schemes in progress were valued at
#43.5m; the project value under negotiation was #125.4m; proposed
projects amounted to #2554.5m. A grand total of actual, probable, and
possible projects estimated at #2746.9m.
That is a considerable amount for 36 months. Not surprisingly,
speaking in May this year, the Shadow Chancellor's perspective of PFI
arithmetic was different but, obliquely, he endorsed the underlying
principle, suggesting that the Government failed to see it as ''a
vehicle for a partnership between public and private sectors to increase
overall levels of investment''. In whatever form or under whatever name,
PFI is here to stay.
Conceived to involve the private sector in the provision and financing
of services and infrastructure traditionally regarded as the exclusive
domain of the public sector, PFI is not simply a continuation of the
privatisation and contracting-out doctrine. It was devised from
recognition that the costs (and the risks) incurred in providing
essential public facilities were mounting. It sprang from the view (not
entirely fair) that the public sector's record in design and procurement
of capital projects was poor. In the 1992 Treasury brochure Breaking New
Ground, the ''public sector culture'' is blamed for the inadequate
management of project risks.
''The design of the projects is usually in the hands of people whose
interest is to design them to high technical standards rather than to
strike a sensible balance between cost, return, and risk.''
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke wrote in the preface that it offered more
work and profit to the private sector and, for the taxpayer, an
efficient and economic way of delivering more quickly the improved
infrastructure and better facilities everyone desired. The Government's
opinion is that the public sector is not best-placed to make business
decisions and will benefit from the flexibility, efficiency, specialist
knowledge, management skills, and resources at the disposal of private
business.
Most of the Scottish projects relate to hospital and other healthcare
provisions, suggesting that it is in this field that PFI is a more
acceptable and practical way of funding capital schemes. However, to
date, this public/private financing structure has either met, or is
proposed to meet, requirements for roads and bridges (the Skye bridge,
for instance), water and sewerage, prison building, and education.
Resolved that, long-term, PFI will become a pillar of the UK domestic
economy, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke declared a year ago that the Treasury
will not approve any capital projects unless private financing options
have been explored. Presumably, he hasn't changed his mind.
PFI has a long way to go before all the practical problems which will
attend its application have been dispelled and it is acceptable to a
wide segment of private enterprise and investment. (There are examples
of faulty, not to say catastrophic, project planning of which Eurotunnel
looks like being a prime one.)
A fundamental factor will be the precision of a critical path analysis
in project planning. The targets, timetables, and budgets fixed by that
analysis have to be achievable and provision for contingencies more than
just adequate.
At a recent Scottish Financial Enterprise seminar on the subject, four
key questions were said to require very careful study and early
resolution if the initiative is to be absolutely sound. First, accepting
the stated enormity of PFI's market potential, will the UK private
sector (developers, construction companies, investors, advisers, etc)
possess sufficient resource to cope with the demand -- or will the
Government be obliged to control the flow of projects?
Secondly, how will delays -- in planning processes and fund raising --
affect the viability of a project?
Thirdly, since tendering for a project incurs savage expense (#500,000
is not unknown), how will unsuccessful candidates be compensated? Of
these questions, all but the last impinge upon funding. How much is
needed, where is it coming from and when, and what will it cost? The
salient component of the PFI is the financial sector.
The labyrinth of negotiation, calculation, and formulation revealed by
the PFI concept is convoluted and requires skilful manoeuvring.
Substantial tasks of planning, procurement, and execution have to be
contemplated. Preparation of tenders will demand meticulous care and, if
financial and material resources are to be in place and on schedule,
management must embark on the most searching preparatory analysis.
Above all, the funding structures must be copper-bottomed. Try clawing
back your underestimates from the Treasury!
A daunting but potentially rewarding challenge, which can confidently
be faced if both public and private sector interests have made the right
choice of advisers -- the bankers, accountants, and lawyers. Those
advisers will have to equip themselves to work with this new hybrid of
investment, be capable of creating new funding structures and opening up
fresh avenues of planning and procurement.
Such support teams will be, in effect, real risk managers, called upon
to perform with more than average excellence.

PARTNERS in major accountancy firms will be able to sleep more soundly
at night if the rest of the ''big six'' players ultimately follow KPMG
down the road of incorporation.
The knowledge that they are no longer putting their not-insubstantial
personal assets on the line every time they give a company's accounts a
clean bill of health will be a great relief.
Unlimited liability could almost be considered a personal trauma
waiting to happen. Take the Lloyd's Names, albeit that most must have
known that the huge returns they were chasing didn't come without a
correspondingly massive risk.
Accountants may argue it is unreasonable that they are prevented from
limiting their liability in relation to audit work by contract, unlike
other accountancy services.
But given the importance of a stringent independent audit to investors
and creditors, the law appears to be right in this case.
There is already massive pressure on auditors to proffer the opinion
that a major company's accounts give a ''true and fair view'', even if
they cannot resolve a difference of opinion with management regarding
the figures.
A decision to do otherwise could result in the transfer of the audit
to another accountancy firm. The consequent loss of substantial fees
would hit partners where it hurts -- in their pockets.
There may be less pressure on partners to qualify an audit opinion if
their personal assets are not at risk in the event of a lawsuit.
But there is perhaps little reason why accountancy partners should be
among the few who live with the worries of unlimited liability.
Incorporation should not devalue the audit -- providing they maintain
the highest professional standards.

I AM absolutely stunned at the decision of six members of Motherwell
District Council's planning committee who have granted an extension to
Tams Loup Quarry at South Blair near Harthill, bringing the quarry
workings to within 92 metres of the front door of the residents of a row
of cottages.
There are 70 residents living there, including two over 80 and a new
baby expected in a few months.
These six men have condemned these folk to 15-20 years of noise, dust,
blasting, and the danger of heavy traffic, not to mention the view from
their front windows.
The quarry at the moment is half a mile away and when blasting occurs
ornaments fall off tables and pictures on the wall swing about and
sometimes fall off.
One lady told me that she was sitting on her chair when she heard this
awful rumbling like an underground train, the floor under her feet
vibrated, and her chair moved a few inches with her sitting in it. This
extension would bring that to within 300 yards of the houses.
No-one should have to put up with that. Does Motherwell District
Council think more of money and power than of the ordinary folk who
probably helped put them where they are on the council?
Healthwise? Nothing but respiratory disease and dust clogged lungs.
What a future for all of them.

Paris
GUNMEN shot dead the editor of Algeria's main Arabic language
newspaper today in central Algiers, the latest victim in a relentless
surge of violence before a November election which Muslim
fundamentalists have vowed to wreck.
Omar Ouartilan, 36-year-old editor of the Arabic daily Al Khabar, died
near a press complex housing several newspaper offices, including those
of Al Khabar, his colleagues and an official statement said.
He was the third newspaper editor, and one of about 50 journalists and
media workers, to be slain in Algeria since June 1993. Previous editors
killed were those of the government newspaper, El Moudjahid, and the
independent Le Matin.
A colleague of Ouartilan said the gunmen struck as the editor was
leaving his home in Belcourt district of Algiers to go to the nearby
Maison de la Presse Tahar Djaout -- named after the first journalist to
die in the violence.
The official statement did not say who had killed Ouartilan, the fifth
journalist shot dead over the past month.
The authorities have blamed Muslem militants, fighting to topple the
government and who have vowed to wreck a planned November 16
presidential election, for their deaths and those of others since 1993
when guerrillas threatened reporters with death for their alleged siding
with the army-backed government.
Ouartilan was shot the day newspapers were carrying more reports on
one of the worst deliberate killings of civilians in the near-four years
of violence, during which more than 40,000 people have been slain in the
country of 28 million people.
Many Algerians wept as they watched television film on the massacre of
18 civilians shot dead on a bus on Sunday en route to a village market
in the southern provinces of Laghouat, 205 miles from Algiers.
Authorities blamed Muslim rebels for the attack in which 15 other
people, most of them children, were wounded.
* Twelve Algerian Islamic fundamentalists were jailed for up to five
years by a Belgian court today.
But their presumed leader, Ahmed Zaoui was acquitted. The men were
charged with forming a gang, possession of arms and explosives, forgery
and receiving stolen goods.--Reuter.

SIX years ago, Gerald and Vera Weisfeld sold their What Everyone Wants
chain of shops for #47m. Since they are not short of a bob or two and
they have been filling their time with demanding charitable work for
their Weisfeld Foundation, why are they opening a new department store
in Glasgow?
For Gerald, the answer is simple. ''Retailing and fashion are in my
blood,'' he says, having gone into the rag trade in London at the age of
15.
For Vera, it is not just getting back into business but one up to pass
on to future generations, an idea that has become a passion since going
to Bosnia with a lorryload of aid.
''I went with the idea that I must do something for the children but I
came back understanding that it was the old people who had seen
everything they had worked for destroyed and their families destitute
who were suffering,'' she said.
The sons of her first marriage, John and Michael McDonald, are
directors of Weisfelds but she clearly hopes her grandchildren will grow
into the business. The lone parent who worked as a sales assistant to
support her sons is still the boss. On the Weisfelds' notepaper, she is
listed as the president, clearly a reflection of her status in the clan.
''Vera does the talking, people like to listen to her,'' said Gerald,
assigning himself a backroom role.
The idea that they sold Whatevery's, as she calls it, to go into
retirement was a misconception, insists the diminutive figure in
stiletto-heeled, lace-cuffed ankle boots.
''We sold our business, not our brains. Everyone keeps telling us how
much business has changed but I can tell you it is exactly the same. The
workmen are still sawing wood and putting in the wiring three days
before the opening.''
When the doors open on Friday, only the basement and ground floor will
be in operation, the remaining six floors will be brought in gradually.
But that is part of the plan.
''We have to open this place for the Christmas business, otherwise
people would say we have lost it,'' she confides.
Mr and Mrs Weisfeld, as they address each other without the slightest
embarrassment, are confident they know what shoppers want, especially
Scottish shoppers, and in particular Glaswegians: it amounts to the
highest possible fashion at the keenest possible price.
Attempts to elicit their projected customers are met with an expansive
optimism which says they will compete simultaneously with Frasers and
with What Everyone Wants, which opened its new store a year ago in the
former Bremner's building only a block away.
Weisfeld's will take them on with a budget shop alongside designer
labels. Granny Weisfeld wants to dress her grand-daughters in pretty,
smocked frocks but knows that, by the age of 10, they are clamouring for
the latest teenage fad. She shudders at the idea of sleeves down to the
pre-teen fingernails but you can bet they will be on her rails.

Strathclyde University is turning the country's musical ethos on its
ear. MICHAEL TUMELTY tunes in to the philosophy of the Jordanhill
campus.
THE inauguration of a National Jazz Institute for Scotland, launched
on Monday, could have ramifications beyond the mere training of
tomorrow's jazz musicians. It could alter the perception of jazz as
something you either can do or can't, as something that can only be
learned on the road, in harness, and -- perhaps most significantly -- as
something arcane: life blood and soul food to its performers and
devotees, bewildering and incomprehensible to the man in the street.
That, at least, is the philosophical intention of the new National
Jazz Institute, based on the Jordanhill campus of Strathclyde
University. Mark Sheridan, music supremo in the department of applied
arts, has already presided over a remarkable innovation there with the
introduction three years ago of the BA degree in Applied Music.
Quite simply, this course turned on its head the assumption that forms
of music other than classical could not be subjected to the rigours and
disciplines of higher education.
''It is applied music,'' stressed Sheridan. ''That means hands-on; we
have a placement policy for our musicians -- they go out into the
community, into schools, and into the music business itself.''
And it has worked the other way round, too. Since the course started,
Sheridan has seen musicians working in the profession coming in to do
the BA, including a member of the group Aztec Camera and
singer-guitarist James King. ''They'd just decided they'd actually like
to do something to gain a degree, to redirect their lives,'' said
Sheridan.
The BA course is now big business, with 340 applications for 30 places
this year. ''And the skill level just keeps getting higher,'' Sheridan
said.
As part of the course development, Sheridan called in jazz saxophonist
Tommy Smith two years ago to teach improvisation and creative skills.
''We began talking seriously about the role of jazz and the development
of jazz in education,'' Sheridan said.
In due course, Bobby Wishart, guru of the Strathclyde Youth Jazz
Orchestra and tireless champion of the need for education in jazz, was
brought into the discussions. Sheridan described Wishart as ''the John
the Baptist of jazz -- crying out in the wilderness to get jazz into
education''.
And thus was born the idea of a centre, an institute for jazz studies.
Consultation took place with other interested parties -- from the RSAMD
to the Glasgow International Jazz Festival -- and investigations began
into existing models.
The legendary Berklee College (of which Tommy Smith is a graduate)
with its 50-year history and 3000 students was the obvious one. Larry
Bethune, dean of students at Berklee, visited the Jordanhill campus and,
along with American vibes player Gary Burton -- who has agreed to take a
role in the institute -- confirmed the Scottish team was on the right
lines.
The team then set about establishing how a course in the National Jazz
Institute should operate. ''It had to be part-time, for two reasons,''
Sheridan said.
One was finance. ''There just isn't the capacity in the government
funding of higher education to allow for this kind of development.
Therefore, it had to be fee-paying or financed by bursaries.''
The other reason was accessibility. ''One thing we did learn from the
BA course was that there were many hundreds of interested people out
there -- not just in schools, but in FE colleges or mature players who
have aspirations to develop their musical skills but who wouldn't
normally go near higher education.''
So Saturdays were selected, and a course and curriculum devised that
will extend over a 24-week period in the academic year. Each day will be
a five-session day embracing everything from harmony to history, from
arranging to performing in groups.
It is hoped that Wishart's Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra,
rechristened the National Youth Jazz Orchestra of Scotland, will merge
with the institute after next April, thus providing further performing
experience for the students. Contacts have already been made with
Scottish jazz festivals and promoters such as Assembly Direct, doubtless
with the hope of establishing some cohesion in the jazz scene at large.
However, Sheridan sees another potential in the institute, where he is
in charge of research. ''I'm particularly interested in establishing
research in all areas -- the proliferation of jazz, the teaching and
learning of jazz, how it might impinge on schools, how we can help
teachers. Most of them would like to get involved, but don't have the
tools to do it.
''One of our functions is to produce materials for use in the
institute's courses, but we can also help to produce materials that
teachers will be able to use in the classroom. We've done it in
classical, in technology, in rock to some extent.
''We can do it in jazz, to create a backflow from the course into the
schools -- covering the history of jazz, where it came from, how it
developed, and its appreciation.''
Jazz appreciation in schools? Now there would be a thing. Welcome to
the National Jazz Institute of Scotland.

POLICE are hunting for a man who raped a 12-year-old girl in a
three-hour ordeal behind a church after dragging her off a busy road.
Her attacker punched her in the face after she got off her morning bus
and then subjected her to ''a horrendous'' ordeal in the secluded
grounds of the church 100 yards away.
The man repeatedly threatened her but police said that any screams
would have been drowned out by the noise of traffic on the A64 Leeds
inner ring road.
After being freed, she ran sobbing with a bloody nose to nearby
offices.
Specially trained officers were speaking to the victim trying to learn
more about Monday's attack.
The attacker is described as white, in his twenties, about 5ft 7in,
with a shaved head and long fringe. He had a birthmark on his cheek and
was wearing a shell-suit.

The other sections of The Herald -- Business, Cars, Jobs, and of

The inbuilt suggestion that women can only be attracted by fashion and

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY
CANARY Wharf, Europe's tallest office building, completed its
rehabilitation yesterday with the news that it has been sold for #800m.
The buyer is a consortium of North American and Middle Eastern
investors including Paul Reichmann of Canada's Olympia &amp; York, the
original developer of Canary Wharf.
The project, in London's Docklands, fell foul of the recession which
hit London's commercial property market particularly hard.
However, a combination of economic recovery coupled with attractive
inducements has resulted in Canary Wharf's occupancy level rising to
around 75%.
Tenants include Mirror Group Newspapers, The Telegraph, Eurotunnel and
various banks.
The consortium of buyers has agreed to honour the contracts of
existing tenants in the complex, but the fate of the Canary Wharf
management led by Sir Peter Levene is unclear.

<TEXT>
THE US state of Illinois has accused insurance giant Lloyd's of London
of fraudulent practices that may cost some residents their life savings,
officials said.
Secretary of State George Ryan's Department of Securities issued a
seven-count administrative notice to Lloyd's alleging the firm misled
Illinoisans by failing to say how risky the investments were and sold
unregistered securities.
John Gurley, a lawyer for Lloyd's, said he wanted to review Mr Ryan's
allegations before responding.
Lloyd's troubles can be linked in part to insurance involving the
Exxon Valdez and Hurricane Hugo catastrophes.
It is unknown how much money Illinoisans may lose, said David Urbanek,
Secretary of State spokesman. But Mr Urbanek said some individuals could
lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Lloyd's lost nearly #10bn on bad risks over a six-year period
beginning in the late 1980s, Mr Ryan's office said.
Lloyd's representatives ''solicited investors in Illinois by using
Lloyd's 308-year tradition in the insurance industry as a marketing
tool,'' Mr Ryan said. The case is set for a hearing on December 19 to
see if the company should be banned from selling securities in Illinois
or face fines up to #6000. -- AP.

<HEADLINE>Weisfelds set up shop once more. Former WEW owners invest millions in new department store concept.</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT POWELL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>23</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976060591</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 25 years after they founded the nationwide chain of WEW
discount stores from a single clothing shop in Glasgow, Vera and Gerald
Weisfeld are doing it all again -- but this time in rather grander
style.
The couple and Vera's two children by her first marriage, John and
Mike McDonald, have invested millions of pounds in a seven-storey
department store tucked away behind the unfashionable end of the city's
Argyle Street.
The new Weisfeld store, which opens to the public on Friday, is a much
more ritzy affair than the ''pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap'' WEW shops
they pioneered in the seventies.
Mixed in with the less-than-a-tenner bargains are a sprinkling of more
refined designer items, such as jeans by Versace and men's suits by
Giorgio Armani.
And the Weisfelds have learned a thing or two about customer service
in the US since they sold their chain of WEW stores to Amber Day for
#50m in 1990.
There is a large play area, complete with bouncy castle, where mums
and dads can leave their offspring with minders while they empty their
wallets in other parts of the store.
There is also a special facility for picking up purchases by car when
you finish your shopping instead of lugging them back to a distant car
park.
Finally, there is a much wider range of stock, attractively displayed
in a pleasant air-conditioned environment.
By mid-1996, when all seven floors of the former Goldberg's store are
expected to be operational, customers will be able to buy goods ranging
from mock snakeskin boots to bedroom furniture and anything from a
postcard of Glasgow to a holiday in Greece.
Within the store there will be a travel agency specialising in group
travel and several concession shops selling items such as Rangers and
Celtic memorabilia and golfing equipment.
But Mike McDonald said the guts of the business would still be cheaper
goods. ''We are certainly selling more upmarket, but we like the volume
that discount retailing gives,'' he said.
Mike, 31, and his brother John, 34, will be in charge of the
day-to-day running of the store. Their mother Vera, 57, and step-father
Gerald, 55, will concentrate on longer term strategy.
''We will eventually step into the background and they will take
over,'' Mrs Weisfeld said.
The Weisfelds bought the building for #1.85m from Goldberg's receiver
earlier this year and have invested more than #1m in fitting it out. But
they are vague about the total cost of launching the new venture, saying
only that it involves ''many millions''.
Mr Weisfeld said the business plan called for profitability within
three years, but he and his wife emphasised that they would play it by
ear and adjust the product mix according to what the public wanted.
''When we open this store the public will tell us what they want,''
said his down-to-earth wife who hails from Coatbridge.
The Weisfelds acknowledge that their approach is unconventional, but
ever since they launched their first shop selling cheap dresses round
the corner in Argyle Street in 1971, they have believed in ''the
university of life'' rather than the schools of academia.
''My education was in the stockroom at the age of 15,'' said Mike
McDonald, when asked if he had studied at a business school.
The Weisfelds are playing hard on their traditional Glasgow
connections, hoping that they are well enough known for people to walk
the extra 100 yards from Argyle Street up dingy Candleriggs to visit
their new store.
''I think in Glasgow we have a reputation of value for money, and in
the trade we have a reputation for being prompt payers,'' Mrs Weisfeld
said.
Their 250 future employees will certainly hope so since the basic rate
of pay in the store is only #3.50 per hour.
The Weisfelds eventually plan to expand, opening other stores
elsewhere in the UK. But Mr Weisfeld said it would probably take a year
to get the Glasgow store fully operational and the product right before
they began opening new branches.
Mike McDonald said the family would consider buying a whole chain of
shops and converting them instead of opting for a slower shop-by-shop
expansion.
Perhaps the Weisfelds are still frustrated by their failure to take
over the Poundstretcher chain last year. It was eventually bought by the
South African group Peokor.
Only three of the new store's seven floors will open for business this
week but a further two should open by the end of the month.
Mrs Weisfeld said they could not afford to wait longer and miss the
Christmas trade. ''We would have been mad to sit on this store until
January,'' she said.

New statistics on the health of Glasgow's cultural sector do not tell
the whole story, says Bob Palmer, Director of Performing Arts, who, as
Ruth Wishart discovers, has his own ideas on the way forward.
IN the heady days before consultants persuaded the world to lend them
its watch in order to tell them the time, certain things were self
evident. Among them, that the health and vitality of any city were
enhanced where the population could readily fi nd both entertainment and
spiritual nourishment.
So, in the seventies the arts mattered because the arts mattered. In
the eighties they fell victim to the prevailing mood of everything
requiring to prove it was a worthwhile investment by means of
quantifiable returns.
Bob Palmer, director of performing arts in Glasgow, remembers 1987 as
the year the Arts Council Annual Report fell victim to the dispensers of
jargon and their comrades in confusion, the assemblers of statistics.
This week, as he examined the latest piece of research commissioned by
Glasgow City Council on the health of the city's cultural sector, he
made the point, rather forcibly, that there were many ways of taking its
pulse besides crunching a fairly glaze-inducing set of numbers.
''It gives you a useful part of the picture, that's all.'' For what
it's worth, however, and in terms of continuing to justify and attract
investment, it's probably still worth a lot. The digest offers a few
interesting snapshots in its basic comparisons between 1986, the first
year there was a real attempt to gauge the economic impact of the arts,
and 1993, three seasons beyond the annus mirabilis of 1990. More usually
it tries to detect trends between 1989 and and 1993.
The bald stats -- excuse me, ''76 tabulations information held in the
statistical framework'' -- suggest that 9000 people are now directly
dependent on the cultural industries for an income, and that the overall
economic value has grown by just over 40% in the decade and is now worth
some #420m.
It is Palmer's assertion, however, that the indicators, both good and
poor, should be part of a more holistic approach to looking at where
cities should be going. He is just as interested, he says, in the
results of a six-city international study, including Glasgow and just
under way, that looks at the role of the arts not just in terms of
income, but in terms of social impact.
''I think we've been through a whole series of different periods in
the way we looked at the arts. Before 1970 there was a genuine
enthusiasm in terms of things like quality of life, aesthetics, and
educational value. People talked about passion, belief, and vision. In
the eighties we became preoccupied with the economic impact.
''And that led on in cities like Glasgow to talking about the arts in
terms of urban regeneration and image improvement.'' Stage four, he
contends, will be more focussed on what the arts can do for the
individual in terms of linking a generation with the society from which
it may have become alienated by personal disasters such as unemployment.
In that context, Palmer suggests, the endless debate over what
constitutes community arts is largely irrelevant in the sense that the
ability to underpin confidence and explore potential is actually more
crucial than actual content.
Similarly, while heated controversy may be engendered by whether or
not packing theatres with warmed-over tartan farce is detrimental to
Scottish theatre and new writing, or whether unadorned broomsticks on
walls is challenging, conceptual art or a load of self-indulgent
cobblers is not, argues Palmer, really the point.
''I've always felt that you had to look at the overall picture of what
is on offer; look at the mosaic as a whole. It may be that 1700 people
attending something not particularly challenging is considered more
valuable to the city than 60 people riveted by a difficult but
innovative exhibition. I would argue that the canvas should have room
for both.''
That art should always have the freedom to fail, that its popularity
should never be a crude litmus test of its worth, goes without saying.
But there are still some pointers in this new statistical portrait of
Glasgow that it would be folly to ignore.
Later this week, Scottish Opera will come under the microscope as the
committee examing the options for its orchestral provision reports back.
But the fact that it can now mount 11 fewer performances of productions
than it did in the early nineties is a sign that it may have to redefine
its role. Similarly disppointing is the drop, from 124 to 88, in the
number of classical orchestral concerts.
And while nobody could be expected to sustain the hyperactivity of
1990, it is surely dispiriting that the city with the brand new concert
hall attracted just five visiting orchestras in 93/94 compared with 22
three years earlier.
Much more heartening is the range of new venues and the vigour and
scope of the artists and performers who now have the city as their base.
Palmer believes that in addition to basic facilities and population
size, achieving a critical mass within the artistic community,
particularly in high growth sectors such as design, is a crucial
prerequisite of continuing cultural prosperity for any town.
Yet the visual arts offer a very mixed picture: a minor explosion of
studio and private gallery space, but a steady downturn in attendances
at the city-owned museums and galleries. Julian Spalding, galleries
director, reminds you that attendances are still the best outside London
and dwarf the centrally-funded national galleries and museums in
Edinburgh. He rejects any suggestion of complacency with previous
figures, and offers instead a range of what he considers critical
factors.
The Burrell collection, down to not much more than a third of its
launch audience, suffers, Spalding says, from not being able to lend
abroad. More generally, he cites major internal reorganisation of the
400-strong staff ''geared to focussing on our visitors rather than
ignoring them''; educational cutbacks that have seen a drop of more than
200,000 in numbers of pupils able to visit; and the creation of an Open
Museum geared to taking the collections to the consumer.
But as the digest coyly notes, attendances at galleries ''is much
affected by the number and appeal of individual exhibitions,'' and
Spalding must be relieved to have blockbusters with Mackintosh, Hockney,
and Picasso well advanced, plus next year's opening of a new Gallery of
Modern Art.
Palmer, contemplating a future that will be performance-led rather
than venue-led, must also hope that there are enough # signs snuggled in
these latest statistics to encourage  further blessings from the civic
kitty of the new local authority.

KPMG yesterday confirmed itself as the first ''big six'' accountancy
firm to protect the personal assets of its partners in the event of a
slip-up by one of them in a major audit.
The partners have voted in favour of incorporating the part of the
firm which audits publicly-quoted clients and the likes of banks,
insurers and financial advisers in the regulated financial sector.
Scottish senior partner Archie Hunter, based at KPMG's Glasgow office,
said: ''That is the area we have identified as the one that gives us the
risk.''
Other accountancy firms are seriously considering incorporation to
protect partners' personal wealth, although Ernst &amp; Young said yesterday
it was not keen on incorporating only part of its practice.
Legislation allowing incorporation of professional practices was
provided for in the 1989 Companies Act and introduced in 1991. However,
KPMG has stepped up its push towards incorporation during the last 12
months.
Mr Hunter said the move had been driven almost exclusively by the
incidence of claims against accountancy firms and the fact that there
seemed no change or shift in law to protect partners who currently have
unlimited liability.
Accountancy firms, because they are perceived to have deep pockets and
also because of their major insurance cover, often bear the brunt of
legal claims for loss.
An investor, for example, could claim he relied on a ''clean'' audit
opinion when he invested in a company and that the opinion ought to have
been qualified.
If he subsequently suffered loss, even though other parties might be
adjudged responsible for the bulk of the loss, the accountant could be
sued for the entire amount because of joint and several liability
provisions.
Similarly, if one of KPMG's partners was to make a mistake, the cost
would be a joint and several one among the firm's 585 UK partners.
Commenting on the existing unlimited liability arrangement, Mr Hunter
said: ''In the event of a mega-claim, all of our personal assets are at
risk, albeit that we ought not to be responsible in that proportion.
''We are not trying to duck absolutely reasonable liability for any of
our actions. All we are trying to do is give ourselves the protection of
limited liability which the law allows us.''
He stressed KPMG currently faced no ''life-threatening'' claims.
KPMG Audit, a public limited company with a projected annual turnover
of about #100m, will take over the major audits next year.
It will account for about one-fifth of the business of the KPMG
organisation, which will continue to audit unlisted companies and
provide accounting, tax advisory, corporate finance, corporate recovery,
and management consulting services as a partnership.
KPMG plans to publish accounts for the year to September 30 just ended
and subsequent years, which will detail partners' income and their
respective stakes in the firm.
The combined accounts of the partnership and KPMG Audit will
ultimately be audited independently, though not by a ''big six''
competitor.
Partners will continue to receive the same level of profits from the
audit work being transferred to the new limited company, subject to
maintenance of an adequate equity base, but without risking their
personal assets in this area.
Accountants cannot, by law, limit liability on audit work by contract,
although they can do so with other services, and this is the rationale
for KPMG's decision to incorporate only the high-risk part of its
business.
However, a spokeswoman at Ernst &amp; Young's Glasgow office said her firm
was not at all keen on incorporating only one part of its practice,
believing this would offer little personal protection to partners and
would be culturally divisive.
Ernst &amp; Young, however, will incorporate if it can keep down
additional costs and be satified that the arrangement offers a high
level of personal protection while not significantly changing the firm's
partnership culture.

LONDON-based Premier Land, the latest owner of Aviemore Mountain
Resort, yesterday signalled that little would change at the
investment-starved complex if public grants were not forthcoming.
In a statement released through the Stock Exchange, the property
investment company said: ''In the event that grant funding does not
become available, Premier Land will consider improving some of the
existing facilities and continue operating the resort broadly as at
present.''
At a hastily convened press conference in Edinburgh yesterday, just
hours after overnight negotiations saw Premier Land's purchase of the
Aviemore leisure resort finalised, chairman Desmond Bloom outlined
ambitious plans to invest between #15m and #20m in the ailing complex
over the next two-and-a-half years.
However, he made it clear that the prospect of grants had been
''vital'' to his company's decision to buy the centre and expressed his
hope that a ''substantial percentage'' of the proposed investment
programme would be publicly funded.
Premier Land's #7.425m purchase of De Veer Investments, of which
Aviemore Mountain Resort is the principal asset, had been expected.
The company also announced a #6m, five-for-twelve rights issue at 5p
which will fund the #2.025m cash element of the purchase price and also
improve its working capital position.
Premier Land unveiled plans for a new swimming pool complex, a museum
of Scottish history, a new access road from the A9 dual carriageway, and
71 additional chalets.
As well as promoting Aviemore as a movie location, the company plans
to turn the resort's existing 700-seat cinema into a two-screen complex.
Mr Bloom hopes British company Metrodome, which was behind Leon the
Pig Farmer, will make two full-length feature films on location at
Aviemore. Paul Brooks, chairman of Metrodome, was described by Mr Bloom
as a ''long-standing friend''.
However, the investment programme proposed at Aviemore was greeted
with scepticism by the Highland town's chamber of commerce and community
council.
Although Mr Bloom admitted that Premier Land had so far had no serious
negotiations with the likes of Highland Regional Council and Highlands
and Islands Enterprise about grants, he was ''optimistic'' his company's
applications for aid would succeed.
He dismissed any suggestion that it was holding the public bodies --
which are as keen as Premier Land to see Aviemore revitalised -- to
ransom by making clear the proposed investment programme was dependent
on grant funding.
Mr Bloom said: ''We are certainly not in any position to hold anyone
to ransom. We think it is an example of mutual interests coinciding.
''I think it is a team effort. We will be working to the same end.
There is no question at all of any kind of ransom.''
The remainder of the purchase consideration will be satisfied through
the issue of #3.1m of Premier Land shares to the vendor and loan notes.

Theatre
THIS is scarcely credible. Glasgow's department of performing arts has
booked an English touring company to play for a week in the city's main
civic theatre with stagings of works by C S Lewis.
So what, you say? Well, consider the timing.
Theatre for children and young people has finally fought its way up
the Scottish arts agenda; funding bodies are finally putting resources
into the form; companies such as Visible Fictions and Hopscotch are
producing a high standard of work; and Communicado's Tall Tales for
Short People is on the shortlist for about every award going.
What's more, the English company, on the evidence of this performance,
are as uninspired as they are dated in their approach.
This Vanessa Ford production is an attempt to stage the best-known of
the Narnia books in a shallow, story-telling fashion. There is no
attempt to interpret Lewis's Christian allegory for the CD-Rom
generation, and the cast of young adults employs squeaky voices to
suggest childhood (Claire Nicholls, as quiz-show hostess Lucy in a D-cup
party frock, is particularly irritating).
They were only occasionally out-voiced by a revolving stage mechanism
in need of a drop of oil. It is part of a tacky set, including localised
snowfalls that defy meteorology and desperately unimpressive
pyrotechnics to accompany the magic.
The young audience around me was decidedly unimpressed, only really
coming alive during a short slapstick fight sequence involving Brian
Parr's Baldrick-like dwarf, sidekick to the White Witch.
He and Louise Barrett as the witch were the show's best assets, but
that's not saying much, and her other role as housekeeper Mrs Macready
was straight out of Dr Finlay. The production as a whole had all the
posturing vacuousness of the worst excesses of the English stage, with
added extra condescension as a treat for the kiddies.
The company is performing this show again today (10am and 1.30pm),
Lewis's later ''prequel'' The Magician's Nephew tomorrow (1.30 and 7)
and on Friday (7), and both in story order on Saturday (3 and 7).
Buy your offspring the books, take them to a movie, buy The Lion King
video, or save your money for the superb Action Factory programme for
children in the October Week.

<HEADLINE>Trade gap grows to #1056m but it causes no stir</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with the rest of the world widened to
#1056m in July compared to June's #868m, but this was in line with
market projections and caused no stir in financial markets.
Analysts were not so accurate in their prediction for consumer credit,
where the increase of #535m in August compared with a forecast of around
#615m and was well below the #681m recorded in July.
The rise in net lending is the smallest since September last year, but
the July figures were exceptionally strong and virtually all of the
slowdown reflected a fall in lending by the banks, while borrowing on
credit cards slipped from #139m to #119m.
Consumer credit still grew by 0.9% month-on-month and 12%
year-on-year, although the figures did prompt some worries about the
trend of retail sales after August's decline, albeit that was influenced
by the hot weather which hit some items.
The extent of any recovery will be seen when the official retail sales
for September are published on Wednesday, October 18.
So far as the trade figures are concerned, the increase in the trade
gap was largely influenced by oil and erratic items defined as ships,
aircraft, precious stones and silver.
Stripping these out leaves the deficit little changed over the month
at #1397m against June's #1441m, with exports up from #11.2m to #11.5m
and imports from #12.6m to #12.9m. Non-EU trade has been deteriorating.
In overall terms, in the three months to July, the visible trade
deficit increased to #2938m from #2597m in the preceding three months.
The reduction of #800m in the deficit with the EU was more than offset
by a worsening of #1100m in the deficit with non-EU countries.
The Central Statistical Office said the latest estimate of trend
suggests the whole world visible deficit is widening. However, the
Treasury said the underlying picture for the balance of trade was
better.
In volume terms, after again excluding oil and erratics, the volume of
exports rose by 3.5% and the volume of imports by 3% compared with June.
The trends here show both rising slightly.
In the three months to July, there was a 2% rise in exports, entirely
the result of a 3% rise in the volume of exports to EU. During the same
period, imports from the EU were 1% higher and those from the rest of
the world rose by 5%.
Trade Minister Anthony Nelson said exports had again risen to record
levels. Although the trade deficit continued to widen, it was noticeable
that industrial rather than consumer demand had been driving imports up,
he said.
He added: ''Apart from fuels, where trade will still have been
affected by the maintenance of North Sea installations, this increase in
imports has been in semi-manufactures, intermediate goods, and capital
goods which will be primarily for industry.''
* BRITAIN'S underlying official reserves rose by $126m in September.
The total at the end of the month was $47,182m (#29,815m).

GEORGE Robertson quite understandably protests at the tag ''traitor''.
I can think of no greater insult.
Surely, though, nobody should be surprised that such language is now
being used at this stage of the constitutional debate. Mr Robertson
firmly believes that his party's stance on the question of Scotland's
destiny, that it should remain within the Union, is the right one.
Labour are unequivocal on this issue, unlike their approach to other
issues such as minimum wage and taxation levels, where they are
unwilling to commit themselves at the present time.
If they were as open-minded on the future road the Scottish parliament
they promise is established should taken then I am sure the rhetoric
would not be so offensive. Unfortunately this is not the case, because
the Labour Party believes in the Union.
In the other corner are those Scots that believe the best course for
future generations lies in self-determination. Their belief in an
independent Scotland transcends the other political opinions they might
or might not hold. Their belief in nationhood is more akin to a faith
than to a political conviction.
As both camps justify their positions the distance between the
unionists and the nationalists is becoming unbridgeable. Labour in its
efforts to persuade the Scottish voter of the merits of devolution has
to talk down independence and so for example letters are written to
Scottish newspapers by economists from respected Scottish institutes
casting doubts on the economic viability of independence.
Nationalists ask themselves why an economic expert and fellow Scot
would arrive at such conclusions when they know from the obvious
prosperity of the other similar European nations and the undeniable
wealth in natural resources in and around Scotland that the opposite
would be the case.
SNP activists see these continual attacks by Labour on the case for
independence as not only an erosion of individual Scots' aspirations but
as a betrayal of Scotland's historic struggle. And so the name-calling
not surprisingly has degenerated to its present level.
George Robertson as leader of the largest political force in Scotland
has a duty to consider the constitutional issue at a far greater depth
and maturity. He should take a lesson from his boss, the leader of the
British Labour Party -- commit yourself to nothing and rule out nothing,
including independence.

Paris
FOREIGN Minister Herve de Charette said today France faced no real
international pressure over its South Pacific nuclear tests and accused
the media and the Greenpeace environmental group of hyping opposition.
Hoots of derision rose from opposition benches when he told
parliament: ''There is strong media pressure whipped up by some, but
there is no international public pressure against French nuclear tests.
''The public (anti-nuclear) movement which the press writes about does
not correspond to reality.''
His statement during question time reflected the mixture of
exasperation and disdain with which the French government has responded
to a fresh wave of outrage over this week's second underground test in
French Polynesia.
De Charette said he met foreign ministers from many states at the UN
General Assembly in New York last week and ''I can reassure you --
France is still welcome''.
He was speaking after a storm of criticism broke yesterday after
France exploded a 110-kilotonne nuclear warhead at the Fangataufa atoll
testing site in the South Pacific.
The strongest reaction was from Pacific countries including Japan,
Australia and New Zealand, and the South Pacific Forum cut ties with
Paris today in protest against the blast.
Criticism also came from most of France's European Union partners and
the United States and Russia expressed regret.
De Charette laid much of the blame on the environmental pressure group
Greenpeace, which has spearheaded opposition, suggesting that the origin
of its financing was murky.
''Here is an international association with resources valued at 800
million francs (#90.5m), which we are told comes from various donations
and membership fees. What a fortunate association,'' he declared.
During the Cold War, some French ministers expressed suspicions, never
substantiated, that Greenpeace was financed by the Soviet Union.
De Charette said Greenpeace ''has never been mandated by anyone but
has the gall to lay down international law to everyone''.
He added: ''They should not count on us to obey them.''
The minister said Greenpeace, which has an active branch in France,
would not be impeded so long as it respected French law. ''But the
minute they step beyond legality, they can count on us to stop them,''
he said.
His statement reflected discord among French ministries over handling
of the media during the controversy.
The government initially allowed media coverage of the Pacific test
site and of navy operations to thwart Greenpeace protests at sea.
Some officials complained that the policy of ''openness'' gave even
more publicity to protests and the French authorities clamped a virtual
news blackout on the second test.
The high commissioner in French Polynesia was reported to be convinced
that riots there after the first test on September 5, were in large part
provoked by the huge media presence.--Reuter.

SO George Robertson, Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, doesn't
like being called an ''Uncle Tom''. Fair enough, it doesn't fit. The
dictionary definition of it is: ''An American negro who is submissive or
servile to white Americans, the ascendant settlers of their place and
time.''
The black Americans of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have
our understanding and admiration. Fine, patient people, forcibly
enslaved, they were kept in ignorance and often brutally treated. From
time to time they must have smiled upon their masters to save themselves
or their families from the gallows or worse.
But no-one is oppressing George Robertson. Of his own free will he has
joined the established ascendancy. It has rejected full employment as a
worthy objective for the Scottish people and has accepted in its stead
the universality of the market-place. So what are growing numbers of
unemployed, temporarily employed, or never-have-been employed to think,
hope, or do?
George Robertson and his party are now creators of today's Uncle Toms:
''Sign the secrecy clause? Yessir!'' ''Overtime: who needs pay?'' ''Blow
the whistle and I'll blow my job?'' ''Don't worry JJ, I'm your man!''
They can be found, bound and gagged, throughout the paid and salaried
workforces.
So let's just call George: ''Uncle George''.

ON MONDAY, September 25, you published a most unpleasant barrage of
girning from three politicians: George Robertson pompously preaching
against naughty words used by SNP officebearers, Norman Hogg worrying
about how dangerous the SNP is, and Henry McCubbin unable to see the
benefits of Independence in Europe. All this was orchestrated in an
effort to spoil the positive impact of a very successful SNP conference.
This Monday, coinciding with the conference of what used to be the
Labour Party, the SNP has not stooped to such tactics as George
Robertson's mischievous insinuations. Instead, our exemplary behaviour
has been rewarded with a System Three poll putting Labour six points
down and the SNP up 30%.
How deeply satisfying! Yes, the SNP is dangerous -- for sitting Labour
MPs.

YOU ran three features recently which painted a remarkably bleak
picture of Moscow life. Until now, I have always associated
sensationalism with the tabloids and it was sad to see The Herald
peddling that commodity.
I don't know how often your correspondent has visited Russia; not
often, I suspect, because what she has to say is old hat. OK, Moscow is
a dangerous city -- rather like New York, Marseilles, Barcelona and
other cities which I have visited and lived to tell the tale.
I have also seen surveys showing that the chances of being mugged (or
murdered) in New York are much greater than in Moscow. And were there
not seven murders in one night earlier this year in Glasgow?
But that is not the important point. Moscow is not representative of
Russia any more than London is of the UK or Edinburgh of Scotland. Where
there are threats there are opportunities and in Russia opportunities
abound for anyone willing to invest time, energy, and money.
Nizhni-Novgorod, Krasnoyarsk, and Glasgow's twin city of Rostov-on-Don
among others are places where business visitors are welcome and safe. I
have made the point many times that the rest of the world is investing
in Russia while we sit on the sidelines.
Trade with Russia is important for two reasons; to generate income for
the investor and to encourge Russia to maintain contacts with the West.
It is vital that trading links be established and developed and articles
like those in your paper last week do no-one any service.
Your correspondent should arrange to visit Rostov to meet people who
are working to achieve economic and social regeneration, a difficult job
which should be helped and not hindered by the Western media.

CAN you imagine my surprise?
I went along to the East Kibride pictures with my wife who is nine
months pregnant. We went to see The Bridges of Maidson County. This is a
weepy picture that sees most of the women at the cinema reach for the
hankies. As I find this type of behaviour amusing I accidentally spilled
half of my popcorn when I caught my wife having a wee bubble to herself.
At the end of the picture I scanned the audience to see if any other
men were bored out of their head. I did see a man who was looking and
listening to the popcorn crunch underneath my feet as I eased past him.
Alas, how was I to know that it was my favourite paper doing a film
preview armed with nothing more than a soft hat and sharp pencil
(October 2). No nachos wth chilli peppers for Jack Webster!
Sorry for the distraction, but at least it kept him awake.

THANKS to Jack Webster for confirming that I am not alone in my
abhorrence of ''munchers'' at the cinema (October 2).
My heart sinks at the first rustling of the sweetie bag and the nerves
are stretched at every unwrapping of the contents. The blood pressure
goes up as the hands plunge into the huge popcorn packet and I listen to
the munching.
I recently went to see Braveheart and sank into a deep depression as
the soundtrack competed with the guzzling and scrunching. And, of
course, there was the interval when the hordes rushed out to replenish
their rations and it all started again!
If Jack Webster ever finds a food-free cinema I would be delighted to
accompany him and I promise not to hold his hand at the scary bits in
the film as I am prone to do with perfect strangers.

I SHOULD like to clarify a number of misconceptions in William J
Harris's letter about the windfarm currently being constructed at
Hagshaw Hill, Douglas (September 16).
Before Clydesdale District Council decided to grant planning
permission in accordance with our officials' recommendation, I visited
windfarm sites in Cornwall where similar equipment has been installed.
An assessment of both noise and environmental issues was made. The fact
of the matter is that there will be no perceptible noise from the wind
turbines at Hagshaw Hill.
The creation of a further 20 jobs in the Douglas Valley is to be
welcomed. The windfarm company is forming a trust into which
approximately #15,000 will be deposited per year in order to generate
community development projects in the area over the next 30 years. This
contribution will create a continuing social and economic benefit to the
community.
Mr Harris stated that the private company erecting the wind turbines
is ''wasting money'' on their intention to allow visitors to view the
windfarm. He may not be aware that in the first year of a similar
development in South Wales 25,000 people were attracted to visit the
site with the obvious spin-off to the local community in terms of
tourist spending.
I cannot respond in detail to the condition of roads and pavements in
the area as I am a district councillor and the matter is a regional
function.
Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder but these elegant structures
sit happily in their setting, create clean energy for future
generations, and act as a reminder that the vast majority of people in
Clydesdale and the Douglas Valley are prepared to embrace new technology
of this type in locations which are suitable for the purpose.

Baton Rouge
THOUSANDS of Louisiana residents began leaving low-lying coastal areas
today as Hurricane Opal churned across the Gulf of Mexico, threatening
the coastline and scores of offshore oil and gas platforms.
Others were still hoping the storm would veer further east to spare
the state. ''I don't want to wish ill on anybody, but I sure hope it
passes us up and goes somewhere else,'' said St Bernard parish emergency
management director Bob Broccamontes.
Hurricane Opal's winds strengthened to 90 mph, and forecasters
extended a hurricane watch east of Pensacola, Florida, as the storm
churned through the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Centre
reported today it had veered more to the northeast, increasing the
likelihood it will hit land along northern Florida, Alabama and
Mississippi.
Opal was moving north-northeast at 8mph and was expected to turn more
easterly at a faster pace during the next 24 hours, the hurricane centre
said. The watch area extended from Morgan City, Louisiana, east past
Pensacola, Florida, to the mouth of the Suwannee River.
Offshore natural gas operators in the Gulf rushed to shut down
production and evacuate workers from platforms. About 40% of US Gulf
production was shut down by yesterday as producers tied down platforms
against the storm.

IF Bill MacLeod were a racehorse, he would be an unlikely entry for
the Grand Laughter Stakes. A glance at his breeding reveals a sire from
Lewis and a German dam. As he concedes: ''I've a double handicap in
terms of humour.''
At least in poking fun at himself MacLeod proves he has one of the
necessary credentials to dupe the handicapper and direct a comedy
programme. He's the man who will carry the can if Ran Dan, a Gaelic
satirical sketch show that starts a four-week run on BBC2 tomorrow,
fails to raise a titter from an audience starved of humour for the past
17 years.
That's how long it's been since BBC Scotland's Gaelic department last
attempted to tickle Gaels' ribs with Norman MacLean's hugely popular
Tormod air Telly. It is almost as if, in the interim, the Gaelic
Department has been terrified to fill MacLean's boots.
Ran Dan has been talked of for two years, but it was only this April
that the dense grey layers of bureaucracy at Queen Margaret Drive
finally parted to allow a ray of light into the October scheduling. The
result, by BBC standards, is four half-hour programmes put together in
August and September at remarkable speed, thanks to the verve of all
involved.
In fairness to the Beeb, such a programme was probably out of bounds
until recently. MacLeod points out the debt Ran Dan owes to the National
Gaelic Arts Project, based in Stornoway, which has nurtured young
writing talent, and to programmes such as Scottish Television's Machair,
which have expanded the small core of Gaelic actors.
One of the biggest finds, according to MacLeod, has been Calum
MacKinnon who, until the arrival of Ran Dan, was a barman in the Crown
Hotel, Stornoway. ''We put him in front of the camera, and he really
shone,'' MacLeod said.
As well as pulling pints and faces, MacKinnon's versatility extends,
in partnership with Seonag Monk, to supplying many of the scripts.
MacLeod feels the two hours of material that will go out over the next
four Thursdays vindicate the Gaelic Department's decision to opt for a
broken comedy format, rather than a sitcom.
''I am confident the viewers will be entertained and provoked in a
quite extraordinary way by Ran Dan,'' he says, knowing that 17 years on
Gaels still yearn for a programme to replace Tormod air Telly --
especially as BBC Gaelic programming in recent years has been dominated
by news and current affairs.
So how is Gaelic humour defined? ''Some humour is universal, but all
cultures have their own particular humour which doesn't translate,''
MacLeod says. Seamus MacMillan, one of the show's main writers, believes
it is no coincidence that some of the funniest humour around comes from
the Jewish, Irish, and Scots Gael cultures, all of which have a long
history of oppression.
Ran Dan works on a mix of wry, earthy humour and modern satirical
writing. There are some terrific caricatures, and none more so than
those of Finlay MacLeod, the Gaelic playgroup Ayatollah and a man noted
for his, er, earnestness.
Other targets include Bonnie Prince Charlie, portrayed here as an
effeminate wimp; a marvellous pair of White Settlers; and the well-known
anti-Gaelic ranter, Jean Gurnie. Sadly, The Herald's John MacLeod ended
up on the cutting-room floor.
* Ran Dan, 7pm tomorrow, BBC2.

THE leaders of Borders Regional Council meet Scottish Office Industry
Minister George Kynoch tomorrow to appeal for aid to diversify the
region's industry in the wake of a textiles crisis which has cost
hundreds of jobs.
They will also highlight the problems in the region's two other
traditional employment sources -- fishing and agriculture. More than
2000 farming jobs have been lost in the last 20 years and continue to
decline by 100 a year. EU policies have helped reduce fishing jobs on
the Berwickshire coast.
Mr Kynoch will face a strongly-argued appeal backed by the
deliberations of a summit meeting held at Borders region headquarters
yesterday to map out a future industrial strategy. The meeting was
attended by the two Borders MPs, Sir David Steel and Archy Kirkwood,
local authority leaders, and representatives of Scottish Borders
Enterprise.
The key arguments in the lobby for increased assistance will be that
eligibility should be based on gross domestic product rather than
unemployment figures.
According to regional director of planning Paul Gregory, the most
recent figures show a Borders GDP of #6911 per head, compared with the
Scottish average of #8123. He says: ''Not only are we at the foot of the
table but our position as a region has got worse.''
Despite Borders job losses, a tradition in the region of moving out to
find work produces employment statistics which are misleadingly better
than the Scottish average.
Sir David Steel said: ''We will lobby for the yardstick to be changed.
The Borders has a low wage economy and the lowest GDP of any region in
Scotland, which is worrying. We are also well below the average for
office employment and we will make a particular pitch that the insurance
and financial sector, research facilities and satellite offices could be
occupying space in the Borders at lower cost to employers than
elsewhere.''

THE O J Simpson trial has come to its conclusion, and delivered its
verdict -- not guilty -- after months of forensic acrobatics, judicial
deliberation, and racial agonising. It delivered also a distinct flavour
of theatre, but only at the best; at the worst it was a media circus. To
foreign viewers -- it was all televised -- it often seemed as much
dominated by considerations of the needs of the TV screen as by
considerations of justice. It certainly afforded unconscious
commentaries on the role and nature of the law in contemporary America
(though perhaps all legal cases in every society really do much the
same); on the significance of stardom; and of racial identity in the
world's greatest democracy and richest society. To British minds the
whole procedure was often bizarre (and the outcome astonishing), but
that response has to be balanced by the thought that so much about the
United States is familiar to us, mainly because of Hollywood, that we
tend to forget how very different it really is. This case celebrated
that difference in a courtroom where almost everyone seemed to be on
trial as well as the accused; certainly many witnesses in effect were on
trial, notably one Los Angeles policeman; even the judge was at one
stage, while the jurors may yet face a somewhat similar ordeal.
There is little point in gainsaying the verdict. What matters is that
it satisfies Californian opinion, and American opinion more generally --
but will it? It looks as if opinion will divide along the fault lines of
colour, as it already had in surveys of public opinion about the
likelihood of guilt. Seen from these shores all the worst fears about
the nature of the US judicial system have been realised: an element of
farce has been unmistakable, money has talked, loudly as well as
eloquently. Fifteen million dollars were spent, six of them by the
defendant. There were 24 principal lawyers in the court and many times
that serving these behind the scenes. The jury's unanimity is surprising
given the evidence, though it may have been informed by the civil
consequences of a guilty verdict -- widespread racial rioting in Los
Angeles itself and possibly in other American cities as well. The racial
dimension of this affair is uncontestable -- the victims were white, the
accused black -- and throughout the trial this dimension has been a
continuous ground bass, even if not always openly acknowledged. Yet such
considerations should be irrelevant to a jury which needs to focus only
on the evidence and not on possible social reactions to its verdict
which has to be on that evidence.
Foreign observers, surely, but many Americans as well, will be puzzled
by the verdict, particularly by the absence of any dissenting voice
among the jurors. There will be less respect than before for the
American legal system but particularly for its Californian variety. It
has been a strange affair, as compelling and peculiar as any fiction
filmed on the spot, an identity which will not be entirely banished by
the recognition of the fact that it was all for real.

POLICE in Edinburgh were liaising with Interpol last night in a bid to
identify a woman in her 20s, who was found dead in Leith yesterday
morning, and her male companion, who was found unconscious nearby.
A dock worker found the couple lying beside each other at Prince of
Wales dock at 9am yesterday -- close to the new Scottish Office
headquarters. They are thought to be foreign nationals, possibly German.
The man, described as being in his early 30s, was taken to Edinburgh
Royal Infirmary, where he was said to be critically ill in the intensive
care unit.
Police said they could not rule out a drugs link, at such an early
stage. A post-mortem examinationon the woman is expected to be carried
out today.
Officers were still searching the area for clues last night, as well
as liaising with Interpol in a bid to identify the couple.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said: ''The incident is not
being treated as suspicious but a drugs link cannot be ruled out at this
stage.''
Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, more than 170 youngsters from schools
throughout Lothian were learning of the dangers of drugs and other
health issues at a seminar organised by Church of Scotland drugs
counsellors from its Simpson House Drugs Counselling and Related
Services.
Third and fourth-year pupils from local authority and public schools
in urban and rural areas learned of the risk through a series of
workshops covering the issue.
Project manager Anne Gray said the initiative was vital in the
education of youngsters.
''It's not telling anyone what to think or do, rather the day has been
devised to offer young people a forum to discuss what factors --
physical, emotional, and spiritual -- affect them in coming to a
decision about their use of drugs,'' she said.
Youngsters attending the forum, which was also addressed by police and
doctors, said they had found it useful.
Iain, 14, who claimed ''nearly everyone'' he knew at his school had
been offered drugs at some time, said: ''It's good to learn more about
why people can become addicted.''
Stuart, 13, also admitted drugs were ''common'' among his peers, and
said: ''I've found it useful, although I would never want to take them
anyway.''

Five years after Pat Lally's unrelenting and immensely successful
pursuit of a new Glasgow concert hall, Keith Bruce finds him busily
preparing to realise more cultural dreams.
THE Kremlin that is Glasgow's City Chambers -- a nickname not confined
to the administration's detractors -- found a companion piece in the
mausoleum that council leader Pat Lally had built at the top of Buchanan
Street. Many thought the missionary zeal with which Pat pursued his goal
of a new concert hall for Glasgow might bury him.
The morass of local authority spending restrictions and complex land
deals with property developers and development agencies threatened to
stall the whole project. But Lally would not be deterred from what the
Evening Times described (in 1987) as ''his vision''. When one builder
confessed to being unable to meet the construction deadline -- allowing
the hall to open during Glasgow's year as European City of Culture, 1990
-- the company was replaced by one that could.
Lally recalls the sequence of events with clarity. Discussions had
been going for some time with architect Sir Leslie Martin for the actual
design. The plan for a hall to replace the beloved St Andrew's Hall,
destroyed by fire in 1962, went back as long as the receipt of the
insurance money for the building. Invested, it had grown to some #8m,
but was still a long way short of what was required.
The developers were still looking for an ''anchor tenant'' for the
building as the steering committee in the city council were putting the
finishing touches to the structural details for the new hall.
''I took the attitude that if they were property speculators it was
time they started speculating,'' Lally says now. ''We needed the #10m
for the site to fund the hall.''
He claims that agreement was reached with the developers, Grosvenor
Properties, but the company subsequently came back with a list of
conditions and council patience ran out. Advertisements were placed to
put the site on the market again and that proved the spur Grosvenor
needed. When the ads appeared, they came back again with a firm proposal
and the project was off the ground.
More council money was found through realising assets and reinvesting.
Packages of council land were transferred to Glasgow Development Agency
for its own plans and the cash was put towards the hall. Also #8m of EC
funding was forthcoming. The total bill for the hall was widely quoted
at #32m, but probably exceeded that.
Whatever public opinion is of Martin's design -- and at the time it
was widely seen as an attempt to emulate monolithic East European
structure just as the Communist bloc was crumbling -- the building
itself has proved enormously popular with audiences, attracting capacity
houses to folk events in the difficult post-Christmas period, and middle
of the road music fans in high summer.
Yet it remained isolated at the top of Buchanan Street as GDA plans to
create a thoroughfare that rivalled the best in Europe faltered. Work on
the site next door has started for the hall's fifth anniversary, a
timescale not exactly envisaged when the building went up.
''It had to be an objective to open the hall in 1990. I don't think
there has been a hall built as speedily anywhere in the world as that
one. In the end of the day we did it for 1990.''
By then it was inevitably dubbed Lally's Palais and the councillor
agrees that he took some personal pride in its completion.
''I never believed it wouldn't happen, but I've stuck my neck out on a
number of occasions and you always risk having your head chopped off.
But the whole city should take pride in it.
''Ideally the shopping development would have proceeded alongside the
hall but they weren't in a position to start. At least it is happening
for the hall's fifth anniversary and will be completed in time for
Glasgow's year as City of Architecture and Design in 1999.''
But Lally concedes that that alone will not create the prestigious
city boulevard envisaged by the GDA.
''That is largely out of our control. The George Hotel is
architecturally a fine building but it is an eyesore just now. It has to
look much better by 1999 than it does today. If the present owner
doesn't want to develop it, he should give someone else the opportunity.
He is making no contribution to the success of the city or of a great
street.''
Lally scoffs at the charge levelled at the time that the hall was
another example of spending during 1990 that was aimed at a cultural
elite -- an accusation neatly counterbalanced by the outrage of
classical music fans when the hall's director Cameron McNicol made clear
that he would progamme a range of events similar to those he had
overseen at London's Albert Hall.
''It is the city's hall and has to appeal to all tastes. We have free
community concerts so that everyone is able to come. 1990 was never
elitist. There were nine million attendances at events. You can't have
nine million people at elitist events.
The Labour leader's personal taste became a real issue over the art
that was commissioned to hang in the foyer of the hall. Strathclyde
Regional Council organised a competition to mark its involvement with
the building and a committee of art experts chose two large canvases by
Ian MacCulloch. When they were unveiled, Lally immediately expressed his
distaste.
Five years on the McCulloch paintings will be replaced with four new
pictures, as part of the build up to the city's festival of visual arts
next year. The announcement is next week, and the news already reported
by The Herald's art critic Clare Henry, but Lally is saying nothing.
Next year, of course, he loses his position of power as leader of the
Labour council when long-time rival Jean McFadden takes over as leader
of the new unitary authority. Lally concedes that the council decides
its representation on the board of the hall, but is hopeful at least
that his chairmanship at Lally's Palais will continue.
And Glasgow Cultural Enterprises, the ''wholly-owned subsidary'' of
the city council, which was set up to circumvent Government restrictions
on council spending and runs the hall, could conceivably branch out into
other areas of activity.
There is little prospect of Councillor Lally bowing out of the city's
cultural life in the spring.
''I understand that I will have an important role in the organising of
1999, both a political role and on the board of the company being set up
to run 1999.
''There is no shortage of things I want to do or believe need to be
done. I have a whole host of personal projects for 1999 -- it's unlikely
I'll be able to realise tham all. And if I thought I could, I would just
add others.''

AN MP last night defended his highlighting of the level of exclusions
from schools while his son was under suspension from his local
secondary.
Mr Brian Donohoe, the Labour MP for Cunninghame South, told his
critics: ''Far from being a hypocrite, I believe that I am the best
possible advocate for change in what is a disturbing situation.''
Mr Donohoe confirmed that his son, Craig, had left Greenwood Academy
and was now at Kilmarnock College. He was suspended after a fight.
Two weeks ago, Mr Donohoe produced statistics which showed that around
25,000 pupils had been excluded from Scottish schools. He maintained
that some schools were viewing exclusion as ''an easy option''.
Mr Donohoe said yesterday that he had been ''taken aback'' by media
coverage of his son's suspension and, in particular, an accusation of
hypocrisy from a teaching union's leader.

NUCLEAR is one of those words -- which, in Scotland, also include
''Tory'' -- that has come to be a means of stopping rather than
stimulating thought.
Let me give an example. An editor of my acquaintance, faced with an
unanswerable argument on the need to control the trade unions or to
reduce public expenditure, used to cut the dispute short by saying,
''Oh, but that's just Tory!'' And this, to his own satisfaction,
relieved him of any need to examine the actual merits of the case.
We need not be too hard on this trait of human nature. If we stopped
to go to the bottom of all the abstract issues that touch on our daily
lives we would never have time for living them. We have to take some
things on trust. But people who take things on trust are open to
manipulation, the more so in this age of the sound-bite and the slogan
which can be given instant, universal currency.
Why else did a company once quite happy to call itself British Nuclear
recently decide to call itself something else? The answer is obvious:
that otherwise everything it did, however charitable or philanthropic,
would have been regarded with suspicion, if not with fear and hatred.
What that company is up against in trying to turn an honest penny
struck me on reading the morning papers. In several (though not this
one) the report of the landing of spent nuclear rods at Scrabster was
directly cross-referenced to President Chirac's vainglorious defiance of
the world over his tests in the South Pacific: see page 94 for more news
that will make your flesh creep . . .
This would be a bit like cross-referencing a story of a pile-up on the
M8 to another about an attack by Serbian tanks against some town in
Bosnia. Why not, on the same criteria? Neither tragedy could ever have
come about without the internal combustion engine. It ought to be
staring us in the face that we are confronted with a fiendish technology
destroying the human scale of our world.
The cross-reference would indeed be stronger in this second case
because, year in year out, thousands are slaughtered by the internal
combustion engine, in total many times more than have died through
nuclear energy, even taking Hiroshima and Nagasaki into account.
Protests there are in plenty, from people living in trees in Pollok and
others. Has not the time come for action? As a minimum we should learn
from the wise foresight of our fathers, who legally enacted that every
mechanically propelled vehicle must be preceded by a man on foot
carrying a red flag.
Most of us can recognise this train of reasoning as blinkered,
fanatical nonsense, not because it is in itself illogical but because it
is a true reductio ad absurdum. Of course there are dangers and
disadvantages in the internal combustion engine, but sensible regulation
can deal with most of them. We have to pay a cost, in lives and in other
ways, but self-evidently our societies are ready to pay it. The
advantages of cheap, universal mobility are overwhelming.
I wonder why the same commonsensical attitude, taking every factor
into account and weighing each against the others, is so often ruled out
by blinkered fanaticism when it comes to nuclear energy. Nuclear energy
is, after all, more natural than the internal combustion engine. The
engine had to be invented, whereas nuclear explosions take place the
whole time in nature, on the sun for example.
In nature the explosions are uncontrollable. But we possess the means
to limit the physical reaction at the heart of them, the fission or
fusion of certain atoms. So, assuming that sensible regulation sees to
careful and efficient control, we have a source of energy which can
never be exhausted so long as the universe exists, one no more and no
less natural than the power of the wind or waves often offered as an
alternative.
In practical terms the decisive consideration should then be cost.
Nuclear research and development, and construction of power stations,
are expensive. But once the initial investments are over, nuclear energy
becomes extraordinarily cheap. That is why in Scotland we pay less than
anybody else in Britain for our electricity, because so much of it is
generated in nuclear power stations. It has yet to be shown that the
other potential natural sources of energy, wind and waves, can in
reality work out so cheap.
But, as with the internal combustion engine, there are dangers and
disadvantages. Nuclear explosions produce fatal radiation. We know that
from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We know it all the more because we have
found that people exposed to too much radiation from the constant
nuclear explosions on the sun can, even over a distance of 93 million
miles, contract cancers and die from them.
The answer is sensible regulation of the nuclear reactions we produce
down here. There is no reason, once the risks are identified and
safeguards are in place, why the radiation should be uncontrollable, any
more than the explosions are uncontrollable. We make both: they are on
our, not nature's, scale.
Accidents have happened, at Chernobyl or, indeed -- a much less
serious case -- at Dounreay, but that was because the people in charge
were still ignorant of some risks and imposed inadequate safeguards.
The state of knowledge advances, however. As it does, it is in
everyone's interest to respect nuclear regulation, just as, with the
spread of the motor car, it is in everyone's interest to respect the
rules of the road. Only blinkered fanatics can pretend we have in the
nuclear industry something essentially uncontrollable. Compared with the
risks, the advantages of cheap and inexhaustible energy will in the end
be overwhelming.

A SCOTTISH police force has been getting a dog's eye view of the world
as it tests a hi-tech crime fighting device.
Tayside Police yesterday unveiled a miniature dog-mounted camera which
can be used to track armed suspects and search for drugs.
The tiny camera is mounted between the animal's ears and the dog also
wears a chest pack which contains an infra-red camera and a transmitter.
Officers can view sharp pictures on a small monitor which can pick up
transmissions from up to one kilometre away from the dog.
The device would be used in armed siege situations to keep officers
out of danger and also in drug searches and hunts for missing people in
inaccessible places.
The WOLVES (Wireless Operational Link and Video Exploration) system
has also been designed to video record the transmissions received from
the dog camera.
The #7000 device is currently under test by Tayside Police in Dundee
and dog handlers have been impressed by its performance in training.
Sergeant Ron Fyffe, head of the force's dog section, has put the
system through its paces with his German Shepherd police dog Brude.
Sgt Fyffe explained, ''It's applications are almost limitless.''
The camera has been specially designed to fit comfortably on the
animal and is already used by police forces in England.

THE deep, clear well of passionate morality from which Mr Tony Blair
draws his political convictions was evident to all who heard him in
Brighton yesterday. It was an emotional performance, blending the
patriot with the evangelist to such an extent that an appeal to come
forward at the end would have brought delegates down to the platform in
droves. It was a speech which must have sent shudders of apprehension
through his Tory opponents. It was not, however, quite the speech that
was expected. Having dealt with the modernisation of New Labour in
recent months Mr Blair was expected to turn his attention to the
electorate at large and to provide the outline and costs of at least
some policies in reasonable detail. In fact his address was aimed
equally at his own party and at the electors, though without the
expected policy details.
The reasons for this became evident when the tone and substance of Mr
Blair's speech made clear his belief that there will be another party
conference before the next General Election. This view being held, he
declined to make specific spending promises on top of Mr Brown's #1000m
windfall levy on the privatised utilities from the previous day. We have
criticised Mr Blair and New Labour frequently for avoiding a more
extensive unfolding of policy details. That criticism stands, though no
doubt it will be put right in time. What Mr Blair did yesterday was to
go beyond the demand for detail and to launch his party into quite a
different sphere which genuinely encompassed that notion of political
vision which has become so tawdry in other hands. Mr Blair made it worth
while, comprehensible, and desirable, and for that reason if for no
other it was possible to suspend judgment on the missing detail for the
moment.
It is a long time since it was possible to say that the style and tone
of a political speech mattered more than the detailed content, indeed to
admit this makes us uneasy. Nevertheless, Mr Blair embarked yesterday on
a moral and patriotic appeal of considerable power which must have
connected with that section of his party which has lamented the more
managed and packaged elements of his transformation of the party.
Christian Socialism may not be the force it once was in the party, but
yesterday it seemed alive and flourishing. Similarly, the patriotic
element of the speech, although entirely unforced, was something of a
surprise in the intensity with which it was delivered. At a stroke Mr
Blair demolished the happy vision, beloved of so many Tories, of the
Union Jack-waving delegates at Tory party conferences. Waving the
colours at Blackpool next week may now be a self-conscious gesture.
Those policy details, perhaps better described as embellishments,
which did emerge yesterday were intriguing, strangely reminiscent of Mr
Harold Wilson's ''white-heat'' of technology, described in the party
manifesto for the 1964 election as ''A New Britain -- mobilising the
resources of technology under a national plan; harnessing our national
wealth in brains, our genius for scientific invention and medical
discovery; reversing the decline of the 13 wasted years . . .'' Anyone
listening to Mr Blair yesterday and who fought the 1964 election would
have found that eerily reminiscent, though no less believable. Some of
the embellishments were overstated. Wiring every home in the country for
the Internet is excessive; making sure that anyone who wants to use the
technology can have access and knowledge is quite a different matter and
surely more achievable. Yet even here Mr Blair's growing self-confidence
shone through. Negotiating with British Telecom and Mercury for free
connection of schools, libraries, and hospitals in return for market
opportunities was delightfully cheeky and opportunistic. Elsewhere his
emphatic reaffirmation of a Scottish Assembly in the first year of a
Labour government should be sufficient to silence the doubters. The
impression which Mr Blair made in this speech, surely his most important
to date, was immediate, powerful, and prime-ministerial. It will go a
long way to answering his critics, both inside and outside the Labour
Party, and it will certainly bring a shadow to Tory hearts.

ONCE upon a time there was a young and radical leader of the National
Union of Students who struck fear into the heart of the political
establishment.
Then there was a young and radical special adviser to a Labour
Minister, pushing for better education and fairer, much fairer, social
provision.
That young and radical adviser became a slightly older but no less
radical Labour MP, tipped for stardom and carrying the hopes of those
whom he had inspired on the way up.
But the Palace of Enchantments to which he came every day did its
respectable work on him. And somewhere in that palace he met a most
beguiling Prince Charming, who managed to knock off the last spots of
radicalism and replace them with a polish much more to the supposed
liking of Southern Tories.
So changed did this getting older and less and less radical MP become
after meeting Prince Blair, that he even trumpeted aloud his dislike of
beggars and winos and squeegee merchants and all the hate figures of
Colonel Blimps in the Home Counties.
And thus it was that yesterday morning a much older, and not radical
at all Labour MP, Jack Straw, was putting on a brave face after being
knocked off Labour's NEC.
Certainly the Byzantine nature of Labour NEC elections has contributed
a little to Jack's downfall. He did, after all, get 8000 more votes than
last year, when he was successful, but as everybody's vote went up,
Jack's slide down the beanstalk of popularity in his own party is worth
considering. A great deal of it must be due to his recent attack on the
poorest in society, an attack that may have had the backwoodsmen of the
shires muttering in support but which horrified large sections of
Scottish society, as a recent article in The Big Issue (the magazine
sold on street corners by some of those whom Jack now despises) clearly
shows.
Jack's thesis, if it can be dignified by such a name, is not a new
one. Society is being sponged on by a variety of shiftless people who --
if they won't pull their own socks up, should have them pretty sharply
pulled up by society. It is the type of saloon bar philosophy that Tory
candidates used to think went down well at selection meetings in the
shires, but even Scottish Tories like Michael Forsyth have usually
fought shy of such simplistic scapegoating, at least in public.
The reason is not difficult to see. A casual glance around Scotland
today will indicate to any inquirer that the cause of our problems is
not those who will not work or want but the unjust and unfair system
which penalises the poor. It is a system institutionalised by the
Tories, who took it one step further this very week with the
introduction of new regulations that disadvantage those who pay a
mortgage but lose their job. Now the victims of Tory policies will be
ineligible for mortgage help for nine months -- nine months of worry,
poverty, and possible eviction.
If Michael Forsyth were ever to launch a high-profile verbal mugging
like Jack Straw's he would be pilloried in the press and torn to pieces
on television. Yet Jack, south of the Border, thinks not only that he
can get away with it, but that it is the way to out-Tory the Tories, to
get the plain people of Purley flocking to the booths in support of New
Labour.
And in that view he is not alone, as all the events of the Labour
Party conference this week have shown. Lemming-like, the massed ranks of
Labour's front bench have been queueing up to demonstrate their new Tory
credentials by denouncing an unknown prospective candidate whose only
misfortunes are to disagree with her leader on public service cuts and
to live with the editor of a particularly turgid internal Labour
magazine. At the same time those same leaders have avoided any
commitment to social justice and much needed left of centre values.
What, however, will it profit Tony Blair or Jack Straw, or any of the
new-look Labour leadership, if they gain the whole world and still lose
the soul of their own party? For seeking office and power on a false
prospectus is a dangerous and ultimately futile goal. If you accept your
opponent's agenda, and win on it, then you are trapped in it for ever.
Yesterday Tony Blair talked of the ''Generation of Labour'' and a
generation of power. His words had all the awful empty echo of Harold
Wilson's boast of Labour as ''the natural party of government''. But for
all Wilson's trimming he never totally sold the pass of social justice.
That tough task is one that Tony now relishes.
Of course, the really tough tasks are being ignored. The tough option
for Jack Straw and those around him is not to be tough on those who are
struggling to help themselves. The tough option is to work for a society
in which the weak are protected, the infirm made well, and those who
cannot survive in the cut-throat world of old Tories and New Labour
looked after with a helping hand.
I know from my correspondence that there are many outside Scotland who
despair of New Labour and who hanker after a party that speaks strongly
and truthfully about real change. This week's opinion polls show that
such feelings are also gaining substantial ground in Scotland.
We will be judged not on how many scapegoats we can find to load with
the blame for the ills of our society, but how we help those who have
been scapegoated far too often. And, of course, how we cure those ills.
Single mothers yesterday, beggars today and tomorrow -- who knows,
perhaps immigrants, with other minorities the day after.
Jack, your fairy-tale journey is taking you down some very dangerous
paths. They are paths that few in Scotland will wish to tread with you
or ''New'' Labour.

TWO steel knives found on a British fugitive who allegedly murdered
and dismembered a South African tourist were ''perfect'' for cutting up
limbs, a British prison official adept at butchery testified in
Singapore today.
The testimony by James Quigley, a prison caterer for 20 years, came on
the second day of the trial of John Martin Scripps, who is charged with
killing Gerard Lowe in March.
If found guilty, Scripps, 35, a prison runaway who is suspected of
being a serial killer, faces a mandatory death sentence.
Lowe's headless torso, thighs and legs were found floating in black
plastic rubbish bags in Singapore harbour about a week after the murder,
allegedly committed in a Singapore hotel room.
Scripps allegedly befriended Lowe when he arrived on a shopping trip,
shared the hotel room with him and killed him to steal his credit cards.
Mr Quigley testified that he and two other men, including a
professional butcher, taught butchery skills to Scripps after he went to
Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight in February 1992 while serving a
13-year sentence for drug trafficking.
Mr Quigley told the court that Scripps was a ''quick learner and
competent'' at his 10-hours-a-day job of dissecting and deboning beef,
sides of bacon, pork and chicken.
The prosecution's says that after killing Lowe -- possibly with a 3lb
hammer he possessed -- Scripps used his kitchen talents to neatly
dismember the body at the bone joints and pack them in a suitcase before
disposing of the parts.
While Quigley spoke, Scripps sat hunched inside a steel-framed glass
enclosure, wearing the same clothes he had worn yesterday: beige
trousers, black shoes and a grey-green collarless shirt.
Before the hearing, his mother Jean put her hand through an opening in
the cage and stroked his face a few times and left the courtroom.
When prosecutor Jennifer Marie showed Quigley two steel knives with
serrated four-inch blades found in Scripps' bags, he said they would be
''perfect instruments for dissecting and deboning''.
The reason: the knives have a ''very sharp point for making the first
incision,'' he said.
He also testified that the anatomy of human and animal joints is
''basically the same''. A skilful person could have removed the arm from
the torso in five minutes, he said.
But on cross-examination, Quigley acknowledged that ''a lot of effort
would have to be made'' to cut up the body using the small knives
compared to a butcher's knife, which has a 10-inch blade.
He also said Scripps was a model prisoner, not prone to violence,
well-mannered, cool, calm and someone who thought out his actions well.
Scripps worked in the Albany prison kitchen from March 1993 to August
1993, when he was moved to a low-security prison in Hertfordshire, from
which he absconded during weekend home leave in October 1994.
Scripps has also been charged in Thailand with murdering a Canadian
tourist and her son a few days after the Lowe murder, and has been under
investigation for murders in Mexico and San Francisco.

HOW do you deal with embarrassment? When you do something totally
cringe-worthy, do you casually laugh it off, do you tilt your head up
and brazen it out, or do you blush to your roots, inwardly collapse, and
desperately wish the ground would open up and swallow you? I fall into
the latter category, with a slight variation; I wish the ground would
open up and swallow everyone else. A sort of destroy-all-evidence ethos.
''No-one here can live,'' I think. ''They must not be allowed to
reveal this episode to anyone else. They must die, die, DIE!'' A trifle
over the top? Perhaps. But it's my tactic for coping with that sinking
feeling. I manage to distract myself from the bubbling panic over my
gaffe by concentrating on composing a Stephen King scenario, mentally
typing a death list.
The weirdest thing about the most embarrassing incident is that no
matter how much you want to hush it up at the time you will inevitably
eventually turn it into a dinner-party anecdote, fulfilling that ''och,
you'll laugh about it later'' fatalism. Well you lot do.
Personally, I keep my truly terrible faux pas firmly under mental lock
and key -- 10 vodkas and the hounds of hell could not extract the
details of one shocker which still makes me shudder -- but over the past
week, gathering details of embarrassing incidents from mates, I've been
astonished by how candid people can be. Most people I've quizzed have
happily spilled the most self-deprecating stories, some of which could
only be printed in the kind of publication which is handed to you in a
brown paper bag.
Tamer tales include the mate who visited his girlfriend's parents for
the first time and trod dog dirt all the way through their house;
gallantly offering a seat on the bus to a women who wasn't pregnant but
fat; raising Cain at a restaurant over a misplaced booking only to
realise that it was made with the restaurant next door; and answering
the telephone with the Freudian slip of a greeting -- ''bless me father
for I have sinned''.
I remember trailing toilet roll from the heel of a stiletto as I made
a supposedly sophisticated entrance on to a dance floor, but I was
bested by ''Fiona'' (''use my real name and I'll slit your throat'') who
walked into a job interview with her long floaty skirt tucked into the
back of her knickers. That was almost as bad as the girl who drafted her
parents in to help her move house; when ma and pa lifted the mattress
off her bed they found four silk scarves, tied to each bedpost. Explain
that one away.
Countless tales of embarrassment over cases of mistaken identity came
up which I couldn't relate to; when I raced down a street calling after
a friend, only to realise that it wasn't her when I caught up, I simply
carried on running down the street shouting ''Susan! Wait, Susan!'' Mind
you, the rest of the street was empty at the time so it wasn't the most
graceful of recoveries.
Embarrassment is the most potent of emotions. When the philosopher
Bertrand Russell wrote his memoirs he could recall various dramatic
incidents but he noted that the only emotions he could instantly
recapture related to those occasions when he was embarrassed.
I can certainly still vividly remember the awful mixture of
humiliation and rage I felt when someone pulled a tiny wooden chair out
from under me at my toddlers' playgroup, and I fell flat on the floor,
feet in the air, with a bruised bum and a bruised ego. I was only four,
but that's when I first felt that aforementioned flicker of planning a
vendetta. Well, some incidents can damage you for life.
Age and experience inure us to embarrassments, but when you're young
the most trivial of traumas has you feigning tonsillitis to escape your
classmates' sneers. Everyone, but everyone, recalls burning with shame
when they accidentally called their teacher ''mum'', but a friend who,
old enough to know better, so addressed his university lecturer simply
had a fit of giggles about it.
School teachers have to cultivate particularly thick skin to survive.
During my school's annual swimming gala the young, pretty PE teacher
caused a major commotion when her bikini top fell off during the novelty
raft race -- at the precise moment when the school's chaplain was
helping to haul her out of the water.
The resultant roars from spectating brats almost triggered the Richter
scale and we all assumed she would have to resign rather than face the
school the next day but there she was, cool as a cucumber, ignoring the
sniggers. When the school magazine revived the scandal by pooling
embarrassing moments from staff she proved her equanimity with the
succinct submission: ''PING!''
PEOPLE in the public eye have to be similarly resilient to
mortification. George Bush was confident enough not to worry a whit over
puking in public in Japan, while Fergie proved her neck was as brassy as
her hair by facing down the scandal caused when she frolicked topless
and was snapped having her toes sucked by her financial adviser.
It probably didn't take Princess Di long to get over the public shame
of fluffing her future hubby's name at a wedding ceremony witnessed by
millions but I can't imagine how she coped with the front-page splash of
her all sweaty in the gym. If someone circulated pics of me in the gym
I'd change continent and identity.
Perhaps I'm just too easily shamed, but go on, admit it, I bet you too
sneak through your photos when you pick them up from the chemist,
ripping up the most embarrassing shots. You do, don't you? Don't you?

OPPOSITIONIST. An unlovely word yet an honourable one. The child who
noted the emperor's want of underwear was an oppositionist. Zola, too,
would have passed muster, as might the pre-war Churchill, changing
parties like trains.
Without summoning too many ghosts to Labour's feast you could even say
Keir Hardie was an oppositionist. Once upon a time there was a lot of it
about.
Blair's new party might not be Stalinist -- in Joe's day sound-bites
could have your leg off -- but it has the language down pat.
''Oppositionalism'' is the charge laid against Liz Davies, the
candidate chosen by the Leeds North-east constituency party and rejected
by Labour's national executive. It means, as best as anyone can
establish, that she has a habit of disagreeing with people. Obviously
this is not what socialism is about.
Yet so complete has Labour's transformation been that even certain
Islington barristers are deemed suspect now. New Labour, a party so
intellectually confident it lives in fear of a handful of bargain
basement Trots and a magazine few people had heard of a fortnight ago,
has its image to think of.
For the sake of that chimera it overturned one-member one-vote. One
hundred and sixty seven people in Leeds voted for Davies; 17 on Labour's
national executive refused to endorse her. The NEC could find no fault
with the constituency party's procedures, nor was it able to prove that
the candidate had been a member of an entryist organisation. Claims that
she had been coy about her stand against the poll tax -- quite a loyalty
test, that one -- were rebutted convincingly.
At worst, she twice broke ranks as an Islington councillor -- a fact
that rendered Clare Short's apologia for the NEC yesterday piquant, to
say the least, given her own talent for getting herself sacked for
speaking her mind. After all, defiance of the whips is unknown in Labour
history, with the exceptions, trivial and best forgotten, of Bevan,
Wilson, Foot, Kinnock -- and Clare Short.
The real crime of Ms Davies, it seems, was an association with Labour
Briefing, one of the many half-written and widely-unread journals once
popular on the left. Interestingly, this amusing sheet attacked Short a
while back for, allegedly, trimming. Hilariously, she hit back yesterday
by claiming it is more dangerous to Labour than the Tory tabloids.
YET what do we really have here? The charge against Davies, upheld by
all those undemocratic but useful unions, is that she is ''unreliable'',
whatever that implies for the rights of conscience, and that, as another
party leader might once have said, she is not ''one of us''. Suffice it
to say the hardened subversive was reduced to tears by her compassionate
colleagues yesterday.
But fair enough. Labour is entitled to be anything it chooses to be,
to indulge in any witch-hunt it fancies, and to welcome back any number
of former SDP stalwarts whose reliability is, naturally, beyond
question. If the party wishes to purge itself of people liable to
criticise the leadership, that is the party's affair. Such was the style
during the time of Hugh Gaitskell, and history records how wonderfully
successful Labour was in those years.
There is, however, a deeper debate, albeit one not to Blair's taste.
What do we now mean by ''left''? Where, in the narrowing spectrum of
British political life, is the left located? Or are we to infer from the
Davies affair that the left, even in the broad sense of the word, is now
beyond the pale? If so, several dozen Labour MPs had better check their
pension plans. By the heady standards of the Militant debates of the
80s, Liz Davies is a lightweight and a moderate. She probably wants to
tax and spend. The cutting of nursery provision in Islington troubles
her. She doubts that economic justice will arrive through a fiddling of
the petty cash, ''partnership'' with BT, and suchlike. Hard-line
fundamentalist stuff.
But Labour, off down the yellow-brick information superhighway, has
said there is no room in the party for the likes of her. There is to be
neither oppositionalism nor opposition. The left is dissolved,
airbrushed from the picture, by the block vote of the leader's office.
To one who carries no card, for good journalistic reasons, but who
once saw no other real hope than Labour and the movement it embodied,
this is a melancholy thought. It is as though a line has been drawn
under the experience of generations, as though backs, if not coats, have
been turned on everything that once mattered, and still matters. A party
infested with minds so small will never achieve anything big.
So take the Labour Party, Mr Blair. You're welcome to it, whatever it
is.

FORGET Paris. Ignore any other centre of population which you may
associate with fine food. ''Bellshill is the gourmet capital of the
world,'' says chef John Higgins, who is slightly biased since he comes
from this corner of the dark county.
Mr Higgins is now a high-flying person at The King Edward restaurant
in Toronto, Canada, where he is director of food and beverages. He
features in a photographic exhibition which opens at the weekend in the
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
The exhibition is called Ex Patria and consists of snaps of 40 Scots
currently living and working in Canada. The photies were taken by Rosie
Donovan, herself a Glasgow West End exile now living in London, Ontario.
As well as posing for the pictures, the subjects talk about their
lives and their Scottishness. Mr Higgins, the Bellshill gourmet, says:
''The only thing I ever wanted to be in life was a chef, so I went to
Motherwell Technical College.'' Despite these humble beginnings, Mr
Higgins rose to be a chef at Gleneagles and thence cooked for Her
Majesty at her many residences.
''The only time I ever had food sent back was when I worked at the
Palace. They shoot rabbits and hares on the estates to feed the corgis.
You dice the meat up nicely and serve rice with it.''
Chef Higgins thought this was a bit of a waste of time, put the meat
through a mincer, and served it up looking like dog meat. ''It looked
all right but, needless to say, the Queen sent it back.'' Nothing too
good for Her little doggies.
Now ensconced in Toronto and catering for humans, he says of his
nationality: ''I'm very proud of my Scottish heritage. It's important.
People always expect the chef to be Italian, German, Swiss, or French
but never Scottish. Whenever they find out that the chef is Scottish
they say, 'They can't cook in Scotland'.''
No expense spared
DEPT of Amazing Things the BBC Does with Our Licence Fees, Part 2: BBC
Scotland news department, having hired the Pinkerton detective agency
not to find Brandon Lee, finally secured an interview with the famous
Bearsden schoolboy.
The half-hour chat with frontperson Jackie Bird is to be transmitted
tonight. To set the right mood, Ms Bird and her subject were despatched
by limo to the Kilfinnan Hotel near Tighnabruich. In the quietness of
this Argyll setting the two would have the opportunity, in the words of
a senior BBC Scotland news person, ''to bond''.
Mindcurdling
THERE is a touch of cheese mania going on in Glasgow's West End. This
is down to the recent opening of a cheesemonger's, the kind of shop we
thought only existed in Monty Python sketches.
But no, Mr Iain Mellis is now mongering a wide range of cheeses -- or,
as he calls it, ''ripening and selling a wide range of artesan and farm
cheeses''. His move to Glasgow follows a period of successful
cheesemongering in Edinburgh.
Mr Mellis, who has been a cheesemaker in Orkney and Cheshire, has
produced a tasteful catalogue which enables his customers to talk
knowledgeably on the subject of real cheese. Our favourite is his
description of the Irish Durrus cheese which has an ''almost sweet
chocolate flavour, full of hidden secrets, sweet apples and pears, and
even some say strawberries''.
We can imagine conversations such as: ''And did you know, Fiona, that
this Double Gloucester from Abbey Farm in Hawkstone, Shropshire, is
sprayed with a jet of steam for an hour in the storeroom every day to
simulate the atmosphere of a dark, damp cave?''
''No, I didn't, Senga. Another glass of Asda Bulgarian chardonnay? It
goes very well with this Irish Gouda made by Dutch restaurateurs Helen
and Dick Willems at Macroom in County Cork. It says here in the brochure
that its darker, richer flesh is deliciously, almost shockingly, fruity.
I think I might give it to Wullie in his pieces tomorrow.''
All at sea
THE Scottish Sunday Express continues to live up to its reputation as
a great English newspaper. The puzzle page in the colour magazine last
weekend asked junior readers to name the middle initial of ''Robert
Stephenson, the author of Treasure Island''.
Sanctuary from
the church
SCOTTISH publishers Mainstream have ruffled a few feathers in the
Republic of Ireland with a book detailing the secret married life of one
of that country's best-known Catholic priests.
Secret Love -- My Life with Father Michael Cleary is the story of
Paula Hamilton who appeared to live with the priest as his housekeeper.
But, according to her tale, Father Cleary actually went through a form
of marriage ritual with her when she was aged 17 and was the father of
two of her three children.
These revelations came as something of a blow to the Irish Catholics
who regarded Father Cleary as something of an icon. Not only was he a
priest but an entertainer, radio presenter, and warm-up act for the Pope
during his visit to Ireland.
Ms Hamilton's book contains some quite shocking detail. How she was
raped by a trainee priest and how she found her husband-priest in bed
with another woman.
Unsurprisingly, the Catholic church in Ireland is not too happy with
the book, which is now in the Republic's best-sellers list.
The church tried but failed to persuade RTE, the national broadcasting
corporation, that it would not be a good idea to feature interviews with
Ms Hamilton on its channels. The producers of the Kenny Live Show felt
it necessary to hire three armed bodyguards when she turned up to appear
on the programme.

Mike Dailly examines how a House of Lords judgment could let local
authorities wash their hands of homeless families, leaving them to fend
for themselves
WIDELY held beliefs were shattered earlier this year when the House of
Lords delivered a judgment on a case that left a chasm in the heart of
homeless people's rights.
According to the Lords, homeless families were not, and never had
been, entitled to permanent accommodation.
It seems that judges, academics, solicitors, and advisers had never
got it right. On July 6, 1995 the dream was apparently broken.
The case has surprised many, not least the Department of the
Environment who were effectively upstaged by a decision as controversial
as their own Housing Bill. Consequently, many lawyers are now arguing
that drastic measures in the current English Bill are unnecessary.
As a result of the judgment local authorities can now fully discharge
their duties to the homeless by arranging for private-sector lets, or by
placing applicants in hostel or bed-and-breakfast accommodation
indefinitely.
Fallout from the judgment has still to come, but the effect of the
case is that if a homeless person gives up temporary accommodation they
can be deemed intentionally homeless. In practice, this would mean no
local authority had a duty to house them.
So, the homeless have Hobson's choice -- they can either like their
temporary accommodation or lump it. This reflects the Lords' view that
the law is designed to provide them with ''a lifeline of last resort;
not to enable them to make inroads into the local authority's waiting
list of applicants for housing''.
Other problems are thrown up. For example, if a homeless family is
given a six-month short-assured tenancy, what happens when the private
landlord wants his property back? The House of Lords judgment can be
construed as meaning that such people will have to reapply as homeless
-- again and again.
More worrying still is the potential impact of controversial changes
to housing benefit, set to come into force on January 2, 1996. New
regulations will mean councils no longer have to pay benefit up to the
reasonable market rent. Any rent above the ''local reference rent''
figure will not be paid in full.
Imagine then if homeless families are provided with private-sector
lets. The rent is over the new lower limit and the council refuses to
pay all of it. The family incurs rent arrears and is evicted. The
result? You have families who are deemed intentionally homeless and are
now on their own.
It is no secret that the Government wants to house more homeless
households in the private-rented sector: the current English housing
White Paper spells it out.
Those who indulge in scapegoating might think we have a great way to
get rid of homeless queue jumpers once and for all. But these families
will never disappear. The Government and local authorities cannot shirk
their social responsibilities.
It is important to notice that these problems are not the fault of the
House of Lords. Anyone who reads the full judgment will appreciate that
the Lords were, for the most part, interpreting statutory law with great
clarity. So-called ''legal rights'' had in fact been based upon pillars
of sand -- a belief of what the law should be rather than what it was.
If something is repeated long enough it can be believed.
The real solution to problems thrown up by judgment is simple. So much
of housing law relies upon local authorities exercising their discretion
reasonably and properly. In Scotland, this is achieved by a good
understanding of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 and the Scottish Office
Code of Guidance on Homelessness.
At present, many Scottish local authorities have a shocking disregard
of the law on homelessness. It is fair to say that certain Scottish
councils are happy to ride roughshod over Scottish Office guidance or
commonsense.
To take a few examples: Kirkcaldy District Council have stated that
they do not consider, as a matter of policy, that non-domestic violence
is a reason for giving up accommodation. So, if an applicant had been
struck with a machete by a neighbour this would be no reason to give up
the tenancy. Yet the law simply provides that an applicant should not be
deemed intentionally homeless ''if it is not reasonable'' for them to
continue to occupy.
Bearsden and Milngavie District Council have advised an applicant that
they must spend a fixed period in a homeless hostel before they will be
considered for a council tenancy. In effect, an apprenticeship in
temporary accommodation must be served.
Glasgow District Council local housing officers appear to take ''legal
advice'' from the Hamish Allan Institute -- a staging post for the
homeless in Glasgow. Applicants with families who are deemed
intentionally homeless are often told they are only entitled to seven
days bed and breakfast. The Scottish Office Code of Guidance advises 28
days as a minimum.
The catalogue of blunders made by certain Scottish local authorities
goes on and on. What is needed is proper training for staff and a
consistent, fair and reasonable approach by all authorities.
Councils exercise their discretion for and on behalf of the community.
Part of that community are, of course, homeless families and vulnerable
adults. It is hoped that Scottish local authorities will not use the
House of Lords decision to the detriment of homeless people.

Skopje
MACEDONIAN President Kiro Gligorov underwent surgery today after an
assassination attempt in Skopje and his life is not in danger, a senior
Macedonian official said.
''All necessary surgical measures have been undertaken and at this
moment the president's life is not in danger,'' Macedonian parliament
speaker Stojan Andov told reporters.
It was the first official statement on Gligorov's condition since he
was wounded in a car bomb attack which killed his driver.
Diplomatic reports reaching Paris said Gligorov was in a critical
condition with serious head injuries including a fractured skull.
The Macedonian radio reports also spoke of head injuries but added
that Gligorov was conscious and talked to doctors treating him.
There was no medical bulletin from the government several hours after
the explosion in a central Skopje street as the president drove to his
office in the national parliament.
Gligorov's astute political leadership has been crucial to Macedonia's
peaceful transition to independence since leaving Yugoslavia in 1991.
It was alone among the four secessionist republics to escape war but
has been plagued by disputes with neighbouring Greece, Serbia and
Albania.
The country has been singled out for diplomatic and military
protection by the United States which has been anxious to ensure the
Bosnian war does not spread there.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but
police arrested two men who tried to flee the scene by car.
The government sealed the country's borders as opposition parties
condemned what they said was an attempt to destabilise Macedonia.
The bomb, triggered by remote control, exploded in a parked car
outside the Bristol Hotel about 250 yards from the parliament and
seriously wounded three bystanders.
Gligorov's driver, Aleksander Spirovski, died instantly from massive
head injuries from the blast.
''I heard a strong explosion and saw smoke,'' an eyewitness said.
''Glass started falling from all sides and I could hear lots of
screaming.''
The car in which the explosive charge was placed was completely
destroyed.
Gligorov's wife and family and members of the government went to his
bedside and an anxious crowd gathered outside the hospital waiting for
news of the president whose personal popularity in the country is high.
The attack coincided with talks in Athens between Greek and Macedonian
diplomats on the implementation of an agreement to normalise relations
between the two countries after a long dispute over the former Yugoslav
republic's right to use the name Macedonia.
Greece said the name implied a territorial claim to its own northern
province of Macedonia.
The talks went ahead and a Greek government spokesman told reporters:
''We don't know whether the murder attempt had anything to do with the
on-going talks but, thank God, Mr Gligorov is alive. We know he was
facing opposition at home for his efforts to normalise relations with
Athens.''
Since gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, Macedonia has also
been beset by troubled relations with its large ethnic Albanian minority
who have been pushing for improved national rights.
The United States sent troops to join UN peacekeepers deployed in
Macedonia to ensure that the war in Bosnia did not spread there in a
widening of the conflict to other parts of the Balkans.
Gligorov met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic near Belgrade
yesterday.
Milosevic's office indicated later that an end to the dispute between
Greece and Macedonia could pave the way to mutual recognition between
rump Yugoslavia and Macedonia.
Gligorov had been due to address the UN General Assembly later this
week.--Reuter.

Sarajevo
PEACE prospects in former Yugoslavia faced bloody new challenges today
when Bosnian government troops bombarded Serb forces around Sarajevo and
a car bomb almost killed the president of Macedonia.
Shuttle diplomacy by US envoy Richard Holbrooke and a tentative step
towards a Serb-Croat peace deal for the Eastern Slavonia region in
Croatia were overshadowed by the bloodshed.
The Bosnian government army opened fire with four heavy weapons inside
the 12[1/2]-mile exclusion zone around Sarajevo at Serb positions,
drawing a harsh rebuke from UN peacekeepers.
The Serbs were forced to pull their heavy weapons from the exclusion
zone in September in exchange for a halt to Nato air strikes against
them.
The Muslim-led government agreed not to use its own heavy weapons to
attack the Serbs from inside the zone, a pledge the UN said had been
violated today.
The assassination attempt on Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov raised
fears instability and violence could spread to the southern Balkans.
In northwest Bosnia, the Serbs made significant battlefield gains,
capturing villages around the town of Kljuc in territory taken by
government and Croat forces last month.
Serb military authorities said government units were retreating ''in
general chaos'' and said the Serb defence lines were firm. Fighting was
continuing.
In Croatia, the Zagreb government and Serb insurgents occupying its
eastern Slavonia region agreed on a preliminary set of ''guiding
principles'' aimed at settling their dispute, UN envoy Thorvald
Stoltenberg said.
Stoltenberg and Peter Galbraith, the US ambasasador to Croatia,
mediated at the talks in Erdut between Croatian envoys and leaders of
local Serbs who have held the area since 1991.--Reuter.

AN American electronics company is to build a factory in Fife,
creating 500 jobs in one of Scotland's major unemployment blackspot, it
was announced yesterday.
Lexmark International's #26m development will be sited near the Rosyth
naval base and dockyard, where thousands of jobs have been lost over the
past few years.
The deal to bring the US multi-national to Scotland was finalised
after a private visit by Scottish Office Industry Minister George Kynoch
to its Kentucky headquarters last week, where he made a formal offer of
Regional Selective Assistance to company chiefs.
A number of other European countries, which the company declined to
name, had competed with Scotland for the prestigious contract.
Dr Paul Curlander, executive vice-president of operations for Lexmark,
said his company has set a four-year timetable for creating the jobs,
70% of which will be on the assembly line. The remainder will be mainly
engineering, technical, and management positions.
He said the Fife factory will produce colour and monochrome cartridges
for the company's range of ink jet printers, at a 90,000sq ft factory,
to be built on former Ministry of Defence land.
Dr Curlander added: ''Last year was our best ever and we are keen to
make the most of the momentum that has been created, by establishing the
new plant in Fife to support our ongoing activity in Europe.''
He said the availability of skilled labour and support from local
agencies were two of the main reasons for coming to Scotland.
Manufacturing will begin on site in April next year and the company has
not ruled out further job opportunities once production begins.
The announcement coincides with another by the company relating to the
expansion of its Kentucky facility and a search for another US site.
Deputy provost of Dunfermline District Council, Ms Avril Hughes, said
she was delighted by the jobs boost but said it had to be taken in
context and compared with the amount of job losses in the area over the
past few years.
Councillor Hughes said: ''The decision by Lexmark to set up here is
good news but you have to look at what has been happening in south Fife
over the past few years.
''In the last six or seven years, there have been around 7000 jobs
lost in the defence industry in south Fife. The announcement today is
obviously good news but must be looked at in the light of those job
losses. We will keep fighting to make sure many more much-needed jobs
come to the area.''
Mr Kynoch described the jobs announcement as ''excellent news both for
Fife and for Scotland'', which confirmed the country's international
reputation as an excellent location for company's to serve European
markets.
He said the vote of confidence in the area as a manufacturing base
added to recent successful efforts by the Government and other agencies
to attract new jobs and investment to the area.
He highlighted a number of recent job announcements in Fife, including
Californian company Solectron, which is creating 200 jobs at a #10m
expansion of its Dunfermline plant; BSkyB which has set up a #10m
subscriber management centre, and will create 1000 full-time jobs by the
year 2000; Birkbys Plastics, which is creating 100 jobs over three years
at Glenrothes; and Canon, which announced a #10m investment and 220 new
jobs by the end of next year at its Glenrothes factory.
Mr Robert MacKenzie, chief executive of Fife Enterprise, described the
development as one of national significance which was a substantial
milestone in the regeneration of the Fife economy.
The factory contractor, Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd, believes
around 200 will be employed building the Lexmark factory.

Colombo
THE Sri Lankan army said its troops had killed at least 200 Tamil
Tiger rebels as heavy fighting raged for a third day today on the
northern Jaffna peninsula.
Another 30 guerrillas belonging to the Sea Tiger squad were killed
last night in an abortive rebel attack off the eastern coast, a military
communique added. Rebel radio reported 50,000 residents had been left
homeless by the intense fighting.
Statements by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) put the
rebel casualty toll lower.
Diplomats said the latest upsurge in the conflict could be the start
of a widely expected all-out government offensive on the northern
stronghold of Tamil separatists. But they added that a continuous
drizzle apparently presaging the onset of October monsoons may put this
in doubt.
Army communiques estimated at least 200 LTTE cadres were killed by
troops backed by tanks and artillery after the guerrillas launched a
counter-offensive against government forces in Jaffna at midnight
yesterday.
The army said it lost nearly 40 people, 15 of them in the Sea Tiger
attack on a naval vessel off the eastern port town of Mullaitivu.
A total of 51 LTTE cadres were killed on Sunday after government
troops launched an operation code-named Thunder Strike at daybreak, an
army communique said, adding that a clutch of towns around Achchuveli
were captured.
It said the captured towns were in a radius of 13 miles southeast of
the government forces' Palaly airbase headquarters.
Rebel Tiger Radio, monitored in the frontline government-controlled
town of Vavuniya, reported tonight that 150 LTTE cadres had been killed.
It was not clear whether the report referred to today's fighting or to
all the three days of the latest clashes.
An LTTE statement faxed to Reuters from its London office gave much
lower figures.
''The LTTE have lost eight fighters including two captains in the
action so far,'' the Tiger statement said. It confirmed that heavy
fighting was raging in the Jaffna war zone.
An LTTE official in London told Reuters in Colombo that he would check
out the discrepancy in the statements. He insisted the London version
was correct.
The army said troops had recovered the bodies of at least 144 rebels
killed in today's action. .--Reuter.

INVERNESS, Nairn, and Lochaber MP Sir Russell Johnston yesterday
called on the chief executive and the board of the Highland Communities
NHS Trust to consider resigning because of their handling of a projected
budget deficit.
Sir Russell said it was absurd that they should consider closing one
of four wards in the main geriatric hospital in Inverness or paying off
45 people to meet the #1.8m deficit, #1m of which had been due to a
mistake during the trust's original negotations with Highland Health
Board.
''They are responsible for this mistake. You can't put the whole blame
on to the accountant who has already been sacked for other reasons. I
don't think that is good enough,'' he declared.
''You have a very considerable and reasonably paid managerial
structure whose job it is to ensure that mistakes like this do not
happen. They have failed in doing that and they are now saying we are
terribly sorry about all this but as a consequence we have to close a
ward, we have to sack 45 people but we are staying in post. They should
all very seriously consider resigning.''

Margaret Vaughan reports on the crumbling crusade of Arthur Scargill
which has reduced him from King Coal to a forlorn King Canute
PEEVISH under his spun-sugar barnet, pink and glowering, Our Arthur
tried. Oh how he tried. But the man who has lost most of his members,
most of his hair, and most of his influence in the Labour movement,
still couldn't concede defeat. And that is part of his problem. Tactics
never were his forte.
The miners' leader who once gave the political lexicon a new word --
to Scargill, meaning to build up a monumental pile of impossible
demands, fix it in place with a complicated system of rhetorical
scaffolding and webs of deceit, then spray it with lacquer -- showed
once more, and perhaps for the last time, his misplaced sense of
destiny.
The muted clapping which greeted his lonely walk to the rostrum in
Brighton yesterday to urge conference to reject the new Clause Four was
symbolic of his standing in the movement.
When he became president of the NUM in 1983, there were 250,000
miners. Now the NUM affiliates to the TUC with 11,000 members. He polled
880,000 votes in the elections in the trade union section of Labour's
NEC -- down from more than one million last year. He finished well down
the list of candidates.
Later, in a radio interview, after his conference stalk, he spoke of
his disillusion with the party which, he pouted, had broken all links
with socialism.
He didn't know how much longer he would stay in the party in which
many people had no concept of what was required to change society from a
capitalist system to a socialist one. Ouch! But wait.
Can this be the same man who, in 1974, told an interviewer that
militant trade unionism on its own could become a dynamo to change
society? Who was openly cynical of the role of MPs and the political
process in favour of things that could be done through trade unions?
Who, in the New Left Review, in 1975, describing his move from
membership of the Young Communist League to the activism of the miners'
union said: ''I gradually began to be interested in the union itself
because it appeared to me that irrespective of what I did politically .
. . the real power lay either with the working classes or the ruling
classes.
''Now the working classes were obviously identified with the trade
union movement and not directly identified with the Labour Party, which
in my opinion had, and indeed still has, lost complete contact with the
basic problems of the movement and the rank and file.''
The disillusion, if it has set in, must have been a long time
astewing; well over 20 years it seems.
Norman Willis, who was general secretary of the TUC, used to sing, to
the tune of the Gay Gordons: ''Arthur Scargill walks on water.''
Yesterday it appeared Arthur had been washed up on to the far shores,
King Canute more than King Coal.
But then ordering the waves to recede might not seem such an
impossible task for a man who has led a life of posturing impossibilism.
The miners' leader blames the Labour party and the TUC for not giving
him adequate support during the great strike of 1983-84. But it was, as
the author of an unauthorised biography Scargill revealed, Scargill's
decision to keep Neil Kinnock and Len Murray at arms' length.
Solidarity, for Arthur, has always been a one-way ticket.
The miners' strike was an unmitigated disaster. Since 1985, more than
150 pits have closed and 100,000 men have lost their jobs. Scargill led
his members into ''non-negotiable'' battle without democratic
consultation. He split his union and alienated much of the trade union
movement by insisting that the strike was a quasi-revolutionary act. He
kept his members out, and their families suffering, long after it was
clear the strike was lost. And in the process he may have accelerated
the death of the industry.
It may be that in Mrs Thatcher he met his match. Scargill, in 1985,
underlined his belief that it was his duty to bring down a Conservative
government, whatever the views of the electorate.
But for Scargill, according to Paul Routledge, his biographer, it is
not not really a class war he wages. It is a personal war. His outlook
is built on conflict from which he believes he will emerge as both
winner and great wise leader.
''He thought he was the new Messiah,'' observed Emlyn Williams, his
rival on the left.
Scargill has been a member of the Labour Party for 30 years. He never
allowed his name to go forward to any of the constituencies where he
claims to have been offered safe seats. Once in Parliament he would have
to accept the Labour whip, the collective discipline of his party. It
was, by his own admission, his refusal to accept the discipline of the
party that led to his break with the Communist Party.
He claimed to have read Marx as a schoolboy. Yet, according to those
closest to him, there was no evidence of a coherently thought out
position. Rather, those pressed to pin him down describe a crude form of
syndicalism. He has described himself at various times as a class
warrior and a disillusioned ex-communist.
He has described himself as a democratic Marxist who wanted to see
Tony Benn as Prime Minister, and Roy Jenkins and Shirley Williams thrown
out of the Labour Party.
In his diaries Benn noted that Scargill was ''a bright guy and I like
him. The point is how, if we get a working majority in the election, we
can use that analysis to try to carry through some changes within the
party, particularly in its internal democracy''.
This would be around the time that the essential transformation of
Anthony Wedgewood Benn from a Wilsonian technocrat into Tony Benn the
socialist took place. Benn became established in the networks of the
Labour movement as the leading proponent of a new kind of radicalism.
The distinction was beginning to be drawn between the hard left,
represented by Benn and people like Scargill, and the soft left,
including Foot and Castle.
Thus Arthur Scargill, son of a miner, union activist, for whom self
doubt was unthinkable, became a political force.
He believed the revolution would come about in one of two ways: either
the left would win leadership of the unions then win the Labour Party
through commitment to conference policies to the positions necessary to
change society, or a strike would come about which would lead to the
downfall of a Tory Government.
Whichever route was taken, the outcome would be the same, the
immediate implementation of Clause Four.
He believed that such change could happen ''very swiftly''. His
analysis proved to be, like his judgment, flawed.
From the crusade which began in a small pit village home as a humble
activist in a big union, he ends it in a big house as the leader of a
small union on the brink of extinction.

The Thin Red Line is being stretched to breaking point, reports Ian
Bruce
FIVE years of Treasury pruning and Defence Ministry fine-tuning was
supposed to make the British Army ''lean and mean''. Instead, the
unsightly scramble to claw back cash has created a Thin Red Line
stretched to breaking point and looking decidedly threadbare.
If Argentina re-invaded the Falklands tomorrow, Britain would be
unable to patch together a force to retake the islands. Thanks to the
Treasury, 1982 was a one-off.
A Gulf War-level deployment would be impossible without three months'
notice and the stripping of all military assets worldwide. There were
only three operational Challenger tanks left in Germany last time
around. Next time there might not even be crews to man them.
The Army is supposed to have stabilised at 41 infantry battalions. But
even in an era of high unemployment, it is 1200 men short this year of
its authorised complement. Effectively, that means it is two battalions
short of a full deck.
Every battalion, with the exception of the Gurkhas, is
under-recruited. The emergency measure now to be adopted is the offer of
an enlistment bonus of up to #1400 for those willing to serve Queen and
country for an extra year. It is a measure born of predicted
desperation.
Even in Scotland, which traditionally provides 11% of the armed
services' manpower from a population representing 9% of the United
Kingdom population, times are hard. The last ''Jock'' battalion
dispatched for a tour of duty in Bosnia, the Royal Highland Fusiliers,
had to adopt more than 100 men from other Scottish units to make up the
shortfall in operational wartime numbers.
Until last year, every battalion sent to Northern Ireland had to be
beefed up by men from another unit. At one crazy stage of the numbers
game, a rifle company from a Scottish regiment destined for amalgamation
had to be provided to flesh out an English battalion in the province
that had just escaped the Treasury axe.
The Scottish Division -- now six battalions strong -- called itself
the Rent-A-Jock mob. The colonels of some regiments frequently found
themselves in command of a headquarters group and a lot of empty
barracks blocks for four to six months at a time when they should have
been in charge of 750 fighting soldiers.
Their rifle companies were on loan. It was not uncommon for men to
find themselves spending nine months away from their wives and families
because of emergency tours in Ireland and elsewhere. It was a recipe for
poor morale and short marriages.
Worse, the redundancy packages on offer under the Treasury-inspired
Options for Change plan were designed to strip away the Army's middle
management, the experienced majors, captains, and senior sergeants and
corporals who actually make the whole hidebound organisation tick on
command at times of crisis.
It was a policy based purely on cost. A good sergeant earns more than
#18,000 a year, not including allowances. He is a relatively expensive
item, but indispensable to the smooth running of a military formation.
They don't have sergeants in the Treasury, more's the pity.
Men will follow a sergeant out of loyalty and confidence in his
ability to do the job and keep them alive. They follow officers, it is
said, principally out of a sense of morbid curiosity.
When the senior NCOs voted with their feet, the Army was left with the
worst possible option for change. It had experienced senior officers at
one end of the scale, and inexperienced squaddies at the other. It was
not designed to optimise efficiency or combat-readiness. It is a tribute
to the Army's make-do-and-mend spirit that a major disaster has not
occurred to date.
But even the most senior officers have made illogical decisions in the
post-Cold War years. More than 23,000 British troops equipped with
state-of-the-art tanks are still stationed in Germany, braced and
trained to repel the Soviet hordes who will now never darken the North
German plain. It is a prime example of the ancient British tradition of
gearing up to fight the last war instead of preparing for the next.
The fundamental problem for the Army is that if senior, career
soldiers are leaving, then how does it convince teenagers that they have
a future and a home in the service? Salami-slicing defence budgets and
amalgamating or disbanding regiments is not recommended. Treasury take
note.

THE education convener of the shadow South Ayrshire Council has
launched a scathing attack on Scottish Office plans for a voucher system
to provide pre-school education.
Councillor Elaine Murray has called the scheme a ''shameless
vote-buying exercise'' and has urged parents to look closely at the
ramifications before becoming involved.
She said: ''If the Government is serious in its desire to increase the
provision of pre-five education, they would not be cutting #39m from
local government budgets but would be allocating the additional #31m new
money to local government for increased provision.''
The councillor, who represents Ayr South on Strathclyde Regional
Council, disclosed that the new unitary authority will inherit a 7%
underprovision in pre-school education in the district.
There is, however, a manifesto commitment from the incoming Labour
administration to rectify this situation and, for this reason, they will
take part in the pilot voucher project ''with the utmost reluctance''.
Councillor Murray, speaking on the eve of the closing date for
consultation, remained concerned that the major benefit of the voucher
scheme would be in more affluent areas where private provision is higher
and that areas of deprivation would suffer as councils struggled to
afford nursery places on limited budgets.
The council has agreed, despite serious reservations, to discuss the
scheme with the Scottish Office in a bid to gain significant
improvements.
The Government wants to provide an #1100 grant for each child in their
pre-school year towards the purchase of education. Local authorities
hope that parents will want to use the voucher scheme, if it is
introduced, to buy their services.

A STATE-of-the-art rapid response sports medicine centre was launched
in Glasgow yesterday, in a bid to stop the flow of athletes who leave
the city because of lack of treatment facilities.
The centre, part of Caledonian University's faculty of health, the
largest in Europe, will offer specialist care by practitioners and
technicians from the departments of physiotherapy, podiatry, and
radiography.
Although Lothian has six such centres, the new unit will be only
Glasgow's second and the first to offer rapid access treatment.
Short-notice care will be offered to injured athletes -- the first of
which were treated on Monday -- who are sent by GPs or are
self-referred.

WHOEVER would have believed that a knee-length camel coat could become
a high fashion must-have? Yet fashion is a topsy-turvy little world of
arbitrary judgments, where sooner or later everything comes in for
reappraisal. Eras long dismissed as style-free zones are rehabilitated;
trends long considered humiliating aberations of taste are revived. And
even humpy old camel can become king for a season.
Fashion change may stimulate fashion business. But it is always easier
to gain customer acceptance for something slightly familiar than the
wholeheartedly innovative. It is little wonder, therefore, that fashion
settles for reappraisals of items long locked away in the archives of
style. It is a matter of dragging them out, dusting them down, and
looking at them in a new way.
And that is exactly what has happened with our friend, the camel coat.
It had become an ultimate expression of dull suburban taste -- so
serviceable, in Brodie-speak the veritable chrysanthemum of coats. But
now that fashion wants women to have something luxurious in fabric but
very simple in shape and structure, its humble charms have a regenerated
capacity for point-of-sale seduction.
Sometimes a camel coat is just exactly that -- a coat made from pure
camel hair. More usually, camel denotes nothing but the colour. Pure
cashmere retains a special cachet. Angorra and alpaca produce warm but
very lightweight cloths of a distinctive texture. But some of the finest
coat fabrics are combinations of such luxury yarns with wool,
guaranteeing a luxurious handle without compromising the durability.
A good coat can provide much more than one single winter's wear. And
in the Scottish climate, where a coat will always be a priority, it
makes sense not to compromise on quality. Consider it an investment.
Afraid of being mistaken for a suburban matron, when you are of course
a banner-raiser for the cutting edge of style? Try combining your new
camel coat with something a little unorthodox. Helmut Lang juxtaposes
camel with gleaming white to achieve a very new look. Here, we add a
touch of animal magic for a traffic-stopping effect. A girl can cause a
commotion in camel.

A DEDICATED unit at Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital has been expanded
because of an increase in the number of patients being referred by
doctors for day surgery.
Yesterday, the Scottish Health Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
officially
opened a #30,000 extension designed to carry out minor operations and
examinations.
In the first six months after the original day surgery unit opened in
1993, around 5000 patients were treated, 20% more than was originally
planned for. Last year, the unit dealt with 7000 patients. The extension
includes an operating room and an additional 11 beds.
Hospital chief executive David Sillito said GPs had become more
enthusiastic about the benefits of day surgery, with more than 50% of
operations now carried out in this manner.
The Health Minister added that day surgery units offered patients
greater choice and allowed hospitals to cut waiting lists.

THE biggest tax shake-up since the war is about to hit Britain and
there are fears that it could herald a ''hostile'' American-style tax
regime. Employers will have new burdens put on them and face tougher
penalties and deadlines if they fail to meet them.
This new system, due to come into operation in 18 months time, goes by
the name of Self-Assessment, which most professionals shorten to SA. The
public face of SA is the bowler-hatted cartoon character in the Inland
Revenue commercials, but the private face could be very different.
It is intended to be a simpler system but already the Inland Revenue
is working on its third design of form after earlier efforts confused
even the accountants. When self-employed taxpayers filled in the forms
during trials last year, more than half completed them wrongly or got
their tax bills wrong.
The President of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, Peter
Gravestock, this summer called the introduction of self-assessment
combined with the switch to taxing self-employed traders on their
current year's earnings, insltead of the previous year's, a ''recipe for
disaster.''
He said the 1996-97 transitional year would put such a strain on the
self-assessment system that it could collapse. He called on the taxmen
not to press ahead with plans to penalise taxpayers who miss the
September 30 deadline.
His successor, Gerry Hart, has called for a tax amnesty to allow
everyone to bring his or her affairs up to date before self-assessment
comes into force. He said it could bring in increased income for the
government.
This confusion is in spite of #25m being spent on advertising,
brochures and videos over three years. As part of the first #2.5m phase
of the campaign, two weeks television advertising was followed up by
four weeks of press ads. Information packs were sent to 90,000 tax
agents and to one million employers.
''The advent of self-assessment has been described as the greatest
change to the UK's tax system since the introduction of PAYE,'' says
John Whiting, head of personal tax at Price Waterhouse, and chairman of
the Chartered Institute of Taxation's Technical Committee.
''There is a parallel here for emplouers: both SA and PAYE are
primarily concerned with income tax and both put major burdens on
employers.''
A deeper concern, however, is how the new system will affect the
atmosphere of the tax regime. ''Up to now the British tax system has
been taxation by mutual acquiescence, where we are moving to a situation
where the obligation rests with the citizen,'' said Donald Adamson, a
tax partner with KPMG and himself a former tax inspector.
''It will have very hefty penalties. That's the system which operates
in the United States and it's coming here. It is a more hostile fiscal
environment.
''American tax is very complex and we are in danger of making out tax
complex as well. The legislation is becoming ever more complex. The
temptation is to write ever more complex law. People cannot understand
it.''
''We have not reached that point yet but we want to be very careful
not to fall into the same trap.''
Until now the taxpayer has sent in a tax return showing his income and
claiming any allowances he thinks he is entitled to. An inspector then
calculated his tax bill.
The principle of self-assessment is that the taxpayer should work out
his own tax bill and pay it to the Revenue. The taxman's role will
change from assessing tax to checking the taxpayer's assessment and
investigating suspected evaders.
Effectively the administrative burder for income tax is being shifted
from the taxman to the taxpayer. ''At the moment the obligation of
getting the tax right is split betweenthe taxpayer and the Revenue,''
said Adamson.
''The Revenue has said that too often this division of
responsibilities causes problems. But who is it causing problems for?
The Revenue. I think it is a major transference of responsibility on to
the shoulders of the public.''
It is expected to contribute to a deduction of up to 10,000 jobs in
the Inland Revenue. Even at a salary level of #10,000 that would save
the Government #100m a year.
If all the tax you are liable to is deducted at source, either through
PAYE or as with the bank interest, for example, you will notice little
change. Nine million people, however, will be faced with new-style tax
return -- when the Revenue has finished designing it -- from the 1996-97
tax year.
The new returns will have to be completed by the end of January after
the tax year ends, so the deadline for the first new-style tax returns
is January 31, 1998. It will still be possible to ask the Revenue to do
the calculation but if you do your tax return you will have to be in
four months earlier, by the end of September.
You will have to pay the tax without the Revenue reminding you, and
there will be three payment dates in the tax year: two for payments on
account and one for a final balancing account.
The payments on account will be due on January 31 while the tax year
is still running and July 31 after it ends. So the first payament under
the new system is due on January 31, 1997, a full year before the
new-style tax returns are due in.
Payments on account will usually be half your tax bill for the
previous year. When you have worked out your tax liability in your
self-assessment, you will see how much is still owing. Any final
balancing payments due must be paid by the next January 31.
Employers will have to give employees all the information they need
about their income and benefits. Every employer will be affected by new
responsibilities and will be liable to new penalties if they fail.
The Revenue says initially it will prefer to educate than to penalise
but if there is a serious delay, and especially if an employee cannot
submit his or her tax return on time because the employer was late with
the information, it fines offenders.
Providing the correct forms to employees late will be punishable by an
initial penalty of #300 and up to #60 for a day they are late. If the
forms declaring benefits to directors are incorrect, the penalty could
be up to #3,000 per employee.
There will be a penalty for late tax payments, at least 5% of the tax
still outstanding more than 28 days after it is due and another 5% on
top for any tax more than six months late. As an added incentive to
paying, interest will be charged on these surcharges if they are not
paid within 30 days.
To make matters worse, during the transitional year of 1996-97, a
mixture of the old and the new rules will apply. Very few people will
have to make payments on account.
The Revenue will now be able to investigate -- or audit -- any tax
return without having to give a good reason, though it must tell you
that it intends to do so within 12 months of the deadline for filing
your return.
It can ask for more information or to see documents to support your
self-assessment. The audit will not be over until the tax inspector says
it is over, unless you appeal to the Tax Commissioners.
''In the future we will get into a similar system to France and the US
where you have random tax audits,'' said Adamson. ''At the moment the
Revenue is not supposed to go on fishing trips and the Inland Revenue in
Scotland is very good at not doing so.
''But I think it will. It is going to be a quite different fiscal
system to the one we have had up to now. It will be a more antagonistic
tax world.''

More than #5,000m -- or #170 per second -- will be overpaid to the
British taxman this year, according to financial analysts who carried
out a three-month investigation, and this could be an under-estimate.
The investigation included an analysis of the Inland Revenue's own
Personal Income survey of 70,000 individual cases conducted for its own
internal purposes. This was augmented by a survey of 25,000 adults in
Britain.
According to the analysts, Mintel, who were commissioned by IFA
Promotion representing 15,000 independent financial advisers, 31 million
people in Britain -- or three out of four adults -- will this year waste
#5.4 billion in unnecessary tax payments.
The wasted money is equivalent ot 7% of all pesonal taxation collected
by the Inland Revenue this year. The money is made up of an estimated
#850m paid to the Revenue in error, #1.25 billion which could easily be
saved using more tax-efficient financial products, and #3.26 billion
which could be saved with more complex tax planning.
Tax avoidance is legal -- tax evasion is not. Most tax avoidance is
practised by those who can afford better advisers and who have more
choice in directing their money than those trapped in the straitjacket
of PAYE.
Yet ordinary people and their families are not totally helpless in the
face of the taxman. There are steps almost anyone can take to reduce the
tax bill.
For example, savers could be wasting as much as #1.32 billion a year
by paying tax on the bank and building society accounts. ''Interest and
dividends are taxed at source and too many people fail to reclaim these
deductions,'' said independent financial adviser Ken Murray, of Campbell
Smith Financial Services in Greenock.
Non-taxpayers should either reclaim the tax paid on their savings or,
better still, register to receive their interest gross by completing
Inland Revenue form IR85 and returning it to their bank or building
society.
Low-rate taxpayers can claim back the difference between their 20% tax
rate and the 25% which is automatically deducted from the interest on
their savings. They can also reclaim the tax paid on savings in previous
years.
Married couples waste money if they do not share assets, including
savings and shares, in a way that makes the most of their individual
annual tax allowances.
Some financial products, such as Tax Exempt Special Savings accounts
(TESSAs), Personal Equity Plans (PEPs) and some National Savings
investments, are taxi free if certain conditions are met.
A proper division of assets could save a married couple capital gains
tax when they sell assets. They should also make sure the index-link the
cost of acquisitions properly so that they do not pay capital gains tax
on inflation.
''Also it should be remembered that the tax relief on mortgage
interest is paid regardless of whether the mortgage holder is a taxpayer
or not,'' said Murray. ''This may be of interest to parents who are
assisting their children through further education by paying the
mortgage on a flat.
''Many employed non-taxpayers do not contribute to personal pensions
despite the fact that they can pay the premiums net of basic-rate income
tax. This effectively means that the Inland Revenue is pay a quarter of
the premium for them.
''If you happen to be employed by your partner, or are on very good
terms with your employer, it is possible to pay substantially more in
premium to a pension by using an Executive Pension Plan rather than a
Personal Pensio.'' (See Tax Saver 1).
Unions, some of whom have been looking for a new role since the
introduction of weighty legislation in the 1980s, could no more to help
members with tax advice, especially when negotiating pay deals.
For example a device known as ''salary sacrifice'' can acually
increase employees pensions without costing the workers of their
employees pensions without costing the workers of their employer a
penny. (See Tax Saver 2).
Another independent financial adviser, David Bates of Cairns Horne and
Co, companies should have an IFA on a retainer basis to advise
management and staff on financial matters.

independent advice.
Tax Saver 1
A man whose wife helps him in running his newsagent's restricts her
earnings to #58 a week so that she pays neither National Insurance nor
Income Tax. At her age if she contributed to a personal pension she
would be limited to paying in 205 of her income, or around #50 a month.
But by using an Executive Pension Plan, th business is able to
contribute #141.40 a month. These premiums have reduced her husband's
Income Tax and National Insurance liability by the same amount and the
plan will give her nearly three times the pension she would have had.
Tax Saver 2
A ''salary sacrifice'' can save employees money. One company-sponsored
personal pension scheme required employees to contribute 2% of earnings
while the employer contributed 4%. This was changed so that the
employees contribution was deducated before they received their pay.
This reduced the amount of National Insurance contributions both
employer and employee had to make. The employer then paid the combined
contribution together with the NI savings into the pension scheme. The
pension contribution rose by more than 10% while employees take-home pay
remained the same.

TOM has a job where he pays tax through PAYE, but he has other income
from consultancy work which he is paid gross. Under self-assessment, he
will pay tax in the following way.
He does not receive a reminder or an assessment from the Inland
Revenue, but he knows that the tax due on his consultancy work the
previous year was #400. Son on January 31, he pays the taxman #200.
On July 31, he pays the taxman another #200.
In between those dates, on May 31, Tam's employer gives him a form
P60, the year-end return showing the salary Tam has received and the tax
he has paid under PAYE for the tax year ending April 5.
Tam sits down and starts working out his self-assessment, which he
completes and sends in by the end of January. This shows he earned more
from consultancy work this year and he was liable to a total of #450 in
tax.
If Tam had a bad year and found his tax bill on the consultancy work
was only #350, he would receive a refund of #50 and if the refund came
after January 31 he would receive tax free interest on it, called a
repayment supplement.
If Tam had a really bad year, and it was clear he was going to be
liable to only #300 in tax, he could write to the Revenue claiming that
he should reduce his payments on account to #150 each.
If Tam did nothing about his tax and failed to make his first #200
payment on account on January 31, then by March 1, 28 days later, he
would not only owe #210 -- #200 plus 5% -- but interest on the #200 as
well.
By April 1 -- another 30 days later -- he would owe #210 plus interest
on the #200 from January 31 AND interest on the #10 from April 1.
By August 1, he would owe all that plus ANOTHER 5% surcharge, as well
as the second #200 payment on account if he missed it on July 31...and
so on.
If Tam was being really stupid and he did not tell the Revenue he was
due to pay tax on his extra earnings, there is a penalty of up to 100%
of the tax not paid by January 31.
There is also a fixed penalty of #100 if the return is late and
another #100 six months later if it is still late. The Revenue could
apply to the Commissioners for a penalty of #60 a day.
For an incorrect return the penalty could be up to 100% of the tax not
paid. If Tam failed to produce documents the Revenue had asked for, he
could be charged #50 plus #30 a day until the document is produced.
The daily penalty could be increased to #150 if the Commissioners give
the Revenue permission. Failing to retain records can cost #3000.

VALUE Added Tax last year brought the Government #47,329m, its biggest
earner after income tax at #62,391m and nearly three times the #17,341m
that came from corporation tax.
It has been one of the fastest spreading taxes, reaching areas outside
the European Union, such as Scandinavia, even before it reached Britain.
One reason is that, for all the complaints about the forms involved,
there is an inherent logic to it. Tax is paid on the value added between
transactions.
Because VAT-registered businesses can claim back VAT, it means that
tax is not paid on tax, as might happen with some forms of sales tax.
For governments there is the great advantage that traders and
companies are acting as unpaid tax collectors, calculating the amount of
VAT they have to chage, deducting the mount theyhave paid and sending
off a cheque to Customs and Excise.
Traders and companies who are too small to register for VAT cannot
claim back the VAT on equipment and materials they buy but if they are
selling to the public they have an effective 17.5% price advantage
because they do not charge VAT.
That price advantage, though, disappears if their customers are
businesses who can claim back VAT.

The Government is being blamed for the continuing slump in the homes
market, says Property Correspondent Stewart McIntosh
THEY messed it up, so they should fix it -- and soon. With the
political party season in full swing, builders and estate agents are
unanimous in blaming the politicians for the continuing gloom in the
property market.
Builders like Persimmon, CALA, Tarmac, Wimpey, and Beazer are queueing
up to throw bricks at a Government which, they believe, has allowed the
roof to fall in on the UK's housing sector. Reductions in mortgage
interest tax relief, this week's cuts in mortgage protection, and
fluctuating interest rates over the last few years have all affected
customer confidence, creating a sluggish and patchy sales pattern.
With both main parties limbering up for an election, the property
industry is hoping that the fiscal foundations for a recovery might be
laid down by the Government within the next few months. There is a
widespread feeling that if the Conservatives do not get the housing
industry wind and watertight before the election, then Tony Blair can
look forward to crossing the threshold into Number 10.
Scotland continues to buck the UK trend, but everyone in the industry
admits that achieving sales is still a hard slog.
Having pushed its Scottish market share up from 5% to 7.4%, Beazer is
showing that that go-ahead companies can make headway north of the
border, but the slow southern market continues to dog the firm's overall
performance. Chief executive Dennis Webb is calling on the Government to
boost the market by providing incentives for first-time buyers, combined
with the reinstatment of the safety net of mortgage protection which was
removed from all new borrowers at the start of this week.
The West of Scotland's leading estate agents agree that urgent action
is needed, but George Storrie, of the Robb Agency, says that mere
inducements to buyers are not enough. ''I've got two words for the
politicians -- feelgood factor,'' he says. ''Short-term incentives are
just like jabs in the arm, they might give the market a slight boost but
their impact won't be sustained.''
He says that addressing particular problems like the shortage of
first-time buyers, negative equity, or repossessions will hardly dent
the problem. ''Almost all of the ingredients for a recovery are in
place. Money is cheap, prices are lower in real terms than for many
years, and there are plenty of nice houses for sale.
''The missing ingredient is confidence. The politicians don't need to
do something for the housebuyer -- they need to do something for the
whole economy.''
Gordon Adams, of G&amp;S Properties, agrees that the current malaise is
not the fault of the property industry. ''The housing market has never
been so well prepared to offer a good service to buyers. Prices are low,
mortgage rates are low, even professional fees and advertising costs are
lower than they used to be.''
Yet people are hesitant about buying, mainly because of job and
economic insecurity. Adams believes that the lack of confidence is the
key factor holding back the whole market.
''When in doubt, do nowt. And most people are doing nowt right now.
The politicians need to stimulate the whole of the economy, not just the
property sector. Only when people feel secure in their jobs will they
start to move up the property ladder again.''
The big lenders have been slow to respond to recent changes in
employment patterns, according to John Guidi of Buckingham Estate
Agency. The increasing number of people who find themselves on
short-term contracts, or self-employed, will find difficulty in getting
loans because the banks and building societies have tightened up their
lending criteria since the property crash.
''The Government needs to persuade the lenders to loosen their
restrictions,'' he says. ''Buying a house is the bedrock of most
people's wealth and security, but if they can't get a loan they can't
take the next step. The lenders are not supportive enough of people in a
rapidly changing employment market.''
He also condemns this week's withdrawal of income support for
unemployed householders. ''It could not have happened at a worse time,''
he says.
A political and fiscal focus on the lower end of the market could get
the property escalator moving forwards and upwards again, according to
Andy Goodearl, of estate agents Euan Wallace &amp; Partners. ''We need to
stimulate the bottom end of the market, especially the first time
buyers' sector,'' he says. ''If we can attract new buyers into cheaper
housing at the lower end, then people further up will have the
confidence to put their own homes on the market and to move upwards
themselves.
''The Government could make a start by giving first-time buyers
special mortgage tax relief on loans of up to #50,000. The rest of the
market would be boosted if stamp duty was abolished, and if the recent
reductions in mortgage tax relief were restored.
''It's crucial for both of the main parties that they get their
housing strategy right,'' he says.
Estate agent Roy Slater agrees that the focus should be on the
first-time buyer: ''The market for houses under #50,000 is dead right
now. But it could be given a kick-start.'' He recommends a restoration
of Miras at the full rate up to #60,000, for the next nine or twelve
months.
''The Government has meddled with the basic infrastructure of the
housing market and has damaged it much more than it realises. Some of
their changes have been far too dangerous. Reductions in Miras and
removal of income support for borrowers who become unemployed are having
a bad effect.
''The Government seems to have had no idea as to the effect these
changes would have.'' However, Slater is confident that the market will
be stronger next year. ''We're on the way to an election and Mr Major
knows that he will have to do something.
''My bet is that he will save up any incentives until next year, then
perhaps have a mini-Budget directed at improving the housing market
sometime around February -- just in time for the spring selling season.
I'm really very confident about it all.''
Although none of the property professionals was prepared to say so,
many of them nurture another secret wish. They would like to see a wee
dose of inflation. Inflation boosts property markets, encouraging people
to sell because the value of their current home has increased.
But as far as both main parties are concerned, inflation is too high a
price to pay, even for a recovery in the housing sector.

* TOP-CLASS professional footballers enjoy a stylish and lavish way of
life. And footballers don't come much more top-class or stylish than
Mark Hately, the Rangers striker who has just concluded a deal to
transfer south of the border, writes STEWART McINTOSH.
One of the things he will miss most about Scotland is Cuilvona, the
magnificent home in Helensburgh which he and his wife have now put on
the market. With marvellous views across the Firth of Clyde and the
countryside at the back door, the house also comes with a famous
next-door neighbour -- Hill House, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's
best-known work of residential architecture.
Cuilvona is a B-listed mock Tudor villa built in 1909. It has
distinctive half-timbers on the upper floor, with matching features on
the ground floor.
It also boasts four public rooms, four main bedrooms and four smaller
bedrooms which were formerly used as staff quarters.
The Hatelys bought the property two years ago and have carried out
extensive renovation and upgrading work. Original period details,
including marble fireplaces and fine timber finishes, were retained.
The large hall has an open beamed ceiling and oak inlaid floor, with
an impressive staircase to the upper floor. The dining room has oriel
windows which look southwards across the garden to the Clyde. The living
room also has an oriel window and features an inglenook fireplace.
Standing behind high hedges that offer real privacy, the house backs
on to open countryside and has about an acre of ground, looking due
south.
''The Hatelys have done a tremendous job in improving the house,''
says selling agent Gordon Adams of G&amp;S Properties. ''They have spent a
lot of money on it and restored it to its former glory.
''Though it is listed anyway, they were happy to retain the period
features. So the result is extremely tasteful and graceful. Whoever buys
it can just walk right in.''
So who might that be? Would-be buyers who hope the Hateley house will
be passed in their direction will have to rush towards the goalmouth.
It's known that an influential potential purchaser is already limbering

Recent Rangers signing Paul Gascoigne may already have the ball at his
feet. He needs a house with plenty of security and, despite a burglary
there last week, Cuilvona's sophisticated security system remains
impressive. He has visited the house, he's in the market, he's got the
cash . . .

MOST estate agents like to boast about the accessibility of the homes
they are marketing. ''Two minutes from motorway'' or ''within easy reach
of town centre'' are usually seen as key selling attractions.
But one estate agency in the Highlands has a couple of properties
which are virtually inaccessible -- unless you are prepared to travel by
boat -- and is emphasising their ''remote possibilities'' as positive
selling points, aimed at those who really want to get away from it all.
One such is Rose-Rowan Cottage, on the Knoydart peninsula, the most
remote part of the British mainland.
Although its tiny community at Inverie is strong enough to support a
pub, a school, and a village hall, Knoydart is the last great untamed
part of the Highlands and is not connected to the nation's road network.
Unless you are fit for an extremely long and arduous walk, the only
way in to the ''rough bounds'' of Knoydart is by boat. Once there,
Rose-Rowan Cottage's would-be buyer will find that the house is on the
shore of Inverie Bay with magnificent views across Loch Nevis towards
Morar, which has a ferry link with Inverie.
The garden contains apple and rowan trees, as well as roses and a
giant hydrangea. The house -- which has been partially renovated, but
needs more work, including the installation of a new kitchen --
comprises sun-porch, living room, four bedrooms, and a bathroom.
The selling agent, Findlayson Hughes of Inverness, is seeking offers
over #75,000 for Rose-Rowan Cottage.

ABERDEEN'S housing sector needs more people prepared to buy before
they sell, according to Gordon Macdonald of surveyors F G Burnett.
He says the preference for selling before buying is one of the key
factors in preventing an upturn in the North-east market.
''What the market really needs is more buyers to get things moving --
and that will only happen if people are prepared to be more positive in
their outlook,'' he says. But he warns sellers to take proper advice and
to ensure that their current home is ''reasonably priced'' before they
buy another house.
''Despite the general sluggishness in the market, most sensibly-priced
properties are selling, and there is no discernible downward trend in
values generally.
''Some properties are going to closing dates, although this is
happening less often than in the recent past. The lower end of the
market in the granite city is fairly buoyant, due to demand for one and
two-bedroom flats at the start of the university year.
''More confidence in the national economy would benefit the local
property market,'' he says. ''Nevertheless, good-quality properties will
continue to sell where they in good condition, with a high standard of
interior, and in a popular location.''

A LARGE estate agent is on the hunt for potential sellers in Glasgow's
city centre.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison has just opened a new branch in Candleriggs
which will serve Merchant City developments such as Ingram Square,
Blackfriars Court, Collegelands, and Carrick Quay. It will also handle
developments in Charing Cross and Festival Park.
''We are pleased to be extending our network at a time when many
stories regarding agencies and the property market in general are
negative,'' says managing director Colvil Johnston.
The company's busy Glasgow city centre market has been bucking the
trend in other districts. ''Sales in August were the best for nearly 18
months and September has been much the same,'' adds Mr Johnston.

ENROLLING masses of students is not the main problem at university or
college right now: it's finding accommodation for them all.
Glasgow School of Art had been planning on celebrating its 150th
anniversary this year with the opening of a new hall of residence, to
coincide with enrolment. It may have missed that by two weeks, with some
early foundation problems, but students haven't suffered as a result.
In fact, 60 or so are currently encamped in a number of hotels close
to the school's base in Renfrew Street. One overseas student who is
disabled is in the Central Hotel and gets a mobility taxi for transport.
''Our new residence is Margaret Macdonald House, named after Charles
Rennie Mackintosh's wife, and will be open for students by October 16,''
says assistant director Michael Foley.
''The formal opening is set for October 27, with a joint ceremony by
the chairman of our Board of Governors, Mr David Leslie, a well-known
Glasgow architect, and the chair of the Student Representative Council,
Blanche Cameron.''
The new building, situated at the corner of Buccleuch Street and
Garnethill Street, is a #1.2m investment, with accommodation for 120
students, including two flats for disabled persons, complete with
telephone access for computer linking to the Internet.
Students will pay #42-a-week for a flat, or #47 for one with en-suite
facilities. All have the use of a kitchen, laundry and sitting rooms.
''This is our first new-build since the 1960s,'' says school director
Professor Dugald Cameron. ''There was no assistance from Government, and
finance had to include part from the private sector. We are delighted to
be able to offer students such modern accommodation.''
The school had three hostels in use until a few years ago. The cost of
refurbishing them was considered excessive, and the decision was taken
to have the new residence built. For a year places were rented from
Glasgow University's stock.
The new building, with its modern set-up including provision for
disabled students, is considered a valuable addition to the school's
facilities and one which helps to attract students in what is now a
highly competitive sector.
There's something of a similar situation at Glasgow Caledonian
University, the city's newest tertiary education institution. In this
case, the new #4.5m Caledonian Court at Dobbie's Loan, with its scope
for 320 students, is expected to be open ''in a few weeks'', says
student accommodation manager Angelina Lamberton.
This is a larger building than the School of Art's new residence and
should effectively take up the slack of students presently outwith
university accommodation, spread over four sites.
''We used to have mainly local students but now there is a broader
intake to the university, including people from the South and from
overseas,'' says Angelina.

THE Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was warned yesterday by one of
Scotland's smaller new councils not to reduce its finances to help city
areas.
SNP Councillor Ian Hudghton, leader of the new Angus Council, said the
Scottish Office would have to address the cities' problems without
expecting a subsidy from the people of Angus.
The problem has arisen over mismatches between the present level of
spending in the area of some of the new councils and the amount of
financial support which the Scottish Office believes they should
receive.
In Angus, spending will actually be less than the Government's target
on which the grant is based. This would in theory allow the new council
to increase spending on services or reduce the council tax.
Both Glasgow and Dundee, however, have recently warned they face large
shortfalls in financial support which could result in large council tax
rises.
Councillor Hudghton said: ''Why we are now concerned is that we have
heard the Scottish Office may be considering evening out the mismatch.
If they do what is being suggested, Angus Council would lose #6.5m, the
equivalent of #184 per year for the Band D council taxpayer in Angus.
He said it was not acceptable that some areas, and particularly the
cities, should be allowed to benefit at the expense of areas like Angus
which had consistently shown themselves to be committed to prudent
spending levels.

A MOTHER went on trial yesterday, accused of murdering one of her
daughters, poisoning another and seriously injuring a third.
A jury at Nottingham Crown Court was told it would hear ''a chilling
catalogue of child abuse which in two cases had devastating
consequences''.
Ms Celia Beckett, 34, is accused of the 1986 murder of her
four-year-old daughter, Tracey. The jury heard she poisoned the child
just three weeks before her death.
She is also charged with causing brain damage to another daughter,
Clare, in 1984 when she was five months old. Clare died from the injury
seven years later.
Ms Beckett, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, is further charged with
poisoning a third daughter, Debbie, and causing her cruelty between 1989
and 1992.
Mr Nigel Rumfitt, QC, prosecuting, said the case represented a
catalogue of errors by Nottinghamshire social services and the county's
police.
Social services was accused of failing to take action, even after the
death of two of the children, while the police were said to have mislaid
vital evidence found after they searched Ms Beckett's flat.
Ms Beckett denies all the charges. She claims the overdoses happened
after the children helped themselves to her anti-depressant drugs.
Police exhumed the children's bodies from their joint grave in a
cemetery in Newark in December 1993.
A second post-mortem examination was held on the body of Tracey, after
it was first thought she died from acute bronchitis. The second
examination showed the illness was brought on by the severe effects of
the anti-depressant drugs, amotryptolene and temazepam.
Mr Rumfitt said that Clare was just five months old when admitted to
hospital in 1984, with serious brain damage.
Beckett said the injury must have been caused when Clare's elder
sister, Tracey, fell on her. However, the court heard that doctors were
baffled by the illness and said the likely cause was a lack of oxygen,
caused by suffocation or a drug overdose.
Clare was admitted to a home for the mentally disabled and died seven
years later.
Witnesses will be called to give evidence that Beckett played
''games'' with her daughters, suffocating them with her hands and
cushions and squeezing them between her knees to stop them crying.
Mr Rumfitt said Tracey was put on the social services' at-risk
register in April 1984. She died two years later after a massive
overdose of drugs, identical to her mother's anti-depressant tablets.
Tracey had been admitted to hospital just three weeks before,
suffering a similar overdose, which she survived.
Debbie, now aged six, was taken into care in October 1992 and lives,
under a new identity, with foster parents.
Ms Beckett is accused of cruelty to Debbie over a three-month period.
The court was told that she pursued a sexual relationship with a
boyfriend, ignoring her daughter, who was subjected to sexual abuse by
the boyfriend.
The court heard that in August 1991 Ms Beckett poisoned her
two-year-old daughter with two tablets of amotryptolene. She claimed
Debbie had taken the drugs herself.
Even after the overdose and the untimely deaths of her two sisters,
Debbie was allowed home to her mother.
The trial continues.

A MAN who stamped on a young student's head so hard that he left
footprints on his face was yesterday jailed for eight years.
Garry McFarlane, 21, set upon Mr Stephen Keddie so severely that the
computer science student was left permanently brain damaged.
Mr Keddie was unable to return to his studies at Abertay University,
Dundee, and cannot live alone, as he requires help with many basic
tasks.
The High Court in Falkirk was told how McFarlane punched his victim on
the face, smashing his nose, after the pair had met briefly in a
nightclub.
Mr Keddie fell and McFarlane started kicking him, knocking the student
unconcious.
McFarlane then began stamping on Mr Keddie's head with such force that
imprints from his trainers were left on his victim's chin.
Mr Keddie was left lying on the road in a pool of blood and was taken
to hospital, where doctors carried out an emergency operation to remove
a brain clot which threatened to kill him.
The court heard he can now only wash and dress himself and is unlikely
to work again after the attack in Queen Margaret Drive, Glenrothes,
Fife, in June of this year.
Yesterday, McFarlane, from Glenrothes, admitted the assault.
Advocate depute Paul McBride told the High Court: ''McFarlane was seen
punching the complainer's head and body and he fell to the ground.
''He seems then to have started stamping on the complainer's head. At
this stage, Mr Keddie was unconcious and unable to resist the attack.
''Witnesses at the scene said he was stamping on his head the way you
would stamp out a fire.
''You could see the footprints of the trainers the accused had on on
the complainer's chin.''
Defence advocate Dennis Crawley said the attack had been fuelled by
drink.
''The unusually large amount of alcohol he had consumed was the
background for this.''
McFarlane was so drunk he did not remember the attack when questioned
by police on the night, but the next morning he realised what he had
done, and told officers he remembered beating Mr Keddie.
Passing sentence Lord Marnoch told McFarlane: ''This was a quite
disgraceful assault which has clearly had very serious consequences for
Mr Keddie.
Referring to the Appeal Court's decision to increase the sentence for
a similar attack, he said: ''I cannot do less than sentence you to a
period of eight years imprisonment.''

ABOUT 50 protesters dominated a news conference held by Dounreay's
management in an Inverness hotel yesterday. They vented their anger at
weapons-grade nuclear fuel being shipped to the Caithness plant for
reprocessing.
Two police officers were on duty at the entrance but no attempt was
made by them oranyone else to stop the protesters.
The UK Atomic Energy Authority gave details of two contracts with a
combined value of #17.5m.
Dounreay's director, Mr John Baxter, estimated that 25 jobs would be
created directly at the plant and 75 to 100 indirectly.
He tried his best to deal with this aspect first but the whole affair
had been overshadowed by the arrival in Caithness on Monday of 52 rods
of spent nuclear fuel from the Hann Meitner Institute in Berlin. They
will be reprocessed at Dounreay rather than be returned to the country
of origin, America.
Dounreay hopes the delivery represents the beginning of up to 10 years
of work reprocessing between 3000 and 6000 rods, which could earn
between #50m and #100m. There are 15,000 rods stockpiled at 40 reactors
around the world which were to have returned to the US until American
policy changed. A recent public consultation in the US suggested
reprocessing at Dounreay as an option.
Mr Baxter agreed to answer questions from protesters as well as from
the press. Mr Shaun Burnie, Greenpeace International's nuclear
campaigner, asked him to confirm that, if Dounreay took the maximum
amount of this spent fuel, its radioactivity would be 100 million
Curies, which would be twice the 50 million Curies released at Chernobyl
10 years ago, which would, in the end, kill between 100,000 and 500,000
people.
Mr Baxter did not challenge the comparative levels of radioactivity
but said: ''The point I would make is the design of the flasks, the way
we handle them, is such that . . . we can handle them so we don't have
the sort of accident Shaun was alluding to. I see them as two very
different issues.''
Mrs Lorraine Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, presented Mr
Baxter with a letter. She said: ''It is asking you to take very
seriously the huge level of public opinion against accepting contracts
for reprocessing in a plant that is 35 years old and not adequate for
the job. We ask you to stop these contracts now and to concentrate on
your other activities.''
Mr Baxter promised to consider the letter, as he would a letter from
the Highlands and Islands Fire Brigade Union saying that the union's
members were concerned that they did not have the resources to deal with
a fire or terrorist attack on a wagon carrying one of these nuclear
cargoes.
As regards the considerable police presence at Scrabster on Monday
when the first rods arrived, he said that was a police matter as
Dounreay was going about its lawful business.
Rob Robertson writes: Campaigners from Friends of the Earth and
Greenpeace dressed in white radiation suits and carrying placards
yesterday handed in a letter to the US Consulate in Edinburgh protesting
against the dumping of US nuclear waste in Scotland.
The protesters, who gathered at the consulate in Regent Terrace, said
Scots would not allow Dounreay to be turned into a nuclear dustbin for
the world's nuclear waste.
Mr Graham Stein, FoE's energy campaigner said: ''Quite apart from the
dangers of transporting these materials around Scotland, the proposed
reprocessing will cause further pollution of air, land, and sea, and
leave a deadly legacy of nuclear waste for future generations.''
He said the fuel rods sent to Dounreay should be stored back in
America where they had originated.
The letter to the American consulate states: ''The risks associated
with transportation to Dounreay are unnecessary and unacceptable. The
flasks containing the fuel rods are transported on non-custom built
ships and along poor standard roads. The flasks are inadequately
designed for realistic accidents which may be faced at sea or on land.''

SNP leader Alex Salmond said yesterday the real story for Scots was in
Scotland and not at the Labour Party Conference at Brighton.
He was responding to a remark by Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson, commenting on the SNP's achievement of 30% in this week's
Herald/System Three poll, that the ''real story'' was in Brighton.
''What happens in Brighton is a side show,'' Mr Salmond said in
Edinburgh. ''What is happening on the south coast of England is
stressing the southern focus of Labour's policies.
''The real issues are being debated here and enthusiasm for
independence is growing all the time. The more Labour display their
southern focus, the more Blair's bubble in Brighton is going to burst.''
The SNP yesterday announced three initiatives. After the success of
its current ''Braveheart'' leaflet, a third run is being printed.
The ''Bravehearts and wise heads'' message will be broadened with a
new leaflet for door-to-door distribution and new materials on the
economics of independence will be available to SNP workers.
Mr Salmond said the initiative would put emphasis on a hard-headed
approach to complement the ''Braveheart'' element. This meant supporting
confidence and courage with reasoned argument.

DISTURBING revelations in BBC Scotland's Frontline Scotland programme,
to be broadcast tomorrow, about alleged dangerous debris from dumps in
the sea between Scotland and Ulster will be raised in the annual defence
debate when the House of Commons returns on October 16.
The issue will be raised by Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley MP
George Foulkes, who said in Brighton yesterday he is deeply disturbed
that debris from the dumps is being washed up on the shores of his
constituency.
He said ''Since this story first broke, I have had two separate
letters from people involved in dumping both explosives and chemicals.
''They confirm that the materials were not all dumped in the
designated area. Instead, large amounts were deposited close to the
shore and constitute a much greater danger than the MoD claims,'' the MP
said.
Mr Foulkes added: ''These two independent contemporary accounts
confirm the Frontline Scotland report, and I will tackle Defence
Secretary Michael Portillo, demanding an urgent investigation by the MoD
to survey the whole area.''
The programme indicates that the dumping of Second World War bombs off
the west coast of Scotland may not be confined to deep water.
People who took part in the dumping at Beaufort's Dyke said they
discarded some of the weapons well short of the Dyke in order to get off
duty as quickly as possible.

THE FIRST of O J Simpson's jurors to speak out after the end of the
case said last night she was certain the panel was right to acquit him.
''I feel free,'' said Brenda Moran, released after 266 days of
sequestration.
''I think we did the right thing -- in fact, I know we did,'' Ms Moran
told reporters as she arrived at her mother's home in Compton, Los
Angeles.
Asked why jurors reached the verdict so quickly, she said: ''We were
there for nine months. We didn't need another nine months to decide.''
She wouldn't comment further.
Other jurors left the courtroom where they spent much of the last nine
months refusing to talk to attorneys or reporters eager for clues to how
they reached their verdict.
For their relatives, the end meant enormous relief.
Luther Wilson, the husband of 72-year-old juror Beatrice Wilson, said
he was happy it was finally over. ''I'm glad it's over with, but I'm
sick of it. I'm just tired.'' -- AP.

The show may be over but, as Ros Davidson reports from California,
there is still a buck to be made
LIKE junkies with no dope, O J diehards may now be facing withdrawal
or wondering how to survive. But not only is the show far from over,
experts on behaviour also say our fascination with such high-level human
drama is rooted deeply in our evolutionary, ape-like past.
Even with Simpson exonerated, there are numerous plans to continue
milking the Trial of the Century. The tale still has, as they say in
Hollywood, enough ''legs' or potential profits to be around for a long
time.
Yesterday thousands of gawkers flocked to Camp O J, the makeshift
media centre of cluttered platforms, scaffolding, and TV vans under
bright floodlights outside Los Angeles' criminal courts buildings where
hundreds of reporters have gathered for the trial.
Donna Giraud bought four T-shirts, one saying, ''Kato the dog, the
only witness''. Like many Californians, she seems to thrive on thrills
on the fault-line: ''This may be over but new things are always
happening around here -- earthquakes, riots. . . something will come
along.''
The Manfre family rushed in on the freeway from suburban Van Nuys.
''When we see smoke we jump in the car and go follow the fire engines,''
explained Mary Manfre. Nearby in the bright California sunshine, Charles
Bowens was selling a dark reminder of the crimes of which Simpson was
acquitted, O J watches with a knife as the minute hand selling for $20.
America has so far lost an estimated $40 billion in work-place time to
O J gossip and discussion since September 1994. That's about the annual
gross domestic product of the Republic of Ireland.
This week's issue of Globe, one of America's most-notorious tabloids,
reveals what it says are unpublished photographs of the blood-drenched
bodies of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman at the crime scene. ''Not for the
squeamish,'' screams the weekly, which sells one million copies and
would make British tabloids seem thoughtful.
A new game was launched this week in Los Angeles, in time for the
holidays. Early sales of Squeeze the Juice, which proclaims it is about
lawyers getting rich and justice at a hefty price, are already brisk at
$24.95.
Tours of the crime scene as well as O J-theme cruises are fully
booked. Even if the Tonight Show drops its comical troop of dancers in
judicial robes, the Dancing Itos, the word is that Judge Lance Ito will
write a book to join the 30 already out on the trial.
First year Harvard law students are now required to read Juice: the OJ
Simpson Tragedy by Larry Browne and Paul Francis even though its prose
is at times purple. Lead defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran, already a hero
in the black community, prosecutor Marcia Clark, the writers Dominick
Dunne, Joe McGinniss, and Jeff Toobin are expected to add the O
J-related pile.
And when Chris Darden, the prominent black prosecutor lost his temper
again in court last week, he vowed to retire from law out of
disillusionment -- and write a book.
Two of Simpson's defence attorneys are trying to sell their idea for a
new TV show -- about two defence attorneys -- in Hollywood.
And this season's hit show by star TV producer Steve Bochco, creator
of NYPD Blue, LA Law, and Hill Street Blues, features one, long murder
trial. And one of Simpson's defence lawyers is of course a consultant on
Murder One.
Even before he was released yesterday, Simpson had been cashing in
from his cell, possibly to pay his high-priced lawyers. The trial is
estimated to have cost the Los Angeles County $8m, and Simpson more than
that to defend.
Simpson will now continue seeking trademark protection for two of his
nicknames, O J and The Juice, on products from clothing to toys, even
although O J is an acronym for orange juice so popular it appears in
American dictionaries.
Since his days as an athlete, Orenthal James Simpson has been known as
'O J or ''sweet as juice''.
Cynics with longer memories note too that this is hardly the first
Trial of the Century. When Bruno Richard Hauptmann was convicted in New
Jersey in 1937 and executed for killing Charles and Anne Morrow
Lindbergh's baby, it was also breathlessly billed as the greatest tale
since the Resurrection.
Yet our fascination is typical primate behaviour, says Professor Katy
Milton at the University of California, an expert of the social
behaviour of primates.
Our ape ancestors and chimpanzee cousins spend an inordinate amount of
time monitoring the fate of others whom they befriend, fight and pursue
--in order to protect their own social status. And the higher the status
of those being watched, the more popular is the voyeurism.
When primate expert Jane Goodall met recently with the leaders of the
Los Angeles police department, she told the gathering of men that a
female chimpanzee meeting high-status males would greet them with a
''pant-grunt.'' To the amusement of the cops, Ms Goodall did just that
-- and their meeting afterwards apparently went unusually well.

AS he walks from the court a free man the last thing on O J Simpson's
mind will have been the size of his lawyers' fees.
Critics of the American legal system readily conclude that, whatever
their amount, he had value for money.
But what about the Los Angeles taxpayer? He might be forgiven for
thinking that the vast expense involved in running the trial has done no
more than create an impression that a public figure with unlimited
resources can escape conviction no matter how compelling the evidence
may be against him.
Most Americans must believe that the episode has done far more for the
ratings of their television channels than it has for the status of their
legal system.
But what about us?
Have those of us who spend the small hours lapping up the antics of
Messrs Ito, Clark, and Cochrane got value for money for all the time we
invested?
Those with long memories will remember how damning the pre trial
publicity was to O J. Not only was the evidence against him paraded in
detail in the world's media but recordings of his apparent flight from
justice were repeatedly shown along with confident assertions from the
prosecutors of his guilt.
Eminent psychologists appeared and, assuming his guilt, provided
explanations for his crime.
It would be difficult for a Scottish lawyer to conceive of pre-trial
publicity which could be more prejudicial to an accused. In Scotland the
press is muzzled by draconian rules which visit potentially huge fines
on the newspapers and the possibility of imprisonment on an offending
editor.
The fear of prejudice to an accused is such that in virtually no
circumstances can he be identified by photograph until he has given
evidence, even when public safety may be at stake after a dangerous
accused has absconded.
The possibility that some, perhaps obscure interpretation of a news
report might be interpreted by an accused, or more often his lawyer, as
prejudicial to his defence, as yet undisclosed, is enough to keep
editors awake at night.
Our system invests large sums in determining whether trials should be
halted because of any potential disadvantage to the accused that such a
report might occasion.
Maybe the pantomime of the O J Simpson trial can teach us something.
The jury were closeted away from the media throughout the trial. They
were only exposed to the pre trial publicity. It did not have much of an
effect on them.
No one knows -- at least so far -- what caused the jurors to decide as
they did, but it seems clear that whatever it was they heard it in the
courtroom. If they had any preconceptions it is difficult to see how
they were altered by what they saw on television or read in the
newspapers before the trial began.
While no one would advocate a media circus we might conclude from O
J's trial that we, like the Americans, have not yet struck the right
balance between the risk of prejudice to the accused and the freedom of
the press. If we learn that lesson, we might get some return on the
viewing time which we invested.

Anne Simpson wonders whether judge and jury will be seen as saints or
sinners
IN a country where sainthood is conveyed upon celebrity, will the
jurors in the O J Simpson odyssey now become the heroes? And, for
others, will Judge Lance Ito be the scapegoat?
Yesterday's verdict in Courtroom 103 proves only that in America the
incomprehensible is possible. The trial of the century has ended by
bringing a powerful nation's legal system into further disrepute.
During the past nine months the jurors' very anonymity had the curious
effect of placing them in the pantheon of fame. Today marks their
freedom from sequestered motel living and the return to their families,
but for them normality will never be the thing it was before that trial
began last January.
What do we know about them beyond the understandable desire for
privacy and their immediate refusal to talk either to attorneys or the
media? Well, we know that they must surely be aware of the million
dollar industries which have swollen up around this murder case, and
that must be at least a strong incentive for them to hang on to their
jurors' notebooks, the grist for some publisher's mill or the stuff of
future auctions.
Up to last June an average of two jurors a month were being dismissed
by Judge Ito, their offences generally centring on contempt or
allegations of racism and bullying. Thus, the reserve pool of candidates
was reduced to two, raising fears that any further expulsions might make
the proceedings so unworkable a mis-trial would be the only verdict.
Today there must be many who believe that outcome, no matter how
unsatisfactory, would have been better.
Now, having astonished the world with their verdict, every one of the
jurors (nine blacks, one Latino and two whites) will still require some
measure of police protection until that day when the story of O J is
shredded as yesterday's news.
The most responsible former jurors describe the remaining panel as
''regular folks'', discreet and measured in their responses and not
naive about the criminal justice system. One of the 10 women, a white,
had served on five previous juries, and in one murder trial she had been
the only person advocating acquittal. But her insistence was so forceful
she won the others to her side.
The fact that this jury has survived so much intense fatigue and gory
detail is said to be due to the unflappable nature of Juror No. 1, the
black woman elected last Friday as the forewoman. ''Fellow jurors would
come up to her with difficulties,'' says a previous member of the panel.
''And she would be careful and restrained in her answers. She was
intelligent, articulate with a good head on her shoulders, and she
didn't shoot off her mouth.''
During the jury's retreat from life Juror No. 1 had another
distinction: she taught her colleagues how to crochet, a hobby which
requires patience, certainty, and usually ties up loose ends.
In recent months the original racial tensions among the jury seemed to
ebb. Their backgrounds were mostly blue collar -- county council
employees, postal workers, a truck driver, a phone company salesman and
an insurance claims adjuster. Only two had college educations.
One of them was Juror No. 1 who on her jury questionnaire located her
home as South Central Los Angeles, a predominantly black working-class
district and the site in 1990 of riots after the acquittal of white
police officers in the beating of Rodney King.
Given yesterday's pronouncement perhaps it is inevitable that the man
who, at the start of the proceedings, was praised for his unshowy wisdom
and ability to curb the egos of legal thespians, now finds himself
condemned by a sizeable chunk of America.
Bored by legalese and outraged not just by the verdict but by the
slack questioning of lawyers, their time-wasting and moments of
incompetence, the public is out for a culprit and many are fixing on
Judge Ito as the villain.
Such criticism, coming also from some of his peers, obviously stung
the judge who in the later weeks of the trial decided to grow tough with
bickering attorneys and jurors nodding off. But by then it was too late.
Lawyers on either side of the case, and even Judge Ito himself, had
become so infected by the publicity virus that they were unable to
suppress their own fever for attention.
The O J odyssey had already rocked the court of authority. The verdict
clearly adds to its mystery but, that apart, all the world may come to
remember is the sight of a disorderly circus crawling over the face of
justice, bloating its own wallet with every breath.

AFTER almost a year of televised courtroom wrangling, the lives and
careers of the main contenders, lead prosecutor Marcia Clark, who has
her own fan club on the Internet, and Johnnie Cochran, the colourful
chief defence attorney, have taken centre stage in US sitting rooms.
JOHNNIE COCHRAN, the head of O J Simpson's ''dream team'' is one of
America's best-known lawyers, who won celebrity status through his
celebrity clients.
He has handled a string of high-profile cases, including negotiating
an out-of-court settlement for Michael Jackson in the child-molestation
case against the superstar.
But he has devoted much of his professional career to fighting on
behalf of mostly black victims of police and other official injustice.
His performance in the final throes of the Simpson case, donning a
knitted cap and gloves in an effort to debunk prosecution theories, was
rated by legal experts as the best of his career.
Prosecutors, defence lawyers and clients who have worked with Mr
Cochran all mention the same things -- his homework is flawless, every
word is calculated, he is tenacious and charismatic, and juries love
him.
His all-black law firm has won more than #30m in judgments against
police departments in California in the past decade. During that period,
he has reportedly earned at least #650,000 a year. That income allows
him to drive around Los Angeles in a Rolls-Royce and dazzle Simpson
trial television viewers with his sartorial style.
Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1938, the son of an insurance
salesman, he moved with his family to Los Angeles at the age of six.
After attending the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), he
graduated in 1962 from Loyola University law school.
He worked as a deputy Los Angeles city attorney representing minority
victims of alleged police brutality following the race riots in the
black section of Watts in 1965.
He went into private practice in 1966 but finally entered the big
league and became a celebrity in his own right in 1993 with the Michael
Jackson case.
Other high-profile cases were the dismissal of rape charges against
football star Jim Brown and the acquittal of teenage actor Todd Bridges
of manslaughter for shooting a drug dealer.
His celebrity friends include actor Denzel Washington, who consulted
Mr Cochran for his role in the movie Philadelphia, and South African
President Nelson Mandela, whom he helped sponsor on a recent trip to the
United States.
MARCIA CLARK, 41, is the tough-as-nails prosecutor who has fought the
media, her former husband and a ''dream team'' of lawyers in the trial.
Like many people involved in the case, Ms Clark's personal life has
become a matter of public record. At times it would appear she enjoys
the spotlight, as when she was hammering away at Simpson's defence with
a mountain of DNA evidence that she hoped would convict him. But at
other times, the stress associated with prosecuting a legend has clearly
taken its toll.
Last April, when she showed up at the courthouse with a new hairstyle,
onlookers and members of the media greeted her with applause, prompting
her to urge them to ''get a life''.
On another occasion, after a particularly bitter exchange with famed
defence attorney F. Lee Bailey, Ms Clark was forced to apologise to the
court for accusing Mr Bailey of lying.
Through it all, Ms Clark has tried to keep the case focused on the
victims, a technique she has honed since she first joined the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office 14 years ago.
In the Simpson case, Ms Clark has tried to be aware of the victims'
families, even going so far as to wear a tiny angel pin on her lapel in
a brief show of support before being ordered to remove it by Judge Lance
Ito.
That close association with the victims' families has drawn criticism
from some legal experts, who claim such behaviour has no place in a
courtroom. But others say she needed to show more warmth in front of the
jury.
For Ms Clark, the trial has been a balancing act between the
courthouse and her role as a single mother. In December, her private
life spilled on to the front pages when she sought more money from her
former husband, Gordon, because her childcare costs had rocketed as a
result of the trial. Ms Clark, who earns about #60,000 a year, also
complained that she needed to update her wardrobe to match her
high-profile role in the case.
Before that, tabloid newspapers published photos of her topless on a
beach in St Tropez. ''I am under constant scrutiny and on public
display,'' she said in court papers.
Born in California, the daughter of an immigrant Israeli chemist, she
was a dancer after college. Her first husband was a professional
backgammon player. The marriage broke up after five years when she went
to law school and their paths diverged. Her second marriage ended just
days before she was assigned to the Simpson case.
IN the furore the victims were all but forgotten.
NICOLE SIMPSON, met her husband in 1977 when she was working as an
18-year-old waitress at a well-known Los Angeles night spot. They were
married in 1985 after he divorced his first wife Marguerite Whitley.
They had two children. In 1989 O J was put on probation for two years
for allegedly kicking, punching, and slapping her. Their stormy marriage
broke up in 1992 and an alleged effort to get back together just before
the murders was a disaster waiting to happen.
RON GOLDMAN, 25, a waiter, was Nicole Simpson's lover and was killed
along with her. They were found stabbed to death on the tiled pavement
outside her Spanish-style town house near Sunset Boulevard. The throats
of Ms Simpson and Mr Goldman were slashed.

The verdict is in, there will be no black riots but, as Patrick Brogan
reports, the gulf between the races in America seems set to widen on a
wave of white resentment against what will be perceived by them as a
biased decision
The big fear in Los Angeles was that if O J Simpson had been
convicted, a new wave of rioting would follow as blacks protested that
white, racist justice had brought down yet another victim.
The danger now is the reverse: not that there will be white riots, but
that there will be yet more polarisation of opinion, between black and
white, with a surge of white resentment at what they consider black
racism.
Johnnie Cochran, the lead defence lawyer, argued that Mr Simpson was
framed by racist police and a racist establishment in the city of Los
Angeles. He said that it was up to the jury to end official racism by
acquitting Mr Simpson, and thus purging the American justice system of
its evil.
Evidently the nine black, two whites, and one Hispanic jurors agreed
with him. Furthermore, they had clearly made up their minds before they
reached the jury room for deliberations.
They were quite sure that O J Simpson was innocent, and that they
would not even go through the motions of debating the issue.
In nine months of testimony and a week of fiery closing arguments,
prosecutors and defence attorneys presented such diametrically opposed
theories that some legal analysts wondered at times whether they were
talking about the same case.
Prosecutors depicted the celebrity defendant as a man so obsessed with
his beautiful ex-wife that when he learned that he could no longer
control her, he killed her in a murderous rage. Goldman was struck down,
prosecutors said, because he was ''in the wrong place at the wrong
time.''
Without a murder weapon, an eyewitness or a confession, however, they
presented a case built on what they described as a ''mountain'' of
circumstantial evidence.
Prosecutors described a ''trail of blood'' leading from the murder
scene to Simpson's mansion and presented a pair of matching bloody
gloves, a blood-stained sock, and strands of hair and fibres. Finally,
they pointed to compelling DNA evidence showing a a minute chance of the
blood belonging to anyone but Simpson.
But Simpson's defence team painted their celebrity client as the
innocent victim of a police evidence-planting conspiracy led by a racist
rogue cop, now-retired Detective Mark Fuhrman.
The Los Angeles Police Department found this hard to swallow. At
police headquarters in Parker Centre, some officers reacted with
disbelief as the verdict was read. ''Unbelievable,'' said one officer.
''I have nothing to say,'' said another.
A detective who watched the verdict on television walked out of the
press room later, saying: ''They let a murderer go.''
However, the theory that Simpson was set up seems to have been
accepted by the jury who appear to have set little store on all the
technical and circumstantial evidence.
The last flurry of speculation by the massed array of experts,
pseudo-experts and media commentators centered around the jury's one
foray into the details of the case.
On Monday morning, the jurors returned to the courtroom to hear read
to them the evidence offered by one of the witnesses.
He was the chauffeur, Allan Park, who had taken his limousine to Mr
Simpson's house at 10.22 on the night of June 14 last year, to pick up
the former football star and take him to the airport.
His evidence, apparently, demolished Mr Simpson's alibi. He testified
that when he reached the house, there was no sign of Mr Simpson's white
Bronco parked outside (it was found there later that night), and that
when he buzzed the house there was no answer.
The prosecution had argued that his evidence was among the most
compelling of Mr Simpson's guilt. The jury listened to a portion of his
testimony, but not all of it: they did not wait to hear his later
evidence that at 10.55 he saw a tall black man enter the house, saw the
lights go on, and that when he then buzzed the house again, Mr Simpson
answered.
Evidently, that evidence changed no one's minds. We will perhaps hear
from the jurors over the next few days and then discover just why they
wanted that bit of testimony read to them again.
Did one of them offer a faint thought that O J was guilty, and was he,
or she, then dissuaded by listening to the driver's evidence? That would
not seem to make much sense. But it provides immense grist to the expert
mills that are grinding away full tilt, and will continue to grind for
days to come.
The white backlash could well be serious. Black defendants often argue
that they are the victims of white racism. Just last week, a black
member of Congress, Mel Reynolds, was sentenced to five years for sexual
offences with a minor, and obstruction of justice. He had been convicted
in Chicago, by a largely black jury.
He proclaimed on the day of his sentencing that: ''Like my slave
ancestors I will be dragged off in shackles.''
He claimed that he was the victim of white racism. Great numbers of
whites bitterly resent the appearance given, at least in the Simpson
case, that blacks can be sure of a sympathetic hearing from a jury, just
on a basis of race.
But the Reynolds case demonstrated that blacks can be convicted. It is
not true that playing the race card will always win an acquittal. But it
worked for O J and no doubt other black defendants will try it, and more
whites will denounce them as criminals escaping their just desserts.
One who did escape, five years ago, was the mayor of Washington,
Marion Barry. He was acquitted on most of the charges against him,
despite the fact that he had been filmed buying cocaine and snorting it
in a hotel room, because one or two jurors refused to convict him, come
what may.
In 1991, a largely black jury in New York refused to convict an Arab
who had shot a Jewish extremist, Meir Kahane.
The man was caught running from the scene of the crime, carrying the
gun that had killed Mr Kahane. He hijacked a taxi to escape, but was
stopped by police.
His defence lawyer, William Kunstler, a prominent liberal Jewish
attorney in New York, played the race card, suggesting that police were
framing the accused.
He insinuated that the accused was in the dock because Jews are
racists and clearly Mr Kahane was a racist Jew.
Verdicts come the other way, too. When the four police officers who
beat Rodney King in 1991 were put on trial for the first time, in April
1992 the trial was moved out of Los Angeles to the suburbs, to find an
unbiased jury.
It turned out that Simi Valley, where the trial was held, was filled
with police officers and their friends and the four were acquitted,
despite the evidence of a video of them laying into the hapless Mr King.
Despite the constitutional provisions against double jeopardy, the
four were tried again, this time with a largely black jury, in Los
Angeles, and were convicted.
It is not very probable that the state of California or the federal
authorities will try the same trick on O J Simpson, but the family of
Ron Goldman says that it will sue him in civil court for wrongful death.
They will try again to prove that he killed the unfortunate young man
(and also Nicole Simpson).
But the fact that the state jury acquitted him so completely, and so
rapidly, suggests that the Goldmans will have a hard time of it.
Mr Simpson's lawyers have suggested in the past that Mr Simpson will
appear on television, in a pay-per-view programme, to give his own
detailed account of the event. He did not testify at his trial. Now he
can do so.
They hope to raise $4m and Mr Simpson also hopes to sell a second book
of memoirs (the first made a nice packet early this year).
He certainly needs the money: the dream team of lawyers assembled to
defend him ran at $400 an hour each, for months on end.

MR TONY Blair has produced an exciting new prospect for his party in
government.
''Traditional values in a modern setting. . . a tempered vision,'' his
deputy John Prescott called it. It was enough for Arthur Scargill to
threaten to tear up his party membership card.
It was a brilliant feat of oratory linking his ''New Labour'' to a
''New Britain'', still cautious on the cost of it all but carrying a
truly reformed Labour Party forward into the challenge of creating a
truly reformed nation.
It owed much to the late Harold Wilson whose 1963 ''white heat of
technology'' conference speech won him the next election; and to
President Kennedy who famously suggested that Americans should seek to
know not what their country could do for them, but what they could do
for their country.
The Blair philosophy for government was set out very clearly and very
few Labour Party members found him wanting.
He has set the Tories next week in Blackpool a problem, although both
he and his Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown are relying greatly on a
windfall tax on privatised utility profits to finance what would be a
millennium revolution in across the board education at all stages of an
ordinary life.
His youthfulness, his generation as he calls it, sets the Prime
Minister a severe task in matching his eagerness, freshness, and
integrity. Mr Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, will be hard
put to match his electrifying announcement that he has done a deal with
British Telecom to let them into the entertainment market providing they
connect up every school, hospital, and library to high technology.
It was a dogma-free speech which finally swept away all the hidebound,
centralist, socialist ideas which he suggested were right for their time
but are no longer relevant to the nation now.
''The arms race may be over,'' he said, ''the knowledge race has
begun.'' Britain's national assets, its people, its technology and its
language must be developed. ''Neglect it -- we fail. It is as simple as
that.''
The BT deal announcement was his chief original idea. But he would
also create a ''University for Industry'' combining the private sector,
government, universities, research centres, and science labs for an
advanced system of further education ''for people at work and for people
who lose their job''.
His third public-private initiative is to link education authorities
and the computer companies to provide access to a lap-top computer for
every child.
''We will put our education system right. No more dogma. No more
aguments about structures.''
He is also aiming for a nursery place for every three and
four-year-old.
At the heart of the Blair vision is taking the old Thatcherite market
solution to problems by the scruff of the neck and shaking out the ''fat
cats'' of privatisation and using a state/private co-operation to effect
the traditional Labour value of redistribution of wealth.
The railways are to be publicly owned and publicly accountable -- but
this simply seems to mean that private expertise will be utilised and
the Treasury will be made to relax its rules on borrowing. Mr Blair
stops very far short of promising to renationalise anything.
The way he looks at this fundamental political issue infuriates the
likes of Arthur Scargill, Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner, and the rump of the
old hard left. In the dogma-free Blair philosophy is a profoundly
pragmatic approach: ''If it ain't broke don't mend it.''
But at the same time -- and this is what carries the likes of Mr Jimmy
Knapp along -- the prosposed carve-up of British Rail will be not only
prevented but, in a way not yet clear, utilised.
These are what he calls his ''simple truths'', a collection of the
best political ideas over the last 20 years, blended with a Christian
socialism. Had the Labour Party not changed it could not change the
country. ''We could not win and even if we did, we could not have
governed in the way Britain needs.''
He acknowledged the vital roles of his predecessors Neil Kinnock and
John Smith, in modernising the party. Labour had taken some hard
decisions and now it is faced with some ''hard choices'' in government.
And underpinning the Blair vision, and seeking to protect it from the
Tories next week and beyond, was this statement: ''I don't give blank
cheques in any area of policy, no matter what the pressures.'' Yesterday
Mr Blair looked like a politician with a new approach and, what is more
important, one that sounds like he knows how to implement it.

SNP leader Alex Salmond last night criticised Mr Blair for talking for
an hour about ''New Britain'' but devoting just 14 words to Scotland. He
said even this passing reference was extracted under the pressure of a
surge in SNP support in the latest Herald/System Three opinion poll.
Mr Salmond said: ''One Britain and one nation -- Tony Blair's constant
refrains -- will have struck no chord with the vast majority of Scots
whose identity is now overwhelmingly Scottish, not British, as recent
polls show.''
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth accused Mr Blair of devoting only
five words -- ''Scotland shall get its parliament'' -- to the issue of
Scottish devolution.
Mr Forsyth said: ''So much for George Robertson's flagship policy. His
leader does not seem to attach the same importance to a Scottish
parliament as does his Shadow Scottish Secretary.''
He added: ''Mr Blair denounced the Government for supposedly 'tearing
apart the fabric of our nation' and for 'tearing apart the bonds that
tie communities together and make us a United Kingdom.' That is exactly
what a Scottish parliament would do.''
Liberal Democrat president Robert Maclennan welcomed Mr Blair's
remarks on constitutional reform and his acceptance of the need to
co-operate on the issue.
''The Government which Britain needs requires openness to the ideas of
others and a readiness to build on the diversity and pluralism of our
country,'' he said.
However, Mr Blair's speech was hailed as one of the best in living
memory by Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
He said: ''That was one of the most powerful speeches by our political
leader in a generation, reaching out into every living room in the
country with a positive and practical vision for the future.''
Former Prime Minister Lord Callaghan praised the speech as being
better the he had ever made himself.
For TGWU leader Bill Morris the speech had put ''flesh on the bones of
Labour's values''.

WHO, including great swathes of instinctively Tory voters, could have
failed to be moved -- and moved deeply -- by Tony Blair's impassioned
indictment of Old Britain in Brighton yesterday?
Petty crime, casual violence, and mindless drug abuse are not the
pernicious preserves of forlorn inner cities. The shires, too, have
their distressing first-hand experiences of yob culture.
Old verities everywhere are crumbling to dust. The shadow of job
insecurity has crept inexorably from the shop floor across the ranks of
middle management and into the professions. Negative equity has turned
many an Englishman and woman's home into, not a castle, but a prison.
Personal stress and family breakdown are reaching epidemic
proportions. Decent, civilised society is sorely strained.
People, at every level, are frightened for their own futures and
scared witless at the thought of how their children will earn a living
in the new millennium. Politicians, of all hues, have seldom been held
in deeper popular contempt.
The poor scratch away at cards which represent their last hope of a
passport to better times. Too many businesses cut costs because they've
lost the ability to expand their markets. As a result, even more people
face a scratch card future.
Crumbling public infrastructure is increasingly at the mercy of
handouts from the Millennium Commission or a private finance intiative,
bound and gagged by Whitehall red tape.
Enter Tony Blair, giving powerful voice to a collective moral outrage
at the state of Old Britain, a voice which rang all the clearer because
it hasn't been heard, in such unambiguously moral tones, for so very,
very long.
This speech would have sounded like a spoilsport's cry from the
wilderness in the free-booting eighties, when all that mattered was you,
as an individual, and enterprise was doubling your money, and more, by
buying anything from shares in under-priced privatisations to your
council house.
But in late 1995, in this small group of offshore European nations,
nostalgically drowning in history, heritage and tradition,
xenophobically distrustful of its immediate neighbours, there is a
tangible hunger for a fresh vision of how to restore to Britain a more
collectively confident, prosperous and civilised future.
I am, I suppose, a pretty cynical, world-weary observer of the great
and the would-be good. I've known for a long time that emperors are
typically short of a garment or two. I had the present Labour leader
down as tough, determined, ruthless even, in dragging his party to the
realisation that, if you wish to change the world, you first have to win
the power to make the changes.
But I regarded his reluctance to be drawn on specific policy
commitments as an attempt both to avoid the disastrous mistakes of the
recent past (notably the Shadow Budget in 1992) and to sell Labour this
time round using the same sophisticated techniques the marketing
industry deploys to sell this brand of washing powder or that brand of
biscuits.
In short I suspected Tony Blair, as many of his opponents do, of
tailoring all his rhetoric and the few policy commitments he has so far
allowed, to what he thought would sell best in the country. I didn't
think he was in the hands of spin doctors. I thought he was being
groomed by an army of brand managers.
I had failed to allow for Blair's festering, simmering anger at the
state of Britain today. That sense of betrayal, that passionate moral
rage dominated his leader's speech in Brighton yesterday. Even when
witnessed on a television screen, 450 miles away, it was an electrifying
experience. I doubt I've heard a better political set-piece in the past
thirty years.
You could see the impact on the shining, smiling faces of delegates,
young and old. He was articulating their anger, their rage, their
betrayal too. I suspect, as I said at the outset, that his clarion call
for the creation of a new, modern, forward-looking Britain played well
with viewers of all political persuasions, too. Yesterday Blair pushed
all the right buttons.
In essence, he was sketching out Labour's contract with Britain.
Promises on what Labour would deliver on education, on crime control, on
unemployment and welfare were each hedged with demands on each and every
one of us, as citizens, to promise and deliver something in return.
But -- and it's a big but -- there was still too little beef on the
policy bones Blair outlined. Plans to plug every school, every college,
every hospital, every library on to the information superhighway for
free, in an imaginative contra-deal with British Telecom, sound
radically, digitally forward-looking.
But, like the million pounds from the proposed windfall tax to be
spent in year one of a programme to get the young unemployed back into
productive work, yesterday's pledges still leave many questions
unanswered.
Arguably, the core problem with our education system is that it still
leaves a large rump with no discernible qualifications or skills at the
end of eleven years of compulsory education. Wouldn't any money that is
available to improve education be better spent earlier in the process to
reduce that wanton wastage of so many young people?
It may be that Blair reckons the Tories will take this Parliament
right up to the wire in 1997 and wants to keep a lot of his detailed
policy options open.
On yesterday's form, he could well be right on the first point. But it
could also be that, such are the complexities of the challenges facing a
proud, but declining mature economy like Britain's, that, despite the
undeniable moral outrage he demonstrated yesterday, Tony Blair's Labour
Party has yet to find more credible policy solutions to the problems we
face.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday set out his ambition for a British
technological revolution. ''I want us to be a young country again,'' he
told the party conference.
In a major announcement, he disclosed that under a deal with Labour,
BT has agreed to build, for free, a multi-billion-pound
telecommunications network linking every school, college, hospital and
library in the country.
During an hour-long address designed to both set out his plans and
crush his critics, Mr Blair defined the moral purpose that drives his
beliefs, and his patriotic commitment to a British revival.
With Harold Wilson's widow, Mary, listening from the platform, Mr
Blair put a technological revolution at the forefront of his aims. It
was time for Britain to escape the burden of its history: ''We live in a
new age but in an old country. We are proud of our history, but its
weight hangs heavy upon us.''
He pledged Labour to renationalise the railways, and promised to
reduce primary class sizes to less than 30 pupils.
In an impassioned assertion of Labour's claim to be the party of
Britain, he declared: ''I love my party. I just hate it being in
opposition. I love my country. And I hate what the Tories have done to
it.''
The slogan New Labour New Britain represented his commitment to
overhauling the country's attitudes. ''I present to you today our
proposals to equip our people and businesses for new technological and
economic challenges, and to change the basis of this country's thinking
of the last 100 years.''
As a first step, he disclosed that in exchange for allowing BT free
access to the electronic information market, the telecom giant will
deliver what Mr Blair described as a market solution that would be one
of the cornerstones of Labour's new, young Britain.
''We should aim for free and fair competition and end the restrictions
that have prevented BT, Mercury and others from playing their part in
wiring up Britain,'' he said.
Labour had been in discussion with BT: ''In return for access to the
market, I can announce they have agreed, as they build their network, to
connect up every school, every college, every hospital and every library
in Britain for free.''
BT estimates the network would take at least five years to build and
could cost up to #15bn, but would connect even the remotest parts of the
country to the world-wide system of computerised information, the
information superhighway.
Development of the network will be matched by a proposal, being
negotiated by Labour with education authorities and computer companies,
to ensure that every school child has access to a personal lap-top
computer. It was, Mr Blair said, a new way for a new age: ''That is what
I mean by new Labour.''
He acknowledged the extensive changes the party has experienced since
its defeat in 1983, but added: ''I didn't come into politics to change
the Labour Party. I came into politics to change my country.''
Fundamental change was essential if Labour was to survive in
Government. ''I do not want a one-term Labour Government that dazzles
for a moment then ends in disillusion. I want a Labour Government that
governs for a generation and changes Britain for good.''
He also brushed aside suggestions that his relations wth deputy leader
John Precott have become strained over policy and presentational
differences, describing him as ''a good friend and a great support.
Blunt, honest and outspoken. And that's just with me.''
Mr Blair was interrupted by applause more than 70 times, as he sought
to reassure Labour rank-and-file of both his commitment to Labour and
its traditions, and his determination to win.
Labour would guarantee an integrated and fully public transport
system. Although he did not give blank cheques under pressure, he warned
those considering investing in the privatised railways: ''There will be
a publicly owned and publicly acountable railway system under a Labour
Government.''
The ''hundreds of millions'' being spent on selling the railways would
be used to upgrade and modernise the service.
Mr Blair challenged the Tories to abandon plans for a #600m identity
card scheme and invest the money instead in putting 3000 more police on
the beat.
He said that proposals to levy a windfall tax on the profits of
privatised companies would lead to a revolution in skills training.
A Labour Government would work to transform the health and education
services, tackle crime on the streets, renew democracy, house the
homeless, improve the transport system and help those unable to help
themselves.
He said that education did not stop when people walked out of the
school gates for the last time.
Knowledge was power and information was opportunity, Mr Blair
said.''And technology can make it happen -- if we use it properly.''
The private sector, government, universities, research centres and
science laboratories had to be brought together to put together an
advanced system of further education for the electronic age.
''It requires a supreme national effort,'' Mr Blair said. 'The market
won't do it. A Labour government will.
''We have started work on it already. It will be called the University
for Industry and it will transform education and skills in Britain and
make lifelong learning a reality.''
Mr Blair pledged: ''We will put our education system right -- no more
dogma, no more arguments about strictures.
''For every school, fair and equal funding. No return to selection,
academic or social, but a new deal in our classrooms. We will be the
champions of standards for the twenty-first century.''
He also wanted a new adult-pupil ratio in classes and proper
assessment for all five-year-olds, with schools ''playing to their
strengths''.
Mr Blair said: ''We will take the excess profits of the new robber
barons of Tory Britain in the privatised utilities and use it for the
most radical programme of work and education ever put forward in
Britain.''
Labour would use that money ''and end up saving money'' by giving
single parents the chance not to live on benefit ''but to plan their
future, organise childcare and training so they can support themselves
and their children.''
Turning to reform of the criminal justice system, Mr Blair pledged ''a
comprehensive programme to deal with juvenile offending, action to
tackle drug abuse, proper treatment of victims and witnesses''.
There would be ''tougher penalties on violence or guns, a crackdown on
those who make life hell in their local neighbourhoods through noise or
disturbance''.
He called for justice and fairness in the workplace.
However, Mr Blair also emphasised that responsibilities went with
rights, and insisted that some Tory union reforms would remain: ''Leave
the battles of the past. Ballots, peaceful picketing, proper conduct of
disputes, these laws are staying.
''But there will be new rights for all individuals at work. A Labour
government will be part of the Social Chapter.''
He promised a statutory minimum wage -- but did not mention any
figure.
On public services, Mr Blair said Labour would ''sweep away the dogma
. . . they need modernising, but keep them as public services and make
them serve the public again, not vested interests of any kind''.
Labour would save the National Health Service and change it for the
better, with an end to the Tory internal market and a system of GP
commissioning to replace GP fundholding.
Mr Blair announced Labour was putting a proposal from world-class
consultant Professor Robert Winston -- in the audience yesterday -- to
use technology to create regional centres of excellence in specialist
care, directly linked through the party's superhighway proposals, to
local hospitals and surgeries.
He promised: ''Scotland shall have its parliament. Wales will have its
assembly. They will be legislated for in the first year.''
Mr Blair said that when he walked with Tory Ministers down London's
Mall during this year's celebrations to mark the anniversary of the end
of the Second World War, many of the thousands of people lining the
route and waving Union Jacks were Labour and urging him: ''Get the
Tories out!''
He said: ''These are our people. They love this country, just as we
do. It is because they love this country that they look to us to change
it.
''So let us say with pride: we are patriots. This is the patriotic
party. Because it is the people's party.''
He said he had a promise for the British people: '' I will do all I
can to get the Tories out.''

CONFERENCE yesterday overwhelmingly rejected an attempt by miners'
leader Arthur Scargill to reverse the changes to Clause 4 won by Tony
Blair earlier this year.
After a brief and sometimes acrimonious debate which marked the end of
Mr Scargill's career as a conference irritant, delegates voted almost
unanimously against his proposed amendment to the party constitution,
which would have reintroduced a commitment to nationalisation.
It was the first of two blows for the left wing of the party as
conference also decided to back the National Executive Committee in its
overruling of Liz Davies as prospective parliamentary candidate for
Leeds North East.
Mr Scargill, once a perennial darling of the conference for his fiery
oratory, was heard in near silence, his appeal to the party to renounce
capitalism and reaffirm its faith in socialism resolutely ignored, as
was his warning that too much power was being concentrated in Mr Blair's
hands.
The vote was taken on a show of hands. Mr Scargill could muster only
the support of his NUM, the bakers' union, the construction union Ucatt,
and the rail unions Aslef and RMT, who control fewer than 5% of the
conference votes.
Instead, he had to endure the condemnation of a succession of speakers
who accused him of being a source of division.
His critics were led by Cunninghame North MP Brian Wilson, in a repeat
of his impassioned performance in the Clause 4 debate last April, who
told Mr Scargill: ''We've had a gutful of fantasy politics.''
Mr Scargill has pursued his attempt to save the original version of
Clause 4 since April, when a special party conference voted to abandon
its historic commitment to the comprehensive nationalisation of the
''means of production, distribution, and exchange''.
He initiated legal action against the party, claiming constitutional
changes only could be approved at full conference. Several months ago,
he agreed to drop his suit in exchange for a debate this week in
Brighton.
Addressing delegates, he said Labour should return to its true
beliefs. 'It must have a policy, it must have a philosophy which is
fundamentally different from that of other parties which support the
free market and capitalism.''
A commitment to socialism should remain at the heart of the party's
beliefs.
In reply, Mr Wilson said the debate gave Labour a chance to take stock
of the changes to the constitution introduced six months ago. The new
wording had not diluted Labour's campaign to halt railway privatisation.
'I don't know about you Arthur, but to the rest of us it's the same
aims, same values, same determination in October as in April. If
relevance and accuracy of language is a crime, then we plead guilty.''
Addressing Mr Scargill directly, he added: ''The truth is, Arthur,
most of us have had a gutful in the 1980s of playing fantasy politics.''
On an overwhelming show of hands, the conference accepted the national
executive was right to overrule the Leeds North East constituency who
wanted to adopt Ms Davies as parliamentary candidate.
Leeds delegate Barbara Levy warned the conference that they would be
voting for centralised ''intolerance and proscription'' over local
democracy and would be giving way to ''shameful manouevring, smears, and
innuendo.''
She also hinted that yesterday's vote might be subject to legal
action, saying: ''We will challenge this as far as we can.''
It was left to leading left-winger Clare Short to deliver the death
blow to Ms Davies' parliamentary aspirations. ''The Labour Party must
always be a broad church but to preserve this members must have both
rights and responsibilities,'' she said. ''We must treat each other with
respect and when there is a vote we must honour it.''
This was a double reference to Ms Davies record of voting against her
group as a councillor in Islington and her involvement in the left-wing
publication Labour Briefing, which Ms Short characterised as ''nasty and
vicious''.

NEW Labour has come to a historic agreement with the trade unions
which should remove much of the animosity between the two wings of the
labour movement,enabling maximum co-operation in the run-up to the
General Election.
The first fruits were evident yesterday when party modernisers
marshalled the votes of union affiliates to despatch old-style irritants
Liz Davies and Arthur Scargill and cut union influence at future
conferences from 70% to 50% of the total conference vote.
However, the price of co-operation from the union affiliates that
created the party was that their share of conference votes should not
dip below 50%.
The first hint of this new accommodation on voting appeared in The
Herald on Monday and was formally disclosed yesterday by Glasgow
dustcart driver Dan Duffy, who is both chairman of the largest affiliate
the Transport and General Workers' Union and a member of the Labour
Party executive.
It was in his party NEC capacity that Mr Duffy recommended the 50-50
rule change to conference and opposed a motion seeking to preserve the
present 70% union vote while introducing a sliding scale to reduce it to
''not less than 50%'' over a period of years.
Speaking for the NEC, Mr Duffy said that the proposed 50-50
arrangement would provide a balance between the constituency parties and
the unions, give equal weight to both types of membership, and
strengthen the party's traditional links with the unions.
The sliding scale concept would mean the issue remaining a running
sore that would be picked on at conference after conference whereas the
50-50 balance would ''settle the issue once and for all''.
The Herald can now reveal that the deal was struck as long ago as July
when Tony Blair made the ''50% and no further'' concession to union
members at a meeting of the trade union and Labour Party liaison
committee.
Labour Party ''fixers'' were keen to win union agreement to kill off
the sliding scale proposal because they realised that it could slide
both ways, leading to increased union influence should Labour's
impressive membership gains falter.
Other rule changes balloted on yesterday and almost certainly endorsed
-- although the results must wait until this morning -- include one
giving the party leadership greater control by enabling the executive to
bypass the annual conference by appealing directly to the membership in
a one-member-one-vote ballot.
Ironically, the deal on union voting strength leaked out as Labour and
union leaders were busy trying to play down suggestions that another
meeting of the liaison committee had agreed an election strategy.
Mr Nigel Harris, acting president of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, insisted the meeting was ''routine''.
''There was no mention of any special favours and Tony did not promise
us anything.''
Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union,
said: ''There was absolutely no question of any deals being made at that
meeting. We merely discussed several issues to get a clearer picture of
the views of unions.''
While this may be technically correct, they are clearly mending fences
and closing ranks in anticipation of the forthcoming election.

CAMPAIGNERS for gender equality of representation at Westminster were
last night hailing a victory, after the crushing defeat of a motion to
scrap all women shortlists for candidates, Robbie Dinwoodie writes.
The chairwoman of the Scottish Labour Party, Rhona Brankin said after
the vote: ''I am delighted. There was overwhelming support for getting
as many women MPs as possible into Parliament. The motion says there
will be a review of the issue after the next General Election, but in
effect it means that the current method will continue unless changed by
conference.''
Party leader Tony Blair is understood to have been concerned at
possible electoral damage from the imposition of all-women lists in half
of seats where a sitting MP is retiring and in half of other winnable
seats.
Scotland is one area where these quotas have been achieved and
Scottish women delegates were to the fore yesterday in urging defeat of
a motion scrapping this procedure.
That motion claimed that gender discrimination had no place in a
democratic party and this was what women's quotas amounted to. Slough
delegate William Howard said these lists had been abused and manipulated
and the policy had been squeezed through almost unnoticed at conference
two years ago.
He said they were proud in his area of the fact that they had the
first female black mayor in Britain and had been proud to have Joan
Lestor as their MP, but of all- women lists, he said: ''Enough is
enough.''
One of the most powerful speeches in favour of positive action to put
women into Parliament came from North Tayside delegate Anne Begg.
She pointed out to the conference that a special lift had been
installed on the stage and the lectern had been designed to be lowered
to help people such as herself who wanted to address the gathering from
a wheelchair. ''For me to have equality of opportunity the party has had
to take positive action,'' she said.
She made the point forcefully that creating new procedures for the
selection of parliamentary candidates was no different from the
construction work which helped her reach the podium.
''Under the old system, it may have appeared that women had the same
chance as men but they did not,'' she said.
Ms Begg said Labour had to get more women into parliament and it would
take radical measures to achieve that.
Strathclyde councillor Neelam Bakshi also claimed it was ridiculous
for anyone to suggest that the affirmative action for women candidates
had been carried out surreptitiously. ''It was a historic decision. We
are watching a great transformation in the making.''
Ms Brankin, representing the national executive's women's committee
told the conference that equality of opportunity was at the heart of
Labour's values.
She pointed out that the Labour Party was committed to gender equality
for its proposed Scottish parliament, a project she described as ''an
exciting and challenging task.''
She added: ''Only a parliament that is truly representative of men and
women has the democratic legitimacy to change peoples lives.''

A SPANIEL which has spent nine months on ''death row'' after biting a
policeman was reprieved yesterday by three appeal court judges.
A sheriff ordered five-year-old Kauma to be destroyed following an
incident in a pub in Gretna.
Mrs Ann Brown, the dog's owner, and her husband Ron, were working as
relief managers at the Crossways Inn, Annan Road, Gretna, when police
went to the pub in answer to a 999 call in June 1994.
As Mrs Brown opened the door, Kauma rushed out and attacked PC Leslie
Kirkpatrick, biting him on the hand and inner thigh.
It then bit at his anorak, clenching its teeth and hanging from it
until it released its grip and the constable managed to kick it away.
In January this year, Mrs Brown, of Edgehill Road, Harraby, Carlisle,
was fined #100 at Dumfries Sheriff Court for having a dog which was
dangerously out of control.
After the sheriff decided that Kauma must be put down, Mrs Brown
lodged an appeal and 4000 people signed a petition calling for clemency.
At the Justiciary Appeal Court yesterday, Mr William McVicar, defence
counsel, argued that what the policeman had suffered was so minor that
it could not be classed as an injury at all.
PC Kirkpatrick had suffered only red marks where Kauma had attacked
him and the skin had not been broken. In these circumstances, the
destruction order was not mandatory and the court had a discretion over
the dog's future.
Lord Sutherland, sitting with Lords Kirkwood and MacLean, agreed that
the dog should be reprieved.
Ann and Ron Brown said yesterday they were ''absolutely delighted''
with the reprieve.
The couple expect to be reunited with the family pet today. Kauma has
been kept in Cairnsmore Kennels near Dumfries by order of the court. The
kennel owners were informed by the court yesterday that he was free to
go.
A Dumfries and Galloway Police spokesman said: ''The appeal court has
made its decision and that's the end of the matter as far as we are
concerned.''
* A fresh move to save American pit bull terrier Dempsey was launched
yesterday. The seven-year-old bitch was sentenced to be destroyed after
her muzzle was taken off in public when she fell ill.
Last month, a judge at Central London County Court said the execution
order imposed in 1992 should be carried out but the police said Dempsey
would be spared for 28 days pending an appeal being lodged.
Solicitor Trevor Cooper, representing owner Dianne Fanneran, of
Hanwel, West London, confirmed that papers were being lodged with the
Court of Appeal.

THE imaginary Wessex town of Christminster is to berecreated in
Edinburgh for a film adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel Jude the
Obscure.
The cast will be on location around the capital -- from the New Town
to Leith -- for two weeks between October 17 and November 2.
The big-screen version of the Victorian melodrama will feature Shallow
Grave's Christopher Eccleston in the title role with Kate Winslet -- of
Sense and Sensibility and Heavenly Creatures -- as Sue Bridehead, the
cousin he loves.
The cast list also includes Rachel Griffiths from Muriel's Wedding as
Jude's wife, Arabella, while June Whitfield leaves behind her most
recent role in Absolutely Fabulous to recreate the role of Jude's Aunt
Drusilla.
The film tells the story of Jude Fawley, a stonemason with
intellectual aspirations, who is seduced into marriage by Arabella. When
she abandons him, he returns to education and falls for his cousin, who
runs away from her schoolmaster husband to join Jude in an illicit union
that ultimately leads to tragedy.
Filming will also take place on location in Northumberland, London,
and New Zealand.
Director, Michael Winterbottom admitted the tragic Hardy love story is
his favourite novel.
''It's a fantastic love story, a very bleak love story, but there is
light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said.
The film is jointly produced by Polygram Filmed Entertainment in
association with BBC Films and Revolution Films.
Shooting in Edinburgh has been welcomed by Edinburgh and Lothian
Screen Industries.

A WOMAN who sued for #30,000 after a jury returned a not proven
verdict against her alleged sex attacker, yesterday settled her case out
of court.
Miss X raised a civil action against the man, a former North Sea
diver, following the incident in her home in Aberdeen, in June 1989.
She said that after she met him, in a wine bar in Aberdeen, and
invited him back to her home for a coffee, he began to shout and swear
and call her obscene names.
According to Miss X, he ordered her to take off her blouse before
carrying out a sustained sexual assault. She said she managed to kick
him in the groin before she ran screaming for help to her neighbours.
She alleged that the man ran past her into the street, chased by her
dog, which was still in pursuit when he was caught a short time later.
The case went to trial at Aberdeen Sheriff Court in May 1990, and the
jury returned a verdict of not proven.
Miss X, who received a #1750 payment from the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Board, then lodged a #30,000 damages claim at the Court of
Session, in which she alleged she had suffered from post-traumatic
stress disorder as a result of the assault.
She claimed she had also suffered from nightmares, anorexia, and
feelings of humiliation and worthlessness.
The man, who lives in Wales, admitted that he had gone back to her
flat but claimed that at first she had agreed to his sexual advances.
However, after some sexual activity, her mood changed and she became
abusive and hysterical.
Yesterday, Mrs Anne Smith, QC, told Lord Johnston that a settlement
had been reached in the case but she did not disclose the terms.
Both Mrs Smith and Mrs Ann Paton, QC, counsel for the man, asked the
judge to ban the press from reporting details of the case.
Mrs Smith informed the court that the woman's post traumatic stress
disorder was likely to be made worse by publicity about her case.
Mrs Paton stressed that the out-of-court settlement in the present
action had been made without any concession by her client, who had been
acquitted at his trial.
Lord Johnston pointed out that the courts were public and if the woman
had chosen to come into court she could not seriously expect it not to
be reported.
However, in view of what he had been told about her medical condition,
he felt that she was entitled to claim anonymity. In that case, the man
should also not be named, in case that led to the identification of the
woman.
The judge asked members of the press to use their discretion not to
name the parties to the action.

EXCLUSIVE
SCOTTISH Enterprise, Scotland's flagship economic development agency,
is bracing itself for a cut of up to 15% in its #450m annual budget in
the face of irresistible Government pressure for substantial savings in
public expenditure.
SE chairman Professor Donald MacKay has told his colleagues to expect
a reduction in the organisation's budget allocation of anywhere from
five to 15%, and has spent the past year preparing SE for the blow.
Later this month, he will meet Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to
discuss SE's fate in the forthcoming Government spending round. He is
understood to be resigned to ''doing more with less''.
Implications for SE's 1200 staff, spread across its network of 13
Local Enterprise Companies (LECs), is unknown but observers suggest job
cuts are inevitable. Redundancies may be avoided in part thanks to SE's
reliance on outside consultants and short-term contracts, and an SE
source said: ''No redundancies are on the agenda''.
According to sources close to Professor MacKay, he believes that SE
has established itself sufficiently to be able to withstand the effects
of the cuts. One source said: ''In our four years of existence, we have
learned enough to be able to do more with less. We are not going to the
Government to demand more and more. We want the Government to recognise
that we can make a pound sweat and do more.''
Scottish Enterprise's budget has remained almost static in cash terms
over the last four years and has fallen in real terms. In 1992-3, it
stood at #449m; it rose to #451m by last year and, in this year, has
fallen back slightly to #450m -- excluding European Union and other
contributions.
A 15%, #68m cut, the largest by far, would be on a scale that could
have potentially far-reaching consequences for the network's
performance, both as a provider of strategy and as a deliverer of
services, in particular its successful Training for Work programme.
SE sources, however, are confident of its ability to maintain its
performance. ''We've got the system up and running. We've got it
delivering the outputs throughout Scotland,'' one source said.
He added: ''For the first time in living memory, Scotland is not at
the bottom of the league in terms of unemployment and investment. It's
well ahead of England and Wales.''
SE's fate will be decided in the Ministerial public expenditure round
in advance of the November Budget. Although initial indications will be
available by then, formal confirmation of SE's budgetary fate will come
in January.
Labour's Scottish front- bench spokesman, Mr John McFall, last night
criticised the prospect of cuts for their potential effect on the
Scottish economy: ''The economy is almost on its knees at the moment so
how can we deliver economic prosperity, jobs, and training with such a
savage cut. It can't be done.
''It is incumbent on Professor MacKay to confront Mr Forsyth with the
Government lie: this shows that the Government is not interested in
people or jobs.''

IT now seems likely that Skye and Lochalsh District Council will ask
its councillors and employees to boycott the official opening of the
Skye Bridge by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth on October 16.
A special meeting of the council has been called for Monday, in
Portree, when a motion asking for the boycott is the sole item of
business.
It has been requested by three councillors ''in protest at the failure
of Skye Bridge Ltd, Miller Dywidag, or the Scottish Office to enter into
meaningful local consultations on the operation of the toll structure of
the bridge''.
Council chairman John Farquhar Munro, who is also a member of Highland
Regional Council and the new single-tier Highland Council, told The
Herald last night: ''I think the vote will be unanimous. Having talked
to members, they seem firmly of the view that we should make this
protest.
''Our position as a council was to support the concept of a bridge to
Skye, subject to satisfactory negotiations on the question of tolls.
Despite repeated requests to the Scottish Office, we have yet to be
granted an audience.''
One of the councillors who has requested the meeting, Mr Allan Beaton,
whose Duirinish ward covers much of north-west Skye, said: ''There has
been no attempt to have any genuine consultation with local people on
the level of the tolls. It has been an imposition from day one. I think
feelings are running high and I would hope there will be complete
support for this motion.''
The council move follows the boycott call made last week by the Skye
Bridge Appeal Group. Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy,
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald, and Labour's front-bench spokesman
Brian Wilson have indicated they will join the boycott.
Mr Kennedy said last night: ''I have now received my invitation but I
can confirm I will be otherwise engaged on that day.''
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, said
last night she was delighted by the news of the special meeting.
''I would hope that every councillor would take this opportunity to
make this small protest against the imposition of a high toll monopoly
bridge on the people of Skye and the Western Isles.
''I would also call on others invited to attend to consider whether
they might do likewise.''

<HEADLINE>Gay stockbroker stole from charity, jury told</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976060685</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A GAY stockbroker stole #3m worth of shares from the British Heart
Foundation after fleecing his father of his savings, a court heard
yesterday.
Behind the fraud lay allegations that Mr Jeremy Gray, 27, was helped
by a Dutch ''homosexual ring'' in laundering the money through foreign
bank accounts, it is alleged.
But when he was arrested Mr Gray, claimed the same foreign
''drug-running criminals'' forced him into dishonesty while he worked as
a stockbroker in the City of London.
Outlining Mr Gray's defence, his lawyer Mr Peter Thornton, QC, told
the Snaresbrook Crown Court jury the truth was ''more bizarre than
fiction'' during a story of death threats from drug-runners, the IRA,
and even the Mafia.
Prosecutor Mr Nigel Seed alleges that Mr Gray simply stole money from
the charity and laundered the funds. Before doing so, he told his bosses
that he was HIV positive.
Mr Seed said: ''First the defendant stole from his father Dr Gray, who
had #55,000 worth of stock. The proceeds were transferred abroad to
Luxembourg and to an associate there by the name of Richard Macauley
Crofts.
''The second client was the British Heart Foundation, a charity which
had a large amount of investments with his firm Panmure Gordon, and he
effectively stole #3m worth of its American investment.''
By the time the police caught up with Mr Gray, the money had been
dispersed through various accounts in Denmark, Holland, and Austria, it
is alleged.
What Mr Gray did, it is alleged, was to sell stock held by BHF, via
Barclays Bank in New York, in companies including air giants Boeing,
Dupont, and the racing team Williams.
He then transferred the shares to a US financial institution before
they were moved over to various accounts and ''sub-accounts'' held with
the Swiss Banking Corps, the jury heard.
Mr Gray's father then discovered the loss of his treasury stock and
his son's Swiss bank accounts, containing $2.4m, were frozen.
Mr Seed said that, in September 1994, Gray was penniless in Dublin
when he spoke to a relative claiming he had been threatened by Crofts.
''He went on to speak of drug-running in Bosnia and his fears for his
life at the hands of the British Secret Services, the Italian Mafia, and
the IRA.''
Mr Gray, of Clapham, south London, denies three counts of theft, two
of false accounting, two of producing a false accounting document, one
of handling stolen goods and one of making a false statement to procure
a passport.
The trial continues.

FOR 320 years, the elaborate suit worn by the future King James II of
England (James VII of Scotland) at the wedding to his 14-year-old Roman
Catholic bride has remained hidden from the public gaze.
Now the richly-embroidered ''exceptional and unique'' outfit has come
out of storage and is expected to fetch up to #300,000 at a Sothebys
auction in London next month.
The breeches and light brown woollen coat, lined with coral pink silk,
kept out the chill autumn winds as the then Duke of York waited at Dover
for the arrival of Mary Beatrice d'Este, daughter of the Duke of Modena,
on November 21, 1673.
After the low-key wedding, the Duke gave the suit to Sir Edward
Carteret, a close friend whose family had remained loyal after the
execution of his father, Charles I.
After Sir Edward's death, the suit passed to his widow and then to her
sister, Anne Durrell, later wife of Matthew de Sausmarez, in whose
family it has remained ever since at Sausmarez Manor on Guernsey.

SCOTLAND'S new single-tier councils are to be urged to put housing at
the top of their agenda and to look at ways of getting more private
finance into tackling homelessness.
The director of the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland, Mr
Alan Ferguson, who is to address a conference in Edinburgh today, said
yesterday that the problems of how to channel investment into housing
and best provide for those in housing need would not disappear after
local government reorganisation.
''There is a need for the new authorities to examine creatively routes
to get private finance into housing,'' he stressed.
The conference, organised by Shelter, the Chartered Institute, and
Cosla, will also hear Scottish Office Minister Raymond Robertson make
his first major speech on housing.
In a letter to the housing charity Shelter this week, the Minister
said the Government's private finance initiative offered significant
opportunities for using private skills and resources to meet public
needs.
Shelter's depute director of housing services Ms Mary Thomson will
tell delegates that there has been little discussion about housing's
role within the new councils even though tackling homelessness will be a
major responsibility.
The debate is taking place against a background of fresh Government
moves to get tough with homeless people. In a consultation paper due to
be published today, Ministers seek to enlist the help of the voluntary
sector.
Ministers want hostels, police, and other agencies to do more to get
drunks and beggars off the streets.
Details of the proposals are revealed in the 70-page consultation
document.

TRADE and cultural links between a Scottish port and a Japanese city
are set to be revitalised -- thanks to Madame Butterfly.
After decades of research, it has been proved that Puccini's tragic
opera was based on the life of Tsuru, the wife of the Aberdeen-educated
Thomas Blake Glover.
Glover, who is credited with being the founder of modern Japan and the
massive Mitsubishi organisation, is revered in his adopted country but
hardly recognised in his native land.
However, that is set to change with the visit to the north of Scotland
by Ms Kazudo Noda, the great-great- granddaughter of the former Geisha
girl, Tsuru.
Ms Noda, 45, has foregone marriage to devote her life to proving that
Tsuru, who always wore the emblem of a butterfly on her clothes, was the
model for Madame Butterfly, the heroine of the classic love story. She
has continued with research started by her father, who died in 1980, to
solve the mystery conclusively.
''At last, we can say that Tsuru was the original model on which the
story is based,'' she said yesterday.
Ms Noda hopes her five-day visit will endorse efforts being made to
revitalise the links between Aberdeen and Nagasaki. She has already
visited Braehead House, in Aberdeen, where Glover was raised and where
Grampian Regional Council hopes to develop a centre for cultural
studies.
Grampian's convener, Mrs Rhona Kemp, said: ''Before the Second World
War, there were very close ties between the two ports. It is our aim to
rejuvenate these and bring both Japanese tourists and business people to
the area through the Glover name.''
In the mid-1800s, Glover, a merchant, took vessels from Aberdeen's
famous boatyards to found the Japanese navy and helped fleeing Samurai
youths gain an education in Scotland.
Tsuru, who divorced her first husband at the age of 17, later married
Glover, who became the first foreigner to be awarded Japan's highest
honour, the Order of the Rising Sun.

IT could happen only to ScotRail. Having triumphantly reopened the
flooded Argyle line, the company has found itself in hot water over a
33% cut in fares.
The cut was introduced to mark the reopening of the line on September
24 and offered a one-third discount to customers buying tickets for
journeys starting or finishing at any Argyle line station east of
Bridgeton (Dalmarnock, Rutherglen, and Bridgeton itself) until October
7.
However, it was claimed last night that ScotRail staff have been
threatened with disciplinary action for advising customers how to make
the most of the offer.
A ScotRail staff member -- who must remain anonymous for fear of what
he called the company's ''draconian attitude to its staff speaking
publicly'' -- told The Herald: ''Ticket issuing staff have been advising
customers who may be only travelling as far as Glasgow from stations in
Ayrshire, for example, to purchase tickets to Bridgeton instead.
''This has enabled some passengers to obtain savings of more than #350
on an annual season ticket which is perfectly within the terms of the
offer.
''However, these same staff are now being threatened with disciplinary
action for advising customers on how to save money.''
He added: ''It has always been the case that ScotRail staff are
obliged to issue the cheapest ticket for the journey being undertaken.
It would seem to me that ScotRail has made yet another almighty blunder
and is now back-tracking on its own special offer by denying its
customers the opportunity to save some money.''
Last night, The Herald telephoned ScotRail inquiries on 0345-212282 to
check the price of an annual ticket from Ayr to Glasgow. It costs #1204.
When asked the cost of a similar ticket from Ayr to Bridgeton, the phone
went dead on two occasions.
At the third attempt, we were told it would cost #1204. When reminded
of the Argyle line offer the ScotRail employee said: ''Oh yes, I forgot
about that. The price is #806.70.''
The divisional organiser of the Rail, Maritime, and Transport Union,
Mr Phil McGarry, said ScotRail had dropped a clanger. ''I do not think
the marketing initiative has been thought out. It is disgraceful they
are threatening staff who are trying to help customers by telling them
the cheapest way to travel. That is good customer care on the staff side
and enhances ScotRail's image.''
A ScotRail spokesman said last night: ''No-one has been threatened.
Staff were encouraged to sell the cheapest tickets but not on journeys
that were not in the spirit of the Argyle line offer. That offer was a
thank you to people who travel on the Argyle line.''
He added: ''People have discovered a loophole but we are not going to
promote a loophole which is not in the spirit of the offer.''

MRS Rosemary West yesterday came face to face with the jury of eight
men and four women who will decide whether she murdered 10 young women
or girls, whose dismembered bodies were recovered from houses in which
she lived.
It took a mere 15 minutes to empanel the jury at Winchester Crown
Court.
Not one person whose name was called for jury duty took advantage of
an offer made by the trial judge to put forward a reason he or she might
be excused.
Throughout, Mrs West, a mother of seven, sitting between female prison
officers in the dock, was paying particular attention to the jury. Her
gaze seldom left them.
Mr Justice Mantell told jury members they must distance themselves
from anything they may previously have read or heard about the case.
''You must put out of your mind any preconception, any prejudice, or
any sentiment. You must banish such thoughts from your mind,'' he told
the jury.
The case undoubtedly did have sensational aspects, the judge said.
It had received a certain amount of publicity and it was going to
receive more. However, each one of them had taken an oath or an
affirmation that they would try the case on the evidence.
The evidence was what they would hear in court.
The judge said he could not bar them from watching television or
reading newspapers but what they read in the press or saw on their
screens was not evidence, he said.
''You try the case -- nobody else does,'' he said.
He advised them to do everything in their power to prevent anyone
talking to them about it.
The chief danger would come when they returned home.
They were perfectly entitled to tell family members that they were on
the jury trying Mrs Rosemary West on these 10 charges.
''Beyond that, you should say nothing,'' the judge said.
He then told the jury that it was unlikely they would be required to
return to court before Friday.
''Go with a warning I have given about not discussing the case ringing
in your ears,'' he declared.
The trial is expected to last up to eight weeks but the court will not
sit today.
Jewish lawyers, including Crown prosecuting counsel, Mr Brian Leveson,
QC, will be observing the solemn day of Yom Kippur. Additionally, the
Winchester judges will carry out ceremonies to mark the start of the
legal year.
Legal teams will return to court tomorrow when the judge will give his
ruling on various legal points.
The most remarkable event concerning the trial yesterday was the
apparent total lack of interest being taken in the case by the local
population.
Streets were cordoned off as Mrs West was transported the short
distance from the local prison to the Crown Court. Three police
motorcycles headed a convoy.
A helicopter carrying a television film crew arrived overhead three
minutes later and failed to capture the event.
Last night, they turned up long before she was due to leave court on
the return journey to prison, to ensure the same mistake was not
repeated.
The only locals who seemed to be taking any kind of interest were
those who happened to be on the streets. They merely interrupted their
journey to witness the events taking place in front of them.
It was not at all what the media had anticipated and they soon began
to interview each other.

<TEXT>
PREGNANT servicewomen are to be provided with specially designed
maternity wear as part of their uniform.
Expectant mothers serving in the armed forces will be issued with
seven items of maternity wear from February, to prevent them having to
revert to civilian wear in the later stages of pregnancy.
A spokeswoman for the MoD said the new uniforms, designed by
Leeds-based firm Dewhirst (Uniforms), would be issued in airforce blue
for the RAF, navy blue for the Royal Navy, and green for Army
servicewomen.
It is the latest move by defence chiefs to cater for pregnant
servicewomen, after they were first allowed to remain in the forces in
1990.
The MoD will issue the new seven-piece boxed set to expectant
servicewomen as soon as it is learned they are pregnant and mothers will
be able to keep their special uniforms for future pregnancies.
Women in the forces had said the conventional uniform was fine for the
first months of pregnancy but had asked for the maternity wear ''to keep
their identity as servicewomen when pregnant, rather than having to
revert to civilian clothing'', the spokeswoman said.
The MoD faces compensation claims from many servicewomen forced to
leave the armed forces after becoming pregnant before the rules were
changed in 1990.
Up to 5000 claims were expected after it was ruled the MoD had
contravened European law, and around 3500 have so far been completed.

<HEADLINE>Lack of orders forces Yarrow to diversify</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976060700</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Clydeside warship builder, Yarrow, has given notice of its
intention to diversify by advertising for a dedicated team of commercial
shipbuilding executives.
The company, which last month announced 415 redundancies because of a
dearth of naval orders, has advertised in the national press for a
commercial shipbuilding marketing manager, marine design engineers, and
commercial estimators.
The advertisements say that Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd -- which has built
warships for 130 years, but competed in the commercial market at regular
intervals until 1967 -- ''is now set to expand its operations into the
commercial marine market, including specialist marine vessels''.
Management says the creation of a ''dedicated small commercial
shipbuilding team'' is necessary to secure both UK and overseas orders
and preserve skills and continuity of employment at the Scotstoun yard.
A spokesman said yesterday: ''We are making a move now to broaden our
product base. There are fewer naval orders around with the peace
dividend.''
The next few months will be crucial for the yard, which is pinning its
hopes on securing a multi-million-pound contract to build three more
Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy, an order which in turn could help
to attract more overseas business, vital for Yarrow's future.
Management and unions had hoped that the Ministry of Defence might
bring the order forward to try to prevent the 415 redundancies, which
affected mainly steel workers.
However, the MoD has confirmed that an announcement is unlikely before
December, which will be too little and too late to avoid redundancies
among the workforce of 3100.
Mr Murray Easton, Yarrow's managing director, has said there would be
no more redundancies this year, but said existing work in the order book
would run out in February, 1997. He warned of further redundancies, if
the yard was not successful in persuading customers to place work.
The management spokesman revealed that Yarrow's had submitted
''various tenders of various descriptions'' over the years for
commercial marine work but had failed to secure the business.
He refused to confirm whether any contracts had been lined up, but
added: ''Our commercial shipbuilding team will target the UK and
overseas market and look at any potential job, no matter its size, and
treat it on its merits.''
Mr Dougie Conroy, shop stewards' convener at the yard, said it was
vital for Yarrow's to break through into the foreign market by securing
either commercial marine or naval orders.
''That is the only guarantee of future employment here,'' he said.
''We can't go on indefinitely relying on Royal Navy business.''

Accused launched vicious attacks on three homosexual men in park in
the one night.
FOUR accused, one a 14-year-old girl, were sentenced to life yesterday
at the High Court in Glasgow for beating a man to death and attacking
others.
They picked on homosexual men in Queen's Park, Glasgow. In one night,
they attacked three, killing one.
The murder victim was Mr Michael Doran, 35. He was left dying, his
face and skull smashed.
Midway through the trial, Richard Bell, 20, and Richard Ferguson, 16,
both of Tarfside Oval, South Cardonald, Glasgow, changed their pleas and
admitted the murder and assault charges on June 2.
This left John Cairns, 18, of Shawholm Terrace, Shawlands, Glasgow,
with his girlfriend, Claire Codona, 14, of Hillhead Avenue, Blairbeth,
Glasgow, a pupil at Shawlands Academy, facing the charges.
The jury found them both guilty of murdering Mr Doran, of Allison
Street, Govanhill, Glasgow. Cairns was also found guilty of the two
other assault charges.
A fifth accused, James Knox, 20, of Langside Road, Govanhill, was
found guilty of one assault and was ordered to be detained for two and a
half years.
Lord Morison lifted reporting restrictions which had prevented the
girl's identity being revealed during the trial. The judge said it was
in the public interest that she should be named.
When the verdict was announced, Codona's mother screamed: ''No, no.
She never done it.''
During the trial Mr Colin Boyd, QC, prosecuting, described Queen's
Park as a favourite place for homosexual men meeting after dark.
The first two men assaulted were kicked, punched and threatened with a
knife before being robbed, and were left dazed and bleeding.
Then they ambushed Mr Doran.
He was stabbed several times as he lay on the ground.
The gang then stamped and jumped on his head and face before tearing
off his jacket and running away.
He was found by two policemen investigating one of the other attacks
after they heard gurgling noises coming from the bushes.
Every bone in his face and skull was fractured and he had severe brain
damage. Mr Doran died soon after he was taken to hospital.
The three youths, their clothes still covered with Mr Doran's blood,
then gatecrashed a party in Pollokshaws Road and boasted about what they
had done.
By that time Claire Codona had gone home, but she was arrested next
day in a flat where Cairns was staying.
During the trial her defence counsel, Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, claimed
she had been pressed for hours by two policewomen into finally admitting
that she had kicked Mr Doran ''once on the foot'', but she consistently
denied everything else.
Mr Jackson also pointed out that the only other person present during
the long interrogation was the girl's father, described in court by a
psychiatrist as a chronic alcoholic, incapable of safeguarding his
daughter's interest.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, told the court that Bell hated homosexuals
after two years of abuse by a neighbour when he was a boy.
The murder was similar to an incident in the same park which shocked
Scotland in 1960. Mr James Cremlin, 48, was battered to death for #67 by
Antony Millar, 19, the last man to be hanged in Barlinnie Prison.
Yesterday, Mr Doran's sister Mrs Sandra Hepburn, 28, of Torrance,
Stirlingshire, said: ''These monsters should be dangling from the end of
a rope too for what they did to our Michael.''
She added : ''I just don't know how people can be so violent.
''We had to identify my brother in the mortuary. It was horrible. His
face was unrecognisable and the only way we could tell it was him was a
burn at the top of his chest.''
She went on: ''They picked on my brother because he was gay and they
did it for for the pure fun of it.''
Sentencing the gang Lord Morison described the offences as vicious and
cowardly attacks. He said he was refraining from ordering a minimum
sentence because of the ages of the accused and the fact they had no
previous convictions for violence.

AGENTS handling the sale of 139 British Coal properties in Scotland,
were confident of selling all of them without difficulty, it was claimed
in Edinburgh yesterday.
Mr John Brown, the director of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, who is
co-ordinating the sale, said it would be ''very, very disappointing
indeed'' if buyers had not been found for everything by November 17, the
closing date for tenders.
''We don't expect anything to be left for sale after that date,'' he
added.
Mr Brown said he anticipated a great deal of interest in the
portfolio, which contained some unusual properties, and a lot of
potential.
The properties, which cover 1688 acres, are located mainly in Lothian,
Fife, Strathclyde, and Central regions. They cover former colliery
sites, tenanted and vacant houses, other buildings, agricultural land,
and two slag heaps.
The portfolio, which has been arranged into six lots, is the first put
on the market in Scotland since the sell-off of British Coal's
non-operational property assets was announced earlier this year.
The slag heaps are at Cronberry, near Cumnock, and Dunaskin,
Waterside, both Ayrshire, and are expected to be attractive to
contractors for roadbuilding. There are also 11 sites which were used
for tipping of waste from coal mining, mainly in Lothian and
Strathclyde.
Mr Brown said British Coal had taken steps to ensure it could share in
benefits obtained by the purchaser arising from enhanced performance of
certain properties. This was the provision known as ''clawback'' and
would prevent purchasers from ''making a super-profit''.
Asked about the price expected from the sale, Mr Brown refused to
quote figures. He said negotiations would be by way of tender.
Mr David Wenn, British Coal's head of property division, said the sale
of property in Scotland had become possible ahead of England, because
England was larger and the presentation of lots was still being
considered.
The properties include a 14.5-acre site of former market gardens at
Carluke, Lanarkshire; 29 acres of mainly agricultural grazings at
Sanderson's Wynd, Tranent, East Lothian; and 67 acres of agricultural
land at Wallyford, Midlothian.
Others include a former mineral line at Kelty, Fife.

MOLLIE Harris, for 25 years the voice of Martha Woodford in The
Archers, died yesterday, aged 82.
She passed away at Sir Michael Sobell House in the Oxford Radcliffe
Hospital after suffering from cancer for some time, said a BBC
spokesman.
As she worked behind the counter of the village shop, Martha Woodford,
with her gentle rural accent and gossiping ways, was one of Ambridge's
central characters.
Listeners last heard her only a month ago in an episode recorded about
a month before that.
Before she joined the Archers in 1970, Mollie Harris wrote and
presented rural programmes, including In The Country and The Countryside
. . . Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
Mr Michael Green, controller of BBC Radio 4, said: ''The voice of
Mollie Harris was part of daily life for a generation of Archers
listeners. She will be sadly missed by millions of fans.''
The Archers' editor, Vanessa Whitburn, said: ''I loved working with
Mollie. She brought a vibrancy and humour to the character of Martha
Woodford and, using her own rich Oxfordshire background, she helped to
create one of the most memorable country characters in British
broadcasting history. We will all miss her very much.''
Golden-hearted but gossipy and not as quick as she used to be, Martha
Woodford as depicted by Mollie Harris was a vital part of the Ambridge
community.
After her husband, Joby, died, Martha had dalliances with Joe Grundy,
Bill Insley, and Colonel Danby.
Mollie Harris wrote more than a dozen books about The Archers and
country life. Her husband, ''Ginger'', died eight years ago. She leaves
a son, Peter, two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE>Council decides on legal move over chessman</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976060705</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Isles councillors have decided to return the Lewis chessmen to
the British Museum, defeating a move to temporarily ''hijack'' the ivory
chess pieces, found on a beach at Uig on the west of the island 160
years ago.
The council's arts and leisure committee decided instead to let the
relevant authorities know that it felt the pieces should be returned to
the Western Isles permanently, meet the British Museum trustees to put
its case, and seek legal clarification on ownership of the chessmen.
The pieces, insured for #3m, have been on display at the #900,000
Western Isles museum, which opened in July.
An agreeement was entered into with the British Museum, and museum
staff and security people are due to arrive on Stornoway next Monday to
remove the pieces for another exhibition in Edinburgh starting on
October 12.
The chessmen have proved a great attraction since they went on display
in Museum nan Eilean, Stornoway, with 1500 visitors per week during July
and August.
Hundreds of chess enthusiasts visited the island for a grandmasters'
tournament held to coincide with the opening of the museum.
Councillor Alasdair Nicholson moved that the council re-iterate its
stance that the Lewis Chessmen, as part of the heritage and cultural
inheritance of the Western Isles, should remain on permanent display in
the islands.
He said that negotiations should continue with the British Museum to
seek a mutually satisfactory outcome by way of permanent loan and that
the council should continue to offer to house the Uig chess collection
while such discussions are under way.
Leader of the five-strong Labour group on the council, Mr Callum Iain
Macmillan, who seconded him, said that there was overwhelming support in
the community for the pieces to be kept on the island.
He said: ''If they go back, there is no undertaking that they will
ever return. We may be looking at another 160 yers before we get them
back.'' However, the convener, Councillor Donald Mackay, moved that the
council comply with its agreement while making its case.
Director of Education Neil Galbraith, told the committee that he had
already written to the British Museum trustees expressing the council's
views, and had been informed that the request would come before a
meeting of the trustees on November 4.
Councillor Donald Maclean said that, while he felt that the rightful
place for the Lewis chessmen was in the island, added: ''However, we
should not delay by one day or by one hour their return and breach our
legal agreeent. If we are seen to be breaking a legally binding
agreement, we will not be trusted by anyone else. Let us not break a
legal agreement.''

AN entire boys football team was sent off after the 12-year-old
players sang a dirty song about the referee.
A flurry of four-letter words and raucous songs greeted referee Gerry
Cullen as he walked into the dressing room after a Sunday league match
between two under-13 year old teams.
Within seconds, Mr Cullen ordered them off -- even though the game had
finished five minutes earlier.
He marched up to each player as they changed out of their white soccer
strip and showed them a red card -- indicating that they had been
officially suspended from the game.
The boys from the Under-13's junior team at Crowmarsh, Oxfordshire,
pitched in with their insults after Mr Cullen sent off goalkeeper Arron
Baker during an away match against Littlemoor. He even showed the red
card to some parents who tried to remonstrate from the touchline.
The teams played on and Crowmarsh won 2-1.
Mr Alan Wright, whose son Matthew plays centre-half for Crowmarsh,
said the boys couldn't believe it when the referee sent them all off.
''They thought it was a joke -- it was like a scene out of a comedy. A
man in his 40s walking among a bunch 12-year-old boys brandishing a
yellow then a red card in front of each of them.
''He was acting like it was the Premier League when it was only Sunday
football with kids of 12. I have never seen a referee behave like it.
''It's very rare at that standard of football for boys to be shown a
card at all -- let alone all be sent off. It was totally over the top.''
Another parent said: ''It was incredible. One chap, who had only been
passing by and stopped to watch a few minutes of the match, was given
the red card because he said the ref got his just desserts. It was utter
chaos.''
The boys play in the Beeline Oxfordshire Boys Sunday League, which is
affiliated to the Football Association and they face disciplinary action
from the FA for allegedly bringing the game into disrepute.
Mr David Hovard, disciplinary secretary of the Oxfordshire area of the
FA, said that a report on the incident was awaited from Mr Cullen.

IT'S the face of a stranger yet strikingly familiar, a flesh and bone
version of countless grainy newsprint images.
In the harsh yellow light of Court No 3, Rosemary West looks pale,
with only faint splashes of colour on either cheek. She is barely
visible in the high-sided dock, just her head with its blunt cut of
thick dark hair and squarish glasses which occasionally slip down her
nose as she leans forward to survey the court.
She's wearing earrings -- long, dangly, and filigreed -- and when she
finally stands as the court breaks for lunch, her heavy-set figure is
hidden in a dark navy jacket and green waistcoat over a bright white
shirt.
On either side, two young female warders sit impassively,
occasionally, like West, slipping mints into their mouths and sucking
quietly.
She glances frequently at the newly empanelled jury of eight men and
four women as the judge, Mr Justice Mantell, warns them in his rich
baritone about sharing details of the case, before sending them off.
None of them glance her way.
During legal arguments she listens intently, leaning forward in her
seat and rocking gently back and forwards, eyes bright behind lenses,
and flicking between the lead counsel for the prosecution, Brian
Leveson, QC, and her own defence team. She smiles only once when her
solicitor, Leo Goatley, leaves his seat and slips briefly past her and
out of the courtroom.
The curious stares of the press pack, squashed into two separate
seating blocks, she meets head-on. Opposite her, some 20ft away, Judge
Mantell sits under a high wooden canopy in a large red leather chair --
the bewigged legal teams and their ranks of assistants squashed into
three rows in front of him, half hidden in a forest of thick files,
heavy legal text books and laptop computers. In another corner court
artists scribble frantically, eyes darting between West and the other
court players.
Directly above the dock and completely out of West's line of vision,
faces peer through the glass partition of the small public gallery --
one elderly man craning his neck to try unsuccessfully to see the
accused.
If she could see what was above her she would know that only a handful
of people have turned out to watch the first day's proceedings. By 9am
only one woman was queuing outside the court and an hour later only 13
of the 50 seats had been filled -- mostly by members of the press. Court
officials admitted they were puzzled at the low turnout and said that
the seats set aside for West's relatives and those of her alleged
victims had apparently remained empty.
Outside the court, a few pockets of passers-by had gathered to watch
her arrive in a speeding white van, a blur of half-glimpsed forms behind
smoky windows. There were no shouts, no hurled abuse, no voices at all
-- only the rattle of camera shutters and the trample of journalists'
feet as they jostled to try for a better view.
Police, drafted in to set out barriers, said they thought that there
would be a bigger public reaction and turnout when the evidence in the
case -- expected to be particularly gruesome -- began at the end of the
week.
''I'm really surprised at how few people have turned up for this,''
said Mrs Lyn Reynolds, 43, a local resident who had pressed herself into
a shop door to watch the proceedings. ''We were expected a heck of a lot
of people and we didn't think we'd get a place, but Winchester is a bit
like that, we don't want to let on that we're interested in something. I
don't suppose I'm going to see anything. I mean she's not going to be
waving out of the window or anything, is she?''
Winchester does indeed appear to be turning a blind eye to the whole
affair and most residents are keen to play down the economic windfall as
hordes of reporters descend on hotels and hostelries. More than 150
British and foreign journalists have applied for accreditation for the
case.
''Come to wave at Rosie, have you?'' asks one taxi driver at the
station. ''I tell you, it's good news for the business. We're getting
#2.50 to whisk you round this little one-way system.''
One enterprising restaurant owner was ready outside the court
mid-morning to pass out details of his eaterie. ''Great! Our very own
canteen,'' said one reporter. ''Exactly,'' said the man.
Earlier one smartly dressed elderly woman with a bright leather
handbag made her way almost unnoticed past the media ranks to claim a
seat in the public gallery. ''I just want to see her,'' she said, ''see
what she looks like.'' She was informed that she would not be able to
look into the dock from the public gallery and her face fell. ''Well, I
want to go in anyway -- just to be there. It's a little bit of history
here, isn't it?''

O J Simpson vowed last night to dedicate his life to tracking down the
real killers of his ex-wife and a friend. The former football star had
just been acquitted of double-murder.
Nearly 16 months after his arrest and less than an hour after the not
guilty verdicts were read to a hushed courtroom, Simpson was released
and issued a statement expressing relief that ''this part of the
incredible nightmare . . . is over''.
He then returned to his mansion in the exclusive Los Angeles suburb
where he was arrested on June 17, last year after a bizarre highway
chase, seen on televison throughout the world.
He was greeted by his friend Al Cowlings, the man who drove Simpson's
vehicle that day followed by dozens of police cars.
His trial had transfixed America and fascinated the world.
At the end of it, the jury took less then four hours to reach a
decision. It was kept secret overnight at the judge's order.
A court clerk then read the not guilty verdicts to a hushed courtroom
as crowds massed outside and millions of TV viewers looked on from
around the world.
Simpson, 48, sportsman turned film actor, who had become the most
famous murder defendant in US history, smiled with relief, patted his
hand over his heart, and hugged his leading attorney, Mr Johnnie
Cochran.
Relatives of victims Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and Ron Goldman, 25, at
first seemed unable to believe the verdict, then sobbed as they realised
Simpson was going free.
0 The prosecution team were at first stunned and later there were
tears of anger and frustration at a news conference.
District Attorney Gil Garcetti said: ''There are going to be people
who are doubting the criminal justice system. We are profoundly
disappointed with the verdict.''
Mr Fred Goldman, father of victim Ron Goldman, said: ''This
prosecution team did not lose today. I deeply believe that this country
lost today. Justice was not served.''
Mr Goldman added: ''Last June 13, 1994, was the worst nightmare of my
life. This is the second.''
It is possible the Goldman family will now try to reopen the case by
suing Simpson in civil court over the killing of their son.
A key defence witness, Kathleen Bell, who had given crucial testimony
about the racism of Mark Fuhrman, the former police detective at the
centre of the investigation, said: ''I feel awful. I just feel awful . .
. I think to hear the Goldman family cry was very difficult. I would
like to put it behind me. I don't know how I can apologise for that.''
Outside the courthouse, hundreds of Simpson supporters celebrated,
dancing and shaking hand-written signs in triumph.
However, many Americans expressed shock that the jurors had ignored
what prosecutors described as a ''mountain of evidence'' linking Simpson
to the crime.
The jubilant defence team issued a statement from Simpson, read out by
his son, Jason. It read: ''I am relieved that this part of the
incredible nightmare that occurred on June 12, 1994, is over.''
He said his first obligations were to his children, family and
friends, but went on: ''But when things have settled a bit, I will
pursue as my primary goal in life -- the killer or killers who
slaughtered Nicole and Mr Goldman.
''They are out there somewhere. Whatever it takes to identify them and
bring them in, I will provide somehow.
''I can only hope that some day despite every prejudicial thing that
has been said about me publicly, both in and out of the courtroom,
people will come to understand and believe that I would not, could not
and did not kill anyone.''
Jason said his father would have more to say later.
The acquittal means he may ask a court to give him guardianship of the
two young children he had with his ex-wife. Her parents, Lou and Juditha
Brown, were given guardianship of Sydney, nine, and Justin, seven, last
year after Simpson was charged.
Mr Cochran denied that he had used race to swing the votes of the
jurors. However, his closing arguments were all about race, and he
demanded that the jury (nine of whose members were black) defy the
white, racist police establishment, and send a message to white America
that it must end its racism.
The tactic was even criticised by one of the defence team, lawyer
Robert Shapiro. He said they had ''dealt the race card from the bottom
of the deck''. He was also angry with Mr Cochran for his comparison of
Fuhrman to Hitler and said he would not work with him again.
Outside the courtroom, police were on alert for possible trouble in
the streets in the event of a guilty verdict.
President Bill Clinton was among the first to react.
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Mr Clinton watched the verdict
on television and then wrote out the following statement:
''The jury heard the evidence and rendered its verdict. Our system of
justice requires respect for their decision. At this moment our thoughts
and prayers should be with the families of the victims of this terrible
crime.''
The trial involved about 120 witnesses, 45,000 pages of transcripts
and 1100 exhibits.
Prosecutors depicted the celebrity defendant as a man so obsessed with
his ex-wife that when he learned he could no longer control her, he
killed her in a rage. Mr Goldman was struck down, prosecutors said,
because he was ''in the wrong place at the wrong time''.
Simpson's defence team painted their client as the innocent victim of
a police evidence-planting conspiracy led by Fuhrman.
Simpson was staying in his mansion last night. He will reappear later,
to give his version of the past year and four months.
