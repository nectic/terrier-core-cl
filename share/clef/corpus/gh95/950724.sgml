FORMER Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke married his biographer,
Blanche d'Apulget, today as his former wife of 38 years, Hazel, marked
the occasion with a ''freedom party'' at the family home.
A crowd of reporters, gawkers, 30 Burmese student demonstrators, and a
group of people protesting against aircraft noise jostled outside as
Hawke and d'Alpuget exchanged vows at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the
upmarket Sydney suburb of Double Bay.
The newlyweds were rushed by the media as they emerged from the hotel
with guests, including Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley, and boarded a
double-decker bus for a short journey to a nearby Italian restaurant for
the reception.
''Did I cry?'' said Hawke, who has a reputation for being emotional.
''I had a couple of tears in my eyes, which Blanche said were very nice.
''But I had a new experience today, I started to water from the nose a
bit.''
Hawke, 65, met d'Alpuget, 51, at an embassy party in Jakarta in 1970
when she was married to an Australian diplomat and he was the head of a
trade union council.
A novelist, she wrote his biography in 1979.
Friends of Hazel Hawke said she was holding a ''freedom party'' to
show the world she was not a spurned wife but a woman who was happy that
the next stage of her life was beginning. The Hawkes' three children are
now adults.
Hawke, who lost the premiership to Paul Keating four years ago,
tearfully announced the end of his marriage to Hazel in November last
year. However he denied that his relationwhip with d'Alpuget, a priest
in training for the radical Independent Church of Australia, had ended
their marriage.--Reuter.

FLOODS caused by heavy monsoon rains have inundated vast areas in

houses.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ordered immediate relief for the victims
in districts of the provinces of Sindh, Baluchistan, and Punjab after
rains in the past few days.
No official estimate of the death toll was immediately available, but
local newspapers put the figures in hundreds in worst-hit districts of
Sindh and Baluchistan.
At least 100 people were reported dead in Johi village in Sindh's
western district of Dadu. As hundreds of other villages in the district
were affected, hundreds of others were feared dead or marooned.
Government officials confirmed at least 28 people had died in
Baluchistan, where the floods had cut off road and train links and
suspended traffic on the main road to Karachi.
In Punjab, several villages along the banks of the Chenab river have
been inundated. Television showed large flooded areas looking like lakes
with marooned people taking shelter on high ground.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
KASHMIRI militants holding five Western hostages, including two
Britons, today said one of the tourists was in a serious condition after
being wounded in a gun battle with Indian security forces on Friday.
The Al-faran group statement did not name the seriously wounded
hostage, nor say what his nationality was.
Besides Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan who were abducted near
Pahalgam, 55 miles from Srinagar, the group is holding a German, a
Norwegian, and an American.
''Indian forces tried to raid one of our secret hideouts at Kapran
near Anantnag when the hostages were there,'' said the Al-Faran
statement.
''Two hostages were injured in indiscriminate firing by the Indian
forces. The condition of one of them is serious,'' added the communique,
written in Urdu.
It said that if Indian forces continued to track the guerrillas, they
could not be responsible for the lives of the hostages.
Al-Faran said Indian forces had raided their hideouts at least five
times since they kidnapped the five Westerners nearly three weeks ago.
However the Indian Government denies Al-Faran's assertion that two
hostages were injured in a clash with Indian security forces. ''There
was no such incident. There was no encounter,'' an official spokesman
said.
A spokesman of the Jammu and Kashmir government said efforts were on
for the release of the hostages, but indicated that the two sides might
have reached another statelmate.
''There is nothing much happenning. It is a tricky situation, each
side trying to wear out the other. Our efforts are towards getting them
released,'' he said.
A Western diplomat, in Srinagar to oversee the hostage crisis, refused
to say anything on the fate of the hostages and their possible release.
The hostages' female partners, who left for New Delhi last Tuesday,
returned to Srinagar yesterday raising speculation that their menfolk
might soon be released by the shadowy Al-Faran group.
Al-Faran refused to extend beyond last Monday a deadline it had set
for India to say it would free 20 guerrillas Al-Faran wants in exchange
for the victims.
It threatened to kill the hostages any time after that, and warned
India against any rescue attempt.
India has repeatedly appealed to the captors to release the five on
humanitarian grounds, but officials say it will not bargain away
guerrillas to free the captives. Officially, it also denies any talks
with the captors.
Rebels have been waging a five-year-old war against New Delhi in the
state, mainly-Hindu India's only Muslim-majority province.
* Five people died and 10 were injured in a landmine blast yesterday
near Srinagar, marking the third big blast in Kashmir since the hostage
crisis began.
Seventeen people died in a blast at Jammu, the state's winter capital,
on Thursday and four at Pahalgam last Sunday.--Reuter.

JAPANESE Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama survived the thrashing of
his Socialist Party in upper house elections today to retain the backing
of his coalition partners as leader of the country.
Voters stayed away from the polls in record numbers, underscoring the
depth of apathy against politics that has built up in Japan after two
years of revolving-door governments and switching alliances.
Murayama is the country's fourth prime minister in two years and
today's House of Councillors election, although it could not directly
decide the prime minister's future, was regarded as a virtual referendum
on his leadership.
With the count complete, the Socialists found they had taken only 16
of the 126 seats at stake, losing two-thirds of its 41 seats and six
short of the goal Murayama had set.
Yet the result was enough for Murayama's partners, the long-ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the small Sakigake party, to declare
that the 71-year-old prime minister would remain in office.
LDP president and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said: ''He is full of
vigour.''--Reuter.

RELATIVES of people missing from a collapsed shopping centre continued
a violent protest today, setting fire to police trucks and exploding
about 100 gas canisters.
The 80 or so protesters, who took over the disaster site, demanded
that the city resume the search for 134 people missing since the mall
collapsed on June 29, killing 459 people and injuring 900 others.
Family members exploded a petrol drum and threw about 100 small gas
canisters into the fire, setting off a series of explosions. They also
set fire to two police vans.
Eight police officers were injured, none seriously.
The protesters, who had earlier thrown water bottles at Seoul Mayor
Cho Sun's car, dispersed after the city promised a meeting.
Today disaster relief headquarters resumed a limited search for
remains at the shopping centre, but found no bodies.
Officials said searches also would begin at a second dump site where
rubble from the collapse had been taken.
However the headquarters rejected the families' demand that the
missing be counted among the dead, allowing them to receive compensation
and other help.
The protest began yesterday when rescue workers packed up their tools
to leave, saying their job was done. Families blame sloppy rescue work
for the missing remains and are demanding that the mayor apologise.
Twenty-five partial sets of remains have been recovered so far from a
rubbish dump where rubble from the mall was taken. Families claim the
remains of many more victims could be buried in the rubbish.
* A powerful typhoon killed at least 13 South Koreans and left more
than two dozen missing today as it overturned ships and swept a bus into
the sea.
Nine people died and four were missing after 20ft waves carried the
bus away in the city of Yesoo.
Two ships collided in high waves only 200yd offshore from Pusan
harbour. One person was rescued, but six remained missing.
Typhoon Faye was expected to dump as much as 14in of rain in some
regions before veering east toward the Sea of Japan.--AP.

Superintendent Charles Calima, who led the raiding team, said
documents seized from Douglas showed that he was a lieutenant-commander
in the navy until 1976.
Early this month, President Fidel Ramos ordered a crackdown against
foreign ''sex traffickers'' after claims that Australian and other

as fronts for prostitution.
A group formed by women's rights organisations said the extent of
prostitution in Angeles was now twice that before 1991, when Angeles was
a rest-and-recreation centre for American servicemen.--AP.

SUSAN SMITH has been found guilty of murder, and may face the electric
chair, for drowning her two children in a lake nine months ago.
In a case that has rocked America, jurors deliberated for just 2[1/2]
hours before returning with the verdict late on Saturday night.
Now the nine-man, three-woman jury must decide whether Smith, 23, is
electrocuted or spends her life in prison. Smith would be only the
second woman put to death in the US since capital punishment was
reintroduced in 1976. The death penalty phase, which starts today, may
last as long as a week.
For the past 12 days, court-room testimony on the Gothic tale of
murder, adultery, and suicide has torn at the heart of Union, a tiny
Bible Belt community with a population of 10,000 in South Carolina's
poor hill country.
The case first shot to prominence in October when Smith tearfully lied
on national television that a black man had kidnapped Michael and Alex,
aged three and 14 months. Nine days later, she confessed that she had
strapped them into their seats in her Mazda car and let it roll into
deep water.
As the verdict was read in the cavernous white courtroom, Smith
trembled and cried softly. The jury could have found her guilty of
lesser charges of involuntary manslaughter, with a penalty of up to five
years in prison.
Her mother, Linda Russell, buried her face in her hands after the
verdict as Smith, plump, handcuffed, and wearing a dark suit, was led
away.
Across the aisle the defendant's former husband, David Smith, stood
quietly, a picture of his two dead sons sticking out of his shirt
pocket.
In the death penalty phase, the sequestered jurors will hear fresh
testimony on so-called aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors
to help determine Smith's fate. The prosecution will stress that the
victims were under 11 and that Smith took the life of more than one
person, two vital factors in state law. South Carolina puts more people
to death for its size than any other state.
In Smith's favour is her lack of criminal history and her mental
illness, or severe depression, say experts. The judge will also instruct
the jurors to weigh the testimony against their own experience and
judgment.
Less known is the impact on jurors of Smith's gender, race, and her
family's long history in the close-knit community. Most of those on
Death Row in the United States fit the criminal stereotype all too
easily -- they are poor black men. In contrast, Smith is white, grew up
in Union, was popular at high school, and had always worked locally.
Indeed her former teachers and relatives were among those attending the
trial.
Smith's upbringing was also exceedingly troubled. Her father shot
himself dead when she was seven. Her step-father -- a prominent
businessman, campaigner for right-wing Republican Pat Robertson, and
member of the Christian Coalition -- sexually abused Smith for years
when she was a teenager, but Smith's own mother convinced her to
withdraw criminal charges.
Against Smith is that a mother killing her children in cold blood is
seen as the most inhuman crime, especially in the ''family values''
Bible Belt. Astonishingly, the step-father's family is maintaining
publicly that it was the teenage Smith who manipulated the adult man
into sexually abusing her.
During the trial, prosecutors contended that Smith killed her sons to
eliminate an obstacle to a love affair. Defence lawyers said Smith, with
a history of emotional problems, had intended to kill herself too, but
backed out at the last minute.
In closing statements, both sides hammered hard at Smith's
all-important state of mind.
''She had her hands over her ears so she could not hear those babies
crying out her name,'' prosecutor Tommy Pope said, his voice rising,
''crying out for their father, asking for her to come back and save
them.''
''Was it evil? Was it wicked? Or was it reckless?'' defence lawyer
Judy Clarke asked. ''Evilness had nothing to do with this. Mental
illness, mental disorder, whatever you want to call it, had everything
to do with it.''
Outside, the hot streets were filled with onlookers as word spread of
the verdict. Smith's former neighbour Dot Frost had left the
Southern-style white courthouse in tears when the jury first retired.
''I don't want to see Susan get the death penalty. They should go get
the ones that hurt her. And they hurt her like hell,'' Frost said after
the verdict was announced. ''She loved those kids.''
For his part, David Smith rushed out into the humidity and held aloft
the photos of his two dead sons before he was whisked away in a car. He
has long and ardently called for the death penalty for his ex-wife.

HERIOT'S further tightened their grip on the championship as they
clocked up another resounding victory -- their tenth Ryden East League
win in as many games -- this time over Stenhousemuir at Goldenacre.
Professional Shahid Aslam was the player of the match with a century,
which he then followed up by taking seven wickets.
His stand with Ian McKinlay, who contributed 71, was worth 142 out of
a total of 264 for seven. That proved altogether too much for the
visitors, who folded at 135, Shahid's victims costing him only 34 runs.
At Barnton, Royal High's Manzoor Elahi also was in devasting form with
the ball. He had a hand in the dismissal of nine Corstorphine batsmen, a
catch and a run out complementing his seven wickets. Shahid Saeed (40)
and Asim Butt (39) were the main contributors to a vulnerable total of
160.
The early loss of Stewart Farquharson and Bob Thornton undermined
High's reply, and when Manzoor was clean bowled by Shahid, the target
looked beyond reach. However, an assured innings from Ayaz Gul, mature
beyond his years, brought the home side right back into contention. In
company with Zahid Ali, 63 were added in even time for the fifth wicket.
Gul fell to a diving mid-on catch by Shahid one short of what would have
been a well deserved half-century and the game was on a real knife edge.
Some harem-scarem batting by Nazeesh Hussain threatened to win it for
High until he was bowled by Majid Sharif. With nerves frayed, swift
conciliatory action by the umpires defused a momentary flare-up, and
High settled for the safety of a draw, the bulk of the points heading
back to Union Park.
There was a similarly close finish at Freuchie, where the home side
failed by 10 runs to overhaul Falkland's 205 for five, Cheany Pandya
again top-scoring, with 48. Freuchie, however, gained the better of the
draw.
More nervous tension was generated at Raeburn Place, where there was a
positive feast of runs, Grange rattling up 263 for five against
Watsonians before declaring after 48 overs.
Gordon McGurk continued his tremendous form with an undefeated 127,
featuring a 6 and sixteen 4s. His league average is currently in the 90s
and he enjoyed himself hugely, particularly in a partnership worth 57
with Alec Davies and then 58 with Roddy Smith, who hit a crisp
half-century.
But mercurial Watsonians had a shock in store for the homesters. Kenny
Scott collared the bowling from the start and although he fell three
short of the ton, he had set the momentum which his colleagues strove to
maintain.
John Pollard and skipper Keith Flannigan pinged the ball all over the
field as the scoreboard whirred unceasingly.

GEORGE Strachan admits quite happily to have been with West Lothian
for 40 years -- first as a player, and the past 10 as groundsman. So his
answer to a passing remark that ''the pitch seems to be giving away
quite a few wickets'' was worth noting.
''No. It's the batsmen who are doing that.''
Trying to analyse such a polite statement of fact suddenly became easy
as Caley 80/- Counties League Leaders Strathmore showed a batting
death-wish -- with two or three exceptions -- and lost not only the
match by seven wickets, but their place at the top of the table.
The statistics surrounding the Strathie innings also makes strange
reading -- Nigel Hazel, with a superb 57 including eight 4s, Mark
Kelaher with 33, including only three 4s, and Scotland internationalist
Kevin Thomson with 23, which included four boundaries.
They were sitting reasonably comfortable on 78 for two, and yet it
seemed that within no time at all they were on 140 for nine after 50
overs, at which point Strathmore declared, hoping that a similar batting
fate would befall their opponents.
Former West Lothian captain David Orr soon disabused them of that. He
replaced Sanjay Patel as opener to partner Willie Donald, smashed a
belligerent 50 off 46 deliveries, which included nine 4s, and went on to
make 72 -- and that also included two 6s in Strathmore professional
Steve Atkinson's first over.
Donald, who had made three half-centuries in a row, had a rare
failure, being caught by Atkinson off Andy Monteith's bowling for six.
But Patel, coming in at No.3, kept up his excellent form, before being
caught by Thomson off Atkinson's bowling for 47. The Strathie pro,
incidentally, eventually got his revenge for Orr's treatment by claiming
his wicket.
It was a relatively early night as West Lothian reached a winning 142
for three.
But what of the bowling. The Strathmore batsman fell to the gentle
pace of former West Lothian skipper Gordon Hollins, who took four for
28, and the wiles of pro Ian Beven, with three for 49.
The question of whether or not West Lothian can still challenge for
the title when they are sitting in seventh place at the moment is still
open to debate because of the closeness at the top. Orr, at 31 and in
his fourth year at Boghall reckons not, although he did add: ''The games
we have lost have been tight affairs and although I don't think we will
win the championship, a place in the top three definitely is possible.
And we will cause problems to the top teams on the way.''
The Boghall encounter also sets up an intriguing Caley 80/- Counties
Cup final on Sunday on Strathmore's home patch at Lochside Park. When
West Lothian visited there at the end of May, Ian Beven's five for 41
was not enough to stave off a three-wicket defeat.
Now it's honours even, and as Orr said: ''Lochside is a smashing
ground, and there's usually a good crowd of spectators to add a bit of
atmosphere.''
Aberdeenshire slid back into top spot with a four-wicket win at
Mannofield over Perthshire -- and that despite an unbeaten 92 from
visiting pro Lal Rajput and a superb half-century from Kash Khalil
giving them a respectable total of 207 for four.
But Sanju Mudkavi, with 61 not out, and Mike Smith, with 37, put on
the runs quickly enough to take Aberdeenshire to 211 for six.
Arbroath County are still there in second place, but they had to
settle for a 16-15 points share as Ayrshire held out at Lochlands.
Mohamed Zahid, 47 not out, George Salmond with 43, and brother John,
with 37, helped Arbroath amass 220 for seven, with Javed Ashraf taking
four wickets. But thanks to a stubborn unbeaten 78 from professional
David Harper, plus 43 from Drew Parsons, Ayrshire's chase for full
points ended with them holding out on 204 for nine.
There was a bit of a dour struggle at The Arns, where Clackmannan
County ended up with a 13-13 share of the points against Fifeshire. The
visiting side, thanks to 72 from Ashok Malhotra and 35 from Aslam Raza,
were all out for 185, Stewart Johnstone taking five wickets and Bruce
Auchinleck three.
But despite 36 from Malcolm Howell, Clackmannan could muster only 130
for five, Keith Graveling taking three of the wickets.
Bryce Robertson destroyed Stirling County at Forthill with seven
wickets for 55 as Forfarshire romped to a 134-run victory. The Stirling
side were all out for only 87 in reply to the home team's 221 for seven.
Amazingly, there were no half-centuries in that total -- Mike Cousin
unbeaten on 43, Peter Drinnen 41, and Graeme Garden 36.

PARTICK Thistle's Rod McDonald, who became an instant hit with the
Firhill fans when he signed from Walsall last season, is now
experiencing the other side of the coin and he was relentlessly
barracked as Thistle's dream of playing in the UEFA Cup came to a
grinding halt when they crashed out of the Intertoto Cup, going down 2-1
to FC Zagreb, on Saturday.
McDonald has made no secret of the fact that he is fed up in Scotland
and that he wants to return south to be with his family in Crewe, but
Thistle would want around #60,000 for his transfer, and until they get
it, the coloured striker will have to stay put and make the best of it.
As Thistle struggled throughout against the Croatians, going two goals
behind, the crowd in the new stand made McDonald their main target for
abuse, and the striker was goaded into answering back with a couple of
gestures.
Afterwards, however, the Englishman refused to criticise the
fans.''It's part and parcel of the game, and it doesn't bother me,'' he
said. ''They have a right to have a go, because they pay my wages.
''But if they want me out, then that's fine. They can have my jersey
any time, because I'm desperate to go home. I just want to be with my
family and I'd leave tomorrow if I got the chance. I just hope some
English clubs are watching the situation.''
It was a frustrating day all round for McDonald and his colleagues, as
they were well beaten by a side with lots of skill and pace.
Zagreb were also a cynical side and that led to a nasty game in which
six players were booked and others were lucky to stay on the pitch.
Said Thistle manager John Lambie: ''When people punch you and have a
kick at you from behind, it's difficult to restrain yourself. The
difference is they know how to do it and we don't. They are more fly
than we are, but thankfully we don't come up against that kind of thing
in Scotland.''
McDonald, while admitting that the Croatians were a good side, was
also critical of their conduct. ''They were a dirty side. The linesmen
saw a lot of things, kicks and stuff like that, yet they didn't do
anything about it.''
Thistle, however, were no innocents. They were drawn into a brawl and
could have had at least a couple of men sent off. And Zagreb's Rober
Regvar, who finished the match with his shirt in shreds, is convinced
full back Steve Pittman should have been one of them.
Through an interpreter, he said: ''We didn't expect Partick to be such
a physical side. The No.3 should have been sent off when he ripped my
shirt. He had already had one yellow card and that should have been
another. He became quite deranged and at the end of the match I had
nothing to say to him. But these things are normal in football, it's not
ballet.''
Much of the blame should go to the weak handling of the match by
Norwegian referee Jon Skjervold and his linesmen. If they had taken
firmer action early in the game, much of the nastiness could have been
avoided. The referee did caution three players from each side, but that
was not enough on a day when tempers were so easily lost.
Thistle's only moment of consolation came six minutes from the end
when new signing Harry Curran, who joined the club only a few hours
before kick-off in a swop deal which took Roddy Grant to St Johnstone,
scored a cracking goal from just inside the penalty area. By that time,
however, Zagreb were cruising, having scored twice through Zeljko Soic
and Asmir Dzafic.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, Turner, Pittman, Watson, Welsh, McWilliams,
McDonald, Craig, Foster, Curran, Smith. Substitutes -- Gibson, Docherty,
Ayton, Kinnaird, Cairns.

* SCOTLAND narrowly missed the runners-up prize yesterday when they
were pipped by champions England in the Youth World Cup in Holland.
Skipper Dougie Lockhart struck a superb 79 as the Scots reached 191 for

of a deserved half-century.
Experience told in the end as unbeaten England passed the target in
the second-last over, with only two wickets in hand.
Scores:
Saturday. Holland 176 for nine (R Mitchinson 3-18, S Blackie 3-49);
Scotland 177 for five (D Lockhart 53, N McCallum 32, S Moffat 32).

RUGBY union has a declaration of amateurism. It says: ''The Game is an
amateur game. No-one is allowed to seek or to receive payment or other
material reward for taking part in the Game.''
I love the way Game starts with a capital G. King Canute wrote the
passage, they say. The trouble is, of course, that we all know that,
just like many of the laws of the game like handling on the ground, the
sentiment is ignored. Completely ignored. And I think that district
rugby will soon ignore it further.
The SRU are the major source from which the players earn money, but
that can't last. Which leaves us with a problem. At the moment the money
being talked about overseas is astronomical, and all of the Scottish
players will, no matter the outcome of the meeting on amateurism in
Paris on August 25, argue for more money.
For any of them who have a touch of the whore in them -- and it was
Kerry Packer, after all, who said that 'there is a little of the whore
in all of us'' -- there may well be any number of professional circuses
to join, but, hell, not many of us ever ran away from home to join a
circus, and you would have to be some banana to take the risk.
Let's talk frankly about what happens just now. Various clubs have
slush funds that keep the players and coaches happy. An international
player gets his cash, via the SRU Trust Fund, from a percentage of
sponsors' money diverted into that fund. On top of that there are
opportunities to earn, with personal appearances and the like.
The obvious first step is that the players will argue for a greater
percentage of sponsors' money.
How they do that, I rather suspect, will be to rebel. Revolting
players? I rather suspect that they will, and I also think that if they
were to do so they would gather a fair bit of public sympathy. Your
punter in the street thinks they are worth a pretty penny. I have done
nothing but meet and speak to people who were turned on to this last
World Cup because it was such a huge event.
In every other sport that has passed through this dreadful time, a
time filled with jealousy and suspicion, the players have revolted in
one way or another to get some more cash.
Then contracts will fly between both parties, and I absolutely see
that as a prerequisite for both sides. After that, players will be tied
by contract to their clubs -- a practice that doesn't go on in Scotland
yet. Then, and I think that this is the biggest untapped source so far,
contracts will be signed between players districts.
As I look out on Glasgow I see the district side, and the future of
district rugby, becoming the catalyst for change in this country. If the
World Cup taught us one thing, it is that the gulf between our club
rugby and what the players are expected to produce against the likes of
the All Blacks, both now and in the future, is wider than the Grand
Canyon. Clubs, for all that they give the SRU a hard time over district
rugby, will never give us a base from which to win internationals.
Any sensible Scottish district will approach businesses in its area
and start to sell like crazy to attract money to bring in glamour games,
and travel abroad. To win, it will have to turn itself into a Scottish
version of a Western Province and pay its players at least part of a
living wage to prepare properly and promote rugby in the area.
I do think that's the way ahead. It means more contracts. It means
more money for the players. It means more money for lawyers. I think
I'll go shoot myself.

TOMMY McLean, sacked as manager of Hearts on Friday, will not be
turning his back on football and, when the dust settles, the man who
steered Motherwell to a Scottish Cup triumph four years ago will be
looking to be heavily involved in the sport, writes Jim Reynolds.
Having had the weekend to think things over, McLean said yesterday:
''I'll definitely be back. This hasn't soured me towards football, and I
will happily talk with any club which may be interested.
''As to what happened at Tynecastle, I don't want to say too much
about that at the moment. I have had talks with my lawyer, and we will
definitely be seeing Hearts in court. When that happens, it will make
interesting reading.''
I understand McLean may make some startling revelations, especially
concerning his early days with the club.
A contender for the Tynecastle job is David McCreery, who played for
the club in the late eighties and has had managerial experience with
Carlisle and Hartlepool.

Denmark,
RANGERS manager Walter Smith was quietly celebrating a first match
bonus at his team's Jutland hotel over the weekend.
It was not the victory over Brondby, not even the Paul Gascoigne goal,
which had pleased Smith most in the opening tour match. Instead, it was
the return to form of a remarkably fit-looking Andy Goram.
The 31-year-old keeper gave suggestions during the match that he was
back to his best and yesterday Smith pointed out: ''Andy is very
important to the team when he is playing at the peak of his form, the
way he was two years ago before his injury troubles.
''He had two outstanding saves on Friday night, which showed that his
timing has returned. He has worked hard in the pre-season training and
the match demonstrated how that has paid off for him.
''He is able to spread confidence to the men in front of him. It is
not just his own displays which count, it's the way he organises our
defence. He is very important for us. I'm sure he will get back to the
form he showed two years ago.''
Goram seems to share the confidence of his manager. After a turbulent
spell which brought a series of injuries, and then a bust-up with Smith
after which the keeper was slapped on the transfer list at one stage,
the player is now ready to take on the mantle of the country's No.1
keeper.
He says: ''I feel really good and while you can always expect to feel
the odd twinge, there is nothing which has bothered me all through
training. On Friday night, I took a knock on the shin which worried me
for a moment.
''My problems all started when Dave McPherson caught me on the shin
during a game. But there was no reaction from the knee. I felt okay. One
thing is certain, I'm not going to back off from any challenges because
of worries about being injured.
''It's when you try to pull out that you can get yourself hurt. I've
always been the kind of keeper who goes for things and that will still
be my attitude.
''Alan Hodgkinson has been working me really hard in the gym at Ibrox.
I think I probably do 10 times more in training than I'm every asked to
do in a game. But it has benefited me.
''I didn't feel too happy in the closed-door games at home, but after
the match on Friday I felt my timing was returning.
''Playing in front of a crowd and against better opposition gave me a
lift. Then, too, I did have a couple of good saves and that always helps
your confidence.
''I know I have to keep pleasing the gaffer. As long as he's happy
with me, I'll be in the team. If I don't do a job, I'll be out and there
will be another keeper in my place.''
That, though, is not in Smith's plans as Goram approaches the kind of
form which helped Rangers so much in their last tilt at the Champions'
League.
Tonight, the Scottish champions will play their second match against
Esbjerg. Richard Gough and Alan McLaren are likely to be left out.
Smith explained: ''There is nothing seriously wrong with either of
them. If these were really important matches they would probably play.
But there is no sense in taking risks at this stage.
''They will probably play in the third game and hopefully they would
then be ready for our own tournament. We want to do well in that.''
Midfielder Stuart McCall will play from the start and Paul Gascoigne
will again be given an hour or so as he continues to build towards full
match fitness.
Smith was also happy with the way Brian Laudrup seemed to pick up from
where he left off last season. The Dane was very impressive, even though
he started back training a week after the other players.
Florin Raducioiu should complete the details of his move from Espanol
to Rangers within the next few days and the fans may well see him parade
his skills alongside Paul Gascoigne's in the Ibrox tournament this
weekend.

Germany,
Kickers Emden 2 Celtic 0
CELTIC manager Tommy Burns was fiercely critical of his players last
night after they had slumped to an unexpected defeat against Kickers
Emden, a part-time amateur side from the German third division.
Indeed, the Germans would have inflicted an even greater humiliation
on the Scottish Cup-holders but missed several clear-cut chances.
There were extenuating circumstances for the poverty of the Parkhead
side's performance -- temperatures which soared into the 90s and an
ongoing ceilidh among a small section of their support which much have
been a distraction to their endeavours.
Nevertheless, Burns refused to look for excuses and was in unforgiving
mood after the 2-0 defeat.
He insisted: ''There was a carnival atmosphere, with fans singing and
dancing and eating hamburgers and fries, but we came here to do a
professional job and did not.
''Too many of my players simply went through the motions. That is
disappointing. You can forgive them not playing well at such an early
stage in the season, but you always expect and want players to work
hard.
''They let themselves down. There's no doubt about that. It is not as
if we were surprised by the quality of the Germans. We have been coming
here long enough to know that there is quality from the Bundesliga right
down through all their leagues.
''We were sluggish, perhaps because of all our hard training and our
schedule. But Kickers Emden played very well and impressed me.''
Burns must hope for a vast improvement in the two remaining games of
their tour, against Wilhemshaven and St Pauli this week.
Apart from two attempts by winger Brian McLaughlin and a 25-yard drive
from midfielder John Collins which severely tested the Emden keeper in
the early stages, there was little to enthuse over Celtic's performance.
Emden dictated throughout and belied their lowly status with a brand
of football which suggested they can rise to higher levels.
Several of their players are currently the focus of attention from
Bundesliga clubs, particularly left-winger Alex Ulkov. His pace and
willingness to take men on caused problems which Celtic never seemed
likely to solve.
But for veteran Irish keeper Pat Bonner's first-half display, the
Germans would undoubtedly have forged into a significant lead, but they
were also betrayed by the inaccuracy of their forwards.
Celtic looked vulnerable in defence, uninspired in midfield, and
incapable of posing any consistent threat in attack.
After that bleak first-half showing, Burns made four changes, with
Gordon Marshall replacing Bonner in goal and Mark McNally, Stuart Gray,
and Willie Falconer taking over from Malky Mackay, Pierre Van Hooydonk,
and McLaughlin.
Still, there was no improvement to Celtic's laboured play and it was
Emden who again exerted their authority. They missed two chances before
taking the lead in 52 minutes when midfielder Andre Schneider exposed
slack marking in the Celtic defence by releasing Kai Paukow on the
right, and the substitute advanced before lobbing Marshall from 16
yards.
Celtic had a penalty appeal dismissed when Andy Walker was brought
down and then Rudi Vata missed a chance, created by Collins, to equalise
and haul his side back into the match.
The introduction of Simon Donnelly for Walker proved just as
ineffective as the earlier changes. Sensing a rare victory over a club
which still commands a large following in Germany -- around 400 Celtic
fans were present last night -- Emden stepped up their efforts in the
closing stages and Paukow missed an open goal.
It was inevitable that as the Scots wilted in the humid conditions,
their rivals would take advantage, and they did.
In 78 minutes, Zimbabwean internationalist Gilbert cut in from the
left and swept past Lee Martin and then McNally before beating Marshall
from a tight angle.
The outcome was in stark contrast to Celtic's opening victory against
VFB Lubeck, and Burns must hope his players will regain their sharpness
after his stinging verbal attack. Nevertheless, the defeat certainly
underlines why he has been scouring the transfer markets of the world to
strengthen his side for the forthcoming campaign.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Martin, McKinlay, Mackay, Mowbray, Grant,
McLaughlin, Vata, van Hooydonk, Walker, Collins. Substitutes --
Falconer, Marshall, Donnelly, McNally, Gray.

DAVID Parker, the recently crowned champion amateur rider, has turned
professional. In a bold career move, the talented 23-year-old will join
his Kettleholm-based father, Colin, as stable conditional jockey,
claiming a 3lb allowance.
Parker Jr will be following in the footsteps of some famous racing
names such as Peter Scudamore, Richard Dunwoody, and Adrian Maguire, who
both made the same transition from the unpaid ranks.
But, for the moment at least, he is not setting his sights too high
and will be content in his first professional campaign to equal the 16
winners that brought him the 1994-95 title.
''I just felt that the time was right to make the change,'' said
Parker, who combined his relentless pursuit of the amateur crown by
doubling up as assistant to Thirsk trainer Sue Bramall.
''My ambition last season was to be champion amateur, which I managed
to achieve after finishing runner-up the year before.
''Now, turning professional is another challenge for me.
''I know it's a big step. You tend to be shielded when you are an
amateur, but I've always been competitive and intend to give it my best
shot.''
Parker, who will share the rides with another former amateur, Brian
Storey, signed off in the unpaid ranks at Wolverhampton last month when
he had to settle for third place on Moneghetti in an amateur riders'
Flat race.
He failed to score on the level as an amateur -- one of the few
objectives to have eluded the determined Dumfriesshire lad, who did not
start riding seriously until he was 16.
Now, fresh from a well-earned break, he currently has a total of 33
winners under his belt and plans to throw himself into the summer jumps
campaign at the earliest opportunity.
* VINDALOO equalled the twentieth-century record for handicap wins in
a season when he gained his third victory in four days at Lingfield on
Saturday.
The three-year-old comfortably justified 10-11 favouritism by three
lengths from Rocky Forum in the four-runner Edmundson Electrical
Handicap, leading around a furlong from home and running on strongly.
Winning jockey Jason Weaver told trainer Jimmy Harris on dismounting:
''This horse is a diamond.''
It was Vindaloo's ninth handicap win this term, equalling the total
set by Star Rage last year, Chaplin's Club, in 1985 and 1988, and
Glencroft in 1988.
He had moved to within one of the record when winning at Wolverhampton
on Friday afternoon, less than 48 hours after he had been awarded a race
at Leicester on Wednesday evening.
Nor is he likely to be slow in bidding to take the record outright.
Trainer Jimmy Harris had entered Vindaloo -- who has already run 20
times this season -- in races at Brighton and Newcastle today and
Beverley tomorrow.
But owner David Abell, who also owns Star Rage, nominated the end of
the week for the gelding's likely next outing.
''He will be entered in six or seven races next week but he won't be
seen out at the start of the week, having had three races in four
days,'' he said.

A TRY by controversial South African hooker James Dalton in the last
minute gave his province, Transvaal, a crucial 22-19 away victory over
Northern Transvaal in Pretoria on Saturday.
Dalton, banned from the game for 30 days for his part in fighting
among players in the South Africa-Canada World Cup match, took a quick
tap penalty and was driven over the line for the match-winning try,
converted by fly-half Jannie de Beer.
De Beer was also successful with five penalties in a kicking duel with
Northern Transvaal's former Springbok fly-half Lance Sherrell, who had
three penalties, a conversion, and a drop goal.
Transvaal joined Western Province and Natal, who both won their
matches on Saturday, at the top of the Currie Cup table with two wins
from three games.
Western Province outclassed a disappointing Eastern Province 32-6 in
Cape Town, with charismatic South African wing Chester Williams scoring
twice in front of his home crowd.
Canadian centre Christian Stewart capped a brilliant all-round match
for Western Province with a try.
At Bloemfontein's new Free State stadium, the home side lost a
nail-biting encounter 36-34 to Natal after Springbok wing James Small,
playing at full back, scored in the dying moments.
Fly-half Luke Smith converted to give him 21 points in the match.
Smith was watched by newly-arrived French goal-kicking ace Thierry
Lacroix, who was on the Natal bench and came on for a couple of minutes
as a temporary replacement.

RUGBY
AUSTRALIAN prop Dan Crowley was yesterday banned from rugby for three
weeks for kicking an opponent on the face.
Television cameras had captured Crowley booting All Black flanker Josh
Kronfeld as the New Zealander lay pinned in a ruck during Saturday's
first Bledisloe Cup match at Eden Park, Auckland.
Scottish referee Ray Megson, criticised afterwards by Australian coach
Bob Dwyer for ''some strange decisions,'' had missed the incident.
Crowley was cited for foul and dangerous play by New Zealand Rugby
Football Union judiciary commissioner Dave Howman. After a five-hour
hearing, the panel decided the act was not intentional but still merited
suspension.
The suspension rules Crowley out of the return encounter in Sydney
next weekend. Neither Crowley nor Australian officals would comment.
A late try by giant winger Jonah Lomu clinched World Cup finalists New
Zealand's 28-16 victory.
A new-look Wallaby side, playing without former captain Michael Lynagh
and world record try-scorer David Campese, appeared to have the game in
hand when they led 16-15 with 10 minutes to go.
But some unwise options allowed All Black hero Andrew Mehrtens to boot
New Zealand to a 21-16 lead before a fine try Lomu sealed it.
''I think it was a lot closer game than the score indicated,'' said
disappointed new Wallaby captain Phil Kearns.
Mehrtens finished the match with five penalties, two drop goals --
both from over 40 metres out -- and one conversion.
The two sides battled dreadful conditions, with storms frequently
sweeping the ground, to give the crowd a game of high quality.
Australia, playing with the wind in the first half, led 10-9 at
half-time thanks to a try by Willie Ofahengaue just before the break.
They had taken a deserved early lead with a Matthew Burke penalty, but
New Zealand quickly responded with Mehrtens' first dropped goal followed
by two penalties.
But then came Ofahenhaue's try, scored when the big flanker barged
over after a series of drives by the pack.
The Wallabies lifted their game playing into the wind. However, it was
New Zealand who scored first after the interval to restore their lead
with another Mehrtens penalty.
Australia immediately replied through 19-year-old Joe Roff, who took
over the goal-kicking duties when Burke left the field with a hamstring
injury.
When Frank Bunce was penalised for obstruction, Roff put his second
penalty over off the crossbar from 48 yards and a confident Australia
looked the likely winners.
Mehrtens then narrowed the gap to a single point with another penalty
and followed that with the easiest of three points in front of the
posts.
He gave the All Blacks a five-point margin when he potted a second
drop goal, and then came Lomu's clincher.

HOCKEY
THE countdown has begun to the finals of the Nissan European Nations
Men's Hockey Cup, which start in Dublin on August 16. Whether or not
Scotland will be in a state of readiness by then is open to speculation.
They were beaten in all three matches in the Four Nations' tournament
at Bisham Abbey over the weekend, but having conceded 10 goals in the
series against England, Canada, the tournament winners, and Spain
without registering one of their own, emphasises the amount of work
still to be done.
Time is certainly not an ally but a repeat of their display against
England on Friday, despite a 3-0 defeat, would certainly bring its
rewards. The performances in the other contests, against Canada (0-4)
and Spain (0-3) yesterday, would unquestionably bring about serious
problems.
In the confrontation with the Canadians, goalkeeper Paul Mellor was
certainly not at his best and must take a large share of the blame for
the goals. The attack was, however, totally lacking in penetration in
that confrontation and also in the tussle with Spain.
Coach Billy McPherson certainly finds himself in a corner from which
there is hardly an escape route available to him, for he has already
declared his squad for Dublin. Results:
Saturday -- Scotland 0, Canada 4; Spain 2, England 2. Yesterday --
Scotland 0, Spain 3; Canada 2, England 2.

WALTER Swinburn earned a vote of confidence while he watched Frankie
Dettori take the glory on his Derby winner, Lammtarra, in the King
George VI And Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot on Saturday.
He was promised the mount on Halling at York next month as Godolphin
supremo Sheikh Mohammed admitted: ''I still believe in Walter.''
Swinburn, surprisingly ''jocked off'' the Epsom winner during the
week, watched the big race from Newmarket while replacement Dettori
repaid the compliment with a copybook display.
The Italian delivered Lammtarra to challenge nearly two furlongs out
and saw his persistence rewarded when the colt wore down Pentire to
clinch the #220,000 first prize by a neck.
A length-and-a-half back in third was the game Strategic Choice, with
Irish Derby winner Winged Love a head adrift in fourth, and Broadway
Flyer, Carnegie, and Environment Friend, fifth, sixth, and last.
Minor injury had ruled Lammtarra out of the Irish Derby but the
all-conquering Godolphin team worked their magic again to extend the
colt's unbeaten record to three.
The big-race preparations had been overshadowed by the decision to axe
Swinburn in favour of retained Godolphin rider Dettori.
But Sheikh Mohammed countered: ''I'm sorry for that but if somebody
wants a change, it's not a big deal. I still believe in Walter Swinburn
and I hope he will ride Halling at York.
''I don't want to fish in shallow waters, I want to go deeper. You
don't talk politics in sport.''
Dettori thanked Swinburn. ''He told me how to ride the horse. He said
be bold with him and dig deep, because he will find more. There were a
lot of doubts about Lammtarra but he showed he is a true champion.''
Lammtarra, the first runner in this year's Derby to win since the
race, will now be rested, with a crack at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
his next probable target.
His trainer, Saeed Bin Suroor, will be credited with the victory but
Sheikh Mohammed celebrated the triumph by rewarding key back-room boy
Jeremy Noseda with a 35-strong stable in France from next season.
''Jeremy has been a good team player and he has helped us win a Derby,
an Oaks, and now this race. There is room for a young man to come
through there,'' added the Sheikh.
Noseda said: ''This has come as a bit of a surprise. We've only been
talking about the idea in the last few days. I've always wanted to train
in my own name but it will be hard to pull away from Godolphin.''
Runner-up Pentire looked to have the race won two furlongs out but was
just worried out of it by the determined Lammtarra.
His trainer Geoff Wragg said: ''I thought Pentire had the race in his
pocket but the other one just battled him out of it.
''In hindsight, I suppose you could say it would have been better if
he could have been held up just a little bit longer.''
Blue Duster polished up her reputation when completing a hat trick
with an impressive performance to win the Group 3 Princess Margaret
Stakes.
She became clear favourite for the 1000 Guineas at 10-1 with William
Hill, and 12-1 with Ladbrokes and Coral, after beating Ribot's Secret by
two-and-a-half lengths.
It was a case for third time lucky for trainer David Loder, who had
saddled Mild Rebuke and Maid For Walking to fill second place in the
past two years. York's Lowther Stakes will be her next target.

BOWLS
THE Scottish women's junior international side saw their dreams of a
fourth successive win disappear at Ayr Northfield over the weekend, when
they had to settle for the runners-up spot behind England.
A 73-66 defeat by the English on Saturday afternoon proved costly for
the Scots, who earlier had crushed Ireland 115-68. They finished their
programme yesterday with a convincing 103-59 win over Wales, but with
England also beating Wales and Ireland, the Auld Enemy finished with an
unbeaten record.
The Scots managed just one winning rink in their match with England,
Anne Brown from nearby Crooksmoss beating Wendy James 21-11.
But, elsewhere, England were in control, Katherine Hawes beating
Sharon Burns 22-11, Amy Gowshall adding a 21-16 win over Sandra Steven,
while Lisa Francis edged out Heather Rankin 19-18.
Yesterday, Scotland raced to a 31-14 five-end lead over Wales and by
the halfway point had all but wrapped up victory, leading 51-31.
English champion Lynne Whitehead, from Norfolk, added the British
Women's Junior Singles championship to her country's dominance at
Northfield yesterday with two convincing wins.
Whitehead secured her final spot when she easily defeated Scotland's
Claire McCourtney, from Creetown, 21-7 and went on to wrap up the title
with a similarly comfortable 21-10 win over Ireland's Paula Smith.
Results:
Scotland 115, Ireland 68 (A Brown 29, E Hastings 18; S Burns 30, A
Crangle 19, S Steven 30, D McNally 15, H Rankin 26, P Smith 16).
England 90, Wales 49 (A Gowshall 29, W Price 7; W James 22, H R Jones
11; K Hawes 22, S Hawkins 17; L Francis 17, A Butten 14).
England 73, Scotland 99 (James 11, Brown 21; Francis 19, Rankin 18;
Gowshall 21, Steven 16; Hawes 22, Burns 11).
Wales 91, Ireland 65 (Jones 23, Crangle 11; Hawkins 28, Smith 15;
Price 19, McNally 19; Butten 21, Hastings 20).
Scotland 103, Wales 59 (Rankin 24, Butten 12; Steven 21, Hawkins 18;
Burns 29, Price 11; Brown 29, Jones 18).
England 96, Ireland 65 (Francis 29, Hastings 11; Gowshall 19, McNally
19; Hawes 19, Smith 21; James 29, Crangle 14).
* BRITISH Women's Junior Singles: Semi-finals -- L Whitehead (Norfolk)

SCOTLAND'S Fraser Walker brought a glint of sunshine to his otherwise
gloomy summer with victory in the 200 metres medley and a silver medal
in the 100m back-stroke at the British National Swimming Championships
in Coventry.
The 21-year-old from Dunfermline was left out of the Scottish team
which leaves tomorrow for the Canadian National Championships, starting
in Winnipeg later this week.
But he proved a point to the selectors with an impressive win in the
200m medley, the event in which he won a bronze medal in last summer's
Commonwealth Games. His time of 2min 7.08sec secured the gold by more
than a second from Cardiff's Peter McGinty.
To add to his satisfaction, Leeds' David Warren, who has replaced the
Scot in the British team for the European Championships in Vienna next
month, could finish only sixth in 2-11.65.
In the final event of the meet, Walker claimed a silver medal in the
100m back-stroke behind Barnet's Neil Willey. The winner clocked
57.20sec, with Walker finishing in 59.24 ahead of Welshman Chris Jones.
In the 200m breast-stroke, Olympic medallist Nick Gillingham returned
to win in 2-17.32 ahead of Andy Cooper from Rochdale Aquabears.
Newcastle teenager Susan Rolph proved she is on form for a possible
European medal with a hat trick of victories.
As in the 100m event, she scored an impressive win over Karen
Pickering to win the 50m free-style in 26.84. She then went on to win
the 200m medley in 2-18.62.
Sarah Hardcastle, the 1984 Olympic medallist, also continued to show
fine form, with a victory in the 400m free-style. She touched in 4-17.82
to win by more than three seconds from Katie Goddard.
Another veteran to claim a national title was York's Caroline Foot.
The 30-year-old former British internationalist finished in 1-3.38, just
holding off the challenge from Leeds' Helen Jepson and teenager Amanda
Loots.

IT LOOKS perfectly simple. A wide open fairway, not a bunker in sight.
But standing on that first tee can so often be a trial.
Maybe you have rushed on to it without a proper warm-up, maybe you
have a flashback to that horrendous last round, or even that the
competition looks stronger than usual.
Whatever, there's never any guarantee in golf that the ball's going to
go where you want it. That is its magic.
While all eyes were focused on the fortunes of the rich and famous at
St Andrews at the weekend, golfers all over the country were hacking
their way round their own courses in a bid to emulate their heroes by
driving the ball that extra 10 yards or chipping in from off the green.
Yet my trial was hard, too. A bid to silence three dyed-in-the-wool
chauvinists whose unerring belief is that women should be seen at a golf
club only to collect their men from the nineteenth stopping-off place.
First, the all-important question of stakes had to be settled. You
know you're in a hard school when there's talk of the par-3s and birdies
as well. I half expected a wager on what number would be on the ball
each of us finished with.
With that, we were off. Their drives soared away, one out of bounds on
the right, one into a bunker on the left, and the third into position A
in the middle of the fairway. Mine was some 20 yards behind.
The down-the-middle man and I both made it to the green with our
second shots, the others floundered behind us. But the middle-man had a
flaw. His putting would have tired out those nodding dogs which
motorists were so fond of for their back shelves some years ago. After
his four putts, I was one up. Early days, they said.
So it proved. By the turn we were back to all-square and their smiles
were still broad. They were even magnanimous about my golf.
But then came the par-3 twelfth. A 2 ensured I won the money and the
doubled-up cash from the previous two par-3s, and went into the lead
again. The smiles became fractionally less broad.
The beach bum must have considered emigrating at some time, because he
seemed to be digging his way to the Southern Hemisphere in every bunker.
The plain loaf, who had a slice as thick, was beginning to get
fractious as I went two up at the fifteenth. ''Come on, boys, let's stop
pussyfooting around.''
But it was all to no avail. A crucial putt at the sixteenth put paid
to their hopes. It was strangely silent during the last couple of holes.
The main change seemed to be the size of my smile and the total absence
of theirs.
I collected my winnings and they grudgingly congratulated me.
Supposing I'm destitute, I'll never spend the most precious #1 coins
I've ever earned.

SAILING
THERE was no shortage of drama to mark the start of Loch Long Week
yesterday, the annual championship regatta for the Loch Long Class, as
-- for the second successive year -- Hero, Cameron Summer's boat, was
knocked down.
After a blustery but ''sailable'' afternoon's racing, a prolonged
35-knot squall brought heavier seas down from the lower reaches of the
estuary combining to sink Hero. Her three-man crew had to be rescued by
a nearby competitor -- Sula, owned by Kevin Rickerby and Duncan Farquhar
-- and the boat was beached.
Although no major damage to boat or crew was sustained, and the boat
-- kept from sinking entirely by its inflatable buouyancy bags -- was
subsequently towed off the beach by the lifeboat after heroic action by
shoreside volunteers held the craft off the rocks, the situation
required the attention of the race committee finishing boat and
ultimately no finishing times were taken.
Half the fleet for yesterday's opening race -- The Lucknam Trophy --
decided against participating after viewing the blustery conditions. The
only unequivocal decision taken yesterday evening, with Hero back safely
on her mooring ready to race again today, was that the trophy should go
to Alan Harper in Shalom, as he was leading on both rounds.

THE Formula 3000 championship race at the Enna-Pergusa circuit in
Sicily ended badly for Allan McNish, who spun off when holding second
place. After starting from fourth place on the grid, the Scot beat off
an early challenge from Brazilian Tarso Marques before moving into
second behind the eventual winner, Ricardo Rosset.
At two-thirds distance, McNish's position appeared secure, but he
collided with Emmanuel Clerico and both drivers spun off into
retirement. ''I had six points for the taking and he ran into the back
of me and pushed me into the barrier,'' said McNish. Positions after
four of eight rounds:
1, V Sospiro (Reynard) 30pts; 2, R Rosset (Reynard) 24; 3, A McNish
(Reynard) 10; 4, M Goossens (Lola) 9; 5 (equal), K Brack (Reynard), C

SPORTSWEAR companies are increasingly sponsoring all sorts of nice
events in sport and are often very good to boys and girls in that
respect. Mind you, they are awfully good to themselves at that, for lots
of poppy is to be made out there.
But I commend the companies, too. Reebok and Puma have developed a
considerable amount of sports involvement, especially in children's
sport, and many a sporting association with their blazered, not to say
often blinkered, officials could learn much from the commitment of
leisurewear firms, for the commitment stems often from two, not
oppositional, factors.
One, the huge and wealthy corporations want to make lots of dosh and,
two, many of their employees, even in the PR field, have a keen interest
in sport, and are often drawn from sport and physical education fields.
Friday saw yet another multinational sportswear corporation pushing
yet another sport and congratulations must be given to Nike for the
grand day out at the new and recently opened Scotstoun Leisure Centre in
Glasgow.
Nike are, of course, a huge company with a great deal of sponsorship
deals but, like many other companies in their product area, they are now
busily promoting in children's sport and games. Friday, in Scotstoun,
was street hockey for under-12s.
There was a good turnout but more than that, a lot of youngsters were
actually introduced to hockey, a field and stick sport which should be
recommended because, while footy is only now beginning to realise what
children need in that game, a great many of the specialist sports have
recognised how to look after the little ones for a good few years now.
What they need is a very light touch when it comes to competitiveness,
smaller pitches, shorter periods of game play, an absence of psychotic
dads and ambitious managers, and, in the younger years, a chance for
mixed play. for, while it may well be true that the older teenagers
should be separated according to gender, it is daft and harmful,
especially to the health of girls, that mixed sport should not be
encouraged.
Street hockey had girls there playing. Every team had to have at least
one, which was just as well because the girls were better than the boys.
And don't tell me that lassies are shy and timid. One of the named
players of the tournament, Nicola Park, aged 12, from the Paisley Ice
Rink, and who won a trophy, wasn't just a star in the final: she was
also the only player of the day who got sent to the sin-bin. Nicola
refused to tell me her offence. I suspect it was being better than
anybody else on the park.
Incidentally, what is with this Paisley? The third team were the
Paisley Rockets, who beat Glasgow's Comets after a penalty shoot-out.
The runners-up in the final were Paisley Protons, who beat Paisley Atoms
after a thrilling score from another most promising player, Alan
Campbell. The Atoms go on to the British final at Battersea Park in
London.
Actually, my favourite player of the tourney was wee Jennifer Watson,
of the Protons, who came up to my waist and wielded a murderous caman,
or whatever they call it in hockey. The reason is that she seemed to sum
up what these street ventures are all about in the summer holidays. For
a start, she had never played it before.
It's been a nice summer, by and large, for the weans and a day out
like the one on Friday is good for them, their parents, and cynical
hacks like myself. And, certainly, Nike did well, with the staff clearly
enjoying themselves, too. And the venue was perfect.
Scotstoun Leisure Centre was opened only in April (by Prince Charles,
incidentally: just as well he didn't fly in), and is very impressive,
indeed. The swimming facilities are excellent and the gymnasia splendid.
(They have a programme called Funk Aerobics: took me a bit of time to
work out the real meaning here. I thought it was for cowards like me.)
But more than that. They have all-weather pitches and tennis courts with
three inside courts. You have read me, many times before, bemoaning the
lack of inside and all-weather sports arenas but there they are now.
Nike PRO Bronwen Andrews told me how surprised she was at the standard
of facilities at Scotstoun and, indeed, Glasgow. ''We've got six venues
throughout the UK, but I can't think of anywhere better than this,'' she
said and added, ''and the weather's been lovely.'' Not often you hear
that here.
But what you should hear a lot more often is how many people work hard
to have their children taking part in grand days out in sport and, I
have to say it, even if I know full well that sportswear companies
sponsor play for what will benefit them financially, they still sponsor
it, and good luck to them.
You need a last word. Wee Jennifer supplied it. I asked her how she
enjoyed herself. ''Well, I'm going to keep playing. And I'll get
better.'' I bet she will.

TO RECALL a 42-year-old into the squad, after a two-year absence,
would normally raise eyebrows. But Middlesex's veteran of 63 Tests, John
Emburey, has eased himself into the England fold for the fourth Test at
Old Trafford, which starts on Thursday, with a consistent display of
off-spin bowling this season.
For the selectors, it hasn't been easy to replace the injured quartet
of the Edgbaston debacle -- Alec Stewart, Jason Gallian, Richard
Illingworth, and Peter Martin.
In Stewart's absence, the inclusion of Jack Russell brings an obvious
solution to the wicketkeeping problem. Although Steve Rhodes would have
been in contention, having occupied that position on England's last
tour, his form since then, compared to Russell's, would have made his
recall totally unfair.
Moreover, Russell's batting has shown remarkable improvement in
championship matches, giving him an average of 45.66. He should be handy
for England in the lower-middle order.
Fast bowler Devon Malcolm still seems a little out of favour, but
while his bowling would have been suitable on Edgbaston's wicket a
fortnight ago, Old Trafford, in the selectors' minds, may not be quite
so helpful. Despite this, the question arises whether Darren Gough
should have been retained in preference to Malcolm, who has bowled
better of the two this season. While Malcolm has, until this week
claimed 40 wickets at 22.77 in domestic cricket, Gough had not reaped
half of that. His figures in the current match against Durham, however,
are more encouraging.
England have yet to solve the problem of finding a consistent opening
partner for Mike Atherton. Even when Stewart is playing, there is always
the on-going debate whether he should have the responsibility of keeping
wicket in addition to opening the innings. Both tasks required
tremendous concentration and, therefore, the necessity of employing
specialists.
The inclusion of Warwickshire's Nick Knight and the recall of
Atherton's county team-mate John Crawley, who has been overlooked since
his return from the Ashes tour to Australia, will fill the batting gaps
left by the injured Gallian and Stewart.
Knight, who had a fine England A tour last winter, has been averaging
57.70 this season. To include him in the final XI as an opening partner
for Atherton would also provide England with a useful left and
right-hand combination.
While Robin Smith and Graham Thorpe at present are automatic choices
in the middle order, Graeme Hick is again running close to the edge.
Failure at Old Trafford will see him out of the side and prove his
intense dislike and inability to handle the fast, short-pitched stuff
that the West Indians enjoy handing out.
There is the possibility of him being dropped down the order from No.3
and, therefore, less exposed to the barrage.
Crawley would fit into any batting position from one to six and
deserves his recall, with three first-class centuries this season and an
average of 64.76. His county captain, Mike Watkinson, who finds himself
in the squad on the strength of his all-round ability, is expected to
put the emphasis on bowling his off-spinners.
If he and Emburey, who has taken 42 first-class wickets this season
for Middlesex, are both in the final XI at Old Trafford, it will be as a
ploy aimed at the three West Indian dangermen. Lara, Adams, and
Arthurton are all left-handers and with the ball turning away from them,
it could provide an interesting tussle. England squad:
M Atherton, N Knight, G Hick, G Thorpe, R Smith, J Crawley, M
Watkinson, R Russell, D Gough, A Fraser, D Cork, J Emburey, C White.

IF EVER a journal is written about the black art of making
declarations, then there will be some notable contributors.
Norman Gifford could tell the tale of time he got his sums wrong, when
he declared short of the opposition's follow-on total, and was
immediately asked to bat again, while former England skipper David Gower
would reflect on the time he set the West Indies 340-odd to win at
Lord's -- and lost.
And after the weekend's DM Hall Western Union action, West of Scotland
skipper Jonny Williams may be willing to forward a chapter.
Declarations in the Union are rather rare -- almost as scarce as Peter
Campbell hundreds. But Williams had every right to feel a certain amount
of confidence when he called an early halt to West's innings at Hamilton
Crescent against Drumpellier.
After 47 overs, West's total stood on 264 -- and there were no wickets
down. All but seven of those runs had come off the bat of openers Mark
Harper and Alastair Storie, both men reaching their centuries.
Storie made 102, fifteen 4s in his ton, with Harper hitting the
boundary 19 times, as well as a couple of big 6s, in his impressive 155
not out.
With all those runs on the board, Williams elected to give his bowlers
three additional overs in which to bowl out Drumps. Unfortunately for
captain Williams, those extra overs came in handy as the Coatbridge club
made a successful chase.
Drumpellier openers Alan Henderson and Masood Aziz went for their
shots against the attacking field placings, and rattled up a rapid 80
between them. And when that partnership was broken, in came Peter
Campbell.
Not in 25 years of playing the game had Campbell ever reached the
magical three figures, but on Saturday, ''PC'' broke that duck -- and a
few hearts in the Partick area. Only Alan Stevenson provided any real
support as Campbell led the chase.
While others acknowledge a hundred with a raising of the bat or a wave
of the cap, Campbell indulged himself in some cricket square dancing,
before making his exit, giving a return catch to Colin Mair when going
for another big smack off the bowler.
Campbell was already making arrangements to have his car delivered
back to Coatbridge when Billy McPate and Drew Pryde knocked off the
winning runs, in time added on by a generous opposing captain.
So, runs galore on one side of Glasgow, but in another corner of the
city Greenock failed to trip up Clydesdale's run towards the title.
In the top-of-the-table meeting at Titwood, home captain Scott Weir
top-scored with 48 out of 199 for seven as everyone chipped in with some
runs. Replying, Greenock were always behind the rate, and when Richie
Henderson worked his way through their middle order, a draw was always
on the cards.
Keith Sheridan took seven for 61 and his tally to 41 for the season
when Poloc got the better of the draw against Uddingston, while
Kelburne's new pro, Saba Karim, hit a debut ton in the drawn match at
Ayr, the Indian stroking seven 4s and four 6s in undefeated 107.
Meanwhile, half-tons from Iain and Stuart Kennedy, and six for 37 from
Kiwi Mike Pawson, guaranteed Ferguslie maximum points against
Kilmarnock.

WORLD motorcycling champion Michael Doohan finally buried his
Donington Park bogy yesterday to secure his sixth race victory of the
season in the British Grand Prix.
It was the Australian's first success at the Leicestershire circuit
and it tightens his grip on the world crown he won for the first time
last year. ''It was a great victory -- it is not my favourite track, but
today I like it,'' said Doohan.
He made a slow start to the 30-lap, 75-mile race -- despite starting
from pole position for the eighth time this season -- but came through
to take a comfortable victory ahead of his title rival, fellow
Australian Darryl Beattie.
1 Spain's Alex Criville took third place for the Repsol Honda team
after a frantic battle with Brazilian Alex Barros, whose race ended as
his bike ran out of fuel on the last lap.
In the first race of the day, defending champion Max Biaggi
strengthened his grip on the 250cc series with a convincing victory.

NIGEL Benn has set his sights on a world-championship showdown with
IBF kingpin Roy Jones following his simple victory over Italian Vincenzo
Nardiello at the London Arena.
An unusually modest Benn rates himself second to the American, despite
eight successful defences of his WBC super-middleweight crown. This is
the man he respects, the man he has to beat to prove he is the best.
There was no bravado talk from Benn after he punched his way past the
eccentricities of slipping and sliding Nardiello with an eighth-round
victory. Just his dream of meeting Jones.
The American is widely regarded as the world's leading pound-for-pound
exponent, but the power politics of the American pay-per-view networks
could keep them apart.
Benn is tied up with the Showtime channel via his connection with Don
King, while Jones fights for the rival Home Box Office.
The WBC champion, however, will leave any financial and political
scrapping to the promoters and TV moguls.
''Jones is the one man who wants to fight me,'' said Benn following
his first victory since the Gerald McClellan tragedy five months ago.
''I really admire Roy,'' said Benn. ''I put him in the same league as
Sugar Ray Leonard. He is the only one who picked me to beat McClellan. I
haven't got a bad word to say about Jones.
''He's a hell of a guy, and a hell of a fighter. I'd just like to see
if he is that good. I know he couldn't hit me as hard as Gerald
McClellan did. If I got battered like that again, I'd want to get out.
Either man could have died. One man nearly did.''
He waved away suggestions of a third meeting with arch-rival Chris
Eubank. But if a Jones showdown fails to materialise, that could still
prove a very lucrative career show-stopper, provided Eubank wins back
his WBO title from Steve Collins in September.
Benn will make his ninth defence on the Oliver McCall-Frank Bruno
Wembley Stadium promotion on September 2. But it seems unlikely to be
against South Africa's leading contender, Sugar Boy Malinga, who failed
to impress in his eighth-round victory over Leicester's Trevor Ambrose
on the London Arena undercard.
''It was very easy beating Nardiello,'' said 31-year-old Benn, ''very
boring. The easiest day I've had. After 40-odd fights I'm entitled to
one bad night. I need someone really to hurt me.''
Benn was kept unaware of another big-fight injury scare less than
half-and-hour before his bout with Nardiello.
WBA cruiserweight champion Orlin Norris was counted out as he lost his
title to Phildelphia's Nate Miller -- and then given oxygen and
stretchered to hospital in Whitechapel, where McClellan underwent his
life-saving operation in February.
Norris was detained overnight, but released yesterday.

ARNIE said farewell, Big Jack bade us au revoir, but Wee Gary ain't
for quitting yet.
It has been an Open so full of nostalgia that the new generation have
been swept aside as they played with their fancy new equipment, their
feather-light shafts and their aero-dymamic golf balls. Never mind the
winner, this has been an old-timers' Open.
Gary Player managed even to lay out his plans for the next five years,
which includes playing every year in the Open and perhaps even finishing
off his career back at St Andrews in the year 2000. He will be 64 going
on 45 by then.
The man is infuriatingly well, looks it, and will no doubt continue
with that manic dedication to practice and fitness that have taken him
through 39 consecutive Opens.
Nicklaus, on the other hand, will almost certainly not be back next
year and has ended his commitment to regular participation in the
championship.
He shot a remarkable 71 in the teeth of the wind yesterday, but has
decided to call it a day as far as playing every year is concerned.
''I have played in every Open since 1962, every US PGA since the same
year, every US Masters since 1959, and every US Open since 1957,'' he
said.
Maybe he is entitled to a rest, but he has every intention of playing
in 2000 at St Andrews. ''It will be more of an Arnold Palmer kind of
ceremonial than golf.''
He reflected a little on a long association with the biggest major of
them all. ''I have had wonderful times here and this last day at St
Andrews has been very special to me. The highlight of my Open career was
the reception I got here in 1978 coming up the eighteenth. I will never
forget that.''
He cited 1970 as another golden memory. ''I was signing my card when I
saw Doug Sanders miss that putt on the last green. It gave me a new
'life' and my first win at St Andrews.''
There was another Scottish memory to recall, the victory at Muirfield
in 1966 when ''everybody said Nicklaus had no chance.''
Jack and Gary harmonised in their fear that new technology will render
today's courses obsolete, but Player added: ''The Man Upstairs always
sends down a breeze at the links courses to change things around.''
Player, who became the oldest man to play all four days at the Open,
has made up his mind to end his Open career here in 2000. ''It is
possible it will be my last tournament ever.''
The little South African, winner of three Opens as well as three US
Masters, two US PGAs, and a US Open, spent some time in the press tent
(''You don't expect to get asked in here at nearly 60'') and ranged in
topics from Nelson Mandela (''Undoubtedly the finest leader in the
world'') to Tiger Woods, which is maybe not such a long distance.
At any rate, he believes that Woods, the black, amateur champion of
America, could be the next great player on the world scene.
''When I saw Arnold Palmer first time, I said he would be a star; when
I saw Jack Nicklaus, I said he would be a superstar; the first time I
played with Els, I said he would be big; and I am telling you the this
lad Woods can become a star.''
He did not compare the new with the old but did offer this view of
Nicklaus. ''He did not hit the ball as well as Hogan or Snead, but he
had a supreme mind.''
He will be at Royal Portrush for the Seniors Open this week, along
with Palmer, when the crowds will turn out to be reminded a little of
the way it used to be.
All of these magnificent golfers contributed to what has been one of
the finest of Open championships, for play, for the emergence of new
talent, and for the reminder that there is no sporting event staged in
Scotland that can match its world-wide appeal.
In the galleries, Americans mingles with Japanese, French with
Australian, Zimbabwean with Welsh. Scots cheer the loudest, naturally,
but for foreign as well as home hopes.
They were all close to tears when Arnie stood on the Swilcan Bridge,
doffed his cap, and said cheerio. That might be the abiding memory of St
Andrews, 1995, but the consistent defiance of all the odds by our own
young giant, Gordon Sherry, will vie with it for many people.
Greg Norman's description of Sherry as ''the breath of fresh air the
game needs'' was simply spot-on. The contrast of young and old was never
better illustrated.
Since the great stars have begun to wane, the old ball game has become
a touch repetitious, although always fascinating. When a 21-year-old
breezes to the front of the stage, all innocence and wide-eyed
self-belief, the older folk, including pros who have maybe become
enveloped in their own quest for success, are reminded of how much fun
hitting this wee, white ball can be.
The last words should be about Nicklaus, however. The greatest player
the world has ever seen has been a huge attraction in every major
championship here and America for the past three decades. As you ponder
on how young Sherry or Coltart or Woods will do in the years to come,
recall the master's record.
Nicklaus has won 97 tournaments around the world, has been second 58
times, and third on 36 occasions. He was the top money-winner in the
States eight times, has won more majors than any man alive or dead (26),
and was chosen as player of the century in 1988.
Top that, young men.

URUGUAY kept their nerve in a penalty shoot-out to defeat World Cup
holders Brazil and lift the Copa America in Montevideo yesterday.
The Uruguayans won a record-equalling fourteenth South American title
by winning on penalties 5-3, after the teams finished the 90 minutes
level at 1-1.
The title is Uruguay's first since 1987 and matches the total won by
Argentina. Uruguay have hosted the Copa America seven times and won on
each occasion.
Uruguayan keeper Fernando Alvez dived to his right to save Brazil's
third penalty from striker Tulio to clinch the victory and ease some of
the pain for missing last year's World Cup finals.
Brazilian keeper Claudio Taffarel was unable to repeat the heroics
which helped Brazil to win on penalties in their quarter-final against
Argentina, just as they did also against Italy in last year's World Cup
final.
Brazil had opened the scoring in 30 minute swhen Edmundo clipped the
ball over the Uruguayan defence and Tulio chested it into the net from
close range.
Uruguay equalised in 49 minutes with a spectacular goal from
substitute Pablo Bengoechea, who curled a free kick into the top
left-hand corner after having been on the pitch for just four minutes.
The rest of the game was even, Edmundo having a goal disallowed for
offside and Francescoli seeing another free kick saved by Taffarel.

CHRIS Wilkinson edged closer to a top-100 world ranking with a 6-4,
6-4 victory over Christian Saceanu in yesterday's Manchester Challenger
final.
The 25-year-old former Davis Cup player needed only an hour to
overcome his German opponent, conqueror of Jeremy Bates in the last 16.
Apart from the #4615 first prize, Wilkinson gained 60 computer points
to move up from No.134 in the rankings to a best-ever 114.
Wilkinson began as slight favourite against the 6ft 4in Saceanu, who
has fallen from a career-high world No.60 to 316. And he justified that
by breaking the German in the fifth game and then holding serve for the
rest of the first set.
Wilkinson broke again at the start of the second and then once more to
lead 4-1. He squandered a point for 5-1, was eventually broken, and,
when Saceanu held his own service, the deficit was just one game.
Crucially, Wilkinson moved 5-3 ahead and, after Saceanu had cut the
arrears to 5-4, the grateful Briton served out the match.
There was more British success in the men's doubles final, where Tim
Henman partnered Mark Petchey to a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Italians
Massimo Bertolini and Diego Nargiso.
* THOMAS Muster swept aside Jan Apell to win the #690,000 Mercedes Cup
in Stuttgart -- but only after an amazing comeback in a rain-delayed
semi-final against great rival Sergi Bruguera.
French Open champion Muster needed just 53 minutes to beat unseeded
Apell 6-2, 6-2 and clinch his eighth tournament win of the year on clay,
and his twenty-second straight final victory.
But that would have seemed wishful thinking just 25 hours earlier in
the semi-final against Bruguera when, despite having saved four match
points, the Austrian was still struggling to hold his service at 3-5 in
the second set.
Then the rain intervened, and when play resumed yesterday it was a
different story. Muster immediately broke back, and then exchanged
breaks of serve with the Spaniard before winning the tie-break 7-5 to
square the match. Muster then dominated the third set to claim his place
in the final.
Despite having only two hours' rest, Muster showed no signs of fatigue
as he effortlessly overcame surprise finalist Apell to claim the
#104,000 first prize and an #86,000 sports car.

JOHN Daly yesterday won the Open. The wild thing made my heart sing.
It remains to be seen whether the elite members of the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club believe that everything is groovy.
When they dealt out the card of human foibles, the man was not just
given a full house, rather four aces. He manages to play good golf in
spite of his lifestyle, rather like the rest of us in a much more modest
fashion. Only far, far, better.
In his time, the champion has trashed his house in a drunken frenzy,
given up the bevvy, been married three times, scuffled in a car park,
been thrown off aeroplanes, and now finds solace in his local casino,
where, it is reputed, he can spend $100,000 in a 24-hour stint at the
puggie. He can join our club any time.
It is, unfortunately, Daly's fate that he will now become to golf what
John McEnroe was to tennis and Alex Higgins to snooker. He will become
the man that the ''boring old farts'' wish did not exist.
He will suffer the curse of the tabloids until he falls off life's
mortal coil. No imagined slight from a taxi driver, no innocent kiss
from a fan, will go unreported. He may have won the Open but there is a
terrible price to be paid for such temerity -- a lifetime spent
absolutely up front.
Costantino Rocca may have been luckier with his 15 minutes of fame --
and the most outrageous putt in history -- than the winner.
Daly, of course, knew he was the champion as soon as he had put his
ball on the seventeenth green, while the Italian was scuffling about in
that bunker. There was a genuine friendliness between the two men which
other sports can only envy and which none of them will be able to repeat
as we go into another winter of discontent, disillusion, and downright
cynicism.
But how does golf -- and its ruling body -- come to terms with a man
who has set his very heart against the very essence of a game which
drools on conformity, even down to the correct length of hose when the
gentlemen take to wearing shorts in the occasional heat of a high
Scottish summer?
Daly won for the thousands of punters who watched the Open unable to
avoid the stench of hamburger stalls and been given, for their money, a
view roughly equivalent to watching the Clyde regatta from a seat on top
of Ben Lomond.
The most exciting secret agenda at St Andrews was watching Royal and
Ancient members having lunch in their tent. They do not talk, rather
they bark at each other in the uncertain accents of Glenalmond, Loretto,
and other obscure, minor public schools in Scotland.
They eat bangers and mash under canvas and their florid faces suggest
that shares in Gordon's gin are still better value than those in the
greediest privatised utility. They probably have Cash's name tabs on
their underwear and yearn for the day they wept into matron's ample
bosom after being pestered by the older boys.
Daly, in contrast, is reputed to consume 16 diet cokes, 5 packs of
Malboros, several bags of M&amp;M, and a pint of chocolate yoghurt every
day. This is a culture shock of the worst order.
Unfortunately, this all had to be watched on BBC TV, whose uneven
coverage of the event left much to be desired. They seemed to take the
view that they are not so much a public broadcaster spending our money,
rather ex-officio members of the club guaranteeing that the event is
covered with total deference, bordering on the downright pompous.
They are competent, but only just. Mr Peter Alliss is trying, not
altogether successfully, to impersonate Henry Longhurst, who in turn,
always tried to do a parody of PG Wodehouse. Mr Alex Hay is trying, and
failing, to prove that even after a lifetime in golf, he has the
faintest clue about the game. They almost missed Daly's crucial shot to
the seventeenth in normal time.
At least there is Peter Thomson, who won the thing five times and who
knew what's going on out there. ''He's in the beardies,'' he said
ecstatically when Faldo found sand. His best friend, the Old Course, had
just mugged a millionaire and he knew it.
That is golf's attraction. He is the only one who understands that
there may be other competitors out there, but the real confrontation is
between the player and his own inadequacies. It is Calvinism, with the
Good Book replaced by boron shafts and balata balls -- and that made
Daly a winner who had found redemption.
The former West Indies fast bowler, Colin Croft, was once asked what
would have happened if fate had decided that his grandmother was batting
for the opposition in a Port of Spain Test match.
''I would have bounced the shit out of her,'' he replied genially.
John Daly bounced shit out of the Old Course to prove that sports
pinnacles are inhabited only by the seriously hard cases. Which was what
I was saying here 20 years ago about Billy Bremner, before being so
rudely interrupted.

CARIN Hjalmarsson, bidding to make it Swedish victories in successive
weeks following Annika Sorenstam's success in the women's US Open last
week, finished joint second, four behind winner Tracy Kerdyk, in the Big
Apple Classic yesterday.
Kerdyk ignored a 59-minute rain delay late in the round and shot a
four-under-par 68. She finished at 11-under 273, equalling the lowest
winning score for the event and beating four others -- third-round
leader Hjalmarsson, Elaine Crosby, Caroline Pierce of England, and
Michelle McGann.
It was a surprising victory for the 29-year-old, whose best result was
a tie for third in Hawaii last year. This season, she has missed seven
cuts, including two of the last three events.
Hjalmarsson, her playing partner and the leader after three rounds,
shot a 72, but the second-place finish strengthened her hold in the LPGA
rookies' points race.
Scotland's Pam Wright shot 69 for 280 while compatriot Catriona
Matthew fell back with a 76 for 292.
* ED Dougherty recorded his first-ever win on the USPGA Tour in the
#466,000 Deposit Guaranty Classic at Madison, Mississippi, yesterday.
Dougherty, who has been on the tour 16 years, began the day three
strokes behind Dicky Thompson, who shot a 73 to finish four back.
Gil Morgan shot 69 for second place. Pete Jordan finished in third
spot after a 68.
The victory was worth #84,000 and a two-year exemption, which means
the 47-year-old can play on the PGA Tour until he is eligible for the
Senior PGA Tour in 1997.
* JIMMY Powell became the first player ever to win both the Super
Seniors competition and a Senior PGA Tour event when he prevailed
yesterday in the First of America Classic.
Powell, 60, of La Quinta, California, carded a five-under-par 67 to
finish 15-under at the 6864-yard Egypt Valley Country Club. He was five
ahead of Babe Hiskey. Tony Jacklin finished 14 shots behind.
The Super Seniors is a separate event within each tournament for
players 60 and over.

THE cricketing community was in shock yesterday after one of
Scotland's most respected players collapsed and died during a match.
It is believed that Ian Moffat of Edinburgh Accies suffered a brain
haemorrhage identical to the type which killed footballer Davie Cooper
earlier this year.
Moffat, 46, was batting in Saturday's East League clash against local
rivals Carlton when he collapsed. Paramedics were quickly on the scene
and tried to revive him as he lay in the middle of the pitch.
However, the father of two never regained consciousness and was
pronounced dead at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
The match was immediately abandoned as players struggled to come to
terms with what had happened.
Carlton's Scotland spinner, Jim Govan, was about to bowl the final
delivery of the innings when Moffat fell over.
He said: ''It was pretty obvious right away that he was in a bad way.
I put my fingers in his mouth to make sure he hadn't swallowed his
tongue. He was unconscious and his nose was bleeding.
''There was a doctor in the crowd and she did what she could until the
ambulance came.''
Accies skipper Geoff Mawdsley said: ''Ian has been one of the most
consistent and phlegmatic characters in the Scottish game for more than
20 years.
''We haven't had a very good season so far, but this puts our little
difficulties into perspective. Everyone involved in Scottish cricket
will divert their sympathy to his wife and young family.''
A post-mortem will be carried out, but family and friends have been
told the likely cause of death was a sub-arachnoid stroke.
The news was broken last night to Moffat's nephew, Stuart Moffat, who
is playing for Scotland in the Youth World Cup cricket tournament in
Holland.

FIFESHIRE and Arbroath County may sit at opposite ends of this year's
Caley 80/-County championship table, but come August 6, the McKane Park
side will be confident of upsetting the form book when the side's clash
in the final of the SCU Trophy at Boghall, Linlithgow.
Fifeshire were first to win through to a final place last night with a
comprehensive victory at McKane Park to Clackmannan County, their second
match against the Alloa side in as many days.
On Saturday, the two clubs slugged out a draw at The Arns, but
yesterday, Clackmannan provided no such resistance.
Opener Malcolm Howell was the only real threat to the Fifeshire
attack, hitting 32 in a first-wicket partnership with Neil Taylor which
was worth 61. The Wee County then struggled to 120 for seven, before
staging a slight recovery towards the end of the innings, making 163 all
out.
David Miller, with four for 19, and Aussie Wayne Sullivan, with three
for 26, were Fifeshire's main wicket-takers.
After the break, Sulivan and opener Aslam Raza ran riot, making 62 and
an unbeaten 76 respectively, and putting on a second-wicket stand of 110
as Fifershire made 164 for two.
Meanwhile Arbroath, who sit second top of the County table, found it
much more of a slog against bottom side Perthshire at Lochlands.
Opener Graeme Ferguson and Lal Rajput made 92 in a second-wicket
stand, but the remainder of the order could only make 13 runs as six
wickets tumbled.
David Armstrong steadied the nerves towards the end of the innings,
but George Salmond had already done the bulk of the damage with five for
33 to dismiss the visitors for 156.
Kevin Ritchie and Neil Burnett put on a second-wicket stand of 54
after the restart, but Arbroath fell away to 90 for five with Jim Muir
and Rajput very effective in attack.
George Salmond and Mohamed Zahid put on a sixth wicket stand of 63 as
Arbroath eventually reached their total for the loss of six wickets.

IAN Moffat, who collapsed and died while playing for Edinburgh
Acadamicals against Carlton in the East League on Saturday, was a club
man through and through, one of the hundreds who turn out week after
week for the hell of the game -- and the joy -- as proved by tributes
received last night.
Having played for more than 25 years for Grange, and then Edinburgh
Acads, Moffat was well-known and liked around the grounds. A medium-pace
bowler renowned for his accuracy, Moffat will be missed by team-mates
and opponents alike.
''He was a good club man,'' said team-mate Dave Loudon. ''He still had
a tremendous enthusiasm for the game even though he had been playing in
the East League for around 25 years.
''You don't play until you're 46 if you don't love the game and he
epitomised what amateur sport is all about in Scotland.
''I don't think there can be many people in the league who he has not
played against. We're all shattered by this.''
East secretary Bill Polson said: ''He was known for his accurate
bowling. but he was a good, reliable medium pace bowler. He was a club
stalwart.''
Edinburgh captain Geoff Mawdsley said: ''We're stunned by this.''

A FEW months ago, before a former soldier with links to America's
extreme right-wing armed militias was charged with detonating a bomb in
Oklahoma City, a series of neatly-typed leaflets started appearing in
prominent positions around the Stirling University campus.
The documents -- five pages in all -- carried the name of the National
Alliance, a white supremacist sect coordinated from a compound in the
backwoods of West Virginia. They called for new recruits and said the
''vast army of disaffected White Britons'' presented them with an ideal
opportunity to expound their beliefs and expand their operations.
''The task before us is immense and difficult,'' the leaflets said.
''We must always keep in mind that we are recruiting an elite, a
vanguard group that will build a professional organisation and an
uncompromising movement that one day will lead the masses of our people
out of their slavery and degradation.''
Students tore them down and took them to university officials who sent
a warning around Scotland's other universities and colleges. They
reappeared in Stirling two weeks ago.
For the university it was a worrying incident which they dealt with
swiftly and comprehensively, alerting security staff and passing a
resolution condemning the leaflets. For cult and sect watchers it was
another indication that Scotland is increasingly being seen as fresh
territory, open to exploitation and free of the many anti-cult
organisations and watchdogs which exist in the South.
The Herald has also discovered that a prominent and controversial
London-based cult is hoping to stage a major expansion in Scotland next
year. The London Church of Christ has revealed that it hopes to build on
its 15-strong ''embryo church'' in Edinburgh and set up a fully-fledged
centre in the city.
In addition, some hitherto little known organisations such as the
Gnostics, are finding a higher profile alongside the established names
which have a presence north of the Border.
''I would say in the last couple of years there's been an increase in
cult activity,'' said Mathew Bell, the Scottish spokesman for the
Reachout Trust, an interdenominational cult-watch and information
service.
0 ''I am extremely concerned at the upswing. The more groups that move
into Scotland, who are all active in recruitment, means that people are
going to be drawn into these organisations opening themselves up to the
possibility of not only spiritual deception but to mind control
techniques, broken relationships and a lot of emotional trauma.''
Like most colleges and universities across the UK, Stirling has had
occasional experience of cult recruiting drives, but officials are said
to be extremely concerned at the appearance of the National Alliance
literature.
The sect was founded in the USA by William Pierce, a 63-year-old
physicist and author of the Turner Diaries, the book about angry white
Americans rising up against the federal government, which is said to
have inspired Timothy McVeigh, the man charged with the Oklahoma
bombing.
It was reported last month that a Glasgow unit of the National
Alliance had been formed but the leafleting at Stirling University is
the first sign of any serious attempt at recruiting in Scotland.
''They appeared for the first time about two or three months ago,''
said the Rev Morgan Phillips, of the university's chaplaincy centre.
''They came out as fliers, printed material. Students brought them to us
because they were concerned, students from all across the religious
spectrum.''
A spokesman for the university said security staff and the police had
been alerted, but declined to say if they thought it was someone on or
off campus who was distributing the material.
Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, local council officials have been voicing
concern at the presence of a small group of adherents to the London
Church of Christ, known as the Edinburgh Christian Church, which have
been operating in the city for about two years.
0The cult watchdog FAIR reports that the LCoC has been banned from two
university colleges in London and Birmingham because of its adverse
infleunce on students. Allegedly it has caused rifts between families
and puts followers under great phsyical and mental strain, using guilt
and peer pressure to build a strong dependence on the group. The church
is completely separate from and has been disowned by the mainstream
Churches of Christ. It is outwardly fundamentalist, reserving salvation
for followers of its own rules, and it requires total commitment to the
group.
Edinburgh District Councillor Christine Richard, whom a church
official described as being ''very active against the church'', said
that she would be very alarmed to think it might be expanding its work
in Edinburgh.
Councillor Richard, a former Tory group leader, said the church
prevented followers from exercising their own free will. ''I think there
is enough evidence available to suggest that they do set out to take
over people body and soul, not only their spiritual life but their
physical life.''
In April last year, through Councillor Richard, Edinburgh District
Council's women's committee asked the Scottish Office to examine a video
about the church with a view to controlling its work. The Scottish
Office replied that while there could be public concern about some new
religious movements or cults, such groups had to be allowed to operate
freely, provided their actions are lawful.
The Herald understands that a recent approach was made by the church
to the district council for premises to hold meetings. It's understood
the group is holding meetings in a city centre flat at the moment.
A spokesman for the chaplaincy centre at Napier University said that
the church had been active on the campus at the start of last academic
year but had not been heard of since then.
John Partington, a spokesman for the church in London, described the
Edinburgh set-up as an ''embryo church'' and said it was hoped to expand
next year.
''If we send out a church we send out a team and support to help that
church, we send out ministers. It's hoped we can do that next year in
Edinburgh.''
Asked if a higher profile in Scotland would mean a concerted
recruiting drive, Partington said: ''If there were more officials from
the church, then there would be more people talking to more people.''
He added that the organisation considered itself a mainline church. He
said describing any orgnisation as a cult could be misleading. ''It
depends what you mean by the word 'cult'. If you look it up in the
dictionary, the Church of England and any group is a cult. It's a group
pf people with a set of religious beliefs. The word 'cult' has taken on
an emotive and sinister meaning because of things like Waco and other
very tragic incidents of fanatical people.''
He said the church had members from 70 nationalities and more than
1000 adherents in London alone, around 150 in Manchester and between 30
to 50 people in Bristol and Leeds. It appealed to people from all walks
of life, he said, and it was crazy to suggest that it used mind-bending
techniques on its followers. ''Talk to the deprogrammers to find out
what they do. They do a lot worse than we do, they sit people down for
days and they bombard them.''
The church did not seek a high profile, he said, and had not sought
publicity, much of which had not been pleasant. He said they preferred
to spread their message and recruit ''soul by soul and silently''.
''Jesus was controversial because he called people to a commitment to
follow him. You can't follow Jesus and live your own life. You have to
make a very serious commitment to the faith. Because of that we have
been criticised for our methods. Basically all we do is share our faith
and we do that fairly regularly,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Matthew Bell said he is keeping tabs on the newcomers to
Scotland and is hoping Scots will use commonsense when it comes to any
approaches by any cult, sect, or new religious movement.
''My advice is if in doubt, check it out. Look at it very closely and
thoroughly research any organisation before you end up committing your
life to it.''

with 57.90 metres and Helen Cowe (Aberdeen) threw 41.96m to win the
women's event.
* JAMIE Cuthbertson (Red Star AC) collected another Scottish record at
the European Championships for the blind at Valencia. He bettered the
1500-metre record by five seconds with his run of 4min 46.4sec in the
semi-final race to add to the 800m record earlier in the championships.

ONE of the joys of the Open is its international character, with a
Maori, an Italian, a Japanese chap, and even a Scot in contention into
the last day's play.
The Diary bumped into a chap in the Old Course Hotel, St Andrews, who
is working hard to bring another international dimension to the game of
golf.
Tami Al-Hajri, the president of the Qatar Golf Association, was at St
Andrews taking a break from an intensive training scheme at Carnoustie
for the most promising young Arab golfers.
A dozen players from Qatar and other neighbouring states are in
Scotland for an eight-week course, taking lessons from various local
professionals.
Mr Al-Hajri says that as well as ploughing oil revenue riches into
training, Qatar is also spending #30m on building a super links-style
course at Doha Golf Club.
The Mr Golf of the Gulf tells me that the great hope of Qatar to make
his mark on the European tour is a young man called Tariq Abu Mousa.
* RUPERT Murdoch's Sky Channel is one of the most powerful movers and
shakers in the world of sport. But it cut no ice with the chaps of the
R&amp;A when David Livingstone, the Sky Sports Channel's golf anchorman and
a weel-kent face in many countries, tried to gain admittance to the Old
Course.
His name wasn't on the list of accredited journos and he wasn't
getting in. Mr Livingstone had to spend one of Mr Murdoch's #20 notes to
effect entrance.
* THE above sign, spotted at Kingussie Golf Club by Morag Wilson of
Prestwick, appears to indicate that the club takes a pretty strong
disciplinary line with passing winter-sports enthusiasts.
* GORDON Peden, editor of the Partick Thistle fanzine What a
Sensation, tells me he has been checking out a special offer which
Celtic FC is making to purchasers of season tickets. Not because he is
thinking of changing allegiances but because he is a typically nosey
fanzine sort of person and presumably wants to embarrass the Parkhead
regime.
Celtic are trying to sell what they call Business Class packages at
#2500. For this money, you get four heated seats in the new North stand.
As as incentive, Celtic are offering two free flights to Paris to anyone
who buys two Business Class packages.
With memories of the Hoover free-flights fiasco fresh in his mind, Mr
Peden contacted Parkhead and asked if there were any strings attached. A
lady PR admitted that seats to Paris were limited and that the best
chance would be to go for a weekend flight. And presumably miss a chance
to follow-follow Celtic.
* STUART Barnes, the former England fly-half and now a rugby columnist
on the Daily Telegraph, has been writing to sundry Scottish clubs and
organisations in an attempt to make some cash for his employers. The
newspaper is trying to flog a framed set of caricatures of the 26
players in the England Rugby World Cup squad.
He writes: ''The true rugby success of the season must surely be the
great sporting achievements of the English Rugby World Cup squad in
South Africa -- as I'm sure anyone involved in the game would agree.''
One of the recipients of the letter, Douglas Somerville, secretary of
Scottish University Rugby, begs to disagree: ''My impression of the
English squad was that they stumbled through their pool, narrowly won
against Australia, and were thrashed by New Zealand.''
For those of you who cannot resist a bargain, the collection of
caricatures costs #24.95, but if you buy six you get a seventh free.
* I can't see it myself, but Viki Mendelssohn, writing in Scottish
Rugby magazine, says the Rugby World Cup produced a host of ''sexy new
stars.'' Among the players in her ''Fantasy Fifteen'' are:
Diego Dominquez: ''Blonde-haired Italian, I wouldn't mind sharing my
Corneto with him.''
Zinzan Brook: ''Swarthy No.8 with impeccable handling skills . . .''
Jean-Luc Sadourny: ''Typically French, always prepared to try
things.''
Graham Shiel makes the ratings with: ''A real smoothie, could be
naughty but nice.''

IN A Tour rocked by the third death in its history, Spain's Miguel
Indurain did his best to bring things back to normal with a
record-breaking fifth consecutive win in the classic yesterday.
Indurain, who had worn the yellow jersey since winning the individual
time trial on July 9, secured his historic success while finishing near
the end of the pack in the final stage on the Champs Elysees in Paris.
That was enough to maintain his lead of 4min 35sec over Alex Zuelle,
of Switzerland, who was the fifth different runner-up to join Indurain
on the Tour's final podium.
Belgian Eddy Merckx and Frenchmen Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault
also won five Tours, but Indurain is the first to do so in consecutive
years.
''To equal the record set by riders like Merckx, Hinault, and Anquetil
means a lot to me and I'm extremely happy,'' Indurain said. ''But also
it's another Tour of France, and that in itself is sufficient.
''Maybe I won't fully realise what I've done until I get home and have
time to evaluate it, just like every year.''
But Indurain's record win will be overshadowed by the death of Fabio
Casartelli, who crashed on a descent in the Pyrenees last Tuesday.
The Italian rider was buried on Thursday and in a tribute from all
riders, his Motorola team-mates were allowed to win the stage on
Wednesday.
Yesterday's 96-mile leg was a largely ceremonial ride from
Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois to Paris and it was won by Djamolidine
Abdoujaparov, of Uzbekistan.
The Uzbek, who fell spectacularly in the 1991 sprint on the
Champs-Elysees and broke his collar-bone after hitting an advertising
hoarding, won the final stage in Paris two years ago as well. It was his
eighth stage victory in all.
But it was Indurain who totally dominated the three-week race over
about 2254 miles.
The tall, elegant Banesto rider, who turned 31 during the Tour, became
the second-oldest man to win the race in the past 35 years. Dutchman
Joop Zoetemelk was 33 when he won in 1980.
His winning margin was slightly smaller than in the past two years
because Indurain came under more pressure from Zuelle's ONCE team than
in previous Tours.
But he coped with it so comfortably that it is hard to imagine who
could beat him if he returns next year to bid for a record sixth win.
However, the Spaniard, whose two time-trial victories at Seraing and
the Lac de Vassiviere took his tally to 12 stage wins in the Tour, does
not want to think of next year yet. ''I still have to finish my season
and then take a rest and then we will see about next season,'' he said.

A CATALOGUE of outstanding performances in Sheffield yesterday,
including two world records which were blown away on the wind, showed
the core of Britain's athletics team to be in excellent form on their
final domestic appearance before the World Championships open a week on
Friday in Gothenburg.
But the result which brought most joy to Scottish hearts was
transmitted from Hechtel, Belgium. After three years of injury hell, and
having been written off as finished, Liz McColgan ran her fastest-ever
5000m, in 14min 59.56sec.
In only her second track race in three years, the Hawkhill Harrier
finished third as Portugal's Fernanda Ribeiro broke the world record
with 14-36.45.
The Dundee woman, who will attempt to regain her world 10,000m crown
in Sweden, was jubilant: ''I ran my own race, mostly alone, because the
others went off so fast. I wish now I had gone with them.''
Though her European Cup 10,000m fourth place gave McColgan the
qualifying mark, it was by just seven seconds. It left many doubting
whether she could retrieve her former status.
But yesterday, after her fastest 5000m since 1987, Liz said: ''I know
people were not convinced by that cup run. But it was no reflection on
my true fitness.''
And though she failed to regain her Scottish 5000m record from Yvonne
Murray in Belgium, McColgan added: ''It proves to me that I am right
back on course.''
Motherwell's Murray withdrew from yesterday's BUPA International
suffering from a flu virus, but it should not deter her from the worlds,
where she will team up with McColgan at 10,000m.
Jon Edwards leapt from the sand pit, punching the air and bouncing
with enthusiasm. Britain's newly-crowned world record-holder knew he had
broken the 18-metres barrier, the four-minute mile of triple jumping.
Officials measured it, and the distance was confirmed at 18.08m. But
then the Devonshire parson's son hung his head in disappointment and
frustration. For the fourth time in less than a month, the wind, over
the legal limit of two metres per second, had denied him a place in
history.
Edwards, who set the official world best of 17.98m last Tuesday, now
has four efforts of 18m-plus, all wind-aided, more than any other
jumper.
Linford Christie scored another psychological blow over Donovan
Bailey, this year's world 100m No.1, when he roasted the Canadian over
150m. The clock stopped at 14.74, inside the world best, which stands to
Italy's Pietro Mennea at 14.8, but the wind was almost double the
permissible, at +3.90.
In such unfavourable conditions it was even more remarkable that Kelly
Holmes should take almost a second from Kirsty Wade's 10-year-old UK
best for 1000m. ''I was looking for the world record but it was too
strong.'' She is convinced, however, that she will not be denied in
Sweden. ''I am looking for gold in the 1500, if not the 800 as well.''
Steve Backley was back at his best, winning the javelin with 86.30m,
his foot injuries held together by pads made out of Yellow Pages and
masking tape.
Nick Buckfield nudged British pole-vaulting towards international
respectability when he broke the 14-year-old UK record with 5.70 metres.
There were only some 200 spectators left in the Don Valley arena to see
the 22-year-old Crawley vaulter improve on the 5.65m set by Keith Stock.
Curtis Robb was too good for Scotland's David Strang in the 800m.
Tired after leap-frogging Robb to the top of this year's UK rankings in
Oslo on Friday, Strang finished third in 1-48.11, but can expect to be
added to the world team today. Geoff Parsons, 2.10 in the high jump,
failed to grasp his last chance, however.
Grand-slam hurdles champion Sally Gunnell was less fortunate. She
warmed up with City of Glasgow's Mel Neef for a flat 400m which was her
final test for Sweden. But Gunnell damaged a thigh muscle and withdrew.
Afterwards she broke down in tears, and will almost certainly miss the
championships, though relay inclusion is still a possibility. Neef
clocked 51.96, losing for the first time this year, but to Sandie
Richards, the former world indoor champion.
Colin Jackson finally accepted some of the blame for the ruptured
relationship with officialdom which culminated in his world withdrawal.
''I made a mistake,'' Jackson conceded, regarding his failure to inform
either his coach or officials that he was going to race in Italy after
withdrawing, injured, from the AAA championships.
But he laid some of the blame back at the British Athletic
Federation's door, insisting they should have a better system for
dealing with the needs of full time athletes.
BAF currently seems unable to avoid controversy, and will inevitably
be embroiled in more today, when they attempt to delay the Diane Modahl
drugs appeal. Modahl has sprung new scientific evidence on them.

BRUCE MACLACHLAN in correcting one error in David Butler's account of
politics in July 1945 compounds this by inserting an error of his own
(July 13).
At the Potsdam conference just outside Berlin, involving the political
and military leadership of Britain, USA, and the Soviet Union, which
began assembling on July 15, Clem Attlee was indeed present on behalf of
the United Kingdom but not as Prime Minister.
As Dr Butler pointed out, although the General Election was held on
July 5, the result was not declared for three weeks, on July 26, in
order to account for the votes of Britain's Armed Forces.
Attlee, of course, had been a senior Minister since 1940 in the
wartime Coalition Government, serving under Churchill's premiership. But
the Coalition Government was dissolved on May 23, and Churchill led the
new caretaker Government until losing the July election.
In Potsdam Attlee represented the official Opposition, having agreed
with Churchill the conditions on which he would participate in the
delegation in an exchange of letters in mid-June.
Just as the conference began, the Americans tested the first atomic
bomb successfully at Alamogordo in the New Mexican desert. Somewhat
ironically, as a result of a secret Quebec Agreement on Anglo-American
atomic co-operation, established by Churchill and President Roosevelt in
1943, almost the last decision taken by Churchill on July 4, 1945, the
eve of the General Election, was to consent to the American atomic
bombing of Japan.
So, on American Independence Day 50 years ago, it was a British Prime
Minister who sanctioned the use of atomic weapons.

A SCOTTISH team, greatly weakened by injuries and withdrawals from the
original selection, decried its critics with a respectable performance
in their only international match of the season at Cardiff Stadium.
Scotland faced Wales, Turkey, and Northern Ireland in a two-day
contest which finished yesterday. Scotland finished third overall, their
men finishing second behind Turkey, while the host country won the
women's event, with Turkey second and Scotland third.
In the opening event Martin Bell took his second Scottish national
record inside a week, winning the 10,000 walk in 41min 13.65sec, and
Verity Snook matched his achievement with a win in the women's 5000m
walk.
Anglo-Scot Steve Whyte, from Luton, scored a double win in the shot
and hammer while Darren Ritchie confirmed the growing strength of
Scottish long-jumping to win his event into a headwind with a season's
best of 7.23m.
Track victories came in the 1500m from Clydesdale's Grant Graham, in
3-45.02, and Heriot-Watt student Barry Middleton in the 400m hurdles in
52.55.
Scottish sprinters could not continue the winning streak. Jamie
Henderson finished fourth in the 100m while Aileen McGillivray finished
third in the women's. But she later combined with Gillian Hegney, Lisa
Brown, and Natalie Hynd to win the 4 x 100m in 46.96.
Edinburgh's Ken Campbell won the 110m hurdles in 14.29. Karen Skeggs
scored Scotland's only other victory on the second day when winning the
triple jump with 12.31m.
Dawn Flockhart finished third in the 200m but showed her true form
with a splendid run in the 4 x 400m relay. Northern Ireland -- in a
national record time of 3-42.20 -- took the points, with the Scots
second in 3-44.24.
In the final event, Wales won the 4 x 400m, with Scots finishing last,
allowing the Welsh to overtake them and finish second in the match, by
just one point, behind Turkey. Winners and Scottish placings:

IN his attempt to retreat from his earlier attack upon socialism, J F
Montgomerie resorts to cynical innuendo (July 18).
Everybody who has lived in Britain for the last 200 years (including
myself) cannot possibly have avoided experiencing capital and labour. In
order to live, the vast majority are compelled to sell their labour in
the capitalist market.
I personally first experienced the nastiness of the system back in
1932 in my mother's womb, as she struggled in a cramped tenement to keep
the family on the rotten means-test money received by my unemployed
father.
In Glasgow's housing schemes, today, social workers are struggling to
retain some social dignity amid, in some cases, three generations of
unemployment.
Now, it is the economic structure of the capitalist market which
generates these conditions, and certainly not inherently greedy, selfish
human nature -- even among the capitalists. And these same structures
which depend on fierce competition also produce the crumbling social
fabric of our society, and its chaotic family relationships.
They also lead to inevitable military conflict, sometimes on a world
scale, as competing national capitals struggle for a greater share of
the limited market. And when war does break out, it's ordinary working
people who are sacrificed, in causes to further the interests of the
individual or state capitalists.
Meanwhile, because investors demand return on capital, the Third World
starves under crippling-interest loans.
If J F Montgomerie supports this rotten society, let him say so,
instead of sacastically fence-sitting and attacking socialists
determined to end its misery. The issue, as always, is socialism or
barbarism.
What John MacLean died for was this ''co-operative commonwealth'' as
he called it over 70 years ago. He also called this emancipation of the
workers their ''salvation'', and this, today, should also be the central
mission of the Christian faith. Justice and peace will never be achieved
until capitalism is first abolished.

JACK STRAW, the Labour Shadow Home Secretary, has made it very plain
that he regards sovereignty in these islands as embodied in the
Westminster Parliament and nowhere else.
He even clearly implied in a recent BBC Scotland interview that the
Scottish parliament, which the Labour Party have promised, would be a
creature of Westminster.
This is, of course, the orthodox English, but not Scottish, view. On
March 30, 1989, at the inaugural meeting of the Constitutional
Convention, most Scottish Labour members of Parliament endorsed the
Scottish view. They signed a Claim of Right for Scotland in which they
acknowledged ''the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine
the form of Government best suited to their needs''.
There is clearly a split within the Labour Party on this important
point of principle. Which are we to believe, Jack Straw or the Scottish
MPs?

An experience to liberate the mind or one which can trap converts in a
deadly spiral? In a special Herald investigation, Stewart Lamont
considers the attractions and addictions of membership while Kirsty
Scott examines the actitivities of these groups in Scotland.
THE desires for power, sex, and money are all in themselves strong
motivators in human conduct. Combine them and you have a heady cocktail
indeed. Mix in religion and you have the recipe for a drug which will
induce people to do things that common sense says are daft and decency
says are wrong.
The peddlers of such drugs are the religious cults you will read about
in this series.
Not all cults employ all three factors -- power, sex, and money. Some,
like the discredited Baghwan Rajneesh, who set up a cult city in Oregon,
employed all three. The Moonies (Unification Church) do not advocate
sexual liberty, as MP Paul Rose found out to his cost 20 years ago when
he fired a broadside against them including this allegation. Others,
such as Scientology, rely on a mixture of power and money to run their
religion. However, all cults have in common three factors: at their
centre a charismatic founding figure; this figure exerts enormous
control over his followers; there is a pay-off for the cult leaders
which can be financial, sexual, or megalomaniacal.
It was Scientology which first interested me as a cult and my study,
Religion Inc: The Church of Scientology, was published by Harrap in
1985, just before the reclusive founder L Ron Hubbard died in January
1986. Hubbard began as a sci-fi writer and then had the bright idea of
founding a religion. The one he invented blended technology,
consumerism, and reincarnation -- you paid to use a meter to rid
yourself of bad karma. He made it easy to join by providing walk-in
personality tests in high-street shops. Once hooked, the follower could
sign a billion-year contract with the Sea Org, the elite corps who wore
stylish military uniforms, a recruitment trick which had been used
before.
Despite all kinds of exposes of Hubbard's scams after his death, the
Sea Org sails on. Although I take no part in anti-cult activity it is
not without coincidence that I have had more approaches within the past
few months from parents trying to get hold of information about this
cult. Activity among the cults is mounting. Those caught up in various
cults are part of a new generation who missed the bad publicity first
time around and have fallen for the hard sell in a time of resurgence
for the cults.
My study of one cult led me to read about others. For a number of
years I received the Cult Observer, an excellent publication by the
American Family Foundation, a cult information service based in Weston,
near Boston. It bore in on me how intensely similar the tactics and
techniques of the various cults were, when stripped of their esoteric
language and pretensions. Cults are a kind of religion parasite which
increases activity in times of uncertainty and rapid social change.
Expect this to increase as we near the millennium. The symbolic appeal
of a new era dawning and an old one drawing to a close, is fertile
climate for cult growth.
'Twas ever thus. The end of the medieval world was accompanied by the
world of cults which were nominally Christian since heresy laws meant
the death penalty for followers of other religions. The Flagellants were
one such group who beat themselves with twigs to induce visions. The
unofficial communes of the Free Spirit movement were also prone to
cultic tendencies. One of the most famous cult mass suicides (prior to
Jonestown in Guyana and Koresh in Waco) was the Anabaptist ''King Jan''
and his followers at Munster in the early sixteenth century.
The key question is not whether cults can be eliminated -- they
clearly cannot without controls unacceptable in democratic societies.
Rather the question is how to differentiate between a benign or
beneficial religious group and a malign and malevolent one. Smart cynics
will not be slow to point out that Christianity can easily be presented
as a cult in its early years, with a charismatic leader whose followers
left their families and gave up all their possessions to join the
movement.
However, despite periods of excesses, the Christian Church differs
from cults in that it is basically world-affirming rather than
world-denying and is inclusive in its ultimate aim, not exclusive. More
important, it does not use any of the control mechanisms over its
followers which I would contend are the true hallmark of a cult.
''Brainwashing'' or mind control, which accounts for the hold the cult
is able to exert over converts and their personality changes, is
achieved in many ways, some shared among the cults. It is a kind of
hypnosis but not the type induced at a single session on a
hypnotherapist's couch. Many factors come together to exert pressure on
the converts until they reach a point at which they either rebel and
reject the influence, or ''snap'' and knuckle under. Far from being the
mentally weak who sign up for cults, it is often those of a lively and
questioning mind who do so.
''Love-bombing'' (as practised by the Moonies) is one of these
tactics, in which the convert is never left alone for a minute and kept
under constant emotional pressure. Sleep deprivation and poor diet are
other factors, usually achieved by a hard regime in which menial tasks
require to be performed by the convert until he or she proves him or
herself, or else achieved by long hours proselytising on the streets.
Some cults induce a quasi-hypnotic state by the constant chanting of a
mantra such as ''Hare Krishna''. Others have meditation as a central
facet of their activity and find it easy to implant the required
obedience and compliance while the convert is in an altered state of
conciousness.
A test of whether this mind control is being practised is the reaction
of the cult when the follower is put under pressure to resume normal
links with his or her family. The cult will usually act to minimise
contact with the family (most cults shift converts away to a base far
from home influence) or send a ''minder'' to sit in at all meetings with
family to alert the cult if the spell is breaking.
The practice of kidnap and enforced rescue by ''Deprogammers'' is
controversial and meets fire with fire. It is often resorted to by
desperate parents who are denied a chance to talk to their offspring
about their cult involvement. Most cultists can be deprogrammed over
time without such violent intervention, or will achieve it themselves,
but this will mean the parent letting go for a long period and waiting
for the prodigal to return home.
A few years ago ideas were floated of bringing cults under a European
directive from Brussels or else of issuing licences to new religious
movements so that they can be controlled if they misbehave. The cure in
this case is surely more dangerous than the disease. It shows a naive
faith in the administration of law which borders on that of a cult
devotee.
In my opinion, the answer lies in educating the public through the
media and the cult-watch groups such as those mentioned below. There is
now a database on cults on the Internet. If legislation is required it
surely would be more appropriate in the area of mind control, but this
is easier said than done. More practical would be control through fiscal
oversight. One reason that California is so popular as a base for crazy
cults is that religions are tax-exempt. Making them account publicly for
their funds would perhaps help eliminate some of the shysters.
My own list of cults would include, alongside the more infamous ones,
Hare Krishna; the TM Organisation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi based in
Switzerland; as well as nineteenth-century cults such as the Jehovah's
Witnesses and the Mormons. We could argue about the relative harm which
these movements achieve but there is sufficient literature about them to
make the allegation a fair one. There can also be cults within
mainstream religions. In recent times sub groups within the Roman
Catholic Church such as Neocatechumenate, Focolare and Opus Dei have all
been accused of being cults or cultists in their operations.
It is difficult to obtain an exact definition of a cult, but where we
find people satisfying the lust of a charismatic leader for power, sex,
or money, who is exerting influence via mind control, there is a case
for calling such a religious movement a cult. If it splits families and
oppresses followers, it is a classic cult. If it sees those who are not
of its ranks as enemies, it is antisocial and dangerous. There is
unlikely to be a legal remedy for cults -- only the truth will set free
those who have imprisoned themselves in a lie.

IT is of course nonsense for Alex Salmond to argue that ''Devolution
is about as safe in Blair's grip as the health service is in Tory
hands'' (After the Tory fox . . . , July 19).
It is not the nature of the proposed Scottish parliament that is the
problem, but the West Lothian question, which has proved as baffling to
constitutional reformers as the Irish Question was to Gladstone.
Quite how the Labour Party believed that regional assemblies in
England could be equated with the democratisation of the functions of
the Scottish Office will probably remain a mystery.
There is no neat solution to the West Lothian question (other than
independence), but the British constitution isn't neat and it never has
been.
Labour has two options. It can ignore the problem, but then a
subsequent Tory Government would apply its own solution, most probably
by cutting Scottish representation, so diminishing the prospects of
another UK Labour Government.
More sensibly, Labour could combine a reduction in Scottish
representation to the UK average with the introduction of electoral
reform -- another proposal which the Labour leadership is said to be
going off.
The best argument against proportional representation is that it can
give small parties disproportionate power. But first past the post gives
wholly disproportionate power to the Tory party.
The main non-Conservative party has won usable working majorities just
three times this century, and we are now experiencing the longest period
of uninterrupted one-party rule since the introduction of the mass
franchise in 1867.
Labour needs more than one term in office to make fundamental changes
to society and the economy. It's about time it woke up to the realities.

I NEVER imagined that once again I would witness the savagery and
brutality being waged by one human being against another. To witness
men, women, and children, the old, sick, and infirm being driven from
their homes with little food, water, or shelter is unacceptable.
The time for ''jaw jaw jaw'' rather than ''war war war'', as suggested
by Churchill, has surely passed. A Dunkirk scenario of unprecedented
proportions is in the offing and unless we can stop this monster in its
tracks more and more horror stories are going to emerge daily.
We do not wish to see any of our own lads killed or injured so might
it not be wise to withdraw all UN/Nato, etc, personnel and issue an
ultimatum that unless hostilities cease immediately, Cruise missiles
will be targeted via satellite on command, weapon, and store dumps?
We have the weapons to do this, why not use them? The Western Powers
surely are not that strapped for cash; we used them in the Gulf with
effect.
Retribution would be swift, the cost of war trials eliminated, and
there would be a demonstration to the rest of the word that expansionism
will not be tolerated.

I HAVE watched with increasing frustration over the past three years
as Bosnia is savaged by the Serbs and the West's position becomes more
confusing.
I cannot answer why we refuse Bosnia the right to defend itself from
attack, by cutting off arms supplies. It troubles me as to why we appear
to sit by unmoved and indifferent to murder, rape, and pillage occurring
daily in Bosnian towns and villages.
It greatly bothers me that all the evidence of the past three years
suggests that there is an international conspiracy being effected, to
acquiesce in the destruction of this sovereign country.
Could the fact of a mainly Muslim people living in Europe have
anything to do with this scenario? Whatever their motives it seems to me
that Western leaders are intent on allowing blatant aggression to
succeed. I suspect we will pay for this perfidiousness some day.

I SUPPOSE I am not alone in deriving both amusement and instruction
from browsing through dictionaries of quotations.
It intrigues me to see that some of our politicians have been doing
the same. They have apparently discovered Bismarck's famous observation
about the Balkans not being worth the healthy bones of a single
Pomeranian musketeer.
Some sources have it as a Prussian grenadier which, I feel has more of
a ring to it, Pomeranian musketeer merely calls to mind Cruft's and
Alexandre Dumas pere.
The instability inherent in the wreckage of the old communist
hegemony, and the ominous threat posed by a hangover too many in the
Kremlin, or perhaps a coup d'etat with Mr Zhirinovski with his finger on
the button, remind me of another of the old boy's prophetic sayings.
He considered that another war in Europe would come out of some damned
foolish thing in the Balkans.
He was right before.

THE death of the Prince Imperial in Natal on June 1, 1879, as
described in the letter by John R Stephen (July 21), was indeed a
tragedy for the Bonapartists in France and its colonies. However, the
statement that ''his naked and abused body was found later'' requires
clarification.
Zulu warriors followed the Spartan dictates laid down earlier in the
nineteenth century by their great leader Shaka. No prisoners were taken.
Even badly-wounded comrades with poor chances of survival were
immediately dispatched and after any battle all the dead were stripped
and disembowelled.
This may seem repulsive, but was normal Zulu practice for two reasons.
The first was religious or superstitious, depending on one's point of
view, the Zulus believing that the spirit had to be allowed to leave the
body.
The second was more practical, in that the procedure avoided the
dreadful swelling and stench from putrefying corpses, a horrific memory
for most survivors of major battles.
This would have been the fate after death of the Prince Imperial.
Considering some of the evidence of the atrocities recently in Bosnia,
the use of the word ''abused'' to describe these activities seems not
only harsh but a slight on a proud and downtrodden race.

A B-LISTED art deco building, which has deteriorated into one of
Glasgow's biggest eyesores, is set to be restored to its 100-watt glory.
The former Luma lamp factory in Shieldhall Road, which later became
Caravanland, has been standing empty for 13 years. However, the
Linthouse Housing Association, which bought the site last year, has
begun a #3.5m project to turn it into flats.
The building contains a huge tower, where lamps were tested, and the
hope is to turn it into ''a beacon welcoming people to Glasgow''.
Mr John McBride, the housing and development manager of the
association, said: ''As it is a listed building, we can't alter the
structure, but we see this development as more than just a conversion.
It is the type of building that could become a real landmark for
Glasgow.''
He said the plan is to light the tower from the inside and have it
floodlit from the outside. ''I think the effect will be quite
outstanding. It will be nice for people coming into the city from the
airport to see a beautiful building rather than a derelict one.''
The three-storey factory was built by the Scottish Co-op Workers
Society for the Empire Exhibition of 1938. The joint effort of the
wholesale societies of Scotland and Sweden in turn led to the formation
of the British Luma Co-operative Electric Lamp Society.
The architect was Cornelius Armour. His work was described as
''outstanding architecturally, the principal feature being a tall,
conical glass tower surmounting the south-west corner and rising to a
height of 84ft''.
A description of the factory read: ''One of the most fascinating and
essential stages of production of the lamps is the last -- the testing
of the finished product for light and life.
''Samples are conveyed to the testing tower where they are burned
under control at an excessive voltage for a considerable length of
time.''
Blackout regulations during the war prevented the tower from testing
lamps at night. At this time, it saw service with the Royal Observer
Corps when it was considered ''as a most suitable lookout post''.
In the 1970s, Luma changed hands and was used for various enterprises
before being taken over by Caravanland.
The Linthouse association plan envisages that the factory and its site
will eventually form 43 flats for sale with 12 cottage flats for rent.
The project is expected to be completed in just over a year.
The association has renovated more than 1000 tenement flats, built 37
new ones, and landscaped seven back courts since it was formed in 1975.
Mr McBride added: ''Strathclyde Regional Council has applied for
European Regional Development funding on the basis that this project is
obviously more than just a housing development.
''The Luma building is a first-rate example of 1930s art deco building
in Scotland with a distinctive tower that happens to be beside the main
arterial route into Glasgow.
''Ask anyone who travels on the M8 and they will recognise this
building. This project provides an opportunity to make the gateway to
Glasgow special.
''Many cities have landmarks that make them stand out, such as the
Statue of Liberty in New York. Although not in the same league, if
sufficiently funded, the Luma tower building could stand out like a
beacon welcoming people to Glasgow.''

BRUCE Sandison's article on Crown Estate salmon farming profits is
depressing (July 13). How can a body which depends upon salmon farming
for one-third of its income be unbiased in appraising the damage which
many people, including ourselves, believe salmon farming causes to wild
fish stocks?
As riparian owners of fishings on a West Highland salmon and sea-trout
river, we were appalled by the vacuity of the report of the West
Highland Sea Trout &amp; Salmon Group (WHST&amp;SG) purporting to address the
problem of declining West Highland salmon and sea-trout stocks.
It is beyond reasonable doubt that sea-lice infestation from the
ever-increasing number of Crown Estate licensed fish farms close to wild
salmon and sea-trout systems is a major cause of the present steep
decline in West Highland migratory fish numbers.
Can Martin Gravestock, the Crown Estate representative on the WHST&amp;SG,
disclaim Irish and Norwegian scientific data indicating that sea-lice
infestation is likely to be a major cause of such a decline?
And why is the estate apparently failing in its obligations under the
terms of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation Agreement,
to which the UK is a party, to minimise impacts from salmon aquaculture
on the wild fish stocks?
Will he explain what the estate policy is in this regard and why they
have not adopted a ''precautionary principle'' in the issue of new
fish-farm licences?
We have a duty of care for our river but it seems to us that the Crown
Estate cares for little other than its own profit. In the absence of any
evidence that the estate will address these matters, we wonder if the
Crown Estate is a suitable body to administer the granting of
salmon-farming licences.

THE Scots can blame no-one but themselves for the increasing foreign
ownership of our land as we have created a culture of political and
social passivity which is attractive to investors.
Quite simply people would not buy estates if there was any chance of
their investment being put at risk as business dislikes uncertainty and
loves stability.
We should create instability by organising civil resistance to include
land raids, housing our homeless in empty cottages, and mass fish-ins on
exclusive salmon rivers.
Let's copy the successful social ostracism campaign of Parnell in
Ireland against Captain Boycott by urging tenants not to pay rents and
for goods and services to be denied to owners and their agents.
Adoption of such tactics, together with a boycott of estate agents
handling such sales, would soon result in a decline in interest and drop
in land values as buyers invested elsewhere.
The question, of course, is whether the Scots are serious about land
reform or are merely content to let off steam in your letters pages.

IT is to be hoped that manufacturers and trade unions will support the
scheme that will give young people who are not academically minded some
experience in industry.
The value of manual work, particularly if it is supported by
day-release classes, evening classes, or Open University, cannot be
overrated.
The engineering profession has never been limited to those with
academic qualifications.
In recent months I have had the good fortune to be able to help
several young people to get jobs, but with only one exception the young
people concerned were aged 16. I would find it virtually impossible to
place a graduate without any hands-on experience, in my own industry of
shipbuilding at least, with any company I know.
Sir Graham Hills has stated that there is a growing need for
industries that are based on manufacturing skills and craftmanship to
promote and maintain such talents. Metalbashing may not find its former
place in shipbuilding but craftsmanship will still show.
I was talking recently to an engineer who worked on the Swedish
America Line's ship Kingsholm, built at John Brown's shipyard on very
traditional lines, and he said, with great feeling, ''She is a beautiful
ship''.
He then used a most unusual expression, ''a most comfortable ship, a
ship of the highest quality''.
I cannot believe that the features he was referring to were the work
of the academically gifted alone.

DUNDEE United chairman Jim McLean last night denied that Celtic were
on the point of signing Tannadice defender Gordan Petric.
McLean then hit out at the Parkhead club for leaking confidential
details of talks which took place last week over the future of the
Yugoslav, but he did confirm that Celtic's Tommy Burns had contacted
United manager Billy Kirkwood about Petric and that a fee of #1.2m had
been mentioned.
''At no time have Celtic tabled an offer for the player,'' said
McLean, ''and if they are letting it be known they are expecting to sign
people in the next 48 hours, all I can say is that Gordan Petric won't
be one of them.
''The fact is that they were told in no uncertain terms that the
figure mentioned would not be acceptable to Dundee United.''
McLean added: ''I am not angry or seething over this episode, but I am
bitterly disappointed with the way Celtic have handled things.
''Conversations like the one between Tommy Burns and Billy Kirkwood
occur all the time in football, and are on the understanding that they
remain private. Yet details of that conversation were known to a
journalist within hours and appeared in print. That leak did not come
from Tannadice.
''Celtic appear to be playing games with their fans over moves for
players and that is up to them, but it becomes our business when it
involves one of our players.
''I am concerned when this happens at a time when we are trying to
sign players rather than sell them.''
United made a public show of the fact that the former Partizan
Belgrade player is still their man by fielding him in a 3-0 win
yesterday over Finnish second-division side King's Soccer Club. The
defender played in the second half along with other United men who miss
the start of the season because of suspension.
Roy McBain opened the scoring in the first half and Andy McLaren,
voted man of the match, added a second before Robbie Winters completed
the scoring.
Kirkwood was pleased with the performances of the three players making
their debuts, Ally Maxwell, Rab Shannon, and Neil Caldwell. The manager
said: ''Overall, this was a highly encouraging performance and I'll be
happy if we show the same commitment in training as well as our other
matches.''
Former Rangers goalkeeper Maxwell was the only casualty, suffering a
slight groin strain.

BIRTHDAY celebrations, I had come to the conclusion, are for the very
young and the very old, with perhaps a few exceptional milestones along
the way, like the 21st and the 40th.
Personally, I can remember very few. But the fact that I have just had
one of the most memorable of all birthdays would suggest that the
advancing years are beginning to tell me something. Mind you, the
circumstances were rather special.
There I was, up by 6am, striding the deck of the luxury-liner Royal
Princess as she sailed up the sunrise of a glorious morning, out of the
Baltic and into the safety of St Petersburg harbour.
This city of stunning beauty, which used to be Leningrad, was
strangely deserted this Saturday morning, its long, broad avenues
opening out to spectacular squares and breathtaking buildings like the
Winter Palace, a reminder of the style in which the Czars of Russia used
to live.
In the lazy atmosphere of a week's end -- and with cruise-line
passengers spilling on to the streets of the city -- the irony of it was
that there were more Americans than Russians to be seen in the heart of
St Petersburg.
So, in temperatures reaching for the 90s, I took in the marvels of the
Winter Palace, overflowing with some of the greatest art treasures from
Rembrandt to Picasso, and eventually found my way to a birthday lunch at
the city's Moscow Hotel.
In the vast dining-room, you could have believed that they had laid on
a special event for the birthday boy. There was champagne on the table,
a full orchestra, and a floor show which featured all that balletic
beauty at which Russian dancers excel.
As I sat with a largely American clientele, I couldn't help
remembering the days of 25 years back, when I found myself visiting both
the United States and the Soviet Union -- warming to both sets of people
and wondering how they could possibly be at each other's throats in the
dark suspicion of a Cold War.
The privilege of journalism enabled me to raise such a question. But
surely, I had said, it would be different if the people themselves could
meet. Given the understandable human frailty of suspecting the unknown,
the plain fact of those days was that very few Americans had ever seen a
Russian, and vice versa; except that American life itself had been so
enriched by the immigrants from that distant land.
In one area alone, where would the great American musical have been
without men like George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, and Richard Rodgers?
But if the Soviet bloc of 25 years ago had seemed such an impenetrable
fortress of totalitarianism, the astonishing events of the 1980s would
show that the age of miracles was still with us.
Now that the frontiers are open and the Americans are flooding in,
there is willing acknowledgement that there are no horns or hidden tails
in the Russian citizenry. They are just people like themselves, in some
ways very like themselves.
So the lunchtime cabaret swirled to a climax and the Americans gave
the Russian entertainers a thunderous ovation. People from the two most
powerful nations on earth had found each other at last, warm, friendly,
appreciative.
But if the stifling nature of totalitarianism has been replaced by the
greater freedom of the market economy, there is a certain price to pay.
The waiters serving our lunch delayed the pudding and the coffee for a
purpose more pressing in their priorities. They were trying to sell us
their souvenirs!
This was capitalist opportunism run riot, rather sad in its
clumsiness. No thanks; no crystal goblets today. But, if you don't mind,
I would rather like my ice-cream.
Out from the cabaret and champagne, I sought a quieter, more private
rendezvous with one of my great heroes, Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. I
found him in a corner of the quaint little Tikhvin churchyard, where his
remains lie beneath a life-like bust of the great man.
I sat down to look at him and caught the eye of a rather melancholy,
troubled human being, as if he had just become resigned to the fate that
was in store -- the suicide which was pressed upon him in 1893 by a
so-called court-of-honour at the Conservatory when they discovered his
relationship with a male aristocrat. The poor genius was hounded to his
death at the age of 53.
With Borodin lying a few feet away and Rimsky-Korsakov just round the
corner, what a wealth of melodic splendour to thrill the ghosts of the
night. Inside the adjoining church, the choir sang softly and I could
hear again the wonder of Tchaikovsky; so much so that I went back and
sat by his grave and found it hard to pull myself away.
Back on board the Royal Princess there was dinner and more champagne,
a birthday cake and a card from the captain. We all danced the night
away till I wandered out on deck to discover that the big red sun was
still hovering on the rim of the horizon at 11.15pm.
It seemed like the glorious backcloth to a spectacular Russian ballet.
Goodnight St Petersburg. Goodbye to another year. Time now for a
swelling overture from the soul of Tchaikovsky.

BRAHMA KUMARIS: Founded in India in 1936 by Lekh Raj, a successful
businessman who handed the running of the group over to eight women.
Have had a presence in Scotland for around 17 years. Centres in Glasgow,
Aberdeen, and Edinburgh. Describe themselves as an educational
organisation and take exception to the use of the word ''cult''. Have
held peace conferences with the support of the UN and are a listed NGO
(Non-Governmental Organisation) with the UN. In Scotland, offer a range
of courses in meditation and positive thinking. Students study spiritual
knowledge and values. Full-time members practise frequent meditations
starting at 4am. There are thought to be over 370 centres worldwide.
Practise vegetarianism and celibacy.
* CENTRAL LONDON CHURCH OF CHRIST: Quite distinct from the mainstream
Churches of Christ. The LCC was established in the UK in the early
1980s. Cult watchers say it follows fundamentalist teaching, makes heavy
demands on members' money and time, and insists no other Christian
church can lead to salvation. Encouraged to marry within the church.
Strong recruiting practices with approaches on streets and campuses.
Came to Scotland just over two years ago. Small ''embryo church'' of 15
or so people in Edinburgh, but hoping to see a major expansion in
Scotland in the next year.
* THE FAMILY (Formerly Children of God): Based at Bonnington House in
Wilkieston, near Edinburgh, the Family moved into Scotland last year.
Founded by David Berg in 1968 as a spin-off of the US-based Jesus
Movement, the group has attracted much controversy. Berg's writings, Mo
Letters, described as pornographic. Early recruiting strategies, now
defunct, included ''flirty-fishing''-- using seduction to gain new
converts. Now practise ''litnessing''-- literature and witnessing.
Commune lifestyle, sharing of sexual partners. Recruiting has tailed off
since the early days of the movement and the group's efforts are now
directed towards selling literature, posters, videos and music tapes.
Singing groups, including young children, can be found fundraising on
streets. Sometimes known as the Missionaries in Scotland.
Family spokeswoman, Rachel Scott, described the ''flirty-fishing'' as
''a method to bring God's love to people, usually to lonely businessmen.
We just wanted to share God's love with them in a tangible way.'' Scott
said the recruitment process is long and includes a six-month waiting
period.
* GNOSTICS: Follow the teachings of the Mexican ''doctor'' and
researcher Samael Aum Weor, who launched the movement after studying the
Mayan culture in Mexico and supposedly discovering the ''key to
consciousness'' which runs through all the world's religions.
Headquarters near Barcelona, Spain, run by Ernesto and Chloris Baron,
and a Centre for Gnostic Studies in London. Believe in hidden knowledge
and the fourth dimension. Secretive group but there are reports that
they are operating in the Central Belt and Aberdeen. Recent meetings in
England have attracted between 500 and 600 people. Teachings are
considered controversial because it's claimed they can produce altered
states of consciousness. One of their publications, The Manual of
Practical Magic, describes how you can become a god. Literature
apparently bans ejaculation, promotes meditation.
* HARE KRISHNA (also known as Iskon -- International society for
Krishna Consciousness): Founded in 1966 by Swami Prabhupada. Bases its
teachings on the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient Hindu books of
knowledge. Adherents easily identifiable with shaven heads for men,
eastern robes, clipboards and vegetarian books. Recent ''Call out
Gouranga'' advertising campaign includes entire Edinburgh bus. Scottish
base at Lesmahagow. Monastic lifestyle, marriages arranged, and sex for
procreation only and only with approval. Heavy recruiters, can usually
find at least one ''monk'' at the top of Cockburn Street in Edinburgh.
* NATIONAL ALLIANCE: Founded by US physicist William Pierce as an
extreme right white supremacist sect. Links to the Oklahoma bombing and
America's armed militias. Virulently racist and anti-semitic, the
National Alliance is reported to have a presence, albeit small, in
Glasgow.
* OSHO (Formerly known as RAJNEESH): Founded by the Baghwan Shree
Rajneesh in 1969 in India. Advocate letting go of your mind, aggression
and sexual energy. Nicknamed the sex cult by the tabloids. Large number
of women followers. Clothing originally orange or red. The Baghwan was
often as famous for his love of expensive jewellery, Rolls Royces, and a
computer-controlled swimming-pool. He was rumoured to have died of Aids.
Controversial meditation systems and strong dependence on the guru.
Spokeswoman for the organisation in London said there were many Scottish
disciples.
* SCIENTOLOGY: Founded in the 1950s by sci-fi writer and former naval
officer Lafayette Ron Hubbard, who died in 1986. Have had an office in
Edinburgh for a number of years. Strong recruiters, offering personality
tests, then a series of courses and seminars. Thought to have several
million members worldwide with some high-profile adherents. Cult
watchers say the group exacts a heavy financial commitment on members
and there is danger of isolation and alienation from family and friends
and strong dependence on the movement.
* SUBUD: Little-known group who have had a presence in Scotland since
1958. Do not recruit; new members must request to join. Founded by the
Indonesian Mohammed Subah Wididijojo. Practice ''latihan'' which
Scottish representative called ''a pure form of worship surrendering the
desires that rampage through all pople and submitting to the will of
God''. Prefer to be described as a religious brotherhood. Scottsh bases
in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Around 100 members in Scotland.
* UNIFICATION CHURCH (the Moonies): Founded in 1954 by the Rev Sun
Myung Moon. Teachings based on the Bible, eastern concepts and
numerology. Full membership demands total commitment, total obedience to
Moon and in many cases a break with the past, families, and careers.
Associated membership is less demanding. Politically right-wing and
anti-communist. Recruiting largely at grassroots level through MFTs,
mobile fundraising teams who sell plants and trinkets to the general
public. Groups in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee. Spokesman said they
believed in God as the parent and that we as children had responsibility
for our actions and the mess we are making of the world.
* WAY INTERNATIONAL: Founded by Paul Wierville from Knoxville, Ohio,
in the 1950s. Teachings based on Wierville's interpretation of the
Bible. Newcomers join a course called ''power for abundant living'' with
the eventual goal of becoming Word over the World Ambassadors who spend
eight hours a day witnessing and setting up new fellowships. Recommended
reading for a 1980 conference in Manchester included books suggesting
the Holocaust never took place. British headquarters at Gartmore House
in Aberfoyle.

<HEADLINE>Tour operator hits out as two die and two Scots are hurt on route from Turkish airport. Second bus crash on 'death road'</HEADLINE>

A TOUR operator involved in two fatal bus crashes in Turkey over
recent weeks has warned that further accidents might happen unless the
Turkish authorities improve safety on a notorious stretch of road.
The Turkish drivers of a lorry and a bus carrying 14 British
holidaymakers were killed when their vehicles collided head-on. The bus
was travelling from Dalaman airport to Olu Deniz, near Fethiye on the
Aegean Sea coast, early on Saturday. Two bus passengers, both Scots,
were injured but not seriously.
The passengers had flown to Turkey from Newcastle on Friday night and
were booked with Inspirations Holidays of Horley, near Gatwick -- the
same company involved in a similar accident last month when a bus
carrying Scottish holidaymakers and a lorry collided on the same road,
killing three tourists and a Turkish lorry driver.
The Foreign Office in London yesterday confirmed that one of the
injured Scots in the latest accident was Mrs Linda Johnston of
Galashiels, who suffered a broken arm. It was unable to name the other,
a man who apparently broke a leg.
The Foreign Office spokesman said: ''An honorary consul, who has been
at the scene of the accident, has been assured by the local police that
a full investigation will be made into the accident.''
Witnesses suggested that the crash happened when the lorry was
travelling downhill on the wrong side of the road, which is the only
route between Dalaman airport and several resorts on Turkey's Aegean
coast.
Ms Bronwyn Goldblyth, an official of Inspirations Holidays, said: ''I
only have the report from the bus passengers at this stage, and they say
that the lorry driver was coming down the road on the wrong side and
that the bus driver swerved to avoid the lorry. The lorry then went back
on the side of the road it should have been on and hit our coach
head-on.''
All of the bus passengers were taken to hospital for check-ups. It is
understood that Mrs Johnston was released after treatment.
It was believed that all the passengers released from hospital were
continuing with their holidays.
Ms Goldblyth said Inspirations would be pressing the Turkish
authorities ''as hard as it possibly could'' to take action to prevent
another fatal accident on the road.
''Inspirations will be pressing the Turkish Government and the Turkish
tourist board here in Britain and in Turkey because this has happened
once too often.
''I think the Turkish tourist board recognises that this is an issue
-- because tourism is very important to Turkey -- and that it has to do
something about it quickly to prevent any more accidents.
''But I must stress that most people who take their holiday in that
part of Turkey have not been affected.''
* A British tourist died early yesterday after falling from the
balcony of his third-floor hotel room in the southern Turkish resort of
Kalkan, a hotel official said.
Mr Charlie Robertson, 24, from Liverpool, was allegedly drunk at the
time of the accident. He died on the way to hospital.
''He drank too much on Saturday night,'' an official of the Paskalya
Hotel told reporters.
* A taxi and car collided head-on yesterday near Milas in southern
Turkey, killing two French tourists and three Turks.
The Anatolia news agency identified the French victims as Mr Louis
Besse, 45, a captain in the French army, and Ms Catherine Delorge, 30.
The couple arrived in Izmir by plane yesterday and were travelling to
the resort town of Bodrum on the Aegean Sea, the news agency said.

FEW people in Britain will find anything sinister in talks between Sir
Patrick Mayhew and representatives of Sinn Fein, the political surrogate
of the IRA. Nor that the talks have been held in secret should occasion
any wonder: everything in the long march to an enduring peace is bound
to be so sensistive that what used to be called ''open diplomacy'' is
probably impossible. It leads to entrenched position becoming even more
deeply dug. In fact the impasse which has halted the progress towards
permanent peace may even be identified as stemming from public
commitments, of one kind or another, given much earlier and now hardly
capable of being reassessed flexibly. Both sides of the negotiations,
and they remain preliminary to the more complex discussions involving
all parties, are under great pressure. Those on the British Government
are obvious enough but on the Sinn Fein leaders the pressures may only
be guessed at. The latter include a nationalist tradition, more than a
century old, of retaining weapons while being willing to talk. More
important than history may simply be the fact that the IRA does not
trust the appeal to talk and the ballot box. Given all the electoral
evidence we have there is every reason for their attitude: not enough
people vote for them: even within the Catholic community they remain a
minority. Violence and force may seem to get them further.
Yet in the near year in which peace has, more or less, prevailed, its
advantages are obvious. The analysis which led the IRA to ask for talks
is still accurate in its conclusion -- they cannot win what they believe
is a war. They can inflict immense suffering and hardship, and ruin many
lives, including many of those who are their supporters but are crippled
by the cost violence imposes on their personalities, but they cannot
win. Violence can bring them to negotiation tables but it cannot clinch
the arguments once there. Even the British Government could not clinch
the argument by unilateral judgment. The consent of the Unionist parties
and, in contra-distinction to Sinn Fein, the community they represent,
is essential to any agreement about Northern Ireland's future. If they
could ignore weapons for a moment and look to purely political arts,
Irish nationalists would know, what Dublin has long recognised, that the
Unionists have to be wooed. It may be hard for the likes of Messrs Adams
and McGuinness to communicate that to hotter-headed followers, but it is
an inescapable lesson for believers in democracy who notice its salient
characteristics, the supremacy and legitimacy of the majority. Indeed
the IRA does guess that, which is one reason they are always anxious to
change the constituency boundary, so to speak, to ensure that the
Unionists are made a minority.
Elected Governments can afford to be reasonable -- anyone can count a
majority. But purveyors of violence, who owe so much to our
understandable reactions to fear, enjoy no such confidence. They need
their guns much as an infant needs a comforter. It is this lack of
confidence that lies at the heart of the debate on weapons. One way to
end it might be to use neutral countries, acceptable to both sides, to
hold surrendered weapons until an agreement becomes fast, and return
them if it does not. In the meantime, talking cannot be wrong (the
Unionists are mistaken to oppose it), but it will be a tragedy if the
talks merely precede a return to urban guerrilla operations and
sectarian murder.

<HEADLINE>Appeal to gardeners in bid to save peat bogs</HEADLINE>

GARDENERS are to be asked to help save some of Scotland's most
valuable and endangered habitats by boycotting horticultural peat
products.
An international Peatlands Convention, which opens today at the
Edinburgh Conference Centre at Riccarton, will hear calls for the
Government to put into place a positive conservation management strategy
for the UK's raised bogs, and Scotland's in particular.
People will be asked not to buy peat for their gardens so that
commercial peat extractors do not do further damage to peatlands which
are already degrading.
Professor David Bellamy, who will deliver one of the key speeches of
the conference, said: ''I hope a conference of this stature, on our own
doorstep, will bring the message home loud and clear, that we have an
international responsibility to ensure a future for Europe's peat
bogs.''
He will remind delegates that peatlands cover 3% of the planet and
that as ''nature's own sculptured landfill sites'' they have over the
past 10,000 years sequestered 500 billion tonnes of carbon out of the
global greenhouse.
Professor Bellamy will explain that peatlands ''provide a continuum of
unique ecosystems, assemblages of plants and animals which thrive in
waterlogged, nutrient-poor, and often highly acidic conditions, and in
which nutrient retention and efficient recycling are the key to
survival.''
The Scottish Wildlife Trust, which is holding the conference, will be
focusing particularly on the lowland raised bogs of Scotland.
Mr Nigel Doar, the SWT's campaigns co-ordinator, said that only 23,000
hectares of raised bogs remained in Scotland in a near natural state --
less than 9% of its original cover.
''If they are not put into positive conservation management soon, in
50, 100, or 200 years' time, Scotland's raised bogs will be all but
extinct. This is of international importance because Scotland has one of
the highest concentrations of such bogs anywhere in the world. They are
globally rare and endangered,'' he said.
The raised bogs, the most famous of which is at Flander's Moss, near
Stirling, are described by Mr Doar as ''upside-down lakes''.
''They are full of water and everything that lives on them is there
because of that hydrology. If you do anything to damage the trench
patterns this upsets the balance and everything that depends on it risks
dying out,'' said Mr Doar.
Traditionally in Scotland, peatland has been lost from the 1700s
onwards through agricultural practices. But the planting of coniferous
forests -- most notoriously in the Flow Country's blanket bogs -- has
also caused damage.
A new threat is now facing the peatlands of Scotland. Peat extraction
in England and Wales has left the main sites there ''trashed'',
according to Mr Doar. Now he fears that commercial operators will move
to Scotland to cut peat to sell to garden centres.
''Now that the English have realised this was a bad idea, they have
stopped granting planning permission and the peat industry is looking
north of the Border. We have what is going to be an up-and-coming
threat, and some areas are already threatened,'' he said.

Those with wealth and those with a wealth of adventure are equally
welcome on the Greek island of Mykonos reports Sandra Mitchell
THE buildings are what strike you first on Mykonos. The simple cuboid
houses are so dazzlingly white they might have been hewn from blocks of
virgin snow.
On seeing them the architect Le Corbusier is said to have exclaimed:
''Whatever architecture has to say, it has said here.'' The pure blues,
reds and greens of their wooden doors, shutters, balustrades and
balconies come straight from a child's paintbox. The riotous purples and
pinks of the bougainvillaea and rose bushes trained around them complete
a scene that leaves the newly arrived Scot, more used to the muted tones
of sandstone viewed through a veil of rain, squinting disbelievingly in
the glare.
Despite its rocky landscape and relative lack of greenery, Mykonos is
one of the most attractive -- and genuinely friendly -- of the Greek
islands. Situated in the Cyclades between the much larger Tinos and
Naxos, it is a favourite with everyone from impoverished backpackers,
who camp beside its clean white beaches, to those used to a more
luxurious holiday style, including pop singer Madonna and former
American president George Bush.
Mykonos town is home to the majority of the island's 4000 or so
permanent residents as well as many of its temporary visitors. A former
pirate stronghold, which at various points in its long and turbulent
history also fell into Venetian, Turkish and Russian hands, the shops
and houses huddle along a maze of narrow alleyways paved with uneven
cobbles outlined in whitewash. (Friday is painting day when residents of
all ages emerge, filled with civic pride and armed with large brushes,
to carry out running repairs.)
Here visitors can stroll, hindered only by the occasional sunbathing
cat or donkey come to town to sell a colourful array of vegetables and
flowers from its creaking wicker baskets, and admire a range of shops
worthy of Bond Street of Fifth Avenue.
You want gold rings? Bracelets and necklaces encrusted with precious
stones? The latest designs by Donna Karan or Calvin Klein? Sunglasses
signed by Giorgio Armani? Haagen Dazs ice-cream or nut-filled pastries
dripping with honey? This is the place to find them -- and the doors
stay open until 11 or 12 at night.
For those too tired or poor to shop (Mykonos is one of the more
expensive Greek islands), the cafes clustered around the harbour are the
perfect spot for people watching.
During the day an armada of gleaming cruise ships disgorge their cargo
of tourists wearing formica badges proclaiming their name and place of
origin, while at night the beautiful people emerge to parade up and down
in their holiday finery before heading off to what are renowned to be
some of the best nightclubs in Europe. Among the most fabulous
promenaders are the transvestites who appear from time to time in
extravagant wigs, silk basques and high heels.
On Mykonos even dogs -- of which there are many -- dress for dinner in
dapper neckerchiefs of red, blue or green. But beware as you sit quietly
sipping your cappuccino or bottled German beer -- not all the wildlife
is friendly. Petros, the island's famous pelican, will brook no
obstacle. Woe betide anyone who tries to impede his progress as he
marches straight through cafes and restaurants on large webbed feet.
The town itself has no beaches to speak of but there are several to
choose from, all within easy reach by hired car or moped. For the more
adventurous, a short ride courtesy of one of the island's kamikaze bus
drivers will take you to Plati Yialos. Here you can hop aboard one of
the cheerfully painted little fishing boats. The skippers supplement
their income by ferrying tourists to the long stretches of sand nestling
between the steep cliffs of the south coast.
The best of these is the grandly dubbed Super Paradise. Here, as on
all Mykonos's beaches, swimwear is optional. The weather can be breezy,
although this can be a welcome relief when the sun is at its height.
For those who enjoy more cultural pursuits, there is a small municipal
art gallery and excellent archaeological, folk and maritime museums --
the last of these including a model of the steamer Cape Ortegal,
launched from Port Glasgow in 1911. The distinctive windmills and the
countless tiny chapels which dot the countryside are also well worth
exploring, as is the sleepy village of Ano Mera with its beautiful
monastery and church decorated with golden icons and vast chandeliers.
For film buffs, the beach taverna at Agios Yannis where Pauline
Collins's Shirley Valentine admired the sunset and fell for the dubious
charms of Tom Conti makes another interesting excursion.
Mykonos is also ideally placed for day trips to neighbouring islands
including Delos, one of Greece's more fascinating archaeological sites.
Reputed to be the birthplace of Apollo, it was once an important Aegean
trading point with up to 10,000 slaves changing hands each day before
being shipped out never to return.
Today's visitors are much more likely to go back, drawn year after
year by the warm Mykonian welcome and the island's unique blend of
bustle and tranquillity.
* How to get there: fly direct to Mykonos from Gatwick, or from
Glasgow to Athens and then by plane (30 minutes), hydrofoil (three
hours) or ferry (six hours).

Christopher Portway visits two streetwise cities
MANCHESTER may not leap to mind as the most obvious of tourist
destinations, even to northerners, whose capital it presumes to be. It
is safe to say that the rest of the country thinks of Greater Manchester
as no more than a conurbation of industrial towns.
Conurbation it is, with Manchester proper as its financial, business
and cultural centre which embraces its immediate neighbour Salford,
still anomalously a separate city. Greater Manchester, however, does
embody a dozen surrounding towns of the likes of Oldham, Bolton,
Stockport and Rochdale though all are individually managed and
geographically detached.
Despite its ancient origins the city is essentially a creation of the
Industrial Revolution from the time it was regional capital of the
Lancashire cotton-manufacturing area.
Architecturally, Manchester is a Victorian city and some of its best
buildings belong to that period. The town hall is one of England's
finest -- walk down any street and you will see beautiful and impressive
buildings.
Arriving at Piccadilly station, however, your first impression of the
city will be disappointing. It takes a while to discover those
magnificent edifices, the multiple shopping centres and a plethora of
unique concert halls, theatres, libraries, museums and galleries.
Likewise, Manchester is loathe to wear its heart on its sleeve. One
has to search to find that it's a literary city with a great newspaper
heritage, a railway city, a city of canals, a city that has bounced back
from the abyss of defunct industrial might to conquer new fields.
For the tourist there is a wealth of attractions from the Granada film
and TV studios, containing the set of Coronation Street, through the
exciting Museum of Science and Industry, to the Chinese Arts Centre,
reflecting the activities and skills of the largest Chinese community in
Britain.
The city is justly proud of its new electrically-powered Supertram
system, Metrolink, the first of its kind in Europe. Out of the centre
these comfortable, smooth-running vehicles run at high speed to take you
into or out of the city in minutes.
And what a lot Greater Manchester has to offer. Rochdale, for
instance, lies north. Its well known Gracie Fields connection is
celebrated but not overpoweringly in a small museum, many of the shops
and service emporiums are connected by covered ways, and its mighty town
hall is more magnificent even than that of Manchester itself.
And with Rochdale you are at the gateway to the Pennine Edge and the
picturesque Saddleworth countryside replete with weaver cottages and
steam-powered woollen mills nestling in deep valleys cleaving the high
moorland.
Much further north, on the east coast of Scotland, relatively few
visitors turn their inquisitive footsteps towards Aberdeen, Scotland's
third city and Britain's third largest fishing port. The ''granite
city'' explains itself when you observe the buildings of massive grey
blocks everywhere. Yet surprisingly this solid metropolis, farther north
than Moscow, is anything but sombre.
One reason for this is the city's love affair with flowers. About a
million roses plus other blooms such as daffodils and crocuses flourish
in such profusion that Aberdeen has won the coveted Britain-in-Bloom
trophy half a dozen times.
Oil, of course, is what Aberdeen has been about of late and the stuff
turned it into something of a boom city. This resulted in a considerable
increase and improvement in the city's facilities and services from
which the casual visitor benefits as much as the businessmen.
Union Street, the main thoroughfare, is a broad, straight mile of
handsome Regency houses in which flecks of mica make the silver-grey
granite glitter in the sunlight. Pipe band concerts, dances,
folk-singing evenings and other entertainments are frequently staged in
Union Terrace Gardens during the summer.
Parks and museums abound and though some hotels and restaurants cater
for the business fraternity on expense accounts there are also many more
down-to-earth equivalents of firmly Scottish aspirations to cater for
the likes of you and me.
It's a pleasure to find that two very different cities of Britain hide
a tourism potential that is quickly becoming apparent.

* A Scot has appealed to the European Parliament to end six years of
secrecy surrounding his father's death.
Mr Eddie McColm says his family will never come to terms with the road
accident that killed his father, James, until they know the full facts.
He says he knows his father was knocked down by a taxi while he was
crossing Townhead Street, in Stevenston, Ayrshire. Mr McColm, 69, was
taken to hospital suffering from extensive head and legs injuries, but
died two days later, in July 1989.
Mr McColm Jr claims the Crown Office's failure to supply investigation
reports contravenes European law.
He says it is breaking Article 10 of the Council of Europe's
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,
which provides the right to receive and impart information.

Environmentally, there's a lot of biodiversity and sustainability
about these days. These two concepts came to the fore with Rio and the
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in
1992.
As part of these deliberations the first global consensus on the
management of the world's forests was reached. Then, within Europe, four
specifically forestry resolutions were agreed at Helsinki in 1993.
The Department of Environment has taken the leading role in
progressing these broad political statements into practical policies.
Overall their UK Action Plan has 59 objectives. Nine of these relate
specifically to forestry.
Phil Ratliffe is head of the Forestry Authority's Environment Branch,
and represents the Forestry Commission in these discussions on the DOEs
32-member Action Group. ''We cannot expand the nation's biodiversity by
simply looking at threatened species and special sites,'' he says.
''While these play an important role there remains the whole of the
wider countryside where land is managed mainly in agriculture and
forestry. There is enormous potential for delivering multiple benefits.
As you know we have re-stated forest policy in terms of sustainability
and multiple benefits. Our Biodiversity Initiative is looking very much
at forests which have previously been managed primarily for commercial
reasons, and the opportunities they present to expand their levels of
biodiversity.''
The present guidelines -- such as for nature conservation, landscape
design, water -- which, although they are not mandatory, have set the
standards for forestry in Britain. A woodland grant scheme will not be
approved if it does not meet the conditions, for example, of the water
guidelines.
''There has been some criticism, and I think justifiably so,'' says
Phil Ratcliffe, ''that the present guidelines are very qualitative --
there is not much quantification. There are well-meaning statements such
as 'we would like to see more dead wood, and more decaying wood in
forests.' We are now being asked to be more specific: such as, how many
cubic metres of different types of dead wood are required?''
Once biodiversity standards have been established it is the intention
to develop monitoring systems to measure the degree to which the
standards are being achieved.
''These are topics,'' says Phil Ratcliffe, ''which have become the
focus of the post-Helsinki deliberations. We have been in discussions
with a number of countries, both inside and outside Europe, to develop
criteria, then indicators, to measure sustainability. Considerable
progress has been made. In Europe there is now general acceptance of a
set of indicators that they are technically feasible/scientifically
valid/ and cost-effective. Willie Sheridan, the chairman of the European
Forestry Commission, has been leading these deliberations.''
Mr Ratcliffe finds it surprising that some foresters even today
believe that sustained yield is the same as sustainable forestry. ''The
two things are very different. You can demonstrate sustained yield in
terms of the input equalling the output, but when we talk about
sustainable forest management in the widest context, we are talking
about the sustainable delivery of all of the multiple objectives of
forestry. For example, we can look at the sustainability of the soil
resource: are we actually depleting soil nutrients through time? Again,
are we sustaining biodiversity?''
The nine forestry objectives identified in the Action Plan are: the
implementation of the biodiversity aspects of the UK sustainable
forestry programme; the encouragement of forms of management to conserve
ancient and semi-natural woodlands; the need to encourage the
regeneration of woodlands; the need to restructure even-aged plantations
to create more varied forests; the need to continue to encourage the
steady expansion of woodland forest cover; the extension and creation of
native woodlands, including the areas of FC Caledonian forest; the need
to support community woodlands near population centres; the need to
support of the National Forest in the English midlands and the creation
of multi-purpose woodlands in Scotland's central belt, through the
Central Scotland Countryside Trust's activities; and the need is
recognised to encourage urban tree planting and care through research
and support of voluntary organisations.

A PRIVATE prosecution might be brought against a Spanish journalist
involved in a fatal crash in the Highlands during a test drive of a new
Jaguar.
The Crown Office has decided not to proceed with a charge of causing
death by dangerous driving against Del Castillo Jarabo. It says there is
insufficient evidence.
The Madrid journalist was at Skibo Castle in Sutherland 10 months ago
for the launch of the new XJ6.
He was driving the car along a narrow road, two miles from Alness in
Easter Ross, when he collided with a saloon car driven by a 74-year-old
crofter, John Munro.
Mr Munro died and Caroline Woodward, who had been living with him in
his home at Oldshoremore, near Cape Wrath, escaped with cuts and
bruises.
Miss Woodward has since had to leave the croft she had shared with Mr
Munro because his only will, written in 1968, left the house to a
nephew.
She said yesterday: ''I am stunned that there will be no prosecution.
My solicitor is investigating a private prosecution, but I don't know
whether or not I will be able to afford it.
''But if I got legal aid, then I would certainly want it to go to
court. That Jaguar came hurtling towards us and the accident has ruined
my life.''
Neither Mr Jarabo or Jaguar would comment on the Crown's decision.

JOHN Daly, very much the enfant terrible of the US Tour, shook the
world of golf when in 1991, he emerged from total obscurity to win the
US PGA title. At St Andrews yesterday he stirred it by capturing the
124th Open Championship, soundly beating the Italian Costantino Rocca,
after a four-hole play-off.
The two players had tied with 72-hole totals of 282, six under par,
over an Old Course ravaged by wind with respective final rounds of 71
and 73, Rocca's shot to tie having been achieved in as melodramatic a
way as can ever have been witnessed in the long and ancient history of
the headquarters of the game.
But the play-off itself, conducted over the first, second,
seventeenth, and eighteenth holes as the gale which had gusted to 35mph
subsided in the evening sunshine, was a severe anti-climax for the many
spectators who hoped that Rocca would ensure that America's recent
victory drought in this championship lasted for another year.
Instead Daly, aged 29, became the seventh player from the United
States to win the Open at St Andrews in 14 attempts since the First
World War when he took the venerable claret jug and the first prize of
#125,000 by no fewer than four strokes, 15-19 on aggregate.
Rocca, aged 37, who came to professional golf comparatively late in
life, was halted in his tracks when he took three putts at the first,
having overrun the hole by six feet, to go 4-5 behind and when Daly ran
in an unlikely 40-footer for a birdie at the next to win 3-4, the margin
had increased two.
The end came for the amply-built Rocca at the third extra hole. The
Road Bunker, the nemesis of so many ambitions over the years, gathered
another victim in its embrace when Rocca's second shot finished under
the face and he needed three more to extracate himself. Daly's carefully
crafted approach from the rough on to the green won him the seventeenth
by 4-7.
The last thus became routine, although Rocca put a slightly better
complexion on his defeat with a birdie 3 to Daly's 4.
Daly said afterwards: ''I was disappointed when Rocca's putt went in,
but Corey Pavin, Brad Faxon, and Bob Estes told me I could do it.
Muirfield in 1992, when I finished last, was a tough initiation for me,
but I proved the next year at Royal St George's (where he was equal
fourteenth) that I was improving at this style of golf.
''There was more pressure on me than in 1991, when I didn't think I
could win the US PGA -- and neither did anyone else.''
Daly also paid tribute to the part played in his rehabilitation by
wife Paulette, whom he married earlier this year. He said: ''She's very
special and she's been through a lot with me. I love her more than golf
and we have a wonderful little baby girl. She'd better get ready as
we'll definitely have a lot more.
''I did not get to sleep until 3.30 this morning. We watched a couple
of movies and I played the guitar a bit. This morning I had about 10
croissants with chocolate in them, and some eggs, to help while away the
time before I teed off.''
Rocca consoled himself with the knowledge that his second prize of
#100,000 ensured he had retained his European Ryder Cup team place. ''It
wasn't easy to marshall my thoughts after that putt and I knew I was up
against it in the play-off because Daly hits the ball so far.
''Those three putts on the first green gave me the feeling it wasn't
going to be my day and Daly's birdie at the next confirmed it. When my
second at the next went into the bunker, I really did have that sinking
feeling.''
Daly's troubled life, into which he has packed divorce, drink, and
drug problems, and suspension from the US Tour after having been
involved in a brawl, will surely be stabilised by this most rewarding
experience.
That this outcome, only the second since the reduced and immediate
play-off system was introduced in 1985, was necessary came at the end of
a tumultuous afternoon, during which the ferocity of the westerly wind,
buffeting the competitors on the exposed and firm greens and hard and
running fairways, had really too much influence to allow skill to
outplay endurance.
It seemed as if Daly had the title for the taking when, with only
three holes to play, he led by three strokes from Michael Campbell and
Rocca, two games behind, and from Steve Elkington who was in the
penultimate pair, and Steven Bottomley who, in the by now well-tried
phrase, had risen without trace eventually to share third place.
But the tail of the course wagged in the most dramatic manner. Daly
dropped one stroke by three-putting the sixteenth. From his next drive
pulled into the rough, the ball fell under the vertical face of the Road
Bunker and having had to play well away from the flagstick, two putts
from 30 feet gathered in a commonplace bogey.
When Daly's last approach was not close enough to give him a plausible
chance of a birdie to soften the cushion to a two-stroke lead and the
bogeys of Campbell and Elkington at the sixteenth and seventeenth
respectively eliminated them from the championship's climax, Rocca
became the last remaining threat.
But even he must have thought his last hope had gone when his second,
also from rough, ran over the seventeenth green on to the tarmac of the
road beyond. Instead, he improvised such a remarkable shot with his
putter that the ball, lofted as in a chip, finished only four feet from
the hole.
That par saved, Rocca had to birdie the last, 354-yard long but,
downwind, within driving distance all week. Rocca's tee shot came up
short of the Valley of Sin and then disaster seemed about to prevail
over that other great imposter, triumph. After a lengthy reconnaissance
Rocca hit the ground behind the ball which rolled ignominiously into
that famous depression.
The collective intake of breath was similar to that taken when Doug
Sanders had that awful four-foot miss which ultimately cost him the 1970
Open. But the roar, echoed even by those hardened and sceptical
inhabitants of the media centre, which greeted the next shot was as
resoundingly rendered.
After Rocca, probably with the hopes and fears of every Italian in or
out of captivity riding on the shot, holed out from some 35 feet for the
birdie 3 which sent the championship into this first form of decision
since 1989 when the last American to win, Mark Calcavecchia, beat the
two Australians, Greg Norman and Wayne Grady, at Royal Troon.
In his valedictory assessment of the outcome after he had made what is
expected to be his last regular appearance in the championship, Jack
Nicklaus identified the qualities that the winner would need --
patience, course management, and, not least, guts, all of which in his
prime, Nicklaus had in abundance himself.
Daly he tended to discount because the wind was his fellow American's
most hostile opponent given the height of his shots.
Astonishly the leading British player was Bottomley, a 30-year-old
Yorkshireman who in 20 tournaments this season has missed 11 cuts and
withdrawn twice.

WHO knows but something useful might yet come out of Bosnia. Recent
events in the escalating tragedy have demonstrated conclusively the
European Union's inability to solve conflicts on its own doorstep. The
lesson has been learned the hard way, through embarrassment at its own
impotence at a time when some member states still harbour grand
ambitions for a 21st century European super state. The French have a
phrase for this abrupt cooling of excited passions: the douche
Ecossaise. The timing is useful, too, because the Bosnian failure will
constrain the wilder ambitions of Germany and some others in foreign and
defence policy when the European Union meets next year to review the
Maastricht Treaty. A new realism is being recognised.
Perhaps ''review'' is too strong a word for the 1996
inter-governmental conference which is being billed as a super-summit
and one which could map the course of European integration for a
generation. Indeed this exercise might be called ''taking stock'' if the
phrase was not so devalued in Scotland. Sometimes it is forgotten that
the 1996 ''review'' was built into Maastricht during the original
negotiation for the sound reason that the treaty is so complicated that
the need to control its consequences is vital. Thus the talks next year
are not intended to be a further great leap into federalism. Rather they
are an opportunity to check if the treaty as now constituted works
efficiently. The consensus in the EU is that it patently does not. In a
community of, say, 25 it would produce chaos.
At most we can expect a review of voting procedures although demands
for an end to the national veto are fast disappearing in several
countries, to the delight of the British Tories. A little trimming of
some countries' right to block for ever the sensible and prevailing
views of the majority in foreign affairs and defence, home affairs and
justice, might be in order. But there will be no EU-driven binding
foreign policy, no EU Army to which national armed forces must offer a
salute.
The importance of this new realism, born of Bosnia, is that it will
allow the EU to concentrate on its most pressing challenge which is the
absorption of the ex-Communist states of central and Eastern Europe and,
most immediately, how to pay for it. Everyone is agreed that the EU
needs to accommodate countries like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, as well as the Baltic states and all
the others in the queue. Such a daunting economic revolution can only be
achieved in stages and at huge cost.
Where will the money come from? The question is so obvious and the
answer is so suspiciously simplistic: it must come from the Common
Agricultural Policy which -- scandalously -- still takes up about half
of all spending in the European Union. The Germans, as paymasters of the
EU, support the idea but no-one can tell how German public opinion will
react when CAP payments tail off. Jacques Chirac's support for eastwards
enlargement will also be tested by his farmers, one of the most
notoriously militant lobbies in the world. Bringing in perhaps 10 poor
states, all in need of huge structural aid, at a time when the EU is
still in the economic doldrums and suffering mass unemployment, is a
task to make any political leader wilt. But it has to be done to
underpin the new democratic order. Easing the political aspects of this
transition requires a more workable Maastricht Treaty in which voting is
streamlined in the name of efficiency while national interests are
respected. Settling those awkward questions will be quite enough to keep
the EU going until the end of the century without worrying too much
about phantom military and diplomatic might.

IN the late 1950s when we who are no longer young were playing rugby,
the field and behaving generally as though tomorrow would look after
itself, The Farmer and his pal Jonnie Moffett, two athletes for sure,
played in a remarkable match in Edinburgh. At least, the warm-up that
the two athletes put themselves through was something else.
Friday was the night of the Arts ball at Aberdeen's beach ballroom. It
didn't stop till 4am and that gave the heroes two hours to kill before
catching the train for the capital. Sleep was out of the question, so a
party was arranged at a team-mates flat.
At about six in the morning we boarded the train and were looking for
somewhere to get a night's sleep in the three hours journey when we came
upon the thing we needed least. There was a fully stocked bar with a
barman behind it.
I can honestly say that I don't remember having any other drink that
night, but it was so unusual. In those days when bars shut at 9.30, to
find one open out of hours, that we did have a night cap, or was it two?
At any rate five minutes into the game, which started at eleven, we
got a penalty wide out on the left. That was the position from which
Moffett later scored six of his points for Ireland against England in
Dublin, so we had every chance of success.
And yet, as he set the ball up, I felt there was something wrong. I
ran up to him to see if I could help and sure enough I could. Our man
set the ball perfectly to kick a goal on the next pitch.
I got him squared up and, in fact, he kicked the goal which gave us a
three-each draw against the young veterinarians in the Royal Dick
College.
I tell you all that because, 35 years older, he came to visit us last
week. Jonnie now farms in New Zealand where the Government abolished all
farm subsidies eight years ago and I was interested to hear from someone
who had been through that what it was like.
Nearly every farmer I meet nowadays says ''It canna last''. These are
good times we are having, they all agree, but they are dependent on a
heap of money being thrown at us by the Common Agricultural Policy.
There is bound to be a taxpayer's revolt and it is likely to be sooner
rather than later.
So they all say and they may be right, though for many of them it will
be the first time.
First of all, these good-times we are enjoying aren't that good.
Farm incomes in Scotland, according to the Ministry of Agriculture,
are the highest since 1977. But surely that isn't very good. Alright
1977 may have been a good year too but most people expect to get a bit
richer year by year.
To put that statistic another way: ''Even though farm incomes are up
this year they have not yet reached the levels they were at 18 years
ago.'' Is there another sector of industry or sector of the population
who have done as badly as the farmers?
I doubt it, and remember that something like half the businesses which
enjoyed that good year in 1977 have left the industry since then. And,
if you know farmers, you will know how many of those left by choice.
The New Zealanders used to have a highly subsidised industry and then,
eight years ago, all at once with no messing about with transitional
periods, they gave them all up at once. Farmers were thrown on to the
world market.
It was horrendous. Prices crashed and so did the one third of the
farming businesses. Support groups were set up to help farmers come to
terms, not with just being broke, but with having lost the family acres.
And yet, my old pal tells me, ''It would be hard to find a farmer in
New Zealand who would like to go back to subsidies.''
I'll need to watch not to put words into Jonnie's mouth so this is my
interpretation of how it benefited the successful New Zealand farmers to
give up their Government support.
While one third of the farmers went out of farming, they didn't take
their land with them. The flood of farms on to the market meant the
strong and the ambitious could get on and expand and there was plenty of
cheap land available.
I am happy with Little Ardo but, if the same happened here, the whizz
kids, like Red Rooster and Mossie, would be able to get into some real
acreages.
When Government support was withdrawn Jonnie was able to buy some
first-rate land and get going with building up his fruit and veg growing
business which sees him gallivanting round the world selling carrot
juice to Japan, and onions and apples to the UK.
When pressed, Moffett, who is vice-president of the New Zealand Apple
and Pear Board as well a farmer, says that the main disadvantage of
subsidies is that they can be cut from under you at any time so you
can't plan ahead.
That's true, of course, but the same would be true of cutting off your
legs. Once it is done it can't happen again so you can safely sell the
shoes.
I was able to tell him that subsidies were equal to 73% of farm
profits in 1994 and the two just about balanced in 1993.
That money may make us inefficient, it may stop Mossie getting another
farm, but it is keeping Little Ardo in business and that will be
important to me, even when it's Potions' bank account that it affects.

SCOTLAND imports around 75% of its food supplied while about 70% of
its food production is exported. This imbalance between food production
and consumption in Scotland is partly because of the size of the value
added food processing sector in relation to primary production.
Consequently exports tend to include relatively lightly processed
foods while imports tend to have received more processing. The food
processing industry in Scotland largely comprises small companies,
typically with less than 50 employees. Scottish food does, however, have
an image of good quality and smaller companies tend to supply more
innovative products.
There is no doubt that eating habits are changing and the consumption
of pre-prepared food is increasing and seems to continue to do so.
Rather more meals are eaten out of the home and those eaten in the home
are less often prepared from raw ingredients.
The future therefore seems set towards an increase in food processing
activity, particularly towards supplying foodstuffs to the catering
trade. Hence there is a clear need to encourage the food processing
sector and in Scotland there is great potential to replace imports. The
importance of food processing has been recognised by the Government.
The Ministry of Agriculture has recently established an initiative to
help smaller companies access technical information through local food
innovation and technology centres. Three of these have been established
in England, in Humberside, Shropshire, and Plymouth and one is being
established in Scotland.
The Scottish centre is a combined venture drawing on the resources of
SAC, The University of Glasgow, The University of Strathclyde, and the
Hannah Research Institute. The concept underlying the centre is that it
will be able to act as a technical resource for smaller companies who do
not have easy access to the resources enjoyed by large food producers.
In effect, it will represent a single point of contact for dealing
with technical issues relating to food products. Through networking
arrangements with the other centres in England and through access to
databases in the Research Associations the centre will ensure that
companies receive the best and most up-to-date information.
The activities of the centre will range from training in the form of
generic training courses and tailor-made courses for companies through
to detailed advice on food hygiene, process development and
implementation of legislation.
Research within the partner organisations will reflect the needs of
the local food industry and will encourage involvement of companies
through the needs of the local food industry and will encourage
involvement of companies through European and UK Government schemes such
as Craft and Link.
Scotland has a justified quality image for food production and needs
to develop the manufacturing sector to retain more of the value of its
produce in Scotland. Small companies can effectively exploit niche
markets through innovation but to remain competitive need local access
to technical expertise.
The Ministry initiative for food technology transfer centres will help
make sure that the innovative flair of small enteprises is complemented
by sound food technology.

A MUCH-TOUTED Norwegian protest against French nuclear testing --
sparked by Nottingham forest midfielder Lars Bohinen -- turned into a
whimper on Saturday as Norway and France drew 0-0 in Oslo.
Bohinen had announced he would boycott the match in protest at
France's atomic policies -- and he was backed by the Norwegian players'
council, led by team captain and goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt. But the
other players shied away from protests of their own on the pitch,
apparently after a warning from FIFA not to mix sport and politics.
Most of the 12,030 spectators brandished leaflets with ''Non'' printed
inside a nuclear mushroom cloud as the French national anthem was played
before the start of the match.

CHARITIES look set to receive decreasing sums of money over the coming
years from companies partly because of the collapse of the UK's most
generous giver -- Barings merchant bank.
According to Corporate Citizen magazine, companies donated #114m to
charity last year, an increase of #8.4m in 1993, although the trend
seems highly likely to fall after the UK's oldest merchant bank was
brought to its knees in late February.
Last year it gave #12m to charity, almost double that of its nearest
rival Glaxo which gave #6.5m and almost three times as much as Marks &amp;
Spencer (#4.4m) and Grand Metropolitan (#4.8m).
Almost three quarters of the companies in the Corporate Citizen Top
100 donators increased their gifts in 1994.
The biggest risers included Carlton Communications (271%), Co-Op Bank
(212%), Weetabix (133%), Tomkins (118%), and S G Warburg (117%) before
its takeover.
New entries included Body Shop (#771,861), ScottishPower (#591,895),
Kwik Fit (#400,000) and Iceland Group (#360,000).
In contrast the National Grid Company halved donations, ICI cut its
handouts by a quarter and BP imposed its third successive cut.
British Gas gave 35% less in donations and halved its total community
support from #10m to #5m.
BT retained its position as the UK's most generous community
supporter, with #15m worth of total community contributions, followed by
NatWest Bank and Barclays, which provided #11.6m and #7.5m support to
the community in 1994.

HE WENT out the way he came in, did the week's Scottish hero, Gordon
Sherry, who maintained the endearing self-confidence that has seen him
through the world's toughest championship with some style.
He may be the Amateur champion, but there is nothing amateurish about
either his play or attitude. Sherry finished his last round yesterday
with a 76 for 291, which is three over par, and two strokes behind
England's Steve Webster, who won the Silver Medal as leading amateur.
''I am not disappointed at missing the amateur medal,'' said the
Kilmarnock lad, ''but I am disappointed at the way I played in the last
two days.''
The 21-year-old, who was cheered with a volume of Hampden proportions
when he came up the last hole, then considered it was time for a more
positive approach. He said: ''Hopefully, I'll come back in the year 2000
as the world's No.1. That's definitely my goal.''
He went on to point out that he has not had time to celebrate becoming
Amateur champion, or winning the European team title. It is going to be
a long celebration now, after all that has happened here and at
Carnoustie last week.
Sherry intends to have three weeks off and may not play in the
Scottish Amateur championship. He will play in the Canadian Amateur
championship in August, and then rest again before the Walker Cup.
The wind took its toll on everyone, including Sam Torrance, who shot a
final round of 74 to be leading Scot at two under par for the
tournament. But he knows he was in with a real chance of winning. At one
point he got to five under.
''I was in the thick of it from the off, but I three-putted at the
eighth, ninth, and thirteenth. Andrew Coltart, who also had a good
tournament, was very disappointed at three-putting five times. The
Thornhill man finished with a 73 for a level-par 288 total, two ahead of
Ross Drummond, who closed with a fine one-under 71.
All in all, the home lot, with the unexpected exception of our No.1,
Colin Montgomerie, had a few good days out on the Fife coast. Didn't we
all?

Corazon Aquino calls on women to ensure the Beijing forum spurs change
ONE sign that the world takes women's needs and concerns seriously is
that in Beijing this September the United Nations will hold its fourth
world conference since 1975 to plan action for women's advancement.
Women are gradually being recognised as active and vital partners in
political, economic, and social development. But disparities remain.
While legislation promoting gender equality has been enacted,
discriminatory laws amended, and new measures introduced to cover the
rights of women, governments still need to translate these commitments
into action.
In education, studies show higher numbers of illiterate women than men
in the world, and the literacy gap between men and women is widening. At
the tertiary level, courses often reflect gender stereotypes, with men
dominating enrolments in engineering and law, for example, and women
studying nutrition or nursing skills -- seen as extensions of their
household duties.
In non-formal education or skills training, women gravitate toward
service, sales, clerical work, and cottage industries, whereas men take
agricultural and production-related training courses. The result is that
women wind up with less competitive job skills and lower wages than men.
In the Philippines, where women have greater than average access to
higher education, their access to employment opportunities remains
limited. A major cause is the traditional attitude that women should not
work but should only keep house, and that their work -- when they do
find employment -- is marginal and dispensable.
Working women too face many obstacles. They lag behind in terms of
equal pay for equal work, access to positions of power, and equitable
promotion rates. Because of their lack of high-level skills, women are
almost always the first to be replaced by new labour-saving
technologies. And women are usually the first to be let go when
companies cut staffing.
Many women today are torn between the slowly increasing opportunities
for economic and personal advancement, and their traditional
gender-based duties at home.
Given the rising phenomenon of double-income households, it is
important that both men and women share more equitably in
decision-making, housework, and raising children in the family.
As expressed by the Jakarta Declaration on the Advancement of Women:
''Instead of being a hierarchical structure of domination and
subordination, of control and subservience, the family then becomes a
closely knit kin-group of caring individuals where burdens and
responsibilities are equitably shared and equal partnership between men
and women is ensured''.
Transplanted into the global setting, this concept will foster a more
democratic structure wherein more women are elected to positions of
power, participate in decision-making at all levels, nationally and
internationally, and are given control of, and access to, economic and
natural resources.
In these ways, women will then be equal partners with men and share
equitably in the responsibilities of nation building.
It is therefore also important that policies and programmes, laws, and
measures governing the rights of women be fully implemented.
Women must learn to maintain the balance between rights and
responsibilities. We must insist on being treated as equal partners, for
in this way we can truly be effective and productive citizens; in this
way we can truly change the world.
* Corazon Aquino was President of the Philippines between 1986-1992.

A 21-YEAR-OLD British soldier has died from gunshot wounds in Bosnia a
few weeks after being home on leave. Private Dale Little, from
Catchgate, near Annfield Plain, County Durham, was not under fire when
he was fatally wounded and foul play was not suspected, said the
Ministry of Defence.
Private Little, who served with the Royal Logistics Corps, died on
Saturday a result of gunshot wounds to his neck. An Army investigation
is in progress.

<TEXT>
A MINISTRY of Defence report claims that thousands of depleted uranium
shells fired from two test ranges do not present a danger to the public.
A five-month study has been completed on the DU trials at the
Dundrennan range in Kirkcudbright and Eskmeals in Cumbria.
The report says the overall findings are that doses to members of the
public and the associated risk from exposure to DU are estimated to be
extremely low.
''The primary aim of the report was to assess the impact of the DU
trials on the local communities and to evaluate the adequacy of the
existing environmental monitoring programmes and site action levels.
''This is clearly good news and the report also concluded that there
was no evidence to suggest there was any significant risk to the public
or site personnel,'' states the Ministry.
The tests at the 4500-acre range at Dundrennan have continued since
1981 and it is estimated that more than 4000 DU shells have been fired
there.
The Dundrennan range is being run down over the next three years and
much of the equipment will be moved. Work is underway to decommission
the equipment which will be moved to Eskmeals where the DU tests will be
concentrated in future.
DU shells were used widely during the Gulf war and claims have been
made that coalition troops fighting in the conflict could have been
affected by the firing of the shells.
Despite the claims in the United States and Britain, the Government
and Ministry of Defence have consistently said that DU shells have not
been the cause of illness.
A total of 18.1 tonnes of depleted uranium rounds have been test-fired
at the Dundrennan range, mostly into the sea. But despite costly
searches mounted by the ministry, using divers, submersibles, and a
special ship, no shells have been recovered from the Solway Firth.
Scientists have been anxious to trace the shells from the sea to try
to learn what reaction the sea water has on depleted uranium, whether it
affects marine life, and the condition of the projectile after being
submerged for long periods.

''HE smiled and he wiped away all the years,'' said Jimmy Logan,
relating an anecdote about Eisenhower, and he showed off a slide of
himself and the President taken in the United States. It's a description
which could as easily be applied to Logan himself.
Age has certainly not diminished him; he's still as handsome as the
film footage of him as a lad about town in the Scottish feature film
Floodtide.
This show represents a hop, skip, and jump down memory lane, with
Logan roamin' through the gloamin', and his extensive personal
collection of theatrical memorabilia, showing slides and rare archive
film footage -- Robert Wilson singing Hail Caledonia, and Sir Harry
Lauder doing a skit in the 1930s -- and illustrating them with a mixture
of professional reverence and whimsical anecdote.
The respectful homage to the various members of the Royal Family Logan
has hobnobbed with, perhaps indicates wistful aspirations for a
knighthood, but an element of name-dropping is inevitable in describing
a career which has been quite star-studded.
It's a magical performance which effectively communicates the romance
and glamour of a by-gone era.

The plight of the Bosnian Muslims has stretched the patience of
Islamic countries with the West over the arms embargo. Money is on its
way and it seems military hardware could follow.
THE United Arab Emirates has donated #6.88m to Bosnia.
An official said the donation was made ''to help end the human tragedy
and genocide and assist the Bosnian people to defend themselves.''
The official said the donation was also meant to ''help the people of
Bosnia ease their suffering in the face of abuses and the policy of
ethnic cleansing and aggression undertaken by the (Bosnian) Serbs
against innocent civilians.''
The UAE, together with fellow Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) members
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain, have been strong
political and financial backers of Bosnian Muslims.
The GCC has often called on Western allies to lift the UN arms embargo
on the Muslim Bosnian Government to allow it to counter Serb attacks.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati has confirmed that foreign
ministers of Islamic countries pledged in a private meeting in Geneva
last week to give military assistance to Bosnian Muslims.
Another senior Iranian official, parliament speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nuri, sharply criticised Friday's London conference on Bosina,
saying on Sunday that it had given Bosnia's Serbs a green light to
continue attacks against Muslims.
Velayati, in remarks made on Saturday and quoted by Iran radio, said:
''At its meeting, the Islamic contact group openly stressed that Bosnia
has the right, like any other country, to defend itself and to have
weapons.''
The foreign ministers of Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Morocco, Saudi
Arabia, Senegal, Egypt and Malaysia, which form the Organisation of the
Islamic Conference ''contact group'' on Bosnia, declared at the Geneva
meeting that the UN arms embargo on Bosnia was ''invalid.''
Velayati did not name the countries or say what type of assistance was
expected to reach the Bosnian Muslims.
''Islamic countries object to the West's stance on Bosnia and consider
it to be unfair,'' the Iranian minister added in his remarks on Iran
radio.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohammed Sacirbey, who attended the Geneva
meeting, said he had been given pledges of weaponry and that military
chiefs and defence ministers from the 51-member OIC would be meeting to
work out details of help to his country.
The Iranian parliament speaker said on Iran television: ''The
behaviour of the United Nations and the Security Council shows that they
themselves want the Muslims to be driven out of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and
that they approve of the crimes committed by the Serbs through their
silence.''
The London conference threatened retaliation against Bosnian Serbs if
they attacked the Gorazde enclave.
Nateq-Nuri said: ''What this means is that they have given their
approval to the slaughter of the Muslims of the cities of Srebrenica and
Zepa and approval of Serb crimes throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina.''
A newspaper in Kula Lumpur yesterday claimed that Malaysia was willing
to sell weapons to Bosnian Muslims. The newspaper also quoted Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad as saying that Malaysia would also supply more
weapons to its force of more than 1500 UN peacekeepers in Bosnia.

In the wake of secret talks between Government ministers and Sinn
Fein, Russell Edmunds assesses the situation as a new uneasiness sweeps
Northern Ireland
CAN peace survive in Northern Ireland? That was the question at the
heart of the secret talks which took place last week between British
ministers and Sinn Fein leaders.
It seems as if events are conspiring against the so-called ''peace
process'' and that the deadlock, which now exists between the IRA and
Sinn Fein on one side and the Government on the other, will not be
easily broken. Worse still, the prospect of a return to terrorism looms
larger in the public mind than at any time since the IRA ceasefire was
announced on August 31, 1994.
An uneasiness has replaced the wave of optimism which accompanied the
ceasefire and was further enhanced by the decision of loyalist
paramilitaries to follow suit last October. Now, Unionists and
Nationalists, Protestants and Catholics alike in Ulster agree that the
potential for renewed trouble has returned, and some even fear it is
only a matter of time before the ceasefire is broken.
It was against this background that Ulster Secretary of State Sir
Patrick Mayhew came face to face with the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
in Londonderry last Tuesday. The meeting had been requested by Adams and
his partner, Martin McGuinness, and Mayhew certainly took a calculated
political risk given that the Unionists, as well as right-wing
Conservatives, remain wary of any Government climb-down in the face of
Sinn Fein demands.
But Mayhew would have been conscious of criticism from Dublin, and
from within Ulster's Catholic community, that the Government has been
acting tardily and allowing the peace process to drift on to dangerous
ground. Confirming that the private meeting had taken place, the
Northern Ireland Office says it was ''held to explore the way forward in
the peace process in the light of recent events.
''It was agreed that in the interests of full and frank exchanges the
meeting would not be publicised. The Government saw this meeting as a
constructive way of restating its position, exploring the position of
Sinn Fein, and seeking to advance the process.''
So what has gone wrong or can be done to rescue a political and
security situation which has undoubtedly worsened in July? When the IRA
announced its ceasefire, it issued only the briefest of statements and
studiously avoided any promises on the longevity of peace. Demands that
the ceasefire should be declared ''permanent'' were shrugged off by Sinn
Fein and eventually the Government agreed to make ''a working
assumption'' that violence was over for good and to engage the IRA's
political wing in ''exploratory'' talks.
Eventually another minor crisis was defused when the Government
resisted and then accepted Sinn Fein's demand for direct talks with
ministers. Scottish-born Michael Ancram was involved in private talks
with a delegation led by Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness. Meanwhile, Gerry
Adams has enjoyed celebrity status since the ceasefire, especially in
the United States and was feted in New York and Washington where he was
greeted by President Clinton in the White House.
Once again, the handshaking annoyed Unionists who believe the policy
of the Government is unduly appeasing, but again a crisis had been
averted and the peace process received another boost with a high-profile
investment conference hosted by Mr Clinton in Washington in May, and
attended by delegates of all parties from Ulster, including Sinn Fein,
Sir Patrick Mayhew, and the Unionists.
But even as the delegates returned to Belfast, the storm clouds were
gathering again over a number of very difficult issues. Sinn Fein has
intensified its demands for ''all-inclusive talks'' with all the other
parties to the Ulster problem while the Government insists that the IRA
must hand over some weaponry before this could be considered.
Another stumbling block is the release of terrorist prisoners. Again
the Government is resisting calls for early releases but into this pot
of disagreement came a new ingredient -- the extraordinary case of
Private Lee Clegg, a paratrooper jailed for life for the murder of a
Catholic joyrider and his teenage girlfriend in West Belfast. Clegg's
release this month is being compared in nationalist eyes with the
treatment of IRA convicts and even moderate Irish voices have been
raised against the Government's decision. The case of the paratrooper
has done nothing to build trust and confidence between London and
Ulster's nationalist community at a crucial milestone in the peace
process.
Given all the warning signals, the street violence which erupted
across Catholic districts of Belfast and other centres in Northern
Ireland when Clegg was released this month was totally predictable.
Between street rioting, hijackings and petrol bombs, the old tensions
surfaced again and, to make matters worse, just as Protestant Orangemen
were preparing for their annual July 12 marches.
These, too, promised confrontation as the Orange Order set out to
resist re-routing of its parades at two sectarian flashpoints -- the
Ormeau Road in Belfast and Garvaghy Road, Portadown. The result has been
one of the most tense and troublesome July periods for years, even if
there were no outright terrorist incidents in the shape of guns or
bombs.
A new wave of sectarian violence with attacks on Orange halls and
Catholic churches has swept Ulster. The old sickeness of sectarian
attacks on people and homes has returned to haunt mixed neighbourhoods.
The RUC which has been anticipating a major reduction in its strength as
a result of the ceasefires, has found itself so stretched that troops
were again on stand-by at the height of the recent street disturbances.
According to Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness last week, the peace
process is ''in dire crisis''. Even though he had been attending the
secret meeting with British ministers, he still issued a threat of an
escalation of street protests. Whether this was evidence that last
Tuesday's talks made little or no progress is unclear. However,
observers in Belfast find it odd that Sinn Fein should be raising the
temperature on the streets, while privately talking with the Government.
''We are telling the British Government that we intend to put tens of
thousands of people on the streets of this island as part of our demand
for peace negotiations to resolve the issues at the heart of the
conflict,'' said McGuinness angrily last week. ''It is still not too
late, but the peace process is in dire crisis at the moment.''
The spectre of protests has alarmed the Irish Government which is
calling on Sinn Fein to think again. In the current tense climate, the
fear in Dublin is that street demonstrations could lead to confrontation
and violence which would not aid but destroy Ulster's hard-won peace.
Behind the scenes British and Irish officials are struggling to find a
formula for compromise. The refusal of the IRA to countenance any
hand-over of weapons, the reluctance of the Government to release
terrorist prisoners, the opposition of unionists to any talks involving
Sinn Fein, seem insurmountable problems, but somehow the officials hope
that a package of measures might be agreed which will allow the peace
process to continue.
How the logjam can be broken is difficult to see but it is expected
that Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart, John Bruton,
will meet later this month. Both are mindful that the first anniversary
of the IRA ceasefire approaches at the end of August. It has been a
historic and remarkable year for Northern Ireland but what the future
holds is uncertain. A breakthrough in the current deadlock is urgently
needed and the talks between ministers and Sinn Fein last week only
serve to underline this point.

SERB forces and an allied Muslim militia intensified attacks yesterday
on the Bosnian Government enclave of Bihac, seizing more ground and
forcing about 1000 people to flee, UN observers said.
Rebel Croatian Serbs and Muslim militiamen under separatist warlord
Fikret Abdic attacked from the border of Serb-held Croatia to the north
and west and have flung back Government Fifth Corps troops up to five
miles.
More than 30 square miles of territory appeared to have been gobbled
up by Krajina Serb tank, artillery, and infantry units backed by Abdic's
forces since Wednesday, UN observers said.
The gains included around 20% of the Muslim enclave's farmland at
harvest time, dealing another blow to Bihac's 180,000 people who are
already facing widespread malnutrition after more than a year of Serb
blockades on UN aid convoys.
''We're looking at some quite difficult times for the people of the
enclave in purely humanitarian terms,'' said Colonel Jesper Helsoe,
Danish commander of the 1350-man Bangladeshi peacekeeping battalion in
Bihac in north-west Bosnia.
Helsoe said around 1000 people had fled the assault, raising refugee
numbers to more than 2000 in five days of fighting.
''We can see the refugees passing by the compound, towards the centre
of the pocket where it is safer.''
He said heavy fighting erupted this morning on northern and western
confrontation lines of Bihac. Bosnian Serbs joined in later from the
south where there were heavy exchanges of artillery and small arms fire.
''Fighting is going on some 2.5 miles from our base at Coralici,''
Helsoe said. ''It seems to be a co-ordinated action of all three parties
involved. The Bihac area is now being attacked from all directions.''
The Bosnian Serbs captured the eastern ''safe area'' of Srebrenica on
July 11, and threaten the nearby enclave of Zepa. Military analysts say
they may well turn on Bihac town soon, convinced the West will not
follow through on bombing threats made after Friday's London conference.
In Zepa, a radio operator reported heavy Serb tank and infantry
attacks against the town yesterday.
There was no independent confirmation of the details of the report
although UN officials in Sarajevo did substantiate reports of fighting
in the area.
''We're being hit by a very strong tank and infantry attack this
morning,'' said amateur radio operator Fadil Heljic speaking from Zepa.
''The Serbs are coming from the direction of Han Pijesak and
Rogatica.''
The UN-designated ''safe area'' has been on the verge of falling since
Wednesday when Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic prematurely announed
its surrender.
Sporadic fighting has continued since then with little specific
information emanating from the pocket other than that picked up from
amateur radio sources and sketchy reports from the 79 Ukrainian
peacekeepers posted in the town.
About 17,000 Muslims are believed to be trapped in Zepa, which is one
of six UN-designated ''safe areas'' in Bosnia.
* Dutch United Nations peacekeepers saw Bosnian Serbs shoot nine men
dead in the former Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, a Dutch general said.
Army commander Hans Couzy told Dutch television from Zagreb that so far
this was the only atrocity that he knew had been directly witnessed by
Dutch soldiers.

BUSTLE, bustle. Knock, knock. Leaflet, leaflet. John Hudson is, shall
we say, a hard act to follow.
''Well, this really isn't our territory, but you have to make the
effort don't you?'' he said. Well, I suppose so, but . . . oh, he's off
again.
''The Opposition can only attack Government policies or offer waffle
dressed up as policy. The so-called new Labour Party advocates damaging
policies such as the mimimum wage which would cost jobs in this
constituency. The Liberal Democrats' fondness for a federal Europe
demonstrates that they would not stand up for British business.
''Anyway, we're just going to do the main road and then we're off
somewhere else. Nice meeting you.'' Thanks.
Crossing from grey, dismal Shaw, made even more miserable by
unrelenting early-morning rain, to the picturesque village of Delph and
one might as well be in the Scottish Borders.
Old, forgotten, and neglected factories, ramshackle terraced houses
and struggling small businesses quickly give way to rolling hills and
open farmland as you climb -- a first-gear job for my seriously ill taxi
-- high into the Lancashire countryside before dropping down again into
communities which used to thrive on the textile industry but now serve
largely as ''feeder'' commuter areas for Oldham, Rochdale, and
Manchester.
Spinning a yarn here these days are the candidates in the
three-cornered fight for the Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election,
caused by the death of Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens. And a right old battle
they are having in the last few days before polling on Thursday.
The bustling Hudson, a polite, dapper man of 55 is, if you hadn't
guessed it, the Tory candidate in a scrap which has been portrayed by
some observers as being between him and the Liberal, Chris Davies. But
it would be foolish to rule out Labour's Phil Woolas who is coming up
hard on the rails in the final week of the campaign.
Hudson may feel, as it were, that he already has one hand on the cup.
He is defending a slender majority of 4494, but he was born and brought
up in the area, is well known, and was Geoffrey Dickens's agent in the
constituency for the five years up to his death.
The Tories are being a bit snooty about the whole thing, setting up
camp in the town of Littleborough, miles from enemy headquarters and,
while there seems to be a bedrock of support, particularly in the north
of the constituency there are signs of slippage either to the Liberal
Democrats or Labour.
Solid supporters include the likes of part-time secretary Maureen
Harris, who said: ''I think John Hudson is an excellent candidate. He is
a local man who knows the area. I also like Tory policies on a range of
issues and Labour worries me. Granted on schools and the health service
there are problems, but you can't make this better just by throwing
money at it.''
Nick Garside, who will be a first-time voter next week, praised
Geoffrey Dickens for fighting hard to get a sixth form installed at
Wardle High School ''in the teeth'', as he put it, of opposition from
local Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors, and made clear he would
vote for Hudson.
''The recent leadership contest has reaffirmed my Conservative beliefs
and I think we now have strong leadership.''
But among those switching camps is shift foreman Victor Edwards, who
voted for Dickens at the last General Election. He said: ''Geoffrey was
a good constituency MP who would do his best for you, whatever your
allegiances. That's the kind of MP we want and Phil Woolas fits the
bill.''
Self-employed mother-of-two Kath Tod, who has voted Tory and Lib-Dem
before, said: ''I'm sick to death of the hidden taxes under the Tories.
We pay enough in income tax without VAT on heating and things like
insurance tax, and the price of prescriptions is astronomical.
''I'm going to vote Labour this time because it is new Labour, and I
really admire John Prescott because he calls a spade a spade. Prescott
and Blair make a good team.''
Retired electrical engineer Harry Jackson said: ''I'll be voting
Labour. After 16 years in office the Tories are tired and complacent.
They think they can bring in tax cuts at the last minute and we'll vote
for them. Tony Blair is a breath of fresh air, and he's leading a
different sort of Labour Party now.''
Davies, in the Liberal Democrat camp, is trying to ''out-local''
Hudson, playing on the fact that he has lived in the constituency since
1986 and is a local councillor, representing Lees ward on Oldham
Metropolitan Borough Council.
The Lib-Dems are trying to concentrate hard on local issues --
housing, education, crime -- with crime being of particular importance
since a party researcher, up from London to help, had all the wheels of
his much-treasured sports car . . . um, quietly removed by local
motoring enthusiasts.
Davies is a rather nervous, quick-spoken chap, who is a keen fell
runner -- a hobby he may find difficult to pursue at Westminster, though
he can always practice on the stairs -- and he seems to be attracting a
fair bit of support.
One local voter, Elizabeth Franklin, from Shaw, said: ''Round here
it's the Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives. Labour always say they
can win, then always finish third. I want to make sure the Conservatives
are beaten this time.''
David Ritchie, whose business manufactures medical supplies,
criticised the Government's failure to back British business. ''Small
businesses like mine have been let down by the Conservatives,'' he said.
''We need investment, not short-term tax-cut election bribes.''
And Delph resident Frances Jackson said: ''Mr Davies works hard for
local people and will make an excellent parliamentarian.''
Labour is giving it a big push in the build-up to polling day, even
going so far the other day as to publish a 16-page document rubbishing
the Liberal Democrats over taxation policy, complete with a cartoon of
the Lib-Dem candidate done up as a burglar with a bag of swag over his
shoulder.
They set off on the hand-shaking, baby-kissing electoral trail with
leaflets containing the aforementioned cartoon and a whole bunch of
orange balloons bearing an anti-Liberal Democrat slogan. Such are
by-elections.
The Labour candidate, Woolas, is 35 and looks -- picture this if you
dare -- a bit like David Mellor with Michael Portillo's hairstyle.
He is head of communications for the GMB union, but at a recent
campaign press conference he communicated hardly anything at all,
swivelling his head like someone watching Wimbledon as big guns Peter
Mandelson and Andrew Smith fielded the media flak.
Still, his message is clear enough. The Tony Blair-led Labour Party is
a whole new ball game, and if the people of Littleborough and
Saddleworth want to have real influence at Westminster they could do
worse than vote for him, even though he is currently an outsider.
So there we are. Whether you take the high road over the hills or the
low road -- the main drag into Oldham -- the poster war will leave you
in no doubt that a by-election is well and truly on.
The Lib-Dems are still probably favourites to take it, but the Tories
are in with their best chance for ages of holding on, and no-one should
write off the Labour challenge. You pays your money and you takes your
choice.

A MAJOR talking point until Thursday morning in the City will be to
what extent the directors of Imperial Chemical Industries will provide
against the #250m of damages awarded against it by a Texas jury last
week.
The company has said that it will fight for a judicial review of the
verdict.
The case arose because Atlas Powder Company, which ICI bought in 1990,
is alleged to have conspired with others, at around the time of the ICI
takeover, to lower prices in a concerted attack on the plaintiff,
Thermex Energy, which went bankrupt five years ago.
The company is enjoying continuing strong trading in resurgent
chemicals markets and this should be reflected in second-quarter
profits, expected to have risen from #141m to between #260m and #300m
before allowing for any Thermex provisions.
Analysts are looking for an increase in the interim payout from 10.5p
to around though 11p though some consider it may be unchanged while the
optimists go as high as 11.5p.
Tomorrow sees Perth-based Stagecoach, Britain's largest bus company,
announcing its full-year results to the end of April.
The acquisitive group is expected to have driven earnings ahead
strongly and pre-tax profits are thought likely to have risen to around
#31m compared with #18.9m, itelf a 46% increase, last time. As for the
dividend, this could climb to 4.8p compared with the previous year's
total of 4.1p.
Also checking in tomorrow is healthcare group SmithKline Beecham with
its second quarter figures. Analysts' expectations vary within a range
of #287m to #305m.
That compares with #291m in the same period last year, so the more
pessimistic are looking for a slight dip despite the expected strong
growth in new drugs. The interim dividend, though, is still projected at
3.2p, up from 3p previously.
On Wednesday, British Telecom produces first-quarter profits. The
range of projections by analysts is quite wide, from #810m to #860m
before tax excluding exceptional items, a useful improvement on the
#781m chalked up for the same period of 1994. Redundancy costs are
thought likely to amount to about #40m.
Wednesday also includes the interim results from tobacco and insurance
giant BAT Industries, Reuters, and Lloyds Abbey Life, whose parent
Lloyds Bank kicks off the interim banking season on Friday.
For BAT, cigarette volumes are expected to show big increases but
tobacco profitability outside the US and Brazil may be disappointing.
Profits are likely to break the #1000m barrier, rising to about #1085m
though there are estimates nearer the #1036m mark. The interim dividend
could be lifted from 8.5p to 9.15p.
Expected profits of Reuters are in a narrow #283m to #287m range
against #245m previously with the half-year dividend possibly lifted
from 1.9p to 2.25p.

The M77 protesters may have fallen silent but they have not
disappeared. Alison Daniels finds the campaign set to head in a new
direction.
FROM close up the M77 extension linking the heart of Glasgow with the
main Ayr road looks a bit like a scar, raised up on steep embankments of
earth. Diggers bite at top soil, levelling the earth. Nearly-completed
bridge supports stand either side of the White Cart Water meandering
through the Pollok Estate. By Haggs Castle, to the north, work is under
way on a junction connecting the extension to the existing M77 segment.
To the south, at one end of the Barrhead Road, youthful security guards
loiter by the steel fence that separates the motorway site from the road
protesters' camp, the Pollok Free State.
It is almost five months since hundreds of police and security guards
launched a dawn raid on the protesters living among the trees that
fringe Pollok Park. By the end of a tense March day 350 trees had been
felled, minor scuffles subdued, and a handful of protesters, including
Pollok's Militant councillor Tommy Sheridan, were arrested. The
residents of the nearby housing estates of Corkerhill and Pollok, who
had come to lend their support, drifted home.
With the trees down and the confrontation over the media moved on,
leaving images of a doomed roads protest which failed to enlist the
support of the well-organised middle-class car-driving lobby, so
instrumental in halting the Newby by-pass in England and, crucially,
those commuting from Ayr to Glasgow.
Work on the extension continues to schedule and contractor Wimpey says
it is confident of meeting thecompletion deadline of late next year.
But if the rather disparate groups of anti-motorway protesters have
fallen silent, they have not disappeared. The tree people of the Pollok
Free State are staying put. Across the #53m motorway, designed to ease
traffic flowing through the South Side of Glasgow, cut accidents, and
improve the economic prospects of Ayrshire, the residents of the
Corkerhill estate are turning their attention to the courts in a bid to
claim compensation for noise and health problems associated with the
motorway.
Beside the Barrhead road a new rash of signs splashed with stark
messages proclaim to motorists they are driving past ''Asthma
Junction''.
Over the past few months the tree camp has evolved into more of a
symbolic presence than the nerve centre of eco-warriors preparing to
take any direct action. Now, according to the camp's key activist, Colin
Macleod, there are around 12 residents. He himself has a home in Govan,
where his wife has just had a baby, but he is usually around.
By the protesters' own admission they are not doing much in the way of
protesting save for slipping over the wire fence every now and then to
''have a look at the machinery''.
Like many of the tree people who came in for criticism during the
high-profile confrontation with Wimpey, Dave Dragometti is unemployed
and English. He came to the camp six months ago, motivated, he says, by
a feeling of guilt about his lack of involvement in protests over the
M11 near his former home in North London. The 27-year-old left his
possessions with his mother and headed north to live in a tent.
Now he's thinking of moving on once he has finished building the 10ft
wire man spread-eagled under a tree. He says he might go to southern
Poland to a commune he's heard about called Ecotopia. He thinks he has
got on well with local residents but concedes there has occasionally
been a bit of friction.
Dave Featherstone, a 20-year-old Cambridge University student, has
been in Pollok for three weeks. Gesturing wildly he talks earnestly
about direct action. Glaswegians John and Willie are less effervescent
and reluctant to give surnames. Their talk is about a moral victory.
They have, they say, been successful in instilling a concern for the
environment among those living close to the motorway path.
Certainly Betty Campbell, a Corkerhill resident for 22 years, can see
the motorway. It runs past her back garden and she says she cannot
escape the noise of the diggers drifting over the sound barriers which
should screen out the noise of the traffic when the road is opened.
Most days she and the flamboyant figure of 72-year-old community
councillor Walter Morrison sit outside the estate's community centre
sandwiched in the middle of a row of steel-shuttered shops beside a
wooden display board smothered in posters and slogans. Inside the centre
hang anti-motorway banners. For those who drop in Mr Morrison is keen,
with the aid of overhead slides, to rattle through his version of the
history of the motorway.
Conceding that the Corkerhill residents have little chance of stopping
a motorway approved by a public inquiry seven years ago, he says the
fight now centres on claiming compensation.
Around 500 people on an estate with 580 residents have signed a
petition supporting such action. Last week Mr Morrison organised a
meeting attended by around 100 people at which a number of residents
agreed to pursue individual claims with the help of a lawyer, Liz
Loughlan, hired by the campaign organisation, Glasgow For People.
''People round here aren't the sort to lie in front of bulldozers,
they are conventional. But the Corkerhill community has been squeezed in
by the motorway and cut off from the park -- it is a form of social
apartheid. In no way has the fire died down in the bellies of those who
don't want this motorway.''
According to the organisation's campaigns officer, Ian Cowan, work on
the site begins at 7am and finishes at 9pm. ''Not one house has had any
noise insulation put in. The sense of betrayal in places like
Corkerhill, Darnley and Arden is growing daily. We are in touch with
lawyers specialising in compensation and individuals are seeking legal
advice on how to claim damages, not only for the losses they are
suffering now but for all the losses they will suffer when the road is
completed.''
Depending on funds there are also plans to appeal to the European
courts over the environmental impact of the motorway. In a separate move
Friends of the Earth Scotland also plans to challenge the road in Europe
on the grounds that a ''proper'' environmental assessment was not
carried out by the council.
But Wimpey says the campaigners on both sides of the ribbon of mud
that will in time transport 53,000 cars every day have not caused any
problems. The company would only comment: ''Security levels have been
maintained at a reasonable level for this type of project and there have
been no recent acts of vandalism at the construction area.''
A new rash of signs proclaim to motorists they are driving past
'Asthma Junction'
IT IS A FORM
OF SOCIAL
APARTHEID
According to Wimpey, the protesters have not caused any problems and
work on the M77 extension continues on schedule for completion late next
year. Above, looking south, is the section bisecting the Darnley Road.
To the north, by Haggs Castle, below, work is under way on a junction
connecting the extension to the existing M77 segment. The Corkerhill
community claims it has been squeezed in by the motorway and cut off
from the park and a number of residents are reported to be pursuing
individual claims with the help of a lawyer, Liz Loughlan, hired by the
campaign organisation, Glasgow For People. Pictures: PHIL RIDER

<HEADLINE>Euro-MP to raise landfill site case</HEADLINE>

THE Euro-MP for Lothian, Mr David Martin, is to take the case of a
proposed landfill site at Levenseat Quarry in West Lothian to the
European Commission in a bid to have the development stopped.
Mr Martin intends to ask whether the EU Directive covering landfill
operations should have been applied in this case, and an environmental
impact assessment carried out.
If so, the planning permission granted to Levenseat Landfill might be
invalid. West Lothian District Council, in consultation with the
Fauldhouse Against Tipping at Levenseat action group, also plans to ask
a lawyer specialising in environmental law to look at the case.
Mr Martin said: ''So far, Fauldhouse has had six dumps in the area,
three of which are still active. People here have taken the view that
this is one too many.''
He added that there were also fears that the site would be used for
toxic and hazardous waste, given the investment the developers were
making to extend a railway line to the quarry and to secure the site
from leakage.
Mrs Eileen Woods, co-ordinator of the local action group, said: ''This
is not the Nimby thing. We have already got three active ones, and we
just don't want any more.''
Mr Peter MacLaren, a director of Levenseat Landfill, said: ''We are
not in the business of taking 'nasties'. The waste is categorised very
carefully, and the ones that are categorised as potentially hazardous
are all subject to very strict controls. We are certainly not offering
to take any of those.''
Mr MacLaren said that if Mr Martin was planning to take the case to
the European Commission he should ''at least get in touch with us and be
informed of what the facts are before he actually does''.

<HEADLINE>US warns of 'heavy' air strikes</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977240258</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday he believed US air power should
be used in Bosnia if Serbian aggression continues, especially against
the ''safe haven'' of Gorazde.
However, he confirmed that US ground troops would not be sent into
combat.
He was speaking as Nato officials said they would meet again in
Brussels today to consider the technicalities for intervention in
Bosnia. The discussions have been almost continuous since Friday's
summit in London which threatened ''decisive'' action against the
Bosnian Serbs if they moved against Goradze.
Secrecy surrounded the Brussels discussions but in Washington at the
weekend the US Defence Secretary, William Perry, said ''heavy'' air
strikes were in prospect. There was speculation in London that a
personal warning of retribution for Serb aggression would be given to
the Bosnian Serb commander, Ratko Mladic.
In Washington yesterday, Clinton said: ''I do believe we should use
American air power if the Serbian aggression continues to erode the
commitments that they have all made, for example, to respect the
integrity of Gorazde.''
He added: ''We are not going to get involved on the ground in the
combat there.''
He said the US commitment to sending troops was limited to two
scenarios: if they are needed to help extract an embattled United
Nations peacekeeping force or to help enforce a peace settlement.
French President Jacques Chirac said yesterday France would stand firm
against Serb military pressure in Bosnia, adding that French forces
would hit Serb targets if attacked around the Bosnian capital.
Chirac, speaking after Serb forces killed two French peacekeepers in
an overnight attack near Sarajevo, said: ''The Serbs had better
understand that we won't give in. I want to say right away that the
instructions given are to reinforce our positions around Sarajevo with
the (UN) Rapid Reaction Force and shoot back systematically, as we did
last night against a Serb barracks, at Serb targets if we are attacked
again.''
As if to reinforce his words, an armoured column of some 500 French
Foreign Legionnaires left their base at Tomislavgrad in western Bosnia
to reinforce UN peacekeepers in Sarajevo.
Defence Minister Charles Millon said in Paris that the column was
headed towards Mount Igman overlooking Sarajevo to make sure the track
leading past it to the city remained open for humanitarian supplies.
Millon said the city's airport, closed for months by the Serbs,
''would have to be reopened'' and he revealed France had sent an
unspecified number of heavy 155mm cannons by sea.
Meanwhile, the Pope urged those suffering in former Yugoslavia not to
despair of finding peace.
''We must turn our preoccupied gaze once again on the martyred people
of Bosnia,'' the pontiff told pilgrims after his noon Angelus address at
his summer residence near Rome.
''How can we not hear their heart-rending cries for help? To those
directly hit by such an inhuman tragedy I say again: Do not lose hope.
We are close to you in solidarity and in prayer, which is the great
means at our disposal.''
* Two women have taken just days to set up an international appeal to
try to bring relief to the suffering of women and children in the former
Yugoslavia. After watching TV pictures of people fleeing Srebrenica,
Rosemary Pockley and Angela Guillaume of Lyminton, Hampshire, were
determined to do something.
Donations to International Appeal for Women and Families in former
Yugoslavia can be sent to the British Red Cross or made at any Barclays
Bank branch.

SMALL and medium-sized businesses expect the economy to strengthen
over the next year, a survey showed today.
The survey, by the Association of British Factors &amp; Discounters, found
that more than two thirds (72%) expect business to improve and only 3%
expect it to get worse.
Around 20% expect it to remain the same.
Ben Allen, chairman of the ABFD, said: ''Small and medium-sized
businesses are looking forward to economic prosperity after lean times
during the early 1990s.
''The high expectations for employment, profits and turnover are all
based on improvements over the past year and a sensible, investment
based approach to our future.''

MOST people in Scotland think the Royal Mail is providing a good
service, according to the annual report of the Post Office Users'
Council for Scotland.
The report, published today, says that in a recent survey of public
opinion 88% of respondents said they felt they received good service,
with 77% agreeing that they received good value for money and 61%
supporting the statement that the service cared about what its customers
thought.
The report adds that the volume of letters posted across the UK had
risen by almost 50% in the last 10 years, with, on average, more than
9.25 million items of mail handled every day in Scotland.
Overall, first class deliveries are said to have shown an improvement
compared with results in previous years.
However, ''unfortunately and perhaps rather surprisingly'', the
overall success is slightly offset by some failures which have occurred
in the quality of service for first class mail posted and delivered
within the same post code area, the report says.
''Many of these failures have been marginal, but we would hope to see
an improvement in this area in due course,'' it says.

<HEADLINE>Commerzbank still on the prowl for foreign broker</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>14</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977240262</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Frankfurt, Sunday -- Commerzbank, which on Friday lost out to US-based
Merrill Lynch in a bid for British brokerage house Smith New Court, was
reported still to be in the market for a specialised foreign partner.
In an interview in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper,
Commerzbank chairman Martin Kohlhaussen said his bank wanted to expand
its activities in New York, London, and Singapore.
''If a favourable opportunity presents itself, and which also fits in
well with our bank, then an acquisition is conceivable,'' Mr Kohlhaussen
said, adding however that the bank did not have any plans at present to
take over a US brokerage house.
Earlier this year, Commerzbank bought a 60% stake in Martingale Asset
Management LP of Boston and took a hard look at the commodity futures
brokerage unit of US-based Rodman and Renshaw but decided against making
an offer.
Industry analysts believe Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest
commercial bank, is seeking a small, high-quality Anglo-American
investment broker to catch up with its rivals.
This year saw Dresdner Bank take over the British-based Kleinwort
Benson and Deutsche Bank has moved to concentrate its international
investment banking activities in London.
Commerzbank has sold off large stakes and built up its stock capital
in apparent preparation for a similar move while revamping its somewhat
staid, parochial image, analysts said.
Mr Kohlhaussen said Commerzbank was interested more in medium-sized
specialised companies rather than in broad-based investment banks. He
said Smith New Court would have complemented Commerzbank well, with few
overlaps.
He said his bank ended talks with Smith New Court's management because
the latter could not come to a decision on a possible partner and
''could not make its mind up about its own strategy''.
Commerzbank's bid for Smith New Court followed the purchase earlier
this year of 75% of the British fund management group Jupiter Tyndall.

IF the people of Tayside were willing to pay an extra #14 a year, or

Western Isles, Orkney, Shetland, Highland, and Grampian could benefit,
some by up to #100 a year.
According to Mr Angus Graham, vice convener of the Western Isles
Islands Council, all that needs to be done is to persuade Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth to agree to ''pool'' the total water charges
for the new Northern Area Water Authority then divide by the number of
households paying them.
Mr Graham believes it is vital that the principle is accepted now
before the new water authorities are set up next spring. Most expect
rises in water charges thereafter. ''Now that the members of the new
water authorities have been named, we will be pushing for them to
embrace this proposal,'' he said.
He has written to Mr Forsyth asking him to consider the idea. Mr
Graham said: ''The Western Isles Council, Orkney and Shetland Islands
Councils, and Highland Regional Council have had to incur massive debt
on our water and sewage budgets simply to afford our people the most
basic of conditions that are enjoyed in any other part of the UK.
''But our ability to service that debt has always been undermined by
having small populations who consequently have to bear a
disproportionate local tax just to try and get near to what everybody in
the central belt takes for granted. These are the hard facts of life in
the Scottish islands and the Highlands.
''It must be remembered that the Government in its wisdom has decided
that ability to pay water charges will not be recognised in benefit
payments, so the very poorest have been hit very hard by their water
charges.''
According to Mr Graham's figures, 8110 households (taken as Band D
equivalents) in the Western Isles are having to pay #186 each in order
that #1.5m can be raised -- the water costs to the council.
In Orkney, 6130 households pay #122 to raise #748,000; Shetland, 7037
pay #118.36 to raise #833,000; Highland, 75,300 pay #91.10 to raise
#6.86m; Grampian, 188,994 pay #89 to raise #16.82m; and Tayside, 136,500
pay #74 to raise #10.101m.
If all these charges were pooled and divided by the 422,071 households
in the new Northern Water Area an average charge of #88 would result on
existing figures.
Mr Graham said: ''This seems to be the simplest and fairest solution
to the whole question. I hope the Secretary of State, who has already
indicated his willingess to listen, will agree to discuss this proposal
with the councils in the Northern Water Area. ''
Mr Duncan McPherson, convener of Highland Regional Council, said last
night that Mr Graham's proposal had to be taken seriously.
''Any measure which might mean that basic services can be delivered at
less cost to those living in the remoter areas of the country surely
should be examined carefully,'' he said.
Mr John Culliven, chairman of Tayside's water and sewage committee,
was not so enthusiastic, however. ''In Tayside, we have managed to
achieve a level of good house-keeping which has kept the water charges
to a broadly acceptable level. I certainly do not think it would be fair
that we should be penalised for having been so thrifty.''

A STUDY published today shows that children who do badly at school are
far more likely to become teenage parents.
The report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation also indicates that young
fathers and mothers are likely to have come from poor backgrounds and
suffered financial hardship.
The survey, which draws on data from more than 17,000 children born in
1958, including 1800 born in Scotland, highlights the instability of
relationships formed by young people and the increased risks that their
children will be raised in poverty.
Researchers found:
* More than four in every 10 teenage mothers who were married when
their babies were born had since separated from the father. Three in 10
were living with a new partner.
* Six in 10 women who had been cohabiting when they first gave birth
were no longer living with the father.
* Half the teenage mothers who were single when they gave birth
subsequently married or cohabitied with the father. However, only a
third were continuing to do so.
* In later years, young parents were more likely to be living on state
benefit or be in low paid work than others. They were also less likely
to buy a home and more likely to have been homeless.
* Young fathers were twice as likely to be unemployed as other men
their age.
The research also shows that, compared with girls who became mothers
at a later age, almost three times as many teenage mothers left school
without qualifications.
The author of the report, Kathleen Kiernan, a senior research fellow
at the London School of Economics, said the findings were uniform across
Scotland, England, and Wales.
She said: ''The link between improved educational performance and a
reduced likelihood of young parenthood suggests that educational
investment may be a critical component in the prevention of early
parenthood and its attendant disadvantages.''
She said her study had found that, unlike other European countries,
teenage fertility rates in Britain had not declined noticeably in the
past 15 years.
The rates in Britain were twice those of West Germany, four times
those of Italy, and 10 times those of Switzerland, she said.
The report also notes the number of teenage births outside marriage
has risen over the past 15 years, from fewer than half to almost eight
in 10.
Dr Kiernan said there was good reason to believe that early parenthood
had intensified as a problem and threatened to create its own
underclass.

THE gloom hanging over the housing market is set to intensify this
week with figures showing an increase in the number of homes being
repossessed by mortgage lenders -- the first such rise since 1991.
Although yet to be finalised, figures to be released on Wednesday from
the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents Britain's banks and
building societies, are expected to show a small rise in repossessions
in the first half of this year.
Last year lenders repossessed 49,210 homes against 75,540 in 1991. But
lenders have been warning of a rise in repossessions ever since the
Government announced plans, due to be introduced in October, to cut back
on income support for new homeowners who lose their jobs.
The fact that the expected upturn may already have started suggests
lenders are adopting a more hard-nosed approach to the problem of
mortgage arrears.
Repossessions had been falling since the recession partly because of a
more tolerant attitude on the part of lenders.
However, there has been a hard core of borrowers in arrears whose
debts have been piling up. And it seems that lenders may  be reaching
the point where they feel unable or unwilling to tolerate the situation
any longer.
The revelation of a rise in repossessions will come as a further blow
to homeowners already suffering from falling house prices and living in
fear of further interest rate rises.
Although most economists believe rates are on hold for the time being,
a majority continues to believes there will be a further increase in the
cost of borrowing towards the end of the year.
Rising repossessions will also increase the political pressure on the
Government to come up with a rescue package to kick-start the moribund
housing market.

<HEADLINE>Supporters in walk-out during morning service. Church split as minister 'ousted'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977240267</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WOMAN minister, whose congregation has become bitterly divided, is
leaving her charge a year before her appointment is due to end.
Supporters of the Rev Ella Pennington, of St Mary's United Free
Church, in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, claim she has been driven out and
predict that about half the 64-strong congregation will leave.
There was an angry scene last Sunday when the minister announced at
the end of the morning service that she would be going in September.
As Mr David Richardson, an elder and former session clerk, stood up
and read a prepared statement wishing her well, someone shouted out a
disparaging remark.
Mrs Pennington then walked out without giving the final benediction
and was followed by several members of the congregation.
Two months ago, the 56-year-old minister wrote to her flock about
''the increasingly financial and spiritual state'' of the church.
She said a section of the eight-strong deacon's court were eager to
end her five-year appointment which began in September 1991.
She also revealed that because of the critical financial situation, Mr
Richardson had proposed cancelling her stipend and using incoming money
to pay for for gas, electricity, and insurance.
The situation was investigated by the UF Church presbytery and it was
decided to end Mrs Pennington's appointment in September this year.
After she announced this at the service, Mr Richardson, reading from a
prepared statement, said: ''In September 1991, we had high hopes of a
full-time ministry here in St Mary's. Unfortunately, the venture has not
come off as expected.
''Through lack of attendance at church and lack of financial support
we are no longer able to continue the full-time ministry. We are all
very sad that our step into the unknown has ended but we wish our
minister well for the future.''
Mr Richardson, speaking at his home in Moffat, said: ''With such a
small congergation we simply cannot afford to have a full-time minister.
It is a financial problem.''
But a woman member of the congregation who did not want to be named
said: ''There's more to it than finance. There has been a clash of
personalities and some people were determined to drive out Mrs
Pennington.''
''She has suffered dreadfully. She is a very dedicated minister with a
real vocation. But some members want to run the church as their own club
without a full-time minister.''
She added: ''When Mrs Pennington goes, I'm sure half the congregation
will leave the church.''
Mrs Pennington, who gave up teaching to become a minister -- St Mary's
was her first charge -- said yesterday: ''I don't want to say anything
about what happened at last week's service.''
She said she did not yet have a new appointment.
* Three Catholic priests have won their fight against their bishop's
decision to move them to other parishes.
The Vatican has ruled that Bishop Maurice Taylor, of Galloway Diocese,
violated church law by ordering their transfer.
Fr Ralph Mancini, 65, of St Andrew's, Dumfries; Fr Michael Lynch, also
65, of St Peter-in-Chains, Ardrossan, and Fr Denis Quinlan, 62, of St
Joseph's, Kilmarnock, are all parish priests.
They have been fighting the bishop's order for five years and took the
case to the supreme tribunal of the Roman Catholic Church, the Signatura
in Rome. Meanwhile, they have all remained in their parishes, carrying
on as usual with their pastoral work.
Frs Mancini and Quinlan were not available yesterday and Fr Lynch
said: ''I don't want to make any comment.''
Ayr-based Bishop Taylor said yesterday he had just received the
official notice of the result and added: ''I'm still at the stage of
considering it.''
The bishop decided on the transfer in June 1990, after an assembly of
clergy from the diocese had a wide-ranging discussion about the
deployment of priests, appointments, and the compatibility between
parish priests and curates.
The bishop said at the time his only motive was to serve the church in
Galloway as well as possible.
The three priests have maintained there is a long-standing tradition
in the Galloway dioceses that parish priests should not be transferred
against their will.

A BRIDGE tollhouse used as a bothy is to be taken down brick-by-brick,
then rebuilt 12ft away at an estimated cost of #100,000, to allow a road
to be straightened.
Once the work is completed the building, at a humped-back bridge
across the River Deveron on the road between Turriff and Aberchirder in
Grampian, will be let out as a holiday home for anglers fishing for
trout.
The road will later be re-aligned cutting out a dangerous corner, and
providing parking space for the anglers.
The tollhouse is unique in that it is the only one remaining next to
its bridge in Scotland.
The round, sandstone building built with the bridge in 1826 has been
damaged by high-sided vehicles trying to negotiate a tight bend as they
cross the Deveron.
The building is now owned by Turriff Angling Association, but the
campaign to have it rebuilt has been spearheaded by the North East
Scotland Preservation Trust.
''It is important because it is the only tollhouse that adjoins the
bridge it was originally built with. They are a unique pair,'' said Mr
Robert Chalmers, administrator of the trust.
He explained that one of the conditions of getting a grant from
Historic Scotland was that the tollhouse be returned to its original
condition -- both inside and out.
The plan is to take apart the building, and move it from the roadside
into what is currently the angling association's car park.
The bridge was the link between the former counties of Banffshire and
Aberdeenshire. It replaced a ferry which provided the only crossing of
the river in a 20-mile stretch from Bridge of Marnoch to Banff.
The tollhouse was gifted by Sir George Abercrombie, the then laird of
the neighbouring Forglen Estate, to the angling association about 40
years ago.

<HEADLINE>How Serb forces can stretch thin blue line</HEADLINE>

The UN strategy of sending the Rapid Reaction Forces to Sarajevo could
leave the UN Forces vulnerable. Kurt Schork reports on a mood of
apprehension in the United Nations' ranks.
THE sudden deployment of UN Rapid Reaction Forces to Sarajevo could
quickly reveal how thinly stretched blue helmets are in Bosnia if
trouble develops in other enclaves, UN officials said.
Artillery elements of the RRF were ordered to Sarajevo yesterday in
the aftermath of Serb attacks which killed two French peacekeepers and
wounded three others as well as a Dane.
''The deployment responds to events in Sarajevo but there is fighting
in Zepa and Bihac and the situation could deteriorate around Gorazde or
Tuzla, which would stretch the UN,'' said a United Nations official who
asked not to be named.
''One wonders if the Serbs might not have anticipated the UN
deployment. They could plan to test the reaction force by putting
pressure on a number of 'safe areas' simultaneously.''
The international community warned in London on Friday that further
Serb aggression against UN-designated ''safe areas'' would trigger a
prompt military response.
Serb forces wasted no time testing the world's will and launched
attacks against the ''safe areas'' of Zepa, Bihac, and Sarajevo. Two
other ''safe areas'', Gorazde and Tuzla, remain vulnerable to Serb
attack.
The arrival of 12 British 105mm light guns with a range of 10 miles,
16 Warrior armoured fighting vehicles, and a company of French light
tanks will substantially enhance UN firepower in Sarajevo but will leave
little in reserve.
Some UN officers said the big guns were needed by a vulnerable
contingent in Sarajevo.
''The guns have been sitting around in central Bosnia doing nothing
and now they're coming where they may be able to do something so that's
got to be a step forward,'' said a UN officer.
''The British are coming. Their light guns are what's needed,'' said
another UN official who asked not to be named.
The British 19th Field Regiment of Royal Artillery includes a dozen
105mm field guns with a 10-mile range.
They can fire smoke, high explosive and anti-armour rounds.
The UN moved to deploy units of the RRF to Sarajevo even though only
about 3000 of the planned 10,000-strong reaction force has arrived in
Bosnia. Most of the the 6000-strong 24th Air Mobile brigade, for
instance, are still in Britain.
UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Vernon in Sarajevo said the
decision to bring in more firepower to respond to Bosnian Serb assaults
represented a ''turning point''.
''We consider that it (Serb attack overnight) was direct targeting and
it is that level of unacceptability that made us raise the ante a little
bit,'' said Vernon.
''I think it is certainly a turning point. Does it not demonstrate a
greater degree of intent? It must do. We're bringing something in, it
must do.''
But one diplomat in Sarajevo said the Bosnian Serbs still had the
upper hand in the confrontation with the UN mission.
''Sending the artillery elements of the Rapid Reaction Force to
Sarajevo seems the right thing to do but once again it is a reactive
move,'' said a diplomat in Sarajevo who asked not to be named.
''The Serbs still have the initiative, can still pick and choose where
and when to create a problem. This is still a game of cat and mouse, not
a determined effort by the international community to halt Serb
aggression.'' -- Reuter

A FORMER Government Minister launched a remarkable attack on his own
party's policies and the parliamentary system as he announced yesterday
that he would not fight the next election.
In his resignation letter to his constituency chairman, Mr George
Walden, Tory MP for Buckingham, criticised Britain's ''two-nation''
education system and accused the Government of making a ''fetish'' of
home ownership to create an ''illusion of wealth and stability''.
Mr Walden, 55, a former diplomat, admitted he found himself
''implausible'' as a Tory MP after 12 years in the Commons. He said he
was expected to treat the public ''like infants'' and behave like ''a
child in a school team''.
He revealed that the ''family and personal reasons'' he cited for his
resignation from the post of Higher Education Minister in 1987 included
his dissatisfaction with the role he was expected to play.
* The long-serving Hampshire North West Tory MP, Sir David Mitchell,
yesterday also announced his retirement from the Commons at the next
election.

THE Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, is facing fresh pressure this week
in the row over employee share options.
Lord Lawson, who when Chancellor changed the system on them in his
1984 Budget, warned that Mr Clarke's plans to tax share option profits
would prove ''very damaging for British industry''.
Tory back benchers and business leaders are also lining up to try to
force a change of heart.
At the end of last week Mr Clarke appeared unrepentant over his move,
which followed publication of the Greenbury report into boardroom pay.
However, he has now called Marks and Spencer chairman Sir Richard
Greenbury and his team in for talks at the Treasury tomorrow to try to
clear the air.
If Mr Clarke decides to stick to his guns, he knows he is liable to be
defeated by his own troops in what would be an embarrrassing vote as the
Finance Bill progresses through the House.
Lord Lawson, Chancellor in Lady Thatcher's Cabinet from 1983 to 1989,
said he had been ''very astonished'' by what he considered to be an ill
thought-out policy U-turn rather than an initiative to close some
curious tax loophole.
On the wave of boardroom perks which led to the creation of the
Greenbury Committee, Lord Lawson told Sky TV: ''I think there were
people, in the electricity industry, for example, who were greedy and
went far over the top.''
He added: ''I'm very astonished and regret the idea that the response
to that should be the changing of taxation to share options. This is no
sort of curious loophole.
''I was responsible in my 1984 Budget for changing the system of
taxation of these options from income tax to capital gains tax for a
very deliberate reason: to encourage people to be entrepreneurial, take
risks, and rescue companies that needed rescuing . . . and to hold
shares in that company.''
He said changing back would damage industry and would not affect the
''fat cats'' at all but those lower down.
Tory MPs and business leaders are also taking a hard line against the
Chancellor, and Sir Richard himself was quoted by one source yesterday
as saying he felt he had been ''caught in the political crossfire'' and
would ''never do anything for public duty again''.
One Tory MP, Mr David Shaw, is setting up a pressure group to fight
the changes. His group is understood to include the former Cabinet
Minister and Mr Major's leadership challenger, John Redwood.
The options available to the Government appear to be some sort of
transitional relief on share options granted before the Chancellor's
announcement on July 17, and a ceiling of #25,000 to #30,000 below which
income tax would not apply.
* Pay deals in private firms are generally keeping pace with
inflation, with over half of recent settlements giving rises of more
than 3%, according to a report. More employers are also supplementing
basic salary rises with other forms of increase, including tax-free,
profit-related pay.
Pay analysts Incomes Data Services said only 38 of 231 private sector
deals struck since April were for less than 3%.
The biggest rise has been in the electronics industry.

NINE months of celebrations to mark the 250th anniversary of Bonnie
Prince Charlie's Jacobite uprising got under way yesterday, starting on
the Hebridean isle of Eriskay yesterday.
The events will reach a climax when thousands of people gather to
commemorate the Battle of Culloden Moor on April 16 next year. The
Eriskay beach where Bonnie Prince Charlie first set foot in Scotland on
July 23, 1745, was the site of a short informal service and re-enactment
of the Young Pretender's arrival.
Appropriately, the commemoration of the Roman Catholic claim to the
British throne was led by Fr Calum MacLellan, the island's priest.
The 200 islanders braved stormy winds and were joined by their
neighbours from the islands of Barra and South Uist.
They saw the island postman, Mr Patrick Forbes, act the part of
Alexander Macdonald, chief of Clan Ranald, who welcomed the Prince,
played by local joiner Alasdair MacInnes, to Eriskay.
The Young Pretender heard the chieftain tell him to return home since
he would not receive enough support in the Highlands.
The Prince replied: ''I am come home, sir.''
Later, Fr MacLellan dedicated a small cairn, built by the children of
Eriskay, to mark the occasion.
He said after the service: ''We just wanted to do our own little bit
to commemorate the Prince's arrival.''

<HEADLINE>Study highlights risk to global financial system. Report calls for beefed upcontrols on conglomerates</HEADLINE>

GLOBAL financial regulators today proposed tightening international
co-operation to close the widening cracks in supervision of financial
conglomerates.
A joint discussion paper released in Zurich by supervisors from the
banking, securities, and insurance industries, proposed boosting
regulators' powers to obtain adequate information.
The report highlights the risk to the global financial system from the
growing number of companies that are taking advantage of deregulation
and internationalisation of markets to offer a wide range of financial
services across the world.
But internationalisation of financial markets and conglomerates is not
matched by supervisors, who remain bound by national borders and explore
issues from their own narrow perspective, leaving a grey area of
supervision.
''Fundamentally, the Tripartite Group agreed that supervision of
financial conglomerates cannot be effective if individual components of
a group are supervised on a purely solo basis,'' the report said.
''The solo supervision . . . needs to be complemented by an assessment
from a group-wide perspective,'' it added.
The collapse of British investment bank Barings in February not only
illustrates the dire consequences of lax controls, but also the threat
posed by a lack of full overview by regulators.
Britain's report on the Baring's debacle found that even the Bank of
England lacked insight into securities operations and questions have
been raised about international co-operation between supervisors.
The report represents a significant step towards creating a truly
international regulatory framework. It is the first time that
supervisors from three key financial regulatory bodies have jointly
tried to close loopholes in the supervisory net.
Representatives from the three groups -- the Basle Committee on
Banking Supervision, the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors
-- joined in a Tripartite Group in 1993 and hope these bodies will
endorse the report.
Ultimately, supervisors hope the proposals could form the basis for a
super-concordat between the regulatory groups.
The emergence of financial conglomerates reflects the blurring
distinction between banks, securities houses, and insurance companies,
many of whom are offering similar services.
But banks, insurers and securities firms are subject to different
regulatory rules.
The supervisors found that effective supervision was in some cases
hampered by how conglomerates were structured and they want the power to
obtain adequate information.
The report proposes appointing lead supervisors, or a convenor, who
would be responsible for gathering the information that is necessary to
understand the risks assumed by the entire conglomerate. -- Reuter

ROSYTH dockyard has won Ministry of Defence contracts worth #53m,
including a #27m order for a refit of the Type-42 destroyer HMS
Newcastle.
The chairman of Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd, Mr Allan Smith, recently
told The Herald he was confident of winning the HMS Newcastle contract.
The work will start immediately.
It is the third in the programme of 18 surface warships scheduled for
the Fife yard in work promised after it lost the Trident submarine
refitting contract to Devonport at Plymouth.
The company said yesterday that the work included additions and
alterations to the ship's mechanical and weapons systems and a renewal
of protective coatings throughout the vessel.
The deal follows successful work on other Type-42 destroyers, HMS
Gloucester, HMS York, and HMS Edinburgh, where completion times were
reduced by several weeks over previous refits, increasing availability
of the vessels to the Royal Navy.
The yard has also secured a #10m refit of its first Type-22 frigate,
HMS Coventry. Work will start when she berths later this year.
Significantly, her refit was part of the Defence Ministry's
unallocated programme and was won in competition. The refit will last 12
months.
The yard's small ships division completed the hat-trick of awards by
receiving contracts to refit three different classes of smaller naval
vessels, worth #16m.
It will refit the dual role fishery protection and offshore patrol
ship, HMS Dumbarton Castle, the mine counter-measures vessel, HMS
Cattistock, and the fishery protection ship, HMS Shetland.
Mr David Batty, managing director of Babcock Rosyth Defence, said

<HEADLINE>Masterly deception for Lewis festival cause. Curse is a hoax in chess moves</HEADLINE>

IT is a classic tale of kings and queens, deception, and a deadly
curse stretching back into the swirling Scottish mists of the twelfth
century.
The plot would grace any historical blockbuster, but instead it is set
to play on the boards today -- at the Isle of Lewis Chess Festival.
The festival, the strongest chess tournament organised in Scotland, is
being held in Stornoway over the next four days to mark the temporary
return to the Western Isles of the ''priceless'' twelfth century Lewis
Chessmen.
Since being discovered in 1831 at Uig, on the west of the island, the
78 hand-carved walrus tusk pieces, featuring the startled expressions of
almost crouched figures, have been kept by the British Museum.
However, the Lewis Chess Club has mounted a campaign to have the
pieces, which are undoubtedly Viking works of art, returned permanently
to the Outer Hebrides for display in the new Museum nan Eilean (Isles
Museum) in Stornoway.
Club chairman Alasdair Macleod, a college lecturer, said: ''Five
million chess players around the world have heard of and know the Lewis
Chessmen. There is no reason why we could not have a visitor centre
dedicated to them here.
''They belong here. They would bring in a lot more money here than
they do at the British Museum in London.''
At the weekend Mr Macleod sent a chill down the nation's spine when he
told Radio Scotland that the Lewis Chessmen were cursed and that anyone
involved with the pieces before they had been buried had died a horrible
death. The British Museum was now stealing them, which meant the curse
would fall on the museum, he said.
Yesterday, however, Mr Macleod admitted the curse had all been a hoax.
''People are interested in deception, not the facts, and I'm happy to
provide anything we can generate against the British Museum.
''Our ultimate aim is to get the chessmen back and our real weapon is
bad publicity for the museum. The curse is helping tremendously.''
Such has been his success that Mr Macleod has persuaded the British
Museum to give them the 78 chess pieces on loan for the first three
months of the new museum. ''But they refused to allow us to use the
chessmen for a special exhibition match,'' he said.
His other coup has been in getting big names such as grandmaster Nigel
Short, who met Gary Kasparov in a memorable televised clash in 1993, top
woman player 18-year-old Judit Polgar, Norwegian grandmaster Simen
Agdestein and Scottish champion Paul Motwani, a Dundee mathematics
teacher, to make their way to Stornoway.
Nigel Short now lives in Athens, where there is keen interest in the
fate of the Lewis Chessmen. Parallels are being drawn there with the
long-running dispute between the British Museum and the Greek Government
over the return of the Elgin Marbles.
All four champions will take part in an invitation grandmaster
tournament. One of them will then take on 30 other players at the same
time at the town's Cabarfeidh Hotel on Thursday.
The tournament, which has attracted 230 entrants from around the UK
and Europe, will also feature the Scottish Co-op Open Championships.

THE Duke of York's decision to use a Queen's Flight jet to visit the
Open at St Andrews was defended by Buckingham Palace yesterday.
It was claimed the duke could have saved nearly #4500 of taxpayers'
money by using a scheduled passenger flight from Heathrow Airport to
Edinburgh.
The duke, a keen golfer who plays off a 10 handicap, flew into the
Fife RAF base at Leuchars on board a BAe 146 of the Queen's Flight
before making the short trip to St Andrews by road.
After watching play, he lunched with senior club officials before
going on to meet visiting former US President George Bush and his wife
Barbara.
The royal visitor, who is an honorary member of the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club, then returned to Leuchars to fly out of the area.
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ''There are laid down procedures
for the use of aircraft by members of the royal family. This one went
through that process. The duke was on official business.''
The duke, in bottle green blazer and dark trousers, was almost
unnoticed by the huge crowds as he strode past the grandstands to follow
the pairing of England's Peter Baker and his Ryder Cup colleague from
Spain, Jose-Maria Olazabal.
* The palace dismissed as ''total exaggeration'' a report in the News
of the World that the Queen Mother had been left stranded with a
bleeding leg -- the one that is still bandaged -- after a fall in the
grounds of Balmoral last autumn.

THE scene is set for an intriguing first face to face meeting later
today between the Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and representatives
of Scotland's largely Labour-controlled local authorities.
Councillors are as uncertain as most other interest groups in Scotland
about the real agenda of the new man at the Scottish Office.
They are anxious to test his recent claim that he wants to increase
the accountability of quangos and to see whether or not he is really
serious about wanting to end the drift of power to the centre over the
last 16 years.
On the key issue of a possible end to the capping of council budgets
they believe they may be pushing at an already open door.
Reports from Whitehall suggest that discussions on a possible end to
capping are now being conducted at Cabinet committee level under Deputy
Prime Minister Michael Heseltine.
If Treasury concerns could be overcome there are no technical reasons
why the regime could not be scrapped in time to allow the new unitary
councils more freedom to set their first budgets for 1996-97.
Such a move would delight many Tory activists who believe people who
vote Labour at local polls have for too long been shielded from the full
impact of high spending policies by the threat of Government
intervention.
Speaking in advance of the meeting between the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities and Mr Forsyth, the Scottish Local Government
Minister, Mr George Kynoch, said Ministers were ''in a listening mode''
and were anxious to hear Cosla's arguments on capping and other issues.
He recognised that the removal of capping was a subject exercising
many people's minds in the Tory Party at present. However, the
Government had to ensure there was a balance between local
accountability and responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure there was
tight control of public spending.
Cosla's Labour senior vice president, Councillor Keith Geddes, said
the removal of capping would be ''a significant watershed'' in the
relationship between central and local government as it would allow
councils some flexibility in drawing up budgets based on locally
determined needs.
He claimed, however, that local government would still face serious
financial difficulties because of the fact that it only controlled
around 15% of its own income through the council tax.
In addition, the Government was planning continued cutbacks in
financial support, said Councillor Geddes. Cosla calculated that a
proposed 0.9% reduction in councils' income for next year would mean a
rise of 6% to 7% in council tax just to maintain present service levels.
Mr Kynoch was warning that councils could expect the present tight
restraints on public spending to continue. The Government was
''absolutely resolute'' in its financial targets.
In a statement at the weekend Cosla's other vice president,
Independent Councillor Peter Peacock, said he was encouraging his
colleagues to take a positive approach to dealing with the the new
Scottish Secretary.
By putting forward a strong agenda for the development of local
democracy and accountability Cosla could test Mr Forsyth's commitment to
be working with the people of Scotland.

FIVE people were killed and two others were injured in four crashes on
Scotland's roads at the weekend.
In one incident, two men died when their car apparently went out of
control before hitting a wall in Main Street, Jamestown, Dumbarton, just
before 2.30am on Saturday. Both men are thought to have died instantly.
No other vehicle was involved.
The men, both 29, from Beechwood Drive, Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, were
named later as driver Stuart Graham and passenger Robert Campbell.
Meanwhile a 15-year-old youth from Banchory, Grampian, died on
Saturday and two other teenagers suffered minor injuries after their
Vauxhall car crashed on a Borders' country road.
Lothians and Borders Police said the 17-year-old driver, who comes
from Glasgow but has not been named, apparently lost control of the
vehicle causing it to overturn on to a grass verge as it headed
southwards on the Duns to Longformacus road about 10.20pm.
The dead youth, who was a rear seat passenger in the car, was named
yesterday as Allan Adams, 15, of Nether Brandsmyres, Banchory.
A 21-year-old motorcyclist who was killed on Saturday after his
machine apparently went out of control and struck a Land Rover on
Stewarton Road, near to Caldcoats Farm Road, Newton Mearns, was named
yesterday as Mr Craig McMeekin, of Merrygreen Place, Stewarton.
Mr McMeekin was taken to the Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow, after the
accident, which happened about 9.25am, but was found to be dead on
arrival. The driver of the Land Rover was not injured.
Highland Constabulary reported that a man died from injuries he
suffered after being thrown from his car when it left the A859 Stornoway
to Tarbert Road, at Leurbost, in Lewis, early yesterday. Again no other
vehicle is believed to have been involved. Inquiries into the incident,
which happened about 1.45am, were continuing. The victim's name is being
withheld until his next of kin have been informed.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth is continuing his fight to save the
Fort William sleeper service. He stated yesterday that he was determined
to ensure that at least some level of service was maintained.
He says he has put the arguments as robustly as he can to the railway
franchise director, and had devised new arguments for its retention with
the benefit of time and the consultation exercise.
But in a televised interview for the BBC's Scottish Lobby programme,
the Secretary of State conceded that if the sleeper trains were finally
removed, then the media would present it as a setback for himself, and
if he was successful it would ''probably appear at the bottom of page
nine somewhere''.
Giving an insight into political fatalism, he explained to interviewer
John Foster: ''That is politics. I take the view that I will fight
whether or not I think I can succeed, and I suppose I'll just have to
put up with the failures and the ignominy which will descend upon my
head.
''But I think most fair-minded people would say that the Secretary of
State should fight his corner, and fight it as well as possible, and
give credit for the successes and even give credit for the failures,
because you can't win them all.''
Political observers argue that Mr Forsyth is attempting to make the
Scottish Conservatives more attractive to voters by taking a more
populist stance -- such as defending the sleeper service -- than his
predecessor, Mr Ian Lang.
Mr Forsyth though was having none of that argument. It was quite
fatuous, he insisted, to suggest that Mr Lang had been any less
committed to achieving a result than he was, and that he had fought
''very hard'' for the Fort William service.
As to whether he himself was more up-front than Mr Lang, who had a
reputation for operating more behind the scenes, Mr Forsyth argued that
to the public it did not matter a row of beans how people operated, and
what mattered to them at the end of the day was whether there was a
sleeper service or not.
However, Mr Forsyth came in for immediate political criticism for his
comments on the resignation of Scottish Nuclear chairman James Hann last
week in the run-up to the merger of Scottish Nuclear with the larger
Nuclear Electric company in England.
Mr Forsyth stated that the arrangements were made before he took
office, and that he had not been involved. He said they were really
matters for the Department of Trade and Industry.
Labour's industry spokesman Brian Wilson said it was a typical case of
Mr Forsyth ''weaseling'' his way out of taking responsibility for
unpopular decisions.
''He does this Pontius Pilate approach whereby every bit of bad news
has nothing to do with him. Yet he is still the Minister responsible for
Scottish Nuclear and if he does not realise it then somebody should tell
him,'' said Mr Wilson.
''The so-called merger of the two companies is now looking very much
like a takeover. The Scottish interest is not being protected, and
Forsyth is failing in his job. He appears to neither know nor care what
the implications in Scotland will be.''

CONDITIONS for IRA inmates at Full Sutton Prison in York are
deteriorating, the leader of a delegation of Irish parliamentarians
claimed yesterday.
Mr Joe Costello was speaking after a visit to the jail where the
four-man group spoke with six terrorists including members of the
''Balcombe Street gang'' for more than an hour.
The visit came amid growing tension over the fate of Republican
prisoners on the mainland, seen as a potential stumbling block in the
peace process.
Full Sutton inmates are concerned that the current ''dirty protest''
by IRA prisoners at Whitemoor Jail, Cambridgeshire, might hamper their
chances of transfer to Ireland, said Mr Costello.
But a report in yesterday's Observer claimed that up to 20 terrorists
held in mainland jails were set for early repatriation to the Republic.
Calls for release or repatriation of prisoners have intensified since
the release of Private Lee Clegg.
Last night, doubts were expressed over the delegation's planned visits
to Whitemoor and Belmarsh Jail in south London.
A Prison Service spokesman said: ''We understand that tomorrow they
are visiting the other two prisons to meet the prison governors, but not
to visit prisoners.''

A SKYE teacher has succeeded in his bid to cycle around Scotland in
aid of Alzheimer's Scotland. Portree High School's head of business
studies, Mr Angus MacRuary, breezed into the grounds of Dunvegan Castle
on Skye on Saturday at 1pm after completing a gruelling 1500-mile cycle
around the coast of Scotland and the border with England.
The 43-year-old father of two finished the course in 16 days which
included the 2000ft-high mountain pass Bealach na Ba in Applecross and
Berridale Braes in Sutherland -- two of the highest roads in Britain.
Riding against a strong wind and torrential rain between Scourie and
Thurso on day five took its toll and led to muscle and cartilage injury
above the knee, forcing him to abandon the track for nearly three days.
News of his brother's sudden death in Glasgow resulted in a further two
days away to attend the funeral.
''There were a couple of low points and there was always a wee niggle
at the back of my mind about not being able to finish, but knowing I was
doing it for Alzheimer's kept me going,'' he said. ''But I'm glad to get
it over with. Next year I'll do a sponsored sleep-in.''
Giving him moral support throughout the journey were his wife Wilma,
34, a PE and guidance teacher at Portree High, and their two children
Kirstian, five, and Seona, two, who drove alongside him from time to
time.

A POLITICAL storm erupted yesterday over a leaked House of Commons
report claiming 70% of ferries using UK ports did not meet international
safety regulations.
Scottish ferry operators described the claim as nonsense. Caledonian
MacBrayne and P&amp;O Scottish Ferries said all their vessels complied with
national and international standards.
The report into ferry safety by the Commons Transport Select
Committee, due out on Friday, is also expected to state that
three-quarters of the ''roll-on, roll-off'' ferries operating out of the
UK would capsize rapidly if uncontrollable flooding of the car deck took
place.
It is likely to call for big changes in the design of ''ro-ro''
vessels as well as an urgent review of evacuation procedures.
MPs are critical of the lack of buoyancy aids on vessels and worried
about the difficulties in lowering lifeboats from listing ferries.
The report will also highlight 36 ''significant'' collisions involving
ferries in the Channel since 1991 and is expected to call for
publication of a list of Channel ferries which fail to meet safety
standards.
Caledonian MacBrayne, which operates three enclosed car deck ro-ro
ferries in Scotland with a capacity of upward of 100 vehicles and 1000
passengers, dismissed the claims.
Captain Sandy Ferguson, marine superintendent for CalMac, said
yesterday: ''As far as I am concerned the Government doesn't know what
it is talking about. Every one of our ferries meets every requirement
and is as safe as safe can be.''
He described the claims that international standards were not being
met as ''absolute scaremongering''.
CalMac's ro-ro vessels include the #16m Isle of Lewis, which goes into
service next week on the Ullapool-Stornoway route to replace the
Suilven; the Caledonian Isles, which sails from Ardrossan to Brodick;
and the Isle of Mull, which operates on the Oban-Craignure route.
A spokesman for P&amp;O Scottish Ferries Ltd, which operates four ferries
to the Northern Isles from Aberdeen, also dismissed the claims.
He stated: ''We can't comment on anything specific in the report
because we haven't seen it, but all our ships fully comply with all
legislation, both national and international.''
Industry experts yesterday said the report had either misunderstood
the effect of the 1990 Safety of Life at Sea (Solas) convention, which
governs all international shipping, or the report itself had been taken
out of context.
The Solas regulations, produced by the International Maritime
Organisation, laid down new stability standards for vessels built after
1990.
Existing vessels have been given various periods of time, depending on
their condition, up until the year 2007 to comply and are therefore
still operating within the regulations.
Mr Ian Winkle, senior lecturer in naval architecture and ocean
engineering at Glasgow University, said: ''A large percentage of ships
built before the mid-80s and the beginning of this decade don't
automatically meet these regulations, but they were not designed for
them.
''You allow old vessels time to catch up with the safety standards of
new vessels. They are not breaking any law. They would not be allowed to
sail if they did.
''They are within current regulations and the parliamentary committee
may have failed to understand the implications of the regulations. We
have stronger regulations in the UK than in the rest of the world.''
However, no international convention has, as yet, tackled the cause of
the Estonia and Herald of Free Enterprise disasters.
More than 900 people were killed last September when the Estonia sank
in the Baltic; 190 lives were lost in 1987 when the Herald of Free
Enterprise capsized while sailing from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.

FURIOUS Ulster Unionist MPs yesterday accused the Government of doing
backroom deals with Sinn Fein, as it was disclosed there had been two
recent meetings between the Republicans and Ministers.
Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram, who was involved in the
talks which took place last Tuesday, said yesterday they had been at the
request of Sinn Fein and that the Government would have been
''positively irresponsible'' if it had not responded.
The Unionists, however, were outraged, and openly accused the
Government of betrayal.
The meeting in Londonderry involving Mr Ancram, Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, and
senior party member Martin McGuinness had followed a previous one held
in private between Mr Ancram and Mr McGuinness.
Mr Ancram, briefing reporters yesterday at Hillsborough Castle, was
asked if the relationship between the Government and Sinn Fein had been
improved. He replied: ''What is important is to make sure processes
don't fail because of misunderstandings, and one of the importances of
having meetings of this kind where you can discuss things directly and
frankly outside the glare of publicity is that misunderstandings can be
removed.''
He denied the meetings were ''secret'' as such, claiming they simply
had been held in private so that both sides could explain their
positions outside the full glare of publicity.
Mr Ancram said it had enabled the Government to see if a way could be
found to take the peace process forward, and he told the news
conference: ''It is worth remembering that the peace does not belong to
them or to us, it belongs to the people of Northern Ireland. It is
rooted in their hearts and in their minds.
''They want this peace to continue. They want to see their
representatives talking and finding a way through. On that basis we
think it was absolutely right that these meetings were conducted in the
way they were.''
Mr Ancram would not say whether progress had been made on specific
issues, but dismissed as ''just speculation'' reports that the talks had
touched on the eventual disarming of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
The Minister said he hoped the meetings would not increase any
distrust in the Government, but the Unionists reacted with deep anger.
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone,
said: ''We are being betrayed by the Government, which is holding
clandestine meetings behind closed doors which they try to keep quiet
from the public.''
His colleague, Mr William Ross, from East Londonderry, said: ''If they
did not have something to hide, why did they not admit that the meeting
had taken place? It appears some sort of deal between Sinn Fein and the
Government has been thrashed out. It was a very important meeting. This
was a critical meeting and some deal must have been done.''
The revelation of the secret talks came while a five-strong
Irish-American delegation was holding a series of meetings with
loyalists and Sinn Fein representatives in Belfast. Sir Patrick and the
Irish deputy premier, Mr Dick Spring, are due to meet today for further
talks about the peace process.
Mr Adams said the meeting with Sir Patrick had focused on the
stalemate in the peace process but had failed to break it. The Sinn Fein
leader described the two-hour discussions as ''businesslike'', but
reported no great optimism that all-party negotiations on the future of
Northern Ireland soon would get under way, declaring that there was ''no
indication the deadlock would be broken''.
Mr Adams said the fact that his meeting with Sir Patrick had gone
ahead meant the British Government had recognised that there was an
impasse in the peace process and that there would be a crisis if it was
not ended.
''We are going to have to have future meetings if we are going to
break this impasse and move the situation on,'' he said.

A MURDER inquiry was launched in Renfrewshire yesterday after a
post-mortem examination confirmed that a man had died from gunshot
wounds while taking a short-cut through a public park.
Police said Mr Kenneth Greenlees, 24, of Dundonald Avenue, Johnstone,
was shot as he crossed the town's Thomas Shanks park en route to a local
bar just before 11pm on Saturday.
Police refused to confirm that the murder was the latest incident in a
recent spate of gangland shootings in the Paisley area.
The Paisley North Labour MP, Mrs Irene Adams, has conducted an almost
single-handed campaign against drug barons in her constituency. The
campaign took on a new urgency some weeks ago after the shootings began.
Police said yesterday that Mr Greenlees's death was being treated as
''suspicious''. It was confirmed that he had been shot several times.
A police spokesman said there was nothing at present to suggest the
incident was in any way connected to the recent shooting incidents in
Renfrewshire. He added, however, that inquiries were still at ''a very
early stage''.
Detectives appealed for witnesses, who may have seen anyone acting
suspiciously or heard gunshots, to contact the inquiry room set up at
Paisley police station.
In May, Strathclyde's Chief Constable Leslie Sharp declared that a
change in the local culture was the reason for Renfrewshire's current
upsurge of criminality, with drugs and money-lending criminals routinely
using guns.
Mr Sharp, while stating that the police, not the criminals, were in
charge of the streets of Paisley and Renfrewshire, demanded that local
people stop trying to solve their problems in their own way and give
unstinted support to the police.
A number of police operations, including Operation Dragon, were
launched to address the problem.
A series of arrests were made in Paisley and the surrounding areas..

MORE than 1300 British soldiers were sent in to protect the besieged
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo last night with orders to hit back if the
Serbs attack again.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo stressed there was ''no shift
towards war'', although the Royal Artillery were bringing in ''the
biggest guns in Bosnia''.
As the Bosnian Serb military leader, General Ratko Mladic, was warned
of air strikes in a face-to-face meeting with military chiefs of the
Allies, troops from Task Force Alpha, the British contingent of the UN's
Rapid Reaction Force, were last night moving in to the Mount Igman area,
10 kilometres outside the city. Their role is to keep secure a route
open for convoys.
The move followed the deaths of two French peacekeepers, both
captains, during attacks at the weekend by the Bosnian Serb Army on
Sarajevo. The Serbs carried out a mortar, rocket and tank attack on a UN
base and convoy. Three UN soldiers were also injured.
The UN force heading for the capital also contained a 500-strong
armoured column of the French Foreign Legion.
The pressure on the ground against the Serbs was matched on the
diplomatic front. The British, French, and US governments last night
officially informed General Mladic of their decision to mount
''substantial air actions'' if military action is taken against the safe
haven of Gorazde.
Military officers from the three countries delivered the message in
person to General Mladic in Belgrade. The statement he was given also
backed up the US threat that attacks on other safe havens would be
punished. ''They (Bosnian Serbs) must realise that necessary action will
be taken in response to attacks elsewhere, including in other safe
areas.''
However, the deployment, plus the warnings, appeared to have little
immediate effect on the Bosnian Serbs. There were reports of fighting
all over Bosnia yesterday.
Shells rained down on Sarajevo itself, killing at least six civilians,
including a baby, wounding 35, and leaving streets deserted.
Rebels stepped up an onslaught on the north-western ''safe area'' of
Bihac, forcing government soldiers and refugees to flee.
A huge explosion rocked the centre of the Serb stronghold of Pale. The
Paris newspaper Liberation said it could have been a bomb dropped by a
French plane.
In the eastern ''safe area'' of Zepa, heavy shelling and shooting
continued for the third day since government troops refused Serb
conditions for surrender.
Zepa has been on the verge of falling since Wednesday when General
Mladic prematurely announced its surrender. UN efforts to mediate a
surrender of the enclave have borne no fruit. About 17,000 Muslims are
believed to be trapped in the town.
Despite the continuing battles, it was hoped the influx of troops
would deter at least the attacks on the capital.
''If we get slaughtered like last night, we can make very heavy
response,'' said UN military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Vernon.
The new force ''will allow us to respond far more effectively''.
The UN was last night refusing to confirm the number of troops
involved in the movement but the British Forces' spokesman said it was
believed 1300 British personnel would be deployed.
The Ministry of Defence in London said 700 troops from the 1st Devon
and Dorset Regiment, equipped with Warrior armoured personnel carriers,
would form the bulk of the British presence in Sarajevo.
Together with a 100-strong force from the Household Cavalry, they have
been told to ''mark out and secure'' the treacherous Mount Igman route
and enable supplies to reach the city.
But they have also been ordered to respond to any further attacks from
the Bosnian Serbs as the UN seeks to reaffirm its authority.
Nearly 400 troops from 19 Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery have
also been deployed in the area to strengthen the defences of the
besieged city together with 12 of the regiment's 105mm guns -- ''the
biggest guns in Bosnia'', the Ministry of Defence claimed.
They will be joined by 100 personnel from the Armed Engineer Troop,
with specially designed mine-sweeping armoured ''tractors'', and eight
Lynx helicopters from the Army Air Corps for transporting supplies to
the troops and reconnaisance.
It was uncertain last night how the Serbs would respond to the show of
force. They seized about 360 UN peacekeepers in May after Nato planes
bombed the Pale headquarters.
They made a mockery of the international community by seizing the UN
''safe area'' of Srebrenica July 11, evicting an estimated 30,000
Muslims and reportedly killing or capturing thousands more.
The Dutch Defence Minister said Dutch troops witnessed Serb soldiers
executing Muslims after capturing another Srebrenica.
It is the first time British troops have been operationally deployed
in Bosnia, but Mr Portillo went to great lengths to stress that Britain
was not at war.
He said the Rapid Reaction Force's role was to protect the UN
peacekeeping forces and ''to try and bring some peace and security . . .
wherever that is possible, and enable humanitarian convoys to reach
people who would otherwise be starving. If we could have a secure
overland route that would be the best guarantee of survival for Sarajevo
and its people.
''This was conceived to enable the United Nations to go on doing its
job and protect these brave people,'' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At
One.
''There is no shift in any sense from peacekeeping to war fighting. We
simply wish to provide protection to peacekeepers who are trying to save
lives in Bosnia.''
Mr Portillo issued a strong warning to the Bosnian Serbs not to attack
the other threatened ''safe haven'' of Gorazde more than 200 miles from
Sarajevo and with 200 British troops among the UN garrison.
The Defence Secretary said the ''most powerful deterrent'' remained
the use of air strikes.
''We want to make it very clear, and we will make it very clear in
language that cannot be misunderstood, to the Bosnian Serbs that if they
attack Gorazde there will be a substantial and decisive response.
''It is the deterrent of air power that I believe can be effective.
''But I would not dream of fighting a war with air power and I would
not dream of fighting a war in Bosnia. That is not what the United
Nations is there to do.''
He said the best thing he could do was issue a deterrent that was
clear and unambiguous, delivered directly to the Bosnian Serbs so they
could understand the ''terrible consequences'' if they chose to attack.
A spokesman for the British Forces in Vitez, where the Rapid Reaction
Force has been stationed to date, backed up Mr Portillo's assurances
that British troops were not at war.
''They are being operationally deployed but we are not at war. We are
still working to the UN mandate,'' he said.

Theatre
WELL, it wasn't the ''most exciting event of 1995''. But it did
contain at least two of the most beautiful theatrical moments that I
hope to see all year. And to see Angus Farquhar and his NVA Organisation
trying and failing is infinitely preferable to seeing any number of
average productions achieve their mediocre aims with competence.
The most persuasive thing on NVA's side was the set, a natural
landscape of Glasgow's industrial past spliced by the River Clyde. You
couldn't have designed it better. The audience sat on two large seating
banks overlooking a patch of wasteland on which Sativa Drummers marched,
gangs of anonymous clones trotted back and forth, banging, brushing,
flashing lights, and DJs pummelled out a relentless percussive score.
Somewhere in the midst of it all, a stately Ronald Fraser Munro
delivered fragmented pearls of wisdom (''Our future is in the heart of a
child'' -- indeed!), while the whole thing was filmed live and projected
on to the side of a nearby warehouse, mixed with groovy graphics and
images downloaded from the Internet.
Over the river, sparks would fly from the semi-completed hull of a
cargo ship, sculptures of light would shimmer on the dockside and --
best of all -- four perfectly synchronised cranes would rotate, arms
outstretched like ballet dancers, or trundle along, illuminated in
primary colours against the night sky.
This was poetry, affecting and magical in itself and also adding real
poignancy to Farquhar's theme about the loss of our industrial heritage.
But big spaces need big ideas and, except for the cranes, too much of
Stormy Waters was fussy and fuzzy. Unlike Farquhar's exceptional 1991
warehouse show, The Second Coming, in which armies of performers created
vivid patterns of movement, Stormy Waters frequently felt like bad
community theatre where it's more important for everyone to do their bit
than for clear, distinct ideas to be put across.
There were moments -- like the chain of boilersuited figures each with
a giant bar code stamped on the back -- but the fact that the most
absorbing visuals were in the sophisticated mix of images projected on
the wall merely reminded you that not enough attention had been paid to
the live theatrical spectacle.
The scale was so vast that it would have taken the arrival of a fleet
of helicopters to round off the performance in true theatrical style,
but even without those resources it was a shame that Stormy Waters
didn't so much finish as fizzle out.
It was significant in other ways, however. This was theatre for the
trance-dance generation, a performance that worked through the
combination and juxtaposition of images, ideas, repetitions. Not linear
but lateral. And as such it was a sharper reflection of the mood, the
style, and the experience of a generation than anything you're likely to
see on a conventional stage all year.

A nun, an abbot, stolen kisses after service, and the trauma of
leaving holy order to marry. It sounds like the plot of a romantic
novel: in fact the story is true. Jenny Nisbet meets the characters
We'd struggle to be noble when all we wanted was some chance to
explore this new quickening
There was an almost unbearable sweetness in accidentally touching his
hand
WHY do women go ga-ga over the clergy? From Chaucer's Nun's Priest's
Tale to Joanna Trollope's latest opus, and the tribulations of the Dean
of Lincoln, the British like nothing better than a good scandal in the
cloisters.
Hapless vicars, priests, and ministers have fallen like skittles under
the attentions of decidedly unvirtuous women. But so far
twelfth-century, red sandstone Carlisle Cathedral has remained haughtily
aloof from such gaudy goings on.
Now, however, 46-year-old Helen Weston, the wife of their senior canon
warden, is about to delight, intrigue, and shock the congregation with
her latest book. It is the deeply emotional story of a novice nun who
falls hopelessly in love with the handsome abbot she meets at a church
convention. The story tells of snatched kisses after service, stolen
moments over hymn books, and the trauma of leaving holy order to marry.
It is autobiographical.
''We'd struggle to be noble when all we wanted was some chance to
explore this new quickening,'' she writes. ''He seemed like the perfect
monk. His face was austerely beautiful with only a glimmer of sensuality
about the lips. When I stood next to him in the services in chapel there
was an almost unbearable sweetness in sharing a book with him, or
accidentally touching his hand.''
No doubt Canon Weston's parishioners will now be looking at him in an
interesting new light. At 58, he is still a strikingly attractive man in
a white-haired, aesthetic sort of way. Helen, too, could have stepped
straight from the pages of a Joanna Trollope. In jeans and check shirt,
she makes lunch in the large, airy, abbey house with its vast terracotta
painted hall and finely panelled rooms.
Slim and urchin-haired, with rich Lancastrian vowels and a strong,
independent stamp, it is hard to imagine Helen ever being a nun, even an
Anglican one. Yet from the age of 26 she was a novice for five years.
She is not in the Jean Simmonds or Claire Bloom (so becoming in a habit)
mould.
And despite the odd purple passage, the Oxford-educated Helen insists
that her book, The Winter Is Past, billed as a ''love story which bursts
the bounds of the cloisters,'' is no Mills and Boon.
Of course, a monk presents a certain unobtainable challenge to a
woman, the very stuff of great romance, but Helen says: ''I didn't want
to relate to this monk/abbot character, I wanted the man. I had broken
out of religious life, the last thing I wanted was a man in Holy
Orders.''
Their love affair, which started when she was 32 and approaching the
end of her time at the convent, was conducted by correspondence, and the
occasional idyllic but chastely romantic meeting.
After one such encounter, David wrote to her of the physical
exhilaration he had experienced. ''According to the laws of
thermo-dynamics I ought to have exploded, melted or disappeared in a
cloud of steam. But such laws seemed to have been in abeyance for the
day,'' he gasped.
In some ways Helen's book follows the traditional romantic formula of
girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy. She doesn't find anything
incongruous in the fact that the ''girl'' happened to be a nun and the
''boy'' a monk.
''I went into the convent because I had a romantic ideal, I thought
heroic self sacrifice was wonderful,'' she says. ''The smell of incense
and sound of plain chant had a strong effect on me. Perhaps I'm a bit
less romantic now than I used to be. Because I took it to the extreme,
it was burnt out of me. In the convent you couldn't go to the bathroom
without wearing a veil. In a strange way, the relgious life was a
respectable way of going wild.''
She doesn't find it odd that so many committedly religious people
appear to get embroiled in romantic or sexual entanglements.
''The interesting thing about people who enter a community, whether
it's a Christian one or a Buddhist one, is that they quite often have
two extremes to their natures,'' she says. ''They can be very austere
and very extravagant, very aesthetic and very sensual. It's as if they
can't do anything by halves. David could be a bishop or he could be a
beachcomber -- nothing in between.''
So in this ordinary tale of religious folk, Helen met David at a
church community project in London. He was 44. ''David was very relieved
to find that I was not 22 as he had thought. The ''pristine'' look he
had perceived in me was no doubt due to the convent phenomenon of
magically preserving the skin wrinkle-free,'' she says.
''When we first met I realised something was happening, David realised
a bit later. Things are always a bit thunder-clappish with me. At first
it was just lovely to have a warm feeling inside, but I didn't think it
would go anywhere at all.
''In the religious life framework, it's very hierarchical. In normal
circumstances a junior sister wouldn't even talk to anyone as senior as
an abbot unless you were asked a question. We were poles apart. And
there was no indication that he was the kind of monk who was
discontented, he looked rock solid, so it was a very dangerous emotional
minefield.''
But as Helen came to realise the austere, saintly-looking monk was
actually in a very vulnerable state. ''The image he used to describe his
own feeling within the monastery was that of being ''deep frozen''. He
spoke of the advantages of having one's feelings so numbed, but the main
impression was one of resignation,'' she says.
''Also his mother had died a year before he met me. Suddenly although
he still had the monastery (a Lutyens mansion, Nashdom in
Buckinghamshire) his home had gone, there was no anchor anymore. And
somebody coming along at that time, showing warmth and sensitivity, to
him must have seemed irresistible.''
As we all know the course of true love never runs smooth. Helen left
her closed community, as she had intended before meeting David, but he
felt a renewal of his vocation and decided that he had to reject Helen's
love.
It is one thing to fight another woman, but quite another when your
rival is God. Helen, while understanding his commitment to his monastic
vows, was shattered.
''When David rejected me I began to feel that I was being called upon
to make heroic sacrifices,'' she says. ''I felt as if I was in a re-run
of the Abraham Isaac story. My initial reaction to God was 'this is too
much. You can't ask this of me and expect me to keep thinking you're
brill.' I thought 'is God really on the side of the man?' Does he
actually prefer to have an abbot in a monstery.''
They spent a long, miserable year apart as David went through the
''agonies of decision'' which finally led to him deciding to leave the
monastery. The star-crossed pair were finally reunited in the unlikely
romantic setting of Liverpool's Lime Street Station. ''Vintage Brief
Encounter'' before David returned to Nashdom for the last time.
And so like all the best romances The Winter Is Past ends with a
blissful wedding and a honeymoon in Venice. Not that everyone shared
their joy. Their marriage, 11 years ago, didn't make the down-market
tabloids, but the Oxford Mail carried a sniffy piece and they made the
front page of the Church Times.
Canon Weston who has returned from the dentist with their boisterous
sons, Luke, nine, and Alexander, five, is not all that enchanted with
himself as hero of his wife's tale.
''I'm embarrassed by myself because I appear to be such a waverer and
I caused a lot of heartache. But at the end of the day one of the
virtues of the book is that Helen hasn't put us in a better light.
Everything is written exactly as it occurred.
''Even if I hadn't met Helen, I would eventually have left the
monastery,'' he continues. ''I was elected Abbot at 36 for life, and I
was running out of energy. For a man perceptions of God are often
paternalistic and I was brought up with a strict Victorian grandfather
so I think I made God in his image.
''Someone demanding who wasn't easily pleased and who expected
complete obedience. The monastic life was a lot about discipline,
perseverance, all those things and in many ways it suited me.
''I see Helen as a redeemer figure, although it sounds strange, it was
only when I met Helen that I experienced the loving, saving aspects of
God. Now I am more pleased with where I am, and who I am, than I have
ever been.''
David, in his role as Church Warden, now works at integrating the
cathedral with the community, while Helen teaches courses in self
development and is a Relate counsellor.
''No relationship is perfect,'' she says. ''There is still a lot about
David and myself that I would like to heal and explore. As far as work
goes, my ambition is to be a full-time writer, I envy Joanna Trollope
her story-telling skills.''
I suggest that, like Trollope's The Choir, The Winter Is Gone would
make a good TV series. Helen instantly sees Juliet Stephenson playing
her role. But who could play the abbot?
''Hom Hanks,'' volunteers Luke, ''Or Tom Cruise,'' muses Helen. Across
the table the canon sighs deeply, what on earth would the Church Times
have to say about that?

Clare Henry visits an exhibition of powerful pictures from six of
Britain's top artists and finds, despite little gallery guidance,
profoundly different styles linked by a demand for perfection
FRANCIS BACON. Now there's a name to conjure with. And, from the
stream of visitors at Edinburgh's Gallery of Modern Art, still a
crowd-puller. This festival blockbuster boasts another magic name:
Lucian Freud, painter and grandson of Sigmund Freud. These two giants
make it a must to visit From London: Bacon, Freud, Kossoff, Andrews,
Auerbach, Kitaj. If you only see one exhibition this year, I hope it's
this one.
It's a memorable show. Substantial. Significant. Well selected. Well
displayed. A mindblowing array of 100 powerful pictures by six of
Britain's top artists. It reminds us that paint on canvas can still be
exciting and impressive.
Sadly it's no new thrill for metropolitan gallery-goers, as they have
seen it all before. These six, now in their seventies apart from Bacon
who died in 1992 and would have been 83, are the most frequently
exhibited painters in the UK.
However, it's very useful for a Scottish audience who rarely get to
London, and moreover a chance for curator Richard Calvocoressi to pull
out all the stops and orchestrate dynamic links between pictures,
painters, and periods.
Yet amid all the riches, this big-budget exhibition has one huge,
sinful omission which makes me angry. It does not consider the public.
Despite charging #3.50 (#2 concessions) for admission, there is little
to help you understand and appreciate the show. The paintings have basic
labels. Each artist has a short biography. After that you're on your
own. The #15 catalogue is not much help either.
National and civic galleries have a real responsibility to inform and
help. They should not assume that every visitor is an expert -- indeed
if that is the case, they are failing in their task.
The GMA should take a lesson from Neil Macgregor, director of London's
National Gallery, who has an excellent track record of putting pictures
in context.
In Edinburgh there is just one tiny concession to visitors. In the
first room devoted to Michael Andrews, a small panel explains his move
from pictures with figures, albeit small (like The Pier Pavilion where
tiny figures straggle along the beach), to eerily serene, deserted,
sometimes Scottish, landscapes. Lights: Out of Doors 1970 features a
hot-air balloon floating over Gloucestershire. The documentation
explains that ''Lights' really means enlightenment; Andrews was studying
Zen; the balloon is a metaphor for selfhood or ego-abnegation, a theory
of ''skin-encapsulated ego'' that interested him at that time. No way a
visitor could guess that, so it's nice to be told. But what about the
rest? Bacon's Oresteia of Aeschylus? Most people could do with a clue
here too.
These six artists, collectively known as The School of London, have
such profound stylistic differences as to make a nonsense of trying to
lump them together into a commercially marketable package.
Take for instance the gap between Andrews's restrained, fastidious,
romantic tastefulness, Kossoff's vomit-coloured skeins of oil or
Auerbach's agonised, impasto-laden tangled crags of drab gooey paint so
thick it is sculptural. Then there's Kitaj's busy, fragmented, colourful
compositions built up of countless glimpses, references, thoughts and
experiences all on one canvas. Poles apart.
They themselves admit to being ''a herd of differing loners''. Most
are reclusive, obsessive, compulsive painters. Aloof from prevailing
fashions, they follow Sickert's advice, ''There is only one thing for
painters to do -- keep their heads down and work''.
The sole unifying factors are their commitment to the human form and
their passion for paint.
Bacon is at the centre of the group, and one look at his famous
screaming Pope or the huge, marvellous, epic triptychs from 1981 and
1983 tells you why. The tension is palpable.
Only Bacon could predict and prefigure cyberspace. ''His grandeur of
ambition has pulled up British painting,'' says Auerbach. Bacon exploits
myth in his exploration of that great twentieth-century theme: the
isolation of man. Like Freud, his tortured, grimacing, deformed,
despairing figures are usually alone in a barren, empty space. Surreal
drips, smears, and blobs extend the psychological rawness.
''Reality is cruel,'' he said. ''I try to trap realism.'' Freud paints
realism of a different kind. His intense gaze is pitiless, scrutinising
the flesh of solitary figures in desolate rooms, depicting the sag and
sheen of heavy breasts and thighs. His people are always naked, not
nude. His demands on his sitters are legendary: 150 hours, 30-odd
sittings -- even for Baron Tyssen.
An early, amazing picture from 1947, Girl with Roses, painted when he
was 25 and hypnotic in its exactitude, anticipates his chilling current
style. Fifty years on, a brand new oil, Girl in the Attic Doorway and
Female Lying By Rags 1990, are unnerving in their clinical objectivity.
Perfectionism is perhaps another less obvious link between these
painters.
This show is full of ironies. One only has to look at the surnames to
realise that, with the exception of Andrews, The School of London
artists are not English born and bred. Kitaj is especially conscious of
the Diaspora and one of his best works, If Not, Not, 1976  depicts
Auschwitz set, as it actually was, amid particularly beautiful
countryside.
There is another irony. Belatedly the catalogue allows that London and
Glasgow contributed to the phenomenal resurgence of painting and
figuration in the 1980s. Why then has Scotland had to wait so long to
see these artists? In 1989 or 1990 it would have meant a lot more than
it does now.

Jazz
JAZZ musicians come in all shapes and sizes, but not many look like
the one who gave a recital at the RSAMD on Saturday night, as part of
the Academy's International Workshop series. Physically, Randy Sabien
resembles a cross between John-Boy Walton and John Denver.
Musically, there is a strong country influence on Sabien's playing
which is jerky, jagged, and often very percussive. He stands as if he's
playing at a barn dance and on more than one occasion he held the violin
like he would a guitar; an effect which did nothing for Summertime but
worked well on his own haunting compostition, El Dorado.
Various friends joined Sabien onstage, although it was not made clear
which of them had been participants in his workshops. First up was the
best of them -- a Glaswegian violinist called Bill Murphy whose duets
with Sabien brought out the warmth and wit of both players. Their Sweet
Georgia Brown and Minor Swing were the real toe-tappers of the night.
The rest of the selection was dominated by interesting original Sabien
pieces, and for these the violinist was joined by a two-man rhythm
section resembling a couple of chartered accountants. It is to his
credit that he still managed to swing despite this dull duo's uninspired
contribution.

Music
NORMALLY it's a good sign if you come away from a concert carrying a
tune in your head. In this case, the tune wasn't one I'd just heard, but
something about RMS triggered Gary Numan's Are Friends Electric?
Other things triggered different thoughts. There was a passing
resemblance in the vocal delivery to the Pet Shop Boys, and a keyboard
motif that echoed Thomas Dolby.
RMS is built upon the singing, song-writing, and keyboard-playing
skills of one Jimmy X, Man of Mystery, emerging from ''25 years of
obscurity''. He proved to have done his homework, certainly with regard
to the mechanics of composition, and has gathered ideas assiduously.
Where he fell down was in his almost total domination of the group
sound.
With bass and drums pre-programmed, it would have been good to have
heard more from the ''real'' instruments. Guitarist David Robertson
often got lost in the keyboard storm (and in the dry ice too). Dick
Lee's contributions on saxophones and recorder were apposite and
occasionally daring, the treble recorder seldom sounds so flexible in
other hands, and with this sort of imagination harnessed to, rather than
appended to, Jimmy X's seemingly unstoppable flow of song ideas, RMS
could be onto something of their own.

TIME was we blamed the Americans for debasing the English language. A
typical example of this cultural subversion came some time ago in a
memorable news agency report of a coup in Africa. ''People jubilated on
the streets,'' it said, noting that the victims would be ''funeralised
Friday''.
Here in Brussels our European partners make the Yanks look like
amateurs when it comes to the torture of poor old English. There's no
mystery about the source of the ghastly jargon which is now at a stage
so advanced that conversation about Euro-matters is impenetrable to
almost everyone below Foreign Minister level.
The French are the main culprits. They produce political doctrines
which often have no precise equivalent in English: thus ''subsidiarity''
is held to mean devolution from Brussels to the member states.
In recent times the jargon virus has become uncontainable. Only last
week the European Union invented a phrase which will live in the lexicon
of the worst Euro-verbiage. The ingenious Eurocrats who brought you
''paper fish'' as a means of solving a fisheries dispute and ''variable
geometry'' as the blueprint for a politically flexible EU presented
their latest buzzword in Strasbourg. We now must learn to live with the
notion of ''constructive abstention''.
Constructive abstention is a wheeze favoured by EU Ministers who are
like sheep when it comes to adopting jargon. They feel insecure if one
of their number uses a word they don't understand. To show that they,
too, are masters of the misuse of language they take every opportunity
to show off their skills.
Only Douglas Hurd resisted this trend. He was, of course, a wordsmith
with a natural antipathy to jargon. But now he is gone and there is no
hope, I fear. Mr Rifkind is on probation but at least he has not yet
been tempted into using the latest hideous euphemism for pulling the
troops out of Bosnia under fire. His colleagues have taken to referring
to this possibility as ''withdrawal in a non-benign environment''.
Mr Rifkind would far rather see his soldiers operating in Bosnia under
what is known as ''strategic consent'' -- in other words without Serbs,
Croats, and Muslims simultaneously trying to blow them to bits.
There's lots more. Herald readers might like to bone up on their
Euro-jargon because some grasp of it will be required as we head for
next year's festival of Euro-babble, otherwise known as the 1996
inter-government conference (IGC) to review the Maastricht Treaty. This
teach-yourself jargon service hereby comes free with this issue. Help
yourselves and impress your friends.
You should be aware that it was the IGC which spawned the idea of
''constructive abstention'' (aka ''active'' abstention). It means no
more than a refusal to vote in that glee club of Euro-gobbledygook which
is the Council of Ministers, except that it would not be quite a
national veto. Just a way of allowing one country -- no prizes of
guessing which -- to take the huff by abstaining on some plan or other
while promising not to stop other states pushing ahead.
British officials have helpfully pointed out that active or
constructive abstention is not to be confused with its first cousin in
the Euro-speak family, the so-called ''coalition of the willing'' -- as
if we did not know. A coalition of the willing is a group of states
which can choose to go ahead with a policy which others don't like --
rather as the Germans and Benelux pressed ahead with the removal of
internal borders.
Which leads us to the concept of ''concentric circles'', another near
relative of the coalition of the willing. This idea is, again, inspired
by the French and involves various countries integrating -- or not, as
they wish -- at different speeds. But it has recently fallen out of
fashion, rather like its inventor, Edouard Balladur.
To complicate matters we also have another close relative to both
concentric circles and a coalition of the willing. This is the ''inner
core'' -- a stupid phrase employed to describe countries most anxious to
get a move on with the integration process in areas like the single
currency.
I say stupid, because what is a core if it is not inner? (James
Cameron used to say the same about the Botanic Gardens in Glasgow, a
splendid example of tautology.)
For those of you still with us there is yet more. (Remember some of
these phrases come from the European parliamentary talking shop where a
meeting is called a seance.)
Here's a good one: ''Monetary cohabitation''. Our French friends are
familiar, of course, with the concept of political cohabitation --
anyone else would talk of co-operation -- but this phrase, brought to
you by the new French government, refers to economic matters.
The French are obsessively distrustful of EU states which can't or
won't adopt a single currency at the same time as France. Mr Chirac is
terrified that states outside the single currency could devalue for
competitive advantage. A way must, therefore, be found to let them live
in peace -- if not in sin -- with the new single currency.
The French have also taken to calling this concept ''in-out
cohabitation'' but that is so gross that only the French can be heard
using it these days.
You should also, of course, heed the growing importance of the
''reference scenario''. This is not a piece of paper for someone wanting
a job -- Mr Major next year perhaps? -- but the intended result of
months of discussion among EU Ministers, the Commission, and the gnomes
of Frankfurt, all currently planning the next move towards the single
currency. In plain English it is a recommendation, but that simple
definition would not confer gravitas on a Minister out to impress his
colleagues.
This being Europe, I suggest we act in character and set up a
committee. The Anti-Jargon Committee would feel at home in Brussels
because it would fit neatly into a vast bureaucratic committee system
which is defined by another piece of jargon: ''comitology''. It should
be the first to go. Not a bad starting point or, as they say here,
launch structure.

JOHN Daly, nicknamed Wild Thing, last night won the Open championship
at St Andrews in a dramatic play-off.
Twice banned from the American tour, Daly -- a reformed alcoholic --
took his second major title and declared: ''This is awesome.''
After finishing his final round, Daly led the pursuing pack but was
caught when Italian Costantino Rocca incredibly holed a 60ft putt on the
18th green to force the four-hole play-off.
Rocca lay on the ground stunned by the shot, but over the extra holes
his inspiration dried up, and 29-year-old Daly emerged a comfortable
winner by four shots.
So the 1991 US PGA champion, who finished last in the Open at
Muirfield in 1992 and again at Turnberry last year, was left to savour
the triumph at the home of golf.
Daly said: ''I thought I had won when I finished my final round.
No-one would have dreamt he would hole the putt on the last.
''It was tough to regroup but Brad Faxon and Corey Pavin (fellow
American players) told me to hang in there and told me I could do it.''
The biggest crowd favourite in world golf, Daly has always courted
controversy -- though today he is literally a more sober character after
kicking the drink. Chocolate and cakes are now his only excess.
Daly, who lives in Germantown, Tennessee, proved beyond doubt over
four windswept days at St Andrews that he has the touch of a true
champion.
Despite his much-publicised personal problems, Daly is now happily
married to third wife Paulette, who rushed to embrace him after he sunk
the putt that clinched victory.
The couple were married in January this year and they have a month-old
baby girl called Sierra.
A total of 180,000 spectators attended the Open (practice days
included).
The figure was 28,000 down on the last time the event was held at St
Andrews, in 1990.
Yesterday's attendance figure was 36,000, compared with 44,000 on the
1990 final day.

JOHN BUCHAN, The Presbyterian Cavalier
By Andrew Lownie
Constable: #20
A SUBSTANTIAL new biography of John Buchan must either be a curiosity
or a sign of the times. It is 55 years since he died, scarcely past the
zenith of his popularity as a writer. But by the high standards of his
own ambition and sense of purpose -- inseparable from each other -- he
had not quite succeeded. He was Lord Tweedsmuir and had done well as
Governor-General of Canada, but it was not his first choice for his last
work. And though the polite world praised his biographies of Scott,
Cromwell, and Montrose, it really preferred The Thirty-nine Steps,
possibly even in the travestied Hitchcock film version.
He was, the English agreed, a very clever Scotsman. Some Scots thought
him too anglified. His Commons maiden speech was summed up as quietly
audacious ''in the style of a Scottish son of the manse with an Oxford
education,'' a judgment ratified by surviving recordings of his masterly
BBC commemoration of Sir Walter Scott. But he had not been quite clever
enough (so Mr Lownie argues) to claim the best places in the labyrinth
of power or, when he at last entered Parliament at 51, to become more
than an influential back-bench Tory with mildly cross-bench tendencies.
After Buchan's death and the end of Empire the inevitable reaction set
in, despite Janet Adam Smith's well-informed and balanced biography in
1965. He fell foul of Britain's new inverted snobberies. One influential
critic and her supporting cast constructed a theory of anti-Semitism
which relies on dialogue given to some of his characters, and takes
little or no account of the pro-Zionist views and activities or the
personal friendships which his new biographer sets on record, even more
fully than Dr Adam Smith. He was held to be sexist, racist, and to have
spoken harshly of the Bolsheviks.
But Buchan succeeded where it mattered most. His devotees are a
surprisingly catholic congregation -- where else would I agree with Owen
Dudley Edwards from Dublin and Norman Shanks of Iona? -- and the fullest
measure of devotion is that he remains so widely read. His books are
more available than at any time since 1940, and the justification for a
new biography is that someone so much appreciated ought to be explained,
understood, even introduced to generations for whom his political and
social background seems as remote as Trollope's.
It's a difficult biography to write. As Mr Lowrie says, the biographer
needs ''at least a nodding acquaintance'' with Presbyterian history,
South Africa, the First World War, Nelsons and Reuters, inter-war
politics and Canada. He has to fit into backgrounds from dreaming spires
and Border hills to the highveld and Canadian Arctic. He must cope with
Buchan's prodigious and diverse literary output -- and with readers
ready to challenge on judgments and details.
Is Witch Wood, Buchan's favourite novel, worth only a page? Didn't
Andrew Amos reappear in the French part of Mr Standfast, ''giving thanks
to an Omnipotence in whom he officially disbelieved''? Wasn't the
Prester John villain Henriques a ''Portugoose . . . whose skin spoke of
the tar-brush'' rather than Jewish? Is there confusion with the
Gaelic-speaking German spy whom Richard Hannay codenamed ''the
Portuguese Jew'' but whose name was Ehrlich and whom John S Blenkiron
mourned as ''plumb honest''? Buchanites can be a pedantic lot.
But Mr Lownie has succeeded with a well-written and helpful book. It
is good on Buchan as war historian and rich in quotation and research as
well as discoveries or rediscoveries to please or tease. Who, for
example, will trace the film version of Huntingtower with Sir Harry
Lauder as Dickson McCunn? The book is strong on the complexities of
Buchan's personality and politics, though a reference to a ''1912
election'' needs explanation. It recognises Buchan's neglected value as
a writer about Scots and in Scots, and strikes a fair compromise between
the author's need to describe Buchan's books and his desire to defer to
a forthcoming study from the contemporary literary authority on Buchan,
Professor David Daniell.
However, the author sometimes seems in two minds about his subject,
recognising the depth and complexity of Buchan's writing, and hinting at
the way deeper certainties (and some uncertainties) came through even in
his role as one of the century's ''most successful and influential''
popular writers.
Mr Lownie comes to one misjudgment (at odds with his own excellent
evidence) after debating whether Buchan could ''really have been a great
writer,'' whatever that is. He is allowed strong imagination with strong
moral values ''but his world view was a limited one''.
That calls for a repeated ''No'' in the Thatcherian manner. It was no
limited world view which inspired Buchan's life and works -- explicit in
his serious writing, implicit in the wonderful ''shockers'' that he
wrote for fun and money.
Despite a scattering of references to the two great intellectual
influences on Buchan's thinking, Calvinism and classicism, Mr Lownie
fails to explore and develop sufficiently the implications of his
sub-title (which I used in 1992 for a BBC documentary in which Tom
Fleming read Buchan passages quite superbly). Buchan was not only
himself ''the Presbyterian cavalier '' -- the style he conferred on
Montrose but also allowed to Haig and Stonewall Jackson -- but a lay
theologian of substance (like Gladstone) who combined a liberal theology
with a philosophical, social, and political conservatism. He was also an
ecumenist in theory and practice, living in England, married to an
Anglican, worshipping in the English as well as the Scottish Church, and
serving as elder in Assembly as well as kirk session.
The nodding acquaintance with Church history Mr Lownie invokes has not
prevented run-of-the-mill mistakes and minor errors. Buchan is wrongly
credited with ''presiding'' at the General Assembly in the role which a
dud caption calls ''Lord High Commissioner of the Church of Scotland''.
And the large UF body which reunited with the establishment in 1929 was
not strictly the Free Church, in law or name.
Far more serious is glossing over some of Buchan's best writing and
most profound thinking in the account of the Kirk he wrote (with Sir
George Adam Smith) for that reunion, and the exposition of the place of
Presbyterianism in the world Church which was done best when a world
Reformed conference in Montreal coincided with his governor-generalship.
Buchan saw the Scots Calvinist tradition as a bridge between ''Churches
rich in historic accretions and Churches which lack them''.
Mr Lownie rightly recognises that Buchan's world view, in a political
sense, was no timebound and doctrinaire imperialism, though no-one
better exemplifies the 40% holding (or more) which Scots had in the
British Empire. As a Tory and a unionist he was evolutionary as well as
anti-revolutionary. But he had a profounder world view: of an endangered
civilisation rich in classical and humanist values which must not only
have a Christian basis but ''must ultimately rest on the Christian
Church''.
You do not have to share all or any of that world view to feel your
pulse beat faster with Richard Hannay on the Galloway moors or the
Danube or the Cuillin: to shut up shop and seek adventure with Dickson
McCunn: to find serenity at the last with Edward Leithen. Not even to
appreciate Buchan's insights into Scott and Cromwell or his hero-worship
of Montrose.
But it helps to understand what manner of man occupied this
Interpreter's House -- and who, perhaps, will come to be as identified
in both his life and writing with one phase of Scottish life and history
as Scott was with another. He was a man greater than even the sum of his
many parts.

WHAT'S not going to happen is that this Government or the next will
disinvent the national lottery. And to that extent the collective
beating of media breasts over inequities, misjudgments, the
encouragement of human greed, and the undesirability of the under class
sending the upper class to wallow in Bollinger and Bizet at Covent
Garden is a waste of increasingly precious newsprint. Let me, instead,
offer an utterly heretical thought: the lottery can be a force for
national good.
And some of its critics have contrived to grasp the wrong end of so
many sticks that the practice should clearly be entered as a trial sport
at the next Olympics.
First off, it's plain patronising to witter on about the poor
subsidising the rich.
The fact of the matter is that all of us who hand over a #1 coin in
exchange for half a dozen numbers are not knowingly investing in the
social lives of others whatever our income. We are buying a small piece
of fantasy. There is nobody I've met these past few months who hasn't
indulged in the pleasant day dream of constructing a post-win scenario
rich in sun-kissed villas and letters of well-worded invective to
erstwhile employers. A pound isn't an expensive escape from reality
however temporary the respite.
Some of the people who do win will self-destruct: that is an
unpalatable truth. But we can no more prevent that now that the lottery
is established than we can the similar fate which befalls some pools
winners. Cutting the top level of prize money available might help, and
should certainly be considered. Other refinements are also necessary.
The devastating effect on charitable giving, and the paltry sum awarded
directly to charities from the initial stake -- six pence in the pound
-- also demands an urgent rethink with both Camelot and the Treasury
curbing their own greed.
Similarly the top-up given through the charities board should not be
dependant on self application. The sector needs professional scrutiny
followed by a less-complex form of disbursement.
The third improvement which needs to be effected is the introduction
of more flexibility. The fact that sports and arts applications can
apply only to capital projects is too rigid a condition, the Millennium
Fund needs to reconsider its #100,000 minimum requirement --
particularly since successful supplicants need to find matching funding
-- and the National Heritage Memorial Fund -- indeed all the assorted
boards and committees -- need broader input than they can get from
commissioners with an imbalance of the lunching classes.
All that said, we then need to look at the lottery not in terms of
what's gone wrong, but what can go right and what has already done so.
The decision to throw tens of millions at opera was ill timed and
strategically inept, but that thought should be separated out from the
case for building and maintaining excellence in all art forms.
There are two things which prevent opera from becoming more popular
and neither of them has anything to do with the product. The first is
cost; and if the Royal Opera House doesn't make good its promise of
cheaper seats to give broader accessibility then it should whistle for
its money.
The other aspect of opera which puts off the unbeliever is some of the
people who do attend. People who go to opera because they love it are
fine. People who turn up because it provides yet another showcase for
the latest ensemble are frequently a pain in the neck. Those of us who
came late to opera are often tardy in our appreciation because the
audience is vastly more intimidating than the music.
And any glance through the soaring sales of albums like Essential
Opera and videos of The Three Tenors tells you that this is music which
can work its magic across all ages and classes given the chance of mass
exposure.
Yet the same arguments will rage in Scotland if Scottish Opera, whose
finances are in a state which could charitably be described as
precarious, are also successful in pulling down money from the Scottish
section of the arts kitty.
The committee handing out the lottery arts money in this neck of the
woods has boxed rather cleverer than its English counterparts. Thus far
it has handed down rather modest amounts over a wide range of art form.
A new stage here, a lighting rig there, a community project elsewhere.
And when it gets down to responding to the major applications it will
doubtless apply the litmus test that the lottery in Scotland, like the
Lord, is more inclined to bless those who also help themselves.
Unfortunately for Scottish Opera, that may translate as their being
required to bite on several long-postponed bullets such as the question
mark over the viability of an in-house orchestra and the number of
productions they can afford annually. But if they are able to put their
financial house in better order I would consider it the worst kind of
inverted snobbery to criticise any award purely on the grounds that it
is going to opera. There are hundreds of different strands which
interweave this country's cultural tapestry and while our major
institutions shouldn't expect to thrive and survive at the expense of
more modest ventures, neither should they face reverse discrimination
for aiming at world-class excellence.
Naturally enough everyone has their own shopping list of what Scotland
needs most and jobs, education, and health care will always be the
priorities. But these are not needs the lottery can or should fulfil. It
is an impoverished nation, in the spiritual sense of that word, which
relies on gambling windfalls to build and maintain the very fabric of
its society.
But equally it is a shortsighted nation which cannot see that,
properly managed, the lottery money can put the icing on all manner of
exciting cakes. And a pretty Philistine nation which cannot see that the
arts in all its guises enrich us all in the very best sense of that
word.

CARELESS talk costs votes. Mr Major warned his party 10 days ago that
they have only 94 weeks to get things right before the General Election.
They have just thrown away the first week with the muddle on share
options.
In an attempt to catch the ''fat cats'' of industry, particularly
those directors of the privatised utilities, by taxing options as
income, what do they do? They net all the ordinary moggies as well; all
those workers and managers who would like to profit from shares in the
companies that employ them.
If Mr Major allows his Chancellor to maintain this position, Tory
outrage will increase throughout the summer. The recently united party
could fracture again in the division lobbies of the Finance Bill. By
then there will be only about another 65 weeks left.
It seems inconceivable that Mr Major could let this happen. If the
Tories are about anything, it is spreading the benefits of capitalism as
wide as possible. Their goal is supposed to be a share-owning,
property-owning democracy. Their Governments have encouraged industry to
develop share-option schemes as incentives for their workers, now they
intend a tax disincentive. More than 6000 firms have established
share-option schemes in the past 10 years, benefiting more than 500,000
employees.
Their Governments have encouraged people to buy their own homes, now
the Treasury resists help for those caught in negative equity, even as
the rate of repossessions increases. How can they be trusted if they
renege on two fundamental issues like these? The answer is they can't
and they know it. A quick U-turn (in as short a time as it took the
Chancellor to announce that he will treat share options as income, not
capital gain) is the smart thing to do unless they want to pile on the
agony while Mr Tony Blair makes the best of his 94 weeks.
It is no good Mr Heseltine, in his first speech as Deputy Prime
Minister, lambasting Blair as a mere lawyer, ''able to argue on either
side of a case depending on who is retaining them''. It obviously
slipped his mind that his colleague the Chancellor is a lawyer and
therefore shares this characteristic.
Both of them should remember that they are being retained by the
British public which certainly wants the emoluments-diet ''fat cats''
reduced, but not at the expense of everybody else. Heseltine and Clarke
need to start arguing the case for those who retain them, at least for
the remaining 93 weeks.
Everything is in the perception of party leaders' actions. Mr Blair
was able to travel all the way to Australia to attend a conference of Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the bete noir of the Labour Party,
and get away with it. It is smart to establish relations with the Sun
newspaper (among others) which boasted that it won the last election for
the Prime Minister.
It was perceived as a sensible thing to do for a party leader who
wants to gain power within the next two years. If Mr Major is to use the
bonus of his leadership election victory, he has to start showing the
country what he is about and why. Statesman-like conduct on Northern
Ireland, Bosnia, or Europe is one thing, but he will be wasting what
little time he has left if he does not attend to domestic issues like
share options and homes.
Thursday's by-election at Littleborough and Saddleworth, almost a
classic area for share options and home ownership, will destroy any new
momentum obtained by Mr Major if the Tories come last behind Liberal
Democrats and Labour. In the late Geoffrey Dickens's seat, unemployment
is low and home ownership is high.
If the Tory vote rebels there it might be that Messrs Major,
Heseltine, and Clarke will wake up to the reality that has been evident
for some years now. Unless they produce a big package of good things for
this kind of voter, Mr Blair is the next incumbent of No 10.
Furthermore, until they can produce such a package, they must stop
saying and doing things that actually make such voters wince. Mr Clarke
is supposed to be one of the Government's most experienced operators and
yet he allows himself to be led up a muggers' alley by Sir Richard
Greenbury.
This was careless talk indeed. Now Mr Major had better take his
Chancellor by the hand and lead him out of that alleyway. There is an
opportunity to do so this week. Sir Richard and his inquiry team into
boardroom pay have been invited to meet Mr Clarke at the Treasury.
The muddle could be ended promptly if it is explained that there will
be a ceiling placed on share options for taxation purposes. ''Fat cats''
will be above it, and ordinary folk below it. It is not the business of
Treasury civil servants to court the Tory voter. That is the job of the
Cabinet, all of the Cabinet.
The way they have been behaving so far inclines us to think they have
been in power so long that they believe they lead a charmed life, that
they do not need to pay attention to the irritations of their
supporters. The chief perception about Mr Blair is entirely the
opposite.
This is his genius. It is recognised by his party which follows him
slavishly, convinced that he cannot be wrong-footed and that he will
lead them back to power. Mr Blair exudes a sense of awareness about the
voters' wishes and concerns and he does nothing that will nonplus them.
Get Mr Major one-to-one, and he is the same. But his Ministers keep
coming out with daft things. Remember Mr Stephen Dorrell telling us a
few months ago that we should forget about investing in our own homes?
After 40 years of being encouraged by the Tories to do so?   It is
perfectly obvious that the country is weary of accident-prone Tories,
chopping and changing, saying one thing, doing another. Perhaps the best
thing Mr Major could do for his 94 weeks is to impose not only an oath
of loyalty on his colleagues, but an oath of silence.

A GERMAN electronics and engineering group is believed to be among
bidders seeking to buy the National Engineering Laboratory, a Government
agency based in East Kilbride which employs 225 people.
The Government, which is privatising the agency, yesterday refused to
reveal the identities of those bidding to take it over, but it is
understood that a consortium headed by Siemens of Germany is among the
contenders.
A decision by the Department of Trade and Industry on the preferred
bidder for NEL, which carries out research for Government departments
and private industry, is due to be made shortly, and an announcement is
expected within the next two weeks.
The DTI and senior managers at NEL yesterday refused to discuss the
privatisation, while a spokesman at Siemens's headquarters in Munich was
unable to confirm whether it was bidding.
A DTI spokesman said: ''The DTI has received more than one bid for
both the NEL and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, which is also
being privatised, but is not able to release commercial information.''
A NEL spokesman said: ''I am not in a position to comment, but staff
were told on Friday that it is hoped an announcement of who the
preferred bidder is will be made within the next two weeks.
''Then, there would be a sale and purchase agreement which would take
a further six weeks, meaning the sale would be completed in September.''
Mr Adam Ingram, Labour MP for East Kilbride, has criticised the NEL
sell-off, claiming that the number of jobs has been deliberately reduced
in the run-up to privatisation, while the Institution of Professionals,
Managers, and Specialists union has said NEL should remain in the public
sector since it is a ''public asset''.
However, NEL management sources yesterday rejected these claims, and
said the axing of about 200 jobs over the past five years had been a
result of market conditions.
An unnamed source added: ''Research establishments, like other parts
of government, are subject to market pressure and there was no specific
plan to reduce staff prior to selling them.
''There has not been and is not enough government work to sustain us.
Five years ago, 85% of NEL's work was from the government. Now 50% is
from the government with the remaining 50% from the private sector.''
Asked whether a new owner was likely to make any further changes to
staff numbers, the source said: ''I can't comment on the plans of
bidders but the laboratories are at the right staffing size for the
workload expected for the foreseeable future.''

THE body of a missing diver was recovered from the sea off St Kilda at
the weekend.
The alarm had been raised by divers who had chartered a yacht which
was anchored in the island's Village Bay.
Coastguards in Lewis scrambled the local rescue helicopter which took
the body to hospital in Stornoway.
The victim was named as Mr Paul Wright, 36, a contracts manager, of
Morley Barn Farm, Gotham, Nottingham.
Mr Wright died while on a trip with 11 other divers to the Western
Isles on Saturday.
His father, Harry, said: ''Paul and his diving buddy had surfaced but
felt they had come up too quickly. They went back down to 15ft to
decompress, but I think they had an air problem.
''They were diving off St Kilda. The last thing I said to him was that
it is dangerous diving that far out at sea.''
Mr Wright's girlfriend, Ms Denise Lovatt, 38, of Nottingham, said:
''He was an experienced diver. He must have done around 300 dives. I am
devastated.''
Meanwhile, a search for a diver thought to have died in a disused
quarry was called off last night because specialist equipment is needed.
Police divers found no trace of his body but were only able to descend
to 150ft in Dorothea quarry at Pen-y-Groes, near Caernavon, north Wales.
A police spokesman said the lake was more than 300ft deep in the area
where the man vanished and specialist equipment was needed before such
depths could be penetrated by the searchers.
The diver was one of two from the Greater Manchester area who got into
difficulties 150ft below the surface of the lake, rated as providing one
of Britain's deepest inland dives. Only one of them surfaced.
He sought help from another diver but they found no trace of the
missing man.

THE controversial Geoff Hurst goal which put England on course for
victory over West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final should never have
been allowed, two scientists claim to have proved.
Using new techniques of computerised video tape analysis, they
concluded that the whole of the ball did not cross the goal line after
cannoning down from the underside of the crossbar.
English and German football fans have been divided for nearly 30 years
over whether or not the goal should have been allowed. It put England
3-2 ahead and they went on to win 4-2, Hurst completing a hat-trick.
Dr Ian Reid and Dr Andrew Zisserman of Oxford University's department
of engineering science spent weeks tracking the trajectory of the ball
using new advances in the field of videometrics, the science of taking
measurements from film footage.
They concluded that the ball bounced one inch behind the front edge of
the goal line. Even allowing for the widest margin of error, the
scientists say that it would have been about three-and-a-half inches
short of being a goal.
Hurst told the Sunday Times: ''The linesman gave a goal. It counted
and we won 4-2. It's as simple as that. We were the better team.''

A 53-YEAR-OLD computer expert was involved in the first of a series of
mountain incidents in the Lochaber area at the weekend.
Mr David Philips, of Hazel Grove, Stockport, was walking in Glen Etive
with his wife when he fell down the hillside.
Although his wife raised the alarm and Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team
and an RAF helicopter were scrambled, Mr Philips made his own way off
the mountain to Belford Hospital for a check-up on a slight injury.
Five minutes after Mr Philips's mishap was reported, Lochaber Mountain
Rescue Team was called out to attend another casualty.
Miss Sandra Gadd, a 26-year-old student, of Spottiswoode Street,
Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, was leading a climb known as the Vampire, in
Poldubh, Glen Nevis, when she slipped and fell.
She sustained an ankle injury and was stretchered off the hill. Miss
Gadd was taken to Belford Hospital, then transferred to Raigmore
Hospital, Inverness. Her condition was not serious.
Later on Saturday afternoon two members of a group doing a sponsored
walk up Ben Nevis sustained leg injuries when they fell near Half Way
Lochan.
Mr William Ritchie, 34, a travel clerk of East Ham, London, and Mr
Roger Darvelle, 23, an under-manager, of Beverley, Yorkshire, were
released after treatment.

A BUSINESSMAN has been found dead at his company's headquarters.
Mr Timothy King, 49, a director of Belhaven Brewery in Dunbar, East
Lothian, was found by a brewery employee around 1am on Saturday.
A Lothian and Borders Police spokesman confirmed last night that they
were not treating Mr King's death as suspicious.
The incident has shocked company staff who described Mr King, married
with three children and from Galashiels, as a happy, popular man.
Mr King, the company's corporate development chief, was found in the
brewery house by a shift worker, Mr John Hannan from Dunbar. Mr Hannan,
one of three brewery workers on night shift, said last night: ''Nobody
here can believe this. He was a very, very popular man.
''He would never pass you in the road without speaking to you. He was
a really happy, cheery sort of chap.
''I got a real shock when I found him. It's all very sad and my
thoughts go out to his family.''
Mr Hannan said Mr King's office was on the Spott Road complex where
most of the staff were based. He said the brew house in Brewery Lane
where he was found was about a mile-and-a-half away.
Belhaven Brewery is the oldest independent brewery in Scotland and was
bought out by the management for around #32m two years ago.
Last night the boss of Belhaven Brewery, Mr Stuart Ross, paid glowing
tribute to Mr King.
Mr Ross said: ''We are all absolutely shattered. I spent yesterday
with Timothy's family.
''There were no signs last week that this was about to happen. If
anything he had just returned from a week's holiday and was in a very
bullish mood.
''He was a very busy man. He was involved in the Scouts, church, and
had a lot of other interests.''
When Mr Ross led the management buy-out bid for Belhaven Brewery, Mr
King was one of the three other men involved.
Mr Ross added: ''Timothy had a major role to play in our success. That
makes what has happened even more difficult to accept.''
