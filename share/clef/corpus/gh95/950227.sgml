THE Stirlingshire village of Plean is an unlikely destination for
Scotland's premier rugby trophy. In sporting terms, the mining community
is probably better known for its Rangers supporters' bus.
But it was Plean where Stirling County, the new Scottish rugby
champions, were last night continuing their celebrations. The Stirling
players are the first team from outside the Borders or Edinburgh to win
the McEwans National League first division trophy and a few drinks were
taken at the Plean home of Kevin McKenzie, one of the club's three caps
in the recent victory over France.
As at the best rugby parties, the action spilled over to the local
pub, in this case the Plean Tavern, the home of the aforementioned True
Blue supporters club and more usually known as The Billy.
Stirling County is a new breed of Central Scotland rugby club. They
breed their own players, attracting young local talent from any and
every source. They are not one of your public school-type clubs.
The Billy in Plean is not an ideal place to engage people in
conversation about what school they went to, so enquiries of the
socio-economic profile of the Stirling County players were best kept to
asking what kind of work they did.
It is a broad range from actuary to bricklayer with sundry
agricultural types, a policeman, salesmen, and students thrown in. Gus
Turner is an exception on the school front having gone to Daniel
Stewarts but the main thing about County is that it doesn't matter.
McKenzie, whose celebrations have been reasonably curtailed because of
international commitments against Wales at Murrayfield on Saturday,
reported some satisfaction when he and Kenny Logan turned up for a
Scotland squad session in Edinburgh yesterday.
Colleagues from some of the more established clubs have not taken too
well to the rise to pre-eminence of the Stirling club in recent years.
Stewart Hamilton, the Stirling captain with the ox-like constitution
and a fondness for the odd cigar, whisky, and beer, had also taken a
break from the celebrations. He was in charge of the club's mini-rugby
section for a visit yesterday to Boroughmuir. Can it be that common
sense has struck the legendary Larkhall-born lock at the age of 39?
The chaps from Bridgehaugh are county by name but not by nature. They
are down-to-earth types, as befits the farming backgrounds from which
many of them come. Rough, even. A comparison to badgers' backsides
springs to mind, but but we would never say so. The people at Stirling
County RFC are far too friendly and hospitable and the players are far
too frightening.
When SRU president Ken Smith was called upon to present the McEwan's
first division trophy, he had to do an Oor Wullie routine. The
microphone lead was too short and didn't reach down from the grandstand
to where he was standing. Mr Smith and the Stirling officials
improvised. It must be the first time an SRU president has made a speech
from on top of an upturned dustbin.
The Sports Diary was privileged to share a celebratory Glenfiddich
with Stirling's oldest member. Donald Cameron played for Bridge of Allan
RFC when they merged with Stirling High School FP in 1946 to form the
present club.
Donald scored County's very first try and went on to become captain.
Another stout chap of farming stock, Donald is still to the fore at 82.
He said he planned to have one or two further whiskies but would
probably give the disco a miss.
* JIM BAXTER is currently making a video of his life and times along
with that cheeky chappie Chick Young. The video, imaginatively titled
Slim Jim, will include footage of the 1967 England-Scotland
international when Baxter humiliated the World Cup holders.
What a good idea, they thought, to take Slim Jim back to Wembley and
interview him at the scene of his triumph. No problem, said the Wembley
management. That'll be #1000 please.
With a combination of fierce Scottish pride and even fiercer Scottish
canniness, the video makers declined to pay, hinting that they could do
with their #1000 charge what Jim Baxter did to the England team in 1967.
The word ''stuff'' was involved.
The interview was filmed at Hampden.

Raith Rovers 0, Dundee 0
WEEK in, week out, the Baden Powells of football turn up to try to do
the good deeds for their clubs.
In the first division, Dundee's Neil McCann and Steve Crawford of
Raith Rovers inevitably seem to be the targets, with the Old Firm oft
being mentioned in connection with both.
When they appear on the same stage, there's a juicy prospect -- as was
the case in the goalless draw at Stark's Park on Saturday. Unless, of
course, they are upstaged.
If someone can use persuasive powers to lure Madame Natalie Pageaud
back from France to try again to settle in Scotland with her two
daughters -- and there will be another child in August -- then husband
Michel will not be lost to our game.
The keeper might disappear from Dundee, but at least the club would
profit handsomely if he continues to turn on the form that broke the
hearts of Rovers -- and particularly that of the aforementioned
Crawford.
Manager Jim Duffy feels the keeper's family circumstances almost
certainly will mean his departure between now and when his contract is
up next year. ''It will be a major surprise to me if he stays,'' said
Duffy.
And according to Pageaud, only the financial crisis afflicting most
clubs in France is holding him back. Duffy certainly is not. ''The
manager understands my problem,'' he said.
Pageaud and his missus look as though their only hope as far as work
in France is concerned is if the likes of Paris St Germaine or Monaco
show an interest.Step in the persuasive tongues of top league Scottish
football -- and it would probably help greatly if their French was in
good nick.
And talking of speaking, Duffy should have been in a toga at the
aftermatch press conference as he debated the battle for promotion. All
that was missing from his thoughts was ''beware the Ides of March''.
The Dundee leader reckons that between the middle and the end of next
month will sort out the men from the boys. ''There will be little change
in the next six weeks -- at least a month before the nitty gritty
starts.
''Then we will start asking how the other teams have done on the day.
At the moment we are all cutting each other's throats.''
He added: ''No matter who goes up, the top five sides in the first
division at the moment would be a credit to the premier division. I
don't think any of them would weaken that league.''
On the game itself, Duffy made passing reference to McCann and
Crawford. ''None of the so-called flair players had their best games
today.''
And considering that the teams have met four times so far this season
-- two weeks in a row when you consider last week's Scottish Cup tie --
it is easy to understand Duffy's remark of:
''It was the poorest game of the season between us, although there
were an awful lot of chances created. Too many high crosses rather than
natural, open football. We know each other too well, and I can't
complain at the result.''
Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl did not sound too disappointed either.
After all, his side may have lost up at Dens Park in early December,
but since then they have gone on a superb winning run of 10 games, which
was brought to a halt only on Saturday.
''The fact is we're still up there in the table. The fact is that we
created a lot of chances.''
Nicholl did reflect, however, that it had been a long time since his
side had failed to score.
He was right -- against Airdrie on October 8 -- a run of 21 games
which also included that Coca-Cola Cup triumph. Now, having met Dundee
two weeks on the trot, Airdrie in the league and then in the Scottish
Cup is the next double target.
And despite Dunfermline inching ahead at the top of the table, who's
to say there won't be a treble?

I HAVE read the Herald's reports and analysis of the violence at the
England v Republic of Ireland of Ireland football. It is simple. You do
not need to be an expert on football or the psychology of football
violence. It is testosterone poisoning! How many women did you see
throwing missiles and beating people?
I am so glad that it is (so far!) the oestrogen hormone that dominates

LONDON-based Robert Karlsson led a Swedish charge when he won the Open
Mediterrania in Valencia yesterday to gain his first European PGA Tour
victory.
Karlsson, who had led from start to finish, finished on a 12-under-par
aggregate of 276 to beat Sam Torrance, Spaniard Miguel-Angel Jimenez,
and fellow Swedes Jarmo Sandelin and Anders Forsbrand by three shots.
Then came Pierre Fulke, Freddie Lindgren, and Per-Ulrik Johansson on 280
to give Swedes six of the first eight places.
Torrance, playing in the last three-ball with Karlsson, had to eagle
the last to gain a share of second place. As a result, the Scot
collected nearly #20,000 which will help him as he bids for an eighth
successive Ryder Cup appearance.
0 Karlsson, who has lived in London for the past 15 months, is the
tallest player on the European Tour at 6ft 5ins and said that he was not
swinging well at the start of the week. ''Then Simon Holmes, my coach,
pointed out I was swaying into the ball and everything fell into
place,'' he said.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
276 -- R Karlsson (Sweden) 64, 69, 71, 72 (#50,000).
279 -- M-A Jimenez (Spain) 73, 69, 69, 68; J Sandelin (Sweden) 68, 71,
71, 69; S Torrance 68, 67, 71, 73; A Forsbrand (Sweden) 69, 71, 67, 72
(#19,952 each).

68, 68, 70; P-U Johansson (Sweden) 69, 71, 69, 71 (#9000 each).
Other scores included: 281 -- R McFarlane 65, 70, 75, 71; P Affleck
71, 69, 69, 72; L Westwood 68, 72, 69, 72. 282 -- D Gilford 69, 74, 72,

AFTER a stalemate in the tenth end, Stranraer's Hammy McMillan won the
Macallan Challenge at Perth yesterday with a draw to the button that
just crept into the front of the 12ft ring of the house to beat the
earlier attempt by David Smith, of Perth, that came up short.
By this stage, both teams had accumulated a total of #2000 each and,
as well as determining the overall winner, the successful draw carried
an extra bounty of #1000. However, as well as dealing with the
cash-prize pressure, both teams had to contend with melting ice, which
had made the tenth end a bit of a lottery and caused an unusually high
number of poor shots from the high-calibre players involved.
The Challenge adopted a ''skins'' format, which helped give the game
an extra attacking edge. Several times the players pulled off high-risk,
multiple takeout shots in the search for the money prizes.
Chief among them was Norman Brown, at No.3 in the McMillan team, who
successfully carried out a spectacular promotion of his own stone into
the house at the fifth end, while at the same time taking out three
Smith counters. He then repeated the fireworks at the ninth with a stone
that just slipped past two front guards before taking out its target.
Each team won three ends to accumulate their pots but in the end it
came down to sudden-death draw for the McMillan team to come out
winners.
This game was an experiment by the Curlers Association to make the
sport more attractive. Spectator seating was put up right at the edge of
the rink and both teams later theorised that it was the extra warmth by
having a large crowd so close that caused the ice to melt.

GLASGOW Tigers are close to a surprise turn-around as they strive to
complete their starting line-up for the new-look Premier League season.
Robert Nagy, mainstay for the Shawfield outfit for the past two years,
but seemingly out of the 1995 squad because of international commitments
in his native Hungary, is now strongly tipped for a return.
A fruitless search for a replacement has led to Tigers promoter
Douglas Hopes invesigating ways of flying his star rider back from the
continent to fulfil as many Sunday race dates as possible.
Glasgow have re-signed Australian Mick Powell for a campaign due to
open against Belle Vue on March 24.
Glasgow's Knockout Cup trail opens at Middlesbrough, the winners to
meet Cradley Heath. Edinburgh Monarchs have a second-round tie with
Hull. Draw:
First round: Arena Essex v Eastbourne, Ipswich v Peterborough,
Middlesbrough v Glasgow, Poole v Oxford, Sheffield v Long Eaton. Second
Round: Cradley Heath v Middlesbrough or Glasgow, Ipswich or Peterborough
v Reading, Hull v Edinburgh, Sheffield or Long Eaton v Belle Vue,

LABOUR has promised to make Stirling the key battleground in April's
unitary authority local government elections.
The current Stirling District Council has 10 Labour members and 10
Conservatives. In April elections will take place for the shadow
authority which has new boundaries and will operate in tandem with the
old council for a year before taking over.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, launching the party's
campaign manifesto, said: ''The Stirling council has been specially
carved out to favour the Conservatives. Its size and boundaries are
specially-crafted and moulded to provide a tiny gerrymandered blue patch
on the map.
''All Britain will be watching Stirling where the idea of the poll tax
was born and gerrymandering is blatant.''
He added: ''Labour's key message will be: you can't trust any Tory
promise, only Labour stands up for you.
''On tax they betrayed the Stirling voters who voted Tory in 1992 and
they will never be forgiven or trusted again. Local promises are as
suspect as promises from No 10.''
On the parliamentary front, Mr Fergus Ewing, 37, a solicitor, has been
adopted to fight the highly marginal seat of Inverness East, Nairn and
Lochaber for the SNP.
Mr Ewing, whose wife Margaret is SNP MP for Moray and whose mother
Winnie is SNP MEP for the Highlands and Islands, fought Inverness, Nairn
and Lochaber in 1992, greatly increasing the SNP's vote. Sir Russell
Johnston held on for the Liberal Democrats with 13,258, a majority of
458.
Labour's David Stewart came second with 12,800, and Mr Ewing 238 votes
behind with 12,562. The Conservative came fourth with 11,517.
Sir Russell is stepping down at the next election and his party is
expected to choose a successor as prospective candidate within the
coming weeks.
Labour is in the same position. The seat is high on both the SNP and
Labour's list of key marginals.
Mr Ewing, the SNP's vice-convener of organisation, said at his
adoption meeting in Nairn that he saw the twin threats of the closure of
the Jobs Enterprise Training Centres and the axing of Highland rail
services as proving the desperate need for Scotland to have control of
her own affairs.
He added: ''I am now ready to do the job of MP and fight for Inverness
and Scotland with the same vigour as Winnie and Margaret.
''It's no coincidence that they are both known by their first names.
That's because they regard the people not as voters but as their
friends. I hope to give a lead by following that example.''

COREY Pavin became the first US professional to win the same
tournament in successive years since Nick Price took the Western Open in
1993 and 1994 when he won the Nissan Open at Riviera here in Los Angeles
yesterday.
Pavin's final score of 67 was three better than Jay Don Blake and
Kenny Perry, the overnight leader, and was a fair guarantee that the
little Californian will be back in the US Ryder Cup team to defend the
trophy in New York in September.
''I played recently with our captain Lanny Wadkins and he told me I
had better get cracking and win some points,'' grinned Pavin, very much
the local hero as he went to college in Los Angeles.
He was at his tigerish best from the start and with three birdies in
his first seven holes established a lead which he never lost.
Perry came to grief at the 420-yard thirteenth, where he pushed a
second shot out of bounds with an iron.
Pavin has never won a major but he has totalled over $6m in his career
on this Tour and his best chance of a big title could come when the PGA
Championship is played at Riviera in early August.
David Feherty of Northern Ireland, who opened the tournament brightly
but dropped a stroke to the card in his 72 on Saturday, finished
strongly with a 69.
Feherty has played exceptionally well here, just dropping the odd shot
with short putts due perhaps to a lack of concentration, and he will now
be looking forward to improving steadily throughout the spring
tournaments in Florida. Final scores:
268 -- C Pavin 67, 66, 68, 67 ($216,000).
271 -- K Perry 70, 62, 68, 71; J D Blake 69, 67, 66, 69.
272 -- S Simpson 70, 66, 68, 68; C Stadler 67, 68, 67. 70.
273 -- J Mudd 66, 71, 69, 67.
274 -- L Wadkins 67, 72, 66, 69; J Haas 69, 70, 68, 67.
Others included: 277 -- S Elkington (Australia) 68, 72, 68, 69. 278 --
D Feherty (N Ireland) 69, 68, 72, 69; F Couples 69, 69, 68, 72. 282 -- T
Kite 71, 67, 74, 70; M Calcavecchia 73, 69, 72,68; J Daly 67, 69, 71,

COULD it be that James Traynor (The Final Say, February 20) has
unwittingly uncovered the master plan to restore our football fortunes?
Do the hitherto unrecognised visionaries of The House on the Hill have a
scheme designed to return the quality of our game to that of the days of
Baxter, Law, Johnstone et al?
The article acknowledges the fact that the teaching of football skills
at all levels is under the direction of those approved by the SFA's
Technical Dept. But it also confirms that the vast majority of those at
the top levels in our game do not have the qualifications required to
allow them to come into contact with our youngest talent.
The point was made that this would mean that those people now coaching
our senior players would be prevented from passing on their expertise to
the next generation. What an excellent idea! When we consider what is on
offer at most grounds on most weeks, would we really want more of the
same in the future?
Could it be that the regulations attached to the 'D' and 'E' licences
are the first of a range of measures to be taken which will ensure that
our youngsters are given the opportunity to develop their skills
naturally? Will the next move be for the football authorities to link
with districts to identify suitable sites for more floodlit all-weather
pitches? These can then be left open for the kids to play their small
games with their own rules without having to bother about the textbook
jargon.
They would all enjoy it, as always, and the best of them would stand
out and come to the attention of the talent spotters. The chosen few
would get the opportunity to move into the senior game. The hope is that
by the time the next generation are ready to take that step our coaching
skills have progressed enough to enable the craftsman to be recognised
as a more essential part of the team than the labourer!

Ayr United 1, Dunfermline 2
MAYBE Bert Paton, the Dunfermline manager, was right. Perhaps the
result at this time of the season is all that really matters, but the
fact remains that it is a sad day when a team can perform their duties
as poorly as Dunfermline did at the weekend, return home with maximum
points, and go clear at the head of division one in the process.
Something is not right somewhere.
It is akin to going to witness what purports to be, say, a good jazz
band, but several of the performers keep hitting bum notes, and people
excuse them because one is aware of what they are trying to do, but...
Meanwhile, the poor saps in the stands keeping digging deep for the
privilege of gazing at such untainted tedium.
A true supporter, it is often said, a real follower of a club, will be
there in his or her place through thick and thin. That's fine. Enough of
the thin, bring on the good stuff please.
Certainly entertaining fare was in short supply on Saturday's menu at
Somerset Park, where the local lot created more scoring opportunities,
but lacked personnel with the ability to punish Dunfermline for their
many lapses in defence.
Of course, Paton was miffed that his men had played so poorly. ''I was
far from happy with the performance,'' he claimed. ''I think we are a
better team than we showed out there. But the way Ayr play they make it
very difficult.''
Now there is a statement with which to conjure. ''They make it very
difficult.'' He didn't really expect anything else, did he?
With many already forming an orderly queue at pie stalls, Kenny Ward
and Stewart Petrie exchanged passes before Ward curled the ball past
Cammy Duncan for Dunfermline's opener.
After the break, United pressed forward, but their efforts at the
target were little short of embarrassing, with a much higher percentage
of their efforts going over a terracing roof. No wonder they are in such
a precarious league position.
A goal from Paul Smith after 79 minutes started an exodus of biblical
proportions from the home sector, with the scoring being completed by
Norrie McCathie, whose head got in the way of a Justin Jackson effort,
which of course, remembering Ayr's form, was going wide.
But if Ayr have not quite got it right on the field, and that is a
fact, their commercial people appear to be playing well, judging by the
list of sponsors who were thanked before the ball was set in motion.
Main sponsors, shirt, ball, the list seemed never ending. Perhaps
their back room fellows should try to arrange a goals sponsor. But if
Saturday's form is a guide, that may well prove a waste of time.
Simon Stainrod, the United manager, looked disillusioned with his lot.
''When you have the chance,'' he said, ''you have to hit the target and
see what happens. If you don't hit the target you know what will happen.
There was a time out there when I thought I was on my own.''
And on the subject of his men's poor finishing, Stainrod stated that
it was not shooting practise they required, but ''bottle.''
The senior clubs on duty in Ayrshire at the weekend now face a
nail-biting climax to their campaign, but whether both will achieve
their goals, well, that's another matter entirely.

SEEING Rowan Tolley perform took me back 30 years. In the mid-sixties
that great French exponent of white-faced solo mime, Marcel Marceau,
could fill the huge Sadler's Wells Theatre in London for two weeks and I
was always there.
Is there still an audience for this kind of entertainment? Barely. The
fistful of onlookers were lost in the tiny MacRobert Studio, but
appeared to enjoy what they saw. And Rowan Tolley is good at it. His
tall gangling figure, long limbs and fingers, and expressive face,
enhanced by white make-up, are all ideal for this ''traditional'' mime.
But to an old-timer like me it all seems so one-dimensional: when
you've seen hundreds of poor old tramps looking for cigarette butts and
hundreds of French waiters preparing for customers who never come, you
begin to realise that Marceau created too many imitators.
Today's young mime-trained actors strive to distance themselves from
these old cliches, using a wider range of movement skills, with less
dependence on the creation of illusionary objects; an involvement with
the complexity of character and inner conflicts, reflecting the tensions
of the modern world.
Of course a solo performer is limited and will always have to struggle
to attract large audiences. But if a younger generation want to giggle
at Rowan Tolley's archaic characters, who am I to deny them? As long as
they don't think that's all there is to mime.

OVER the next couple of days it will be decided whether the word
''tragedy'' should be appended to the boxing record which shows that
Britain's Nigel Benn successfully retained the World Boxing Council
super-middleweight championship on a technical knock-out in the tenth
round against American challenger Gerald McClellan at the London Arena.
Everyone is hoping and praying that McClellan will make a full
recovery after having undergone brain surgery following one of the most
gruelling fights seen anywhere in recent years.
The raw courage of both men enthralled a crowd of more than 12,000,
plus millions more watching on television, and it is certain that the
boxing public will now demand that Benn again digs deep into his
resources by having a third meeting with Brighton's Chris Eubank, the
unbeaten holder of the World Boxing Organisation's version of the title.
The British pair first met for the WBO middleweight title in
Birmingham in 1990 when Eubank stopped Benn in nine rounds. The return
was staged in Manchester in October, 1993, when both the WBO and WBC
super-middleweight crowns were at stake. This time they boxed a draw
over twelve rounds and both have managed to hold on to their respective
titles since then.
At the time, neither seemed keen on a third meeting, but now they can
demand, and will probably get, a fortune for a showdown. Eubank keeps
telling everyone he is ''simply the best'', while Benn on Saturday night
left no-one in any doubt, during his post-fight interviews, that he
considers himself the No.1.
''All you lot were geeing McClellan up -- giving it this and giving it
that,'' said the champion. ''But I knew he (McClellan) would not be able
to go the distance.
''I didn't care if he knocked me down. I was ready to go with him.
Whatever he wanted to do I was going to match him all the way. Now, you
might start believing in the Dark Destroyer -- start believing I'm the
No.1 and second to no-one.''
It was an amazing performance by Benn, who was widely expected to be
blown away by McClellan's heavy punching.
Benn did hit his crises, the first coming in the opening minutes when
the champion could not have made a worse start. He was caught by a big
right, and then blasted through the ropes, to receive a long count from
the French referee.
Benn tottered on the ring apron, and just got back in time as the
count reached nine. Fortunately, he was able to switch on the
self-survival mechanism. He rolled, ducked, and dived, managing to ride
and block McClellan's blows, but still a good many of them got through.
Astonishingly, Benn charged out from his corner at the start of the
second round to have McClellan in difficulties -- and that is the way
the fight ebbed and flowed in a fever-pitched atmosphere.
There were many times when McClellan's power seemed to be getting the
upper hand, but Benn went into the trenches, just as he had pledged. A
thumping right cross from Benn sent McClellan's gumshield flying in the
sixth. It was a big attack, yet McClellan gathered his senses and
probably took the seventh -- then Benn hit his second major crisis.
He slumped under a sustained salvo from McClellan after being trapped
in the American's corner. He crashed into the ropes and down for his
second count, which reached four before he rose to take the rest of the
mandatory eight.
Benn revived to win the ninth, before the tenth came to confound all
the predictions. A Benn bomb sent McClellan down for a seven count, and
it was almost the end. He had slipped to his knees in the previous
round, claiming a head butt, but was beckoned up by the referee.
Then came the crucial blow, a steam-hammer right upper-cut to the
chin. McClellan slid down and the fight was over.

THINK of blood sports and immediately images of greyhounds pursuing
hares -- they even have a cup competition for it, the Waterloo Cup which
is the blue riband of coursing -- and hounds hunting out foxes followed
by a posse of delinquents, of whom more later, spring to mind. What you
are not inclined to consider is football, or to be more precise junior
football, a misnomer if ever there was one.
Junior suggests something minor or younger, but there is nothing
insignificant or fresh about junior football which many regard as the
final refuge of the ageing and weary professional. It seems junior
football could also be regarded as a haven for the mentally deranged.
It is a hard environment peopled by throwbacks in many cases and even
the likes of Nigel Benn, who himself thrives in another blood sport,
boxing, which again has cause to indulge in some serious soul searching,
would think twice before entering. Much too dangerous for a professional
pugilist, even one with as big a heart as Benn.
The Scottish Junior Cup final last season between Largs Thistle, who
won 1-0, and Glenafton, became a disgraceful affair when four players
were sent off with the country looking on via live television, but while
that was an alarming flare-up, it was not an isolated incident.
Junior football always has been tough, overly macho at times and the
weekend offered up another example of the violent nature which is
inherent in this particular grade of football.
A Scottish Cup fifth-round tie between Dalry Thistle and Whitburn was
abandoned 10 minutes from the end on Saturday after the Ayrshire side
had been reduced to only six players.
The referee, a former Dalry player, had no choice but to call a halt,
but before order had been restored an official was struck on the head by
a bottle.
Just another Saturday at junior football in Ayrshire. The game doesn't
need these kind of people and the SFA ought to be calling the officials
of the junior game to account by ordering them to clean up their
environment or be put out of business, and, please, spare us the
nonsense that the senior game would suffer without the juniors. There
are already enough thugs at the top level and their numbers have to be
reduced rather than increased.
We have to stop and wonder what is happening. Why we are allowing our
standards to fall when a game of football shares weekend noteriety with
boxing, a sport in which the objective is to inflict pain and damage on
the opposition.
Gerald McLellan, like every fighter who stepped through the ropes, was
aware of the dangerous inherent in his chosen profession, but does that
make it acceptable?
I'm not sure if two men should be allowed to bludgeon one another into
unconsciousness and also hospital because the spectacle appeals to
primitive instincts and keeps the small few who control the sport rich.
We are a dreadfully sanguine lot, and that brings us back to
fox-hunting.
Soon the nation will be off racing with Cheltenham galloping to the
front of the mind and the Grand National thundering towards us also. The
bravery and raw power of the horses can be beautiful to behold, but
what, you may be asking, has National Hunt racing to do with
fox-hunting?
According to the Jockey Club, a horse must have been out with the pack
seven times before it can qualify for hunter chases -- of which there
are about 150 throughout a season -- at proper race meetings, and apart
from urging horses over fences as tall as bungalows surely fox-hunting
can be described as one of the greatest evils of this sporting world.
There are 10 registered packs in Scotland and that's a lot of people
who believe that charging through the countryside behind a pack of
baying hounds, who are on the scent of a fox, is a sport which offers a
great deal of enjoyment and satisfaction. Of course, farming and country
folk are involved, but if fox-hunting is anything it is an example of
the rich and privileged at play.
Now, this is not to suggest the rich and privileged have no
entitlement to recreation, but must they be allowed to get their kicks
through making some smaller creature suffer the chase before being
ripped and torn apart by the hounds as often happens at the end of what
the mounted creatures would declare ''a splendid and jolly good day's
sport, what?''
As the weekend's events have just highlighted there is an element of
violence in many sports, but the aim is not to kill as it is in
fox-hunting or coursing, for instance.
Only the other day Clement Freud, the silly man, told us how he had
just enjoyed a week's coursing in Southport and was not too
complimentary of the anti-brigade who generally show up whenever there
is coursing or packs about to be let loose.
Admittedly, a fair number of those who try to prevent the killing do
themselves and their cause harm by their own behaviour, which can also
be unacceptable at times, but there is nothing fundamentally wrong about
trying to prevent cruelty wherever it occurs.
The wallahs who mount up and crash through the fields no doubt will
claim it is all part of some ancient and natural order and that the
entire scene is steeped in tradition.
Sending children up chimneys is part of our history, but we don't
allow that any more. We have evolved, although if you watch ''Out With
The Hounds'' which is Wednesday night's episode of Cracking Stories on
BBC1 you will see how some people are caught in something of a time
warp.
As I watched a preview the thought occurred that maybe, just maybe, it
would be more acceptable if the packs were sent in pursuit of the thugs
who keep tarnishing the image of football.
Now that would be an interesting sport, although all of the packs in
Scotland might have to be deployed if the substitute for the fox was a
junior footballer from Ayrshire. That way the odds would be much more
reasonable.

SOUTHERN Africa had little difficulty in winning the inaugural Alfred
Dunhill Challenge when they held off Australasia 14-ll in Johannesburg
despite recording only three successes in the final series of nine
singles.
The confrontation had been billed as the Southern Hemisphere's
equivalent of the Ryder Cup, but an incident between World No.1 Nick
Price and opponent Greg Norman ensured the friendship between the two
would never be threatened.
Neither had played particularly well and with their match all square
both needed three shots to reach the sixteenth green. Price's ball was
15 feet from the flag and that of the man he succeeded as Open champion
at Turnberry last July was barely six feet closer.
Their golf had been far from spectacular, then the close friends
confused the gallery by picking up the balls and calling the hole a half
in 4. The spectators had no idea what was going on, the scorers were
just as much in the dark, but the whole thing had been pre-arranged.
Explained Nick Price, who has always been regarded as one of nature's
true gentlemen: ''Greg and I had discussed the whole situation
surrounding the tournament the previous night and decided we never want
to get into a Ryder Cup situation like the one where Paul Azinger and
Seve Ballesteros won't speak to each other. We don't think that is
necessary in golf.
''We agreed that as we both wanted the game to go all the way to the
eighteenth green there would be at least one opportunity to concede each
other putts.
''That situation arose when we played the sixteenth poorly and as we
approached the green Greg turned to me and said: 'Let's do it' -- so we
did.' ''
The Alfred Dunhill Challenge will never achieve the popularity of the
Ryder Cup if the lack of fierce competition is continued and that may be
no bad thing.
David Frost showed no such mercy to his opponent Wayne Grady in the
top singles. The South African had carded 10 birdies in 15 holes in his
first fourball last Friday and he hit Grady with another six yesterday
to win 6 and 5.
The only disappointment of a weekend of celebration for the home side
was yesterday's 3 and 1 defeat of US Open champion Ernie Els by Fiji's
Vijay Singh.
Australasia never looked like winning after a hiding on the first day,
but will point out that they were unable to field their strongest side.
* AUSTRALIAN Craig Parry won the Canon Challenge tournament in Sydney
yesterday by three strokes after matching the course record with a
seven-under-par 65 in his final round. Defending champion Peter Senior
was fifth with a closing 71. Leading scores:
275 -- C Parry 69, 69, 72, 65.
278 -- Wayne Smith 72, 68, 72, 66.
280 -- Grant Kenny 69, 68, 74, 69; Paul Moloney 75, 67, 71, 67.
281 -- Peter Senior 70, 70, 70, 71.
Other score: 285 -- Ian Garbutt (Britain) 71, 72, 70, 72.

COMMONWEALTH gold medallist Richard Corsie, after dominating the
opening 13 days of the Churchill Insurance World Indoor Bowls
Championship in Preston, saw the singles title vanish as he went down in
straight sets to England's defending champion, Andy Thomson.
For Corsie, it was bitter disappointment after the high of Saturday
when he and Alex Marshall gave Scotland their first ever win in the
pairs, beating David Bryant and Tony Allcock in a thrilling five-set
encounter.
Corsie lined up in yesterday's final as a warm favourite after his
earlier success, but he started nervously and never really got into his
stride.
Scots-born Thomson counted three shots on the opening end and added
singles on the next two for a 5-0 lead.
Corsie got off the mark at last with a single on the fourth end, and
added another single on the next. But a great conversion then saw
Thomson count the double he needed to take the set 7-2.
Corsie counted on four of the opening five ends in the second set to
take a 6-1 lead, and suddenly things began to look better for the Scot.
However, Thomson hit back and doubles over the next three ends saw him
snatch the set 7-6.
''Had I won that one things might have been different, but who
knows,'' Corsie said later.
Corsie again made a good start in the third set and led 3-1 after two
ends. But Thomson then produced the shot of the match on the next end,
springing the jack to his back bowls to count a four and move 5-3 ahead.
Thomson wrapped it all up on the next end when a double gave him the
set 7-3 and the title for the second successive year.
Corsie said: ''I can't explain how I played today -- I just couldn't
get into it.
''I had chances to add shots and couldn't, and even when heads were
against me I had good opportunities to change things and couldn't take
them.
''I'm not as disappointed at losing as I am at not playing well. I
would have been a lot happier if I had done myself justice, even if I
had lost.''
Things had been a lot happier in the Corsie corner on Saturday night
after the pairs win.
It was Corsie who produced the two shots of the match to wrap up
victory. With the scores locked at 4-4 in the deciding set, Allcock and
Bryant piled three shots around the jack on the next end.
Corsie drove with his first bowl and removed all three. Allcock took
the shot back with his last bowl, but again Corsie had the last word
with another drive, pushing his bowl off the rink, and Corsie and
Marshall did a jig of delight in the middle of the portable rink in
Preston's Guildhall.
Disappointingly, the celebrations did not continue yesterday.
However, Corsie has had a superb championship and that elusive world
record fourth singles win must surely only be delayed.
* DEFENDING champions Midlothian and last year's beaten finalists East
Lothian both won through to the second round of the CIS Insurance
Scottish Indoor bowls Cup with contrasting victories on Saturday.
Midlothian got things all their own way in an 87-52 win over
Stonehaven at Dundee, finishing ahead on three of the four rinks. East
Lothian, however, had to work hard for their 81-70 win over Edinburgh.
Auchinleck and Bainfield, two of the fancied sides, both tumbled out.
Auchinleck lost 76-74 to Paisley at the Magnum Centre in Irvine while
Bainfield's hopes of completing a cup and league double ended at Forfar
when they were edged out after an extra end 79-78 by Turriff.
The day's biggest win came at Ardrossan, where Irvine crushed
Lochwinnoch 150-50. Results:
First round -- West Lothian 86, Dundee 50; Aberdeen 80, Nithsdale 68;
Cumbernauld 79, Balbardie 71; Galleon 72, Fintry 66; Perth 107, Elgin
53; East Lothian 81, Edinburgh 70; Irvine 150, Lochwinnoch 50;
Lanarkshire 85, Garioch 67; Cowal 87, Blantyre 76; Midlothian 87,
Stonehaven 52, Arbroath 81, Whiteinch 71; Stirling 86, East Fife 64;
Turriff 79, Bainfield 78 (after extra end); Paisley 76, Auchinleck 74;
Buchan 76, Ayr 75; Headwell 105, Tweedbank 71.
* NITHSDALE, last year's beaten finalists, are safely through to the
semi-finals of the Scottish Team championship after beating Dyce 6-2 in
yesterday's quarter-final at Dundee. Other results:
Inverclyde 6, East Fife 2; Coatbridge 6, Ayr 2; Midlothian 4 (67
shots), Dundee 4 (63 shots).

COMPETITORS were treated to a rare combination of plentiful new snow,
sunshine, and little wind at both Nevis Range, where an international
entry contested the British Telemark Ski Championships on Saturday, and
at Glenshee, where the first Scottish Masters Championships were held.
Roddy Langmuir, 34, met the challenge not just by a clutch of former
British Alpine Team colleagues, but by his lack of time on alpine skis
over recent years to lift the Masters title after winning Saturday's
Giant Slalom and finishing second in yesterday's Slalom.
With more than 60 competitors, aged from 30 to 81, racing on
Glenshee's Cairnwell's, it was in the two younger age groups that the
depth of competition lay.
On Saturday, Langmuir, who retired from the British team in 1980,
proved he had lost none of his technical skills by finishing more than a
full second ahead of Alan Whyte (Edinburgh).
In yesterday's Slalom, his former British team Slalom sparring partner
David Mercer (Edinburgh) opened a gap of 1.65 seconds over Langmuir on
first run -- a margin which he increased slightly on the more demanding
technical second run to win.
As runner-up in the Slalom and Giant Slalom winner, Langmuir lifted
the Overall title from another late seventies GBR team skier Ross Blyth.
Patrick Winterton (Perth) repeated a remarkable tie-breaking win over
Kerr Blyth (Edinburgh) to retain his British Telemark Championship title
on Saturday. Exactly as last year, both skiers won their specialist
event and placed third in the other.
Results:

BOTH trainer and owner were delighted with the way in which Gary
Cahill won on Rusty Blade at Edinburgh, but the stewards were much less
happy.
They handed out an eight-day ban, from March 6 to 13, to the Irish
conditional jockey for excessive use of the whip in a thrilling finish
to the Edinburgh University Turf Club's Novices' Handicap Chase.
Rusty Blade (10-1) and Leading Prospect (4-1) were inseparable as they
battled it out, nip and tuck, from the final fence, but Cahill conjured
up a final effort from his mount to squeeze home by a neck.
Rusty Blade, a 50-1 course winner in December, jumped brilliantly
throughout, but to keep him to keep him upsides with Leading Prospect in
the race to the line Cahill hit him eight times -- two more than
regulations allow.
Trainer Peter Monteith and owner Margaret Nisbet, who had been
overjoyed by the performance of the six-year-old son of Broadsword and
full of praise for the jockey, were stunned by the severity of the
punishment.
Monteith said: ''I feel sorry for Gary, especially as he will miss the
two-day Ayr meeting. He rode the horse entirely to my instructions.
There was not a mark on him. I can assure you that Mrs Nisbet and her
husband Mark (the former secretary at Kelso) would never allow their
horse to be abused.''
He added: ''There is a thin line between excessive use of the whip and
not trying. If Gary had given up I might be facing a #1000 fine.''
It is Cahill's second offence this year. He was banned for four days
at Catterick on January 21 when winning on North Pride.
Maurice Barnes, the Penrith trainer to whom he is attached, said
yesterday: ''I feel he has been quite hard done by. He used the whip on
the forehand position, and never turned it. He was hitting the horse
down the shoulder to keep it going.''
Rusty Blade's victory ended a lean spell for Monteith, giving him his
first success since Aragon Ayr four weeks ago. It was his thirteenth
winner of the season, leaving him five adrift of Len Lungo, the current
leading Scottish trainer.
In the previous race, a two-mile handicap chase also sponsored by the
Edinburgh University Turf Club, he had seen Beldine, the 10-11
favourite, go down by five lengths to Roc Color, having led to the third
last fence.
Roc Color (6-4) and Universal Magic (7-1), winner of the National Hunt
Novices' Hurdle, gave Lambourn trainer Charlie Brooks a double on his
first visit to Edinburgh. They were both ridden by Dean Gallagher, who
also won on Diwal Dancer (4-5) in the Harcros Handicap Hurdle to
complete the third treble of his career.
Scots jockey Peter Niven had rides in six of the seven races, but only
one winner in Integrity Boy (11-4), in the Scottish Racing Club Handicap
Chase.
Len Lungo had a disappointing day. Attadale failed yet again, the 5-2
favourite trailing in second last at Haydock, and Youandi finished out
of the first three at Edinburgh.

ASHFIELD Juniors against Lochee of Dundee, a town of many junior
sides, in the fifth round of the Scottish Junior Cup.
Ashfield expected to win against the Eastern team; they didn't. They
lost 2-1, and easily. And worse as well, for two of their players were
sent off.
This was hardly expected and it may well be ill-considered. The two
players were well at fault but it must have been more difficult for
referee Cammy Melville down in Ayrshire on the same day, because he sent
off five players of Ayrshire's Dalry, against Whitburn. More, he
abandoned the game itself, and him an ex-Dalry footy player himself.
Heaven knows what he would hae done at this bad-tempered game; it
could hae been two teams sent off.
It was a bad day for junior footy. And not too shining for Ashfield
either.
Manager of Dundee's Lochee, David Martin, thought his team could win,
but regretted the collision he had with the Ashfield side and indeed the
referee. He spoke perhaps a little too clearly in a verbal spat with the
officials, and I suspect will come to regret his plain speaking.
Speaking to David and his children afterwards, I understand this, when
you have a collection of footballing dunderheads and a handful of
splendid players -- Jim McConville of Ashfield, a 21-year-old who,
despite the outcome of the match, had a splendid game with a
considerable authority and looked capable of senior states of play,
comes to mind.
David told me about his own young lads at Lochee. Talk to a a manager
of a football team and you will discover optimism -- you will also have
a group of very silly young men indeed, able to commit enough fouls and
nonsense to eschew the game itself, more's the pity.
Well, there were two lads sent off to add to the rout which occurred
in the junior game. There were not only players expelled from the field
but managers greeting at results and behaving very badly indeed.
Two sent off at this game and a penalty after Scott Cameron handled
the ball, deliberately, in the seventieth minute. Frankly I thought all
the penalties -- including the sendings-off -- were a little harsh.
After all, junior football is ever a touch exuberant.
Vibrant the Ashfield Club is, though, and ever was. I remember it
mostly for its most famous performer, Glen Daly, whose real name in fact
was Barclay Dick.
After the debacle of a game -- Paul Goodman and David Fisher scoring
for Lochee, with Eddie Lepkowski managing to grab back that penalty for
Ashfield -- I repaired to this legendary club.
I once got put out of a Communist Party party for singing The
Internationale as Glen Daly would do it. Glen Daly was a legend in the
clubs.
Tom Shields, my mucker on this blatt, often does a wee Glen Daly turn
which he describes as ''Furtz''. For years I believed this to be some
Austrian ditty which the multi-lingual Shields was wont to croon to his
kinder. I found out Shields does it for a turn at the odd wedding, like.
''Furtz a grand old team to play fur...'' belts oot the Shields larynx.
Glen Daly was the one. Ashfield was the club. I'm saying nothing. Well,
I am.
The Ashfield Club is now a pub, with a full licence and everything. It
is very smart and says it does something for the Ashfield Football Club
and maybe it does, though I doubt it does as much as the Football Club
once managed.
What I do know is that the lieges are horribly suspicious of
absolutely everybody. You would have thought me and our photographer,
Harry Turner, were out there to take depositions for the magistrates.
Well we weren't.
We were there for the football and there was precious little of it.
All we saw was play as lumpen as the crowds which witnessed it.

I WAS more than a little bemused at the newspaper headlines following
Stenhousemuir's Scottish Cup victory over Aberdeen last Saturday. As an
ardent follower of Scottish football in general, I find it astounding
that Stenhousemuir's 2-0 victory is being talked about in the same
breath as the defeat of Rangers by Berwick Rangers in the same
competition in 1967. Any individual whose knowledge of Scottish football
extends beyond the Premier League would not have been unduly surprised
at the Ochilview result.
Aberdeen are undoubtedly having one of their worst seasons for many a
long year whilst Stenhousemuir, who have never been an easy team to beat
at Ochilview, are on the crest of a wave. That Stenhousemuir should
triumph is perhaps worthy of a slight raising of the eyebrows but to
class it as a major shock is not giving credit to the Warriors who I am
sure, prior to the match, would have been reasonably confident of their
chances.
I am sure that it will not have escaped the notice of those involved
in the running of Stenhousemuir Football Club that had the majority of
clubs in Scottish Football, including Aberdeen, had their way in 1965,
they would not have been around to have embarrassed Premier League clubs
in the 1990s.
Aberdeen were one of the clubs who proposed 30 years ago that five
clubs should be expelled from the Scottish Football League for no
apparent reason apart from the fact that their faces did not fit at that
particular time. Stenhousemuir were one of those clubs but suffice to
say that Stenhousemuir's fighting qualities were as strong off the park
as they have proved to be on it and after months of legal jousting,
Stenhousemuir's league status was secured which has enabled them to
prove to teams such as Aberdeen that there's life outwith the Premier
League.
Incidentally, the forthcoming cup-tie between Stenhousemuir and
Hibernian is worthy of specific mention because it was those two teams
which took part in the first game between two Scottish senior clubs
under floodlights which was on November 7, 1951, at Stenhousemuir.
However, the home club will be hoping that the scoreline that night will
not be repeated in the forthcoming match. Hibernian triumphd by five
goals to three.

HUGH Kerr of Ayr Seaforth smashed the Scottish junior record, winning
the 400m for Britain in the under-20 match against Germany and Russia in
Erfurt, writes Doug Gillon.
Kerr, trained by Brian Whittle's coach Hugh Muir, clocked 47.69secs,
precisely the same time as Whittle ran in Birmingham at an invitation
meeting. ''Thank God I didn't run one hundredth slower,'' said Whittle
affectionately. ''I'd never have lived it down. Who does the wee b.....
think he is? He's got a great future.''
Although both men's and women's relay squads won, Marlon Devonish
(200m, 21.5) was Britain's only other individual track winner. The Scots
in the team performed creditably. Sinead Dudgeon and Alison Curbishley
were second in the women's 200 and 400m (24.39/54.33). Susan Hendry was
sixth in the latter with 56.76. Des Roache was runner-up in the 1500m
with 3-55.58, Bruce Robb was fifth in the shot (14.24m) and Ross Baillie
was fifth in the 60m hurdles with 8.15. World schools 800m champion Andy
Young was sixth with 1-55.01.

ON Saturday, February 18, 1995, Scottish rugby laid the ghost of
French domination in Paris. Our team, containing relatively new blood,
defeated France, apparently by the narrowest of margins, in the hallowed
Parc des Princes. Tres bon.
The score was officially recorded as 23 points to 21. But, this is
quite inaccurate and gives the Scots, particularly Gavin Hastings, less
credit than they are due.
According to my TV viewing, Gavin scored at least 25 tries, all
remarkably alike, giving a minimum of 125 points and a possibility of
175. We are indebted to the BBC for their recognition of Gavin's
talents, and glorious canters up the park, on this historic occasion.
Viva la BBC.

CONGRATULATIONS to Scotland on a magnificent victory over France on
Saturday!
Poor timing, then, by Derek Wyatt (coach of Richmond 10 years ago)
when he wrote in the Financial Times the same day that ''Scotland and
Ireland are more an irritation than a threat in the Five Nations,'' and
''the Five Nations championship does not need Scotland as much as
Scotland needs the Five Nations.''
Does Mr Wyatt now coach the RFU in their selection of worthwhile
opponents? I think we should be told!

MELANIE Neef lost her unbeaten 400m record on Saturday, and a
substantial cash bonus, but she learned a lesson which could take her
within reach of a medal at the World Indoor Athletics Championships next
month.
Despite a tactical blunder, which led to her being boxed in, Neef
broke the Scottish national record, clocking 52.57sec, when finishing
third at Birmingham's KP invitation meeting. With grand-slam title
winner Sally Gunnell absent and off track until June, this confirms Neef
as British No.1 indoors, and guarantees her inclusion in the UK squad
for the world event in Barcelona (March 10-12), which is to be announced
tomorrow.
The team will be considerably strengthened by the certain inclusion of
a man who also lost a long-term unbeaten record on Saturday -- Linford
Christie, who declared himself available after a sensational 60m defeat
by Darren Braithwaite.
Christie, however, in deference to a suspect back, will contest only
the 60m in Spain, declining to race the 200m in which he broke the world
record eight days ago.
City of Glasgow's Neef, in her first indoor defeat at 400m since
taking up the event 14 months ago, frustratingly missed a $500 bonus by
.07sec. She would have collected but for a mistake as the athletes broke
from their lanes. Instead of easing on to the shoulder of Commonwealth
medallist Sandie Richards, who held the inside a stride clear of Neef,
the Scot dropped in right behind her. Immediately Deon Hemmings boxed
Neef in.
All the way up the back straight Neef had to chop her stride, clipping
Richards' heels, but could find no way through. Richards won in 52.38,
with Hemmings second, in 52.46. ''I could certainly have run faster,''
said Neef. ''I've never been in that position before, and going inside
was instinctive. I won't make that mistake again.''
The American apologised for cutting Neef up. ''If I hadn't, she'd have
beaten me,'' said Hemmings. But this suggests Neef can go close to 52
seconds, which would put her in world-medal contention.
Olympic 100m champion Christie and runner-up Frankie Fredericks were
upstaged in the 60m by Braithwaite, whose previous biggest claim to fame
was dropping the baton during the sprint relay at the European
championships in Helsinki.
Christie's late change of heart about Spain, and Braithwaite's run,
proved devastating for Mike Rosswess, who had not been told the
programme had been changed to include heats. ''I'm in the best shape of
my life, but I was not allowed to run. I think I've been very shabbily
treated,'' said Rosswess, who had been the last Briton to beat Christie
before Braithwaite. ''The money meant a lot to me and the events officer
has said I will not be paid.''
The BAF executive chairman has promised to look into the matter, but
it will be cold comfort to Rosswess, for only two athletes can run in
each event in Barcelona.
For the second time in a week, John Regis was disqualified over 200m.
He was timed at 20.44, ahead of world champion Fredericks, but again had
run out of his lane.
Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj moved to eighth on the world all-time list
at 1500m with 3-36.22, and in his first run indoors, Venuste Nyongabo
clocked 7-37.82, third-fastest ever for 3000m. Event winners and leading

St Mirren 0, Airdrie 1
ST Mirren had another opening at Love Street but an old show. For the
first time they welcomed spectators to their new West Stand. It was for
travelling fans only. In more than one way a plain and practical little
victory for Airdrieonians was a game of ins and outs.
Both goalkeepers had only one save each. When they failed, until the
goal, to keep the ball out, which was also once apiece, John Martin and
Campbell Money had covering defenders to protect their nets. Together
the goalies received less attention when in the game than out of it.
After a collision in only six minutes, Airdrie's Martin toppled like a
tree. He lay still and face-down for four minutes. Later he looked none
the worse. Whatever teak props he is made of seemed totally replaced.
At about the same time into the second half, and also in close view of
the grand-looking new stand, Money had his bad moment after a hearty
foul by Steve Cooper.
Happily, the work of the St Mirren custodian was also unimpaired. He
had the soundest of appearances. Especially in the first half, he read
the intentions of Airdrie's attackers more clearly than they themselves
did.
Less lucky was St Mirren's Jim Gardner, who shared the early meeting
with Martin and was taken to hospital with concussion. His loss had no
immediate effect on the smooth style of his team-mates.
They played more football than Airdrie. Their kicking was crisper,
especially Martin Baker's. How lowly they are stuck in the table, with
only Stranraer to the south of them, was hard to fathom.
Before the game Jimmy Bone, the St Mirren manager, wanted to insist
that future opponents are beginning to worry a bit. ''The buzz from the
opposition camps is that with the quality of the players at our
disposal, St Mirren are currently in a false league position,'' he
suggested.
It is the fond argument that talent will out. But out where? Next
month's programme lists Stranraer on Saturday before St Johnstone, then
Dunfermline. They make a stirring tune for the Saints to go marching
into April. Or out of their depth.
Conceivably, the new stand might echo next season with country voices.
On Saturday it looked only one tenth occupied, although that could be a
grudging guess.
But Paisley may have prepared a theatre for a symphony orchestra and
only a couple of accordion players will turn up.
What Bone was really inviting was more patience. It became a quality
that Airdrie showed in abundance. To begin with, they looked barely
present. Even Kenny Black's attendance was hardly marked.
Hindsight offers another picture. They were just waiting. Airdrie knew
what they were about.
Jim Sandison was burdened with too much work to do. But that's how he
likes it. Paul Jack was the ever-humble, hard-working servant. Alan
Lawrence was turning the flow this way and that from either flank. Paul
Harvey added cohesion.
Last time the teams met at Love Street, Airdrie scuffed the only goal.
On Saturday, Saints scuffed it for them. Paul McIntyre dithered about a
cross from the right, and there was Andy Smith, who the injured Tommy
McIntyre. It was yet another sub's sinker from Smith.
In-and -out Saints showed their colourful quality in patches. One
problem they have is to get three, or even two, players at their best in
any one move. David Byrne had a bright, bossy debut.
But that buzz going around Stranraer Harbour this week will have a
higher pitch than the one Jimmy Bone has been hearing from opposition
camps.

THE 20-strong Scottish schools' team recorded 13 personal bests and
took three individual and two team golds, against just two golds in the
same match last year, to finish second behind England in both boys and
girls under-16 matches at the TSB Home Countries indoor international in
Birmingham yesterday.
Greenock sprinter Alan McBride won the 60m in 7.17sec. and was
runner-up in the 200m with 23.17, both personal bests, before leading
the 4x200m relay team to victory in 1-32.45.
The other two wins came in field events -- Richard McDonald (Perth)
took the triple jump with 13.53m and Gillian Black (Paisley) the high
jump with 1.64m.
The female sprinters were runners-up in both 60 and 200m, Karen Scott
(7.87) and Penny Thomson (25.97) then teaming up in the relay quartet
with Lisa Whigham and Lisa Callan to win in 1-43.41.
Among the nine Scots who gained second-place medals was 14-year-old
Kris Stewart from Berwickshire, youngest member of the team, who was
second in the 400m with 50.88. Result:
Boys: 1, England 44; 2, Scotland 34; 3, Ireland 25; 4, Wales 17.
Girls: 1, England 36; 2 equal Scotland, Ireland 25; 4, Wales 14.

IT goes without saying that Hearts manager Tommy McLean savoured the
Scottish Cup victory over Rangers last week. But, as you would expect
from a member of the McLean clan, it was not only the result which
mattered to the Tynecastle supremo.
It was as much the way the game was played which appealed to McLean
and underlined his view that the latest league set-up has to be altered.
Not at the end of the five-year spell as the clubs have agreed, but as
soon as possible.
''The present set-up is wrong and everyone is looking on and doing
nothing because the pen-pushers have stuck the clubs with this five-year
agreement. That has to be changed,'' said McLean.
''We cannot allow the system we have to continue because the game is
being ruined and some clubs -- good, ambitious clubs -- are being
ruined.
''The premier division has to be extended. We have to go to 18 clubs
and I'd even think about two divisions of 20. If we wait five years,
some of the clubs will go to the wall.''
McLean believes that the perils of relegation is causing the defensive
play in the top 10 which is destroying the game. He reckons the stakes
are now too high: ''Almost every chairman in the premier division will
tell you to a penny what relegation would cost their club.
''And, so, you get what I always call the fear factor dominating the
game. Chairmen tell managers what is at stake. Managers relay that to
the players and, suddenly, you have the scenario which brings caution
and the kind of tactics which are devised to save a game rather than win
it.
''Instead of taking a bolder attitude, the way you would if the
worries of relegation were eased, you see games being ruined.
''You can't blame players, managers, or chairmen being apprehensive
about the dangers of going down into the first division. The problems
which can follow are there for everyone to see.
''Look at St Mirren. They were in the premier division a couple of
years back. Now, they are heading into oblivion and no-one is doing
anything about it. No-one is helping them. They tried to be ambitious
and now they are in serious trouble. That kind of situation is lying in
wait for every club. The price being paid is too high.
''We have enough clubs who are full-time, and who want to remain
full-time, and all of them should be in the top flight. It should be a
condition of entry for clubs to be full-time and to have the proper
ground facilities.
''Look at it this way. Clubs presently in the first division --
Dunfermline, Dundee, Raith Rovers, Airdrie and some others -- have stuck
by a full-time policy. They are giving full employment to players but
how long can they do that if they don't get into the top 10?
''They will continue to lose money and, eventually, will release
players and the game will be the poorer for that.''
McLean is not a recent convert to the notion of bigger leagues. He has
been pursuing this idea for several years, arguing the point with his
brother, Jim, who backed the current set-up. Now, he says the Tannadice
chairman is being won round to the need for change.
The Hearts' chief, though, wants change now. He does not think we have
time to wait another year, far less the five years the league have
demanded. His message is to the point -- if change does not come quickly
then there will be club casualties.
''It does not matter to me now how we got into this mess,'' he said,
''it matters more how we get out of it. If we don't act now then some
clubs could go to the wall and a lot of footballers will go on the dole.
''Apart from the problems I have mentioned which stem from the league
set-up I don't see a lot wrong with our game. The state of football in
this country has been lambasted but when two teams go out to play each
other -- to have a real go at each other -- as Rangers and ourselves did
in the cup, then no-one can have many complaints.
''Ridding the game of the fear factor would give us more games like
that. I honestly believe that and that's why I want to see changes being
made to the structure of the leagues this summer.
''We have enough ambitious clubs around who would qualify for a
full-time league. Let's give them the chance to be a part of it.
''The sponsorship money, the television money would help them make
ends meet and, surely, they should be rewarded for standing by their
policies of full-time football for so long and at such a cost.''

SCOTLAND'S Gordon Sherry and Ireland's Padraig Harrington were pipped
by one stroke in their bid to bring home the World Amateur Team Golf
Championship from Argentina by amazing final rounds from the New Zealand
duo.
The antipodean pairing of Mark Brown and Marcus Wheelhouse prised when
they shot respective final rounds of 62 and 63 over the par-70 Mar del
Plata course.
Sherry produced a six-under-par 64 -- which earned him third place in
the individual event -- but Harrington could muster only a 71.
''I suppose we have not done badly when you take into account that in
New Zealand and Australia it is the middle of the season,'' said Sherry.

* SCOTLAND'S amateur golfers could break away from the Great Britain
and Ireland set up and go it alone for the 1996 World Amateur Team
championship. The move is being considered by the Scottish Golf Union in
the wake of the decision by their Irish counterparts to enter their own
side for the contest in the Philippines next October.
The Golfing Union of Ireland felt the total of six Irish players
selected for the 19 four-man teams since the biennial event began in
1958, was grossly disproportionate to their available talent.
The GUI were able to take the step thanks to a change by the World
Amateur Golf Council -- as a result of the break-up of the Soviet Union
-- which permits nations to enter under their own flag.
SGU president George Gormley said the prospect of a separate Scottish
team had not been dismissed.
Last year in France GB&amp;I were second to America with a team comprising
Sherry and fellow-Scot Stephen Gallacher, and Englishmen, Lee James and
Warren Bennett. It was the best result by a GB&amp;I side since 1988, when
they won the Eisenhower Trophy in Sweden.

ENGLAND'S senior women gained revenge at Lilleshall over the weekend.
Beaten 1-0 in both games last season, they enjoyed 1-0 and 3-1 wins
against the Scots.
On Saturday, a rare mistake by Susan Fraser let in Jane Sixsmith for
the only goal.
Susan MacDonald opened early with a superb chip shot yesterday, but in
the final quarter England replied from a penalty-corner strike by Karen
Brown. Tracey Robb saved a penalty but crosses from Brown and Mandy
Davis were turned in by Mandy Nichols.
* THE Scottish men's under-21 side failed to win any of their three
Tests against Ireland Under-21s over the weekend. They lost 2-0 twice
but they did manage a 2-2 draw.
In addition, Chris Anderson, of Menzieshill, and Watsonians' Michael
Leonard both sustained broken fingers.
In the drawn second Test, Graham Joyce, from Western, gave them an
early lead but Andy McBride, who plays for Grange, soon equalised. David
Hannah put Ireland ahead five minutes from time but James Burns
levelled.

GHK 12, Gala 25
THERE were no one-handed flicks a la Parc des Princes, but Gregor
Townsend, the Jekyll and Hyde of Scottish rugby, did treat the Old
Anniesland fans to some deviations from the norm as the Borderers,
efficient and dedicated, picked up two valuable points that could mean
staying in first-division rugby next season.
In his preferred club position at fly half, Townsend strolled through
the 80 minutes oozing confidence and talent and not having to lose too
much sweat.
But his one mental aberration in the first half did remind us of his
human frailties and gave GHK a score that put them unexpectedly into the
lead for a second time.
The Maroons' fly-half tried to clear from his own 22 but, like last
week's miscued effort in Paris which gave Saint Andre his second try, it
went to enemy hands.
GHK full back George Breckenridge was the recipient. He admitted later
he did not know how far out he was, but he let fly with a drop kick and
from just inside the Gala half it flew between the sticks to give his
side a 9-8 lead. A truly magnificent kick.
Imperturbable as ever, Townsend duly revealed the other side of his
dual personality and collected seven points to put Gala back into a lead
they never lost nor looked like losing.
From the start, the Maroons had the hungrier look and the positive
attitude that GHK possessed only among a few players. Gala's policy of
keeping the ball alive paid dividends.
GHK did not seem to have any cohesive ideas once they approached their
visitors' 22. Up to that territorial point the forwards thundered into
mauls and rucks, but failed to win quick ball, and by the time it had
been recycled the Border defence was reorganised.
Gala coach Peter Dods could not conceal his delight. ''Yes, you could
say I'm happy about the win. It was only our second in an away match,
but we have come so close on other occasions only to be pipped at the
end.
''What makes me really proud is that there were 15 lads out there in
maroon jerseys determined to be playing first-division rugby next
season.
''We have players fighting for several positions and it shows in the
way they are determined to keep their places.''
GHK got off to a flier with a Breckenridge penalty in the first
minute. The Gala retort was a try from Mark Moncrieff via Townsend.
Townsend and Breckenridge swopped penalties inside 20 minutes, then
the GHK full back had his glorious drop goal.
The home side's supremacy did not last long, for the Gala sevens
syndrome reappeared and they had long spells of possession culminating
in Townsend jinking over near the posts and converting on the half-time
whistle.
Townsend missed a drop goal, but Grant Farquharson and Giles Bayley
combined to put Brian Swan in. Another Breckenridge penalty was all GHK
could muster, while Moncrieff got his second try in injury time.
GHK -- G Breckenridge; G Agnew, A Glasgow, I McDiarmid, G Hawkes; S
Hirini, C Little; A Watt, M Blackie, G MacIlwham, D Mellor, K Wilson, F
Wallace, C Brown, M Wallace. Replacements -- H Bassi for Glasgow
(19min), W Malcolm for Mellor (80).
Gala -- D Changleng; M Moncrieff, G Bayley, B Swan, G Waddell; G
Townsend, G Farquharson; G Isaac, I Corcoran, A Johnson, R Hogg, G
Shepherd, M Ballantyne, N Crookes, J Amos. Replacements -- K Gray for
Ballantyne (81min).

TENNIS: By JUDY MURRAY
KEN Wood yesterday completed an unprecedented clean sweep of national
singles title when he won the Marshalls Scottish Indoor Championship at
the Gannochy Centre in Stirling. The 24-year-old from Dunfermline
confirmed his status as top home-based Scot, sweeping through five
matches for the loss of just 18 games and a first indoor success.
Among those who failed to find their best form were fourth seed Euan
McGinn, who suffered a quarter-final defeat by Scottish 16-and-under
champion Jonathan Pankhurst, and holder Jason Barnett, who struggled
past Malcolm Watt to reach the final.
Wood took the first set 6-3. Three consecutive double faults by the
young Aberdonian gifted Wood a break in the opening game of the second
and he took five of the next six games to win 6-3, 6-1.
Nicola Payne, runner-up in last week's Marshalls Scottish Junior
Championships, went one better when she took advantage of the withdrawal
of the top two seeds to lift her first national senior title. The
Tayport teenager recovered from 6-2, 5-4 down to beat Scottish No.6
Eilidh Smith in the semi-final and then out-hit Thistle's Lyndsay Reilly
6-3, 6-2. Results:
Men: Singles quarter-finals -- J Barnett (Ruthrieston) beat C McKnight
(Newlands) 6-4, 6-4: M Watt (Newlands) beat T Smith (Giffnock) 6-1, 6-1:
J Pankhurst (Kingussie) beat E McGinn (Inverness) 7-5, 6-2; K Wood
(Dunfermline) beat B Dodds (David Lloyd Club) 6-1, 6-2; Semi-finals --
Barnett beat Watt 7-5, 6-3; Wood beat Pankhurst 6-3, 6-2. Final -- Wood
beat Barnett 6-3, 6-1. Doubles Final -- K McKnight and Watt beat McGinn
and S McGuckin (Falkirk) 7-6, 6-3.
Women: Quarter-finals -- A McGarthland (Rubislaw) beat C Lavery
(Stepps) 6-2, 6-1; L Reilly (Thistle) beat R Orsi (Clarkston) 6-4, 6-2;
E Smith (St Andrews) beat J Colston (Falkirk) 6-0, 6-1; N Payne
(Tayport) wo J Taylor (Bramhall) scr. Semi-finals -- Reilly beat
McGarthland 7-5, 6-3; Payne beat Smith 2-6, 7-5, 6-3. Final -- Payne
beat Reilly 6-3, 6-2.
* ROSS Matheson's winning run in the third leg of the LTA Satellite
Circuit at Eastbourne came to an abrupt end in Saturday's semi-final.
The Scottish No.1 lost 6-0, 6-1 to third seed Thomas Johansson of
Sweden.
* THOMAS Enqvist capped his surprising run through the US Indoor
tournament in Philadelphia by upsetting holder Michael Chang 0-6, 6-4,
6-0 in yesterday's final. The 20-year-old Swede had never beaten a
top-10 opponent until his three-set triumph over world No.2 Andre Agassi
in the semis.

Edinburgh Academicals 33, Heriot's FP 3
DAVE McIvor arrived at the bar sporting a spectacular keeker sustained
at a training session long ago. He also bore a smug grin of satisfaction
at a job well done on Saturday.
His cheerful demeanour was deflated briefly on hearing that West had
pipped Watsonians, but he recovered his smile after calculating the
various points for and against totals.
McIvor's side's change in fortunes, -- from played seven, points four,
to played 12, points 14 -- speaks for itself. The flanker believes the
transition was largely down to fear.
Sure, there were one or two changes in personnel, but the main change
was in attitude. Starting with the defeat of Hawick, the Acads have won
five in a row and are almost certain to be among next season's elite
eight sides.
Heriot's, on the other hand, look destined for second divsion rugby,
and judged on Saturday's display, that is where they deserve to be.
President George Shand was a master of the understatement when he said
the Goldenacre camp was ''disappointed''.
He cited back row frailties, but in truth, man for man not a Herioter
outplayed an Academical after Kenny Milne had left the field with a dead
leg shortly before half-time.
Even before this departure, however, the visitors were on the rack,
and although the Acads had not scored the points that their superiority
deserved, it all came right in the dying minutes.
Two tries -- both converted by Brian Haysmith -- were scored in injury
time to provide a scoreline that truly reflected their dominance.
Full back Rowen Shepherd explained that the first three passes from
Kevin Troup out were deliberately short, leaving at least half the width
of the pitch for others to loop outside the contact points.
Acads' first three tries featured these wide looping runners -- Chris
Simmers and twice Ford Swanson (the second on his ''wrong'' wing) --
making the touchdown while Rob Hoole, who has given his side the genuine
open side flanker they needed, took an inside pass from Simon Burns for
the final try.
Haysmith, who contributed to the cause with a sound tactical
performance from fly half, slotted three penalties and those two late
conversions.
Peter Hewitt managed the solitary penalty for Heriot's.
Troup, newly arrived from London Scottish, delighted his skipper with
the quality of his service, the scrum half acknowledging that other
facets of his game will develop.
If Acads can retain Saturday's players and attitude, next season's
first division trophy could well end up at Raeburn Place. But how often
has this been said of Acads in the past?
Edinburgh Academicals -- R Shepherd; S Burns, C Murray, C Simmers, F
Swanson; B Haysmith, K Troup; P Haslett, R Moffitt, B Stewart, A
Adamson, J Richardson, D McIvor, M Waite, R Hoole.
Heriot's FP -- C Aitken; H Gilmour, A McRobbie, G Lawrie, P Hewitt; C
Glasgow, D Fowler; J Bryce, K Milne, S Paul, A MacDonald, C Humphries, S
Elliot, G Simpson, G Dall. Replacements -- C Turnbull for Milne (36
minutes), G Millar for Simpson (42).

Hawick 28, Stewarts Melville 10
ANY team enjoying the services of Finlay Calder is guaranteed to be
dangerous, said the Mansfield programme, adding that Stewarts Melville
could be relied on to make Hawick fight all the way.
Despite the final scoreline, the words proved prophetic, the Greens
hanging on grimly to a 15-10 lead with only 10 minutes to go. The home
fans had many anxious moments before Hawick produced 13 points in a late
flourish.
Colleges ran the ball consistently, scrum half Graeme Burns launching
wave after wave of second-half raids which they were unfortunate not to
turn into points.
Hawick set the early pace, stand off Scott Welsh converting a Brian
Renwick try and adding a penalty goal before centre Tony Stanger brushed
off a tackle to slice through for their second touchdown.
Alan Kittle bulldozed through for a try before half time to keep
Colleges in contention.
It was all to play for when full back Murray Thomson grabbed a pass
from flanker Mark Paton to gallop over and narrow the gap to five points
with 15 minutes left.
Hawick's late fight-back yielded a second try from Renwick, converted
by Welsh, who added two penalty goals for a personal tally of 13 points
virtually to ensure first-division rugby next season.
Home coaches Brian Renwick and Billy Murray admitted: ''We'll sleep
easier tonight.''
Colleges' coach Finlay Calder, who appeared briefly as a substitute in
the second half when Kittle went off, commented: ''We ran the ball at
every opportunity and gave Hawick all sorts of problems.
''That's what the game's all about. God help us all when the new
league system starts.''
Hawick -- G Oliver; C Murray, D Grant, T Stanger, G Sharp; S Welsh, K
Reid: B McDonnell, J Hay, K Scott, S Henderson, I Elliot, D Turnbull, B
Renwick, J Graham.
Stewarts Melville -- M Thomson; N Penny, P Flockhart, N Gallagher, D
Bull; F Pollock, G Burns; R McNulty, A Cadzow, A Kittle, B Gordon, W
Faulds, D Caughey, D Clark, M Paton.Referee -- C Henderson (Kelso).

WHILE Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish fight out the championship
again, and George Burley and Mark McGhee contest the wooden spoon,
Scotland's representation among Premiership managers has been maintained
with Dunoon's Stewart Houston finding himself thrust forward as the
reluctant successor to the disgraced George Graham at Arsenal.
Reluctant because, you suspect, the former Manchester United full back
-- capped by his country in the 3-1 win over Denmark in 1975 -- was
among those wiping a tear away as Graham visited the club's training
ground for an emotional farewell to his squad following his abrupt
sacking last Tuesday.
It was abrupt, but for many people belated, since Arsenal knew some
months ago that Graham had handed back #425,000 of their money, plus
interest, acquired from the agent handling the transfers of John Jensen
and Pal Lydeson to the club.
Latest revelations suggest that they were originally prepared to allow
him to continue until the end of the season, when he would receive a
pay-off of almost exactly the same amount.
It has been rather overlooked in all the excitement that two other
members of the Arsenal staff, Jensen and chief scout Steve Burtenshaw,
were also named in the newspaper investigations that eventually prompted
the football authorities into something vaguely resembling action. Their
cases are apparently still under consideration, so Jensen was in the
team that began Houston's reign as caretaker with victories over
Nottingham Forest and then, on Saturday, Crystal Palace.
Saturday's 3-0 success at Selhurst Park took Arsenal to eighth place
in the table, putting in context the supposed playing crisis over which
Graham was presiding. His final signing, the Dutchman Glenn Helder, was
outstanding again and seems destined to give the team an extra dimension
with his fast and skilful wing play.
Two goals by Chris Kiwomya also confirmed why the Arsenal board were
happy to let Graham spend so such money on players when it was always
possible he would have to leave -- they never doubted his footballing
judgment.
If Houston can continue the present run of results, starting with
Auxerre's visit to Highbury in the European Cup-winners' Cup on
Thursday, he will have impressive credentials to present when a decision
is made at the end of the season about who takes permanent control.
In the meantime, Palace's defeat has left them looking like a poor
version of Arsenal: a team under-achieving in the league who come to
life for cup-ties.
Alan Smith's side replay at home to Watford in the FA Cup on Wednesday
and meet Liverpool in the second leg of their Coca-Cola Cup semi-final
seven days later, trailing by a single goal. Saturday's defeat, however,
left them rooted in the bottom four, having played more games than most
of them above them.
Burley's Ipswich moved three points off the bottom by beating
Southampton 2-1, while McGhee's Leicester (having drawn 4-4 at Aston
Villa in midweek) lost 4-2 at Coventry; they cannot hope to survive with
such a defence.
Chelsea achieved a hugely important victory by coming from a goal down
to win 2-1 at West Ham, moving seven points above their London rivals as
well as achieving a boost before their European tie tomorrow in Bruges.
The win over Leicester was Coventry's second in succession under new
manager Ron Atkinson, pushing them almost to halfway, and Everton
maintained their momentum by defeating Manchester United 1-0 at Goodison
Park.
Duncan Ferguson's goal furthered his cult status to the extent that
manager Joe Royle said of the former Rangers striker: ''He's a legend
already. He's probably going to be the biggest thing at Everton since
Alex Young.'' (Royle himself included).
Things could have been worse for United. Blackburn's failure to win at
home to Norwich meant that their lead at the top was increased only to
three points, not five, as had seemed likely.

IT is probably not in his nature, but Andrew Gavin Hastings may well
have taken a moment or two in the aftermath of last weekend's heroic
Scottish victory at Parc des Princes to ponder the cussed nature of the
fickle finger of fate.
Five weeks ago he was too old, too slow, and so troubled by a bad back
that we wouldn't have been surprised if he had turned up at training
sessions supported by a Zimmer.
Five weeks ago, along with the rest of the Scotland set-up, he was the
object of virtually universal criticism. Five weeks ago he led Scotland
to victory over Canada at Murrayfield.
That win ended Scotland's dismal run of nine games without a win.
There was light at the end of the tunnel but we were not still not sure
whether it was the headlamps of the Oblivion Express coming thundering
down the track.
Three weeks ago Ireland were the visitors at Murrayfield and Hastings
became Scotland's most capped player. Even in these days of crowded
fixture lists, that was a singular honour but, more importantly,
Scotland won again.
Now we were virtually certain that the light at the end of the tunnel
did, indeed, lead to the sunlit uplands.
Eight days ago in Paris Hastings led his men on to the Parc des
Princes, which for 22 years had been an impregnable citadel of French
rugby to Scots.
Hastings' contribution to Scotland's win will become the stuff of
legend.
His 53-metre penalty kick turned the tide. His seventy-eighth minute
try, which just moments before he had foretold as the Scots gathered
behind their own posts awaiting Lacroix's conversion attempt, was so
adacious that as a work of fiction it would have been rejected as
fantasy.
But there was more. Hastings took the conversion from in front of the
posts. The ball soared between the uprights and we all knew that we were
living in some kind of realm of virtual reality.
Too slow? Ask France's flying flanker Laurent Cabannes. He had heard
the stories about Hastings's leaden legs. but, said Cabannes, Hastings
was a man inspired.
Too old? Ask Gregor Townsend, whose delicate pass was the precursor to
the Hastings try. Young Townsend, a strippling of 21 summers, watched
entranced as old Gavin sped into the distance.
A bad back? Well maybe it is showing the wear and tear of nine years
in his country's service and two exhausting tours with the British
Lions. But if that is what a bad back does for one then it should become
available on prescription. Immediately.
A week, they say, is a long time in politics. Five weeks in rugby has
seen Hastings rocket from zero to hero.
On Saturday he leads a re-invigorated Scotland side against Wales. A
win over the Welshmen will set up a Grand Slam showdown with England.
Last season Scotland were wooden-spoonists and Hastings broke down in
tears on TV as he recalled the hammer blow of Jon Callard's last second
penalty goal which won for England the Calcutta Cup.That was the real
Scotland you saw out there today, he said.
Whatever the remainder of this Five Nations' campaign has in store,
those of us who relish the glory of great sporting occasions will
continue to believe that this was the real Gavin Hastings we saw out
there on the Parc des Princes.
In Paris last Saturday at the after-match banquet in the
Inter-Continental Hotel I bumped into Hastings. Few people had given the
Scots an outside chance of victory. He wagged a finger and declared:''I
told you we would do it and you didn't believe me.'' Well, I don't know
about that, but in future when Hastings speaks we would all do well to
listen. Hard.

JUNIOR ROUND-UP
JOINT favourites Arthurlie were held to a 0-0 draw at Kelty in the OVD
Junior Cup despite having sustained pressure in the second half of the
game.
A winner from Willie Spence -- recently included in the junior
international pool -- took Hill o'Beath through to the quarter finals
after beating fancied Shotts Bon Accord 2-1.
A goal from veteran centre half Danny Sloan took Kilwinning Rangers
through against the sole surviving North region team Lewis United -- the
post and crossbar keeping the score respectable.
Glenafton, last season's beaten finalists, drew 1-1 with Tranent
thanks to a late equaliser from ex-Stranraer player Steve Farrell.
Surprisingly Camelon, 5-0 victors over Tayside team Downfield in the
last round, found themselves 2-1 behind to North End thanks to goals
from Ross and Cooper. However, left winger McKenzie saved their blushes
with a late equaliser to take the game to a replay.
Lochee United's young team reached the last eight despite being
reduced to 10 men. 2-0 up at half-time they held on despite a late rally
by Ashfield.
In the all-Tayside derby a second half strike by Stewart gave Tayport
the result over Carnoustie.
In the Ayrshire region, with Kilwinning and Glenafton on cup duty,
Auchinleck took advantage and moved into second place in the Western
Stagecoach league with a 4-2 victory over Winton Rovers. Billy Thomson
(2), Barry Scott and Kenny Paterson were the Talbot scorers.
Pollok went 10 points ahead in the Reebok League thanks to second half
goals from Duncan Sinclair and substitute Jim Jamieson against Glasgow
rivals Petershill.
A late winner from Davie Dougan took Cumbernauld United to the top of
the Reebok first division.
In Tayside, St Joseph's first domestic defeat of the season stopped
them going to the top of the AT &amp; T League.Scone Thistle continue to set
the pace in the second division thanks to their 5-2 win over Balbeggie.
A George Webster hat trick took Buchanhaven Hearts through to the
third round of the Campbell Construction Cup.
Longside's defeat in the league leaves Stoneywood two points in front
with four games in hand and in the first division Crombie's 6-1 victory
takes them three points clear of Hermes. Results:

Selkirk 17, Kelso 13
SELKIRK almost pressed the self-destruct button on Saturday. They
tripped over hurdles that were not there in beating Kelso in a match
that kept Selkirk in the running for the second division title.
Selkirk's forwards had by the far the better of the lineout, their
scrummage made the only home try with a strike against the head, and
they were far more adept at winning breakdown ball.
Selkirk have now to beat only one of their two remaining opponents --
Wigtownshire (away) and Corstorphine (at Philiphaugh) -- to ensure they
join Kelso in the second division of the slimmed-down championship next
season.
Selkirk should have been comfortably clear at the interval. Instead,
they led by only 6-3, with two penalty goals by Rodney Pow sandwiching
one by Aitchison.
Pow and Aitchison traded penalty goals in the third quarter before Pow
made a telling break. The full back scythed through from halfway, kicked
ahead, and forced a scrum five, and though Selkirk failed to exploit it
they quickly made amends. The home forwards shunted a tight-head strike
for Martin Powley, and swift passing to the narrow right side let David
Hunter over.
Pow soon added his fourth penalty goal and Selkirk seemed safe at
17-6. In the final minutes, Gordon Laing's break put Lang over for a try
that Aitchison converted, but Kelso had nothing else to give. Teams:
Selkirk -- R L Pow; D W Hunter, S A Nichol, M A Jaffray, D Hulme; J
Smith, A Lindores; J R S McColm, M Powley, C R Guntley, K D McConnell, D
C S Cameron, P Minto, W Gentleman, S McKenzie.
Kelso -- G J Aitchison; S D Lang, G Laing, R Laing, J Thomson; S Tait,
P S Dunkley; J Ramage, K Thomson, D Howlett, J Jeffrey, S Forsyth, S
Bennet, K Hendry, C Millar. Replacement -- A Thomson for Jeffrey
(39min).
Referee -- J L Bacigalupo (Edinburgh Wanderers).
* SELKIRK are to make their first appearance in the Middlesex Sevens
at Twickenham on Saturday, May 13.

Currie 28, Jed-Forest 32
''IF only in previous matches we had opened up the game as we did on
Saturday, instead of playing for safety, we would not be in the position
we are in now.''
Jed president Lawrence Armstrong was not despondent yesterday as he
set to cleaning the Riverside clubhouse, his usual Sunday morning chore.
''It was a great game yesterday. We should have had it sewn up in the
first half when we were romping away with it, but the injury to Ross
Murrow at half-time appeared to disrupt our efforts and Currie came back
into the game.''
Murrow was taken to hospital and it is suspected he has a chipped
vertebra and could be off for the rest of the season.
There was no despondency at Malleny Park either. ''We have the
strongest squad we have ever had but we have had so many defeats this
season by a few points,'' commented Bruce McNaughton, match secretary at
Currie.
The teams scored three tries each, with Edinburgh's Ally Donaldson
contributing 13 points from three penalties and two conversions, and
Chris Richards' efforts bringing him 19 points for Jed from four
penalties, one conversion and a try.
Mark Blair, Graham Ellis and David Wilson scored tries for Currie,
while Kevin Amos and Ronnie Kirkpatrick were the other try scorers for
Jed, who led 20-7 at the interval.Gregor McKechnie's dropped goal three
minutes from the end clinched the points.
Jed have two games to play and their eight points could be increased
to 12 if they win those matches. Presently in eighth and last place for
the new first division are Heriot's with 12 points and two games left.
Teams:
Currie -- D. Wilson; M. Tomkin, M. Te Whaiti, M. Plumb, C. Robertson;
A. Donaldson, D. Rogerson; P. Calder, G. Ellis, C. Boyd, R. Johnston, G.
Hamilton, B. Ward, M. Blair, S. Hardle.
Jedforest -- C. Richards; M. Yale, H. Hogg, A. Douglas, K. Amos; G.
Scott, G. Renwick; N. McIlaray, K. Barrie, R. Johnstone, R. Murrow, C.
Hynd, K. Armstrong, R. Kirkpatrick, C. Brown.
Referee -- C. Muir (Langholm).

HE is a long way from being the most troubled manager in the
Highlands, but Huntly's Steve Paterson has been given some cause for
concern as his club approaches the important last few weeks of the
season.
The champions now have three defenders out with long-term injuries
after Arthur Murphy was stretchered off in the Jarlaw Aberdeenshire Cup
semi-final at Fraserburgh, and even their impressive squad is being
stretched.
A move into the transfer market before the mid-March deadline is now a
distinct possibility for Paterson, who saw his side surrender a one-goal
lead in the semi, which ensured a replay this Saturday.
Eddie Copland had put the cup-holders ahad after three minutes, but
Henry Michie earned a deserved draw for Fraserburgh in the second half.
By then Huntly had already lost Murphy with a recurrence of the knee
injury which kept him out of action earlier this month.
If Huntly do reach the final to keep alive the possibility of a second
successive treble they will have to overcome Cove Rangers, who beat
Buckie Thistle 2-1. A Mike Beattie strike and an Alan Leslie penalty put
Cove through, while Buckie, who had Ian Mathieson red-carded, got a
consolation from Dave Galbraith.
Lossiemouth are only 90 minutes away from ending a 35-year wait for
silverware after cruising through to the final of the McEwan's North
Cup. A Scott Patterson double helped brush aside Forres 4-0 in the
semi-final, with Iain Stewart and Steve Gerrard also on the mark.
Fort William and Brora Rangers must replay the other semi-final after
finishing goal-less.
In the Highland League, Deveronvale created the surprise scoreline of
the day with a 4-0 win at Elgin City. Player-manager Kevin Bremner got
two, while Murray Ritchie and Ross MacLean were also on target.
A Kevin Will double in the last six minutes gave Keith a 2-0 win at
home to Wick Academy.

IT was after Saturday's match between Watsonians and West of Scotland
that Scott Hastings, now recalled to the international team, said: ''Now
that, if ever there was one, would have benefited from a sin bin. We
have to look at it in Scotland -- there were players today who needed to
be ejected for a while, without being sent off.''
To explain: there had been a good deal of bad temper in an otherwise
competitive match, and no neutral would have said that the match had
been brimful of flowing rugby. Frayed tempers got the better of players
in two good teams, and the level of stomping on unprotected bodies was
unacceptable. Some of the mouthing off was childish.
On one memorable occasion, two players were having a set to in the
middle of the field when Fraser Stott, who had his usual pugnacious
game, came running in from 10 yards swinging wildly. He missed with his
punch, promptly fell on his backside, but incited the large Watsonian
crowd. ''Send him off'' was the cry.
Thankfully, Bobby Clark, the referee, did no such thing, instead
delivering a stern lecture to Stott who had quite obviously lost the
place, and if there had been a yellow card handy then Stott might have
received one.
Scott Hastings' point, and I agree with him, was that much of the
prattish aggro in the fixture could have been removed early on if some
of those daft enough to persist with skullduggery had been despatched to
a sin bin for a period to cool off. The game wasn't dirty, no one
deserved to be sent off, but some of the players would have done well to
sit quietly in a dark room and, as the song says: ''Think again''.
Many involved in rugby, including Jim Telfer, the SRU Director of
Rugby, and Ken Smith, the President, argue against sin bins, feeling
that they merely give the referee the easy option of not sending a
player off.
There are those, though, like Scott Hastings and the selector Colin
Fisher who would be prepared to see them try it out in Scotland. Fisher
yesterday cited a recent Wigan rugby league match where, due to the
explosiveness of the encounter, three players found themselves sitting
in seclusion within the first 10 minutes. That was enough to see the
game's more fiery aspects quelled.
One of the more obvious elements of Saturday's game, and many a game
in Scotland, is the negligent raking of opponents by forwards, more in
frustration than in any real attempt to ''activate'' the ball.
In our club rugby, the touch judges come from the clubs taking part,
and they have no jurisdiction to help the referee. Any time they might
be needed, of course, would be situations where foul play had occurred.
It was Hugh Campbell, the much respected former Glasgow forward and
coach, who yesterday called for neutral touch judges in the top league.
Allan Hosie, the former international referee, says that could create
problems. ''We simply don't have the numbers of top class referees to
start bringing in neutral touch judges,'' he said. ''But it's something
that will, of course, be looked at.''
Touch judges are being trained by the SRU, but they said yesterday
that they believe that the experiments so far in allowing touch judges
to attract the attention of referees have been unsuccessful.
Let me pin myself firmly to the mast and say that anything that helps
rugby remain physical but clean cannot be a bad thing. There will always
be occasions when players lose tempers, but, through the combination of
bad luck or lack of skill, end up looking very silly while failing to
cause any real harm. I see no harm in sin bins and neutral touch judges.
I think we should look at both.

Melrose 23, Dundee HSFP 20
IT was a day for celebrations at the Greenyards. Then along came these
guys from Dundee, determined to spoil the party.
And they nearly did with a penalty goal attempt by Jon Newton two
minutes into injury time, which sailed tantalisingly wide.
It is easy to attach labels like ''plucky'' and ''game'' in a
patronising sort of way to teams like Dundee High School FP, but there
is far more to them than that. With each season there is an improvement
in the way they perform, and no matter where they end up next term, it
is hard to imagine them being away from the top flight for long.
As for Melrose, the faces of the coaching staff said it all -- this
once invincible outfit is not firing on all cylinders at the moment.
But to the celebrations. An injury to Robbie Brown meant Ken McLeish
came off the bench to play in his 300th game for Melrose, then it was
another milestone for cheeky chappie Gary Parker.
The remarkable Parker has broken the club points-scoring record set by
David Chisholm in 1968. With his six penalty goals in this game, Parker
has now scored 1099 points for his club in less than 100 games.
He was typically modest: ''It's not just me. These guys win the
penalties and I just try and pop them over.''
And win penalties they did as pressure led to Dundee erring on many
occasions within the Parker range. Melrose, though, did not rely just on
his kicking and added a fine try by Graham Shiel after Ian Leighton had
come like a bullet from full back and made miles of ground.
Dundee made a roaring start to both halves and were rewarded with
tries from the excellent Tom Smith and the pacy wing man John Jardine,
who skinned Derek Bain on his way to the line. Newton converted both.
The stand-off added two penalty goals to his tally but could not quite
slot the one that really mattered. Dundee heads are high, though, and
there is a determination allied to their pleasing open approach to the
game of rugby. More of the same elsewhere, please.
Melrose -- I S Leighton; D C Bain, R N C Brown, A G Shiel, G A Parker;
C M Chalmers, B W Redpath; I Cornwall, S Scott, R E Craig, K J McLeish,
E M Simpson, G W Weir, S A Aitken, A J Kerr.
Dundee HS FP -- P R Rouse; M A Cousin, D R Hamilton, S Longstaff, J R

Stirling County 13, Boroughmuir 9
THE champagne came later but Stirling's championship winning
performance was hammered into shape on the hard anvil of resolute
defence and a blunt refusal to accept second best.
Champions are fashioned from sides which win games when defeat is
staring them full in the face, and for long periods at Bridgehaugh on
Saturday Stirling were eyeball to eyeball with the spectre of having to
take their title challenge down the road awhile yet.
Understandably, this was a nervous and diffident Stirling. No
derring-do, but guts in abundance as Boroughmuir piled on the pressure
in the second half and Stirling were forced to tackle, tackle and tackle
again.
Stirling's points all came in the first half. Thereafter, it was a
case of hanging in there for grim death and championship glory. The home
side were whitewashed on the touchlines and survived on meagre rations
elsewhere as well.
But the only try of the game was Stirling's. The scorer was right
winger Gus Turner but the hallmark was stamped on it by his counterpart
on the left flank, Kenny Logan.
Logan's run, to borrow a phrase from the cinematograph, came on the
stroke of half-time as he shot from deep within his own half to scatter
the Boroughmuir defenders like ninepins. Logan scythed between Lineen
and Stark before setting Jim Brough off on a sprint for the line. The
Stirling No.8 didn't quite have the legs to make it himself but he
passed out right to Turner and the wing-threequarter was over at the
corner flag.
Stirling had an early opportunity to take the lead when stand-off Mark
McKenzie put a penalty attempt wide of the posts. In the eleventh minute
Boroughmuir's Bryan Easson made no such mistake when he slotted home a
simple effort from just outside the 22.
After 25 minutes, Logan put Stirling back on level terms with a
penalty goal after Peter Wright -- again in storming form -- was
adjudged to have late-tackled the Stirling stand-off. Three minutes
later Easson put 'Muir back in front after Stirling conceded a line-out
penalty.
Mark McKenzie and Logan each failed with shots at goal before Logan
equalised with a penalty effort. As he lined up for the kick white smoke
billowed from the car-park hamburger stand. It was a smokey omen for
Logan.
A couple of minutes later he was off on the careering run which ended
in Turner's try. He converted for good measure and at the interval
Stirling were 13-6 in front.
In the second half Boroughmuir launched wave after wave of attacks on
the home line. It was to the great credit of Stirling that they were
able to keep 'Muir at bay.
After 54 minutes Easson kicked his third penalty goal and, on the
touchlines, Stirling supporters were sending out for fresh nails to
bite, but Boroughmuir could not penetrate the brave County defence, and
there was an audible sigh of relief from the touchlines as Eddie Murray
blew for no-side.
Later, an immensely relieved Stirling coach Brian Edwards admitted
that he had been on tenterhooks throughout. ''It wasn't the greatest of
games but it did the business. To scrape through against Boroughmuir and
then to have West beat Watsonians away from home is quite unbelievable.
''It wasn't as if we went out and grabbed it on today's performance
but the championship is sweet nevertheless. This is what it is going to
be like next season with the eight-team leagues. Every game is going to
be a nail-biter like this.''
Brother Henry, Boroughmuir's coach, was disappointed that his side had
not capitalised on their chances but he was delighted that the win had
been kept in the family.

Watsonians 12, West of Scotland 13
SPORT needs honest men. Let's start with David Barrett. He dropped a
goal, deep into injury time, which may well prove to be the spark which
keeps his club in the first division next season and certainly
extinguished the championship hopes of Watsonians.
What did he have to say? ''I played so badly for the rest of the game
I was only trying to atone. In fact, I was not all that sure of what the
score was and, just before the ball reached me, I sneaked a glance at
the board to see if a drop goal was any use.''
Next up Watsonians coach Peter Gallagher. ''We deserved to lose. There
were more mistakes made in that match than in all the others this season
put together.''
Completing the trio, referee Bobby Clark, who hangs up his whistle at
the end of this season. ''I did not have a good game. Today convinced me
it is time to retire.''
Clark was being a bit hard on himself -- there were players on both
sides who should be thinking hard about their conduct and a couple who
were extremely lucky to stay on the field. When the participants lose
their self-discipline referees have an almost impossible task.
This was a match which should only be shown to children if they are
refusing to go to bed. The decision of Gavin Hastings to sit it out
shows what good judgement he has.
Yet it started quite brightly. Brother Scott was all set to celebrate
his return to the international team and was involved early doors.
Watsonians were awarded a penalty in front of the posts. West awaited
the kicker who never came. Instead, Jamie Weston took the tap, Duncan
Hodge his pass, and John Kerr scooted over in the corner. Hodge's
conversion was majestic.
This is going to be good, we thought, quite mistakenly. The West pack
took command, rumbling upfield like a platoon of tanks. But though they
laid seige to the home line they plainly lacked any kind of guile and
some brave defending kept them at bay.
Barrett missed a couple of penalties before the unfortunate Hodge
dropped the ball behind his own line and John Shaw only had to fall on
it for the try. The conversion by Barrett tied up the score, and a later
penalty by him gave the visitors a narrow interval lead.
Hodge scorned two penalties chances after the interval, but Watsonians
were starting to believe they might just win the points. In the day's
best back movement, Scott Hastings straightened the line, Fergus
Henderson entered it and Kerr sped away for his second try.
Nothing much else happened until the Barrett goal, sweetly executed.
Colin Mair, the West coach, told me he believes his side will survive
by beating Edinbugh Academicals and Currie in their final two fixtures.
I hope they do, the game requires a strong presence in their part of the
country.
Where had Gavin gone? Off to the hospital with his friend and
ex-Scotland colleague Roger Baird, who had broken a wrist playing for a
minor team. That's the measure of the man.
Watsonians -- F M Henderson; G Inglis, S Hastings, A R Garry, J A
Kerr; D W Hodge, J Weston; M Stanaway, D Henderson, J Fayres, M B
Rudkin, C M Campbell, C Mathers, G Hannah, J D MacDonald.
West of Scotland -- A Williamson; M Craig, D R McKee, C Hart, A
Hogarth; D N Barrett, F H Stott; P Wong, G Bulloch, A S Crear, S
Campbell, G Perrett, D McVey, J Lonergan, J Shaw.

AFTER a 35-minute delay to the kick-off -- the referee and linesmen
were late arrivals -- Rangers wasted no time in piling up the goals
yesterday in a Scottish Youth League match with Alloa Athletic at Hannah
Park, Shotts.
Leading 7-0 at half-time, the Ibrox team scored eight more in the
second half for a 15-0 win. The goals came from McGinty (4), McShane
(4), Nicoll (2), Kerr, Shields, Nicholson, Dair, and Douglas.
* BOLTON manager Bruce Rioch pointed an accusing finger at Derby
striker Marco Gabbiadini following the challenge that left Simon Coleman
with a broken left leg.
The former Derby centre-half was stretchered off in the eleventh
minute after a crunching tackle by Gabbiadini, and Rioch confirmed
afterwards: ''Simon has a fractured leg and he will be operated on this
evening.''
Rioch exchanged words with Gabbiadini and he admitted: ''I said to him
that when he puts his head on the pillow tonight and every night after
that he will think about Simon Coleman and what happened out there''.
Derby won the match with two late goals from Dean Yates and Lee Mills
after Jason McAteer had put Bolton into the lead after 50 seconds
following a blunder by on-loan keeper Russell Hoult.
* CHELSEA'S European Cup-winners' Cup quarter-final first leg match
against Club Brugge tomorrow night could be postponed -- because the
Belgian club's pitch is waterlogged.

STRANGE the way life pans out sometimes. Josephine Higgins used to
pull her toddler son, John, around the shops in Wishaw by a rope tied to
his pedal car, but these days the 19-year-old prodigy of the
professional snooker circuit travels in much more stylish fashion.
He gets around now in a shiny new Mercedes.
The car, worth #27,000, was given to him along with a cheque for
#60,000 after he had beaten the doyen, Steve Davis, in the final of the
Sweater Shop International open in Bournemouth last week.
The triumph carried Higgins' earnings since having turned professional
over the #300,000 mark, and he is only in his third year on the big-time
circuit. It is impossible to say how much he will amass by the time he
is regarded as one of the senior members of the tour, but much will
depend on how he is managed and promoted.
The corporate world clamours for snooker champions and astute,
professional packaging can bring in handsome sums of money for
fresh-faced young heroes like Higgins, although he has already made it
clear he believes there should be more to life than bank balances.
Higgins was with Team Sweater Shop, an 11-player stable under the
rigid rule of Ian Doyle, but he split from the organisation which is
fronted by the world's No.1 and world champion, Stephen Hendry, because
he was uncomfortable with the regime.
''He's a sensitive boy,'' his mother said, ''and he's very deep. But
he is determined, he always has been. I remember when he and his older
brother Jason wanted money to go to the snooker club to practice and
sometimes I didn't have enough to give them.
''I would say to them, 'sorry boys, but you can't go tonight,' and
Jason would accept that and do something else. John was different. He
would just stand there, looking and waiting, until eventually I had to
give him the money.''
Therein may lie the crucial difference between John and 23-year-old
Jason, who also played snooker and was tipped by many as a future
champion. But the daily grind may have worn him down, and he walked away
from it preferring instead to go to watch Celtic play.
John's determination, and that quality commonly known in the sporting
world as ''bottle'' made him labour at the tables and reach out for a
share of the spoils.
The trappings of success are being delivered rapidly now that he has
won three ranking tournaments stretching from Australia to Bournemouth,
and finished runner-up in two others. From a lowly ranking of 51, the
former St Aidan's High School pupil has risen to No.12 in the world
rankings, but a more revealing picture materialises with closer scrutiny
of the statistics.
Higgins' record over the last year is second only to that of Hendry,
and if the official rankings were drawn from matches over a one-year
period instead of two, as is the current fashion, the little boy from
Wishaw would be No.2 in the world. He is the in-form player and the one
most likely to knock Hendry from his perch. Even Doyle admits his
champion is under severe threat from a player who defected.
''There is no question that Higgins is a genuine and real threat to
Hendry,'' Doyle said through the haze of cigarette smoke which hangs
over him constantly. ''Basically, a clash of personalities caused our
split after three years, but it would be wrong to underplay Higgins'
ability because of that.
''Believe me, he has a very, very tough mentality. Tons of bottle, and
he is the biggest threat to Hendry's dominance in six or seven years.''
His mother and his dad, John, who has taken over the business side of
the career ''for the time being'' are well aware of their son's
single-mindedness. When he decides on a course of action, he becomes
focused and does what is required to achieve his ends.
His mother could trace her boy's determination back to the first hours
of his existence, hours which were traumatic and dramatic. ''When I was
giving birth, I was given pethidine, but it had an affect on John's
breathing and he was not given much hope of surviving,'' said Josephine.
''His dad was told that the baby would not survive the night, but he
did, and apart from the usual ailments and accidents which all children
suffer, he has never had a problem since. He was always such a
determined laddie. But I shouldn't be telling you all that, he'll be
embarrassed.''
If anything embarrasses Higgins, it is the thought of being regarded
as some kind of celebrity, a sporting superstar. He likes to spend money
on good clothes, but he is equally comfortable in jeans and T-shirt
which help him blend in rather than stand out. Even the Merc is parked
behind the family Mondeo.
''A star? Me? I don't think so,'' he says. ''Besides, my brothers,
Jason and Joseph, wouldn't let me get carried away. They'd slap me down
quickly enough. I still have the same circle of friends and I still do
things I always did before I started to win on the professional circuit.
''I might go to the cinema with my girlfriend, Denise, or stay at home
and watch television, but much of my time is taken up by travelling and
practising, which can be five or six hours a day.
''I suppose, though, that I will have to be careful where I go now
because I am getting more exposure, and maybe some people might want to
give me a hard time. I was walking through Glasgow and some people were
looking at me the way I would look at Paul McStay or Ally McCoist if I
passed one of them in the street. It was strange.''
Already, since his split with Doyle, he has been approached by various
agents, but he is happy enough with the money on the table and stressed:
''I don't want to give anyone 20% of my winnings from the table.''
His father, who was an electrician and a Motherwell fringe player in
the time of St John, has given up his work and now travels with John to
tournaments, looking after his needs and talking him through any
difficult times. Both will be in Thailand next week for another ranking
tournament in which the world's top 16 will be competing, and they will
have their eyes on Higgins.
''He is not the hit man any more,'' Doyle said. ''He has become one of
the main targets and that is something new he will have to live with.''
Higgins shrugs his shoulders and smiles. ''I don't mind,'' he says.
''I know it will be tougher to stay where I am now in snooker, but I
believe I will handle the pressures.
''In fact, I love playing in front of the television cameras and an
audience. It doesn't seem to bother me, I'm comfortable with it,
although I sometimes feel a bit nervous when I first walk out in front
of everyone, and maybe again at the end if I am about to win. Sometimes,
at that stage, I can feel my arm tighten or even twitch a little.''
He would be a strange creature indeed if he had no nervous reaction to
top-level snooker, especially the world championship which will be
played in Sheffield in April. There is nothing quite like the intensity
of the atmosphere of The Crucible, a sporting arena in which reputations
can be enhanced or broken beyond repair. It is a place in which only the
bravest survive, and Higgins intends to prove he has what it takes to
claim the big one.
Of course, he may have to overcome fellow Scots Alan McManus and
Hendry, but he feels he is ready to become the best. ''I want that title
and I want to be No.1 in the world,'' he said. ''I believe I will be.''
He doesn't offer that as a threat or a boast. That isn't his style.
Coming from Higgins, it is a declaration of intent and one which Hendry,
who has great respect for his former stablemate, will take seriously.
''I used to practise with Stephen and I learned a lot from him,''
Higgins pointed out. ''He is the best, the best ever along with Steve
Davis, and I felt that if I had stayed in the same stable I would have
been in his shadow. People might still have been referring to me as his
practice partner.''
Having broken away he looks like a champion in waiting, but to
Josephine Higgins, he will always be ''one of my boys.''

AT the end of the day, as footballers and managers like to say, it's
all about results. Here are some for them to ponder.
At the start of season 1990-91, there were 38 senior teams in
Scotland. Of those managers, only five are still in the same job -- Alex
Miller, Allan McGraw, John Lambie, Jim Jefferies, and Alex McAnespie.
Ten clubs are on to their third manager since then, and in six cases
their fourth -- hardly a recommendation for long-term job security and
the quiet life.
This year has got off to a frantic start. First it was Willie Miller's
often forecast departure from Aberdeen to be followed last week by
George Graham's sacking by Arsenal. Some recent events have cast a
shadow over managers and their motives, but one man whose integrity
shines through is Iain Munro, manager of Hamilton Accies.
He has experienced the hard times himself. Sacked after a year as
manager at Dunfermline, he headed for Dundee. His team was six points
ahead in the league, but disagreements developed when, as Munro says, a
chairman arrived who wanted to interfere in what he sees as the job of
the manager. The choice of players is the manager's, he believes. Once
again he was out of a job.
Munro is scathing about the influx of ego trippers to football and the
increasing political overtones. ''People are buying up clubs because
doing so is a great platform to promote yourself. There was a day when
fans knew the names of the players, possibly the managers, but hardly
ever the directors.'' Now they're as likely to know the thoughts of the
boards.
But since the bad old days, things have been going well for Munro.
''It's good to have the opportunity to see things through. I was not at
the other clubs long enough to get a proper structure, but at Hamilton,
I've had two years to get things organised.''
There's a new chairman in David Campbell, and Munro finds him a fair
man to deal with. So much so that he recently turned down the
opportunity of a job in Cyprus so that he could see things through where
he is.
''Of course, the chairman could decide to sack me tomorrow, but at
least I would know it was for the right reasons, not just a whim, and
after he had considered everything that I had done.''
There's plenty to be proud of at a club where money is not plentiful.
A new stadium is planned, and Munro has brought on a squad of young
players. There are 24 who have played in the first team, and only five
of them are over 25. Recently, when Allan Ferguson, the regular first
team goalkeeper, was injured, there was a 15-year-old substitute on the
bench -- career opportunities come earlier than usual in Lanarkshire.
''What many people don't realise is the amount of time managers put in
at work,'' says Munro. ''I work 70 hours a week, and I am always on
call. In fact the only time I'm off duty is if I'm on holiday. Of course
the manager gets the blame if things go wrong, but there are so many
variables.''
''People often ask me what kind of manager I would like to be, and I
always say a lucky one. Because there is so much luck in it. You can
have been a good player yourself, you can have a good knowledge of the
game, and you can have good players and still not get the breaks. The
one thing you can't control are the results.''
Another area that he would like to see better controlled is the way in
which youngsters are brought on. Scots have big hearts and there's no
lack of passion, but instead of practising, boys are encouraged to play
games and to compete rather than learn the skills which will hold them
in good stead for the future.
''At Hamilton, we tell our boys that we cannot make them rich, but we
can provide them with a platform. You can teach them good habits and
professionalism and then it's up to them.''
Munro is not in the same mould as some of the managers who jump up and
down at the side of the pitch during a game. ''I believe it's harder to
absorb the pressure, but afterwards it's altogether different in the
dressing room. That's the place to sort things out. I've even had fights
there but afterwards it's all over and we all know where we stand.''
While providing a platform for his players, Munro is also providing a
platform for himself. I suspect, that happy as he is in Hamilton, if the
opportunity came to take his talents to a bigger stage, he wouldn't say
no as he did to Cyprus.

BELGIUM will mount an unprecedented security operation to deal with
threatened violence from neo-Nazi elements at tomorrow night's European
Cup-winners' Cup quarter-final tie between Club Brugge and Chelsea.
The first indications that the worst fears of a country may be
realised came over the weekend when 10 English supporters were deported
for minor drink-related incidents.
Already police have discovered around 800 forged tickets, which were
printed in England. These are for a part of the Olympiastadion
designated for Belgian fans.
An exchange scheme has been hastily arranged, but new tickets will
only be issued by Brugge to supporters who can speak Dutch.
There will be close co-operation between police in this country and in
Belgium to monitor supporters departing at Dover and at the French and
Dutch borders.
The memory of the Heysel tragedy is still vivid there, and a Belgian
police spokesman said last night: ''The scenes at Chelsea's recent game
with Millwall and in Dublin have forewarned us and will not be tolerated
here. We are fully prepared for any actions the English may take and are
confident of controlling them.''
* PROPOSALS to make major changes in the rules of the game will be put
before the International Board in April, FIFA secretary general Sepp
Blatter has announced.
These concern a time-out lasting two minutes in each half for both
coaches, and kick-ins to replace throw-ins.
Blatter said that experiments in the Liga Paolista in Brazil and also
in lower grades in Belgium and Hungary had convinced FIFA that they
would improve the game. However, he revealed that players may be given
the option of throwing or kicking the ball into play.
Having two referees to control a match and creating a pool of
professional referees are subjects also on his immediate agenda.
''It is our intention to gather together a pool of talented young
referees, who will be responsible for all international games,'' he
said. ''These will be recruited through recommendations from each
national association.''
* DESPITE allegations of fraud made against him, Ramon Mendoza has
been re-elected president of Real Madrid, but it was by the narrowest of
margins -- just 690 votes ahead of his nearest rival.
The election campaigns of the three candidates cost a total of #3.5m
at a club now approximately #30m in debt.
* THE giants of Europe are currently gearing up for next season by
targeting their next highly-expensive purchases.
Juventus, runaway leaders in Serie A, want the Dutch midfielder Aron
Winter (Lazio), who is valued at #5m. This could be offset by the sale
of Roberto Baggio, whose #9m price tag is not putting Barcelona off.
Internazionale's new owner, Massimo Moratti, has declared an interest
in Barca's Bulgarian striker, Hristo Stoichkov. Rivals AC Milan, who
could fail to qualify for Europe unless they win the Champions' Cup,
want Sampdoria's Attilio Lombardo to regenerate their attack.
* PELE, Brazil's sport's minister, has advocated allowing wives and
children into matches free of charge as a mean of reducing violence.
* ROBERT McKaay, the 19-year-old Vitesse Arnhem striker who has been
linked with Rangers, underlined his rising status when listed for the
first time as one of Holland's substitutes in last week's friendly
against Portugal.
* PORTO beat newly-promoted Uniao de Leiria 2-0 away on Saturday to
open a four-point lead at the top of the Portuguese first division.
Leiria ended the match with nine players after referee Jorge Coroada
sent off defenders Jose Crespo, for fouling Russian striker Sergei Yuran
in the seventy-fifth minute, and Leonel Morais in the closing minutes of
the match.
Porto now head the table with 39 points, while Lisbon rivals Benfica
and Sporting share second place with 35. Sporting have a match in hand.
* A KEEPER for northern Portuguese side Pico de Regalados died on the
pitch as he was warming up for a match on Saturday.
Lusa said Albino Silva Ribeiro, 31, was dead when he reached hospital
in the northern city of Braga after collapsing on the field minutes
before the match against Panolense.
Eyewitnesses said Ribeiro was facing a series of warm-up shots when he
failed to make a save and collapsed against the net. The cause of death
was not immediately known.

St Johnstone 3, Stranraer 0
ST Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock may have been openly critical about
the general condition of Scottish football in midweek, but his faith
must surely have been partially restored on Saturday by the performance
of 21-year-old striker Kevin Twaddle.
Signed earlier this season from Dunbar United, Twaddle scored one
goal, created another and generally tormented the Stranraer defence as
Saints confirmed their position as fringe contenders in the first
division promotion race.
Despite Twaddle's contribution, Sturrock was reluctant to single the
player out for individual praise afterwards, preferring instead to
commend the collective efforts of his team, who are now unbeaten in
seven league games. ''I thought they showed a superb level of
professionalism and commitment,'' enthused Sturrock.
Teams:
ST JOHNSTONE -- Main, Cherry, McAuley, Irons, Weir, McGowne(correct),
Scott, Ramsey, Twaddle, O'Boyle, Davenport. Substitutes -- Curran,
Wright. Reserve goalkeeper -- Robertson.
STRANRAER -- Ross, Hughes, Duncan, Gallagher, Brannigan, Howard,
Sloan, Grant, Walker, Callaghan, McLean. Substitutes -- Reilly,
McCaffrey. Reserve goalkeeper -- Duffy.
Referee -- A W Waddell (Edinburgh).

Hamilton 0, Clydebank 1
CLYDEBANK deservedly claimed the points which eased considerably their
relegation worries, especially with the three teams beneath them all
losing.
The heavy pitch ensured it would never be an exciting spectacle, and
as Bankies coach Brian Wright admitted after the match: ''A mistake was
always likely to settle it.''
That mistake came from Hamilton's Jim Sherry when, with just nine
minutes to play, the full back felt he had to make contact with a cross
from Jim Grady with Steve Jack at his back, but only succeeded in
steering the ball past his own keeper.
Hamilton manager Iain Munro added: ''That goal summed it all up for us
and the game. We're very disappointed.''
Certainly, after a bright start when Hamilton went close with efforts
from Raymond McStay and John McQuade, it was the visitors who dominated
proceedings. Ken Eadie and Grady were always a handful for the home
defence with first-half efforts by the Bankies' strike-force bringing
out excellent saves from Allan Ferguson.
Clydebank kept up the pressure in the second half with the crosses by
Gary Bowman on the left wing creating problems. From one of the winger's
crosses, Eadie sent in a flashing header which Ferguson somehow managed
to tip round a post.
Just when it looked as though the third 0-0 draw between these sides
was on the cards, there came that tragic blunder by Sherry which enabled
Clydebank to record two away wins in a row.

THE #9200m Glaxo bid for Wellcome is running into potential problems
after the US Federal Trade Commission asked both British companies for
more information under the stipulations of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
It is believed that the FTC is concerned over the possible breaching
of anti-trust regulations with the products involved being for the
treatment of migraine with the 311C drug and Panorex which is used in
the case of colorectal cancer.
Glaxo said that it will co-operate fully with the FTC but that it is
not possible at present to say whether it will affect the timetable of
the offer with the first closing date of March 8.
It added that such requests for information are not uncommon in
transactions of this type and size.
However, it is unlikely to delay the offer going unconditional on that
date given that the Wellcome Foundation, with 40% of the pharmaceuticals
company, is already pledged to accept the Glaxo offer unless there is a
higher counter offer.
That may be complicated this morning after the Barings crisis.
Not only is the bank a co-adviser with Morgan Stanley to Wellcome but
any significant stock market reversal could affect the decisions of both
existing Wellcome shareholders and the thinking of any potential white
knight, particularly one armed with plenty of cash.
Wellcome chairman John Robb yesterday expressed his confidence in the
Barings team which has promised to continue to work fully in the
defence.
As there is no underwriting involved in the defence with no new shares
being issued, the parent bank's problems are not relevant.
It is understood that Mr Robb would be furious if it were to be
suggested that a successful Wellcome defence came about through the
actions of regulators in either the US or in Brussels where the EU
decision should be made known this week.
It is suggested that while there has been a silence in recent days,
talks may well be continuing with potential friendly bidders prepared to
put forward a higher offer. But that will probably not be announced
until very close to March 8 as it would throw away a tactical advantage
and also allow Glaxo to be given confidential information about
Wellcome's trading position which at present it lacks.
As the share price at 1011p is more or less in line with the value of
the Glaxo bid at 1029p, unless there is a counter-offer, Wellcome will
almost certainly fall into the hands of Glaxo chairman Sir Richard
Sykes.

ONE reason for Germany's superior industrial performance compared with
Britain is the longer-term view its companies can take which encourages
them to pursue a well-defined strategy backed by heavy and continuing
capital investment.
They can do this because their shareholders and bankers are equally
prepared to take the long view in their relationship with companies.
In Britain the system is biased towards encouraging short-term
performance which encourages a deal-based corporate culture rather than
investment for the long term.
This country's stop-go economic track record with rapidly changing
inflation and interest rates also puts industrialists off investing more
than they have to.
Even now companies are demanding rates of return on new investment
commensurate with far higher levels of inflation than are generally
expected because they do not believe that inflation will not take off
again in coming years.
Only time can change this attitude but there is a new initiative afoot
to encourage better relations between shareholders and the companies
they own. A group of leading executives and fund managers led Paul
Myners, chairman of the fund manager Gartmore, have got together to
produce a report on how this could be done, with the moral and financial
support of the President of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine.
''If the UK is to continue to meet the rising expectations of its
people then the relationship has to move from one often characterised as
a stand-off between companies and their owners to one which exhibits the
characteristics of a long-term working partnership,'' said Mr Myners.
The main conclusion is that there should be much greater two-way
communication between boards and institutional shareholders. The group
suggests that boards and shareholders have regular briefing sessions
where the company outlines its strategy, including investment and
research and development plans while shareholders should articulate what
they are looking for in their investment.
Such meetings should not just be confined to the chief executive and
finance director but include divisional heads and executives from
overseas operations so that a broader view of the company is obtained.
The problem with this is that directors are fearful of the stock
market's reaction to the implication of a possible rights issue down the
line to finance investment and are worried about the strict rules about
dissemination of information which are part of the drive against insider
dealing. They also fear competitors will gain a useful insight into
their thinking. So most companies remain wary.
This attitude is unfortunate because unless the company is open their
shares may not be correctly valued. If they are undervalued then they
are more vulnerable to a bid. In fact, there is nothing which irritates
institutions more than the way companies pull an exciting story out of
the hat when they are fighting off a bid. If the market had known
earlier the bid might never have materialised.
It is also suggested that dividend policy be more specifically related
to the achievement of objectives. The ''progressive dividend policy''
that so many companies profess to follow is just too vague. However,
companies do not believe they would invest more if they reduced dividend
growth.
Fund managers complain that they are under constant pressure from
pension fund trustees to deliver performance, often on a quarterly basis
which clearly militates against taking the long view. Beating the
indices may be satisfying but is not necessarily appropriate for a fund
which has such long-term liabilities as pension finance.
Trying to beat the indices may imply taking a degree of risk which is
inappropriate. Anyway performing better than average over timescales
measured in decades is virtually impossible.
In this context the pressure for short-term performance makes no
sense. Companies have other complaints about fund managers and the
trustees they work for which could be resolved through better
communication.
''We want a better understanding of shareholder anxieties and concerns
and more openness,'' was one typical comment. ''All we get is a feeling
of hot and cold without knowing why.''
Yet institutions all profess to want closer relations with the
companies in which they invest. What they really prefer is one-to-one
meetings but companies say institutions do not prepare for such meetings
adequately. Often they find that they have not even read the latest
annual report. Generally companies who also have American shareholders
say that they are more professional than their UK counterparts.
There is clearly fault on both sides but the need for better
communication is at least recognised. The problem is overcoming mutual
distrust, though some of the largest companies and institutional
investors have made progress.
Generally, however, this is slow despite a variety of initiatives of
which the latest report is only the most recent. Too many funds opt for
the easy way out of simply selling the shares rather than trying to
influence management.
The nature of the equity market here means that fund managers will
regularly face the temptation of selling share stakes to predators. The
theory is that they will be more supportive of managements under threat
if they are familiar with the company and its ambitions.
However, when presented with a bid which may value the company at a
premium to its perceived worth, long-cultivated relationships can be
thrown out of the window for the sake of a quick gain. Indeed the
manager may have little option to accept to avoid being accused of
dereliction of duty.
The answer, which is much easier to state than to achieve, is to
provide enough information to ensure no valuation gap emerges for a
bidder to exploit.
Fund managers may find they get little support from their trustees for
refusing a bid which apparently fully values a company because the
trustees themselves are likely to be company directors wearing a
different hat but still embedded in the culture of the deal.
The report urges institutional bodies and those concerned with
corporate governance to put the proposals in their codes of behaviour.
But changing attitudes will be a lengthy process.

IN a quiet week for economic statistics money supply and credit
figures from the Bank of England will be studied to gauge the trend in
consumer spending, which appears to be holding up better than retail
sales.
Figures for the narrow measure of the money supply, M0, due today, are
expected to show a rise of 0.4% in February and a decline in the annual
rate from 6.5% to 6.3%.
This is still well above the upper limit of the 0%-4% monitoring
range, but narrow money growth has been decelarating as retail sales
growth has slowed and interest rates have picked up.
Retail sales fell away sharply in January after a bountiful Christmas
in the High Street, and the narrow money figures will give the first
clue to the trend thereafter.
Consumer credit figures, due on Friday, relate to January. Net credit
was exceptionally strong in December at #865m and a slowdown is likely
to have taken place in January.
But with consumer spending apparently holding up better than expected
the decline may be modest. James Capel's Adam Cole is forecasting #700m.
The pound has been in the wars this month, and this is likely to be
reflected in a small fall in the reserves, due on Thursday, of $50m.
TODAY -- M0 (February).
TOMORROW -- Major British banking groups' mortgage lending (January).
WEDNESDAY -- None announced.
THURSDAY -- Official reserves (February).
FRIDAY -- Credit figures (January).

THIS week is perhaps not quite as frenetic as the last one in terms of
company results but there are still some rich pickings in store,
including a continuation of the bank reporting season.
Today it is the turn of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank and its UK
Midland Bank subsidiary -- the Abbey National mortgage lending and
banking group follows on Thursday.
HSBC is expected to unveil group profits above the #3000m level but
question remarks remain over Midland. Some analysts consider that there
could be #400m decline in profitability due to poorer treasury dealing,
though there will be a #65m windfall gain on the sale of shares in
venture capital group 3i.
But other market sector analysts believe a fall in bad-debt provisions
at Midland will lift its contribution from #844m to around #1000m. The
dividend is expected to be in the 26.5p-27.5p range compared with 25.3p
last time.
Tomorrow, Perth-based General Accident displays its wares, following
in the footsteps of Guardian Royal Exchange and Royal, both of whom
reported bumper profits.
Market forecasts for General Accident range from #405m to #430m
against #294.9m for the previous year with dividend expectations of
between 28.8p and 29p, up from 27.5p.

THE capital of the so-called Pollok Free State, a gathering of tents,
treehouses and totem-poles, may be spared the chainsaw's cut if Wimpey
alters the planned route of the M77.
The construction company says it can avoid the protesters' camp by
moving an exit route. However, it has not yet been decided whether this
strategy will be adopted.
Wimpey site agent Ron Fraser explained that the company's contract
allowed for a certain amount of adaption.
But the news will not impress pupils from Bellarmine High School, who
have vowed to strike today unless they are allowed a daily two-hour
break to support the Pollok protesters.
Louise Hewitt, a 15-year-old pupil, made her announcement on stage in
George Square on Saturday before 1500 protesters, gathered from around
Britain, for what was a friendly five-mile march to Pollok.
She said: ''The whole school will be on strike till we get what we
want, which is two hours off per day to fight for our rights and to
protest the building of the M77.''
The illegal march, which contravened the Civic Government (Scotland)
Act, enjoyed a party atmosphere along the route, with only one arrest.
Police said a report on the march would be sent to the
procurator-fiscal.

FILM director Jack Clayton -- whose masterpieces include Room at the
Top and The Great Gatsby -- has died at the age of 73.
Members of his family were with Mr Clayton at Wexham Park Hospital in
Slough, Berkshire, when he died yesterday after a short illness.
Film director Michael Winner said Mr Clayton developed heart and liver
problems.
''There is no question England has lost one of its great creative
geniuses,'' Mr Winner said.
Clayton will be best remembered for the 1958 ground-breaking film Room
at the Top and its examination of female sexuality and class.
The film won two Oscars and was nominated for best picture.
Most recent of his films was The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne in
1987, which starred Maggie Smith and Bob Hoskins.
Mr Winner said: ''Jack was a very close friend of mine. He was outside
the normal director both as a talent and as a human being. He was an
exception.
''Jack was the most gentle, quiet, wonderful man. He was a meticulous
craftsman with enormous heart and sensitivity.''

Hearts 1, Celtic 1
MAYBE it was just another example of Sod's Law, but one of the worst
games of the year produced the goal of the season from the unlikeliest
source.
Willie Jamieson, who has scored a few goals in his time but is better
known as a staunch defender, delivered the finest 30-yard shot of his
life. The ball travelled like a guided missile all the way to the top
right-hand corner of the net and gave a game of dreary mediocrity one of
the year's finest moments.
The man himself seemed as astonished as everyone else at Tynecastle.
For a player approaching 32, who has been through most of the good and
bad bits of the Scottish professional scene, it was a wonderful
experience and he was suitably thrilled. He did not, however, enter into
a lengthy, egotistical description of how he deliberately took aim and
sent in a glorious volley. ''I just decided to hit it,'' was his more
prosaic summation.
He reckoned the Hearts supporters, when they saw who had been
presented with the ball that far out, were shouting: 'Don't hit it,''
and also suggested that Celtic manager Tommy Burns probably shouted:
''Hit it,'' safe in the knowledge that Jamieson had more chance of
hitting Gorgie Road than the net.
''When the ball came to me I chested it down and would normally have
lobbed it over their defence in the hope that one of our strikers could
nip in at the back,'' added Jamieson, ''but it bounced a bit near me so
I just hit it.''
His strike came one minute from the end, at a point when Hearts'
forwards were about as threatening as a toothless terrier and Celtic,
who had been the better side all the way, seemed assured of one of their
rare three-point afternoons.
It should be emphasised that Celtic were not good, just better than
Hearts. They had scored a fine goal of their own, through Phil
O'Donnell, but did very little else to worry a Hearts defence in which
Craig Levein was sound. In fact, Celtic's best players were also at the
back, where Tony Mowbray played really well and Brian O'Neil, but for a
couple of errors, was once again excellent.
O'Donnell had his best game for a while, but that was overdue. The
#1.7m midfielder has been pretty anonymous in recent weeks, and not just
because he has not been scoring goals. His last score before Saturday
was in September, a long time ago for a player with his eye on goal, but
he admitted he would have been more worried if he had not been in the
right place to get chances.
''I have missed quite a few, but at least I have been getting into
scoring positions,'' he said. ''However, I have been hitting the keeper
with them. My form has been up and down and I have been working hard to
get a bit more consistent. Niggling injuries have been the biggest
problem.''
He pointed out that all the Parkhead players are frustrated at the run
of draws this season -- this was their sixteenth -- but still believes
that second spot in the table is within their reach. At the moment,
Celtic lie in fourth place, five points behind second-top Motherwell,
but O'Donnell, not surprisingly, reckons Celtic will get into a winning
groove and have time enough to make up the ground.
O'Donnell's goal, early in the second half, was a well struck
left-foot volley that gave Craig Nelson no chance, and nothing much
happened from then until Willie Jamieson stepped in.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns said: ''Somebody up there doesn't like us.
It is not the first time we have had a win snatched from us this season.
When I saw the ball go to big Willie I thought: no problem. But then as
good a goal as you could wish to see flies in.''
Five players were booked, Levein and Scott Leitch of Hearts, as well
as Celic's O'Donnell, O'Neil and Tosh McKinlay, who could have been
fortunate not to get a red card for a blatant body-check on Thomas.
Maybe the absence of John Robertson and Jim Bett was too much for
Hearts but, whatever the reason, they were a dreary disappointment after
their win over Rangers earlier in the week.

Dundee United 2,
Partick Thistle 0
EASY-to-listen-to Jim McInally spent Saturday afternoon helping point
Dundee United further along the escape route from the premier division's
relegation zone -- then followed up his physical exertions with a
scathing verbal attack on the top-10 format.
Both Falkirk, beaten by United four days earlier, and Partick Thistle,
who were on the receiving end of a 2-0 weekend defeat at Tannadice, were
cited by the ex-Scotland midfielder as prime examples of a system ready
to burst at the seams under the pressures of fighting for existence at
the top level.
Stated the vastly experienced McInally: ''Among the clubs currently
involved in the battle against the drop, those with most to lose are the
Particks and Falkirks of this world. If relegated, those two just might
go part-time.
''Where does that leave the players at those clubs? After all, we are
talking about people's livelihoods. That is the reason why there is so
much pressure attached to every single game nowadays.
''Our two latest fixtures have brought the whole thing home to me. The
tension in our own dressing room has been thick enough to cut with a
knife, and that is at a club which would be unlikely to give up
full-time football if relegated. So what must it be like elsewhere?
''As long as I have been at Tannadice, the accent has been on passing
the ball and making things as entertaining as possible for supporters
who have appreciated what we have tried to offer them.
''We would love to still be offering them that kind of quality, but it
is simply not possible with all of the fear that goes on in the Premier
League these days.
''Frankly, it is horrible to play in. The league as it stands is a
farce, and in my opinion the quicker they adopt a 16-club Premier
Division the better it will be for everyone involved in the game -- and
especially the supporters.''
Saturday's Tayside ''farce'' all but turned into a ''tragedy'' for
McInally himself, as he survived a late career threatening challenge by
Jags defender Alan Dinnie, an over-the-ball tackle for which Dinnie was
rightly shown the red card.
However, after it was all over 31-year-old McInally offered similarly
experienced Dinnie some semblance of an excuse for his action, pointing
out: ''He must be wary of going into such tackles after having in the
past had his own career threatened by a similar challenge.
''Maybe he thought I might do the same to him. Therefore I accept he
was probably trying to protect himself. I was lucky, as no real damage
was done. I saw the whole thing coming, but did not have the sense to
pull out of the tackle.''
As it was, Dinnie's late departure lost John Lambie's battlers their
last chance of salvaging something from an afternoon which had started
so promisingly for them.
Their weather-enforced, three-week sidelining looked to have had a
therapeutic affect in terms of their early enthusiasm, an enthusiasm
which had hosts United at a loss to respond throughout the opening half.
In fact, had it not been for exceptional goalkeeping by Irishman
Kelham O'Hanlon, a Partick front line led brilliantly by Rod McDonald
would have made a deserved first half breakthrough.
As luck would have it, Thistle failed to make their territorial
advantage pay -- and subsequently paid the price in full when Craig
Brewster grabbed a controversial opener three minutes into the second
period, scrambling home from point blank range with a visiting defence
waiting in vain on a foul being called on Dave Hannah for a handling
offence.
Despite that setback, the Firhill outfit did contrive yet another
gilt-edged opportunity to level the scores, only for O'Hanlon to deny
them yet again with a truly memorable deflection to safety of a Wayne
Foster bullet.
Disappointingly, Partick's discipline tended to evaporate the longer
the contest progressed, culminating in cautions for Tommy Turner and Rod
McDonald for dissent, and for skipper Albert Craig for a completely
necessary incident with home defender Gordan Petric.
In the end, Dinnie's banishment to the dressing room was followed by
an injury time clincher for Dundee United's Brazilian striker Sergio,
who celebrated his first goal for his new employers from six yards
range.

THIRD DIVISION
THE third division promotion race may effectively have been reduced to
five clubs after Saturday's results. The top three all won while East
Stirlingshire and Montrose have games in hand.
Cowdenbeath are now three wins behind second placed Ross County after
a 3-1 home defeat by Alloa.
Strikes by Danny Diver and Barry Moffat put Alloa two up in the first
five minutes. Cowdenbeath hit back through Craig Winter before the
break.
Hopes of a Fife comeback suffered a blow when Graeme Soutar was sent
off, but it was only in the final minute that Neil Bennett made Alloa's
win secure.
A severe test of Albion Rovers' revival under Jim Crease was a trip to
leaders Forfar. It seems Rovers are not yet ready to take on the world,
as David Bingham struck after only four minutes. Sandy Ross, Paul
Hannigan and Alan Morgan made it four for Forfar.
However, second bottom Arbroath do seem to be a different proposition
under John Brogan. They gave Montrose a goal of a start but Steve Tosh
and Lee Gardiner turned it around and a Scott double completed a 4-1
scoreline.
Ross County had to fight hard at Hampden, where Kevin McGoldrick gave
Queen's Park a first half lead. A Brian Grant penalty tied the score and
Robbie Williamson hit the winner in the final minute.
East Stirlingshire showed plenty of resilience in a six goal thriller
at Inverness. Charlie Christie, Paul McKenzie and Christie again each
put Caley into the lead but 'Shire hit three equalisers through Dwyer,
Lee and Geraghty.

SECOND DIVISION:
DO not believe stories that major English clubs have given up on
Scotland as a source of recruitment. Morton manager Allan McGraw knows
otherwise.
The crowd of 2754 at Cappielow on Saturday included scouts from a
number of English clubs as well as representatives of our own Premier
Division. They saw Morton beat Stenhousemuir 1-0 in a showpiece contest
between the second division's top two clubs.
But the message from McGraw is: ''Hands off my players -- meantime.''
By general consent, Morton are the best football side in the division
but they do not always convert their superiority into goals. You need to
score only one more goal than the other lot but McGraw was not happy
with his players' reluctance to make the win secure with a second goal.
It was in first half injury time that Marko Rajamaki scored the only
goal. Alan Mahood had started the move and Lilley's lob may well have
gone in but the Finn made sure.
This difficult fixture always looked like a trap for Stenhousemuir
after their cup exploits, but it would be unfair to suppose that Terry
Christie's players had their minds on other things, and Morton deserve
full credit for their win.
Dumbarton missed the chance to go top on goal difference when they
were held to a draw at Brechin in a game which did not deserve to be
goalless. It was the same result at Berwick, where the home side's Tony
Robinson was sent off on his debut. The Borderers needed a brilliant
display by keeper Neil Young to deny East Fife.
Duncan Campbell rounded the keeper to give Queen of the South the
first half lead at Stirling but Albion hit back through Ian McInnes.
Clyde had to weather an early storm before Jim Thomson put them ahead
against Meadowbank. Shots by Ian Nisbet and Martin O'Neil had them
coasting and substitute Jamie McCarron added a fourth before Jason Young
hit a consolation.

Aberdeen 0, Motherwell 2
THE mixture of delight and despondency was clear to see after Alex
McLeish's Motherwell had dumped Aberdeen back into the relegation zone
with a two-goal victory at Pittodrie.
McLeish was delighted to secure three points towards a place in Europe
and happy that his early morning ''paranoia attack'' about swopping
Steve Kirk and Paul McGrillen to bring in Eddie May had been
unwarranted.
But he was despondent to see the team to which he was devoted for 17
years in such disarray, to see the fans pouring out of the ground long
before the final whistle, and to hear those who remained chanting for
the board, and, in particular, chairman Ian Donald, to be sacked.
Roy Aitken now has just 10 games to instil the missing vital ''spark''
in his Aberdeen players and secure enough points to ensure that next
season they play in the premier division, but they will face Celtic on
Sunday without Theo Snelders, who was sent off.
A blunder by Gary Smith gave Motherwell their opening goal in less
than four minutes. Jamie Dolan fired in a low, hard cross from the right
and Smith failed to control it. As the ball bounced away from him, Alex
Burns pounced to fire it low past Snelders.
Aitken might then have expected his players to be fired into action,
but the confidence which they found briefly to defeat Rangers disappears
when they are faced with lesser names. Only Stephen Glass, fighting to
claim a regular first-team place, emerged with any credit.
There were chances for Billy Dodds and Duncan Shearer, but Motherwell
defended well, with May proving his worth by filling the left-back slot
extremely well. At half-time he moved into midfield when Rab Shannon
replaced Shaun McSkimming, who had suffered a hamstring injury.
With 20 minutes to go Aitken decided to replace Shearer, one of
several ineffective players on the day, with top-scoring reserve striker
Scott Thomson, a decision that brought boos from the crowd.
In 76 minutes, Ray McKinnon found himself with a scoring opportunity
in front of goal but decided to slip the ball to Dodds, whose
frustration was obvious as he watched it skim outside a post.
Aberdeen's game ended six minutes later, when Snelders came out of his
box to fell Dougie Arnott, who had zipped through the defence to pick up
a long John Philliben pass. Snelders was sent off, and McKinnon was
taken off for substitute keeper Michael Watt.
From the free kick Paul Lambert back-heeled to Rab McKinnon, who
blasted a 20-yard shot through the disorganised Aberdeen wall and into
the back of the net, the cue for Dons' fans to stream out of the ground.
''We lacked that extra guile, that extra flair needed to break them
down,'' said Aitken. ''We have lost that spark at the moment and it is
part of my job and part of each individual player's job to get it back.
''I will probably need a magic wand. All we can do is try to fine tune
them during the week and, come Saturday, it is up to them to give their
best.''
McLeish confessed that after Tommy Coyne injured himself in training
he had been awake since five o'clock on match-day worrying about letting
Kirk and McGrillen go, but was delighted with May's debut and believed
he would bring an extra dimension to the team.

Rangers 3, Kilmarnock 0
BY half-time it was serious. Throughout a first 45 minutes which
largely belonged to Kilmarnock, who were knocking the ball around with
accuracy and confidence, Rangers manager Walter Smith had shifted
uneasily, and as he entered the dressing room at the break he knew
drastic action was required.
Apart from telling the players that with a 14-point gap between
themselves and their nearest premier division challengers he was having
great difficulty in comprehending their inability to play with
composure, he read the discomfort written across David Robertson's face
and turned to one of the club's old warhorses.
A glance was enough. It was a look which John Brown, who had been
waiting patiently to re-establish himself in the side after having
recovered from injury, can understand in an instant. He was ready.
Kilmarnock didn't know what hit them. When the 33-year-old went to
work, the Rugby Park side went to pieces.
They were thrown into reverse and Rangers scored three times, twice
from the penalty spot. Smith felt Rangers should have had penalties
against Dundee United and Aberdeen within the last few weeks, but
neither he nor his players were denied on Saturday.
Brown made all the difference, even if he was reluctant to talk up the
part he played. ''It wasn't just me,'' he said afterwards. ''All of the
players listened to what was said at half-time and responded. They
seemed to relax more and were able to play.
''Me? I'm just happy to get a game. It's been a matter of waiting for
a chance, and when you get one you have to grab it.''
Brown, who gave Rangers width and power, took his opportunity and is
entitled now to believe a place ought to be found for him, even if
Robertson, who aggravated a foot injury in the first half, should be fit
enough to return immediately. Brown's rugged, no-nonsense approach to
business might just be what Rangers need to give them the urgency their
recent play has lacked.
With Brown a manager will always know what to expect, and the
likelihood is he will be offered another contract when his current one
expires at the end of this season. Players like Laudrup, Hateley and
Steven cost many millions, but in their own way the John Browns of this
footballing world are also valuable commodities.
''I really don't want to play for anyone else,'' he said, and with him
you just know he isn't merely offering platitudes for the supporters.
John Brown means every word.
Ian Durrant is equally committed to the cause, and he appeared late in
the game, when he took over from Steven, who is beginning to function
better with every game after a lengthy period of idleness also caused by
injury. Durrant, who has been written off by many of the fans, was sent
on with five minutes to go and three minutes later Rangers were given
the second of their penalties, after Colin Montgomerie had fouled
Charlie Miller.
Laudrup, who had taken the first, was supposed to take the second
also, but Durrant was having none of it. He wanted to hear again the
fans' appreciation and he stepped forward in a manner which made it
clear to everyone else that the only one person was going to take this
penalty.
''Please, don't miss this,'' said one occupant of the press box. Ally
McCoist, who was working temporarily for a Sunday newspaper, wasn't
willing the goal for Rangers' sake, because the match had already been
won. The injured striker was supporting Durrant, who needs all the
encouragement he can get these days.
As his shot from the spot hit the net the noise of Rangers' fans
approval would have been like music to his ears.
Rangers' first penalty, which gave them their second goal, was caused
by Derek Anderson's clumsy challenge on Brown. Laudrup scored, of
course. No-one expected him to miss.
That goal was scored in 68 minutes, only four minutes after the first.
Ally Maxwell and Neil Whitworth collided in Rangers' box and fell to the
ground, but play continued and the ball was transported into the other
half, where Gordon Durie took over and scored a most attractive goal.
The striker sprinted down the right and into the penalty box, where he
bewildered a couple of defenders before clipping the ball into the net.
It was a splendid goal which brought even McCoist to his feet.
However, afterwards Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten said the match
should have been halted while his central defender, Whitworth, was
''sprawled out in the box. It was an unfortunate way to lose the first
goal.
''I thought that we were excellent in the first half, we certainly
dominated the first 30 minutes, but the second half belonged to them.''
Totten would have spent most of the remainder of his weekend wondering
why his players failed to score at least once in the first half, while
Rangers were struggling to play with any kind of rhythm.
Early on Steve Maskrey was busy and giving Basile Boli, who was
booked, trouble, but the Frenchman settled and handled his problem with
greater efficiency, although he continues to look eccentric in some of
his actions.

Falkirk 1, Hibernian 0
FALKIRK manager Jim Jefferies praised a fighting display from his side
at Brockville on Saturday -- acknowledging a victory which hoisted the
club nearer the safety mark -- then blasted the standard of football in
the premier division.
Having seen his two new signings from Motherwell -- Steve Kirk and
Paul McGrillen -- become instant hits, Jefferies said: ''It wasn't a
pretty game, but we played a pretty game against Dundee United during
the week and lost. Today, the result was all important, and I thought we
deserved our win.
''However, I think most managers agree with me when I say that the
quality of football in this division is secondary now. You've just got
to slog it out, and that's sad -- it's all down to the format of the
premier division. The sooner it changes, the better.''
Certainly there was little entertainment on view for the fans, and
what there was came from Falkirk, who were, at times, sparked by the
enthusiasm of little McGrillen. It was his determination out near the
touchline which brought the only goal of the game seven minutes from
time.
''I thought I had lost the ball'', he said. ''But for some reason, the
defenders stopped and I was able to get in a cross. Scott McKenzie got
in a great header which hit the post and Steve Kirk was on the spot to
score from the rebound -- Steve rarely misses from a yard out, it's his
best position!
''I've only been at Falkirk a few days, but already I know they have
good players and there's no reason why we shouldn't stay up.
''After all, we've just beaten Hibs, and they were second top. It's a
crazy league.
''I came to Falkirk to get first team football and now that Jim
Jefferies has given me the chance, I aim to repay him. There's a lot
more to come from me once I settle in.''
Jefferies was well pleased with the debutants, who will face their old
club at Fir Park next Saturday. He said: ''Paul's perseverance got us
the goal. He really showed what a wee terrier he is. And, although Kirk
is not the best striker in the world, he gets into the right position at
the right time -- that's something we have been lacking.''
Falkirk's only moment of anxiety, on an afternoon in which Hibs never
looked like scoring, came early on when goalkeeper Tony Parks had to
make a tackle on Mark McGraw, who looked offside but was allowed to run
in on goal. Parks eventually had to limp off and left the ground on
crutches. An assessment on the ankle injury will be made when the
swelling goes down, but it is feared there may be ligament damage.
Hibernian manager Alex Miller was, obviously, unhappy with his side,
which has managed only one premier division victory outside of Edinburgh
since last March.
''I thought it was a cert 0-0 draw,'' he said. ''Terrible defending
cost us the goal.''

SCOTLAND international squad casualties from the weekend rugby
programme were given a clean bill of health when the side to meet Wales
on Saturday gathered at Murrayfield yesterday, writes Derek Douglas.
Bryan Redpath (groin), Kenny Milne and Kenny Logan (leg injuries) are
all expected to be fit. Craig Joiner, who protected a knee twinge by
sitting out the Melrose v Dundee HS FP game on Saturday, is also
expected to be ready.
Captain Gavin Hastings who missed Watsonians' defeat by West of
Scotland also took a full part in yesterday's session and there are no
worries over his fitness for Saturday, according to an SRU spokesman.
London Scottish prop Paul Burnell, Peter Walton (Northampton) and Alan
Sharp (Bristol), each suffering from medium-term injuries, were assessed
by SRU medics yesterday and the report was that they were making good
progress.
Burnell should be back playing for his club in a fortnight, Walton
should return within three weeks and although there is no date for a
return for Sharp, he is said to be recovering well from his back injury.
Bath's Andy Reed, who was scheduled for a fitness check on his back
problem, did not make the journey north to Murrayfield.

A MAJOR rift is developing within the home unions over the Welsh bid
to stage the 1999 Rugby World Cup, writes Derek Douglas.
Scotland and Ireland find themselves in alliance against Wales and
England over what appears to be a carve-up by the Welsh RU and the Rugby
Football Union, aimed at ensuring that the glamour semi-final and final
games are staged at Twickenham and Cardiff Arms Park.
The International Board meets soon to decide the venues of the 1999
competition. Wales are bidding to stage the event, with the final taking
place in Cardiff. They are supported by England -- which hosted the 1991
final at Twickenham and was unlikely to be given a second bite so soon
-- but the quid pro quo for English support seems to be that England
would host both semi-finals.
The other bid is from Australia, which entails a logistically
demanding competition with venues in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Under the terms of the Welsh bid, Scotland and Ireland, and perhaps
even France if the 1999 competition is expanded to provide five pools of
four teams, would host pool games involving their own teams.
For the Welsh bid to succeed, they require the support of the other
home unions. Yesterday, SRU International Board representative Freddie
McLeod said that he had ''put a gun at England's head'' over their
demand that they should stage back-to-back semi-finals.
''Scotland and Ireland are being confronted with what appears to be a
fait accompli by England and Wales. The Welsh say they would host the
final of the competition and England are insisting that they receive the
semi-finals, and the four home unions would get a quarter-final
apiece,'' said McLeod.
''This is not about money, it is about commonsense and putting in
place a distribution of the games that would help to promote rugby in
the British Isles.
''England are insisting on two semi-finals. We say that they should
have one and Scotland or Ireland should have the other. Ireland have
very kindly suggested that Scotland should have a semi-final and that
they would be happy with the fourth place play-off.
''I have put the pistol at England's head and I want to know why they
are demanding that they should have both semi-finals. Wales know our
position and the ball is now with them.''

* A BUSINESS consortium wants to buy a Scottish second or third
division rugby club. According to weekend reports, the next issue of
Scottish Rugby magazine will carry an advertisement, with a box number,
seeking interested clubs. Scotland IB representative Freddie McLeod said
yesterday that there was nothing within the regulations which would
preclude such a move but he advised clubs to be wary.
''If you exclude the FP clubs, whose schools probably own their
grounds, and clubs which play on public parks, then there can't be many
clubs which own their own grounds. I would urge caution. If this report
is true, then what we may have is a group of individuals wanting to make
a quick killing by selling off a ground for a supermarket.''

RANGERS manager Walter Smith was in Naples yesterday preparing to make
a bid for Czech international star Thomas Skuhrovy.
The striker has become a priority for the champions as an injury
crisis has struck the club. Mark Hateley is out until almost the end of
the season and Ally McCoist remains sidelined.
Smith and his assistant, Archie Knox, flew to Italy to watch the Serie
A clash between Naples and Genoa. Skuhrovy, 29, was playing for Genoa in
a match they lost 1-0.
Last summer he was a target for Leeds United, who were prepared to
spend around #3m to take him to England. Now Rangers are ready to offer
a similar sum to bring the Czech into the premier division.
Smith and chairman David Murray have maintained that huge sums of cash
will be spent as the Ibrox club plan their assault on Europe next
season. But now, with the injury problems, the Ibrox side could be ready
to spend immediately.
They have sold Duncan Ferguson to Everton for more than #4m and that
cash is there to be splashed on a top-class player.
Now Skuhrovy is the glamour target, the kind of player the Ibrox fans
want to see line up alongside Brian Laudrup in the champions' side.
Meanwhile Falkirk are tomorrow expected to complete the signing of
striker Maurice Johnston from Hearts.
* ABERDEEN chairman Ian Donald last night blamed sacked manager Willie
Miller for the club's plunge into the relegation zone.
He also admitted that he felt like joining the fans who had called for
his resignation after the 2-0 defeat by Motherwell at Pittodrie.
He revealed: ''They were chanting 'there's only one Willie Miller,'
but it was his team which performed like that on the park.
''I sympathise with them. It was just as frustrating for me as it was
for them. I felt like joining their protests, because it was hellishly
disappointing.
''The bottom line is that there are not a lot of people queuing up to
put money into the club.''
* ANOTHER leading Celtic player discovered at the weekend that
no-one's place in the side can be considered secure. Pierre van
Hooydonk, bought for #1.2m from FC Breda in January, was substituted
after 62 minutes of the game against Hearts because he was not playing
well enough to satisfy manager Tommy Burns.
''The same rules apply to Pierre as any other player here,'' said
Burns, ''If he is not playing well, he can be left out. When this
applies to a man who has more than 70 caps for his country, they should
all be aware they are in the same position.''
Burns was referring, of course, to team captain Paul McStay, who was
dropped two weeks go and has not played since, although it was because
of a calf strain that he missed the Hearts game. The message seems to be
getting across, as Phil O'Donnell confirmed. He reckons the fact that
McStay was left out is keeping everybody on their toes. ''I knew when I
came here there would be competition for places and that is what has
happened.''
Burns will decide today on the squad which will leave for Malaga to
meet Real Madrid tomorrow. Among other things, he has to decide whether
McStay is fit enough to take part or if he should let him play in a
reserve match on Wednesday before deciding if he is ready to return to
the first team.
Hearts, who badly missed suspended pair John Robertson and Jim Bett,
will be without another key player when they meet Dundee United in the
Tennents Scottish Cup quarter-final in two weeks' time. Craig Levein,
their international defender, begins a three-game ban then, as a yellow
card against Celtic took him over the disciplinary threshold.
Levein, who was banned for 10 matches earlier in the season after
having been involved in a punch-up with team-mate Graeme Hogg in a
pre-season friendly against Raith Rovers, will also league matches
against United and Rangers.
The latest suspension could also jeopardise Levein's place in the
Scotland squad for the European Championship game with Russia on March
29.
Most of all, however, it is a severe blow to the plans of manager
Tommy McLean, who was already angry with his players after their
performance in the 1-1 draw with Celtic. ''We didn't deserve a point,''
he said, ''and Celtic must be really disappointed. I can definitely
sympathise with Hearts supporters.
''Over the years they have had to suffer this kind of thing. We were
so disjointed it was not true. We created nothing and it is this lack of
consistency that has made us a middle-of-the-road team.''
McLean refused to allow the suspensions of Bett and Robertson to be
used as an excuse. He insisted that there were players who did well in
the cup win over Rangers earlier in the week who did not play like that
against Celtic.
Hearts, in fifth place, are one point behind Celtic, who, like Hibs,
lost ground to Motherwell in the race for second place.
Motherwell's win over Aberdeen leaves the Pittodrie side in serious
bother in second-bottom place, three points behind Kilmarnock and
Falkirk. If the Fir Park team beat Partick Thistle at Firhill tomorrow
night they would stretch their lead over Hibs to five points and reduce
Rangers' lead to 12.

THE new order of Scottish rugby emerged at the weekend. Stirling
County, home-grown and proud of it, crowned 20 years of climbing through
the ranks to become Scottish club champions and in so doing struck a
template for the entire Scottish game.
We have seen the future and it is red, white and black all over. Two
decades ago Stirling were in Division VII of the then two-year old
national league structure.
Men of vision like Ken Crichton, Ben Coull, Sandy Bryce, and Ian
Nelson sowed the seeds which blossomed in championship glory at
Bridgehaugh on Saturday. They, and others like the Scotland coach Richie
Dixon, put in place a structure which today sees most of the first XV
having graduated from the mini and midi-ranks of a decade and more ago.
The club now runs six senior sides and an under-18 XV but the seedcorn
for the future is nurtured among the 180 kids who regularly turn up for
the Sunday afternoon mini and midi tournaments.
At Bridgehaugh on Saturday nails were bitten to the quick as Stirling
held out 13-9 against Boroughmuir. For Stirling to win the championship,
Watsonians had to succumb to West of Scotland. Then the news filtered
through. A Dave Barrett drop-goal had dashed Watsonians's hopes by a
single point.
Bridgehaugh announcer Charlie Crossan sent the message out on the
public address system: ''Watsonians 12, West of Scotland 13. Stirling
are champions!''
It was the cue for general rejoicing. A table was conjured and the
McEwan's 70/- trophy appeared from the boot of SRU chief executive Bill
Hogg's car.
The honours were done by SRU president Ken Smith in a gloriously ad
hoc two-part ceremony. The microphone cable would not stretch to the
presentation table and he made the pronouncements from the stand before
coming down on to the pitch to hand the trophy to Stirling captain
Stewart Hamilton.
Hamilton was in seventh heaven. Big boys don't cry but Hammy came
close: ''I'm going to be greetin' in a moment,'' he said. ''This means
everything to me. I could live 10 lifetimes and never feel as proud and
as pleased as I do right now.''
Kenny Logan, the club's first international was ecstatic: ''Paris last
weekend and now this. It's all too much. I'm just sorry that Ian Jardine
wasn't on the field to share the success.''
Jardine, injured in Scottish colours in Paris last weekend, and a
Bridgehaugh regular for 12 seasons, watched from the sidelines as his
team-mates soaked up the Boroughmuir punishment.
''I'm a hopeless spectator. I was in agony by the end. We have striven
so hard for this over so many years that I can hardly believe that it's
happened,'' he said.
Kevin McKenzie, too, was soaking up congratulations. ''We played like
chumps today but we won and now we've won the championship.'' That isn't
exactly what he said but the meaning was clear enough.
The Stirling achievement is unique. Never before has a club risen
through the divisions to achieve the ultimate accolade of a Scottish
championship.
Yesterday the celebrations continued with a party at McKenzie's home
in Plean. Meanwhile, telephone callers to the Bridgehaugh clubhouse were
greeted ''Hello, Stirling County. Scottish Champions.''

Comedy
LOOPING and teasing woolly strands of thought into elaborate and
surreal bows, the deliciously-fluffy Lord Eddard of Izzie pondered the
increasing incidence of motorway police patrols being harassed by
free-range chickens driving Range Rovers. And while we've all heard of
the clinical cruelty with which Pavlov treated his dog, what about the
havoc wrought on Pavlov by his cat?
And on the topic of cats, does feline purring behind your living-room
sofa mask a more destructive sound? Purring cats wielding pneumatic
drills and chainsaws: they are destroying your home even as we speak --
but what are they looking for? Do mynah birds know what they're talking
about? If bees make honey, which insects make chutney? Salmon: why have
they been handed such a bad deal in the procreative stakes?
High-browed psycho-sociologists might contend that Eddie's senseless,
overwhelmingly vengeful anthropomorphism is a highly graphic means of
communicating his unease about the intolerant nastinesses of human
nature. Friday night's sell-out crowd would contend nothing of the sort,
having laughed themselves to a state of near-exhaustion.
This demonstrates the great healing triumph of Eddie's art. A
self-proclaimed transvestite sporting lipstick, black patent high heels,
and red trews, Eddie parades all manner of outlandishness before an
audience's eyes and makes it unthreatening, as well as much less
ridiculous than what passes for the norm.

Jazz
IF proof were ever needed of the timeless popularity of George
Gershwin's music, the surprisingly full house at the Theatre Royal for
Saturday night's tribute concert would suffice. With a jazz line-up of
singer Elaine Delmar, trumpeter Keith Smith, and Mike Pyne's Manhattan
Club Trio, the show ran the gamut of Gershwin from his 1919 Al Jolson
hit Swanee to They Can't Take That Away From Me, for which brother Ira
wrote the lyrics after George's death in 1937.
In an evening of mainly familiar material, played in a fairly ordinary
style by a relatively average band, Elaine Delmar's plush, velvety
vocals were a revelation. As elegant a stylist of songs as her striking
appearance would suggest, Delmar was especially captivating and her
voice best showcased on ballads, backed only by piano or bass.
Thus we heard a sumptuously slow Someone To Watch Over Me; a
delightful -- and playful -- Looking For a Boy; a simplistic,
sophisticated Blah Blah Blah and an exquisite How Long Has This Been
Going On. For Love Is Here To Stay, Delmar took the brave step of
ditching the entire band and singing completely unaccompanied. It paid
off.
What didn't pay off was Keith Smith. On trumpet he was just about
bearable. The big mistake was letting him near the microphone without
the horn to his lips. His announcements were smarmy and glory-seeking,
and his singing was little more than a bad impersonation of Louis
Armstrong's unique scat style. Delmar deserves a better co-star than
this. Maybe next time . . .

Music
FIRST things first. The Royal SNO has at last appointed a press
officer -- the most experienced in Scotland -- who will take up post in
a month. And not before time. Important information about the
organisation is still not getting through to the public in time. For
instance, there is a major change to this week's schedules.
Conductor Lawrence Foster has dropped out. He is being replaced by
principal guest conductor Alexander Lazarev. Which makes all the
difference in the world: Lazarev and Midori in Tchaikovsky? Go buy your
ticket now. It's obviously been known about long enough to get it into
last weekend's programme, but there hasn't been a single phone call or
announcement.
And so, briefly, to the music. Saturday night's concert, with
conductor Vernon Handley, was a gradual crescendo of interest and
excitement. It's hard to make Tippett's bounding Ritual Dances dull, but
somehow it was achieved in a sparkle-free and lackustre account.
Suddenly, a little heat and warmth crept in with the distinguished
pianist Joaquin Achucarro bringing mystery, atmosphere, and duende to
Falla's ravishing Nights in the Garden of Spain.
Finally, as though off the leash, the SNO, with its chorus in
bellowingly magnificent form, erupted in an incandescent account of
Walton's Belshazzar's Feast. John Connell was the gloriously resonant
narrator, and the whole mob -- offstage brass bands and all -- played
like a team with a purpose.

WHEN drummers play with brushes they usually use those shortish
strands of wire that make rather less noise than drumsticks. This
assumption precludes Han Bennink who, having swept the floor, sat down
and stroked his cymbals with the broom handle.
Stroked is the key word here because despite his football hooligan's
mien and his occasional bursts of percussive mayhem Bennink is a
sensitive musician who can tenderly fan the flame of a faithfully
executed Let's Face the Music and Dance as if he'd written it himself.
He does like a bit of theatre, though: disappearing behind a screen to
rattle away on a hidden piano; reappearing with his face covered by
variously coloured light gels; and punctuating a harmless take on Johnny
Mercer's Cuckoo Clock with manic, if appropriate, bird impersonations.
He isn't alone. Cellist Ernst Reijseger makes a Shakespearean
production out of replacing a broken string. He also essays the cello as
guitar, as double bass and -- briefly -- as pneumatic drill.
Tunes by Mercer and Irving Berlin arrive apparently from left-field
amid the Clusone's tempestuous full cry before the logic behind their
inclusion dawns: Clusone play all music, from a delicate Satie-esque
melody played with consummate control by the group's straight man,
Michael Moore, on clarinet against Reijseger's beautiful chording to the
headlong rush of something that might well make Reijseger the best
cellist the Mahavishnu Orchestra never had. They play it all with
feeling, with skill, with incredible togetherness, and one visit every
five years is not nearly enough.

Mark Fisher thinks that sitting down is better for audiences than
actors
ADVICE to the playwright. Write what you want, on whatever theme you
want, for however many characters you want, but do please beware of the
chairs. Zipping round a small selection of the 17 or so productions in
last week's FebFest, the annual festival of new writing organised by
Edinburgh University students, I couldn't help noticing the inverse
relationship between the success of a show and the number of on-stage
seats.
Be they boxes, dining chairs, couches, or stools, the more of them
there are -- or rather, the more the actors sit in them -- the more the
dramatic energy gets sucked into what is surely that same inert crevice
where all your small change and pens end up.
To be fair, this is as much a problem of direction as of writing, but
it says something about the imagination of the playwright if the actors
aren't inspired to do anything better than sit down and talk. Theatre is
about action and chairs are not.
I pass on my tuppence-ha'penny worth in much the same spirit, I hope,
as FebFest itself. It might have more of a feel of the old Scottish
Student Drama Festival than the nationwide community event it claims to
be, but then that is no great fault. What is important is that it
creates a space for young playwrights to try out their craft in front of
an appreciative audience, using committed student actors and without
having the sense of expectation that professional theatre inevitably
generates.
So, although I found Alun Bacon's Orange a meandering and
undisciplined play, self-conscious and full of meaningless nods to
Beckett and Stoppard, it was none the less warmly received by the
audience for its quirky, tangential comedy.
Like Orange, Ian McDonough's Some Boy, the Golem, a short play about a
doubting God in an increasingly cocksure world, goes in for a fair
amount of philosophising, but it is based on a more firm and original
idea. It also has novelty value in a talking lawnmower and an
inarticulate automaton in an alcoholic coma.
Alas, the chairs get the better of it -- when God isn't being
swallowed by the sofa, the actors are clutching the nearest pieces of
furniture as if to stop themselves drifting away with McDonough's
lengthy speeches.
There was much to commend David McCreight's Sex and Death, a
cleverly-structured and often very funny play, given a punchy and
well-acted production. A story about an old woman and a friendly
home-help runs in parallel with a tale about a bunch of students on an
Australian camping holiday. Just as you start to notice all the
sitting-down in the former, the latter bursts in through paper walls
bringing with it an engaging theatrical dynamic.
I like the two-stories-for-the-price-of-one approach, even if the
connection between them passes me by, but the script loses its way
three-quarters through and what starts as strong theatre ends as soap
opera.
Anita Sullivan is a confident enough writer to know that words are not
her only tool and it's a good 10 minutes into her play, The Invisible
Fat Woman, before anyone talks. Not surprisingly neither do they sit
around on chairs. Instead there's a witty charade about women's
attitudes to their bodies, which segues into a feminist fairy-tale and
finishes with a gruesome game of Hangman. It's a short show with room
for considerable development, but in its variety and moments of flair it
holds much promise for a playwright of the future.

THE strongest memory of my dad before he died was when he and I went
to the doctors. He was going back on Monday to get his ears dewaxed.
Then he was killed in a car accident during the weekend.
It changed the whole course of my life and my family's. My mum had
four kids and was pregnant at the time. He was 45, the same age as I am
now. He had a lot of living to do.
I know I'm like him because I have a terrible temper. He had his own
business which I also have. He used to come home from work, twirl us
round and carry us into the house. He was a very emotional man. I'd sit
on his knee watching This Is Your Life, cuddling up to him as the tears
streamed down his face. He had a very good, singing voice. He'd waken us
with ''Oh What A Beautiful Morning'' and open the curtains. He was the
focal point of the family.
I was 11 when he died. I ran away from home at 16. I wasn't very good
at understanding my mother. I'd lost a father, I didn't think that she'd
lost a husband.
At 14 I was really wild. I know that if my father hadn't died I'd have
gone to university. He was strict; he sent me to piano lessons, he made
me spell in front of him. We may have clashed but I adored him.
Some people who know me say I'm soft underneath. I'm told people are
scared of me. I have a gruff exterior. He had that too. After so many
years of struggling in business there's no-one I need to impress. I'd
like to be a bit more tactful though.
My mum was brought up to be a wife and she lived for my dad. It taught
me never to rely on a man. I am seeing a man now who is more like my
father, he has his own views, I can look up to him.
I had a recurrent dream, where my father came out of his coffin. The
coffin's on fire, he gets out and talks to me. It wasn't frightening.
They change a lot, but I do think I have a relationship with my father
in my dreams.

<HEADLINE>Greek lesson for the executive of Ayr NFU Philosophising on CAP</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979648702</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LIMITED experience of the doings of the Ayr executive of the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland suggests that the Greek philosophers
are rarely quoted in their deliberations.
Quotations were almost the order of the day at their most recent
meeting, however. Milk convener Tom Reid started the ball rolling with
his comment that there's many a slip twixt cup and lip. The quotation
fitted well, as he modestly acknowledged expressions of goodwill
supporting his nomination for the milk convenership at national level.
Unfortunately, he attributed the thought to our national bard, Robert
Burns. He might have got away with it elsewhere but not in Ayr. Everyone
else in the room knew that, whoever said it, it wasn't the local lad.
Our vote would have gone to Shakespeare but the office book of
quotations has it down as a very ancient proverb indeed -- sometimes
attributed to Homer.
Tom Reid, for his part, was quick to make amends by accepting the
suggestion that the quotation he was really looking for, as a man of
caution, was the one about best laid plans of mice and men. No argument
on the source of that one.
No sooner had that set of quotations been dealt with than we had
someone else quoting American president Harry S Truman on the relative
merits of having someone inside the tent peeing out or outside the tent
peeing in. That was, in fact, the response of President Lyndon B
Johnston when asked why he retained Edgar J Hoover as head of the FBI.
Yes, when we had the book out for Homer we looked that one up too.
The final quotation of the evening was one whose source we could not
track down -- the one about there being nothing so powerful as an idea
whose time has come. In searching for a source for that we came upon
another of equal relevance, from Alain Emile Auguste Chartier who said:
''Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when that's the only one you
have got.''
Both might apply to aspects of the farming scene today. There appears
to be an amazing unanimity for the thought that ''there ain't gonna be
no change to the Common Agricultural Policy''. Subsidies and grants will
remain in place and any changes will be minimal. Sir Hector says so.
Former SNFU president John Cameron says so. Current SNFU president John
Ross subscribes to that view as well. UK Agriculture Minister William
Waldegrave also sees the CAP continuing but has a personal vision of it
becoming more market-orientated.
One of Mr Waldegrave's junior ministers, Lord Howe, warned the
European Outlook conference in London that, in his opinion, the
expansion of the European Union to incorporate the six former Soviet
Union states could cost the equivalent of #11bn a year.
He questioned whether the current member states would take that figure
on board in order to support Central and Eastern European agriculture.
The stimulation of the farming industry in Eastern Europe -- with CAP
subsidies -- could lead to internal surpluses which would rapidly become
unsustainable, he forecast.
''A radical change in policy would be the only option.''
So there is more than one idea around. Perhaps the best advice comes
from Mr Keith Norman, technical manager for the farm management company
Velcourt. His view is that farmers should put thoughts of subsidies and
grants to one side and concentrate on running an efficient business.
More tonnes per hectare was his philosophy when it came to improving the
bottom line.
One group of farmers which is reportedly not putting thoughts of grant
to one side is based on Islay. For years they complained at the damage
wrought to their fields by overwintering geese. The island became a
mecca for European visitors, complete with shotguns, and some local
farmers were at times licensed to kill.
The conservation lobby's concerns were eventually met with the
introduction of a compensation scheme which allowed the geese to graze
and the farmer to collect #9.50 a head.
Now, we gather, farmers are complaining at the lack of geese. Their
argument is that on the day a count was taken, for compensation
purposes, half the geese had taken themselves off elsewhere. We suspect
the enumerators just fell asleep counting geese.

THE Farmer and the Breadwinner aren't too sure about the BBC. They
sent a couple of wet-behind-the-ears reporters to Kenya to make a
programme about holidaying there. Their message can be summarised as:
''Don't go. It's too dangerous, but isn't this a nice shot of me with
the Masai tribesman?''
That was about four weeks ago but we've come to Kenya anyway. We're
having a grand holiday and so far the only violence we've seen is on the
television. We saw the English tourists enjoying themselves at a
football match in Dublin.
The Kenyans are unimpressed but at least, so many of them having been
educated by Scottish missionaires, they do distinguish between Scotland
and England.
We're staying at an old club put up by the empire builders who are now
outnumbered in a racial mixture. It's well run, clean and cheap and
we're recovering. The club also has a good library and I want to give
you a flavour of the first book I got from it. It was written by an
Englishman who like many couldn't settle back into the family (textile)
business after the war and decided to become a farmer.
Fifteen hundred pounds got him settled on 1300 acres of unbroken
African bush with the help of the bankers and the government. The first
year he broke in 200 acres and grew a good crop of wheat. The second
year his wife persuaded him that a rat-infested grain store three miles
away wasn't really what she had come to Africa for and that he must
build a house.
By the time he'd been there five years he had a dairy, pigs and a
shop. He had failed in pigs and linseed but still his employees were
well into three figures.
It's a wonderful farming story and I wish I could tell you it all but
I'm sure you'll be able to empathise with the farm books.
The accounting system used was where you credit the implement account
with the work done on the barley. The barley account is then debited
with that plus the fuel used for ploughing, etc, all of which is then
credited to the fuel account. The barley account is then credited the
full value of what is fed to the pigs and that is debited against the
bacon account. The barley is then debited with dung which is credited to
the pigs' account and the implement account is debited the cost of the
repairs.
At that moment a boy appears. He wants leave because his brother is
dying before he gets there.
You get back to the office and start again. At the point where the
barley account gets credited with the baled straw another woolly head
appears and says that the wheel on the plough has just finished breaking
so you go and sort that out.
Two months later you go to the office looking for some seed samples.
The book is still open at the barley account. You decide you must do
something about it. But as you have forgotten where you were in the
barley account you turn to the wheat account which is much simpler as
you don't feed it to livestock but sell it all.
You are just about to debit the wheat account with fuel and fertiliser
when a woolly head pokes round the door and asks for a rat trap. The
sack of maize that was opened yesterday to give the tractor drivers
their rations is empty and he suspects rats.
So you go the store to try to find who actually stole the maize and by
next year you are really in trouble with the accounts because by this
time the income tax people are really beginning to niggle.
After years of this system of accounting ''my pen pal'' (as this
settler called his tax man) invited him to prove his assertion that he
had made no profit and should therefore be exempt from tax. It was then
that the disadvantages of his filing system showed.
I used to file unopened, all letters that came in unsealed or windowed
envelopes straight on to the fire. It saved a lot of unnecessary worry.
If HM servants had written to me it must have been in windowed letters
for it was not until I received a registered letter with a lion and a
unicorn on it that I knew there was such a thing as income tax in the
Colony.
The settler's panic was eased by a visit to an accountant who said to
bring in all the paperwork he had and he'd soon fix it. And indeed he
had a good deal of paperwork. A heavy smoker he used the backs of fag
packets to record all his small cattle deals, wages and purchases of
building materials. He had two large vegetable baskets and a butter box
under the office table full of these memoranda.
The accountant was unimpressed. Do you take my office for a salvage
dump? When I'm in the market for waste paper I'll let you know. What
sort of information do you think I'll get from the back of a dirty
cigarette box which says ''Choge -- fined two shillings stealing, or
Borrowed kerosene Johnny C or Friday -- sixty 294 M. Need more string?''
Well, I burned them.
Nevertheless, in due course some very impressive balance sheets were
produced though for all I understood of them they might as well have
been in Braille. Though they proved I owed him nothing my pen-pal seemed
satisfied.
The figure at the bottom bank account was the only one that interested
me. When the drs started to be replaced by the occasional cr it struck
me that I might be winning. When I saw all the tractors I took out a
cigarette box and made a list of their estimated values, then added the
latest cr figure. This was my statement of account and they made
pleasant reading.
The Gate Hangs Well by James W. Stapleton was published in 1956 by
Hammond &amp; Hammond.

<HEADLINE>New Zealand lamb exporters worried about shortages</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WARNING signals are flashing in the lamb market as imports build up
again, but the New Zealanders seem more worried about possible shortages
than a supply flood, writes MIKE INGHAM.
Latest official figures reflect a sudden sharp increase in landed
volumes during the autumn. November tonnage was nearly 16% greater than
a year earlier.
However, the picture is distorted by the effects of serious disruption
in the UK market last year, and by more recent events in New Zealand.
The import upturn in late 1994 followed a long period of subdued
volume. Poor sales early in the season forced the New Zealanders to
reduce shipments for much of the year. Total arrivals were probably at
least 10% lighter than in 1993, even taking account of the increase now
visible.
The heavier supply has not disturbed the market, because home
production since last summer has been well below forecast levels.
Consumer purchasing estimates by the market research company AGB suggest
that the extra imports have merely filled some of the gap left by the
shortfall in UK slaughterings, with New Zealand lamb sales up about 10%
in the last three months of the year, while about a third less
home-killed product went through retail checkouts than in the final
quarter of 1993.
''We suddenly found sales got surprisingly good late last year, after
a tough time earlier on,'' said the New Zealand Meat Producer Board's UK
manager, Martyn Saines.
Traders report the general market tone as having remained fairly good
since Christmas, although patchier. Bouts of bad weather have disturbed
demand occasionally in the last few weeks, and the New Zealanders may be
suffering knock-on effects from the French market weakness which has
slightly destabilised home-killed lamb business.
One question worrying traders now is whether the New Zealand exporters
will over-react to their unexpected good fortune and push too much
product into the UK market.
There are plenty of precedents for this, and with quota increasing
ahead of the new Gatt trade arrangements, there are now fewer regulatory
impediments to over-shipping.
Brussels has agreed to bring forward part of the Gatt increase. New
Zealand is now entitled to ship nearly 150,000 tonnes of sheepmeat into
Europe, including the UK, in the first six months of this year, whereas
the previous limit was 205,000 tonnes over a full year.
The New Zealanders argue that the boost is more apparent than real.
They claim it merely reflects the extreme seasonality both of their
production and demand for their output within the EU.
Nevertheless, there is at least one item of good news for British
producers. For reasons that are not yet clear, the New Zealanders seem
to have mishandled their negotiations with Brussels over pulling forward
the Gatt quota increase. The consequence may be a shortage of the
high-quality chilled lamb which competes most directly against
home-produced sheepmeat.
New Zealand apparently settled for a simple halving of its
15,000-tonne annual chilled quota to apply in the first six months of
this year.
In practice, traders need most of the annual quota in the first half,
because demand for chilled lamb is even more seasonal than for the
frozen product. Importers are now talking openly of being unable to fill
orders from UK customers, including Marks &amp; Spencer.
M&amp;S is understood to have approached the Meat Board seeking
reassurance. A board source admitted privately: ''It looks as though we
may have a problem, though we don't know yet how serious it will be.''

THE Pentos parent of the Dillon and Rymans chains is locked in crisis
talks with its banks which are reluctant to give it any more support,
writes ANDREW WILSON.
Tomorrow it has a meeting with Barclays and Midland as a #55m credit
facility expires and the banks are extremely reluctant to extend it by
another #20m.
However, former chairman Terry Mahoer, who founded the company, has
said that he is interested in buying the Dillons bookshop chain and has
approached merchant bankers Schroders for more information.
It is believed that several other venture capital groups and trade
buyers have made approaches although Edinburgh-based John Menzies has
dismissed suggestions that it should become involved.
Although the two banks may be prepared to roll over the existing
loans, they are concerned about the additional #20m requested by chief
executive Bill McGrath even although the March quarterly rent bill
looms.
In January last year, there was a #45m emergency rights issue at 25p
compared with Friday's closing level of 8p and which effectively
prevents any chance of shareholders coughing up more.
Mr McGrath irritated many when he closed down the Athena poster shops
by putting them into receivership on the grounds that otherwise the
whole group would have collapsed.

SHIN Nippon, which doubled in size through a conversion share issue
last year, has announced a 12.3% decline in diluted net asset value to
138.9p.
The setback in the year to end-January compared with a fall of only
8.6%, on a sterling basis, in the Tokyo Second Section index. The #43m
Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford fund is invested in smaller Japanese
companies.
Shin Nippon's underperformance came in the first six months. Although
the Tokyo market took a beating, the trust's net asset value fell only
18.8% in the second half, compared with a massive 23.7%
sterling-equivalent plunge in the second section index.
A loss of 1.13p per share -- 36% worse than last year -- was incurred.
No dividend will be paid.
Among the negative factors highlighted by trust director George Veitch
were the ''large and vastly overpriced'' listings of Japan Telecom and
Japan Tobacco. Market sentiment was hit badly by the issues, which had
lost 40% by January 31.
Last month's Kobe earthquake also hurt the portfolio. Estimates of the
cost of the disaster vary widely between 10 trillion and 15 trillion yen
(#65bn and #98bn).
With the Japanese market having enjoyed a good run in the earlier part
of the year, the trust was not surprised to see it fall back in line
with world markets in the second half.
Although the Tokyo market is not looking very healthy at present and
sentiment is generally bad, the trust said the economy had clearly been
recovering quite steadily prior to the earthquake.

PETER SMITH (right) is retiring as chairman of both Securicor Group
and Security Services after the annual meetings in March.
He will be succeeded by Sir Neil Macfarlane, 58, who became a
non-executive director of both companies in 1993.
He was Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam from 1974 until 1992, held junior
ministerial posts in education, science, arts and entertainment, and was
Minister for Sport.
Mr Smith's biggest achievement is probably enabling the Securicor's
half-owned Security Services subsidiary to take a 40% stake in the
Cellnet mobile phone system with BT as the holder of the other 60% to
provide some impetus to the more pedestrian parcels and security
operations.

ABERDEEN Trust is moving closer to the action in the recently
turbulent Latin-American markets, by setting up an office in Florida,
writes IAN McCONNELL.
The decision by the fund management group, which has about #100m
invested in the region, follows the relocation of its Far East
management team to Singapore about three years ago.
As well as benefiting management of funds in the region, the office
was very successful in attracting new investment.
Director Bev Hendry will head the Fort Lauderdale operation and will
have a team of three reporting to him. Florida is the hub for
Latin-American financial markets, in which Abtrust's major interests are
in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
The office, which the company plans to open shortly after the start of
its new financial year on October 1, will also help cement its
relationship with major shareholder Philadelphia International Equities.
Part of the Four States Bank of Philadelphia, it holds a 14% stake.
Abtrust's Latin-American Investment Trust, Emerging Markets Investment
Trust and Emerging Markets Unit Trust will be the beneficiaries of the
move.
Being a fairly specialised fund manager, Abtrust has found its clients
prefer it to be close to where their money is invested and it is hoped
the new office will entice more cash to Latin America.
The effects of the Mexican financial crisis, which began at the end of
last year, were felt throughout the emerging region, which already had a
volatile reputation.
Mr Hendry said: ''The recent developments in Latin-American markets
show they are very volatile and it helps being a little nearer the
action.''
He believes, in spite of recent events, that the long-term outlook
remains exciting.

THIS IS A QUOTE
Last year has been an absolute nightmare for us. We would never have
got involved in the house purchase had we known about the traumas
awaiting us.
Mrs Helen Wishart
NEWSVIEW
NELLIE Berry hasn't had a proper bath for two months.
Instead, the 85-year-old, who suffers from dementia, has to stand to
be washed because her daughter, Mrs Helen Wishart, has a bad back and
can't lift her in and out of the bath.
Nellie is in need of expert care, but sadly she has become the focus
of a dispute between her daughter and Strathclyde Regional Council over
the use of family assets to meet a #5000 bill for residential care
provided for Mrs Berry last year.
The region claims it is legally obliged to recover the money and will
raise court proceedings if necessary.
On the other hand, the Wisharts claim to have received advice from
social workers that they would be able to recover all the money they had
spent buying and upgrading Mrs Berry's house in East Kilbride.
The local authority house was purchased at a discounted price of
#10,500, but is thought to have a market value of #30,000.
The case of Nellie Berry has relevance for many families faced with
the staggering cost of nursing home and residential home care as
National Health Service provision is wound down.
It will be of special relevance to families who assisted elderly
parents to buy their council houses at a discount in anticipation of a
nest-egg when their parents passed on.
That property-owning excitement from the 1980s onwards has now been
transformed into a grim realisation that the financial pay-off is not
going to happen.
Moreover, the Government's boast of family wealth cascading down
through the generations has become a sick joke.
The Wisharts' difficulties began in July 1991 when they decided to
borrow #10,500 so that Mrs Berry, who had no savings of her own, could
buy her house.
The rationale was that Mrs Berry would then have rent-free
accommodation and a few extra pounds in her purse each week.
In return, the house was willed to Mr and Mrs Wishart who looked upon
it as a ''retirement nest-egg'' after the capital debt had been repaid.
In October 1993, Mrs Berry suffered a septicaemic stroke and was
removed from her home to Hairmyres Hospital. She was then taken to
Udston Hospital for assessment by the region's social work department
who judged her to be suffering from dementia.
The Wisharts met social work representatives who advised them that any
property owned by Mrs Berry would be taken into account regarding
financial help she might receive.
However, the Wisharts claim they were also told they would be would be
able to reclaim money paid out by them for the house purchase,
redecoration, and settlement of gas and electricity bills.
They also claim they were advised against putting Mrs Berry back into
her own home or even taking her to live with them.
Mrs Berry was subsequently transferred to the Salvation Army Eventide
Home, in Milton of Campsie, in January 1994.
At a meeting with social workers in the Eventide Home, Mrs Wishart was
instructed to post Mrs Berry's pension book, which contained hundreds of
pounds in unclaimed vouchers, to the DSS Cumbernauld. It was sent by
recorded delivery and then went missing for some time. It eventually
turned up at the nursing home. During this time the family incurred
further debt trying to provide pocket money, cigarettes, clothing, and
footwear for Mrs Berry.
Mr Morton Wishart said: ''My wife and I were in an overdraft situation
due to legal and other expenses connected with the house.
''We cleaned out the house, had it decorated, changed curtains, and
let it through an agent for a minimum period of six months.''
As the weeks passed, the Wisharts became more worried due to the lack
of information from the social work department. At the same time, they
were being asked by Salvation Army management who was going to pay the
mounting debts. It was clear now that the department was not going to
fund the residential home care.
In February of last year, after Mrs Berry had been given a medical
examination to establish her grasp of events, ownership of the house in
East Kilbride was signed over to the Wisharts.
They were later horrified when Mrs Berry received a letter from the
nursing home management informing her that, as she was more than #4000
in debt to them, she would be removed from the home on November 30. Mrs
Wishart received a similar letter.
A stay of eviction was obtained and the Wisharts removed Mrs Berry
from the home in January. Mrs Wishart has since given up her work as a
secretary to care for her mother in the Wisharts' small terraced cottage
at Milton of Campsie.
Strathclyde region takes the view that it is required by law to take
capital values of houses into account when making assessments for
residential or nursing home care and has threatened legal action if the
bill for Mrs Berry's care, now amounting to #5000, is not met.
In the final analysis, the Wisharts could sell the house in East
Kilbride and still leave some of their legacy intact. But they argue Mrs
Berry was a short-stay patient and should not have been regarded as a
self-funding resident.
Mrs Wishart said: ''Last year has been an absolute nightmare for us.
We would never have got involved in the house purchase had we known
about the traumas awaiting us.
''What I am doing is virtually a 24-hour caring job. Because of my
husband's shifts, I get half-an-hour to myself each week. Although my
mother is much more contented now than when she was in the home, I must
confess it is a great strain.''
A spokesperson for Strathclyde region explained: ''Mrs Berry moved
into the care home in January 1994. As Mrs Berry owned her house, which
was valued at #30,000, and there was no-one living in it, the
regulations demanded that the value of the house had to be taken into
account.
''In July, the Wisharts had the titles of the house transferred to
them. But the law doesn't permit you to give away your assets in order
to qualify for benefits; so, although the title of the house was in the
name of the Wisharts, it doesn't alter the fact that Mrs Berry had that
asset.''
''Normally we would take a charging order on the asset, then when the
person passed on, a charge would be made on the person's capital assets
to pay the care debt.
''We were unable to do that in this case because the Wisharts had the
title of the house transferred to them.
''Things came to a head towards the end of the year when the
residential home's proprietors made it clear that Mrs Berry couldn't
continue to stay in the home without the debt being cleared.
''Although the council wasn't obliged to do anything about that, it
felt it didn't want to disturb an old lady at that stage; so the council
paid the outstanding debt. However, the council did make it clear that
it would expect that money to be paid back from the value of the
house.''
Strathclyde's Labour leader, Mr Robert Gould, has already expressed
the view that property valued at up to #50,000 should be disregarded
when assessments are made for the payment of elderly care. He has called
on the Government to make the necessary legislative change.
Under current legislation the council has no obligation to fund care
where an old person has a house valued at more than #8000.
Mr Gould is unhappy that his council appears to be getting the blame
for Government legislation which forces more and more old people to pay
for their residential or nursing home care.
Earlier this week health authorities were instructed to review
services to ensure chronically ill people who need long term care
receive such help.
The order -- from Ministers -- came as new guidelines were launched
aimed at ending the controversy over the decline in continuing care.
It also set out plans for an independent appeals system for families
faced with devastating nursing bills for disabled relatives.
Instructions were also given on when health authorities should pay for
long-term care.
However, doctors' leaders have condemned the guidance and called
instead for national standards of care.
They warned that the long-term losers would be friends and families
who acted as carers and would have to bear the financial burden.
Dr Mac Armstrong, secretary of the British Medical Association, said:
''This guidance clearly signals the end of the welfare state providing
free care from the cradle to the grave.''

DANGEROUS, old-fashioned drugs are being prescribed by GPs to save
money, according to a report by the independent Social Affairs Unit.
Government guidelines which take no account of the true cost of
treatment are blamed for the trend.
Depression, which affects more than two million Britons each year,
continues to be treated with older and less-effective drugs, which in
some cases increases the likelihood of accidents and suicide.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are cheaper than newer
pharmaceuticals, but ''the risk of accident, suicide, and intolerability
are greatly increased, resulting in a signficant increase in overall
cost,'' according to Professor Ian Hindmarch and Diane Fairweather, of
the Human Psychopharmacology Research Unit at Surrey University.
They claim switching to newer drugs, such as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), ''could save over 400 lives every year''.
The report highlights reaction time tests showing those who are
prescribed the older drugs and who drive are potentially more lethal
than people who drink and drive.
Patients taking one TCA are six times more likely to be involved in a
road accident than those taking other drugs.
However, the new anti-depressants in general do not impair
performance.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie has binoculars poised for a spot of bird-watching
THIS time, I had told myself, I was going to spend more time in the
islands of Shetland. For Shetland (and Orkney too) calls its biggest
island Mainland and thinks of it as a land in its own right, with
offshore islands, in the same way Scotland would think of Mull as one of
its islands.
As always, the plan was to watch birds, for which Shetland is among
the best, not just for unusual species but for the sheer mass of
breeding birds. Already my binoculars were on my shoulder waiting to go.
I had flown up for a few days though, in some respects, the most
interesting way to come into Shetland is by ferry from Aberdeen. Somehow
the sea seems natural, the way that travellers always came, right back
to the first Vikings, though nowadays most have more peaceful purposes.
In any case, landing at Sumburgh Airport gave the excuse to pick up a
car and digress to the marvellous bird cliffs up the great heights of
Sumburgh Head. Here fulmars circle tirelessly, with razorbill and shags
nearer the foot of the cliffs, the unmistakable blue, yellow and red
beaks of the puffins, solemn outside their burrows. The view is superb.
Heading north, for Unst and the most northerly wildlife reserve at
Hermaness, it is always worthwhile lingering on Yell, the middle of the
three big islands. Shetland has 85% of Britain's red-throated divers,
beautiful birds with a wailing call that echoes over wetland and moor,
and Yell has the bulk of them. We did not have to wait long before we
saw a pair, not far off the main road, gliding majestically over the
lochan, their red throats clear in the bright air.
Fetlar to the north-east of Yell also has red-throated divers but
became famous in the bird world a while ago when the big, rare snowy
owls nested there for several years, first spotted by that well-known
Shetland birder, Bobby Tulloch. Though only single birds have returned
recently, birdwatchers are optimists, and the RSPB wardens are always
looking. It is also a fine place to see phalaropes, little water birds
turning endless circles in every tiny gleam of water.
At Unst, with a splendid view of Muckle Flugga, the first task was to
cross the clifftop moor, a spot to linger and watch the puffins sunning
themselves on the grass cliff. With the binoculars moving all the time,
it was not long before I spotted Hermaness's most unlikely and
celebrated resident -- an albatross, stretching out its huge wingspan on
its rock. Somehow, the bird got this far north from the southern
hemisphere, and never went back.
The Outer Isles, to both east and west, can also be good for birds and
each island has its own distinctive personality. To the east, the first
is Whalsay, reached by boat from Laxi Voe, half way up Mainland. Around
a thousand people live in this busy fishing centre, which boasts some of
the world's best fishing boats, and a processing factory that sends its
wares as far as Australia.
Out Skerries, further east, has no direct link from Whalsay, and it
meant a return to the Mainland for a boat from Vidlin, just north of
Laxo. Out Skerries' cliffs are superb, pounded and punched into arches
and blow holes by the great seas. They have also claimed many ships,
which attracts marine archaeologists.
Papa Stour to the west is almost too close to West Mainland to be an
outer island. Foula, Shetland's most westerly island, makes up for it,
some 27 miles from the old capital of Scalloway. We could not resist a
short stop there for the ruined sixteenth-century castle, built by the
hated Scottish Earl, Patrick Stewart, who so oppressed Shetland.
From the air or sea, the most striking feature of Foula is the Kame,
1220ft of sheer cliff, second only to St Kilda's great cliffs. Foula's
name comes from thje Old Norse Fugl ey, meaning bird island and it is
well named. Except for St Kilda, Foula was the first place in Britain to
be colonised by fulmars -- though it is hard to imagine today that they
were ever rare, with thousands of the stocky, stiff-winged birds
circling through the strange mist over the Kame.
My last island was Fair Isle, mid-way between Shetland and Orkney,
which can claim to be the most famous bird island of all. It was 20
years since I had last been there. Some things had changed, the birds
were the same . . . but fascinating Fair Isle calls for a whole story,
all to itself.

Sheila Waddell discovers an enchanting side of Provence
SOME people claim Peter Mayle's book A Year in Provence made the area
fashionable, but the locals blame Princess Caroline of Monaco for buying
a house at St Remy de Provence.
These days Provence is no longer the place to pick up a farmhouse for
a song, but it has always attracted artists. It was to Arles that
Vincent Van Gogh came and produced many of his masterpieces, while
Cezanne worked in an attic in Aix-en-Provence. Sadly, little trace
remains of Van Gogh's presence here, as the house he immortalised in
paint has been demolished. Cezanne's atelier, however, has been
preserved for posterity. It lies not far from Mont St Victoire, whose
craggy peak he painted more than 60 times.
Aix-en-Provence is a university town attracting students from all over
the world. One of the main places to see or be seen is the tree-lined
Cours Mirabeau with its many open-air cafes while the town boasts a
colourful market, cathedral and many churches and museums along its
cobbled streets. Expensive restaurants abound, but you can enjoy a
three-course set lunch with wine for less than #10 in the Place des
Cardeurs.
Travelling to Marseilles on the coast is worthwhile. Marseilles had a
grim reputation it does not deserve and you are far more likely to be
mugged in some parts of Paris than here. The port is full of fascinating
old ''sea dogs'', especially first thing in the morning, while later in
the day a small train runs up to the church of Notre Dame de la Garde.
From here you can look out on the Chateau d'If, where the legendary
Count of Monte Christo was supposedly imprisoned.
Avignon, site of the Palais des Papes, has an entirely different
flavour. This town replaced Rome as the centre of the Roman Catholic
faith in the fourteenth century. At one stage there were even two Popes
-- a French one and an Italian one. The vast rooms of the Palais des
Papes are largely empty, apart from paintings of French Popes and a
number of artefacts. However, there are some magnificent frescoes on the
walls, while there is a panoramic view of Avignon and the Pont d'Avignon
from the ramparts.
But the more enchanting side of Provence is to be found in the
countryside. If you drive up in the hills to Fontaine de Vaucluse you
pass numerous farmhouses and places where you can buy local wine for 60p
a litre. Even wine which is appellation controlee costs a mere #1 a
litre. The locals buy supplies in a five-litre plastic container called
a ''cube'', short for cubitaine. These cost around #2 and save problems
when it comes to transporting wine home.
Fontaine de Vaucluse is famed for its spring, known since Roman times
and more recently investigated by Jacques Cousteau, who took a diving
craft down to explore its depths. Many locals like to come here at
weekends to eat at outdoor restaurants. There is also a museum of the
resistance, celebrating the heroism of the Maquis in the Second World
War, but younger visitors often prefer to fish in the river than receive
a history lesson. There are many other mountain towns, but those worth a
visit include the legendary citadel of Les Baux.
For many visitors a trip to the Camargue is essential. This land of
marshes, wild bulls and white horses has captured a place in most
people's imagination, especially since one of Alastair Maclean's
thrillers Caravan to Vaccares was filmed there.
On the way you pass through Martigues, a small fishing town popular
with nineteenth and twentieth-century artists. Soon the land becomes
flat and dark and large birds can be seen taking off in flight. A ferry
across a muddy river takes you to the road to Etang de Vaccares, a
swampy lagoon. Fields of black, horned bulls are on either side and
white-maned horses gallop free. Surprisingly, much of the Camargue has
now been cultivated, making it less wild than expected. The white
horses, which are brown for the first year of life, are remarkably tame
and willing to pose for photos in exchange for sugar lumps.
To capture the full flavour you should go in May, when gipsies from
all over Europe celebrate the festival of Sara, their patron saint, in
Les Sainte Marie de la Mer. If you drive on to St Gilles the road leads
to Arles, the former capital of Roman Gaul and a treasure trove of Roman
remains. The main boulevard is full of outdoor cafes which are ideal for
relaxing in after a day's sightseeing.

THE best-known put-down in the lexicon of love must be: ''Not tonight
Josephine.'' Yet, paradoxically, history has recorded Napoleon as the
more ardent of the two. After their marriage, Napoleon bombarded
Josephine with amorous outpourings as he campaigned in Italy.
A turbulent epistle from 1797 shows the little Corsican in a variety
of moods -- caustic (''You are a wretch, truly perverse, truly stupid, a
real Cinderella''), jealous (''who can this wonderful new lover be who
takes up your every moment?), threatening (''Beware, Josephine; one fine
night the doors will be broken down and there I shall be'') -- before he
succumbs to the final passionate outburst, ''I hope to hold you in my
arms before long, when I shall lavish upon you a million kisses, burning
as the equatorial sun.''
The man who overturned states and redrew the map of Europe remained in
thrall to the older Josephine, though he divorced her and married an
Austrian princess in the pursuit of an heir.
Their story is told in a new book Famous Love Letters: Messages of
Intimacy and Passion. Thirty-four pairs of lovers and their lives are
featured. The writers in the main are men; not surprisingly maybe, since
many of their opposite numbers in earlier centuries would not have been
literate. Mistresses rather than wives abound, again not surprisingly
since curlered domesticity is hardly the stuff of romance. Lucrezia
Borgia had totted up three husbands and a possibly incestuous son before
she attracted the attentions of the Venetian poet Pietro Bembo.
He tells her that: ''The flame of true love is a mighty force, and
most of all when two equally matched wills in two exalted minds contend
to see which loves the most . . .'' Which may well be true, but
hyperventilates into bathos.
That's the trouble with love letters -- those from ordinary folk as
well. The most passionate, high-falutin' sentiments can so easily cause
groaning of the wrong type if read by the detached observer.
Perhaps the most tender of all the entries in Famous Love Letters is
from someone neither famous nor literate. Sincerity gives force to
convict Peter Withers as he writes to his young wife on the eve of
transportation to Australia in 1831. ''We (h)ears we shall get our
freedom in that Country, but if I gets my freedom even so i am shure I
shall Never be happy except I can have the Pleshur of ending my days
with you and my dear Children, for I dont think a man ever loved a woman
so well as I love you.''
* Famous Love Letters: Messages of Intimacy and Passion, edited by
Ronald Tamplin, is published by Reader's Digest at #16.95.

* Maureen Beattie talks about her dad Johnny, who'll have spent 43
years in showbusiness this year
DAD and I are similar; we're both boneheaded -- ''I'm right and you're
wrong'' types. We have heated discussions, put it that way.
My father's principles are loyalty and honesty, he has a lot of both.
I would like to think I practised those qualities. Dad's very generous,
in spirit and with money. He means well. We both mean well but sometimes
get it wrong. He loathes my smoking. He counts the dowts in my ashtray.
I don't gravitate towards men who look like him. He's got an incredibly
long body and short legs and it would be impossible to match that.
There have been moments when he's been vulnerable.
I remember being at a big social occasion where two guys started a
fight. Dad intervened, but they got more aggressive. So I threw myself
on top of him yelling ''Don't you touch my father''. I would have
strangled any one of them if they'd tried. Suddenly my father needed my
protection. I always want to be my dad's daughter. I don't want to call
him Johnny.
The first time I was asked to do a play I thought it was immoral. I
thought, I can't do it, because I can't ask my mum and dad to come and
see it.
They were a moral guideline for me. That was way back in my 20s. But
I've used that. Would I be happy to ask my dad to see this? I've put
myself out of work because of it. My dad would think that quite right.
The greatest compliment he ever gave me, and I cherish the phrase was
''You're one of the most life-enhancing people I know''. I think he
really believes it. He hasnae found me out yet.

A girl wants to be friends with her mother -- but wants to win the
respect of her father. Anvar Khan investigates the nature of this
crucial relationship
IT is generally thought that the father and daughter relationship is
the most important for a woman. Your dad is your introduction to the
opposite sex. If he is horrible then you will find horrible men
attractive. If he erodes your self-esteem you will find someone who
dispenses with the remains.
If, however, your father is a wonderful, caring man, you will feel
safe with people who have the same dominant qualities.
The women interviewed here, when questioned, disprove the above. But
they were quick to point out which character traits they believe they
share with their dads. These were, incidentally, the more aggressive
ones; temper, stubbornness and determination.
While women are keen to praise their mums, they tend to be more
critical of their fathers. I don't know if this is an innate, kindred
feminism, or a burgeoning awareness that men are different, but women,
from an early-age, seem to put their dads on rations. Only a certain
number of allowances for their shortcomings will be made. Expectations
of a father are high. He is not merely to serve but inspire.
If a father and daughter get on and become friends, their relationship
provides an emotional security for the rest of their lives. Of course,
that is true, of any parent or child. But the difference is this. Women
want to be admired by their dads, and fathers want to respected by their
daughters. Often, girls believe that the quickest way to their daddy's
heart is through success. Because the surest way to break it is through
marriage.
Most of the time, daughters would like to be on elastic, lent out for
a while, to cut through a big, bad world, and safely returned to the
arms of a man who promised to be stronger than them. This too, is what
daughters simply ask of their partners. The men they'll spend the second
half of their life with.

* Jill Belch, 40, consultant rheumatologist and vascular physician,
talks about her father, industrialist Sir Ross Belch, 75
I COULD never be in charge of my father. He's a very powerful
personality, we revert to the father/daughter relationship but we're
equals. He had four daughters, but my criticism of my father would be
that he's not very liberated.
All his daughters are in professions, he encouraged us to work and go
to university, but deep down in his heart he believes that we should
really be ironing our husband's shirts. We had a female cat, so my dad
insisted that the dog was a male, because it was too much being
surrounded by all these women. I think on day one he was probably
disappointed at each birth because he wanted a son, but never regretted
it from day two.
Our father believes that education stands you in good stead. But I
resented being sent away to boarding school. My mother missed us more.
From the age of eight to 14 I was in complete opposition to him. I
remember being on a family holiday and staring mutinously at him and him
staring mutinously at me. He said I was being dumbly insolent. My father
and I are very alike. As soon as I could answer back we fought like cat
and dog. But I haven't fought with my Dad since I was 14. They've been
replaced with fights with my husband.
I remember when we were small we all had chickenpox and pressing the
bell for attention. My father marched up and told us to stop pressing
the bell, that it was ridiculous. We didn't press it but it rang again.
He was raging. Turned out it was someone at the front door. I always
thought that so unfair.

AT long last we managed to clap eyes on Brigitte Bardot last week. The
screen goddess who wreaked pubescent havoc on my generation turned up to
show solidarity with animal welfare demonstrators outside the Council of
Ministers in Brussels.
I could not pluck up the courage to speak to her; merely to gaze. In
truth, there was not all that much to ogle behind those huge sunglasses,
tangled blonde thatch and wraparound collar. Keeping quiet and merely
looking was, in retrospect, a good decision. A less inhibited German
colleague -- a woman -- had no such qualms.
''Miss Bardot,'' she squealed as she elbowed her way through the crowd
for a glimpse. ''Oh Miss Bardot. I was your greatest fan. I admire all
your movies, I love all your work. And now I have the chance to meet you
in person. I thought it would never happen. Oh, Miss Bardot, I hope you
don't mind me just speaking to you. It is so wonderful to meet you at
last . . . ''
La Bardot must have suffered this a million times. She listened
patiently and then she peered expressionlessly, from behind the shades,
at my exuberant colleague, looking her up and down. In the sexiest voice
imaginable, she replied softly: ''Why ees eet you are wearing zat
orrible fur coat?''
Despite the noise, and the numbers at the demo, and William
Waldegrave's incitement to protesters to carry on the good work in
Britain's interest, the impression remains that the veal crate and
animal transport issues are mainly an English (as opposed to British)
concern. Brigitte Bardot, for her part, sees this protest as a means of
bringing the campaign to France.
Among the demonstrators in Brussels were some carrying banners with
the flag of St George on it, which is unusual these days. Most English
demonstrators in my Brussels experience are like well-behaved versions
of soccer fans. They regard the Union Jack as English, not British,
property.
Most EU Continental countries have shown some mild sympathy for the
demonstrations begun at the English ports. The death of an activist in
Coventry had an effect on this side of the channel, and brought the
issue to prominence in the media. In other, mainly southern, states,
however, there is resentment at the idea of the EU being coerced by
eccentric British animal lovers into changing long-established rules.
Some could be forgiven for thinking the EU has its priorities wrong.
Which is more cruel -- raising calves for a few months in crates, or
torturing cattle to death in a bullring? The animal welfare debate in
Europe is a confused affair and nothing is more mysterious than the
sudden enthusiasm in southern England for the issues of veal crates and
transport of live animals. There is not much of an echo in Wales or
Scotland, or even Ireland where human rights still bring louder support
than animal rights.
SOME curiosity about what has motivated this phenomenon is being
voiced in Europe. One theory -- which I share -- is that it is really
little more than another expression of the growing distrust of the EU in
the south of England; animal welfare is simply another conduit for
getting at ''Brussels'' and all its works.
This trend is fuelled by the Tebbits of this world, whose Europhobia
is now becoming cranky to the point of racism. To suggest, as Lord
Tebbit did, that the EU is now comparable with the apartheid regime in
the old South Africa is an affront to the millions who suffered in that
country for generations. Can you imagine the reaction in Britain if
Europeans said we were like old-time South African white neo-fascists?
And now we have Willy Wally in Brussels encouraging protests against
EU law, while old stagers like Tebbit are beginning to chunter on about
campaigns of civil disobedience. If this is the best our political
leadership can come up with is it any wonder the tide of public opinion,
in the Tory heartlands of England, is beginning to turn against Europe?
This creeping misanthropy is encouraged by a politically lopsided
London press which conditions its readers to regard the EU as little
more than a foreign conspiracy. The effect is even beginning to be felt
in Scotland, which must be the most pro-European nation in Europe,
probably because we have no sovereignty left to lose. A recent System
Three opinion poll in The Herald suggested suspicion of Brussels is
growing, and I have no doubt the same applies in pro-European Wales.
This is all part of a process which is encouraged, for ignoble
internal party reasons, by the British Government, riven by Europe, as
it seeks to save its electoral skin where the need is greatest -- in the
south of England. I predict we shall next see this week's turmoil in the
channel ports being turned against the EU. Of course, the blame for this
unrest lies with the English-based ship-owners who are ignoring a local
workforce in favour of cheap Polish labour. It is the ultimate use of
the freedom employers have won in recent years to do anything they wish
now that the unions are defeated.
No-one will immediately point out that, if Britain had signed the
Social Chapter of Maastricht, our employers would have found more
difficulty in embracing social dumping in the first place.
It is now becoming time to be frank about Britain's faltering role in
Europe: English, Tory Europhobia has made our Government a national
embarrassment. Many British people in Brussels, English included, will
tell you so openly. The English nationalists who threaten British
participation in the EU are a menace which must be challenged.
Which Government leader has the courage to speak for the British
majority, and damn the consequences?

Clare Henry investigates claims that the Scottish National Gallery
stands aloof from international enthusiasm for the output of Scottish
print workshops.
SCOTTISH printmaking? Dire. Scottish print workshops? Dire. Scottish
contemporary art? Dire. These are the signals sent out by the Scottish
National Gallery of Modern Art and its director Richard Calvocoressi.
Ignoring Scottish work, unless mediated by London promoters and
dealers, profoundly affects what the Scottish public sees. While our
print workshops have established an international reputation,
Calvocoressi stands aloof in his ivory tower. He has never bought a
single thing from Glasgow Print Studio, Dundee or Edinburgh Printmakers,
nor does he visit, or give moral support to, the workshops.
''Neither Calvocoressi nor his deputy Keith Hartley have ever been to
Aberdeen's Peacock Printmakers,'' its director Arthur Watson told me
yesterday on the phone from Germany where he is installing over 400
prints. ''Their total purchase over 21 years is a solitary Bellany print
about seven years ago. I took them a pile of work but Calvocoressi said:
'We've made a big commitment to Charles Booth-Clibborn and that about
covers it'.''
The GMA has just launched an exhibition of Clibborn's Paragon Press
publications: 250 prints by more than 40 leading British artists from 35
projects (only five printed in Scotland) as a major event titled
Contemporary British Art in Print 1986-95.
''Over the past 10 years we've acquired most of these projects. It's
this collection which is the stimulus to the present exhibition and
accompanying catalogue,'' says Calvocoressi. The lavish catalogue, which
cost #40,000 to produce and is selling at #17.95 (#22.50 after the
exhibition), illustrates all 496 Paragon prints and (despite its errors)
is ''set to become a standard reference work''.
''I hope they'll do the same for us, but I doubt it,'' commented John
Mackechnie, director of Glasgow Print Studio, and, like Watson, used to
the GMA's cold shoulder.
Robert Adam, director of Edinburgh Print Makers, goes further. ''It's
a disgrace. Scottish public money is being used to promote a privately
owned commercial London enterprise which now focuses entirely on English
artists; give it the stamp of approval and provide a catalogue as a
selling tool for Clibborn to use world-wide.
''The catalogue reads like a Festschrift: 'The major print publisher
of our times; the finest, most remarkable print projects this century.'
What ridiculous hype! The catalogue is also inaccurate -- and proves how
ignorant the GMA is about Scottish print workshops. They began in 1967,
not 1973. They are not co-operatives. Beth Fisher did not merely edition
Night of Islands -- she generated it. Other names and dates are wrong.
History has been re-written to the greater glory of Clibborn's Paragon
Press.''
Irony of ironies, the original plan was to exclude the four Scottish
sets from the GMA show entirely, merely exhibiting them in Edinburgh
University's Talbot Rice Gallery. And even these four sets didn't make
any money for the artists. Explains Ken Currie: ''The GMA bought
entirely via Clibborn.''
Of his acclaimed Story from Glasgow, printed in Cumbria, Currie says:
''I got no money. We split the edition 50-50. Both Kelvingrove and GMA
bought from Clibborn. He sold his half to key collectors and museums --
covered the ground. I'm stuck with my half cluttering up the studio.
There's no-one left to sell to. You'd think local museums would have the
sense to buy from the artist.''
Clibborn is to be congratulated for the way he has hooked the GMA. I
admire his enterprise which goes hand in hand with terrific energy,
dedication, and an endearing personality. Moreover, his genuine
enthusiasm has encouraged both artists and printers to produce some of
their best work. As middle-man he is superb. Single-handed, working from
home, he has instigated prime collaborations. Paragon Press may sound
big but it's a one-man band.
However, by embracing his productions wholeheartedly, the GMA has
totally excluded Scotland's print studios. This is wrong. As Watson
says: ''Charles has done a lot, but that doesn't absolve the GMA of its
responsibilities.''
Charles is the son of Edward Booth-Clibborn, for 30 years a leading
publisher of books on graphics, illustration, and design and founder of
the British, European, and American Design Annuals. John Tomlinson, head
of graphics at Glasgow, explains: ''You submit work to his annuals and
if selected, pay him. For designers it's a way of advertising --
bringing your work to the attention of art directors and clients.''
Charles learnt well at his father's knee. Armed with his publisher's
silver spoon, while still an Edinburgh University history student he
visited curators, dealers, librarians, and publishers in Rome, New York,
and on America's West Coast. Back in London this fully-fledged prodigy
leapt straight into publishing, launching the Scottish Bestiary (still
one of his best projects) at Whitehall's palatial Banqueting Hall in
October 1986.
Clibborn swims with the tide. He began his enterprise with fashionable
figurative Scots like Wiszniewski, Currie, Howson, and Alan Davie in the
1980s and continued with Le Brun's etchings (price #19,000) and
Gormley's Body &amp; Soul (#3500). Now he commissions fashionable 1990s
monochromatic minimalists such as Rachel Whiteread, Alan Charlton, Lisa
Milroy, and Damien Hirst. The show is worth a visit to look back at the
Glasgow Boys and see the current crop of cool, clinical -- even arid --
conceptualists.
Originally text played a vital and integral role in his limited
editions. George Mackay Brown wrote the poems for Clibborn's first
portfolio. Will Maclean spent almost as long assembling his 10 poems as
drawing the images.
Nowadays text is increasingly ignored, while hi-tech print methods are
pursued. John Hilliard's 1990 Seven Monoprints (#3000) employs
photomontage printed via Scanachrome. Grenville Davey's 1993
screenprints of a glass eye and glass stopper utilised
computer-generated images, the photos transferred to AppleMac and then
computer analysed with Acute Focusing, Gauzian Blur techniques, and
digitised colour separations. ''Letterpress is expensive. It's cheaper
and quicker to do without,'' observes Watson.
The GMA's annual acquisitions budget is #110,000 from a Scottish
National Galleries total of #1.17m, which has just been cut by
half-a-million. (English museums remain the same. Is Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang less of a fighter, or is he questioning buying policy?)
Calvocoressi can spend various sums of #10,000 on his own authority.
Over that he has to clear it with his director. So how much has he spent
with Clibborn? ''When one is buying from dealers, it's a special
price,'' is all he would say.

THE FOURTH INSTINCT
By Arianna Huffington
Piatkus, #14.99
BY October 19, 1994, according to the Federal Election Commission,
candidates and parties in the US mid-term elections had spent close to
$700m on either insults, lies, soundbites or promises.
In California alone $36m had been squandered, $28m of it the personal
fortune of the Mr Michael Huffington, the Texas oil millionaire who
attempted to win the California seat with a campaign of unparalleled,
moral vacuity. Huffington espoused the novel view that his job in
Washington, if chosen, would be to ''do nothing''.
It is against this backdrop of political mugging, that the life of
Michael's wife, Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington, unwinds; the
socialite and Cambridge-educated author known for her controversial
books on Maria Callas and Picasso (she labelled him a sadistic
wife-beater), is even more newsworthy.
She has written a book called The Fourth Instinct, subtitled The Call
Of The Soul, an apology to God on behalf of mankind.
The novel is an attempt to explain the first human instinct after sex,
power, and survival, an instinct which is not ever, even in 248 pages,
defined. We gather it is vaguely connected to some kind of spiritual
hunger. Indeed, Mrs Huffington, a former MSIA minister (the Movement for
Spiritual Inner Awareness, a New Age cult whose leader allegedly
believes himself more powerful than Christ) has contributed $35,000 to
New Age religious groups as recently as 1992.
Arianna is quite a gal. She crashed New York society in record time.
Vanity Fair contend she ambitiously masterminded her husband's, albeit
unsuccessful, political gambit. Arianna, 44, was even quoted in Esquire
as defending her husband's campaign financing. ''What amazes me is that
if Michael had spent $5m buying a very inferior Picasso, nobody would
blink an eye-lid. That's what people with money are supposed to do,''
she said.
Arianna's idiosyncratic, kangaroo logic dominates The Fourth Instinct,
a coffee-table Bible. It is a turgid testimony to a pet subject -- moral
philosophy.
Stassinopoulis scribbles as she allegedly talks; with utter
conviction. Once described by the Guardian's Michael White, a decade or
so ago, as ''the most upwardly mobile Greek since Icarus'', the book
too, stinks of being some kind of panacea for a wealthy life.
Arianna's orbit is governed by the pursuit of power. This novel is a
claim for integrity in a world diseased by grasping politics and cult
religion. The basic premise of the book is that society is decaying,
morally and materially, because of a lack of spiritual exercise.
Arianna, like many self-styled gurus, punts a new-age Christianity, a
permutation of the original. She fancies herself as a swami. She
maintains that people need to find purpose in their lives, ''meaning,
transcendence, wholeness and truth''. Basically, she's saying, that if
we all loved one another, life would be a splendid vacation. I'd say!
Huge pronouncements are dropped casually, into long, self-indulgent
chunks of a highbrow, pseudo-debate on man's struggle against his
nature, such as: ''Worry is a form of atheism. And so is fear''.
The psycho-babble is extraordinary: ''(And . . . ) if there is no such
thing as human nature, there is no such thing as moral sense, and then
no one way of being and behaving is better than any other -- at least,
not in the absolute sense''. Yes, the subject is vague and the impetus
for such a book completely and utterly banal. I'm not going to patronise
anybody by paying any attention to the finale, a call for the more
(allegedly) spiritually aware to unite and take charge of man's
evolution; snobby, new-age claptrap.
Before Huffington married Arianna, his record in the House was skimpy
to the point of invisibility. He managed to vote both for and against on
issues like crime and abortion and the core of his message (perhaps more
accurately Arianna's message) was that federal welfare programmes should
be replaced by altruism and private charity.
Arianna and her husband, it seems, are, by their millions, able to buy
a place in what they regard as the most important playground of all --
the Senate and the Church.
Any grey matter the Huffingtons may have shared has been corrupted by
silliness; that, or the lack of a hard day's graft. In this sense,
ordinary people should unite, in their commonsense, and refuse to buy
this book in order to prevent a gross insult to theirs.

WELL, it certainly seems to me we should all be jolly grateful to that
nice John Major taking so much time out to come up here in person and
explain to us in such detail about Scotland and Scottish history and
what's good for us and all.
Heavens to Betsy, what a right old muddle it could be if this country
didn't have the constant blessing of Conservative Prime Ministers
prepared to lift their eyes from internecine warfare within their own
ranks and travel the kingdom to reassure the natives.
Why, some of us are old enough to remember the blessed Edward Heath
addressing the faithful in Perth and explaining to them and the eager
media how Conservatives believed in devolution and local responsibility
and how when he came to power this belief would be made flesh in a
Scottish Assembly. For this was still 1968, and Labour was then enjoying
one of its brief flirtations with power.
In the event Mr Heath proved to have a couple of other things on his
mind when he got the keys to No 10, and what with the miners' dispute
and three-day weeks and Patrick Jenkin rallying the nation to clean its
teeth in the dark, Scottish politics somehow slipped down the
post-electoral agenda. As they so often do.
But 1979 brought another golden opportunity for Prime Ministerial
wisdom on the subject. Former Premier Alec Douglas-Home wheeled himself
out of retirement to advise the Scots on the perils of accepting the
Labour Government's plans for devolution. Don't have any truck with this
half-baked scheme, warned the erstwhile earl. Beware of cheap
imitations. Don't be tempted by the absurdity of an assembly which can't
even raise revenues. Stick with the Tories, and we'll deliver the real
thing.
And then came Herself. And if we felt we'd been shortchanged on advice
before, there was little fear of a dearth of the stuff throughout the
next dozen years. She might have handbagged her way round Europe and
back, but she was never too busy to hit the trail north and explain how
self-government was a fantasy fuelled by extremists.
The only devolution which mattered was the freedom to look after No 1.
Who could forget these teutonic rallies in douce Perth with the town
hall subjected to ever higher and bluer backdrops, the platform stiff
with tartan Tories in serried pinstriped ranks, the streets awash with
Special Branch, and Madame Angleterre at the rostrum giving it laldy?
Sometimes, on less formal occasions, she would let us know how much
she was really one of us. ''What matters to us in Scotland,'' she would
trill to startled interviewers. Or ''of course for we Scots.'' Yet
somehow, inexplicably, the notion of Grantham's finest as a soulmate of
Robbie the Pict never quite seized the popular imagination. She must
have known as much, but it didn't ever dent her enthusiasm for assuming
honorary Scottish citizenship. Maybe it's the woad she fancies.
So let's just see now. That's one Tory PM for a Scottish Assembly. One
Tory PM for an Assembly so long as it has decent powers and some proper
teeth, and two Tory PMs having none of any of it -- so far, so
confusing.
And round the edges of all this we have an assortment of senior
Conservatives, Messrs Lang and Rifkind to name but two, who were dead
keen on devolution and subsequently not. Then again, taking a
diametrically opposed view on such matters to the PM of the day is
rarely a fast track to promotion.
Which brings us neatly to the Prime Minister of the day. The
uncharitable among us might suppose Mr Major's insatiable enthusiasm for
railing against Scottish self-determination has its genesis in the
darker hours before the last election. Then, when even the loyalists
were predicting electoral meltdown in Scotland, the Conservatives
managed not just to hold on to their seats but pick up a couple along
the road. Not only the bookies had well-smacked jobs.
Popular mythology in Conservative circles puts this Lazarus-like
performance down to Mr Major's last-minute speech in stout defence of
the UK Union. Though it's always puzzled this commentator how the Tories
square the theory that this one issue swayed the electorate with their
other tenet of psephological faith that devolution does not much excite
the lieges on the doorstep. Either we care desperately about
constitutional change or we don't give much of a toss. But you can't
argue both propositions.
Though as it happens I am not among the uncharitable. I really do
think John Major got as near as he'll ever come to passion when he told
a Glasgow audience on Friday night that he would defend to the death the
''integrity'' of the Union. The man patently means it. And he is
entitled to his vision of Britain and welcome to tell us about it.
He is not entitled to assume it is the only valid template for the
governance of Britain, nor to dismiss the alternative visions of
three-quarters of Scotland. And to round off his speech with a homily
about what he would and wouldn't ''let'' the Scots do or think smacks of
arrogance of near Thatcherian proportions.
The party line now is that John Major is not deaf to the wishes of the
Scots, merely warning them of the possible consequences of following any
path but his. Merely setting out the parameters of a more well-informed
debate. Well, fine. But a debate, by definition, does not begin or
flourish with one of the participants chiselling out his final
conclusions on tablets of immutable stone.
The problem is that those Scots to whom John Major may listen hardly
qualify as a representative sample of opinion. Remember the famous
''stocktaking breakfast'' where an almost all-male, almost all-Tory,
entirely establishment group was wheeled in to Bute House?
On a good week that sort of group represents about 16% of Scots. As it
happens, a fair number of them live in the constituency of Perth and
Kinross. But not perhaps enough to return a Tory MP in a by-election. If
not, we may yet see some interesting changes in the PM's Scottish
script.

Douglas Thompson talks to the Queen Predator of the silver screen in
the 1990s, Demi Moore, about her irresistible rise to stardom.
WHEN the disquieting Demi Moore found international fame in the
out-of-this-world fantasy romance, Ghost, her image was white tee-shirt,
girl-next-door, cropped hair, neat smile, and big, grey eyes on a fresh
face, and not much evidence of hips or waist. She was demure. And
unthreatening. Now, she's Wonderbra woman.
Since she had phallic fun playing with clay in supernatural, and
successful, Ghost, she's flashed a sculpted and daily -- three hours a
day, every day, after the birth of her children -- exercised body, on
and off screen, in some sensational photographs. Coy is not in her
vocabulary.
In today's Hollywood, she is The Body. And the boss. Few stars have
worked so hard -- and successfully -- to present the image they want. Ms
Moore made public appearances squeezed into gowns, which emphasised that
all the bits are in all the right places.
Her look, her attitude, could set-off fire alarms and spark loin
alerts. It brought her attention and, from this month, $8m a film. This
is Nicholson/Cruise/Costner financial country -- Meryl Streep, who would
be lost in a Wonderbra, still earns the comparatively meagre sum of $3m
a movie.
This wily, one-time, wide-eyed Brat Packer is, it seems, totally in
control. She's also the silver screen's Queen Predator of 1995. The
actress has an off-camera reputation for being ''assertive'' and going
after everything she wants with a passion.
She doesn't regard that as a criticism, but a compliment. It is her
nature to shoot for the bullseye. She admits she does not hold back. It
won her showy roles in A Few Good Men (as a tough, Navy legal officer
opposite Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson) and Indecent Proposal (as the
wife whom Robert Redford offers $1m to bed). Her mantra is the secular
''if-you-don't-ask-you-don't-get.''
Which is somewhat ironic, because in Disclosure, which is becoming the
first box-office giant of the year, she doesn't so much ask as grab. And
that, surprisingly, still doesn't work on real-life sex-addict Michael
Douglas, who, in Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct, was not exactly
reticent in bedroom games.
However, this is 1995 stuff. Best-selling author Michael Crichton's
book, and the movie taken from it, are asking who really is the boss in
today's hi-tech workplace. Surveys say that by the next century women
will rule in the corporate jungle. So who's wolf-whistling now? Already
Crichton and others argue that nudge-nudgery and ogling will no longer
be an exclusively male prerogative. And, in keeping with her track
record, Demi Moore is the first to take things by the . . . well, you
know what, literally and figuratively in Disclosure.
The dimple-faced Douglas plays Tom Sanders, a married computer
executive, who believes he is going to get the next big promotion. He
doesn't. His former girlfriend -- Moore as Meredith Johnson -- gets the
job. And she wants to rekindle past affection. He doesn't. She accuses
him of sexual harassment. It's all sex, lust and, of course, lawyers. It
may be soapy and silly, but you can't stop watching. It's clearly
another box-office bonanza for Moore.
On March 9 she plans to be in Las Vegas to accept an award, as Female
Star of the Year 1995, from the owners of America's major cinema chains.
The moguls are happy that Moore's past three films have earned them more
than $100m in America alone. Disclosure, with the sexually aggressive
Moore, appears at present about to double that figure. For them she is
not just an uplifted but uplifting woman.
As Michael Douglas's tormentor in Disclosure she is as lethal and
cunning as one of the creatures from Crichton's Jurassic Park -- only
the animals have been changed to protect the innocent. As Douglas's boss
she wants him in the office, and in bed. In fact, she wants him
anywhere. Her determination to get her prey makes T-Rex look like a
cuddly toy.
If you thought Michael Douglas had problems with Glenn Close in Fatal
Attraction, then wait till you see him as the lust object of
harridan/harasser Meredith Johnson. The Royal Mounted Police should
adopt her as their new mascot, for Moore plays a lady who will always
get her man.
''Don't you think I was perfect casting?'' she asks with a light
laugh. In real life she did get her man, but rather more romantically.
Bruce Willis was so overcome by her that he flew her to Las Vegas for a
''surprise'' wedding. Half a dozen years, and two children, later they
are one of Hollywood's few stable power couples. They share the chores,
the kids, but have separate film production companies. In Hollywood,
love is having his and her hit movies. At present she's ahead of her
Die-Hard action man, who won rave reviews for his part in Pulp Fiction.
Ms Moore can cope with fame and family but still wants more. ''I just
want the end result of things to be the highest quality they can be. I
want good work, I want things to be the best they can be. I want
greatness.''
Well, you can't knock ambition. So far she's had a good run of movies.
Her children, Rumer Glenn, five, and Scout La Rue, three, are given
every consideration. She's proved it possible to juggle motherhood, a
high-profile celebrity marriage, and superstardom.
Her daughter, Rumer (named after British novelist Rumer Godden, author
of the Black Narcissus) was born, not in some trendy Hollywood hospital,
but in the tiny town of Paducah, Kentucky. Bruce Willis was on location
there. He had arranged with the film company to have his pregnant wife
with him on location, and have the best facilities available for the
birth -- which he videotaped.
Even Willis's superstar clout and negotiating talents, pale against
his wife's. She has a reputation for being unrelenting in pursuit of
what she wants. When she produced the movie-thriller Mortal Thoughts
three years ago, she cast Willis as the abusive husband of a friend of
her character.
''I don't think we'll work together often, but if something like that
comes up it's silly not to do it. Bruce really responded to the
character -- and it made it easier for the family to be together,'' she
said.
Her attitude is that the family that stars together stays together. In
California-speak she attempts to explain: ''I'm very embracing, very
maternal, and I think I'm a grounding force, a centre that I provide for
Bruce. But we, together, have created a tremendous foundation of a
family. I have been through and come out of that as an example, a light
of sorts . . . a light of possibilities. Almost in the same way, there
was an embracing and reassuring of values that Bruce gave me that no-one
had ever given me before.
''Bruce made me feel important. That filled me with a strength to step
forward with a courage that, if I stepped a bit further, I knew I wasn't
going to fall. And if I fell it wasn't going to be quite as hard.
''It's very easy for me to see what I've got, and where I've come
from. But you know. You don't know. I can be OK, and know what I've got
today, but what's going to happen next year, what's going to happen in
1996? I don't like to think too far in advance. Maybe I'm superstitious,
afraid that what I've got may go away.
''But I'm not cautious about what I'm doing. I plough ahead like
there's no tomorrow.''
Moore is building an amazing celluloid portfolio. She has completed
Scarlet Letter, based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic American novel --
with Britain's Gary Oldman as her co-star -- and is, at present, in
Georgia filming A Gaslight Addition, a movie which she is also producing
that explores the dreams and dramas of a group of girls growing-up, with
her friend and co-star Melanie Griffiths.
She got $5m for Disclosure -- Michael Douglas was paid $12m -- but has
an even more lucrative situation with Striptease for which she is being
paid $8m to star as Erin Grant in the film version of the Carl Hiassen
book.
Is she worth it? ''I think that my main strength is that I'm very
accessible and I've had an openness in a lot of the characters I have
played that's inviting to people. I'm kind of a plain Jane. That's my
strength. I feel somewhat limited by my own experiences -- I'm getting
much better at asking questions when I don't know things, whereas when I
was younger I was too terrified to even say I didn't know things,
because I felt if I said that it would be all over.
''The reality is that I feel I'm good but I'm not great.
''I have the potential to maybe do some really great things, but I
don't feel like I'm extremely gifted. There's a part of me that just
thinks, 'Well, I have something. I don't know what it is, or why it
works, but I'm happy that it does. Because I really like doing what I
do.' And I know there is a part of me that can convey real, honest
emotion and affect people.''
She admits no horizons. ''You never run out of goals -- not unless you
want to stop really living.
''There are people who are happy to stay within parameters, but for me
that would never be enough.''
Asked about her role models, she offers Katharine Hepburn and Susan
Sarandon. Hepburn, well, for being Hepburn. Sarandon? ''I think she's
laid the groundwork (and some others) for those of us who are coming up
to trying to find important characters in later life.''
But at present, the big screen has Ms Moore with her wonderful breasts
elevated by her Wonderbra enticing Michael Douglas to make her day --
and her afternoon and evening. And the coffee.
Does this really happen in corporate America?
Her long, black hair spilling over her shoulders, the no longer demure
Ms Moore simply smiles and then says, ''It's our turn now.''

WE are faced again on Wednesday night with this scenario: Mr Major
defeated by intransigent rebels and Ulster Unionists. This would be
followed by another confidence motion, and an immediate General Election
if the Government lost that too.
This is a scenario, not a probability. But it cannot be ruled out
because, when voting is tight, accidents can happen, and a result
produced that was not necessarily desired at the time. The Prime
Minister has increased the stakes by choosing to intervene himself.
The issue, provoked by Mr Blair, is whether Mr Major's European policy
is wrong and against the interests of the nation. That is his
proposition, carefully worded to unite his own side on the night, and to
tempt others to support him for whatever reason.
The Government is expected to table an amendment in the next 48 hours
to the effect that it is Labour's European policy that is wrong and
against the interests of the nation. A true outcome on Wednesday night,
reflecting the ambiguities on both Tory and Labour benches, might be
some kind of a draw.
Tory rebels, for example, might imagine that a confidence motion and
the threat of a General Election can be avoided if they defeat the
Labour motion, but cause the Government amendment to fail as well.
Commons' Standing Order No 30 (paras 2a and 2b) appear to prevent this
possibility.
This obliges The Speaker to rule that Mr Blair's main motion would
''be agreed to'' even if it had been voted down, if the amendment had
been voted down also. So Tory rebels, or disaffected Ulster Unionists,
cannot finagle a ''draw'' situation. They will have to concentrate on
the vote on the Labour motion, which is taken first in these
circumstances.
Labour solidarity in the Commons on Wednesday night belies the fact
that the divisions within Labour are, if anything, greater than those on
the Tory side. Up to 60 dissidents have been careful, so far, not to
thwart their party's desire for office, although they have defied their
whip on occasions. In Government, however, it can be predicted that Mr
Blair will face even more problems than Mr Major.
It suits him to embarrass the Prime Minister on Europe at every
opportunity, so long as he doesn't have to commit himself to a single
currency, ''federalism'' or a referendum in the meantime. This would
force his own rebels out into the open, a prospect that Mr Major has
been trying to encourage.
There are up to 30 Tory Euro-sceptics (nine of them currently off the
Whip) of varying degrees of rebelliousness. You find them mainly on the
right wing of the party. On the Labour side, there are about 60 sceptics
spread across the spectrum, from right to hard-left.
They include the following: Peter Shore, John Evans, Andrew Mackinlay,
Kate Hoey, Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner, Bernie Grant, Denzil Davies,
Austin Mitchell, Peter Hain and Roger Berry. They were not at all keen
when the party's manifesto for the European elections last year stated
that Labour ''accepts the policy of a single currency''.
Robin Cook has since taken over as Shadow Foreign Secretary and put
some qualifications to that manifesto statement. As long as Mr Blair has
the luxury of being in Opposition he has little difficulty in presenting
a united stance. But in Government, with decisions to take, Cabinet
divisions would emerge to match those on the backbenches.
Each would feed the other. Mr Blair, in Mr Major's place, would find
it even harder to provide what he now requires of Mr Major, firm
leadership not tossed about by party divisions. The Labour Whip was
defied in 1993 by 59 rebels who voted against the Maastricht Bill in
principle. Last November, 40 insisted on trying to kill the European
Finance Bill at the Second Reading. A few days ago, despite the fact
that both Labour and the Tories were trying to turn a Liberal Democrat
motion on a referendum into an inconsequential outcome, 18 Labour
backbenchers went their own way.
At the bottom of the Labour concern is the prospect of a Blair
Government handing over control of interest rates and the currency to
Europe. Furthermore, they see a danger that the European Union will move
to generalising tax rates. With these three levers of economic power
gone from London, what chance of being a proper Socialist government?
Those on the Labour side who think this way are every bit as sincere
about national sovereignty as are the Tory rebels. It is just that, at
this stage in the drive for power, they are as anxious as Mr Blair to
get the Tories out, with no strings attached.
Labour Europhiles, some of whom believe that the concept of the nation
state is dead, share this priority. In power, both sides of the argument
would wish to attach the strings and that's where Mr Blair's troubles
would begin. A few Tories convince themselves, from time to time, that
it would be worth losing the next election in order to hasten the day
when they could unite to exploit Labour splits.
Reflection, customarily, reverses such a view. Indeed, there are
signs, as indicated by Mr Nicholas Budgen in The Herald today (see Page
9)that the Tory rebels will be supporting their Government on Wednesday
night. They don't like Mr Major's European policy, but they believe that
Labour's is worse. They will play hard to get, until the voting takes
place.
They seem to think that Mr Major will be able to say something to them
that will please them sufficiently to support him on this occasion
which, after all, has nothing to do with Government legislation. Sir
Teddy Taylor, in his capacity as unofficial spokesman for the rebels,
seemed to be offering a compromise yesterday.
So far the Euro-sceptics have been demanding a referendum before
Britain joins a single currency. Yesterday Sir Teddy was gearing this
down to a pledge that Parliament would be guaranteed a specific vote on
the issue before a formal or informal decision was made. Mr Major should
have no difficulty with this since he has always insisted that
Parliament would decide on further political or monetary union.
Full support from the rebels on Wednesday night on the basis of such a
compromise, might pave the way for them to return to the Whip, honours
even. The rebels may feel that they are about to achieve all they can by
staying off the Whip, particularly as the Cabinet seems to be adhering
to an individual vow of silence on Europe.
This is the more likely outcome of Wednesday night, whether or not a
confidence motion turns out to be necessary (who knows what the Ulster
Unionists will do at this stage?). So Mr Blair may have the luxury of
Opposition and a seemingly united party for a while longer.

THE phone still rings about the column moving from Tuesday to Monday.
Yes, in a rearrangement of features, I did change days; but no, I wasn't
moving house, as one dear lady seemed to think, while offering some
advice about the flitting.
I remain in that southern suburb of Glasgow where I have spent more
than half my life, a community well defined by river, railway, and golf
course, retaining the flavour of a village while blessed with easy
access to the city.
It is the best of both worlds, with kirk and school as focal points
and sundry characteristics, including a cafe with the best ice-cream in
Glasgow.
Unusually last week, my attention was taken by the kirk, a place not
overburdened with my presence down the years, since I belong to that
deadwood half which turns up on Communion Sunday -- and perhaps the one
before, to lessen the shock for the minister's system.
There is no reason for this backsliding performance, other than the
laziness of shunning a good habit. Netherlee has run through 50 years of
post-war life with two of the most energetic and stimulating ministers
the Church of Scotland has produced.
So no excuse about dull sermons. The atmosphere, when you go there, is
warm and welcoming and I have never failed to feel the better of it.
There are organisations galore and the sense of community is strong. If
anything, Netherlee apologises too much for its middle-class prosperity.
Currently it is searching its soul to find weaknesses, rounding up the
members for group discussion on where it should be going on the run-in
towards the new century.
So I stole quietly along to one of the gatherings and witnessed the
serious effort of decent people to make the kirk a more relevant force
in the modern age. There was no shortage of opinion. Some wanted a less
traditional service, with more of that jaunty informality which puts
some folk at ease and makes others cringe.
Predictably on such an occasion, there was a rhetoric for change, a
call for being ready to ''move with the times'' and do more to attract
the young. Try pinning down those platitudes to specifics, however, and
you run into culs-de-sac.
I would guess the church has been changing all along. I remember, in a
pre-war world, accompanying my grandfather to the country kirk which he
scrubbed for the service with a devotion you wouldn't expect today. He
was a man of contentment, untravelled but well read about the world and
glad to be cultivating his bit land, as a daily contact with God's own
acre of poetry.
Maybe what I am saying is that, within the appealing structure of his
arcadian life, he had a strong faith, largely unspoken but confirmed on
his death-bed when I heard him whisper the line from Burns that ''A
correspondence fixed wi' Heaven is sure a noble anchor''.
But my grandfather's day has gone and much of kirk life has gone with
it. In fact there has been no shortage of revolution. It has bent this
way and that to meet the whims and calls of the voluble, from the
studied and faintly ridiculous casualness of the guitar and the woolly
jumper to a new Bible which stripped away the expressive beauty of an
enduring English and replaced it with a transient vocabulary which is
already beginning to look out of date.
All that would be justified if the Bible were more widely read and
appreciated. But is it? Has falling membership been reversed, even
arrested?
It has long been difficult to attract people to the church. More than
30 years ago, the minister of Netherlee, the glorious Stanley Mair,
hired the ice-rink at Crossmyloof of all places to stir a regeneration
of Christian spirit. The man could have done no more.
A generation later, the succeeding David Arnott is showing the same
concern and enthusiasm, albeit with a membership of 1100, which is 500
down from the ice-rink days.
The commitment within the church has not changed. But society has.
Parental influence is a pale shadow, increasingly impotent in an age of
godlessness and selfishness. Two fingers to the world. Do your own
thing.
I think we are skating round the edges. The unpalatable fact, for
Netherlee and elsewhere, is that God is out of fashion, reduced to an
optional extra, even by cranky clerics.
In reality, people tend to seek religious experience mainly when they
feel the need for it. They come with bereavement, for example, and go
when it fades.
Most of all, they come with the years. For the inevitable fate of the
young, if they are lucky, is that they will grow old -- and there is
nothing wrong with old age except that it doesn't last long enough.
But the closer we come to our maker, the more we are inclined to
acknowledge His existence. At the worst, hedging our bets, we prefer the
possible oblivion of a believer to the stammygaster which awaits the
atheist if the hereafter turns out to be a reality.
At Netherlee they are at least checking the compass for the voyage
ahead.

IT has been reported that campaigning must cease on the part of an
influential Scottish pensioners' organisation otherwise its funding as a
registered charity is endangered.
Apparently the Inland Revenue regards campaigning as being
incompatible with charitable status. This effectively silences any
direct criticism of any named political party by any pensioner
organisation, or indeed any organisation similarly funded which purports
to speak for the disadvantaged in Scottish society and is a registered
charity.
This distinction in itself raises another important question. How
many, if any, pensioner or other such organisations have an independent
voting right or executive voice in the deliberations or policies of the
Scottish political parties?
It would be difficult to find many dissatisfied disadvantaged within
the ranks of the Conservative and Unionist Party.
But where in the televised annual conferences of the Opposition
parties within Scotland do you see card votes on behalf of varied
socialist pensioner organisations, speakers on behalf of elderly
groupings of the Liberal Democrats, or of Nationalist pensioners for
independence?
There are, quite rightly, Young Socialists, Young Liberals, and Young
Scots, trade union groups , etc, all up there on the platforms but
seldom, if ever, any speakers for various party organisations from
within the 900,000 pensioners of Scotland and other disadvantaged
citizens by right of party status.
Must pensioners and other such organisations, registered or
unregistered as charities, become independently funded and politically
independently voiced in order to wield effectively, at elections at
whatever level, their numerically tremendous and ever increasing voting
power?

IF, as Graham Walker infers (February 18), we have an entrenched
scenario where Scottish Catholics of Irish origin are against Scottish
home rule and Northern Ireland Protestants are against a united Ireland,
could the impasse be solved by an exchange of population between
Scotland and Ireland on a voluntary basis?
Those who have a personal yearning for Ireland could return there and
the Irish who feel Scottish could return to Scotland.
This course of action could save a lot of money, end bigotry in the
West of Scotland and, most important of all, stop our Irish cousins
murdering one another.
I also suggest that those Scots who proclaim they would not live in an
independent Scotland should emigrate now rather than later.
Scotland, being the most under-populated country in Europe, should
then seek to become a truly multi-cultural society by inviting
immigrants from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds worldwide.

YOU printed a report on Norwegian minke whaling by Elizabeth Buie
which correctly pointed out that opposition to Norwegian minke whaling
is often led by Britain (February 11).
Britain's view is that the killing methods employed involve an
unacceptable degree of suffering. ''The British delegation (to meetings
of the International Whaling Commission) will not be swayed from that
view by Norwegian claims that deer culling, fox hunting and British
slaughterhouse methods are also cruel,'' she wrote.
She seems to be implying that the Norwegians admit that their whaling
is cruel but are defending themselves by saying that others are no
better. I very much doubt that she heard such testimony during her visit
to the fishing village of Reine.
What we tried to express was that we welcome the debate on the ethical
aspect of whaling, and that we are prepared to be judged on the basis of
accepted standards for humane killing in other hunts in other Western,
industrialised countries.
We believe that the minke whale hunt is well within such standards.
All available evidence indicates that the killing methods employed in
the minke whale hunt are more efficient and more reliable than those of
most other hunts.
There is a veterinary surgeon on board each boat, every kill is
recorded, every whaler has to take training courses and pass tests, the
percentage of wounded animals escaping is close to zero, and the average
time to death is now down to three minutes. This latter figure is about
half the equivalent time for the Norwegian moose hunt.
Comparison with other hunts in other countries is made difficult by
the lack of statistics. Britain is no exception here.
What is exceptional is the total lack of British legislation to
prevent the deliberate, outright torture of wild animals. Two youths
played football with a hedgehog, subsequently throwing it on a bonfire
-- while it was still alive. The RSPCA took the case to court, but the
perpetrators could not be convicted. There was simply nothing illegal
about it.
As we have said before, in the light of this it is rather difficult to
take seriously the British Government's criticism regarding the humane
killing aspect of Norwegian minke whaling. Britain's lack of integrity
is emphasised by its refusal to stipulate what demands a kill must meet
before it can be deemed humane.
By stating that the minke whale hunt is inhumane and that it should
therefore be banned, the British Government is in effect calling for a
ban on all hunts. That is, of course, unless it is advocating the use of
double standards.

MR ZONFRILLO disagrees with my suggestion that we should have eaten
that whale in the Clyde (February 22). His attitude is typical of those
who seem to find it easy to express concern for animals but are
indifferent to human suffering and hunger.
This sentimental attitude is responsible for one of the most shocking
wastes of resources in our country -- zoos. In a world where so many
people are starving we cannot afford the luxury of feeding the
unproductive inmates of zoos.
Surely it would go some way to helping the food situation if all the
animals in our zoos which could not be used as beasts of burden were
made use of in the pot.
Of course some of the more exotic species like chimpanzees or pandas
might be strange to our palates. But I am sure that eminent chefs would
rise to the challenge of creating some delicious recipes. A little
garlic would do wonders.

I READ Janice Webster's article on the increasing need for proficiency
in languages other than our own with great interest. It reminded me of
an experience some 20 years ago when I took a mobile marine equipment
exhibition through Scandinavia.
Our first stop was at Oslo and we started to look for the hall we had
booked. We saw two men and asked them if they could direct us, which
they did without difficulty and expressed interest in our mission,
wishing us well.
As we drove on I said to my colleague, ''Did you notice anything
unusual there, Bill?''
Bill looked blank, so I enlightened him. The two men who had given us
directions and expressed goodwill, in more than passable English, were
street sweepers.

DR DUNCAN challenges Dr Burns's contention that poor health is
poverty-related on two grounds (February 22). First, that comparisons
such as that between Sweden, with a more equitable division of wealth,
and a country like the United States, with greater inequality, are
misleading.
Why? Because Sweden ''is a small stable country with a largely
Caucasian population, whereas the US is a huge, diverse country with a
large multi-ethnic immigrant population''. In other words health is
ethnically determined and also related to population size and diversity.
There is no study to back up this bizarre theory; in so far as an
association between health and ethnic origins does exist, it can be
shown to be the outcome of the high correlation between ethnicity, on
the one hand, and poverty and deprivation on the other -- as indeed is
the case in the United States. Precisely Dr Burns's argument.
Secondly, Dr Duncan says that ''in animals, even human ones, those
that perform better usually live longer''. The measure of better
performance appears to be wealth, and, conversely, poor performance is
therefore equivalent to poverty.
This not only contradicts his earlier denial of any link between
poverty and health but overlooks the fact that the causal relationship
between the two is a two-way one: if one is poor not only is one likely
to have poor health but also if one has poor health it is going to be
more difficult to obtain, and keep, a well-paid or indeed any job.
It says that the residents of Drumchapel, who perform poorly in terms
of employment, car ownership, housing, shareholdings, and income in
comparison to those in Bearsden, have only themselves to blame both for
their underperformance and their poor health.
Taken together the two arguments, besides being contradictory and
scientifically untenable, are thinly-veiled racism and social Darwinism.

IT is clear from the Framework Document that the preferred option of
the British Government is a move towards de facto joint authority in
Northern Ireland. The establishment of the proposed north-south bodies
would make a united Ireland inevitable.
If the unionists engage in inter-party talks based upon the document,
the pressure on them by the other participants to agree to the bodies
will be immense. The threat of a resumption of violence will be used to
blackmail them into negotiating what is effectively their surrender.
Indeed it must be asked whether the entire ''peace process'' has not
been a cleverly concocted smokescreen behind which Northern Ireland
could be quietly manoeuvred out of the UK.
In the forthcoming Perth and Kinross by-election, the Conservative
Party is certain to stress its commitment to the Union. But after last
Wednesday its sense of expediency and lack of principle are almost
tangible.

BEFORE the Ulster Unionists once more say no they would do well to
consider the possibility that the rest of the UK might well be tempted
to say goodbye.
While they have the right to refuse to go down the road to a united
Ireland, they do not have a right to remain in the UK if the other
parties to that union wished to revoke it.
John Major has staked much on his Irish peace initiative. With the
rest of the political landscape fast crumbling around him, Protestant
intransigence would open up the possibility of a surefire vote-winner in
the form of a UK-wide referendum on the future of the Union. It could
just be enough to save his political neck.

THE solution to the various planning and design issues surrounding
Pacific Quay, the National Gallery of Scottish Art, and Tait's Tower is
obvious.
Tait's Tower should be relocated to Pacific Quay, the Tivoli Gardens
to Bellahouston Park, and the GDA's commerce-led proposal could be
housed within a refurbished post office building at George Square.
A regional National Gallery of Scottish Art could then be built over
the leaking flat roof at the Burrell, thus satisfying our neighbours on
the east coast, Pat Lally's desire to have something that is ''open all
year round'' on Pacific Quay, and our own self-esteem.
The only person who has been been stuffed is the architect who

Paris, Sunday
FORMER film actress Brigitte Bardot today branded French Farm Minister
Jean Puech a coward for failing to do more to help live animals
transported across Europe for slaughter.
Held back by plain clothes policemen, the 60-year-old animal rights
crusader confronted the Minister at a Paris agricultural show which she
dubbed the ''Cannes Festival'' of cattle.
''I'm not going to kill him, I just want to talk to him,'' she told
policemen as she struggled to reach the Minister between rows of cattle
at France's International Farm Show.
Bardot is backing the campaign to ensure animals in transit are
rested, fed, and watered every eight hours. EU countries failed under
France's presidency to reach agreement on the issue last week.
Bardot appealed to Puech to impose the eight-hour limit in France
without waiting for others to fall in line.
''It's not up to France to do that because the others haven't
agreed,'' the Minister told her.
Later she hit back: ''Puech only asked me to visit the fair with him
and that's all. He's a coward.''
Bardot said the 1200 animals on display at the indoor show had been
treated like film stars and that had little to do with the treatment of
live animals in container lorries.
It was, she said, like comparing the pampered superstar she once was
with the tenants of low-cost public housing.
''At the Cannes film festival there were the world's biggest movie
stars. When you go to a council house it's nothing to do with Cannes.
And this is the Cannes festival of livestock.''
The row over live animal transport has resulted in demonstrations in
Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands.
Animal campaigners particularly condemn the export of young British
calves to mainland Europe where they are reared in cramped crates to
produce tender white veal.
About 100 Bardot supporters staged a peaceful demonstration outside
the Paris farm show with banners saying: ''Veal is 100% suffering.''
Bardot, a sex symbol in the 60s, turned her back on the screen in 1973
to devote her life to animal welfare.
She set up an animal protection agency, the Brigitte Bardot
Foundation, in 1987 and sold some of her jewellery to fund it.--Reuter.

A SCHOOLBOY who went missing after running away to Malaysia with his
father's passport and credit cards, has been found safe and well, police
said yesterday.
Peter Kerry, 14, was discovered on the Malaysia-Thai border at around
noon British time -- 8pm local time. A Foreign Office spokesman said the
British High Commission was contacted by some Malaysians who said Peter
had been found. The Malaysian police contacted officers at Scotland Yard
to relay the news.
Last night, after being told his son had been found, Mr John Kerry,
59, said: ''I just thought all of a sudden it was a lovely day. I am
just so happy, not only that he has been found, but that he is alive,
safe and well.''
He added: ''I just can't express my gratitude to everybody that has
helped locate Peter.''
His son, who has a history of running away, left his home on Tuesday
after a family row and, using his father's credit cards, bought a #499
open-ended return ticket to Kuala Lumpur.
Peter, who has previously run away to Scotland and Paris, was found in
the town of Kota Baharu in the north of Peninsular Malaysia.
The town is several hundred miles from where he was sighted on
Thursday, on the Malaysia-Singapore border. On that occasion he was
turned away from a luxury hotel in Johor Barahu because he had no credit
left on his cards.
He telephoned his anxious parents John and Pat to tell them he had run
out of credit, but hotel employees were unable to find him when Mrs
Kerry called back a few minutes later.
He was also turned away when he tried to cross into Singapore. His
discovery, at the opposite end of the country, followed the publication
of his photograph in Malaysian newspapers.
The Foreign Office said he had been placed in the care of a
''responsible British national'', adding: ''He is well, but extremely
tired because of what he has been up to and because of jet lag. He's now
fast asleep.
''Arrangements will be made for him to return home after he has
rested.''
A spokesman said the High Commission was ready to provide Peter with
valid travel papers for the trip.
Peter, who likes aeroplanes and is a travel enthusiast, disappeared
after being told off for leaving the family's video collection in a mess
and spilling some spaghetti.
He was banned from going to watch an Arsenal football game on Tuesday
night, and by Wednesday morning had disappeared.
The ease with which he bought a ticket for Malaysia and passed through
customs and immigration controls, despite using his 59-year-old father's
passport, has raised questions about security levels at airports.
Malaysia Airlines, which sold him the ticket, has said it checks only
the signature on the credit card receipt and the expiry date of the
passport.
Even before Peter's discovery, his father was predicting he would be
off again before long. Mr Kerry, who works for a courier firm at
Heathrow Airport, said: ''He's a strong-willed boy and I've no doubt he
will continue to do this.''

Washington, Sunday
THE balanced budget amendment will be offered to the full Senate on
Tuesday, after six weeks' debate, and no-one knows how the vote will go.
It needs a two-thirds majority, or 67 of 100 votes, and the decision
is now in the hands of three or four Democrats who have not revealed
their intentions.
The proposal passed the House of Representatives by a wide margin, but
the Senate is different. Only one-third of its members are up for
re-election in 1996 (most of them support the amendment, which is very
popular), and senators are less amenable than Congressmen to direct
pressure from lobbyists.
They are also notoriously less disciplined. About 10 Democrats have
forsaken the party line and will support the amendment. The last,
secretive senators will make their decisions on their own, just as one
solitary Republican opposes his party's main legislative proposal.
The amendment would impose a balanced budget in 2002, or two years
after it is ratified by three-quarters of the states. Its advocates say
that this is the only way to force a hypocritical and cowardly Congress
to show fiscal responsibility. Opponents say it would impose a
straitjacket upon Congress and is therefore undemocratic.
Furthermore, in times of economic crisis, Congress would be unable to
prime the pump with deficit spending. They say the amendment is
inflicting upon the country the very fiscal policies that turned the
1929 stock market crash into the Great Depression.
Both sides have a point. The Republican majority in the House produced
some $17bn (#11bn) in savings last week, on the current budget.
That just scratches the surface. Furthermore, members from
agricultural states blocked a proposal to end the food stamps system,
which costs $27bn (#18bn) a year, and is the principal welfare subsidy
for the very poor.
One newly elected conservative Republican, Jim Bunn of Oregon, loud in
denunciation of the Democrats' wasteful ways, nevertheless succeeded in
protecting a federal subsidy of $6.5m (#4.3m) for a visitors' centre in
his district. He did so by getting his colleagues to cut a corresponding
amount from welfare projects.
All this will end if the amendment comes into effect. The president
will be obliged by law to submit a balanced budget, in 2002, and that
will mean finding cuts or tax increases worth $1.5 trillion by then. The
amendment's supporters say that living on borrowed money, as the United
States has since the 1960s, is robbing future generations -- and the
only way to stop it is to make it illegal.
What is more, a simple law won't do. In 1985, Congress passed the
Gramm-Rudman Act (named after Senator Gramm, who is running for
president) obliging Congress to balance the budget in five years.
What Congress can do, it can undo. Deficits continued unimpeded.
The balanced budget amendment was the centrepiece of the Republicans'
''Contract with America'', the programme with which they won the last
election. If it is defeated in the Senate, it will be a serious setback
for Newt Gingrich's band of reformers. If it wins those necessary 67
votes, it might even change things -- though not until the next
millennium.

CORRESPONDENCE attacking British Gas's shortcomings over its lack of
attention to servicecare customers leads me to report my recent
experience to show the other side of the coin.
The central heating system failed to operate at 7am. I phoned the BG
service number in Dundee and was promised action that day.
At 9.40am the engineer arrived, checked the system, and diagnosed a
faulty motorised valve. He phoned BG stores in Kirkcaldy and ordered a
new valve. This arrived at 10.35am.
While awaiting delivery, the engineer made other servicecare calls in
the area.
At 10.45 he returned, fitted a new part and my heating was fully
operation at 11.10am.
This I consider to be exceptional service. All praise to British Gas
and its engineer.

TORY MP Phil Gallie, was given an ovation yesterday when he told young
people at the Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr that he was completely against
drugs.
Hundreds of youngsters from all over Scotland, as well as Northern
Ireland and the North of England, took part in a ''protest dance event''
in a bid to keep the seafront club open.
The Ayr MP was cheered when he said that he was totally anti-drug.
There were more cheers when he told the dancers: ''When I was your age,
I was a rock 'n' roll fan, and I still believe that there is no music
that beats rock 'n' roll.
''Every generation has its own kind of music, and this generation has
the right to enjoy the kind of music you have now.''
Mr Gallie referred to the recently completed fatal accident inquiry
into the drug-related deaths of three patrons of the club.
He told the dancers: ''What I want you to do is kick out those who are
selling drugs and using drugs.''
Finally he urged them: ''Have a good time . . . and please don't any
of you end up in Ayr Hospital.''
Earlier Mr Gallie -- and everyone else entering the building -- was
given the kind of thorough body search that puts the ones at airports to
shame.
He wandered round the dance floor, chatting to early arrivals for the
4pm to 2am function, and then went outside to talk to others in the long
queue waiting to get in.
Club manager Fraser MacIntyre said: ''This, despite what happened,
without a shadow of doubt is the safest club in Scotland.''
Mr MacIntyre, in a T-shirt urging ''Save the Hanger'' and ''Save the
scene'', was apparently oblivious of the chill breeze off the Firth of
Clyde as he watched security men keep an eye on the queue for entry, He
said: ''We want these people to enjoy themselves. We believe we can do
it without drugs.
''These are people turning up to say 'Don't close Hanger 13 down', for
if they close us it is the end of the dance scene in Scotland.''
As the body searches went on, he declared: ''I hope there are no drugs
in tonight. That is what it is all about.''
Mr MacIntyre said the drug-related deaths last year of patrons Andrew
Dick, 19, of Glasgow, John Nisbet, 18, of New Cumnock, Ayrshire, and
Andrew Stoddart, 20, of Rigside, Lanarkshire, were an experience he
never wanted to go through again.
The dancers paid a subsidised #5 entry fee -- and were invited to make
a further contribution of up to #10 toward a fighting fund being
organised by the music magazine, M8, which had helped organise
yesterday's event.
The cash will go to fight against a perceived attempt by authority to
stamp out the kind of dancing that goes on in Hanger 13 and similar
venues.
T-shirts carrying the clarion calls ''Uniting the scene'' and ''Fight
for the right to party'' were selling like hot cakes at #5 a time.
Mr David Faulds, of M8 magazine, said: ''We don't want anyone dying.
Basically the Government has to tackle the situation.''
But he indicated his fear that heavy-handed government might go the
wrong way about things. ''If they impose a time limit on raves, I will
oppose it,'' he said.
Mr Faulds claimed: 'We have a very strong working relationship with
the police.''

WHEN Mr Morton discusses the state of the Forth Rail Bridge with
railway officials in Scotland (February 16), I suggest he does so at the
conveniently placed visitors' area at the foot of the north cantilever
tower.
From there he will be able to see for himself the many acres of
rusting steel plate which form this monument to neglect.
He will also be able to ask his staff why it is that the Royal Navy
ships in the vicinity seem to be well protected with paint: for
''cosmetic purposes'' or to deflect missiles?
Whatever pattern of maintenance may be applied to the bridge, it does
seem to be rusting away faster than it is being protected from corrosion
and its structural integrity must eventually come into question. By
which time it will be too late.
An independent survey must be commissioned.

I WAS disappointed that Deedee Cuddihy did not give a small,
independent retailer like myself the opportunity to coment before going
to press (February 17).
I like to think I give a first-class service to my customers by first
of all measuring both feet to ascertain the size and width. I would
stress, however, that this is only a guide.
Shoes are as individual as children's feet, therefore not all styles
are going to be suitable. This is where the fitter's skills and
knowledge come into play.
As far as I am aware the Which? investigation referred to was
conducted south of the Border and in my opinion was not extensive enough
to be a true reflection of the position here in Scotland.
All my customers are encouraged to return at a later date to check
that the shoes still fit. Invariably they do and return again as they
are satisfied that fitting of shoes is more important than selling.
I am pleased to say that none of my customers has found it necessary
to take a complaint to the Consumers Association. Any customer who is
unhappy with any aspect of a purchase need only return so that a
solution to the problem may be found to everyone's satisfaction and to
uphold the good name of the brand products I sell.
Any parents who take an inerest in the development of their children's
feet will continue to purchase good quality footwear from a reputable
retailer and not from High Street shops where quality and fit are not a
factor.

Copenhagen, Sunday
DENMARK is prepared to offer asylum to two Christian Pakistanis
aquitted on appeal against death sentences for blasphemy against Islam,
Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said today.
''And any problem with raising money for the plane ticket can easily
be solved,'' Petersen told Danish radio.
Salamat Masih, 14, and his uncle Rehmat Masih, 48, were acquitted by
the High Court in Lahore, last Thursday, for lack of evidence.
The two had been convicted this month after a Muslim prayer-leader
accused them of scrawling blasphemous remarks on the wall of his mosque.
Protests against the verdict by Muslim militants, some of them
demanding the deaths of the two Christians, turned into riots on Friday.
''The 14-year old Salamat Masih cannot go back to his village and it
is probably too dangerous for him to stay in Pakistan. He must be
brought to safety abroad,'' said the boy's lawyer, Hina Jilani.
There was, however, no immediate word on whether the two Christians
would leave Pakistan.--Reuter.

MOST men would like a valet. It is annoying to discover that one's
shoes need cleaning, or being unable to remember where the socks are
kept. If one does not have a chauffeur, a valet could tidy out the car
and take it to be washed. Also, he might return library books. There are
few guides to a valet's exact duties. Debrett is silent on the matter,
as is Mrs Beeton, although in 1859 she recorded that his salary was
equal to a butler, between #25 and #50 a year. Mr Ken Stronach, who
resigned recently as the Prince of Wales's valet, is said to have earned
#12,000 a year, plus a car and accommodation, so it might be possible to
get a lower-grade valet for as little as #6000. Mr Stronach already is
said to have received many offers of re-employment. In America he would
be a great talking point, of course, and probably be introduced to
guests.
A great deal has been made about what valets, butlers, etc, tell the
press, but historians say that complaining about them has been a social
pastime for five centuries. It is interesting to recall Sir William
Wentworth's advice, given in 1604. ''Take heed what you speak before
them, if you be wise, especially touching any great person,'' he wrote.
''The final end of their service is gain and advancement, which . . .
brings a dangerous temptation.'' Not long afterwards it was a Mme
Cornuel, writing to a friend, who coined the immortal phrase, ''No man
is a hero to his valet''. It is hardly surprising that Figaro, Count
Almaviva's manipulative valet, was regarded as a subversive,
revolutionary figure.
In former times a valet could work his way up from being a humble
houseboy. These days, alas, few households can afford servants at all.
At Knole, seat of the Earl of Dorset, more than a hundred servants once
sat down to dinner each day, but by 1952, when the earl's footman went
berserk with a machine gun, the number was down 40. ''It's nice to hear
of a house where you can still get a left and right at a butler,'' said
Winston Churchill. Prince Charles probably feels the same.

THOSE British banks due to roll out splendid profits this week will
give little comfort to their customers -- or employees -- but would it
be better if they made losses instead? The fate of Baring Brothers, a
famous British merchant bank with a record of particular success in the
Far East, which will be decided today, answers that question at once.
Banks may turn out to need large profits after all -- though how they
use them is quite another matter. Profits are always preferable to
losses, and the banks have been complaining that theirs is a cyclical
business in which the telephone numbers of success can just as easily be
replaced by numbers almost as large imposed by failure. Most banks hope
to enjoy prudent management but when things go wrong they do so
dramatically. Barings, who were saved from spectacular failure in Latin
America just over a century ago, have now plunged into serious trouble
in Southeast Asia.
Barings is a merchant bank, and these bodies do take risks which the
really big banks would seldom contemplate. It remains to be seen whether
Barings would really have contemplated such risks as have now been
exposed, though the bank had been particularly adept in exploiting the
derivatives markets, an area of sophisticated trading demanding cool
nerves and considerable cash flows. Its successes had been large enough
to inspire other financial institutions to trade in derivatives. But, as
has become apparent in several cases involving other, and sometimes much
larger, banks, modern technology can put extraordinary power into the
hands of strategically placed bank employees to deploy immense sums of
money into high-risk territory. Should such sorties go wrong the whole
institution can be put at risk, even though only a single officer or a
single department may have been involved.
Barings is certainly at risk and may simply be unable to survive in
its present form. Whatever the precise outcome, the bank's valuable
intangible assets, including its client base, should be saved. One other
development is unavoidable: banks everywhere will become far more leery
of trading high-risk securities in volatile international markets. The
''fun'' of derivatives is bound to be replaced by fear, and that may be
no bad thing, as the likely moves in today's markets will confirm.

THE American and Chinese Governments have resolved a potentially
massive trade war over rights to intellectual property. ''Intellectual
property'' may sound remote and abstract but it is quite concrete,
covering items as different as copyright and patent royalties. A
post-industrial culture, which characterises much of Western society
including the United States, depends a lot for its economic health on
the profits such items generate. Essentially what is being sold is not
manufactured artefacts but the ideas, the intellectual blueprints, which
led to their original creation. It is relatively easy to control and
monitor the export of manufactured objects so that they can be paid for.
Know-how is, however, an intangible and can only be protected -- and
paid for -- by mutual agreement.
Developing economies are often reluctant to pay for such things which
can be made to seem no more than the common pool of accumulated
knowledge. Acquiring the knowledge is, however, more often than not the
outcome of large research and development costs which require recurrent
funding from profits. The latter are restricted if piracy creams them
off. The Americans, who still run the most innovative economy in the
world, have been enraged by the way in which China seemed to be willing
to play the pirate card. In fast developing south-eastern China, for
example, no less than 29 separate factories turn out American-designed
computers with no payments to the original creators. That will now stop.
That the Chinese will now pay something will not impede their
development. Probably the reverse will be true, for the flow of know-how
will increase and Sino-US trade will continue to grow by leaps and
bounds. The trade war, which definitely threatened, would by contrast
have been a zero sum game in which all would have lost.

Anne Simpson in Brussels talks to Pauline Green, the first lady of
European Socialism, respected across the community.
JUST occasionally in politics someone transcends the battlements of
party lines to be regarded with approval from all sides. When such
attention occurs internationally, you know the figure in question
commands real merit, and so it happens that Pauline Green is described
as ''a safe pair of hands'' in at least 11 languages.
In British terms she belongs to that threatened species, the
constructive European, but, as leader of the largest political group in
the European Parliament, Green commands 221 Socialists drawn from 19
different parties, some nations fielding more than one.
This variegated bunch also represents 15 separate cultures, and for
Green the artful business of nudging everyone into a cohesive whole is
like a game of multi-dimensional chess.
But there is another element to her diplomacy. A former London
policewoman, she still possesses that no-nonsense amiability which
distinguished the old fashioned bobby on the beat. Green is methodical,
disciplined, and fair, a stickler for detail but a good listener, a firm
adherent of commonsense.
The fact that her own constituency -- which takes in Barnet, Enfield,
and Harringey -- recently gained #57m of European funding for job
creation doesn't just reflect her parliamentary clout but, she says, it
provides a sad indictment of the place that London has become.
Everything she witnessed on the streets in her early police days
convinced her of the link between poverty and crime, and it was the
crushing ugliness of that evidence which drew her into socialism. Her
husband, whom she married in 1971, is still ''a London copper'', a Chief
Superintendent.
''Around 60% of the European money in Britain funds the various
training schemes for the unemployed,'' she says. ''Yet who knows this?
People think it's British Government money because hardly anyone spells
out the positive aspects of belonging to the European Union.
''I don't think Europe is The Big Answer to everything -- there's a
lot wrong which many of us are fighting to put right -- but it does
offer effective regional co-operation, and maybe, if we can get things
corrected, we will have a model international government that will offer
something better and different for the next century.''
As Pauline Green sits in her Brussels office, the view from the window
takes in the radiant rise and rise of the new EU Parliament buildings,
cranes swinging their lumber up and down, back and forth, casting
splinters of shadow across her desk.
For Green the clattering activity is symbolic: the edifice being
shaped before her eyes is itself not without controversy and problems,
and noisy elements of power struggle. But it will accommodate the
future, she believes, and she cares passionately that Britain may be
locking itself out.
Clearly the chauvinism and negative focus of the British debate are an
embarrassment, but they also underline just how little the English
particularly have grasped the realities of Britain's declining
international might.
''At home, because of the Government's disastrous handling, I see a
lot of confusion which is driving people towards the Euro-sceptic
position and I feel extremely sad.
''In political terms this is hugely damaging because Britain is being
utterly isolated. John Major's Government is regarded as an aberration
in Brussels, and the member states are scratching their heads in
disbelief at the way Europe is presented to the British.''
But part of the fault, she concedes, belongs to committed Europeans
themselves. ''We were all so preoccupied with making Europe work
technically -- as a means of setting standards for this and that -- that
we overlooked the fact that we must create among the British an
emotional attachment to the concept of a united Europe.''
This neglect, she believes, has allowed a vacuum to develop which
anti-Europeans are now exploiting. ''But all this nonsense about curved
bananas and curly cucumbers, it's rubbish. Who among the tabloids
reported that it was the British Government who actually asked the
Commission to come forward with standards for bananas?''
What angers her most about the current disarray, however, is that the
agenda is being dominated by a handful of politicians. ''I don't know
why we're allowing this to happen, but the Euro-sceptics appear to have
a free rein. Some people say committed Europeans are not arguing
strongly against them. Well, that's simply not true but no one at home
takes a blind bit of notice.''
Green cites the single currency kerfuffle as an example. As a devout
Blair-ite, she echoes her own Labour leader's view that Britain must not
turn its back on negotiations, but be at the heart of discussion in
order to ensure the outcome is right for the country.
''Here we have the Euro-sceptics shouting that we should use the veto
to stop the whole thing happening, but there is no veto. In the
Maastricht Treaty, John Major signed up for having a single currency in
the EU by 1999. So where is this veto he should exercise to prevent it?
The answer is: there simply isn't one.''
Pauline Green knows practically every nuance of the Maastricht
document, and during the coming months she will be responsible for
shaping her group's stance on it in readiness for the negotiations to
re-draft the treaty.
Not all the debate will be harmonious. There has, for instance,
already been a run-in with the leader of the French Socialists,
Elisabeth Guigou who proposed the ending of national vetoes, and the
election of the EU President.
Green has made it plain she sees no benefit in either suggestion, but
she prides herself on her consensus-driven style of politics and speaks
repeatedly of ''developing the common threads that unite us all as
European people''.
It is deceptive, of course, to assume that Euro-scepticism sits only
on Tory benches. In her home team, Green has her own squad of doubters,
but she has never shrunk from clipping offenders into line.
A colleague remembers how on one occasion, when the party had split
over a point of procedure, she ''tore into them, telling them this was
no way to behave''. In its way this was a good bit of community
policing, and all witnesses were suitably chastened and impressed.
The daughter of a peripatetic army couple (her father served in the
Royal Artillery; her mother is Maltese), Green grew up with Europe in
her sights. But her political career began with the co-operative
movement in London, where she became a full-time lobbyist for
environmental and consumer causes.
By all accounts she was effective, but it wasn't until she won her
European seat in 1989 that her reliable qualities propelled her into the
top echelons of the party. By 1994's Euro-elections she was leading the
British Labour group, and being asked by the late John Smith to consider
the Euro job should it become available.
The fact that she now holds the post signifies a small footprint in
history: she is not just the first British leader of the European
Socialists, but also the first woman at the helm.
Britain's anti-European feelings, she suspects, are largely a
generational hang-up. ''I pin my hope on the young. I spend a lot of
time talking to them about the EU and I find them far less frightened
and suspicious than their parents about the opportunities Europe offers.
''In fact, many of the young now see Bonn and Barcelona as being as
much a part of their work environment as, say, Birmingham. A lot of them
are being far more constructive about languages, but we do need to
ensure that Europe as a subject is regularly included in the school
curriculum.''
What must also be stressed, she says, is that Westminster and the
European Parliament do not have to be in competition. ''We are not
trying to take away powers from Westminster or to replace or duplicate
it. Nor are we trying to bring down the national Government.
''We are different and we are seeking to add value. Of course there is
a lot wrong with the EU -- especially in matters of democracy, the
mismanagement of funds, and the Common Agricultural Policy. But, my God,
there has been a lot wrong at home -- the poll tax, and what about the
lack of local democracy now, and the Criminal Justice Act?''
In the context of world strife, Green insists that peace between
member states is the EU's surest recommendation, and she quotes
President Mitterrand's recent reflection that nationalism equals war.
''There isn't another multi-national parliament anywhere in the
universe, but while we have so much in common our role is also to
preserve our precious diversity. But people want to know that there is
some vision in the world. They do not want to believe we are just here
to look after ourselves, and the rest can go hang.''
As for her, she feels both British and European in equal measure and
with equal pride. But it pains Pauline Green that no other European
country has squandered so much potential influence. Like a nervous
breakdown victim, Britain is avoiding honest self-examination by bolting
the door on its own exclusion zone.

Larnaca, Sunday
A BRITISH soldier arrested after two students were killed in an
alleged hit-and-run car crash on Cyprus has been released, police said.
The lance corporal, named as Gareth Austin, 24, who is serving on the
island with the Royal Green Jackets, is likely to be charged at a later
date.
The soldier was arrested after allegedly fleeing the scene of the
crash early yesterday on the road between the coastal town of Larnaca
and the British army base at Dhekelia.
Pakistani students Khan Athar Hussain, 18, and his cousin Khan Amir,
21, were killed when the motorcycle they were on was hit by a car found
abandoned nearby.
Police claim Austin, who was arrested later, had been drinking and
refused to give a breath sample. Another soldier travelling as a
passenger in the car was slightly injured and questioned by police, but
released after giving a statement.
Islanders have complained about the behaviour of some British
servicemen stationed in Cyprus.
Three members of the Royal Green Jackets are facing trial on the
island accused of killing a Danish woman tour guide last September.

Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, names the price
of Tory Euro-rebel support.
ON Wednesday night the House of Commons will vote upon a motion which
criticises the Government's policy towards Europe. I expect that the
Government will beat off this attack. However, in the process, the Prime
Minister will give us a further insight into Conservative-thinking about
the possibilities of a single currency in Europe.
Why do both sides of the argument regard the single currency as
important? And is it possible that both sides are wrong, and that the
issue is less vital than the politicans believe it to be? It is
certainly true that people do not talk much on the doorstep of
Wolverhampton about the single currency, but people in Glasgow and
Wolverhampton alike are vitally interested in the way that the
Government manages the economy.
There are still persistent criticisms of the levels of interest rates
in the year before we left the Exchange Rate Mechanism in mid-September
1992. Jobs were lost unnecessarily in Glasgow. Homes are still being
lost in the South-east of England because of the debt rolled up in the
years 1990-1992. People may say that they are interested only in the
results of policy. We, the politicians, are right to say that we are
also interested in the policy itself, so that we may learn from past
mistakes and prevent their repetition.
Over Europe the single currency is the most immediate issue. There
remains many a lingering doubt about the basis upon which the nation
gave its consent to the 1972 treaty by which we joined the European
Community.
Many, including Lady Thatcher, now regret their support for the single
European Act of 1986. The memories of the crude, and authoritarian way,
in which the Government smashed the Maastricht Treaty through the House
of Commons are fresh in the minds of both the public, and those, like
me, against whom that unconstitutional behaviour was directed.
If any mistake was made, this cannot be fully discussed in Europe --
still less rectified -- until the inter-governmental conference due to
start in 1996. The issue of the single currency is unresolved in the
Tory Party. The Maastricht Treaty of February 7, 1992, allowed Britain
an opt out. We participate in the preparations for a single currency.
However, we have the right, under the treaty, to opt out of the final
stage of movement to a single currency.
Until last Christmas, the Prime Minister avoided discussion of the
principles concerning the single currency. It was impossible to judge
what the decision would be, etc, etc. No sensible person would decide
until nearer the time, etc, etc. We can only judge when we know all the
facts, etc, etc. It may never come about anyway, why make enemies in
Europe unnecessarily, etc?
The past three months have seen the Tory Party overwhelmed by a tide
of Euro-scepticism which shows no sign of receding. Canute-like, the
Prime Minister at first resisted the tide. At Christmas, he decided that
he had to allow us some more information about his views.
On January 8, the Prime Minster gave an interview to Sir David Frost.
He said, in conversational style:
* We won't get a single currency in 1996 to 1997. ''Before that could
happen we would have needed almost certainly to have been in the
Exchange Rate Mechanism for two years, we aren't in it, there is no
immediate prospect of us going back into it.''
* ''The Bank of England would need to be independent. We have no
proposals to bring forward legislation for the independence of the Bank
of England.''
* ''There would need to be proper conversions of economies coming
together in performance right across Europe.''
On Wednesday he will have the opportunity to explain each of these
points. If the Exchange Rate Mechanism was basically a good idea and was
only wrong in detail, though perhaps harmed by lack of help from the
German Bundesbank, why do we not go back in, with more appropriate
details and conditions? Or does he now concede that the whole thing was
mistaken?
The Bank of England -- well, the Government could propose to make it
completely independent and could propose that it should merge in an
independent European central bank. Or is the Government now conceding
that any independent central bank, whether national or European, is
undemocratic, unparliamentary and unaccountable, and that we shall never
again allow our interest rates to be decided by the Germans.
Third, the whole country will want a proper explanation on
conversions. Economies may come together for a moment as trains come
together when they pass going in opposite directions. The question is
how they can remain converged. If they are held in an artificial
convergence, what happens? Scotland can tell England about this.
When the Act of Union brought England and Scotland together, Scotland
lost the right to change the value of its own currency. In return,
Scotland acquired the legal right for Scottish people to go to England
and to her colonies. She also gained the moral right to a higher level
of public expenditure than occurs in England.
The Prime Minister will tell us whether Frenchmen born in Algeria
would be welcome in large numbers in London. Would 10,000 Algerians be
as welcome in Battersea as Scottish vets are welcome in Yorkshire? Or
again, does the taxpayer in Glasgow want to subsidise the fishing fleet
in southern Greece?
The Prime Minister's arguments of January 8 appear to be permanent
barriers to our entry into the single currency. If he admits that these
are arguments of principle, then he may heal the rift in the Tory Party.
We shall all respond to the voice of firm leadership. His Cabinet,
maybe with some private reluctance, will recognise the voice of elected
authority. We can once more unite as a party determined to uphold not
the European federal dream, but the British national interest.

Andrew Wilson reports how the Barings bank has been mauled in the
volatile derivatives market, where fortunes can be made and lost
overnight in a welter of complex trading.
THE ironic epitaph for the independence of Barings, Britain's oldest
merchant bank, is: ''We chose the right things to do and avoided the
wrong things.'' Now with losses of more than #400m as a result of
unauthorised trading in derivatives by its Singapore office, which has
wiped out its capital and reserves, the bank -- founded in 1762 -- faces
an uncertain future.
The impact could be extremely serious world-wide, although it is too
early to envisage the long-term repercussions both to the City and the
global financial community. Rumours will spread of others in trouble,
and much will depend on the ability of the major banks to calm the
markets through guarantees.
The Barings statement was that made by chairman Mr Peter Baring in
October, after the bank had reported a 54% rise in half-time profits to
#54.8m and was meant to highlight the contrast between rivals such as S
G Warburg and Hambros, both of which had earlier issued profit warnings.
Barings' success had been partly built on its expertise in the Asian
markets, where about a third of its 4000 employees are based, but which
normally accounted for a much larger proportion of its profits -- some
#46m out of #100m in 1993.
In 1986, Barings startled the City when it emerged that Mr Christopher
Heath, who had built up its Japanese equity investment activities, had
earned the then unheard of sum of #2.5m -- although that is now dwarfed
by the #8m paid to a foreign-exchange dealer at Tokai Bank in London.
Growth in the derivatives market has been simply phenomenal and the
glamour is in some way reflected in the multi-coloured uniforms of the
frenetic Liffe futures exchange dealers in London.
These are increasingly complex financial vehicles to enable
participants to guard against the unexpected, such as interest and
currency-rate changes or sharp movements in commodities. In 1993,
interest rate-hedging turnover alone amounted to the equivalent of an
astronomical #600 billion as both, presumably cautious, company
treasurers and speculators covered their positions against loss.
The market has developed a language of its own, such as ''plain
vanilla'', put and call options which allow one either to sell or buy a
government security, share, currency, or commodity at an agreed price at
some future date, to the highly complex ''naked dogs'', which are based
on the interaction of US Treasury bonds and the Brady bonds issued in
place of existing debt of some developing countries, chiefly Mexico.
There is even one which allows US power-generating companies to trade
their permitted pollution allowances.
This crisis was one waiting to happen, and comes as little surprise
other than for the identity of the victim.
For a considerable period, regulatory and banking authorities have
become increasingly concerned over the growth of the derivatives market,
with the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee joining in, saying
on February 17 that it would look into the market as part of its broader
inquiry into the regulation of the financial services industry.
Earlier casualties have included pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo, now
bidding for Wellcome, which lost #115m as a result of failing fully to
understand derivatives, as it admitted, and by the German industrial
group Metallgesellschaft, which dropped about #1000m. That was as a
result of a US subsidiary agreeing long-term supply contracts and had
hedged itself against the price increasing. But with the oil price
falling sharply, the value of its security in the form of contracts fell
and it was called upon to pay margin calls. It had to be bailed out in a
#1500m rescue mounted by the German banks and shareholders.
There have been rumours of troubles pending in the derivatives market
which is inevitable given the volatility of both currencies and interest
rates, which are inextricably related, and also commodities. It seems
inevitable there will be casualties following the recent shakeout in
base metal prices on the London Metal Exchange as investment funds,
which had poured money into the sector late last year, may not have
covered their positions fully. The danger is that when one party is
unable to meet its obligations, the counterparty with whom it has a
contract will not be paid, which then rebounds throughout the system
unless the creditor has adequate financial reserves to withstand the
loss.
The Barings failure reduces the number of substantial independent
British merchant banks to just six. The most conspicuous is S G Warburg,
but that has effectively put itself up for sale following the
controversial merger talks with American securities house Morgan
Stanley. These were soon abandoned but left Warburg staff morale
reeling, with departures and the recent resignation of chief executive
Lord Cairns.
The others include Schroders, which is family-controlled although
listed on the stock market with a market capitalisation of #1940m and
about #350m more than that of Warburg and was involved in takeover and
merger deals last year worth #3815m compared with Warburg's #4080m.
Barings itself had leapt from eighth to fourth place at #2858m. There
have been perennial bid rumours swirling around Kleinwort Benson,
although Hambros is effectively bid-proof because of the family
holdings. The other two are privately owned N M Rothschild and Robert
Fleming. There are a handful of banks which are subsidiaries of other
organisations such as the HSBC-owned Samuel Montagu, Deutsche Bank's
Morgan Grenfell -- Deutsche and Barings share the same building in
Bishopsgate -- while the Pearson media empire controls Lazards.
The once-proud Hill Samuel is now part of the TSB group which paid
#777m for the privilege of diversifying and then wished it had kept its
cheque-book well locked away -- it nearly merged with Jim Slater's
Slater Walker Securities just over 20 years ago before that collapsed
and led to a Bank of England rescue.
The only consolation for the City is scant in that the Barings fiasco
took place overseas under a different regulatory regime.

THE world's richest nations yesterday formally pledged to work
together in building the twenty-first century information society.
Ministers from the G7 states committed themselves in Brussels to
''playing a leading role in the development of the global information
society''. This means that the revolution in worldwide computerised
communications, the so-called information superhighway, must be set up
by international negotiation.
Politicians, businessmen, and European Commissioners concluded three
days of talks on the subject which is set to dominate the industrial
scene in Europe for the coming decade.
With billions of pounds worth of business at stake through global
communications which will be available to everyone, the G7 states took
their first step towards agreeing standards and rules of access to the
electronic superhighway.
Leaders from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan, and the
United States, issued a communique which stated: ''Progress in
information technologies and communication is changing the way we live:
how we work and do business, how we educate our children, study and do
research, train ourselves, and how we are entertained . . .
''A new revolution is carrying mankind forward into the information
age. The smooth and effective transition towards the information society
is one of the most important tasks that should be undertaken in the last
decade of the 20th century. The outcome of this conference shows that G7
partners are committed to playing a leading role in the development of
the global information society.''
The communique added that countries in transition and developing
countries must be provided with the chance to take part in this process.
It called for international co-operation through trade organisations
and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The G7 states called for private investment to play a leading role,
for open access to computer networks, competition, and an adaptable
regulatory framework to replace the existing monopolies in
communications, which are now being tackled by the EU.
The talks in Brussels were overshadowed by the spy scandal in Paris
last week when the French Government ordered the Americans to remove
several diplomats accused of industrial espionage.
Politicians, including American Vice-President Mr Al Gore, also had to
dodge questions from Belgian journalists about the future of Mr Willy
Claes, Belgium's respected former Foreign Minister, who admitted last
week that he knew od illegal payments from an Italian helicopter firm as
''sweeteners'' for some of his socialist colleagues.
Mr Claes, who denied wrongdoing, is now secretary-general of Nato and
his job is seen as being under threat.
The G7 nations approved 11 pilot projects for international
co-operation in the information technologies, including plans for
developing long-distance health care, creating a global network of
electronic libraries, and a maritime information system to improve
safety at sea.
Experts have calculated that the information superhighway could
blossom quickly once the political will is harnessed. Last year alone,
according to US figures, it was worth $1.13 trillion. (#7151bn). EU
figures show the US holds 35% of the world information and communication
market, the EU 27%, and Japan 16%.
* The lure of the information superhighway is still a mystery to most
Europeans, according to one sign of the times yesterday. While a few
hundred computer buffs attended an exhibition at the G7, several
thousand Belgians turned out for the country's annual sex fair which
featured ''interactive'' sex by computer.

Elizabeth Buie reports how the big money that has come into boxing in
recent years is keeping the sport in existence when many feel that it
should be banned.
BOXING differs from all other sports in that its purpose is the
infliction of damage to the opponent's head or face. If it had never
existed in the past, and someone was to try to introduce it as a
professional sport it is unlikely that boxing would be permitted under
current sporting regulations.
That said, injuries like the one suffered by the American Gerald
McClellan on Saturday night in his fight with British boxer Nigel Benn
for the WBC super-middleweight crown are likely to continue to happen.
Despite calls for professional boxing to be banned, too much money is at
stake in this sport for the authorities to abolish it. And despite
better medical controls, the risks cannot be eliminated.
Professor Greg McLatchie, professor of sports medicine and surgical
sciences at the University of Sunderland, comes from a boxing family.
His father was a professional boxer, his brother a ''good standard''
amateur, and he did some boxing himself -- so he understands the ethos
of the sport.
''I come from a long family of boxing. I was a working-class kid where
there was not much else to do except box to get out of that situation,''
he said.
Nevertheless, he counts himself lucky. ''I got out early enough -- I
had an option,'' he said.
Recently, he was co-opted on to a committee set up by Professor John
Davies, professor of sports medicine at Cardiff University, as part of
an independent inquiry by the British Medical Association into safety
and boxing.
''We will be looking at the philosophy of the sport, safety and
medical cover, and looking to see if there is any way of preventing the
incidence of injuries in boxing,'' he said.
Accepting that he was not involved in examining Gerald McClellan,
Professor McLatchie makes the point that his blood clot could have been
caused by the first punch he received to the head or from the last when
he went down.
''He may have been bleeding very slowly throughout the fight -- I
would need to know what type of haemorrhage he had,'' he said.
''That is the problem for the doctor at the ring. He does not know
when that happens and nor does the referee.''
One possibility suggested by Professor McLatchie is devising some form
of telemetry between the referee and the doctor at the ringside. But,
for that, the doctor would need to be very experienced. It would also be
involving him to an unprecedented extent in controlling the sport -- a
move which would raise serious ethical questions. Many would argue that
a doctor should not be at a ringside watching a patient suffer torture
and damage, and that his duty would be to intervene at the first punch.
Various suggestions have been made to reduce the risks of serious
injury:
* Reduce the number of rounds -- already cut from 15 to 12 rounds
following evidence that the greatest risk of damage occurred in the last
three rounds of a fight
* An increase in the interval between rounds
* Bigger gloves -- already increased from 6oz to 8oz for light men,
and 8oz to 10oz for heavy men
* The wearing of headgear, as done by amateurs -- opposed by boxing
officials because the gap between the head and the helmet causes
vibration and the helmets also cause blinkered vision. Doctors suggest
that protective headgear may reduce the risk of injury from an acute
blow, but say it does not alter the effect of accumulative brain damage.
Professional boxers do now receive regular brain scans, but the
problem with such procedures is that they tend to show damage only after
it has occurred.
Both Professor McLatchie and the Labour MP and neuro-surgeon Sam
Galbraith have been involved in treating men suffering from what is
commonly known as the punch-drunk syndrome.
''I have seen guys in their 50s who had the brains of 70 or
80-year-olds in terms of loss of brain cells from accumulative battering
of the head,'' said Professor McLatchie.
Mr Galbraith first became involved in studying brain injuries to
boxers while working as a neuro-surgeon at Glasgow's Southern General
hospital.
He is convinced that professional boxing should be banned. While a ban
in Britain might send British boxers abroad, this argument should not
deter the British Government, said Mr Galbraith.
''It has been banned in some Scandinavian countries, but each country
has to look to its own laws -- that is the nature of the independence of
sovereignty,'' he said.
Would a ban drive the sport underground? Mr Galbraith is not sure.
''There would be a few back-street prize-fighters, but I think that
policing is such that that could probably be largely avoided. You would
never eliminate it absolutely -- we have never eliminated
cock-fighting,'' he said.
The biggest barrier to a ban is, he believes, the money and publicity
attached to the sport.
''Before the television deals it was dying on its feet. It only
recovered because of the huge money pumped in by television,'' he said.
Gerry Woolard, an administrative steward of the British Boxing Board
of Control, does not deny the importance of money in the sport.
''Where else would you get #750,000 for 40 minutes' work?'' he asks,
referring to the McClellan-Benn match purse.
Nevertheless, he maintains that ''we do every mortal thing we can to
make it as safe a sport as possible''.
Statistics would put boxing at around the 1000th most dangerous sport,
he says. But it is high-profile and it is a dangerous sport. It will
never be anything else, he says, and boxers are made well aware of the
risks before they are allowed to turn professional.
''Many people go in and come out wealthier, healthier, and better
people for it. For every one McClelland you have, there are are dozens
of bouts where nothing happens,'' said Mr Woolard.
After 38 years of involvement in the sport, he believes that the
medical controls now in place make the risks of boxers suffering from
punch-drunk syndrome much lower than in the 1950s and 1960s.
He knows that once again, the safety record of the sport will be
scrutinised.
''We have always got to defend ourselves when something like this
happens -- but there are inherent risks and every fighter who gets a
licence is warned of them. It is a voluntary thing for him. Fellows go
in because they enjoy the sport as well as for the cash. Incidents like
McClellan's will happen again. I just pray to God it does not happen too
often. There has been a bad spate in the past five years, but the five
years before that were relatively clear. I believe it is just chance,''
he said.
Professor McLatchie believes that we will have to professionalise
sports medicine if we want to ensure that boxers are safeguarded all the
time.
He is also anxious to put the fighters into context. The vast majority
come from deprived backgrounds and boxing stops them smoking and
drinking and makes them watch their diets.
''I am not sure if boxing is a totally bad thing. We have to balance
dying in the ring or dying from smoking and drinking. I cannot make that
value judgment, but in general terms, the risk of getting a brain
haemorrhage is a fairly small risk and it may well be worth balancing
that against the other risks,'' he said.
The only way to ensure that boxers do not suffer brain damage is to
''take the head out of boxing as a target,'' believes Professor
McLatchie.
''But where would boxing be then?''

Grozny, Sunday
HUNDREDS of elderly civilians are trapped under a fierce Russian
bombardment in a southern area of the shattered Chechen capital Grozny
without food or medicine, said witnesses who managed to slip out of the
city today.
''Conditions in the district of Chernorechiye are the worst of the
war,'' claimed Hassan, a Chechen who walked from the devastated city
through a forest to try to arrange the evacuation of civilians.
''We have 18 wounded civilians, some of them very seriously injured.
There is no food or medicine to speak of. I personally have buried 12
elderly who died of starvation in recent days,'' he said.
A Russian woman reporter who hiked out of Grozny with Hassan after
being trapped in Chernorechiye for a week confirmed the gravity of the
situation.
''Chernorechiye needs humanitarian aid and somebody needs to go in
with a bus and bring the wounded out,'' she said.
''Russian artillery fire never lets up. People are living in cellars
without food or running water or light. It's terrible.''
She said most of those still in the area were old ethnic Russians.
Russian troops occupied the centre of Grozny earlier this month after
nearly two months of bitter street fighting, but Chechen fighters clung
on to some southern suburbs, including Chernorechiye.
The Russians have pounded the area with artillery fire all week,
apparently in the belief that it is still swarming with Chechen troops,
witnesses said.
Meanwhile the people of Shali, about 12 miles from Grozny, were still
in shock today after a Russian bombing raid which killed seven civilians
and wounded 15 others.
Two children and their parents were among those killed when Russian
warplanes bombed the town yesterday afternoon, witnesses said.
''At first we couldn't find the head of the boy, but then we found one
part on a fence and another part down the street,'' said neighbour
Ramazan Yahihanov.
A blast which killed at least 25 Russian serviceman in Chechnya
yesterday was caused by an accidental electrical short-circuit which
caused an anti-mine device to explode, Tass said today.
Sources at Russian military headquarters in Mozdok said the accident
happened while a sapper unit on the southern outskirts of Grozny was
preparing a device to be used to explode mines by remote control.
Russian officials say more than 1100 servicemen have died so far in
the war which started on December 11 when the Kremlin sent in troops and
armour to crush Chechnya's three-year-old bid for independence.--Reuter.

PREPARATIONS for oil production at the Foinaven Field to the West of
Shetland escaped serious disruption by the earthquake at Kobe in Japan
by just a few days.
The subsea flowline facilities for Phase One of the #550m project were
manufactured near the centre of the disaster but it transpired that the
equipment had been transported to southern Japan just days before the
tragedy.
Details of the Foinaven project will be revealed at exhibitions in
Orkney and Shetland this week. The Foinaven Field lies in the Atlantic
Trough where exploration for oil and gas began in 1972 and around 100
wells were drilled before the first commercial discovery, Foinaven, in
1992.
The field is in water between 400 and 600 metres deep, 117 miles west
of the Shetland Isles. The wind and wave conditions are similar to those
the oil industry has grown accustomed to in the North Sea, but the
currents are significantly more complex and the water depth, which is
too deep for divers, presents a formidable technical challenge.
Recoverable oil reserves are estimated at around 250-500 million
barrels and in the planning to extract that oil BP undertook in 1993 the
biggest seismic survey it has done anywhere in the world, covering an
area the size of Fife.
Horizontal drilling, which has made considerable advances over the
past five years and which results in increased flow rates, meant that
instead of 28 wells being required only 14 were necessary.
For the first time in a BP-operated offshore environment some of the
producing wells will be multi-lateral -- two or more wells will share
the same well bore with oil flowing through each. This is expected to
reduce costs by 25%.
Foinaven is being developed on a ''fast track schedule plan'' and a
key element of this is that, instead of the traditional practice of
appraisal, pre-project work, and construction following each other, the
time taken for each has been shortened and all are done in parallel.
Oil will be produced from Foinaven through the five-year-old vessel
Petrojarl IV which is undergoing major rebuilding in Spain.
On completion, the 240 metre vessel will be part ship, part crude oil
and gas processing plant, and part storage unit. It will be held on
station by ten anchors and will be able to operate in severe weather
conditions.
Shuttle tankers will visit every three days during peak production.
The proposal for the design and operation of the facilities is being
undertaken by a consortium led by McDermott Marine Construction Ltd and
Golar-Nor Offshore. Their target is to achieve production two years from
now.

UNISON, Britain's largest trade union, will this week submit pay
claims on behalf of 30,000 electricity workers based on the pay
''bonanzas'' received by power industry bosses over the past year.
Demands to be lodged with the 19 national and regional electricity
companies will reflect increases of up to 38% and averaging 11.3%
enjoyed by the chairmen and chief executives, according to Mr Sol Mead,
Unison deputy head of electricity.
He said: ''We are determined to stop the sickening cycle of inequality
and injustice in the privatised electricity industry.''
Unison negotiators would be putting equality of treatment between
directors' pay rises and company employees at the top of their pay
bargaining agenda this year, because the staff deserved fair
compensation for their unsung contribution to the companies' wealth.
According to Unison, the 38% increase went to the highest-paid
director at Yorkshire Electricity, taking his salary to #239,000 at a
time when the workforce was reduced by 18.8%. Eastern Electric's
highest-paid received 33.73% moving him up to #341,000 with a 14.4%
reduction in staff.
Executive pay rises are to be investigated further when PowerGen
directors, including chief executive Mr Ed Wallis, appear before the
Commons employment committee tomorrow.
According to Unison, he has benefited most from privatisation of the
power supply industry to a total of some #3.7m made up of additional
salary, share options and pensions.
Unison calculates that the chairmen and/or chief executives of the 17
power companies in England, Scotland and Wales have benefited by a
massive total of #29.3m since the industry was privatised in 1991.
By comparison, the latest Incomes Data Services pay survey published
today includes details of last year's pay settlement for Eastern
Electricity employees with manual workers receiving 2.9% and staff
receiving an average of 4.1%.
IDS reports that the majority of the 150 wage settlements reached so
far this year were worth at least 3%, with a rising proportion worth 4%
or more, and it expects the rising trend to continue.

AN RAF officer commanding the plane which the Prince of Wales nearly
crashed on Islay is to be severely criticised by the inquiry into the
mishap, sources said yesterday.
The report will say the squadron leader should have immediately taken
control from the Prince when he ran into difficulties as the plane was
about to land.
Instead, with the Prince at the controls, the four-engined passenger
jet with 11 people on board touched down too late and too fast, sources
said.
It thundered down the tarmac, ending up nose-down and leaning on one
side in grass at the end of the 5000ft runway.
The RAF sources said the Prince had decided to make the landing
despite difficulties on his final approach.
But the inquiry found responsibility still rested with the squadron
leader, sitting to the left of the Prince in the cockpit of the #30m BAe
146 of the Royal Flight.
''The guy on the left should have shouted out to His Royal Highness
and said: 'I have control','' said the sources.
''But how do you shout that to the heir to the throne, effectively
saying 'I'm sorry mate, but you've got it wrong?'
''But by the strict letter of the law, he was the man in charge and
the buck stops with him.''
Neither the Ministry of Defence nor Buckingham Palace would comment.
After the landing in June last year, Charles made light of the
episode, telling local children: ''It wasn't quite a crash. We went off
the end of the runway, unfortunately.''
After the landing the jet remained on Islay for seven weeks for
detailed examination and for repairs before it could be flown back to
RAF Benson, Oxfordshire.
The cost of the damage has not been disclosed, but is thought to be
around #1m. It went back into service with the Royal Flight in January.

Corleone, Sicily, Sunday
SICILIAN gangsters shot dead a young couple in Corleone over the
weekend raising fears of a revival of Mafia clan warfare after a 16-year
truce in the town, immortalised by Hollywood in the Godfather films.
Francesco Saporito, 30 and his wife Giovanna Giammona, 27, died in a
hail of bullets when their car was ambushed by a gang of at least three
gunmen last night, police said.
The couple's two-year-old son Antonino survived because his mother
shielded him from the gunfire with her body.
Giovanna Giammona was the second person from the same family gunned
down in recent weeks in the hilltop town, 40 miles from Palermo.
Her 22-year-old brother Giusto was shot dead by gunmen last month
while working in his clothes shop. His killing prompted an anti-Mafia
demonstration by hundreds of locals.
The shootings are the first Mafia killings for 16 years in the town
which was the birthplace of a host of Cosa Nostra chiefs including
''boss of bosses'', Salvatore ''Toto'' Riina.
Signs of Mafia intimidation have been on the rise there in recent
months. Last March, Giuseppe Cipriani, the leftist mayor of Corleone and
anti-Mafia campaigner, found the head of a calf in front of his house --
a symbol of intimidation associated with the mob.
Riina, nicknamed the ''Beast'', was arrested in 1993 after almost a
quarter-of-a-century on the run. He is on trial for a catalogue of
crimes including ordering the murder of anti-Mafia Judge Giovanni
Falcone in 1992.
The town of Corleone featured in the 1972 Francis Ford Coppola film
The Godfather, starring Marlon Brando as a ruthless Mafia boss named Don
Corleone.--Reuter.

MOGADISHU: Rival Somali militias fought with anti-aircraft guns and
mortars outside the United Nations-held airfield in the capital
Mogadishu yesterday, interrupting operations to evacuate the rearguard
of foreign troops. Fierce battles with heavy gunfire and shelling
continued after dark, forcing an aircraft due to ferry out equipment to
turn back. A UN spokesman said: ''We were not targeted, not did we fire
back.''
Tomorrow 2500 US Marines and 500 Italians are expected to land near
Mogadishu to shield the retreat of Pakistani and Bangladeshi
peacekeepers, ending two years of UN intervention in Somalia.

THE GOVERNMENT will be asked today to respond to continued speculation
that Highlands and Islands Enterprise at present has underspent its
near-#80m budget by at least #9m and perhaps as much as #11m.
Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat MP for Inverness, Nairn and
Lochaber, will table three questions this morning for the Scottish
Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, about HIE's finances.
He told The Herald last night: ''I have heard that there has been a
considerable underspend by HIE, and I want Ian Lang to tell us what the
level of that underspend in the current year is. I also want to know
whether there has been consideration of using these funds to help the
threatened Jobs, Enterprise and Training (Jet) scheme which has been
financed by Highland region.
''There is a danger that the Jet scheme will come to a grinding halt.
Not only will this threaten 110 jobs, it will also affect the training
of over 1000 young and unemployed people in mid-course. This seems to me
a very good way of saving the programme and the jobs associated with
it.''
Highland Regional Council, which has to make cuts in order to avoid
being capped by the Government, will decide on Thursday whether to
withdraw its #1.4m worth of support for the Jet scheme. Discussions have
been continuing with HIE to see whether it can help.
In a statement issued last week on the Jet scheme, HIE responded to
the suggestions of underspend: ''As far as HIE's own expenditure is
concerned, HIE's budgets are fully committed in the current financial
year.''
The Herald understands, however, that there is an underspend at
present, but that this is not an unusual position for HIE to be in at
this time of year. The position, however, seems to be worse this year
because several substantial projects had been due to be funded in this
financial year but will not now be ready until after April 1.

CAIRO: The Egyptian army has found a British Second World War supply
lorry that has been lost in the Western Desert for more than 50 years, a
Cairo newspaper reported. The vehicle, which had belonged to the
British-led wartime Allies, was more than 1300 miles from the town of
Al-Alamein where the Allies fought a major tank battle with German
forces in 1942. It was still loaded with gas containers, milk produced
in 1941, bullets, oil, and other supplies.

UP TO 650 jobs in Highland Regional Council will be axed next year,
unless the Government acts over cuts in local government finance, the
council's vice-convener claims.
The warning by Mr Peter Peacock comes in a report to be considered on
Thursday at a special budgetary council meeting. The full impact of
Government cuts on public spending will have a serious long-term effect
on services and jobs, he says.
The region has to find savings of #12.9m to avoid capping in the
1995/96 financial year. A total of #10.5m of short-term measures have
been identified to mitigate the impact, but this cushion will not be
available next year, when finances will be even tighter. This could mean
that between 500 and 650 jobs across all services might have to be axed.
He says: ''The budget we are about to set for 1995/96 should be seen
as buying time in which to plan very significant further reductions in
spending, no doubt in conjunction with the shadow Highland Council. The
full magnitude of Government cuts was on a level far beyond anything
previously experienced by the council.
''It is clear that no area of the council's current activity will be
free from scrutiny and many things that people have believed were
sacrosanct will need to be open to potential change.''
Mr Peacock emphasises that these job losses will be over and above the
200 jobs that may go from the regional and district councils when the
single-tier Highland Council takes over in April 1996.
He says: ''The Government expects ''efficiency measures' to cover wage
inflation, but no informed commentator on the affairs of local
government believes this to be possible, given the scale of the wage
bills of local government as a percentage of their total activity.
''This totally unrealistic approach by Government can only be
interpreted as disguising their real intention to reduce public spending
levels and therefore the service levels that people currently enjoy.''
Mr Peacock and his council colleagues will still have to find #2.4m of
savings on Thursday to reach the #12.9m needed to avoid capping. At one
point, it appeared as though 250 jobs in education might have to go. Now
it is proposed to save the #1.4m allocated to the Jet (Job, Enterprise,
and Training) scheme which employs about 110 people.

* Mr George Kynoch, the recently-appointed Scottish Local Government
Minister, was yesterday challenged by his Labour counterpart, Mr John
McAllion, to ''set the record straight'' on local councils' staffing
levels.
Mr Allan Stewart, Mr Kynoch's predecessor, had claimed in a letter to
Mr McAllion that ''Scottish local authority manpower has continued to
grow during a period when, for example, Scottish Office staff numbers
have been reduced significantly''.
However, according to figures from the Joint Staffing Watch for
Scotland, there was a reduction of 200 in local government staff numbers
from 255,500 in 1990 to last year. A parliamentary answer to Mr
McAllion, said there was an increase in Scottish Office staff of more
than 480 from a figure of 12,575 in the same period.

THE PARENTS of eight children in care for almost five years amid
allegations of satanic-style, paedophile orgies in Ayrshire will today
find out if they can be reunited.
Three Law Lords at the Court of Session will hear Sheriff Colin
Miller's report into reopened proceedings involving three families.
Their children, then aged 10 months to 11 years, were removed by social
workers under place-of-safety orders in 1990.
Since then, at least three children have not even seen their parents
in a case which bears remarkable similarities to the Orkney child sex
scandal.
The families successfully won the right for a rehearing in 1993, held
behind closed doors at a specially-prepared courtroom at Ayr racecourse.
Supposed to last a few weeks, it lasted more than a year.
Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Hope, and two others will today
receive the report prepared by Sheriff Miller.
If they find in the parents' favour, the judges would have to decide
when -- and how -- the children could be reunited with their parents.
The five-year timetable began after a mother told a doctor of her
suspicions about her husband allegedly sexually abusing two of their
sons. She claimed later that she was mentally disturbed at the time.
But on June 22, 1990, a police surgeon and a paediatrician found hymen
damage to two girls named in the inquiry in which up to 70 adults and
children were allegedly involved. Their report suggested the girls had
been abused, with one in particular ''the victim of repeated and
long-term instances of sexual abuse''.
Solicitors ridiculed that evidence, alleging the damage, as recorded,
could be self inflicted or caused by scratching or by riding a bike. The
swoops continued, with children removed from nursery or school if
necessary.
In 1992, Sheriff Neil Gow supported the children's panel decision to
take the four girls and four boys into care. He was satisfied an evil
ring of vice was operating, based on claims which amounted to extreme
and sadistic sexual abuse made by two of the eight children during
disclosure sessions with social workers.
Sheriff Gow said some allegations were almost too extraordinary to
believe, but there was medical corroboration of some of them. He
concluded there had been systematic sexual abuse and corruption of the
children by several male and female adults.
His judgment disclosed sex games at the root of allegations, which
even involved putting naked children in a long narrow box, telling them
to pretend to be dead.
Sheriff Gow concluded: ''I am bound to say that in the whole of my
professional life, covering 33 years in practice as an advocate and 15
years on the bench, I have never come across a case so distressing and
appalling as this.''

GLASGOW Airport looks set for a winter boost with the news that
American Airlines is considering a resumption of its year-round daily
service to Chicago.
The airline is to start a seasonal service at the beginning of April.
If it proves successful, they will continue after the planned November
deadline.
Mr Hans Mirka, senior vice-president of American Airlines, said: ''We
want this service to work and all the indicators are that it will. Now
we would like Scots to find out what we have to offer.''
Speaking exclusively to The Herald, he was unable to give a pledge on
the future of the service, but said: ''I am hopeful that the business is
there for us to stay in Scotland over the winter. We want to, but the
figures have to match up and we will be taking a close look at the route
in August or September.''
Mr Mirka disclosed that when the winter service was withdrawn last
year it was losing up to $1m a month between November and April and
that, despite the success of the summer programme, it was not enough to
justify keeping the winter flights going.
The Glasgow to Chicago service was withdrawn last year -- creating a
domino effect which saw Northwest end its flights to Boston and United
withdraw from the Washington route.
This left British Airways and Air Canada as the only airlines offering
scheduled flights to North America, with the former extending its five
times a week service to New York on to Boston and the latter offering
flights to Toronto all year and to a range of other destinations in the
summer.
Now American Airlines is making it clear that it wants to join its two
rivals in serving the growing North American market.
Already the airline has brought its summer launch date forward to the
beginning of April and will use a Boeing 767-200 aircraft with 14 first
class seats, 30 in business, and 128 in coach. Load factors are
beginning to reach 50% with a target of 75% for a succesful season.
Mr Mirka said: ''To be blunt we need 20% of the people on the plane
paying full fare. We don't want it to be thought that this will not be a
success if everyone is not up at the front of the plane. As long as
there is a good mix of passengers and fares then the yields will
follow.''
He is confident that the airline and travel industries -- a ready
barometer of world economy because they are the first to suffer if
business is bad -- are recovering from the recession.
He said: ''Slowly but surely things are getting better and we need to
be ready to take advantage of new markets.''
On the talks between Britain and the USA to decide reciprocal traffic
rights which resumed last week, Mr Mirka is diplomatic but barely hides
his frustration.
He said: ''We have a situation where British Airways has direct access
to 17 cities in the USA and through its partnership with USAir offers
another 60 US destinations, but we are not allowed to operate certain
routes from the major UK airports and cannot even offer a codeshare
flight with British Midland from Edinburgh.
''That is unfair, but I am confident that we can work with Transport
Minister (Brian) Mawhinney and his team to find solutions. I can
understand the affinity with BA as the national flag carrier, but they
are a private outfit just like us and we should be operating on a level
playing field.''
He is glad that American and British Airways will work together out of
Glasgow because they will ''grow the market together''. He uses the
analogy of a pie which too many people wanted a slice of last year which
can now comfortably be shared between two.
''Don't get me wrong. Out of Heathrow we are in fierce competition
with British Airways on routes like New York, but from Glasgow we are
serving different markets.''
Mr Mirka hopes that Scots will take advantage of the hub at Chicago's
O'Hare Airport which has 336 flights a day and has flights to most major
American centres timed to coincide with the afternoon arrival of the
Glasgow flight.
Meanwhile, Holland's largest tour operator De Jong Intra Vakanties, is
to switch its 22-week summer programme from Glasgow to Prestwick.
Vice-president Cobie an Dongen said: ''Prestwick is a much better
holiday airport for us. Our passengers won't have to deal with the long
line-ups and high prices typical at other airports, and Prestwick has a
reputation for great customer service.''

lead a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in October.
The Church of Scotland minister, a former Lanarkshire collier, was
given his biblical name at birth. He became a born-again Christian in
1955, following American evangelist Billy Graham's first visit to
Scotland.
Mr Donaldson, who is married to Mary, preaches to a congregation of
about 250 in the Loch Ness-side village of Fort Augustus and nearby
Glengarry.
He expects to be joined by as many as 50 people on the tour of Old and
New Testament sites. Yesterday, he promised a safe passage for his
followers through the Middle East.
The package offers full board at the luxurious Pilgrim's Palace,
overlooking the ruined walls of the ancient city of Jerusalem. Once
dangerous and forbidden territory, it is now accessible because of the
Middle East peace process.
Included in the #910 price are tours which follow the footsteps of
Jesus through Bethlehem, Nazareth, and to the Sea of Galilee and the
Mount of Olives.
For a further #285, pilgrims will be able to take part in a Jordan
Extension -- which includes a visit to Mount Nebo, where the original
Moses is said to have first cast eyes on the Promised Land after 40
years wandering in the wilderness.
They will also visit the Rose Red City of Petra, an ancient rock-cut
settlement of narrow ravines and numerous temples, tombs, shrines, and
altars.
Mr Donaldson, who promises to entertain his party with hymns on his
''mouthie'' during the trips, said yesterday: ''This pilgrimage is sure
to be an inspiring experience for everyone who comes with me.
''I'd like people to cast their eyes on the same sights as the old man
Moses -- the real one -- did all those centuries ago.''

<HEADLINE>Club thrown out of cup as missiles fly. Referee ends game after five team-members sent off</HEADLINE>

A JUNIOR football club was yesterday thrown out of the Scottish cup
after a tie had to be abandoned when five of their players were sent
off, and missiles were thrown on to the pitch by some fans.
One man was knocked unconscious after being struck by a bottle.
The club, Dalry Thistle from Ayrshire, were playing a home OVD
Scottish Junior Cup fifth round tie with West Lothian club Whitburn on
Saturday.
The game was abandoned 10 minutes from time on the dismissal by
referee Cameron Melville of the fifth player, a substitute who had been
on the pitch only a matter of seconds. It left Dalry 2-0 down and with
only six players: a team must have seven players.
The junior game's ruling authority, the Scottish Junior Football
Association, convened a special meeting yesterday morning which decided
to put Whitburn through to the next round.
The SJFA president, Mr Joe Black, also ordered an immediate
investigation into the match, and promised to institute disciplinary
procedures against Dalry Thistle should the club be found guilty of
breaking association rules.
The Scottish Football Association is also monitoring the situation.
Whitburn's physiotherapist, Mr Ian Heeps, was knocked unconscious
after being struck by a bottle thrown from a group of home supporters.
Mr Heeps was taken to Crosshouse Hospital suffering concussion and was
detained overnight. He was believed to have been unconscious for a
half-hour. He was released yesterday afternoon following treatment.
Police said a 32-year-old man had been arrested within the Dalry
ground, Merksworth Park, in connection with an alleged breach of the
peace. A report has been sent to the procurator-fiscal.
They were continuing to investigate the bottle-throwing incidents.
.
Sanctions available to the SJFA include lengthy suspensions and
personal fines for the players sent off, as well the option of fines on
the Ayrshire club. Mr Black said Saturday's events had put the
reputation of junior football back 10 years, and were very
disappointing.
The association was awaiting reports from the referee and two
observers at the game. It expected to take any action within two weeks.
It was the first time the sides had played each other, and the
atmosphere had been ''combustible'' from the start, with 1100 fans
packed into the tight confines of the Ayrshire club's ground, according
to Whitburn secretary Jim Donald last night.
Whitburn's first goal in just three minutes had been greeted with a
shower of beer cans, he claimed.
Dalry's Stewart Mauchlen was sent off after 20 minutes.
Four colleagues, John McKay, Tom Cleary, team captain Craig McCallum
and Gerry Malone were dismissed in the second half by Mr Melville, from
Gourock.
The club's president, Mr James Dippie, said last night he preferred
not to comment on the team's expulsion from the competition before a
special meeting of Dalry Thistle's committee, to be held tonight.
He also refused to comment on the referee, but one of his team,
Stewart Mauchlen, the first player to be dismissed, said yesterday:
''The referee killed the game. I was booked after just five minutes for
what he said was persistent fouling and then was sent off 20 minutes in
for pointing at him.
''Then in the second half things just went crazy. The game was hard,
yes, but there was no need for a lot of the bookings he handed out.''
However, the Whitburn secretary, Mr Jim Donald, defended Mr Melville's
performance. ''He was given no option by the Dalry players. My team are
no angels, but there's a difference between playing hard and what they
did. They stepped well over the mark.''
The Whitburn secretary added he had feared the disorder could have
escalated into a major crowd disturbance.
He said: ''We had 500 fans there and I was very pleased with their
behaviour and that of our players. They were faced with intense
provocation but didn't get involved in any trouble. It could have been
much worse.''
Meanwhile, a Fife publican said yesterday he would be billing a
Carnoustie junior football club for damage caused by fans on Saturday.
Two regulars of the Tayport Arms in Fife were injured when a fracas
broke out involving 30 fans wearing the team colours of Carnoustie
Panmure.
The team had been defeated 1-0 by Tayport FC in a Scottish cup-tie in
which two players were sent off.
The publican, Mr Jim Rodger, alleged pool cues and glasses were thrown
during the incident, which continued even after the group were ejected.
''We threw them out but they hurled bricks and stones through the
three main windows, causing #250 worth of damage. I will be sending the
bill for replacing windows to the team,'' Mr Rodger said.
Mr Doug Mitchell, treasurer of Carnoustie Panmure said the club were
shocked by the incident but added they could not control the activities
of a minority.
He said: ''These people claim to be our supporters but we can't
prevent hooligans from coming along. The bus they came in was not
organised by the club.''
He added: ''I don't want to make any comment on the bill for the
damage at the moment.''
Fife police confirmed the incident but said no arrests had been made.

FARES on inter-island ferries in Shetland could double if the islands
council's budget crisis is not resolved.
That was the stark message yesterday from Councillor Magnus Flaws,
chairman of Shetland Islands Council's Roads and Transport Committee.
Councillor Flaws said the ferries budget for the coming year was short
of almost #300,000, much of it due to extra training for crews to bring
them up to new safety standards. He has called a special meeting this
afternoon.
He did not want to ''keep whacking increases on to people who carry
goods''. That would only put up prices in every island shop.
If all of the shortfall had to be made up from fares, he reckoned that
some ferry tickets would cost ''pretty near double''.
Mr Flaws added that councillors might have to insist on more cuts in
the leisure and recreation budget, or even in education, when the full
council meets on Wednesday to finalise budgets for 1995/96.
Councillor Tavish Scott, vice-chairman of the transport committee,
said the proposed increases were ''outrageous''.
''The council doesn't seem to have realised the swingeing effects of
these increases,'' he said. The ending of monthly season tickets would
mean that the average commuter paid 161 per cent more for a week's
journeys.
Children and pensioners would be paying five times the present single
fare of 10p.

THE massive expansion of higher education must be matched by extra
funding, if disaster is to be avoided, a a university principal has
warned.
Professor Andrew Miller, the Principal of Stirling University, said
that the Government's grant cuts could be a ''test to destruction''
whose ripple effects would be felt for decades.
Speaking at his university's graduation ceremony, he said that the
universities' financial resources to teach each student had fallen by
28%.
However, Professor Miller also said that productivity had risen by
nearly a third and that there was no clear evidence that teaching
standards had markedly fallen.
But he believed that Government demands for higher productivity
threatened ''detectable decreases in the educational experience''.
He said: ''We must regard the continued decrease in funding as a
Government experiment to see how much more can be squeezed out of
universities.
''There is a real danger that the experiment will be a test to
destruction. This would be a national disaster with negative economic
repercussions for decades.''
The number of universities in Britain has doubled to 90 during the
past two years, as former colleges and polytechnics have become
universities. Now one in three 18-year-olds goes on to take some form of
higher education.
By toiling so successfully, under the conditions of grant cuts and
increased workloads, Mr Miller said that university staff should be held
up as ''major British success stories''.

A YOUNG widow's battle to discover the truth about her husband's death
during a diving operation will take her to court today.
Mrs Claire Locke, 25, has fought for almost 18 months to find out why
her husband Stewart drowned while recovering drugs off the coast of
Peterhead.
The 24-year-old diver died helping Customs officers recover more than
#20m-worth of cannabis from the beached vessel Ambrosia in October 1993.
The drugs -- the biggest find on the east coast of Scotland -- were
strewn over the seabed and St Fergus beach after the converted trawler
sank and broke up.
Today, Mrs Locke will hear the first public accounts of the
circumstances of her husband's death when a fatal accident inquiry opens
at Peterhead Sheriff Court.
''I want to know exactly what happened when my husband died,'' said
the part-time science student yesterday.
''I know it is going to be very difficult to listen to a lot of the
evidence, but I want to discover the truth.''
Mrs Locke, of Baird Road, Strichen, Grampian, has been given no
compensation since her husband died.
She supports herself and her two children -- James, four, and
three-year-old Heather -- on a widow's state pension.
She is considering raising a civil action at the end of the inquiry,
which is expected to last for over a week.
The diving boss who hired Stewart Locke was fined #1200 at Peterhead
Sheriff Court last September.
John Allan, a partner in J. Allan Diving Services, admitted failing to
provide proper supervision and equipment for the dive at Scotstown
beach, near Peterhead.
The Belgian master of the Ambrosia, Peter Ketels, was acquitted of
drug smuggling after a three-day trial at the High Court in Aberdeen in
January last year.

A MURDER inquiry began in Clydebank yesterday after a 28-year-old man
who was attacked outside a busy hotel on Friday night died of his
injuries in hospital.
Mr John McCrae, who was single, was attacked while leaving the Radnor
Park Hotel with friends by two men. He was initially taken to the
Western Infirmary with serious head and shoulder injuries, but was later
transferred to the Southern General for specialist treatment where he
died yesterday morning.
Police are now interviewing the estimated 70 to 130 people who were in
the hotel at the time to try to discover a motive for the attack. It is
believed they are following a definite line of inquiry.
Detective Chief Inspector James McEwan said they had received a good
response so far, but they were keen to speak to everyone who was in the
Radnor Park on Friday night. He promised that any information would be
treated in confidence.
A neighbour of Mr McCrae's from Alexander Street in Clydebank, Mr
Stewart Anderson, was also injured in the attack, and is recovering in
hospital from serious cuts to his leg and shoulder.
A second attack took place less than two hours later and about a mile
away at another Clydebank hotel, the Cameron House, when steward
Crawford McKechnie, 28, from Milngavie, was slashed across both hands.
So far there is no indication that the attacks were linked.

THE Labour Party has launched an urgent inquiry into allegations that
up to #2m of taxpayers' money is being used in a campaign to swing
support in a fight over a parliamentary seat.
The accusations relate to the distribution of housing renovation
grants in inner-city wards across Birmingham.
Party leaders are to look into claims that councillors looking to
build up their power base are clearing the way for thousands of Labour
members to jump queues for grants.
Labour general secretary Tom Sawyer said: ''These are very serious
allegations and I will be initiating an immediate inquiry.
''I have no intention of allowing misconduct of any individual members
of the party to harm the reputation of Birmingham Council or the
Birmingham Labour Party.''
The investigation is understood to have the full support of Labour
Party leader Tony Blair.
One report estimated that around 9000 people have been offered grants
of up to #20,000.
Initial inquiries are reported to show that up to half of those grants
have gone to Labour Party members.
The immediate focus of the allegations is said to be the Sparkbrook
seat currently represented by former deputy party leader Roy Hattersley,
who is stepping down at the next election.

<RECORDNO>979648787</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ENGLAND'S leading judge yesterday defended his colleagues' recent
actions in overturning the decisions of Government Ministers, declaring:
''Nobody is above the law.''
The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, was commenting after recent
rulings in which Ministers have been found to have acted unlawfully,
such as over the Pergau Dam affair and the reform of criminal injuries
compensation payments.
Lord Taylor, in a wide-ranging interview for BBC1's On the Record
programme, said judges were only applying the law in these cases.
''The basic rule is that everyone is subject to the law. Lord Denning
used to love using the phrase 'be you never so high, the law is above
you'. That applies to Ministers.
''So even though they (Ministers) may have to move at the end of that
particular Parliament, why should the public have to put up with abuses
of power, if there are any, or people acting outside their powers while
they are in office?
''Where it's within the power of the Minister to do what he's done, we
would not interfere,'' he added.
Lord Taylor also had a message for Euro-sceptics who complain about
the courts overturning British law in favour of European law.
He said judges had no choice, because Parliament had decided to accept
European Community law when it passed the European Community Act in
1972.
Lord Taylor also repeated his call for Britain to incorporate the
European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law.
He said Britain had signed the convention in 1950, and helped draft it
but, because it was not incorporated, the UK faced the ''embarrassment''
of having actions taken several years ago ruled unlawful by European
judges.

DIRECT talks between the Government and Sinn Fein cannot begin as long
as the IRA continues to hold stockpiles of weapons, Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said yesterday.
His refusal to allow Sinn Fein a seat at the negotiating table
coincided with calls from Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin for
Ministerial-level talks to begin.
The Sinn Fein president, Mr Gerry Adams, said last night he would
eventually meet Prime Minister John Major to discuss the peace process.
''It is not a matter of if. It is only a matter of when the British will
be meeting us at Cabinet level,'' he said.
Sir Patrick's declaration that there would have to be ''substantial
progress'' on the decommissioning of weapons before Sinn Fein could join
negotiations will dampen expectations that the framework document
published last week would pave the way for direct negotiations between
Britain and Sinn Fein.
''If somebody comes to the negotiating table with other constitutional
parties but is known to have Semtex, ground-to-air missiles, heavy
machine-guns, mortars and so on, the implication is absolutely
inescapable that they are prepared to resort to former violence if they
don't get what they want round the table,'' he said on BBC TV's
Breakfast with Frost.
Britain and Sinn Fein have failed to agree on the question of weapons.
The Government argues that the six-month ceasefire makes weapons
unnecessary and that the IRA must prove its good intentions by giving up
the means of violence.
Sinn Fein's deputy president, Mr Martin McGuinness, who has held talks
with British civil servants at Stormont, told the conference that the
party's analysis of the framework document could only be discussed at
the highest level of government.
''The time for hiding behind the civil servants has gone. John Major
and (Northern Ireland Secretary) Patrick Mayhew must meet with Sinn Fein
soon,'' he said.
But the need to garner support for the framework document's ideas on a
lasting peace seemed bound to raise pressure on the Government for full
Ministerial contact with Sinn Fein.
Civil servants are expected to have another session of exploratory
talks with Sinn Fein at Stormont this week and Mr McGuinness said that
meeting, to discuss the release of prisoners, would mark the end of the
opening phase.
Despite these planned further talks, Mr McGuinness claimed it was
Government strategy to delay Ministerial contact for as long as possible
by using the excuse of the decommissioning of weapons.
''We told them, just in case the reality had escaped them, that the
British Government and the British Army had not defeated the IRA -- that
the IRA had not surrendered -- that the British Government could not
even remotely expect Sinn Fein to deliver that surrender for them,'' he
said.
Mr McGuinness stressed that loyalist paramilitaries had also
maintained their arsenals and said the Government had been unable to
show them any case elsewhere in the world where a move to resolve a
conflict involved a one-sided surrender of arms.
Sinn Fein, he said, was committed to removing all the guns from Irish
politics.
Last night Mr Adams argued that the Government has recognised Sinn
Fein's electoral mandate, and that therefore direct talks are the next
logical step. ''How can you hope to move forward the peace process if
you do not accord to a section of voters the same rights as other
parties?
''John Major will have to explain to people how he could proceed on
the basis that a section of the people -- 12.5% -- will not be included
in talks. I hope he will never have to offer any explanation. I hope he
will do the right thing. It is my instinctive notion that he will do the
right thing and commence those talks.''
Earlier, Mr Adams told the 500 Sinn Fein delegates at Dublin's Mansion
House that it was time for Ulster Unionists to join them in a quest for
a peaceful future.
In what was seen as an appeal to rank-and-file Unionists, Mr Adams
said their political leaders were playing ''the Orange Card'' in their
response to the framework document.
''The politics are politics of 'not an inch''' he said. ''But those
days are over and I would appeal to Unionists to engage fully in the
search for a lasting peace.''
But a leading Ulster Unionist MP, Mr Ken Maginnis, rejected Sinn
Fein's peace overture.
''Both traditions in Northern Ireland have for the past 25 years,
despite the violence, put their faith in the ballot box and not in the
ballot box in one hand and the Armalite in the other,'' he said.
''You must realise the hurt Gerry Adams has brought to the entire
community in Northern Ireland. He wrote the script for 25 years of
violence -- he personally wrote the script -- and his lieutenant Martin
McGuinness commanded the IRA.''

FRIENDS of the Earth Scotland has lodged a formal complaint with the
Advertising Standards Authority over Scottish Nuclear's recent
advertising campaign.
The environmental pressure group's complaint centres on a claim made
by Scottish Nuclear that nuclear power does not contribute to global
warming.
Mr Graham Stein, the group's energy campaigner, said: ''These adverts
are a deliberate attempt to mislead the public. There is no commercial
benefit in this advertising: ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro Electric
are already forced to take all Scottish Nuclear's electricity -- at
inflated prices. Taxpayers' money is clearly being used for nuclear
propaganda.''
In its complaint to the ASA, Friends of the Earth Scotland claims that
uranium mining and processing, fuel enrichment and fabrication and power
station construction all cause emissions of carbon dioxide -- the main
climate change gas.
The group is also challenging -- under the ASA's recently-tightened
rules on environmental claims -- assertions by Scottish Nuclear that
nuclear power is ''very environmentally responsible''.
''It is absurd that an industry which creates waste that remains
deadly for 240,000 years and for which there is no method of disposal
should claim environmental credentials,'' said Mr Stein.
''The announcement last week by John Gummer, the Environment
Secretary, giving the go-ahead to on-site dry storage goes further in
proving that the nuclear industry is at a dead end as it faces the ever
growing mountain of nuclear waste.''
Friends of the Earth Scotland has challenged the chairman of Scottish
Nuclear, Mr James Hann, to agree that, if the group's complaint is
upheld by the ASA, he will personally fund an advertisement by Friends
of the Earth in the Scottish press.
A spokesman for Scottish Nuclear said yesterday that the company stood
by its environmental message.
He said: ''Friends of the Earth point out that the 'uranium mining and
processing, fuel enrichment and fabrication and power station
construction all cause emissions of carbon dioxide'. These statements
are true, although the amounts produced in these processes are
negligible when compared with those produced by the operation of a
fossil fuel-fired power station.''
But he added: ''None of these processes is currently being carried out
in Scotland.''
The spokesman said: '''Burning' fuel in a nuclear reactor to create
heat in order to make the steam which drives turbine generators does not
create carbon dioxide. This is a statement which Friends of the Earth,
Greenpeace or any other organisation has been free to challenge for some
time. None has done so.
''Nuclear power stations do, however, have diesel generators which are
used as back-up systems to circulate coolant gas in the event of
reactors being shut down and loss of electricity from the National Grid.
Clearly, diesel generators, if used, burn fossil fuels and produce
CO[2].''
He added: ''In terms of their implication that the nuclear process
itself pumps out CO[2] into the atmosphere, we stand by our statement.
It depends on how the ASA wants to interpret what we say in our advert.
If you want to go to the level of saying that we drive around in our
company cars and create CO[2] that way, that is another question.''
Scottish Nuclear's recent environmental advertisements had attracted
many inquiries, including some from as far away as Germany, he said.
''Research carried out by MORI has clearly demonstrated that the
Scottish public do want more information about the contribution which
Scottish Nuclear makes to reducing emissions linked to global warming
and acid rain, as well as other information on the industry,'' he added.
Scottish Nuclear's chairman, Mr James Hann, said: ''We are committed
to being open and honest with the public and media, and have
demonstrated this through out Come and See Campaign, which is also
advertised.''

THE future of Scotland's hospitals was thrashed out at a clear-the-air
meeting between Labour Party leaders and trust chief executives in
Stirling yesterday.
It is believed that Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson and two
other senior colleagues reassured trust chief executives that there will
be no major upheaval in the health service in Scotland if Labour wins
the next election.
The meeting was called by the chief executives following Labour's
policy statement two weeks ago, in which the party revealed it would
abolish hospitals' trust status, end GPs' fundholder status, and
generally ''democratise'' the health service.
That sparked fears that under a Labour government the NHS in Scotland
would be heading for another demoralising major shake-up -- its sixth
major re-organisation since 1982.
While confirming his party's commitment to end trusts, and abolish
fundholder status, Mr Robertson said, after yesterday's meeting: ''There
will be minimal disruption to the service.
''We used this morning's meeting to restate our view that NHS trusts
will be re-absorbed into the main body of the NHS -- and we will be
abolishing GP fundholders.''
Refusing to give exact details of what had taken place, Mr Robertson,
MP for Hamilton, said: ''I wouldn't say anything about the meeting
because it was private, informal, and one of many which we will be
holding at all levels.''
Also present was Scottish Labour Party chairman Jim Devine. He said:
''The chief executives wanted some clarification on points, and we gave
them that clarification. It was a frank exchange, but it is fair to say
it was friendly.''
Trust chief executives Mr Martin Hill from the Royal Alexandra
Hospital in Paisley, Mr Jeremy Taylor of Grampian Healthcare, Mr Robert
Calderwood from the Southern General, and Mr Gerry Marr, chief executive
of Yorkhill NHS Trust, both Glasgow, attended the meeting.
A spokesman said: ''Representatives of the Scottish NHS Trust
Federation met this morning with three senior members of the Scottish
Labour Party to hold informal talks on issues concerning Labour Party
policy for health, including the recent statement about democracy at all
levels within the reformed NHS.
''A frank exchange of views took place in a constructive atmosphere.''
Welcoming the move, Unison regional officer Dave Watson, who
represents NHS senior managers, said there was concern within the NHS
that another major upheaval would be damaging and demoralising, but
added that trust managers would welcome the de-politicisation of their
jobs.
''The majority of senior managers have not welcomed the political
role,'' he said.
The future of the NHS is currently being debated by the Labour Party,
which has issued two consultation documents on the issue.
Mr Robertson said that the internal market system -- which places
boards and trusts in a purchaser-provider relationship, and which many
believe has wreaked havoc within the NHS -- would be scrapped.
''The competition elements within the NHS which have set trust against
trust, and trust against board, are something that we think have worked
against the interests of the NHS,'' he added. ''We will be examining
ways in which that can be replaced with more co-operation.
''We are not going to have an internal market but, obviously, we will
be looking carefully at those elements of the Scottish health service
that have worked.''
Non-executive members of trusts -- appointed by the Secretary of State
-- will move out when Labour moves in, but Mr Robertson could not give
details on who would replace them.
It has not been decided whether individual hospitals will have their
own elected boards, or if elected representatives will only serve at
health board level. These issues are currently being debated by the
Labour Party, added Mr Robertson.
''We certainly want to have a de-centralised system of management,''
he said.

A BOY who suffered from a severe heart blockage has become the first
child in the UK to be treated by a pioneering medical technique, which
has saved his life.
Doctors at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, used radio
frequency waves to open a blocked artery in the boy's heart.
The technique was a make-or-break operation for Mark Feeney, eight,
because two attempts to clear the blockage using conventional surgery
had failed.
It was vital to open the artery as Mark, from Motherwell Road,
Bellshill, Lanarkshire, otherwise risked heart failure.
Now Mark can return to his favourite sport of ice-skating, after years
of exhaustion and tiredness.
His mother Karen, 30, said: ''The doctors sat us down and explained
that they didn't want to give us odds on a successful outcome. The
chances against it working were so high.
''But we knew that without the treatment Mark could have died, and so
we knew we had to go ahead.
''Mark tried to lead the life of a normal boy but his lifestyle was
restricted. Physical activities were difficult.
''Mark would try to keep up with other children but was exhausted
after even normal play.''
''Naturally, we felt very nervous because Mark was the first child to
undergo this treatment.
''We thought it best to go home and wait for news as I could not bear
the thought of hanging about the hospital.
''When the doctors told us the operation was a success the relief was
tremendous. A terrific weight has been taken off our shoulders.''
The procedure was carried out jointly by Dr Neil Wilson, a heart
physician, and Mr Morgan Jamieson,a heart surgeon.
The technique works by passing a burst of radio frequency energy
through the catheter, heating the tip to 90C.
Once the blockage is cleared, a balloon catheter widens the artery and
a stent -- a tiny supporting cage -- is inserted to keep it open. This
is done though open-heart surgery.
However the doctors revealed how difficult the surgery was. Dr Wilson
said: ''Bleeding was a problem and he needed a six-pint blood
transfusion but skilled work by the anaesthetist, Dr Pauline Cullen,
kept blood loss down to six pints.
''Dr Cullen controlled blood pressure in the arteries and blood
clotting. Bleeding problems make it a potentially dangerous technique
but we are delighted that it went well. The benefit of the procedure
outweighed the risks.''
Dr Neil Wilson said: ''As far as we know this is the first time a
child's arteries to the lungs were unblocked by this treatment.
''Two attempts to unblock the left lung in the past three years had
failed to unblock the artery. He had lived all of his life on one lung.
''The right side of his heart had to pump against total blockage and
this would have destroyed the heart. Severe heart failure could have
resulted.''
The procedure has been made possible by the work in the hospital's
heart laboratory, but doctors fear that similar advances may not be
possible without renewal of the existing catheter laboratory. A drive is
on to replace the lab.
Mark was recently named a Young Achiever in a British award ceremony
in London because of his many operations.

<HEADLINE>Hong Kong lawyer buys Scottish castle and title</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979648793</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH castle and barony title has been bought by a Hong Kong
solicitor.
Mr Ma Ching Nam has paid around #330,000 for 353-year-old Mounie
Castle near Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, and the right to call himself
Baron Ma of Mounie.
He will also be able to apply to the Lord Lyon, King of Arms for the
grant of armorial bearings. The arms can then be inherited by the
baron's heirs.
But Mr Ma, from Hong Kong's Happy Valley district, said he was not
interested in the title. ''Quite the contrary, actually.'' He was more
interested in the castle's history, he said.
''I have lived and travelled quite extensively in the UK and obviously
Scotland. There are some very nice parts which was the reason behind
buying the castle.''
The sale of Mounie, with 15 acres and the barony, created a flurry of
interest when it was put on the market in Hong Kong by Scottish
solicitors acting for the seller, Mr Jim Martin, the local vet.
It was believed that the title was likely to be of particular interest
to Hong Kong Chinese after Hong Kong businesswoman and politician Lydia
Dunn was created a baroness in 1990.
Some excitement was generated in Scottish newspapers when it was
learned that a woman had approached the sellers with an eye to buying
the castle and title for her 13-year-old son, who was dubbed Baron Ah So
Young.
But in spite of all the press interest and publicity there were very
few potential buyers according to Mr Ma. ''Some of the reporting put
people off.''
Both Hong Kong Chinese and expatriate Scots have been looking for
houses in Scotland as hedges against difficulties following the handing
over of the colony to China. Edinburgh's Georgian New Town has proved
particularly attractive.
The price of #330,000 for Mounie and title is not excessive in Hong
Kong terms, say property experts, where a flat in a sought after area
can change hands for #500,000.
Mr Ma, in his mid 40s, inspected Mounie last year with his wife. The
couple have a small child. The castle has five bedrooms, a main hall,
library, sitting rooms and two bathrooms. He is expected to spend
holidays at Mounie, and has shown interest in keeping a horse .
''They were particularly nice. I am delighted to have sold to Mr Ma
rather than to an American,'' said Mr Martin, who served in Hong Kong
and the Far East with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps.
While there he learnt some Cantonese. ''I did not feel confident
enough to use it to him at first but when Mr Ma told me he might want to
keep a horse I said to him: 'You don't want a horse, you are a horse.'
His name means horse in Cantonese. His wife was amazed I knew the
word.''

POLICE searching for a West Yorkshire teenager missing for 120 days
have had a breakthrough. They have discovered that a photograph found on
a roll of film in the girl's bedroom and issued to the media last week,
was taken at Tantallon Castle in East Lothian.
Now police are trying to identify two girls pictured on the film who
may be from the same area.
Lindsay Jo Rimer, 13, disappeared from her Hebden Bridge home more
than three months ago.
Lindsay's family do not recognise the two girls, but hope someone in
Scotland may, because Lindsay has visited Scotland twice.
At first Lindsay's mother Geraldine Rimer thought the photos might be
linked with her daughter's recent trip to Germany, but inquiries there
drew a blank.
Mrs Rimer said last night: ''We've been in touch with Natalie Seeger's
family about the two girls in the photos, but we think they may be
something to do with a school exchange.''
Halifax detectives had spent the weekend searching moorland around the
girl's home after a witness came forward and said she had seen Lindsay
in the company of a man two days after she went missing.
Police hope someone will come forward with information about the other
girls now the location has been identified.
Last night, the man leading the hunt, Detective Chief Inspector
Sunderland, said: ''Now we know the location of the photographs, it's a
great breakthrough and we will be asking our colleagues in Scotland to
help.''
When last seen, dark-haired Lindsay was wearing a light grey hooded
sweatshirt with the words ''Dosse Posse'' on the back. She also wore
black boots with a yellow motif and a black watch with fluorescent
markings.

NURSES and health workers meet tomorrow to discuss their next moves in
a battle with the Government to win more pay.
The rank and file members of the Royal College of Nursing, Unison, the
Royal College of Midwives, the Health Visitors Association and the
Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP), are angry at the Pay Review
Body's national 1% award and are attempting to have it improved.
Leaders of these groups are to hold meetings in London over the
dispute and the RCN has also repeated its call for talks with the Prime
Minister.
Mr John Major refused to see the nurses last Thursday and passed their
request to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary, who in turn
asked Mr Gerald Malone, the Health Minister, to see them.
An RCN spokesman said: ''We have written to Mr Malone telling him that
we want to see the Prime Minister but have not heard any more.''
Physiotherapists belonging to the Professions Allied to Medicine
(PAMs) are already organising a series of hospital meetings to campaign
against the offer.
A spokesman for the CSP said: ''Over the last 10 years, during which
the Pay Review Body has been seen as independent and fair,
physiotherapists have never considered taking industrial action over
pay.
''Such action will be considered on Tuesday at an emergency meeting of
the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy's industrial relations
committee.''
All the groups have also pledged to consider a ballot of their members
on industrial action, because they regard it as deeply unfair that
hospital doctors and consultants have by contrast been offered 2.5%
across the board with up to 5% to be negotiated locally by trusts.
The Government rejects the protests and claims there is enough money
available in the trusts to fund pay rises of between 1.5%-3%.
Meanwhile, a Labour MP has claimed that almost #50m has been paid out
to doctors to subsidise the cost of computer equipment -- with
fund-holders given favourable treatment.
Mr Alan Milburn (Darlington) said that GP fund-holders received up to
75% of hardware costs and 100% of software costs, while non-fundholders
could only claim half of the costs of buying equipment.
The figures are disclosed as the Commons Public Accounts Committee
meets today to question Mr Alan Langlands, the head of the NHS
Executive, on whether GP fund-holding has represented good value for the
taxpayer.
Mr Milburn, a member of the committee, who obtained the figures
through Commons written replies, said they showed fund-holders in
England had been paid #48.2m to meet the cost of information technology
to support fund-holding between 1991/2 and 1993/4. Costs rose from
#11.6m in 1991/2 to #18.5m in 1993/4.
Mr Milburn said: ''The Conservatives are using taxpayers' money to
create a two-tier health service. All family doctors should have equal
access to public funds to meet their computer and clinical needs.''
Mr Malone said: ''All GPs receive the same level of computer funding
when they carry out the same tasks. As GP fund-holders have extra
responsibilities, such as purchasing services for their patients, they
receive extra funding to carry that out.''

A CLIMBER was taken by helicopter to hospital yesterday after falling
30ft in a Scottish glen.
Mr John Atkinson, 47, of Strathaven, near Glasgow, was not thought to
be seriously injured in the fall at Red Craigs, in Glen Doll, Angus.
A Royal Air Force Sea King helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth was
scrambled and he was taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. He was then
taken by ambulance to Dundee Royal Infirmary.
Another climber was injured late yesterday in a fall on Ben Alligin in
Torridon.
His companion placed the 62-year-old man in a survival bag and went to
raise the alarm. The climber, who was near the summit of the mountain,
was believed to have fractured ribs.
An RAF rescue helicopter was scrambled from Lossiemouth and members of
the local mountain rescue team were also heading for the accident scene.
Meanwhile, rescuers have abandoned their attempts to find three
climbers caught in a massive avalanche last Wednesday and a lone
mountaineer who fell on Ben Nevis nine days ago.
Police privately say they believe the men are dead, and that they do
not believe the bodies will be found until the thaw in late spring or
early summer.
In Glencoe, at Buachaille Etive Mor, the volunteers of Glencoe
Mountain Rescue Team have hunted alongside teams from RAF Leuchars and
Lossiemouth for three West Yorkshire men buried under 30ft of avalanche
debris.
Dr Allan Lang, 50, his student son Richard, 18, and his friend Paul
Bower, also 18, had been descending the 3400ft high peak when the
avalanche struck.
Since then up to 70 rescuers have dug a network of trenches in the
snow and have probed the surface with metal rods in a vain effort to
find the men. Dr Lang's wife Christine is staying near Glencoe waiting
for news of her husband and son and is being comforted by friends.
On Ben Nevis the search for the body of Manchester climber Anthony
Marsh was also called off.
He fell through a snow cornice near the summit of Britain's highest
peak on Saturday, February 18.
Weather conditions have been so severe on the mountain that no attempt
to find him could be made for several days after he was reported
missing.
The favourable conditions the searchers have been praying for have
come too late and now efforts to find him have been abandoned.

JOHN MAJOR looked last night to have ensured a victory in Wednesday's
crucial Commons vote on European policy, with signs that most of the
nine whipless Tory MPs are preparing to abstain or vote with the
Government.
Several days of back-room negotiations and an assurance yesterday from
Tory chairman Jeremy Hanley that the way is clear for the rebels to
return to the party fold appear to have done the job for the Prime
Minister.
Labour has made clear it does not expect to win the vote. Its motion,
which Mr Major has decided to answer personally, has not found support
with Tory Euro-rebels.
Attention has turned instead to the horse-trading between the
Government and the rebels, whose votes are considered crucial in part
because of uncertainties over the support of the Ulster Unionists.
As part of the negotiations between both sides, Mr Major is under
pressure to clarify his position on a single currency as the price for
rebel support on Wednesday.
With both sides giving out signals that a compromise is possible, Mr
Major has been asked to state unequivocally that Britain will never
agree to European monetary union.
Writing in The Herald today, Wolverhampton South West MP Nicholas
Budgen calls on Mr Major to agree that the conditions he has set for
Britain's entry into a single currency are unachievable and form
''permanent barriers'' against it.
Mr Budgen's intervention is the latest in the round of Euro-exchanges
set off by Mr Major's decision to answer personally Labour's motion,
effectively making the vote a matter of confidence.
With doubts over the voting intentions of the nine Ulster Unionist
MPs, who threaten to withhold their support for the Tories over the
Government's framework document for Northern Ireland, the votes of the
nine whipless Tories are essential to the Government's arithmetic.
Although the rebels are holding out for concessions from the
Government, only two -- Mr Tony Marlow and Sir Richard Body -- are said
to be ready to vote with Labour.
The rest are believed to be reluctant to support a party whose
policies on Europe they find even less acceptable, and the expectation
is now that they will at worst abstain.
One, Southend East MP Sir Teddy Taylor, has offered a compromise based
on Government promises of tighter immigration controls and a guarantee
that any decision to fix the pound to other European currencies would be
submitted to a vote in Parliament.
Mr Hanley yesterday sought to exploit the rebels' desire to regain the
whip by reminding them that their return, always conditional on their
voting record, could be accelerated by the way they vote on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, however, the pressure on Mr Major to give ground continued,
with an intervention from former Chancellor Lord Lawson, who called for
a promise that Britain would not enter a single currency without a
referendum.
From the Euro-enthusiast side, former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath
pressed Mr Major to spell out the positive vision of Europe with which
he entered Downing Street.
Mr Major faces renewed difficulties with his back benchers over
sleaze, as the Commons Privileges Committee completes its six-month
investigation into the MPs cash-for-questions scandal, which saw two MPs
resign junior Government posts for accepting #1000 payments to ask
questions in the House.
According to Sunday newspaper reports, Mr David Tredinnick, MP for
Bosworth, and Mr Graham Riddick, MP for Colne Valley, face being fined
or temporarily suspended from Parliament.
Another, Tayside North MP Bill Walker, who admitted accepting a
payment but on behalf of his favourite charity, allegedly faces the
equivalent of a reprimand.

THERE were increased calls yesterday for a total ban on professional
boxing, following the ringside collapse of American boxer Gerald
McClellan at WBC super-middleweight title fight. His opponent, the
British boxer Nigel Benn, hinted he might quit the sport.
Among those demanding a ban was Mr Sam Galbraith, a neurosurgeon and
the Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden.
''How many more people have to die or be maimed before we call a
halt?'' asked Mr Galbraith, who made a special study of head injuries to
boxers when he worked as a neurosurgeon at the Southern General
Hospital, Glasgow.
''Surely in a civilised society this sort of assault cannot
continue,'' he said. ''Medical back-up is all very well, but it really
comes in too late. The purpose of boxing is to inflict brain damage,''
he said.
Although speaking against Labour Party policy, Mr Galbraith called
upon the Government to act against professional boxing.
''All it requires is the political will to do it. The Government, with
all its other problems, does not want to get into something like this --
MPs would rather bring in bills about animals than humans,'' he said.
The contest, in which Benn put McClellan down for the full count in
round 10 of a brutal contest, has reopened the debate about safety in
boxing.
Although tighter medical controls have been introduced in recent years
-- two doctors, an anaesthetist, two para-medic teams, and an ambulance
were standing by at Saturday's fight -- some medical experts believe
that the only way to ensure boxers' safety is to ban the professional
sport.
Mr Galbraith did not call for a ban on amateur boxing, pointing out
that not only did it produce many social benefits, but it was also far
more rigorously controlled.
McClellan, 27, had been expected to beat Benn, 31. Since September
1990, McClellan had completed only 10 rounds in a total of 14 fights, as
he knocked over a succession of opponents in the early rounds,
demonstrating his impressive punching power.
A 12,000 capacity crowd in the London Arena on the Isle of Dogs, in
London's Docklands, saw McClellan slump on his haunches and then slip
flat on his back. He was given oxygen, his neck was put in a brace, and
injections were administered, and then taken to the Royal London
Hospital's trauma unit.
Yesterday, neurosurgeon John Sutcliffe, who spent much of the night
operating to remove a blood clot from McClellan's brain, said the boxer
had a ''good chance'' of surviving.
He told a news conference at the Royal London Hospital: ''It would be
fair to say he is stable, but things could take a change for the better
or worse over the next 48 hours.''
Mr Sutcliffe, who is a member of the British Boxing Board of Control
committee which is due to report on better medical care for fighters
later this year, said he did not believe boxing should be banned.
But he added: ''I wondered at the end of the first round if Nigel Benn
was going to be the candidate I would be seeing.''
Among the audience at Saturday night's fight was the former British
boxer Michael Watson who suffered a similar injury almost four years ago
in a fight with Chris Eubank. He is only partially recovered and is
confined to a wheelchair.
Benn was also given a medical examination after the fight. Yesterday,
he appeared dazed and was choked with emotion as he spoke falteringly to
reporters outside his home in Beckenham, Kent, and suggested he might
end his boxing career after his ''empty'' victory.
He said: ''It's not that I can't take it, but I'm not going to take a
battering like that again in my life. Maybe if he is all right it will
be different. I've been up all night thinking about Gerald McClellan. I
just feel so empty.
''It may have been a superb fight, but at the end of the day someone
was injured and it has taken it all away. It (the title victory) does
not mean anything now. I am very, very upset about it. I'm very
distressed with the way things went.''
He added: ''I'm in a lot of pain myself. I've never been like this
before. I feel battered from pillar to post. I feel dizzy.''
His manager Peter De Freitas, who visited the hospital to find out how
McClellan was faring, gave no indication, however, that Benn planned to
give up fighting.
He said: ''Nigel is very upset by what has happened. He is very, very
sore himself. We thought he had a broken jaw but it's just heavy
bruising on his face. Nigel said that man punches like a donkey kicks.''
He said Benn would have three more fights in defence of the WBC title
before the end of the year.
''Nigel will want to retire at the end of this year anyway, but we
will fight in Britain. This guy McClellan was brought here for a
mission, to take our championship belt back, and he failed,'' he said.
The managers of both boxers were both angry that the fight officials
were unable to speak English. But Mr De Freitas described allegations
that the referee had allowed Benn too long to recover from his first
round knock-down as ''a disgrace''.
The British Medical Association yesterday renewed its appeal to ban
boxing. A spokesman said: ''How many more cases do we need of boxers
playing roulette with their brains before the Government and the Board
of Control take seriously what we say about the cumulative danger that
boxing does.
''In the past (the British Boxing Board of Control) said that we were
being zealots about it, but in our view thhere is medical evidence that
is quite clear.'' He added that the BMA would like to see blows to the
head banned.
But a Department of Health spokesman said last night's tragedy did not
strengthen the case for outlawing boxing.
He said: ''If we banned boxing it would go underground and it would
not be regulated as it is now.''
Mr Gerry Woolard, an administrative steward of the British Boxing
Board of Control, said he did not believe that a ban would ever be
implemented.
''It is a dangerous sport and we accept it is a dangerous sport. But
in Britain I believe we have the finest administration and medical
controls there can be at this time. We do every mortal thing we can to
make it as safe a sport as we possible can,'' he said.
Labour sports spokesman and former boxer Tom Pendry called for full
reassurances that the BBBC was doing everything in its power to minimise
the risk of injury.
''Labour rejects the idea of a ban on boxing. A ban would serve only
to drive the sport underground where unregulated bouts would prove far
more dangerous and where the Queensberry rules would not apply,'' he
said.

A FISHERMAN was lost at sea last night and his five crewmates rescued
when their boat sank after being involved in a collision with a
2300-tonne North Sea supply vessel.
The 11-year-old Arbroath-registered Sharridale, a 72ft, 50-tonne seine
netter, had only sailed out of Aberdeen yesterday afternoon following a
three-day break.
She was 20 miles east of Peterhead on her way to the fishing grounds
in ''near perfect visibility'' when the collision occurred with the
Hamburg-registered Huntetor, a 2341-tonne oil supply vessel owned by OIL
Ltd of Aberdeen.
The fishing vessel sank almost immediately and the Huntetor, which
suffered no significant damage, launched a fast rescue craft which was
able to pick up five of the crew.
The missing fisherman was last night named by police as Mr Gordon
Smith, 40, of Rossie Street, Arbroath.
His fellow crew members were named as skipper Neil Teviotdale, of
Monymusk Road, Mr George Teviotdale, 43, of Noltiloan Road, Mr David
Teviotdale, 30, of Bellevue Gardens, and Mr James Smith, 34, also of
Bellevue Gardens, all Arbroath.
Police were witholding the name of one other survivor until relatives
had been informed.
A coastguard spokesman said the beacon from the sunken vessel was
giving them a very accurate position on which to centre their search.
Members of skipper Neil Teviotdale's family have been fishermen for
several generations. Mr Teviotdale's brother was lost at sea in a
fishing accident several years ago. His late father survived the loss of
his fishing boat.
The Sharridale survivors were last night brought into Aberdeen on
board the Huntetor as the search for Mr Smith continued.
The Department of Transport's Marine Accident Investigation Branch is
to hold an inquiry into the incident.

THE Bank of England Governor, Mr Eddie George, last night pulled down
the shutters on Barings, London's oldest merchant bank, in Britain's
worst banking crash this century.
The bank, which has the Queen as a customer, had run up losses of more
than #500m as a result of unauthorised dealing by a trader in its
Singapore office. He has gone missing.
There were fears last night of a global knock-on effect. The collapse
saw the pound fall sharply in early trading in New Zealand, the world's
first financial market to open for Monday dealing, and then hit an
all-time low in Sydney. The Tokyo Nikkei share average fell below 17,000
for the first time in 14 months.
The bank's 4000 employees worldwide, half of them in London at its
headquarters at Bishopsgate in the City, could lose their jobs. The
bank's total capital of #541m has been virtually wiped out.
It has now ceased trading and has been placed under administration.
The move followed 48 hours of frantic discussions.
The financial advisers, Ernst &amp; Young, have been brought in as
administrators to see if the bank could be sold in the long-term or if
it should be wound up, in which case the firm would act as liquidator.
There had been hopes a ''lifeboat'' could have been launched to save
Barings. However, these were doomed as Barings still has contracts open
on transactions which could total #2500m.
The eventual size of the losses will be known only when the contracts
expire or are closed out.
The trader involved, Mr Nick Leeson, from the bank's Singapore office,
has not been seen since Thursday. Mr Leeson, and possibly another
colleague, spent huge sums of money speculating through derivatives,
complicated financial instruments, from Singapore on the Tokyo stock
market, only to see the investments collapse as the deals went wrong.
Derivatives offer huge rewards, but the risks are equally great. They
are financial instruments for participating in a vast variety of markets
ranging from government securities, stock market indices to commodities
such as coffee and copper.
Mr Leeson had bought around 20,000 contracts each worth #120,000 based
on the movement of the Nikkei 225 futures contract traded on the Osaka
Securities Exchange, the second biggest in Japan.
If the gamble had paid off, Barings would have made huge profits and
he would have been entitled to a very substantial bonus. He was trying
to exploit the price differentials between cash stocks and futures.
The Bank of England will supply liquidity to the banking system. There
is the possibility of yet further pressure on sterling, but analysts do
not believe that there will be any immediate increase in UK interest
rates as a result of the Barings failure.
It remains unclear why such huge dealings had not been picked up by
the authorities and by the bank itself and whether there was any attempt
made by Mr Leeson to conceal his activity through phantom deals to cover
the true state of affairs.
The multi-billion pound global derivatives business came about when
stock brokers were dreaming up new ways of increasing business in the
late 1980s after the world stock market crash of 1987.
There have been other financial crises in recent years such as the
#150m collapse of Johnson Matthey Bankers 11 years ago and Bank of
Credit and Commere International in 1991. But this is the first case
where derivatives have brought a bank to its knees, with the unknown
factor being the possible impact on other banks and institutions such as
pension funds on the other side of the contracts.
Barings has specialised more than any other British bank in the Far
East which accounts for around half its profits. Although comparatively
small in the overall league table, it has developed a niche in some
areas to the extent that it is the biggest broker in the Philippines as
well as being one of the leading players in Singapore.
The Bank of England had to perform a similar supporting action for
Barings in 1890 after The Argentine defaulted on its loans which almost
brought about collapse of the bank.
Barings was described in 1818 by French soldier and statesman Duc de
Richelieu as the sixth great power in Europe, alongside England, France,
Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The bank found the money to fund the
Napoleonic Wars and was at that time the most powerful financial
institution in the world.
The first Baring, Johann, arrived in Britain in 1717 from Bremen. He
went to live in Exeter and became a wool merchant. Two of his sons, John
and Francis, started the bank in London in 1762.
It is still run by the Baring family and senior directors, although
voting control is in the hands of the charitable Baring Foundation.
