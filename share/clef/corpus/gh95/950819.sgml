THE main rural industries in agriculture, food, leisure and tourism
must be seen within the context of a closely inter-related economic and
business framework, Professor Phil Thomas, principal of the Scottish
Agricultural College, said yesterday.
Speaking at a college awards ceremony at Auchincruive, near Ayr, he
told students: ''Success rests firmly on a careful and sensitive
management of rural land and environmental resources -- thus economic
success and environmental sustainability go hand in hand.''
Professor Thomas emphasised the importance of the role to be played by
trained graduates in the current debate about determining the future of
rural areas.
The public's demands on the countryside were greater than ever before
and both the economic viability and the environmental sustainability of
rural areas were of the highest priority.
However, much of the present debate about the future was polarised
into a series of narrow factional arguments supported by particular
pressure groups, which failed to reflect the overall need and often
lacked objectivity.
''In these circumstances it is crucially important that those who are
trained in relevant technologies and business specialism engage in the
debate. They have the perspective to provide the balanced views and
constructive proposals,'' said Prof Thomas.

THOSE in the farming industry and on the fringe of it who knock the
Common Agricultural Policy are doing the industry a great disservice,
according to John Cameron, one of Scotland's largest farmers and a
former president of the NFU.
Mr Cameron yesterday said: ''No-one should be, and I don't believe any
farmer is naive enough to believe there will be no changes in the
present arrangements in the near future.
''Each year sees changes in rates and eligibility criteria and of
course, this type of change will continue to take place and indeed it is
logical that it should.''
He added: ''What I take issue with is the forecast of major structural
revisions of the present system, along with the usual supposedly
intellectual remark that 'it's too good to last', as if that
automatically meant it had to change. There are probably some sections
of the industry who would challenge the 'too good' allegations.
''Be that as it may, I would certainly not quarrel with anyone who
made such statements, provided they could substantiate them. No-one ever
gained anything from a head in the sand attitude.
''Certainly I would have no objection to anyone forecasting a
pessimistic future if it were based on a realistic assessment.
''Indeed, such dire warnings would be doing the industry a good turn.
My question is, what and where is the evidence that is going to lead to
this major structural change which is going to befall us, and which
should now be causing all of us to 'reconsider our future farming
policies'.''
Mr Cameron has been consistent in his support of the CAP -- not just
because he is one of the principal beneficiaries, but also on practical
grounds.
He said: ''It can be argued that the present CAP, while not perfect
is, broadly speaking, achieving its objectives, in that it is now more
quality based, more environmentally based, more orientated in the
maintenance of the social infrastructure and in cost terms moving in the
right direction.
''Agricultural spending now amounts to less than 60% of the total
budget, compared with 80% some years ago. Even in EU political terms, I
do not detect, apart from within the UK and possibly Holland, any desire
for the type of major policy change which is now being postulated.''
Defending the CAP still further against its critics, Mr Cameron
commented: ''Intervention stocks, which were the biggest negative
factors of the Gatt, are now diminishing fast.
''Even the loudest international critics of the CAP are now mollified.
Indeed, with recent major adverse weather factors in several parts of
the world there is now a real possibility of shortages rather than
surpluses.''
And in a final rejoinder to the prophets of doom, he added: ''I well
remember as president of the union occasionally having to warn of the
effects of talking our industry down, and whilst I believe that some of
those who advocate the doom and gloom scenario are genuinely of that
belief, I would caution them to think well, and consider the factual
evidence.
''Perhaps a word of endorsement for the present CAP and a word of
support for those who formed it and administer it and look after our
interests might be more appropriate.''

IRONICALLY, this week's trailblazing company, Empteezy of Livingston,
has built its spectacular success on the efforts of its customers to
erase, rather than to blaze, their own trails. For Empteezy is in the
business of environmentally-friendly waste disposal.
Over the past decade or so, public awareness has been growing of the
environmental damage which can result from the careless disposal of
industrial waste. At the same time, companies have become much more
conscious of the importance of presenting a clean and tidy face to the
world. So the market for efficient, cost-effective methods of disposing
of industrial waste, ranging from scrap metal, rubble, glass and waste
paper to hazardous chemicals, has increased enormously.
Empteezy was founded by managing director Bruce Wishart in 1986 to
exploit what he even then recognised as an expanding and profitable
niche in the waste disposal market. From its spartan beginnings in
Broxburn in a Nissan hut left over from the Second World War, with no
water or toilet facilities, but with #2000 and a telephone, Empteezy has
grown to employ 58, most of whom work in its 40,000 sq ft purpose-built
factory. And, says Mr Wishart, with his output selling to businesses the
length and breadth of the UK, there is scarcely a blue-chip manufacturer
which has not bought its products.
But just what are these trailblazing items every
environmentally-friendly business is so anxious to acquire? They
comprise two main categories and, though there is nothing
technologically sophisticated about them, they have been specifically
designed for their purpose.
By the late eighties, companies whose manufacturing processes required
waste disposal were turning increasingly to larger and larger skips. But
the economies of scale these afforded were offset by the difficulties
and dangers employees faced attempting to fill them. In response to
this, Mr Wishart developed an auto-dumping container which could be used
by every ordinary fork-lift truck. They have hinged bases so they can be
opened from the fork-lift cab, enabling loads to be dumped into skips of
every height quickly and safely.
At first he had their manufacture sub-contracted to another company.
But within a year or two his potential sales volume was such that he
opened his own factory. At the same time, he was looking at other
aspects of waste handling, and seeing a market for related fork-lift
attachments -- auto-tipping skips and pallets, trolleys, scoops and
hoppers -- he started manufacturing these as well.
He was also beginning to look abroad, where, he says, the Continental
Europeans and the Americans are far ahead of us in their management of
waste disposal, and where the regulations covering liquid chemical waste
are much stricter. It is only a matter of time, he believes, before
unsightly piles of tin drums, vulnerable to rusting, leaking and
spilling, will be outlawed here too.
When that day comes, he will be ready, for Empteezy has developed an
environmentally-sound solution to the problems drum storage. Again,
there is no complicated technology involved. It has produced a wide
range of drum storage units -- pallets and trolleys, stands and secure
holders of various sizes -- as well as offering custom-made systems. All
have sumps which, by collecting any hazardous spillage, prevent soil
contamination or water pollution.
Sales growth of these storage systems has been so dramatic that they
now account for some 65% of total turnover -- which has been growing by
25% a year. More than 90% of Empteezy's business is with firms based
south of the Border, where drinking water supplies are particularly
vulnerable to contamination. There is no doubt this reflects a new
understanding of the potential dangers of leaking chemicals: one pint of
motor oil, for example, can pollute 100,000 gallons of drinking water.

GEORGE Square in Glasgow will be a colourful place tomorrow when
almost 200 competitors take part in the Commonwealth Traditional Dancing
Championships.
David McGirr, managing director of Nambarrie (Scotland), will be in
attendance as his company is sponsoring the Highland dancing events for
those up to the age of 16.
He will present the young winners with Nambarrie's soft toy mascot
Barrie Bunny, and will be hoping that at least some of those coming
forward will have a Scottish accent -- last year it seems the Canadian
competitors danced off with most of the trophies.
It should be quite a day, and worth going along to see with
competitors from Canada, the US, Australia, Germany, Africa and, of
course, Scotland taking part.
Bubbly toast to water of life
I HAD a very pleasant evening as a guest of the Bank of Scotland at
the Edinburgh Tattoo recently.
The evening began with a visit to the Scottish Whisky Heritage Centre
on the Royal Mile, where we boarded a miniature train to be taken along
a trail depicting the 300-year-old history of whisky.
The 10-minute ride was very impressive and a tape extolling the
virtues of our national drink very informative. It ended by explaining
that today the entire world -- from America to Europe and Japan -- likes
a dram.
Everyone everywhere is enjoying the delights of Scotch, but not, it
turned out, our little party. At the following reception Lanson
champagne flowed freely but there was not a single dram to be had.
The champagne, I have to say, was excellent. There was something
ironic about holding a champagne reception in the Scottish Whisky
Centre, but cheers anyway.
Away to a high flying start
IAIN Paterson, managing partner of accountancy firm Moores Rowland,
took to the air earlier this week for a lesson with the Glasgow Flying
Club.
Soaring along at 2000ft, looking like something out of a Biggles book,
he took the controls to fly over his native town of Greenock before
heading towards Loch Lomond.
Making sure that he avoided colliding with 3195ft Ben Lomond, he
pointed his two-seater plane in the direction of Glasgow Airport.
After arriving safely on terra firma, he told me: ''It was a very
enjoyable experience although a little nerve wracking. It was certainly
worse than advising clients.''
The flying lesson was a birthday present from two partners of
solicitor Bird Semple, Jack Gardiner and Gordon Hollerin. But Paterson
has yet to figure out their motive -- he certainly cannot remember
particularly upsetting them.
Pinnacle of typhoon terror
NIALL Lothian, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland, would have swopped seats with Iain Paterson any day. While the
latter was admiring the sun-bathed landscape below him, Lothian was
stuck in a hotel bedroom as 100mph winds battered Hong Kong.
In height stakes, he was not far below Paterson as his bedroom was on
the 31st floor, which meant he felt the full force of Typhoon Helen as
it swept between the colony's tall buildings.
All the hotel residents were warned to shut their curtains and stay in
their rooms until further notice. Lothian, who was in Hong Kong running
a financial analysis course for executives of international companies,
was trapped in his room for eight hours before the all-clear was given.
The reason for closing the curtains was for protection against
possible flying glass, although he admits to having had a quick peep
out. He has told colleagues it was ''pretty scary, watching bamboo
scaffolding being ripped from nearby buildings''.
To take his mind off what was happening outside, he watched the US PGA
golf on the telly, and reckons that the finish by Colin Montgomerie was
just as nail-biting as his own experience.
Off on a crafty expedition
BUSINESS Diary hopes the 85 pensioners heading off to St Andrews today
on a trip organised by Trades House in Glasgow have a good day out.
The pensioners, who come from all 14 of the crafts represented by the
house, will be having lunch at the Old Course Hotel. The outing was
organised by the 10-person committee under the chairmanship of Robin
Brown, a chartered civil engineer and a member of the Hammermen Craft,
which organises summer and winter events for craft pensioners as well as
providing assistance with gardening and decorating.
Have a nice day.
Trusting to power of words
AROUND a 100 senior representatives from the NHS in Scotland,
including trusts and health boards, will be attending a conference on
Wednesday in the Stirling Management Centre, where they will hear
Francis Gibb, general manager of the Common Services Agency, speak.
The Scottish Healthcare Forum has been organised by the Scottish
Biomedical Association. It hopes the conference will explore
opportunities for partnerships and joint projects between members,
helping the sector create jobs and become a force in the country's
economic development.
Topics under discussion will include the Private Finance Initiative
and the changes being made in NHS procurement. Details of the conference
can be obtained from the Scottish Biomedical Association on 0141 945
1934.
The secret of winning ways
YOUR secret is out, all you clever people who came up with the correct
answer to our recent competition.
We asked readers to tell us what the connection was between the Church
of Scotland hymn Thine Be The Glory and the defeat of the Jacobites at
Culloden. Lo and behold, did not every reader entering the competition
get the correct answer and receive a copy of the Royal Bank of Scotland
booklet The Diary of John Campbell, penned by the bank's chief cashier
at the time of the Jacobite rebellion.
But David Landale of Bearsden, a retired Bank of Scotland manager on
less, reckons that he knows where everyone got their information --
Glasgow's art gallery and museum at Kelvingrove.
He gave me a call and chuckling asked: ''Do you know why your readers
are so clever?'' Admitting that I did not, he then proceeded to tell me
the answer to the question is on display at a Jacobite exhibition
currently running in the gallery. He was honest enough to admit that
this is where he learned it himself.
Before indignant winners write in denying his scurrilous allegation, I
am sure he is not totally correct. For example, I don't think Mrs I
Patrick of Falkirk trailed all the way to the West End of Glasgow to
find the answer. However, no doubt Landale was not alone in his
ingenuity.
The booklet should now be with our winners, and just in case any
readers were on holiday when we published the answer -- and to save them
a trip to the art gallery -- the answer is that the tune was composed to
honour Butcher Cumberland's return to London after his victory over the
Jacobites.

Bond fund to launch
MURRAY Johnstone is to launch a corporate bond fund eligible for a PEP
at the end of the month. It will invest in bonds with maturities of
between five and 15 years, and will also from time to time put money in
other sterling fixed-interest securities. Running yield will be 8.1%.
Initially it will be 90% invested in corporate bonds, 5% in cash and 5%
in gilts, and will be managed by Chris McGinty, head of fixed interest
at Murray Johnstone, which manages #600m in these markets.
The only charges will be 1% initial and 0.75% annual. Through the
self-select PEP, investors can split their investments between various
Murray funds at no extra cost. Minimum investment in the new fund will
be #1000 and income will be paid out quarterly or bi-annually.
100% mortgage offer
COLONIAL Direct has a new mortgage targeted at those requiring a 100%
loan at a rate of 8.99% fixed until August 2000. Funded by a major
clearing bank, the rate will revert to 0.5% above the lender's normal
variable mortgage rate at the end of the fixed period. Borrowers are
allowed up to an additional #1500 on top of the loan to cover indemnity
and legal fees.
New gold Visa card
CITIBANK has launched a new gold Visa credit card incorporating a
colour photograph of the card holder and his or her signature in printed
form for increased security. Services available include a temporary
replacement card or emergency cash 24 hours a day anywhere in the world
should the card be stolen.
Trust share placing
INVESCO Asset Management has announced the placing of 15 million
shares in INVESCO Convertible Trust, which is designed to generate an
above average reliable yield, with the prospect of capital growth
without undue risk. The trust will qualify for inclusion in a PEP.

<HEADLINE>Glasgow-based inventor Billy Harkin is keen to help others achieve similar commercial success. Innovative approach to invention</HEADLINE>

BILLY Harkin is 36 and has an unquenchable enthusiasm for inventing
things. If all goes well his latest product, aimed at the health and
beauty market, with 10 million target customers, will hit the High
Street shelves of at least one well-known retailing name in the near
future.
Mr Harkin lives in Glasgow's West End, but product development has so
far been financed in Dublin, while manufacturing, packaging and
distribution will take place in Northen Ireland, although some component
parts may well be sourced in Scotland.
The Irish connection is partly explained by the fact that he was born
in Donegal and spent a sizeable slice of his adult business career in
County Wicklow. And, in finding a way through what he calls the
invention maze facing innovators like him, he believes we Scots have a
lot to learn from the Irish.
He also thinks that more needs to be done to help others with
innovative product ideas. So he is proposing to spend some of his time
in future -- for a fee, of course -- acting as a tour guide through the
maze.
Though born in Donegal -- his parents are in the supermarket business
-- he was raised in the West of Scotland. He worked as an apprentice in
Yarrows but, by 20, was back in Ireland, starting his own business.
He insists -- and this is an important sub-text in Scotland's current
drive to encourage more people to set up in business -- that the Irish
are, in general, much more entrepreneurial than the Scots. ''I have nine
brothers and sisters,'' he says. ''Half are culturally Irish, half are
culturally Scottish. The difference is dramatic. The Scottish ones are
all working for someone, the Irish all have their own businesses.''
His own first venture was providing heating and other mechanical
services to domestic and commercial customers. One day the founder of
one of Ireland's biggest supermarket chains asked if he could tackle a
refrigeration problem at a store 30 miles away. That lead to other
similar work, such as installing laundry equipment for a jeans
manufacturer.
''I was making six times what I made at Yarrows. The work was
seasonal, but when we were busy we were eating, drinking and sleeping on
the job. I suppose running around with a van full of kit is fine when
you're young, but I was paying a lot of tax and wasn't sure how much
further I could grow the thing.''
Under section 35 of the Irish tax code, all creative activity enjoys a
waiver of taxes. That is usually portrayed as creating a tax haven for
writers and musicians, but it applies to inventors too.
''I couldn't sing or dance,'' he says, ''so I looked at the notebook
of all the jobs we had done, searching for a creative idea.'' He struck
on the notion of portable dishwashers. In the mid-eighties, dishwashers
were still an unusual appliance in Europe, with many kitchens simply too
small to accommodate one. There was already a Belgian version on the
market, but it took up a lot of worktop space. What he came up with was
something which fitted into the standard sink bowl and would take four
place settings.
He approached the Irish Industrial Development Authority in Dublin. In
no time it had him in Tokyo, talking to some big Japanese consumer goods
corporations about a device which ought, given space contraints in
Japanese homes, to have had appeal there too. The IDA, of course, was
looking for a Japanese company which would manufacture for the European
market back in Ireland.
Negotiations reached an advanced stage with one particular large
company. But, eventually, it decided not to proceed. He was not best
pleased. The suspicion was that the product would eventually appear, in
a modified guise, but with no royalty cheques flowing to Dublin.
Litigation was out of the question. So he decided to learn his lesson
and push on.
He did not come back from Japan entirely empty handed though. He had
secured exclusive agencies to market a range of consumer electronics
items. But the invention bug had bitten. Other products followed,
including a portable fire front, child safety equipment, a laser device
and now the under-wraps health and beauty product.
In 1989 Mr Harkin and his Scots-born wife returned to Glasgow. He
completed an engineering degree and began to tread the Scottish maze
facing inventors. He is largely dismissive of the help offered by the
enterprise agencies who, with few exceptions he believes, still treat
inventors as Back to the Future cranks.
Finding your way through the confusion of engineering design, patent
law, finance, project management and marketing is enough to put most
inventors off long before they reach an outcome. That is where the idea
of using his own experience of the hurdles to be overcome began. For
Billy Harkin cares passionately about sustaining Scotland's reputation
as a country which gave the world many of its best commercial ideas in
the past.
Britain was responsible for radar technology, he points out. The
technicians developing it used to heat their sausage rolls using the
microwaves from the prototype equipment. But it was the Japanese who saw
the commercial potential and now supply most of the world with microwave
ovens.

TO have some measure of the accomplishment of Frank McGuinness's play,
it's worth itemising the things he doesn't do. A war play about an
Ulster regiment heading to unavoidable death on the fields of Flanders
in 1914, this is neither the boy's own adventure of Bill Bryden's The
Big Picnic, not the pacifist pageantry of Joan Littlewood's Oh What a
Lovely War.
Setting himself those familiar situations -- the camaraderie, the
class conflict, the all-consuming fear -- McGuinness brings himself to
the edge of cliche, then twists and turns to surprise us, involve us
and, importantly, to make us think.
And though this is a play written by a Catholic about a fiercely
Protestant group of soldiers, its supreme humanist glory -- the reason
director Patrick Mason thought to revive it in this Abbey Theatre
production after the Northern Irish ceasefire -- is that it resists all
temptation to condemn, to chide, or to sneer.
These eight men in McGuinness's vision are part of the inexorable flow
of history, not wrong or right, not stupid or manipulated, but fated and
somehow tragically aware of their own fate -- like intelligent lemmings
with an irresistible death-wish, playing roles that are at once within
their grasp and beyond their power.
He is of course intolerant of religious bigotry, but he shows it less
in his portrayal of the men and their routine Catholic hating, than in
his presentation of their story. These men are not going to war against
anything so much as the unknown, and what gives them real motivation is
their unyielding belief in their hard-bitten and persecuted culture. And
it takes the overwhelming loss of war, the unifying bloodshed (blood is
a recurrent image from start to finish), that begins to make the hard
shell of dogma crack.
As boldly conceived as it is crisply realised in Mason's studio-like
production (a spare, elegant set design by Joe Vanek), Observe the Sons
of Ulster is a profoundly moving, deeply unsettling meditation, not just
on the nature of war, not just on the fabric of a religiously divided
society, but on the ties that bind us together as human beings.
Staged with a knowing, measured pace and lovingly acted, this is a
tremendous piece of theatre.

Your questions answered by R E Dundas, Christopher Sims and Valerie
Smart
* I am a little worried about my employment position as there is a
possibility of my employer being sold to another company. I am
considering taking out insurance against redundancy, so that if the
worst comes to pass at least my mortgage costs will be met.
But I am wondering if those with an existing mortgage can take out a
policy and what criteria the companies use to assess premiums. And how
is redundancy defined? Would someone paid off for incompatibility, for
example, still receive a payout? Can you give me the names of some
companies I could try?
* The insurance industry has not been exactly falling over itself to
offer these policies despite the Government's hope that it would do so.
However, the cover is certainly available, though not many companies
offer it for existing mortgage holders. In deciding whether to offer
cover the underwriters obviously try to assess the job security of the
individual concerned. Clearly this is worse for some than others. For
example, those employed in industries about to be privatised are
unlikely to find cover. One company also excludes oil rig workers. The
underwriters will consider the nature of the employer's business and the
length of service of the applicant.
Of itself, age is not very important, because although a company would
find it cheaper to lay off young people, therefore making them more
vulnerable, they are more likely to find new employment than older
workers. The most important question on the application form will be
whether the applicant is aware of any impending redundancies. Insurers
often protect themselves by excluding claims within three months of the
start of the policy, and would no doubt investigate the circumstances
should one arise, say, four months after the start.
The policies also pay out on illness so the form will include
questions on any health problems, particularly of a recurring nature.
Pre-existing conditions as a cause of losing employment would not be
covered.
The usual definition of redundancy is that the claimant must be
registered as unemployed and available for work. It will not matter if
it is genuine redundancy or a disguised sacking with a pay off.
Companies you could try for a quote are General Accident, John Charcol
(0171 589 4545), Sun Alliance (0800 221710) and National &amp; Provincial
Building Society. Expect to be charged between #5 and #7 per #100 of
monthly mortgage payment.
* After receiving my contents insurance renewal note I had another
attempt at roughly totting up the replacement value of what I have in my
house. I reckon this would come to some #60,000, which is #15,000 more
than the present insured value.
Pushing this up to the more realistic value would mean a big increase
in my premium and I think I am prepared to take the risk. After all, I
am only likely to lose the lot if the house burns to the ground, and I
have several smoke alarms. I know that the insurance company will only
pay a proportion of a claim if I am under-insured, but how can it
possibly know? I have a burglar alarm and window locks so I don't think
I am at great risk there. Have I forgotten something? Could I separate
the fire from burglary elements of the insurance?
* If the company smelled a rat it could send an assessor round to
check whether the insured value reflected the real value of your
contents. However, there is no reason why it should have any such
suspicions and if there was a total loss it would pay up the full
insured value. A total loss is improbable though. It is much more likely
that one or two rooms would be damaged or destroyed before the fire was
brought under control. But the assessor might conclude from your
undamaged possessions that you had under-insured in which case the
payout would be scaled back.
As for burglary, tales of removal vans pulling up and gutting houses
are not entirely apocryphal. If you are prepared to accept some risk
then it is better to keep premiums in check through agreeing to pay the
first, say, #250 of a claim rather than be under-insured. Some companies
also offer no-claims reductions.
Standard contents policies always include fire and theft and the two
elements cannot be separated. No doubt you could go to a broker and get
a fire-only policy written, but it would not be cost effective.
* I am having a small dispute with a friend who says the benefits of a
free-standing AVC have to be taken when you retire from a company
pension scheme. I disagree. If it is free-standing surely it is
separate, unlike an AVC which I know is linked to the company scheme.
Who is right?
* Your friend is correct in normal circumstances. An AVC (additional
voluntary contribution) is arranged by the employer as an adjunct to his
or her pension scheme where employees want to improve on their
entitlement. The proceeds are paid out as additional pension on
retirement and the total pension has to be within the Inland Revenue
maximum limit of two-thirds final salary.
The free-standing AVC (FAVC) lives up to its name in that it is
arranged by the individual employee without necessarily any reference to
the employer. But the link with the pension scheme remains because when
retirement is taken the FAVC fund has to be used to buy an annuity and
the Inland Revenue limit still applies. So care has to be taken not to
over-fund the pension as there is a heavy tax clawback on any excess.
There is a way in which the FAVC can be separated from the pension
scheme. If the pension is not drawn but deferred when the employee
leaves the company, the link between the two is deemed to have been
broken and the benefits of the FAVC can be taken at any time between the
ages of 50 and 75. No further contributions can be made to it once the
individual leaves the company.
* There is a tax rule which allows a person to make a main residence
election where more than one property is owned. Does this apply only to
property in the UK or can the election be made for a house abroad? If
this can be done, does this property qualify for mortgage interest
relief?
* There are two separate points involved in this question which should
not be confused. Where you own more than one property you can elect
which is to be treated as your main residence for capital gains tax
purposes. The significance of this election is that the property to
which it applies is exempt from capital gains tax for the period covered
by the election. There is no geographical limitation which would prevent
this election applying to a property abroad. However, you should check
whether any gain may be subject to a foreign tax rendering the UK
exemption worthless.
There is no such election for income tax purposes and whether or not a
property is your main residence is a question of fact. Clearly it would
not be possible for anyone normally living in the UK to have their main
residence abroad, but in any event the rules for mortgage interest
relief state the property must be in the UK or Republic of Ireland.
* I understand that because my husband died during the last tax year I
am entitled to an extra tax allowance for widows which will be set
against my earnings. My husband's income consisted of pensions only and
in total was less than his tax allowances. The excess allowances were,
therefore, transferred to me. Will I still be entitled to the extra
widow's allowance?
* The widow's bereavement allowance is due to you for the tax year in
which your husband died and the following tax year. The amount of the
allowance is equal to the married couple's allowance and is due in
addition to the allowance transferred from your husband in the year of
death. It is, however, only any excess married couple's allowance which
will be transferred to you as the unused amount of any other allowance
is not transferable.
* I am about to purchase my first house and am considering the best
method of repayment. I am inclined to choose capital and interest
because of the bad publicity currently attaching to endowment returns.
Would this be wise?
* Since endowment policies are usually taken out over terms of 25
years it is difficult to make precise forecasts. But if you opt for the
capital and interest method you will certainly not be doing yourself any
harm. If your mortgage runs its full term the loan will be repaid. If it
does not, some of it will have been repaid, albeit only modest amounts
in the early years.
In the heyday of endowments, policyholders looked forward to large
surpluses after repaying their mortgages, but much of this was the
product of inflation. Now there is the fear that there will be
insufficient funds at the end of the day, though the insurance company
should alert the policyholder well in advance to such a possibility. The
other problem with endowments, many of which do not run their full
course, is poor surrender values. If a policy is given up in the early
years its value may be less than the premiums paid.
There is certainly more flexibility with the repayment method, but it
is also worth considering using personal equity plans to repay your
loan. These offer the chance of participating in the growth of equity
markets without the difficulties associated with endowments. The risk is
that you might want the capital when the market was depressed.
You could, of course, use more than one method to repay your mortgage,
which might give you the best of all worlds. But if your inclination is
to opt for the repayment route, you should have no qualms.
* I expect to be made redundant and am worried about the effect this
will have on my pension and life insurance arrangements. At present most
of my life insurance is arranged in conjunction with the pension scheme
of my employer.
What happens to this when I cease to be an employee (against my will)?
Is there any obligation on the company to maintain the insurance cover?
And what happens if I should die after I have left with respect to the
widow's pension? Also do I get my full deferred pension should I decide
to retire before the scheme's normal retirement age?
* With regard to the life insurance element you will find that this is
dependent on being a contributing member of the scheme, so it will not
continue when you leave, unless possibly you can come to some
arrangement with the company to pay the premiums.
When you leave its service you will have a deferred pension which has
to include something for your widow in the event of your death, but this
may be minimal. The scheme is obliged to pay you the guaranteed minimum
pension, which is the pension you would have got had you not opted out
of the state earnings related scheme when joining the company one. This
includes a guaranteed minimum widow's pension, which will only be a
small amount.
Most company schemes will pay more than this minimum, but you will
have to check the rules to know how much the extra might be. It could
range from just the return of contributions without interest to half
your pension. You will have to find out from your scheme booklet or from
the trustees what are the conditions applying in your case.
You will also have to do this to see how your pension will be
calculated if you stop work before the normal retirement age. There will
most likely be an adjustment to take account of this but other
variations are possible. In this case, you should also inquire about the
transfer value because it may be better to take a transfer into a
personal pension scheme and derive your retirement income from that.

DID they call it right this time? We have seen bounces in the Japanese
share market before when it appeared to make an apology for halving in
value in the past few years, and we have heard experts making reassuring
noises about it. We have also seen disappointments and setbacks -- even
an earthquake at Kobe -- to renew the worries and dash the hopes of the
battered investor.
So is it any different this time? There is some weighty support for
the argument that it is -- or certainly looks pretty much as if it might
be.
Global strategists at Smith New Court got in ahead of this week's
fireworks on the Tokyo foreign exchange and share markets with the
prediction in their August review that Japanese equities would
out-perform but that you should hedge the yen. They were not alone, but
it seems to have taken the concerted selling of yen and buying of
dollars to put the confidence back into the share market. The overweight
position the broker has been recommending for Japan for some weeks comes
from the belief that, with considerable spare capacity now available in
the economy, ''scope exists for a massive rebound in earnings per share
in coming years''.
A well-timed look at Japan also came from NatWest Securities with
Robin Angus asking whether it is it a sleeping giant or a beached whale,
and making the point that the time seemed to have come to make up one's
mind. Whichever image is in yours, the share market certainly gave an
impressive twitch when kicked by the currency market on Monday, rising
some 1200 points in two days.
NatWest strategist John Reynolds, writing at a time when the Nikkei
225 index was standing at 16,615, stuck his neck out for 20,000 in 12
months, a prediction which by Wednesday was looking more suited to a
rather conservative actuary than a bold stock market strategist. Mr
Reynolds is now revising his prediction upwards.
His firm's forecast price earnings ratio for Japan next year is 28.9,
a modest enough figure when you compare it with the telephone numbers
floating around when the Nikkei stood at above 39,000 a few years ago.
Last month began to see a flicker of life in Japan. Company profits
had risen in the first quarter of the year, the third successive one to
enjoy such movement. And the increase was worthwhile, 10.7%
year-on-year. It was accompanied by a 1.3% rise compared with a year ago
in capital investment by manufacturing industry, the first in 13
quarters.
Next year could see a major turnround in company profits. ''Earnings
could grow by 50%,'' says Mr Reynolds. ''Given the low levels to which
earnings have fallen over the last five years and the restructuring and
cost control measures that have taken place in Japanese industry, there
is a very sizeable operational gearing in corporate profits to a growth
of 3% or more in the economy as a whole.''
Perhaps the most important factors for Japan are the increased
confidence that the authorities really mean to ensure its still fragile
economic recovery remains intact, which probably means keeping the yen
down against the dollar, and the indications that corporate profits are
improving.
But Mr Reynolds also points to the bond market where 10-year bonds are
yielding below 3% which, he comments, gives no cushion against the
uptick in inflation which could be expected to accompany an economic
recovery even in Japan. With domestic investors still the most important
factor in the market, he expects Japanese institutions that are
overweight in bonds will switch into shares. Yields of 3% on domestic
bonds pose a problem for life companies contracted to provide returns in
the region of 3.75% and, faced with this and the possibility of capital
loss if interest rates rise, they will have to look elsewhere.
With the yen now seemingly at the end of its astonishing period of
strength, Japanese institutions may well be more inclined to resume
buying overseas, but Mr Reynolds says he also expects them to go for
domestic shares. And he stresses that 1% of the assets of Japanese
pension funds and life companies adds up to $15bn. Impressive stuff.
Even Robin Angus, self-confessed sceptic of anywhere east of Vienna,
admits to being partly convinced and has settled down at the keyboard to
pass on such useful information as the extent to which the various
specialist investment trusts are hedged against a fall in the yen and
how bullish -- or otherwise -- the managers are.
A poll taken by NatWest ahead of the market's sudden reach for the
skies ranged from caution at Perpetual Japanese -- ''over-optimism may
be misplaced'' -- to confidence at Edinburgh Japan which sees ''a potent
case for Japan''.
It has to be admitted that not everyone is sure the yen has weakened
decisively against the dollar. One prediction this week was for a rate
of 85 by the end of the year, compared with NatWest's thoughts of 91.6
or more.
Where the yen goes is likely to be important for the stock market,
which has been worrying about the impact of its strength. But it is
still worthwhile looking at NatWest's table of hedgers. This shows
Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon and HTR Japanese Smaller Companies are both
50% hedged, GT Japan is 46% hedged, Baillie Gifford Japan and Edinburgh
Japan 40%, Dunedin Japan 24% and Fleming Japanese (bigger than the
others put together) 18%.
NatWest calculates that its prediction for Tokyo should give a gross
total return of 21% over the next year from a base of 16,615 on the
index. For those attracted by the Pacific rim, but not totally convinced
about Japan, it expects 14% from Australia, 17% from Hong Kong and 15%
from Singapore. That compares with a 10% total return looked for from
the US and a mere 5% from the UK.

HAVE you been sitting back in the sunshine planning what you'll do
with Tessa? The first Tessas -- those Tax Exempt Special Savings
Accounts introduced in January 1991 -- will soon be five years old. And
that means an estimated #15bn available for spending, saving or
investment early next year.
Back in 1991 savers were tempted into Tessas with interest that now
looks almost unbelievable. Many offered 13% to 14% tax free, but the
rates on some topped 15%. If those juicy returns had continued
throughout the five-year term, savers could have been looking forward to
well in excess of #15,000 when they matured.
But, as we all know only too well, interest rates have plummeted since
1991 and maturity values are more likely to be around #12,000. That's
still a sizeable lump sum to have at your disposal and it's clear that
there will be some serious spending going on next year. Many of the
Tessa savers I've spoken to have earmarked the money for the holiday of
a lifetime.
In fact, it has been suggested that those of us without Tessas might
still be able to cash in, buying shares in companies that stand to
benefit if Tessa savers do decide to go on a spending spree. Shares in
holiday, hotel, leisure and cruise companies and travel agents such as
P&amp;O, Grand Metropolitan, Ladbroke and First Choice might all benefit. So
too could High Street names like Dixons if a new television, computer or
hi-fi is on the shopping list.
An increase in spending on luxuries such as a new car or even a boat
could give share prices of motor distributors Inchcape and Lex, and boat
builder Fairline Boats a push in the right direction, while a run on new
conservatories would add sparkle to Anglian Group.
Of course, there's much more to take into account when buying shares
than a potential, but probably short-term, boost from extra consumer
spending. And it is vital would-be investors consider the long-term
growth and dividend prospects before following their hunches.
It is also important for Tessa savers to think carefully if they are
simply planning to reinvest their money in another Tessa scheme. It may
be tempting just to roll the maturity value over to another with the
same organisation, but rates could be better elsewhere.
New offers for your Tessa money are already appearing but, while you
can switch your savings now, it could be better to wait and see what
sort of rates you'll be offered early next year. Remember too that
switching out of a Tessa early might mean hefty interest penalties and
the loss of valuable maturity bonuses wiping out the benefits of a move.
You have six months from the maturity date of your original Tessa to
put up to #9000 into a new one, but if there is a gap between your first
Tessa maturing and the next starting, any interest earned in the
meantime will be taxable.
Savers who put the maximum #9000 into a new Tessa won't be able to add
to their investment and all the tax-free interest built up in the
original plan will have to be withdrawn and reinvested in another type
of account.
If you miss the six month deadline or decide to put in less than the
full #9000 in the first year, you'll be able to go on saving over the
next four within the usual limits of #3000 in year one and up to #1800
in the next four.
It has been suggested a lot of the money coming out of Tessas could
find its way into the new corporate bond PEPs. They too are tax-free,
within certain limits, but are a completely different type of investment
from risk-free Tessas.
''Corporate bond PEPs are good news for investors seeking income,
particularly those looking to top up their pension,'' says Brian
McKenna, managing director of Glasgow financial adviser MGW. ''But
investors need to know what they are likely to receive and the risks
involved.''
It's also worth remembering that conventional unit and investment
trust PEPs, with their combination of capital and income growth, could
achieve a much better return over the longer term. New performance
figures from investment adviser Chase de Vere show the average annual
growth rate for unit trust PEPs over five years is 9.25%, rising to just
over 11% for the investment trust variety.

THE state is no longer prepared to write a blank cheque for the
long-term care of the elderly. For years, local councils have been
discreetly forcing them to sell their houses to meet the cost of nursing
home care. But it was the Government's Care in the Community policy,
introduced in April 1993, which seems to have brought the issue into the
limelight.
This week the problem even surfaced in the letters column of the Times
newspaper with opinion sharply divided as to the rights and wrongs of
getting the elderly to fund their own long-term care. Ben Furner of Age
Concern says a lot of elderly people feel betrayed by the Government.
''They have worked hard all their lives. They have paid their National
Insurance contributions but, now when they need it, the Government
refuses to pay up.''
Not surprisingly, a number of insurance companies have started selling
policies which cover the cost of long-term care. Commercial Union, the
first to offer long-term care insurance back in 1991, has noticed a big
upturn in demand for cover since the beginning of the year. CU's Ian
Frater says it sold three times as many policies in the first six months
as it did in all of the previous three years. ''We said when we launched
the policy that we would have to spend the first three or four years
educating people.''
The public's learning curve has undoubtedly taken a sharp upward turn
following the recent spate of scare stories, and you can't really blame
the insurance companies for exploiting the sales opportunity. However,
Age Concern worries that people may be persuaded to buy one of these
policies before they have taken a long, hard look at the facts.
And this week, the Continuing Care Conference, a lobbying and
educational organisation backed by the insurance companies active in
this field, called for regulation under the Financial Services Act.
There is no denying the National Health Service is cutting back on the
number of elderly people it has in long-term care. The number of
geriatric and psycho-geriatric beds has fallen from 75,000 in 1970 to
54,700 in 1994, a cut of over a quarter. In fact though the vast
majority of people will never need long-term care. At age 65, you have a
one in 10 chance of needing it and at age 80 the chance is still only
one in four.
You only have to pay for your own care in full if you have assets in
excess of #8000, which includes the family home, but you won't be forced
to sell if your spouse still lives there. And councils have discretion
not to force a sale if you shared it with a long-term carer, such as a
son or daughter.
Unless the elderly take to the streets to campaign for a change in the
law, the decision to take out long-term care insurance really depends on
whether or not you want to guarantee your offspring their inheritance.
The problem with insuring the risk is that it is expensive. The cost
of long-term care is now between #17,580 and #22,400 a year. If, like
most people, you have other sources of income such as pensions and
investments, you only need insure any excess you wouldn't be able to pay
out of these.
The possibility of ever needing to pay for long-term care seems so
remote while you are in robust good health, but as with all insurance
policies the earlier you start the cheaper they are. But even at age 45,
CU charges a basic premium of #36.70 a month for #15,000 a year of
long-term care cover. This rises to #44.65 a year at age 50, #56.35 at
55 and #70.60 at 60.
And it can be difficult to claim. To succeed you must be unable to
carry out three of the following activities of daily living or ADLs:
washing, dressing, eating and drinking, using the toilet, moving around
the house, getting in and out of bed. More extensive cover which pays
out if you are unable to carry out just two ADLs raises the premiums on
the CU policy to #42.40 a month at age 45, #51.55 at 50, #65.50 at 55
and #81.55 at 60.
It is always worth shopping around for premiums. Other companies
offering this type of insurance include Eagle Star, Hambro Assured Care,
PPP Lifetime, Scottish Amicable and the Armed Forces Financial Advisory
Services (AFFAS), which has a scheme available to former service
personnel and their families through the British Legion. This last
offers cheaper premiums if you opt for cover which is limited to a
number of years.
The average long-term care stay is 30 months and figures from the US
indicate that 90% of stays are for less than five years. By limiting
your cover to just three years you can reduce premiums by about a third.
However, there is some evidence that premiums overall are falling. CU
has already cut its rate once and there could be another in the
pipeline.
Age Concern has two factsheets (numbers 10 and 29) covering paying for
long-term care. There are also two briefing notes (numbers 64 and 66)
which set out how your home can be used as capital and the transfer of
assets. These are free to individuals and are available from Age Concern

EVERYONE -- including the Edinburgh Festival -- shortens the title of
The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevronia, yet
its length is wholly in keeping with Rimsky-Korsakov's leisurely
four-hour masterpiece, a work dependent on its unhurried, sometimes
quite Wagnerian flow, and thus on the prolonged patience of its
audience.
Last night's full house for the first of the Kirov Opera's two
performances at the Festival Theatre clearly had no trouble coping with
this rich but curious score, a kind of summing up of Rimsky's musical
experience, filled with his love for the worlds of nature and mythology,
brimming with symbolism, transformation scenes, forest murmurs, brutal
invaders and, in the character of Grishka, a memorable addition to the
gallery of tormented Russian madmen.
To cut huge chunks out of Kitezh would doubtless be easy but would
damage the sometimes trance-like unfurling of its action. Valery
Gergiev, resisting all temptation to over-press, obtained a measured but
powerful performance from his Kirov forces, not always perfect in detail
-- Galina Gorchakova was in disappointingly wobbly voice as the heroine
Fevronia -- but alive to Rimsky's range of sonorities, gloriously
realised by the Kirov orchestra with its rich, deep, bass tone, hovering
flutes, and resonant brass.
So strong and absolutely straightforward a realisation of the
composer's aims swept aside any elements of doubt that might have
existed about the piece itself or Andris Liepa's splendidly
old-fashioned production of it, complete with bears whenever Rimsky
demanded them.
Anatole Nezhny's scenery was of the sort that prompts audiences to
applaud at the sight of it, but again this seemed quite in keeping with
a performance that took Rimsky's opera at face value. Of the substantial
cast Konstantin Pluzhnikov's portrayal of the mad Grishka calls for
special mention, but there were several rewardingly dark Russian voices
to be heard before the opera finally wafted to sunlit rest in clouds of
Wagner's Parsifal.

THE effect of the invasion of Krajina was to ''liberate the people'',
no ethnic cleansing took place, if Mr Clayton is to be believed (August
9 and 14). He is in powerful company, the US ambassador made the same
assertion.
It is difficult to have a meeting of minds with someone who can stand
before an ocean of blood and swear that he sees only roses. However, I
would like to hear if either can explain why the ''well-disciplined''
Croat troops are burning hundreds of Serb villages (wanton destruction
of private property by occupying troops is itself a crime under the
Hague Conventions) when they wish the Serbs to return to these homes.
Compared to this horror, Mr Clayton's assertion that the ''core''
problem facing the people of Yugoslavia is whether the UK should have a
permanent seat on the Security Council of the UN is merely bizarre.
None the less I agree with him that the Croats should be made to
accept an internationally protected return of Krajina's inhabitants.
I stand absolutely behind the statement that the Bosnian Serbs are not
seeking a single foot of land primarily inhabited by any other group.
The Serbs are easily the largest ethnic group in Bosnia and if they
insisted on the ''first-past-the-post'' system which has made British
democracy what it is today, they could actually claim at least 70% of
Bosnia.
If they are the ogres so often portrayed on TV they are very moderate
ogres. Mr Speirs (August 11) does not actually dispute the truth of my
statement only the legitimacy of making it.
I still fail to understand the Government position that it was ethical
to pressure Croatia and the Bosnian Muslims to secede from Yugoslavia
and equally ethical to attack the Serbs for attempting to secede from
the claims of these new states.

PITHY pit-bull breeder Ford Keirnan and douce newspaper columnist John
Paul Leach: two different Glasgow blokes who talk the same brand of
high-grade mince. That's ''mince'' as in ''amusing and somewhat
nonsensical Glaswegian chit-chat,'' by the way. And not ''mince'' as in
''homosexual promenade.''
FK and JPL were oddly non-PC in making that clear to us right at the
start. Why? Dunno. Dunno why they haven't knitted more of their mince
into something, worked it into shape, too. Because when they do, as in
their subtitled TV news for Glasgow ne'er-do-wells and their updating of
Frank Sinatra, they're utterly side-splitting. As it is, FK and JPL talk
it like they walk it: gallus, VG.

FOR the Chessel Group's 17th Festival year six painters show in this
space -- pleasant once you battle through the weeds growing up the
unappetising approach to Moray House College.
With over 300 works, there's plenty to choose from. Too much perhaps.
But several pictures caught my eye: David Martin's familiar patterned
landscapes and a lively cut melon; Raeburn Murray's casual Majorca
Bakehouse; Avril Jaques's hedonistic sun bleached Rhodes Courtyard which
would light up any home. I also enjoyed her richly dramatic East Lothian
Cliffscape plus Sunlight and Shade with its chairs silhouetted under
trees. Attractive topography of Crail and Pittenweem harbours comes from
Graham Gurr -- always a popular subject.
Ken Southall's overpriced ceramics -- almost 100 pieces -- hog most of
the centre space. I'd avoid the horrid cats, (150) but I recommend his
blue and pink glazed Large Vase.

YESTERDAY was the first of the big Dvorak days of this year's festival
-- morning and evening. It was also a big day for understatement in
Dvorak. Maybe it's a national characteristic. Western conductors tend to
depict Dvorak as the red-blooded Bohemian, bristling with robust
melodies and snappy rhythms.
Just as the Panocha Quartet did earlier in the day, Czech conductor
Libor Pesek took another view last night. Across a wide span of works in
an extended concert -- another marathon, this one with two intervals --
Pesek took an infinitely more restrained view than conventional
interpretations.
From the outset of the enormously underrated Sixth Symphony, which
came at the end of a long concert, it was clear that Pesek was neither
going to rush nor push the music. The opening movement, which normally
takes off with such a swing, was mellow, broad, laid back, and calm. The
conventionally volcanic Scherzo had all the fire and drive you might
expect, but a much greater sense of control. Even the slow movement was
affected, with a pure warmth replacing the familiar, rather lush
sentiment. With the exception of some scratchy playing by the strings in
fiddly little runs, the RLPO played well under this direction.
The concert also included a rare opportunity to hear all three of
Dvorak's Nature, Life, and Love Overtures in the way the composer
originally intended -- together -- and, pastoral, exuberant, and
brooding, each informed the other.
Highlight of the night was the performance by Czech baritone, Peter
Mikulas, of the Biblical Songs, beautifully moving gems, gorgeously
orchestrated, and sung last night with genuine soul.

Fierce playing conditions yesterday for the Panocha String Quartet
from the Czech Republic, making the first of two contributions to the
Edinburgh Festival's survey of the music of Dvorak.
Jackets were off for their first half in the humid Queen's Hall, with
even the house lights reduced to try and prevent the build up of heat.
By the second half the group's ties were off and sleeves rolled up as,
drenched in sweat, they tried (and succeeded) not to slip off the
strings of their instruments.
Trying to pin down the playing style of the Panocha Quartet in three
of Dvorak's string quartets -- Nos 9, 10, and 12 (The American) -- is
like trying precisely to formulate the taste components of a subtle and
elusive wine. It is an acquired taste, whatever it is, and with a
definite hint of strain whenever the going gets tough.
The group is remarkably discreet and reserved: they have a small
sound, exaggerated by the fact that they play almost to themselves --
there is little hint of extrovert projection. Their sound -- unassertive
and rather dry -- has a delicate, wispy quality, though it's not
fragile.
To the Dvorak quartets -- especially The American -- all this brought
some remarkable insights, notably where, conventionally, you would
expect robustness and bloom. The Panochas, startlingly, conducted the
whole thing like a conspiratorial conversation. It takes time to get
used to, but is extremely engaging. More on Monday.

SELECTION five from the Greig-Duncan collection went back to the farm,
showing that, before soaps, people had plenty real-life dramas to watch.
Nothing so tabloid-preoccupying as Brookside's sub-patio body, perhaps,
but by no means were these neighbours necessarily good friends.
Peter Hall, Arthur Watson and Jock Duncan sang with few concessions to
a United Nations audience in the ScottishPower Gallery and captivated
them utterly.
Hall's Bogie's Bonnie Belle (seduction, unwanted pregnancy,
banishment) was only exceeded by his elbow, palm, and fist drummed mill
noises. Watson's Monymusk Lass (courtship thwarted by Ena Sharples-like
farmer's wife) was as firmly sung as it was sad.
But Duncan, a real character singing, twinkling eyed, in treacle-thick
Doric, stole the show with his ploughing song, complete with
enthusiastic and thorough actions which should ensure a good crop of
spuds on the gallery carpet later.

CECILIA Delatori is waiting for her date. She met Richard Gere at a
party in Muswell Hill where they kipped on the floor. Now they are
dining together in Cecilia's bedsit.
This is done with furious precision. Delatori has a range of accents
and caricatures with which she mercilessly parodies the pain and, er,
the pain of love and family.
Richard Gere is, in fact, one of those cartoon-style drawings they do
outside the museums in Rome. Cecilia's life is dominated by her Italian
descent -- from the Umbrian hills to a chip shop in Bristol. But her
story is smart and quick and funny.

ONE multi-purpose frock, yes. But the skilled and adaptable Geraldine
McNulty actually provides 12 distinct female characters as well as a
high reading on the smirk-and-titter quotient.
There is much to admire in McNulty's gallery of cameos. Her
platitudinous American country-folk singer; her mad Yorkshire hermit,
and her sex-starved farmer's wife. Best of all, though, is the sad and
lonely Betty Buchanan, who attains spiritual transfiguration through the
humiliation visited upon her by a bad haircut.
Now if Betty were to be given her own show for next year's Fringe . .

BY rights it shouldn't work. This is one of those two-man shows where
nothing happens more than the characters sitting and talking to each
other. Apart from an unexpectedly bloodthirsty finale, there is little
you could call dramatic action. The production even admits as much when,
in the closing gloom, we hear a list of radio-style credits read out.
But Tim Arthur's confidently acted play has a strange pull about it.
Built around a couple of ghost stories and elaborated with a long chain
of stories within stories, Dark Tales plays to the strengths of the oral
tradition -- our love of a good yarn -- and, helped along by moody
lighting and a load of keep-'em-guessing deconstruction, it somehow
holds our attention.
Like much genre fiction, it has little resonance beyond the moment.

SCOUSER Simon Bligh is an innocent and whole-hearted enthusiast. His
childhood dreams were of Japan, Zen and karate. Eventually, after
university and an abortive British stand-up career, he got there, only
to find that his life in the land of the rising sun was strangely
deflating.
Simon shares his autobiographical tale with amiable energy, sweating
like a Shinto warrior as he demonstrates how his pursuit of
self-knowledge pulled him round.
But do its moments of funniness make it comedy? Yes. And no. Is it
theatre? Kind of. Whatever it is, Simon's muscular, good-natured
discourse will at least teach you how to ask to go to the toilet in
Japanese. A Fringe first, methinks.

IT'S not that Morag Fullerton's revival of her 1986 Borderline hit
doesn't score some big laughs -- with Andy Gray heading the cast, how
could it not? When I saw it, it was still showing an unevenness that
will only be corrected through repeated performance.
Dario Fo is a tricky customer at the best of times and the
idiosyncracies of 1980s Italian politics don't transfer too comfortably.
But more than that, the production needs to be taken over by the manic
and anarchic edge felt only in the OTT scene-changes and Gray's pally
exchanges with the audience.

I AM not too sure about this business of having my mugshot at the top
of this diary; thesps with a grudge -- and there's quite a few out there
gunning for me by now -- will be able to assail me on the street with
whining complaints about my curt dismissals of their theatrical
pretensions, mistaking me for someone who gives a fig.
The great thing about the Fringe is that everyone and anyone is here.
The awful thing about the Fringe is that everyone and anyone is here.
Everywhere you go, parties, cafes, and supermarket queues, you're liable
to rub shoulders with someone whose show you reviewed the night before
-- which is fine and dandy if you liked their artistic offering and
damned awkward if you thought it was pants.
Standing on the steps at the Assembly Hall, offering a soundbite on
TAG's Lanark for Scottish Television -- ''no, you can't film me from the
bottom of the steps, you'll give me a double chin'' -- filming was
constantly stopped whenever members of the cast strolled past, obviously
out of concern for their fragile egos rather than any cowardice on my
part.
If push comes to shove I'm perfectly happy to nail my colours to the
mast, put my head on the block and defend my point of view, but I admit
I prefer doing so in print. I can't be bothered with all the
face-to-face combat which greets me at every Edinbugh bash -- all those
Greg Proops and Scott Capuro types whose party trick is confronting
critics. Bloody hell, I'm a journalist not a gladiator.
I was much taken by the ID passes of Liz Smith and Kate Campbell at
the Assembly Rooms; Kate's sporting a photo of Barbara Windsor and Liz
is Joan Rivers. Top idea, I reckoned. Those Who Know Better on the paper
didn't, vetoeing my suggestion of substituting my picture for a tasty
one of Sandra Bullock. I guess I'm just going to have to sit tight and
wait for my enemies to come over the hill, or The Mound, a-shooting. And
bite the bullet when they do.
* DESPITE being a lapsed Catholic, my prayer to St Anthony, patron
saint of lost things, obviously didn't fall on deaf ears. So far,
lighters and lipsticks aside, I haven't misplaced anything serious. I
did lose my voice, a total trauma for a confirmed chatterbox, but it
turned up yesterday.
Others have obviously been less attentive to the sainted Tony. Comic
Graham Norton had to make his first appearance without his hostess
trolley prop, which was more than a little inconvenient for a show
entitled Graham Norton and His Amazing Hostess Trolley. Apparently
no-one invoked the Trades Description Act for a refund.
C-Venue is thousands of pounds out of pocket after losing 20 lengths
of scaffolding from outside the building. Bright pink scaffolding mind
you, so it shouldn't be too difficult to spot. Hill Street Theatre has
lost an entire theatre company, Tmu-Na, from Israel who simply stayed in
Tel Aviv. The theatre only resigned themselves to this loss 10 minutes
before the curtain was due to go up, finally refunding tickets.
And the winningly named Chip Clark, part of the Californian
contingent, the Royal Stuart Scottish Performers Guild, lost his
appendix only 48 hours after arriving in Edinburgh. Now, that's just
careless, Chip.

ANTONIA Bird made her name at Edinburgh with her first film, Safe, a
powerful television drama about young people living on the streets in
London, which won the 1993 Chaplin prize for the Best New Director at
Edinburgh.
Last year she won the Michael Powell award for the Best British
Feature Film for her controversial tale of two Catholic priests facing
up to their different sexuality, one homosexual, one heterosexual, and
the demands of their faith. Third alas, proves unlucky.
Her American debut, Mad Love, shows few traces of the Bird style and
the last thing it will attract is controversy. She has fallen victim to
the system and the result is a fair to middling bland drive-in movie.
Hunky high school jock, Chris O'Donnell of the baby blue eyes, falls
head-over-heels for a psychiatrically disturbed classmate, Drew
Barrymore, she of the non-existent eyebrows and the perpetual lipsticked
pout. He abducts her from the psychiatric ward her parents have placed
her in and they go on the run.
The rest is bland, except for one disturbing scene in which Barrymore,
left alone by O'Donnell in a small town is overwhelmed by the sights and
sounds around. It suggests what the film, based on a Paula Milne script,
could have been like if Bird had been left to get on with it. O'Donnell,
for instance, is a Peeping Tom, an inherently nasty aspect of the
character which is never explored.
Chris Newby, who made the fascinating medieval tragedy, Anchoress,
strikingly filmed in black and white, has fared better with his second
film, Madagascar Skin. Made in colour, it is a homo-erotic fantasy
starring John Hannah as Harry, a young homosexual with a large purple
blemish on his face who can't get no satisfaction in London.
In despair he heads for Wales in his Deux Chevaux, ending up on a
lonely beach where he meets the equally disturbed kleptomaniac and
probable gangster, Flint (Bernard Hill).
Newby has been splendidly served by his photographer, Oliver Curtis,
and the film abounds in rich, erotic, maritime imagery. The odd couple
form a relationship, set up house in an abandoned cottage furnished with
goods Flint plunders from a nearby mansion whose owner is away.
Or is that body rotting in the bushes the owner? Did Flint kill him?
Lots of question, no answers. For once a BFI film that knows what it is
about.
* Mad Love. 11.30pm. Cameo 1. tonight; Madagascar Skin. 10.15pm.

AS the music thrashes out, light swirls across moving bodies in lycra
unitards -- red, purple, turquoise, lime . . . It's psychedelia
revisited, and an appropriate opening image for a performance
celebrating the life and music of Jimi Hendrix.
Hey Joe! -- presented by Leicestershire Youth Dance -- choreographs
classics like Angel, Voodoo Chile, Machine Gun, in a way that vividly
captures the spirit of Hendrix's music. Glimpses of the man himself come
in spoken footage while the age is conjured authentically in the
costumes.
Really demanding, energetic movement -- involving tricky catches,
lifts and balances -- flows confidently, effectively. Youth dance with a
dramatic, fiesty edge and a welcome degree of flair and technical
polish.

THE explosion of applause that greeted the end of Kerry Nixon's
performance of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto was more than justified.
Playing throughout with confidence, poise and a sweetness of tone right
up to those top notes, she never got lost among the strong support from
the Hillhead Strings, augmented with the necessary wind and brass
sections.
The precision here of orchestral playing was accompanied by delicacy
in Wilson's St Kentigern Suite, a convincing account acknowledged by the
composer generously coming forward from the audience to congratulate the
players.
The ensemble playing was particularly together when conductor Elaine
Fernandez swept the solo quartet and orchestra through a lyrical and
seamless Introduction and Allegro for strings by Elgar.
The Hillhead Strings can be well pleased with this appearance in the
Glasgow Festival of Youth Orchestras.

NOW that the world governments have failed in their duty to protect an
abused nation, it is up to the individuals and organisations to take up
the task of relieving the Bosnians of their sorrow.
Everyone is fully aware that if the governments really wanted to they
could have swept aside the inhumane Serbs with ease.
Iraq, which was much stronger than Serbia, was defeated by the unity
of the Western forces and the disunity of the Islamic forces. Now
America refuses to commit American ground troops in Bosnia in fear of
Americanising the Balkan war.
America did not bother about Americanising the Gulf war. Is it any
surprise that the Americans don't have any oil stakes in Bosnia?
Obviously the Western governments don't help the Bosnian Muslims
because they do not want to see another Muslim country within Europe.
The atrocities in Bosnia are a repeat of what happened centuries ago in
Muslim Spain when the Christians totally eliminated the Muslims from the
peninsula. Some time later these Christians ethnically cleansed most of
the New World of the natives.
The Muslims in Bosnia are not foreigners, they are pure-blooded, white
Europeans. They are not descended from the Turks, they have a right to
live in Europe not become refugees.
No Muslim country has ever treated the Christians in Asia and Africa
as the Christians have treated the Muslims. Even when the Christian
Crusaders invaded Jerusalem, they massacred every single Muslim and Jew
in the Holy City.
Now the world is watching the defenceless Bosnian Muslims suffering in
the hands of the Christian Croats and Serbs, who are receiving arms from
the Western powers.
Even the so-called Muslim countries are too involved in their own
affairs, or too scared of the West to intervene and fight alongside
their fellow Muslims.
The Bosnian Muslims now have either to defend themselves or be wiped
out from the face of the earth and cease to exist as a nation.

WITHIN hours of Highland region vetoing a plan to install condom
machines in the senior toilets of school and other civic centres, two
reports are published confirming that sex education is not a stimulus to
increased sexual behaviour among teenagers.
The two reports, one in the British Medical Journal, emphasised that
sex education in schools is gaining ground on gossip as the main source
of information for young people. This is surely a positive move, because
pupils can be, and are, encouraged to think of the wider issues relating
to sex, like the benefits of a long-term relationship, instead of just
the mechanics of where you put it.
The Herald reported that church leaders condemned a ''crazed condom
culture'' amid numerous fire-and-brimstone diatribes of collapsing
morality and sex breaking out in the classroom. The populist Highland
mood is that contraceptive provision and sex education are a force of
evil to be denounced and denied.
We should go back to the good old days when we all thought you could
prevent pregnancy by withdrawing in time or having sex standing up.
There may be young people sacrificing themselves on the altar of
ignorance, but it's all for the worthy cause of maintaining standards.
Doubtlessly, there are those who believe that Aids is part of a divine
strategy to rid the world of those degenerate youngsters having sex out
of wedlock in the first place. I am naive enough to believe that any
youngster's life (however sinful others deem it to be) is worth saving
from a slow, painful death due to contracting HIV and developing Aids.
Furthermore, I believe that preventing the birth of unwanted and
unloved children is a more constructive approach than obsolete rhetoric.
The Highland and Islands Health Board will probably continue to
investigate methods of reducing Scotland's highest teenage pregnancy
rate. Good on them. The main force behind that statistic, the archaic
attitudes of local leaders, is sadly outwith their remit.

IF we see a Labour Government after the General Election, I predict it
will quite soon after be announced that there will have to be a delay in
the establishment of a Scottish parliament.
Probably it will not after all be legislated for in the first year of
a Labour Government, nor likely even by the third year, but we will then
be told to hang on and expect a Scottish parliament within six years
(which will of course depend on the re-election of a Labour Government
at another General Election).
Are the Scottish people fools enough to trust Labour to deliver a
Scottish parliament? I am utterly convinced that devolution will not
happen unless the SNP can put pressure on Labour in power.

THE proposal by Robert Gordon University to develop an academic campus
on a conservation area at Garthdee on the outskirts of Aberdeen
indicates a lack of scruple which would be condemned as vandalism were
it to emanate from a private individual or commercial body.
While this alone should be enough to abort any further action on the
scheme, the concept seems to be seriously flawed in principle and
practice, suggesting that, were it to be realised, an irreplaceable part
of Aberdeen's birthright would be sold for a mess of pottage.
Although academic development in an urban environment may be fraught
with difficulties, it has been successfully achieved by many of the most
prestigious British and European universities with many advantages:
valuable social and commercial interaction of Town and Gown,
regeneration of the city centre by the replacement or rehabilitation of
obsolescent properties for educational and residential purposes, the
generation of demand for central accommodation as lodgings for students
during university terms, and the ability of students to walk to and
between their places of study and recreation rather than aggravating
traffic congestion by increased use of public or personal transport.
Even now there are several buildings in and around the site of the
original Robert Gordon's Technical College which have ceased to be used
for education purposes but which, with some architectural ingenuity
could continue in this role -- Marischal College and the old Central
School to name but two.
Surely more credit would accrue to RGU by breathing new life into
Aberdeen's centre than by puncturing one of its lungs at Garthdee?
Finally, surely some consideration must be given to the damage to the
amenity of the residents of Garthdee which would result from the
concentration of a massive building complex between them and the Dee,
with the daily comings and goings of 10,000 or more full and part-time
students and academic and supporting staff, and the addition of their
cars and service vehicles to the already intolerable traffic conditions
at the north end of the Bridge of Dee.

IT is a first for Scotland. It may also be a first for the BBC. The
fearless cutting edge of Queen Margaret Drive's drama department is
planning to dip in to the more colourful section of the English lexicon
and use the dreaded C-word in a television film.
And not just once. The word, possibly the most grossly offensive in
our language, is featured several times in Fridge, a powerful short film
by Glasgow actor, writer, and director Peter Mullan. It was unveiled at
Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival yesterday as part of BBC Scotland's
latest batch of three Tartan Shorts and will be screened early in the
new year.
BBC Scotland said the decision to allow the script to go ahead in its
uncompromisingly vituperative form was not taken lightly.
The language is so littered with varied expletives that the BBC, which
usually shows all three Tartan Shorts in one go, intends to break with
tradition and broadcast Mullan's film at a much later time of the
evening -- and with a strong warning for viewers.
Until now the use of the C-word, a term almost exclusively used by
men, has been virtually taboo in mainstream television. However, in
Glasgow's low-life circles, in which the film is set, it is little more
than a part of the vernacular.
The film comes at a time when there is growing concern about bad
language on television. The Government is reportedly preparing to clamp
down on the BBC by insisting that it adheres formally to certain
standards and does not offend taste and decency.
The C-word has been heard on television at least once before -- in the
feature film One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. According to the
Broadcasting Standards Council, the watchdog body which monitors matters
of taste and decency on television, a recent survey showed it to be the
word which viewers found most offensive.
The BSC declined to comment on Fridge yesterday because it had not
seen it. It generally acts on a programme only after it has been shown.
BBC Scotland's head of television, Mr Colin Cameron, and his head of
drama, Ms Andrea Calderwood, have both cleared the film for broadcast in
Scotland. It is also scheduled, along with its companion pieces, for a
slot on the BBC2 national network, providing the channel's controller,
Mr Michael Jackson, gives it the go-ahead. He has yet to see it.
Fridge, which was written and directed by Mullan, was welcomed
enthusiastically at yesterday's festival press screening. Shot in
black-and-white and filmed in a tenement court in Glasgow's Govanhill,
it is a tough drama about two homeless alcoholics and their attempt to
rescue a boy trapped in a discarded deep freeze. Though the language in
the film is particularly strong it does not come across as gratuitous.
Ms Calderwood said: ''We want our drama to reflect modern life and I
think the language for the story in Fridge is absolutely appropriate. It
is desperate language to reflect a desperate situation. However, I think
that we shall have to be very careful about when we show it and include
a warning to viewers about the language before it is shown.
''I don't want people to think that we just looked at the script and
said 'That's fine'. We had discussions (with Mullan and his producer,
Frances Higson) and asked if the strong language should be reduced. We
thought about it and decided to leave the characters and the language as
they were.''
The Tartan Short scheme, a joint initiative between the Scottish Film
Production Fund and BBC Scotland, was set up in 1992 as a way of
providing film-making opportunities for emerging Scottish talent. Three
projects each year are awarded #45,000 each to produce short dramas.

AS a merchant seaman employed on offshore supply vessels, I am
frequently sailing to and from Peterhead harbour.
At this time of year, as in other fishing ports around Scotland, the
Russian and Eastern European factory fishing vessels (or Klondikers as
they are known) are among us; swarming the harbour entrances, not daring
to berth for fear of recrimination by the Department of Transport's
Marine Safety Agency.
The herring are in our waters in abundance, the Klondikers want them,
and I believe pay good money for them.
There is, sadly, something else in abundance because of their
presence. Garbage! It is no coincidence that during the months these
vessels are anchored outside Peterhead I have observed from the bridge
of my vessel vast quantities of discarded oil and chemical drums, wooden
pallets, and general household refuse on the approaches to Peterhead.
One has only to determine the direction and strength with which the
tide is running to ascertain when one will encounter this debris.
Such debris is not only a pollutant and an eyesore, which will
inevitably ground itself on a beach somewhere, but is an immediate
navigational hazard to smaller craft.
There exist strict laws governing the disposal of garbage at sea which
are familiar to most if not all British seafarers.
The Klondikers anchored off Peterhead dump garbage into the water such
as plastics which may not, by law, be disposed of in any port of any sea
or ocean in the world.
I have some sympathy for those who work on such vessels (the living
conditions are sub-standard and the safety standards are appalling), but
as a seaman and a Scot I find my sympathy eroded by this flagrant
disregard for the law and the environment.

VETERAN entertainer Bruce Forsyth launched an attack on the BBC and
the forces of political correctness as he unveiled his new quiz show
yesterday.
Bruce's Price Is Right, produced by Yorkshire TV and Talbot
Television, comes shortly after the announcement that comedian Jim
Davidson is to take Forsyth's old role as frontman of the BBC's
Generation Game.
''They call the BBC Auntie but they should call it The Wicked Uncle,''
Forsyth said.
''I am very happy to have left there, no regrets at all. I will miss
my Generation Game team but nobody else in the building. They don't
understand my kind of showbusiness.''
A BBC spokesman said the outburst would not mark the end for Bruce's
chances of returning to the Beeb.
''Brucie has been to and fro between the BBC and ITV two or three
times in his career and I wouldn't rule out him coming back to the
Beeb.''
Forsyth's new show, which was previously hosted by Leslie Crowther,
features all the traditional game show elements of big prizes,
frantically cheering audiences, and curvy models in skimpy outfits.
However, alongside Kimberley Cowell, Emma Noble, and Emma Steadman is
male assistant Brian Tattersall, who Bruce revealed was taken on as a
concession to what he called the ''Loony Left''.
''We thought if we have four hostesses, all lovely girls, somebody is
going to complain. We have three lovely looking ladies and Brian, who is
a great looking guy, so I think we have catered for all sorts.''

THERE is nothing like a good old takover battle to get the market's
pulse racing, and a juicy #1700m offer for Fisons from French chemicals
giant Rhone Poulenc was just what was need to persuade an already
firming market to close at over 3500 on the FT-SE 100 index for the
first time since February last year.
The index did poke its nose above 3500 at the beginning of the month,
but then pulled back. Trading has been light in the past couple of days,
and a large all cash bid was enough to spur enthusiasm again, given the
prospect of much of the Fisons bid money being recycled back into the
market.
Helping the mood was a bid approach to Unipalm, which may be little
known but is that most fashionable of companies, an Internet provider.
Now dealers are confident that next week the old high of 3520.3 will be
surpassed, leaving the market in new territory at last.
Takeover rumours have circulated around Fisons at regular intervals,
and some analysts believe that now it is really in play, other predators
could be interested.
The bid is just the latest in a series of sometimes huge mergers
between world drug companies as they come to terms with budget-conscious
health authorities and escalating research and development costs.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR), an American pharmaceuticals company 68%
owned by its French parent, is offering 240p cash per Fisons share. But
the move was predictably rejected by the latter's chief executive Stuart
Wallis, who said the price seriously undervalued the shares.
RPR's managers have met Fisons on several occasions, but could not
persuade the company of the merits of their case. The two companies have
known each other for some time, having a joint marketing arrangement in
Europe, and also one in the US until recently.
A Fisons spokesman noted that RPR had been told three times in private
that its price was too low. It was now being told in public.
One of RPR's specialist areas is respiratory complaints, and Fisons'
attraction is its expertise in dealing with asthma -- particularly its
inhaler drug delivery system and, to a lesser extent, its Intal
anti-inflammatory drug for asthma sufferers.
Under Mr Willis, Fisons is fighting back after several years of
problems, and it is being re-shaped as a pharmaceutical marketing
company.
Its own research activities were sold off to Astra; scientific
instruments are about to go to a US buyer, and laboratory supplies are
up for sale.
The #500m realised was to be spent on building up a portfolio of drugs
developed by others, but marketed by Fisons' sales forces. Acquisitions
were also planned but the first target, Medeva, did not work out.
RPR says Fisons' assets have much better growth prospects within a
larger integrated drugs company. Fisons will give the American company a
more comprehensive respiratory and allergy product portfolio, a wider
geographic spread and Fisons' inhaler technology.
Intal is less important because its patent has expired and it is
exposed to heavy competition from cheaper look-alikes. But RPR hints
that the product could be tinkered with to make it sufficiently
different to be patentable again.
But the American company makes such a comprehensive demolition job of
Fisons' prospects in support of its offer that its own shareholders
might wonder why it wants to spend #1700m buying it.
RPR says Fisons is vulnerable because of patent expiry on Intal which,
with its related products Rynacrom and Opticrom account for 60% of
pharmaceutical sales. It has no replacement for Intal, and RPR doubts if
it can exploit its inhaler developments, while another product, Tilade,
has been disappointing.
RPR chief executive Michel de Rosen believes Fisons' strategy for
growth is misplaced because finding new products to market will not be
easy as there are limied opportunites in the respiratory field, while
acquisitions will be hard to find.
He adds insult to injury by suggesting that companies with products to
licence will not consider Fisons good enough.
However, analysts believe Fisons can put up a strong defence, pointing
to its overall expertise in the marketing of asthma products and the
size of the market, put at nearly #10bn worldwide, and increasing as
vehicle pollution gets worse. RPR would get hold of Fisons' experienced
sales force in a growing market.
Opinion on whether an auction will now develop for Fisons is divided.
Some consider RPR has already bid quite highly at some 24 times
prospective earnings, while others reckon companies like Schering or
Glaxo Wellcome could be interested.
If this fails to materialise, RPR will probably have to pay a little
more to get Fisons, but then it must have been budgeting for that, and a
price of nearer 270p should clinch it.

IT seems to me to be a pity if someone does not actually win the

much more sensible idea would be to send it to some carefully selected
people or causes.  My suggestion would be the Earl Haig Fund which is
not in any way supported by grants or allowances but which uses -- for
all its splendid homes, hospitals, and efforts -- money it has raised
from the public on its own.
We owe so much to these ex-Service men and women who protected us in a

WHEN the worm of political correctness has been beavering away within
a society for some time, common sense becomes a casualty. With the zeal
of the fanatic, with the pompous self-regard of the egotist, the
campaigners of political correctness kidnap issues and force the rest of
us to listen to their strident demands.
My deepest regret is that they have been so successful in so many
areas.
One of the most effective blackmail tactics of the PC Person is to
accuse someone of racism. If you believe like me that immigrant groups
whose first language is not English should be encouraged as a top
priority to learn it, and that providing large sections of library books
in Urdu and printing DSS leaflets in Punjabi is hindering rather than
helping this process, then you run the risk of being called racist.
This false accusation does not trouble me personally but it has
intimidated many decent people into keeping quiet when they wanted to
speak out and bring some common sense to the discussion of social
issues.
I am a great believer in common sense as a solution to all problems
great and small and even to the biggest moral dilemmas which face us.
Common sense tells us that it serves no higher plan to keep brain-dead
patients alive. However, fear of litigation and accusation have made
doctors less willing to sanction the cessation of treatment.
Now, as in the case at Law Hospital this week, the relatives of
brain-dead patients are being forced to resort to courts of law to
settle such matters. Another victory for complicated doctrine over
common decency.
The welfare state stretches from cradle to grave, but political
correctness reaches back even before the cradle, into the womb itself.
Common sense tells me that a deformed foetus is best not born or that an
unwanted baby is best not conceived, but try telling that to those who
have styled themselves ''Pro-life''.
Those of us who prefer quality to quantity when it comes to issues of
life and death have been made to look as if we are ''anti-life'' when we
take a more commonsense approach to birth ethics.
For a perfect illustration of that we need look only at the reactions
this week to the attempt by John Redwood to bring a bit of common sense
to the topic of under-age single parents. Mr Redwood is not my type of
Tory, a touch too tinder dry on the economic front for me, but in this
instance he was being far from doctrinaire.
He advocated adoption for babies whose mothers were legally (to say
nothing of psychologically) too young to look after them. His point, as
I understand it, was that it made better sense for the babies of
under-age mothers to be adopted. The mothers would be saved from failing
at a task for which they were ill-equipped. The state would be saved the
cost of providing benefits for the family; and the adopting parents
would be glad to have a baby.
The reaction was predictable. Redwood was seen as taking a big stick
to these innocent girls (an appropriate metaphor in view of his name)
and starving them of the carrot puree with which to feed their
offspring. How dare he! Yet if we stop and think about the issues which
he raised, we will see that he was talking common sense.
Suppose someone decides they want a baby. Yet they live in a house in
which there is one wage earner whose wage supports the whole family. Is
it legitimate to ask the wage earner whether he or she objects to having
another mouth to feed?
What is so different about a society in which thousands of babies are
fed from the taxes which wage earners up and down the land have paid? Do
these people who provide at second hand for the children born in their
society not have a say in the process at all? I believe that they should
to the extent of being able to exert some kind of influence at second
hand.
Of course common sense is not enough to create a civilised society. We
need compassion even more. The problem is that in the case of under-age
and unwed mothers we are asked to show compassion at a distance without
being allowed to link it to common sense.
That is a recipe for souring the milk of human kindness and we all
know what effect sour milk has on babies who are fed this as a diet.
Redwood was right to raise the problem. Perhaps his solution is not
the perfect one, but if those who take his commonsense approach are to
be howled down, we run the risk of even greater polarisation within our
society than exists at present. At the moment, it is regarded as
patronising and inhumane to hand out social security with strings
attached. In many cases I believe it is common sense to do so.
People who smoke and drink large quantities and exist on benefit,
would be better off with food vouchers. People who have no means of
supporting the children they already have should not be given more money
to have another one. It's only common sense.
I'll go further. It is compassionate because it identifies with social
problems and tries to improve them. We are our brother's keeper in the
modern welfare state in two senses. One, we pay to sustain it. Two, we
have a moral duty to influence the way in which it is used. Those who
try to deny the rest of us the opportunity to apply common sense in
doing so, are not so much politically correct as morally wrong.

SALES of Irn Bru and other AG Barr soft drinks are 50% up on this time
last year as a result of the summer heatwave.
Sales are running at record levels and the bottling plants of the
Glasgow-based company can't keep pace with rising demand.
But chairman Robin Barr warned that a sharp rise in packaging and
sugar costs would reduce the sweetness of bumper sales on the full-year
results.
''What could have been a glorious summer leading to glorious results
has been mauled by packaging costs, which are enormously up on 12 months
ago,'' he said.
Booming sales will also slump dramatically when the two-month-old
heatwave finally comes to an end.
''The difference between a week of sunshine and a week of cloud,
misery, rain and wind can be 50%, 60% or 70% in sales,'' Mr Barr said.
''I don't know whether the heatwave is going to go on for another
three weeks yet. If it does, that would make an enormous difference,''
he added, noting that the scorching summer of 1976 lasted until
mid-September.
Soft drink sales are notoriously dependent on the weather, and Mr Barr
said only a fool would predict the final outcome of his company's
current financial year, which ends in October.
But he admitted sales were running at record levels, and well ahead of
expectations.
As usual at this time of year, Barr is operating some bottling lines
round the clock, but output has been squeezed by a shortage of cans and
plastic PET bottles.
As a result, Barr's stocks of soft drinks have fallen below two weeks'
supply at the current rate of consumption, but the company has not yet
been forced to short-deliver its customers.
Mr Barr said last week's sales were 50% up on the same period last
year, boosted by the company's acquisition of the Orangina bottling
franchise in March, as well as the heatwave.
Like-for-like sales were about 35% ahead, outpacing a 30% increase
announced by Coca Cola.
Barr's main products are Irn Bru, ''Scotland's other national drink'',
Tizer, which is better known to English consumers, and Orangina.
This fizzy orange drink has been doing well since Barr took over the
franchise from Bulmer six months ago. Mr Barr said Orangina sales were
now running neck-and-neck with Tizer.
Barr claims about a quarter of the Scottish carbonated drinks market
-- the same as Coca Cola -- and 6% of the overall UK market.
But its results for the six months to April were hit by sharp rises in
packaging and sugar costs. Pre-tax profits slipped to #1.8m from #2.3m,
despite a slight increase in turnover to #41.4m.
Mr Barr said these price hikes, which ranged from 10% for sugar to 50%
for PET plastic bottles -- appeared to have peaked.
But he pointed out that the company had not passed on these additional
costs to the consumer. Its annual round of price rises in the spring
were kept in line with the general inflation rate of 3.5%.
''Our margins were squeezed and in a normal summer that squeeze would
have been extremely injurious,'' Mr Barr said.
Nevertheless, Barr shares and those of other soft drink producers did
exceptionally well this week following Coca Cola's announcement that UK
sales had achieved record levels.
Barr shares rose 6p to 364p yesterday, after adding 10p on Thursday.
* SCOTTISHPOWER reports a rush to buy fridges and fans as Scotland
wilts in its hottest summer for 19 years.
But surprisingly perhaps, there has been no drop in demand for
heaters.
A ScottishPower spokesman said sales of fridges and freezers at the
company's chain of electrical retail stores were 40% to 50% up on last
summer, and demand for fans had nearly trebled.
The spokesman said sales remained steady. ''There is no discernible
slowdown in the sale of heaters, but this is not a great time for buying
heaters anyway,'' he added.

THE United States is rattling its sabre in a good cause but in the
usual ham-fisted manner. The good cause is the continuing effort to rid
Iraq and the world of Saddam Hussein. This would be to the benefit of
many people, quite apart from the relief that it would bring to the
citizens of Iraq who have been suffering the attentions of this despot
for too long. As the Mercedes-powered caravan of defectors from the
Iraqi leadership has confirmed, the top people in Iraq are immune from
the sufferings of the ordinary people. Those sufferings are very great
and their effect is almost entirely due to United Nations sanctions.
It is clear that the departure of General Hussein Kamel and others has
weakened the Iraqi leader's position. The question is, how much, and in
what manner can the effect be heightened? The Americans suspect that
they have the answer but they are only partly correct. Thus far their
strategy appears to be a concentration of military and economic pressure
on the Iraqi regime with the hope that either or both will weaken Saddam
further, thus allowing a successful uprising.  Economic pressure is
working and will continue to do so: we will return to that in a moment.
Military pressure is always a favourite, partly because it is dramatic
and gives a feeling of doing something positive. Thus we have American
tanks and trucks manoeuvring pointlessly south of Amman. This military
exercise was planned for some time but it has been enhanced as a result
of the current situation in Iraq. Washington's arguments for this are
weak, however. US intelligence claims to have detected suspicious Iraqi
troop movements directed at Kuwait. This is, to say the least, unlikely.
Nor is the propaganda effort heightened by a bald statement from UN
observers on the Iraq-Kuwait border who say they have detected no such
Iraqi troop movements in Southern Iraq.
The fact is that putting military pressure on Saddam is generally
counter-productive, merely strengthening his grip on his own forces.
Economic action is much more effective and American attempts to persuade
Jordan to cut economic ties with Iraq (bolstered by the re-supply of
Saudi oil to Jordan) will bear most fruit.

MR BLAIR has set such a hectic pace in transforming Labour and
enhancing its electoral prospects that it would be surprising if there
were no doubts about his leadership. These were given a farcical
dimension, worthy of Evelyn Waugh, in the confusion which led London's
evening paper to publish some knocking copy, purporting to be by Mr
Bryan Gould, a former contender for the Labour leadership, but in fact
by the son of a Tory Cabinet Minister. Other critics have enjoyed more
credibility but little weight. Lady Castle who weighed in yesterday has
both but her remarks were balanced -- her doubts about Mr Blair's
ideological stance were accompanied by praise for the evident relish
with which he has set about his main job of displacing the Government.
None of this is new in Labour history. The party has always had doubts
about its leaders since Ramsay Macdonald appeared to let it down so
abruptly in 1930. (It is only recently that Labour historians have been
able to offer more sympathetic accounts of Macdonald's motives and
role.) Even Attlee, who delivered spectacular electoral success in 1945,
encountered systematic internal opposition from 1947. Gaitskell, a
divisive figure anyhow, was never without it, and Wilson, his own
electoral achievements notwithstanding, suffered much fraternal sniping.
In a way which became indisputable in the 1970s and eighties it was a
Labour habit to divert its energies into self-destructive analysis whose
only beneficiaries were the Conservatives.   That is hardly likely to
recur, but the warning is worth making. It is not to Mr Blair's
discredit that he appeals in regions and to groups which previously may
not have supported Labour. It is a measure of his success, of his
transcending the idea that Labour is a party confined by class or
geography: it has always tried to be a party of all classes, of all
areas. Mr Blair is making that claim, that hope, more effective than
ever before. Tories are right to fear him, just as they are right to
enjoy these latest  attacks of his ''candid friends''.

BUT for the impending sale of the direct stake in BSkyB, which will
raise perhaps #500m, Pearson shareholders can look back on the first six
months with little pleasure.
To be sure, it was a period of considerable change, which will result
in the media and entertainments group moving much further into
television and its derivatives, even if there is the suspicion that it
has been paying over the odds for some acquisitions.
Half-time profits plunged 27% to #50.5m because of a combination of
substantial net asset write-downs, redundancy costs and poor trading
among most subsidiaries, offset partially by increased income from
BSkyB.
Chairman Lord Blakenham definitively ruled out a bid for The Scotsman.
He added that the Westminster Press subsidiary, which is subject to
''constant strategy reviews'', is only interested in acquiring papers
adjacent to its existing operations, and that he is not interested in
buying the Reed newspaper activities.
Westminster is regarded as very much a cash cow to fund expansion
elsewhere in the group, although its profits in the first half were hit
by #5.2m of redundancy costs.
Its advertising revenue rose 15%, but it was struck by higher paper
costs, which altogether seem likely to add more than #20m to the Pearson
group's overall bill of just in excess of #100m.
The Financial Times operation said the masthead paper's profits drop
was caused by redundancy costs connected with the closure of its East
India Dock printing works and weaker advertising in the second quarter.
But overall divisional profitability was helped by the consolidation of
the Recoletos newspaper activities in Spain.
Pearson is pushing hard into financial information services, even if
that area does seem to be approaching saturation. The Pearson
Professional subsidiary, which has an arm specialising in Japanese
pharmaceuticals, was hard hit by the Kobe earthquake -- the city being
the industry centre.
Education saw the Addison-Wesley school book operation in the US under
intense margin pressure, and there seems little prospect of it reaching
its 1994 full-year figure.
Penguin had a slow start, with accompanying redundancies, but in
recent weeks its 60th-birthday promotion selling books at 60p has
resulted in sales of 13 million.
The BSkyB sale decision is based on Pearson not having any large
management role, and it will achieve a very substantial profit. The
total investment was #130m and already it is showing a #30m net gain on
that, with perhaps another #500m to come.
It will retain an indirect 4.3% holding worth #220m to produce one of
the best corporate gains seen for many years, totalling about #750m.

WITHOUT wishing to tempt fate it does look likely that the Scottish
international football team will play in the finals of the European
Championships in England next year. This will not bring unalloyed
happiness as Scottish citizens will undoubtedly be subjected to the
rollercoaster of emotions made familiar by previous contests, not to
mention family disputes and headaches. It will be even less of a happy
occasion if the football authorities in charge of planning do not
improve on their first thoughts for ticket allocations. As a foreign
team (foreign to England, that is) the followers of the Scottish team
will be allocated 7000 tickets for each game.
There is no particular problem in being classed as foreigners. Quite
apart from any nationalistic points which could be made, it is
Scotland's definition as being a separate national team to England,
Wales, and Northern Ireland which allows us to compete as a nation in
international competitions. Unfortunately, as in most simple application
of rules, the granting of only 7000 tickets to Scots fans for each match
is likely to be dangerously inadequate.   The reasons for this are
simple. The obvious proximity of Scotland to England makes likely that
many more than 7000 Scots fans will want tickets for the games and all
will be within easy reach of the chosen grounds. This will be
particularly relevant if Scotland's early matches are played in the
north of England. If more than 18,000 Scots fans travelled to Italy for
the World Cup in 1990 it is probable that more will want to view the
European Championships just a few miles down the motorway. This could
lead to unhappy mobs of ticketless fans travelling in hope but almost
certainly sure of disappointment. The whole point of allocating a
controlled number of tickets is that the relevant seats will be
segregated from other fans thus minimising the possibility of trouble.
But many fans denied one of the 7000 tickets will probably ensure that
friends and relatives in England buy them tickets. Therefore there could
be numbers of Scots mixed up with groups of other fans, thereby
rendering the security precations useless. A simple grasp of these
realities demands a bigger allocation of tickets. This would not be
favouritism, but common sense.

THE provision of sports pitches and playing fields should, in future,
include policies for stopping their unnecessary development and to
protect the environment, with the Scottish Sports Council fully
involved, it was said yesterday.
The Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth, released
guidelines aimed at ensuring the provision of a full range of sport and
recreational facilities in Scotland.
It follows the announcement last month of a #300,000 package aimed at
bringing competitive sport back to Scottish schools and the latest
initiative was welcomed generally yesterday.
The provisions are included in a draft national policy guideline
document which hopes to ensure proper sport and recreation facilities
without damaging the environment.
Mr Forsyth explained: ''From team games to going for a stroll, playing
fields and sports pitches provide valuable amenities across Scotland.''
The Minister felt the guidelines should include the Scottish Sports
Council on consultation and that local policies should be taken into
consideration.
He added: ''I am keen to encourage more people to take part in sport
and see local communities benefiting from improved facilities.''
This point was welcomed later by the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities. A Cosla spokeswoman said: ''While we have not studied the
proposals in detail, we are in favour of the role local authorities
could play, and look forward to working with the Scottish Sports
Council.''
Mr Ivor Davies, director of planning at the Scottish Sports Council,
felt the new plan complemented the first initiativeand hoped there may
be national lottery money available to finance new projects.
He said: ''Meantime, we have about 5000 pitches across the range of
sport in Scotland and several hundred more are needed by the year
2000.''
However, Mr Ronald Smith of the Educational Institute of Scotland
warned: ''While it is a welcome 'first', there is the question of money
being made available for the plans.''

I AM pleased to note that Alex Salmond and others are at last
beginning to discover Irish summer schools. I believe, though, that the
Humbert School in Ballina, Co Mayo, organised by a Scot, John Cooney,
The Herald's Ireland correspondent, is better known than the Yeats
School at Sligo (August 19).
I'm delighted that the SNP leader sees Irish summer schools as
something Scots can learn from -- and perhaps copy. However, I have been
trying to get a Loch Lomond Summer School off the ground for some years
now, but here we appear to major in mediocrity.
I suggested a series of lectures and discussions -- the John Logie
Baird Memorial Lecture on television and technology; the Tobias Smollett
on writing; the Henry Bell on engineering; the Charles Rennie Mackintosh
on architecture and design, the Alex Jackson (Wembley Wizard) on sport
and so on. All have Loch Lomond connections.
I suggested live music and poetry recitals in the pubs and live
theatre in village, town, and church halls, and all at a time when large
numbers of visitors would be attracted to the area by the Highland
Gatherings at Balloch, Luss, and Rosneath.
My plan, properly presented and professionally costed, has been doing
the rounds of the appropriate agencies for favour of grant aid and
support since October 1992, but no-one quite knows what to make of it.
Perhaps they do now that they've read Alex Salmond's excellent and
informative article.

Alison Daniels discovers how forensic experts are helping in
the battle against war crimes
FROM the barrage of news of fighting in the former Yugoslavia and the
unimaginable misery experienced by thousands of fleeing refugees, have
filtered in recent weeks more dark reports of torture and mass
executions.
Ten days ago an American aircraft flew over a freshly dug field in
eastern Bosnia near the former safe haven of Srebrenica. Aerial
photographs seems to indicate it is a mass unmarked grave. Humanitarian
organisations estimate that up to 2700 people may have been taken from
their homes, shot and disposed off in the mud by separatist Serbs.
Such examples throw into sharp relief the enormity of the task facing
human rights investigators worldwide, attempting to identify the victims
of atrocities stretching back decades.
Next week in Glasgow a group of forensic scientists from around the
world will meet to discuss with representatives from humanitarian
organisation ways in which international procedures can be clarified and
how to remove the obstacles to bringing the perpetrators of war crimes
to justice.
Co-ordinating the meeting, which comes at the end of a unique
month-long course on forensic techniques, Glasgow University's professor
of forensic medicine, Peter Vanezis, says war-crime investigations have
in the past decade become a worldwide endeavour, sometimes co-ordinated
by the UN, sometimes undertaken by new democratic regimes anxious to
exorcise the past.
Scientific methods of piecing together the identity of a murdered
individual are still largely those used to identify the corpses of the
Nazi concentration camps.
Matching records with skeletal remains can yield details of sex,
height, diseases, accidents and pregnancies. Such techniques are
relatively inexpensive, requiring principally that bones are carefully
removed. In countries with poor or non-existent medical and dental
records the identification of victims is a crude process of matching
clothing.
However, developments in computer-generated facial reconstruction and
the DNA testing of remains then matched to blood samples taken from
living relatives of victims have meant previously impossible cases can
at last be solved.
Already replicas of skulls exhumed from clandestine graves in Latin
America are sent to Glasgow University for identification. This October
the university hopes to set up a centre for human remains
identification, pulling together advances made in Western laboratories
as well as providing assistance and training in countries with fledgling
forensic institutes.
The key to identification relies on graves being accurately pinpointed
and excavated using delicate archaeological tools. Lack of expertise has
seen exhumations carried out with bulldozers, crushing bones and mixing
up skeletons.
Oscar Mendoza, a researcher with the Glasgow-based charity Scottish
Catholic International Aid Fund, which supports a number of
organisations investigating human rights abuses in Chile and Guatemala,
says funding is another key problem.
While the Chilean democratic government has, since 1991, sanctioned
and funded investigations into thousands of disappearances as well as
paying out compensation, in Guatemala, where about 150,000 people are
thought to have been massacred and disposed of in unmarked graves in the
early 1980s, investigations remain risky and dependent on charity
funding.
A Chilean held as a political prisoner for two years, Mendoza was
forced into exile in 1975. Many close friends are among the country's
litany of the disappeared. Speaking from experience, he says it is vital
emotionally for relatives and friends that a victim's body is identified
and returned for burial.
''Science can contribute by investigating these crimes, by training
health workers and others on the ground, but most importantly by
mobilising the international community so that these crimes stop
happening.''

A STRONG set of money supply figures, suggesting that activity may be
picking up, was in marked contrast to gloomy lending data from the
Building Societies Association, writes R E DUNDAS.
M4 lending by the banks and building societies to the private sector
rose by #6900m in July, sharply higher than June's #1700m, and broad M4
rose by 1%, taking the annual rate of increase up from 6.7% to 8%.
Figures earlier in the year were distorted by Glaxo's takeover of
Wellcome, and the latest set of data were boosted by special factors. M4
and M4 lending were boosted by #1800m as a result of Lloyds Bank taking
over the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society.
A further #1200m was added as a result of building societies acquiring
mortgage books previously financed abroad.
Stripping out the special factors, M4 lending was robust. Figures from
the British Bankers' Association showed that lending to indiiduals was
sharply higher at #709m. There was also a recovery in lending to
manufacturing industry, which amounted to #45m in July, compared with a
repayment of #285m in June.

WHEN children die newspapers print family snapshots of them. These are
unbearably poignant. Children in proud moments, at their cutest, in
happy times.
When Alison Hargreaves was photographed with her children after her
solo ascent of Everest, in the short gap before she set off to tackle
K2, the pictures were, for me, even more unbearably poignant. The
trusting hands in hers, the pleasure in shining upturned faces.
I should come clean and admit now that my children are of the same
ages as her's, that is seven and four.
There were, I found, two distinct responses from women to her
achievement: ''Oh, I wish I could do something as exciting, as brave, as
that,'' a childless friend sighed. It pulled me up hard. I'd been
thinking the reverse: Why? How could she risk her children's happiness?
And for what?
I think what was troubling for me was that the happy images confronted
us with a maternal ambivalence. Here was I, a working mother, catching
myself in the uncomfortable act of wondering about the motives of a
woman I couldn't begin to understand. We're talking here of someone who
takes a handbag up the hills in the hope of finding a cafe over the
brow.
But here was a woman who wanted to accept danger, endure privation,
and seek the ultimate thrill of walking on the edge.
There was in the early years of the women's movement a lot of vexed
discussion about the de-mystification of the joys of self-sacrificing
motherhood. Then this debate was eroded. It was partly feminism's own
fault. They never talked of the deep satisfactions which mothering can
bring. But it was also that the eighties backlash labelled women who
wanted a fairer deal, and -- oh, scandal -- some measure of equal
treatment as human beings, as whingeing, selfish careerists.
Then a reaction set in to that. Motherhood was romanticised again. But
it was reduced to photo opportunities of glamorous, successful mothers
havering on about how meaningful motherhood is. How motherhood meant
having small, attractive human accessories while staying unchanged. It
was all made to look so easy, as if there is nothing involved -- no
work, no depth, no ambivalent feeling. Anyone who dares squeak-up and
say mothering is hard and stressful feels inadequate and a dud.
The difficulty is when reality sets in with the children. When you
become a mother you find that -- though the feminist gurus may have been
wrong to present motherhood as all hell, and the eighties pretence that
you can have it all, jobs, children and boobs that don't sag is the
mirror myth -- the truth is that it does demand changes in your life.
That it unleashes feelings that can drive you crazy. Sometimes it
provokes a tension between what your child needs and deserves and what
you want which can feel insoluble.
It goes without saying that the same questions wouldn't arise if
Alison Hargreaves was a man. That is not the point. The compulsion to
climb a mountain must be so strong, so powerful, that it can overwhelm
that incredibly fierce instinct to protect your children from hurt.
Alison Hargreaves and her husband knew the risks she was taking, not
only with her own life but with her children's future. ''I had luck on
Everest but the law of averages says that I should not get such a good
break on K2,'' she said.
It was hard to know whether to admire the stoic response of her
husband or to burst into tears of incredulity. Here is a man who has
lost his wife and the mother of his two small children calmly
acknowledging that she had reached the summit of her life and the peak
of her ambition somewhere in a blizzard, faraway, on K2.
We heard the news that she was lost amidst mountains soaring
gloriously into a cobalt sky. Some mountaineers have, I know, described
the spiritual element that leads them to climb those heights. For others
it's just because they are there. Because I have no wish to dominate
those mountains doesn't mean I can't wonder at those who dare. I hope
Alison's children believe she is a hero.
I can rationalise her achievement but, in truth, I still don't really
understand it.

PETER SELLARS believes he has seen the future in Britain. And he urges
anyone who will listen to try to change the script. The American theatre
director, who has garnered a worldwide reputation for operatic
productions interwoven with political and social concerns, has been in
Edinburgh over the past week with his new work I Was Looking At The
Ceiling And Then I Saw The Sky, a piece examining the lives and troubled
times of seven young Californians at the time of the Los Angeles
earthquake.
Moving as he does between Europe and America's West Coast, his fears
are that Britain is now regularly importing American policies which have
not just consistently failed, but resulted in a truly terrifying level
of casual violence.
''In Los Angeles last year 900 young people were shot. Now that is a
carnage of Bosnian proportions. And it happens because people are put
under intolerable levels of stress and eventually some of them just
explode. They load up their gun, walk into McDonald's and shoot
strangers. We have created a society which breeds violence. A society
where the rich have got four times wealthier than before and the poor,
if they can find work, are having to do two and three jobs to survive.
''Typically they will be people taken on after the original workforce
has been fired, and the rehires will be given no rights and a lower
level of pay and will be too vulnerable to do anything but accept the
conditions offered.''
That is a pattern he watches emerging in this country, despite the
fact that America is hardly a current role-model for economic success.
''They talk about efficiency, you know. I distrust that word. It very
rarely means thinking and planning long term. Just as I wonder why our
politicians say we have to conduct ourselves more as a business. What
has business done that's so enviable in the past decade? Whole sections
of it have gone down the tubes.''
In California, he tells you, they are now building $13bn worth of new
prisons at the same time as closing down 37 medical centres and cutting
school meals.
Meanwhile, he says, the new jail cells are finding a new class of
customers; the homeless and dispossessed.
''Now what kind of country, what kind of civilisation puts people in
jail when they need jobs? It's not as if it even makes sense bottom-line
as an economic measure. It costs $40,000 to keep people in prison.''
All of which, Sellars contends, is happening against a backdrop where
dissent is being stifled, legislation passed without either advance
notice or serious challenge, and politicians on the Democratic side
appear to have had a vertebrae by-pass.
''Look at the situation on the information superhighways, for
instance. All of them coming under the control of a small number of
people who will pursue their own agenda and disenfranchise whole
communities. There will be no restrictions put on their activities. The
only restriction is censorship of opposition.''
''Look at our three major network channels now, all owned by major
business corporations. How much freedom of information can we expect
from that scenario? Even the few independent newspapers are now
reluctant to publish adverse comment.
''The Washington Post, for example, has just killed a key
investigation which proved that our lengthy and expensive drugs policy
has been an abject failure. Meanwhile our politicians wake up in the
morning and check the opinion polls to see what they think. Nobody seems
to have the courage to set the agenda.
''As Martin Luther King said, what we need are politicians who are
thermostats rather than thermometers; setting the temperature not just
taking it.''
Hostile legislation is now rarely flagged up more than two days in
advance, he claims. So there is no time to grasp the significance and
certainly no time to mobilise public opinion and opposition.
''What we get in our press now is coverage of laws passed yesterday.
It's like Berlin in 1933. And in whose name? The Republicans currently
have 54% of a poll where only 30% of Americans cared enough to vote any
more. That's 17% of American citizens.''
When he assembles those anxieties about the democratic process
back-to-back he becomes inordinately depressed. But he seeks comfort
from historical parallels, reminding you that a Hoover administration
which turned the guns of the National Guard on the homeless was followed
by a Roosevelt one which sought national renewal through a huge
programme of investment in public services, providing not just thousands
of desperately needed jobs but some of the finest buildings ever
produced.
''I don't know how much worse things have to become before people
demand that we once again invest in our country in that way. And in its
people. Native Americans have a saying that you should do nothing which
would harm your children down to the seventh generation. And we have to
find the courage to follow that philosophy. The real point of the Good
Samaritan parable for me is that he gave of himself.
''He didn't get someone else to fix it for him. And maybe the answer
for us will be in communities once again looking out for themselves and
for each other. Realising that helping the homeless is a two-way process
from which you both gain.''
Not the kind of sentiments easily interchangeable with current
politicalspeak in America -- or indeed here -- but proof, if it were
needed, that Sellars is not just a fine director but a seriously decent
human being who believes that his work should help give a voice to those
with no other means of communicating their pain.
He tells you an anecdote from his own neighbourhood. An out-of-work
white actor shoots dead two young Mexicans. He says he shot them because
they were Mexican skinheads out to kill him. He becomes a hero of the
day. And nobody bothers too much about the fact that the teenagers were
shot in the back.
''It is incidents like that which made me want to make my new opera
for young people and about them. It hasn't had a good reception from
many middle-aged white critics in America. But that doesn't matter at
all. We were talking over their heads to people of 17 and 20. They are
the future.''

Professor E M McGirr reflects that despite modern scientific methods
and philosophies, man is still baffled by the ultimate mystery on earth
-- the origin of life
MAN, in his diverse cultures, has always been preoccupied with
questions about ''life''. Early in his existence he identified the life
force (vis vitae) with an immaterial principle, ''vital spirit''. The
concept was shared by people of different races and traditions and there
was an equivalent terminology for it in their various languages: quod
semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus (always, everywhere and by all).
Today, man is much better informed about the physical phenomena that
are fundamental to, signify, and characterise the living state than his
predecessors were. But he is as baffled as they were about the origin of
''life'' and the identity of its essence, the principle that animates
mortal flesh.
The belief in its supernatural origin had a far-reaching influence on
philosophical thinking and also on medical theory and ethics. The
Greeks, starting in the fifth century BC with Empedocles and continuing
with Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle and Galen, expounded and elaborated
various ideas.
They postulated that human life (''vital spirit'') derived from
''universal spirit'' (divine life) which entered the body in the act of
breathing. Within the body ''natural spirit'' was refined to ''vital
spirit'' in the heart (the seat of the ''intellect'', symbolically
speaking) and to ''animal spirit'' in the brain (the seat of the psyche
or soul). ''Animal spirit'' (anima or soul) animated the body.
In their perception, man comprised the ternary, spirit, soul and body
in descending levels of reality. The spirit linked man with the divine.
The immortal soul preceded and survived the individual's earthy
existence. Its ''rational'' element, special to man, resided in the
brain. (In contrast to man, animals had a ''sensitive'' but not a
''rational'' soul, while plants merely had a ''nutritive'' and
''reproductive'' soul).
The soul governed the body and kept it healthy by maintaining a
harmonious balance between its four humours (black bile, yellow bile,
blood, and phlegm). The humours, which pertained more to the psychic
than physical realm, were directly related to the four temperaments
(melancholic, choleric, sanguine, and phlegmatic) and to the four
elements (earth, fire, air, and water) from which the body, like all
material matter, was formed. Disease arose when the body and soul were
in conflict and the equilibrium between the humours was disrupted.
The ideas and teachings of the Greeks were assimilated into the
monotheistic religions, Jewish, Christian, and Moslem alike. The
Judaeo-Christian view of man's creation is graphically and figuratively
expressed in Genesis chapter 2, verse 7:
''And the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life: and many became a living being.''
Man's earthly body was animated by the breath of God.
The cosmology of the Greeks was largely shared by the early Christian
writers as well as by later scholastic philosophers. The Arabists,
influenced in their attitude to medicine by the words of the Prophet,
(for example, ''O servant of God, use medicine'' became ''God hath not
created a pain without a remedy for it''), were particularly
well-disposed to it.
Theirs became the predominant influence on its development. They
adopted and adapted the Greek systems of physiology and medicine and, as
a result, the teachings of the Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen
prevailed more or less uninterruptedly until the end of the Middle Ages
and beyond.
With the revolution in thought that began in the fifteenth-century
Renaissance and culminated in the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, the
classical and medieval ''otherwise'' of God and man were progressively
replaced by the empirical thinking of the new humanism with its emphasis
on materialism. The concept of spirit of ''intellect'' was ''degraded''
and the term ''intellectual'' became synonymous with ''mental'' or
''rational''.
Philosophy was seen as the product of the human mind rather than
divine revelation or inspired intuition. Science was the mainspring
between thought and action. Traditionalists regarded the changes in
attitudes as a progressive loss of Platonic vision whereas humanists
regarded them as a progressive liberation from dogma and superstition.
The change in the thrust of philosophy undoubtedly influenced the
attitude of the leading men of medicine. Thus it was in the Renaissance
that modern medicine, like the modern viewpoint in general, had its
beginnings.
Traditional concepts were increasingly challenged by the discoveries
of empirical science and of observational and later experimental
medicine. Attempts were made to explain biological phenomena and the
vital functions of life in physical and not metaphysical terms.
Paracelsus was the first seriously to challenge the Greek medical
tradition. He was an iatro-chemist whose hypotheses were based on his
knowledge of chemistry but showed little or no insight into human
physiology. None the less his doctrine of the three chemical principles
(sulphur, mercury, and salt, analogous to the ternary spirit, soul and
body) gave a powerful stimulus to fresh thinking.
The first really decisive blow against the Greek system of medicine
came a hundred years later in the seventeenth century with the discovery
of the circulation of the blood by Harvey. It undermined the basis of
classical Galenic physiology.
As time went by and knowledge became more reliable, the concept of
''vital spirit'' became more and more regarded as an anachronism, a
relic of discredited humoral theory.
The vis vitae was now identified with nervous energy. It appeared that
the brain and not the soul controlled the activities of the body. In a
materialistic economy there was no need for divine intervention. Man, it
seemed, had not been created as such but had evolved from pre-human
forebears by a process of natural selection and adaptation. The Biblical
account of creation might be read as an allegory, but it was not the
literal truth.
By contrast with the changes in secular thinking, the doctrine of the
Holy Spirit remained firmly entrenched in the teachings of the Church.
It upheld the belief that a human being was something more than the
''chemical mixt'', the ''hydraulic machine'', or the ''animated nervous
frame'' envisaged by contemporary empiricists. To it the speculations of
the ancients and the fathers of the Church were remarkably subtle and
felicitous attempts to do justice to the nature of reality, both human
and divine.
Inevitably the Church, on the one hand, and science (and to a lesser
extent medicine) on the other, began to disagree about fundamental
Church doctrine.
Physicians, who dealt with their patients as individuals and advised
them on matters of life and death, were less inclined than the
laboratory-based scientist to take an entirely materialistic view of
man. Nor were they so certain that human knowledge could not be
metaphysical. They tended to be ambivalent about the new thinking. In
spite of their growing scepticism, they were unwilling to distance
themselves from the traditional Christian ethos.
In the event, the theories formulated in what is now seen as a
transitional period in the development of medicine, between its ancient
and modern eras, did not stand the test of time. They had attempted to
explain biological phenomena in mechanical and chemical terms before
physiological processes were properly understood, and to classify
disease when there was little, if any, reliable information about its
etiology and pathogenesis.
From the nineteenth century onwards these interim theories were
gradually superseded by the more recent discoveries of the modern
sciences which are generally endorsed today. They have greatly extended
man's knowledge of the material world and thereby, for the most part,
brought him enormous benefits in many fields. Their place in medicine
has been firmly established. Modern theories and practices are based on
their discoveries.
Research in human biology, and most recently in molecular genetics,
has yielded at the cellular and molecular levels a mass of information
about the basic physical phenomena of the living state that would have
been inconceivable only a generation ago.
From what he has learnt about the early development of the fertilised
ovum, the morphology of the chromosomes, and the structure and role of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the physician has been able to devise and
introduce into clinical practice procedures to overcome problems in
conception, to detect carriers or genetic defects, to diagnose genetic
disorders ante-natally and to correlate them with defects in specific
genes. He has been enabled to initiate studies to assess the role of
gene therapy in inherited diseases and in other conditions like cancer.
It would seem that the biologist has identified the coded DNA of the
chromosomes of the reproductive cells as the means whereby, at
conception, ''life'' is conveyed from one generation to the next.
Notwithstanding all that is now known about the physical basis of
''life'', what ''life'' is essentially remains, like its origin, a
mystery. Furthermore, while man, in common with other living creatures,
can reproduce his kind, and in his case even initiate fertilisation
in-vitro, he cannot, any more than they, create ''life'' de novo.
Some years ago the scientist and Nobel laureate, the late Sir Peter
Medawar, was led to declare -- somewhat tautologically -- that there was
no known or conceivable limit to science's power to answer questions of
the kind that science can answer. Time will confirm the truth or expose
the error of Medawar's assertion but, even so, there are questions,
including, as he admitted, questions about first and last things and
about purposes, which it cannot answer.
Thus it seems that modern science, despite its achievements, is not
omniscient. Its premises confine it to the study of the phenomena of the
material world. Its methods and its empirical thinking preclude from its
considerations the higher realities, and so it is unconcerned with first
principles, spiritual truths, and ethics.
As a result, there are questions which modern science does not attempt
to or cannot answer. It is, therefore, not surprising that it has not
shed any light on the concept of ''vital spirit'' and has sought to
dismiss it as untenable and meaningless, and that it has also excluded
from its consideration the moral dilemmas to which its discoveries
sometimes give rise.
The dichotomy of opinion that was always likely to arise from the
disparity between the traditional and empirical viewpoints, as Sir
Thomas Browne pointed out in 1642, has only relatively recently become a
matter of public concern in medical practice.
Many of the procedures made possible by the recent advances in
molecular genetics have met with approval, but there has been
controversy about the propriety of some of them, such as in-vitro
fertilisation, therapeutic abortion for genetic disorders, gene transfer
between individuals and gender selection. Some of them, including the
question of the use of ova from aborted foetuses in in-vitro
fertilisation, raise unprecedented moral issues. There is a great deal
of apprehension about what their long-term consequences for mankind
might be.
The physician is constrained in his practice by an ancient code of
conduct at the heart of which is deep respect for human ''life''. He is
required to take actions which are ethically as well as scientifically
sound.
Science-based knowledge has transformed medicine but it has also made
the physician's role as arbiter of good practice much more demanding.
With his greater scope for intervention, the physician is more likely
nowadays to be involved in clinical situations where he has to decide
between what can and what should be done. He has to look elsewhere than
science for guidance about how to deal with the ethical issues and
resolve the moral questions with which contemporary developments in
medicine confront him.
Shakespeare recognised man's propensity to underestimate the ideas and
insights of his predecessors, among them some of the greatest minds in
human history. He reflected the new scepticism of his age with the
words: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are
dreamt of in your philosophy -- an admonition that is just as relevant
today as it was then.
Somehow I feel that if ever he is to penetrate ''life's'' ultimate
mystery, man will require a wider and deeper vision than that of
empiricism. In his search for enlightenment it would seem that he may
have to relearn that there are other paths to the truth besides the
scientific method.
Man can no more afford to ignore the principles of the philosophers
than reject the discoveries of the scientists.

YOU know it's the middle of August when the Early Learning Centre has
its new winter catalogue out. The Early Learning Centre, for those lucky
enough not to . . . er, sorry, those not blessed with young relatives,
is basically to the world of toys what Thirtysomething was to the world
of TV drama: it's the ultimate prissy, middle-class, commercial
enterprise. The catalogue, like the whole shop, is so smug that it could
make you puke faster than a post-curry Waltzer ride.
Honestly, it's so prissily self-important about its aim for kids (or
Young Adults), that you think someone should tell these guys that they
are not Oxfam or Friends of The Earth and that they're a bleeding toy
shop. Don't give us this crap when you're really trying to get people to
feel good about spending huge amounts of money on overpriced toys. Why
should people feel better about spending forty quid on a wooden train
set rather than a plastic Power Ranger model?
The worst thing about these toyshops (is ''Learning Centre'' not the
most pretentious name for a toyshop imaginable?) is the manipulation of
parents' guilt feelings. The ELC wants everyone to boycott ''violent''
toys and stick with constructive, instructional toys: the kind that in
my day used to be known as ''boring toys''.
''Buy these and you will give the kids a head start'', is the message
from the ELC. The platitudes practically drip from the page. ''It's a
simple vision; children learn more when they enjoy what they're doing .
. . you'll find no tanks or guns in our shops and we avoid toys that
rely on fashion or TV fads. We always ask . . . ''Will it help a child
develop?'' What a load of tosh.
They're even careful to let us know how much money they've raised for
Save The Children. Anyone knows that the amount raised is probably a
tiny fraction of the ELC's profits.
Despite what feminist nutters tell us, girls and boys at the earliest
stages of development have a completely different attitude to what sorts
of toys they want. This is largely an inborn sex difference. My daughter
has never shown any violent or destructive inclinations, except towards
her brothers, although admittedly she is only two.
She's the only one who has ever shown any interest in a dolly. She
takes it to bed with her, she feeds it, and she gives it a cuddle and
pats it on the back in an extremely cute way when she thinks it might be
a bit upset. She treats the baby as if she were its mother. Sometimes
she treats it as if she's the father, especially when she ignores it and
just sits watching the telly.
Boys copy images of violence. The cops, terminators, and VR Troopers
all carry guns, and it's only normal that they want to emulate these
role models.
Little girls don't use traditionally female weapons because not many
places stock plastic breadknives. These should be sold with a telephone
(unused) and a certificate proving the owner's status as a victim.
In today's overdeveloped society, parental guilt knows no bounds.
Advertisers know this all too well, and you can't buy anything for kids
without feeling uneasy. We've tried unsuccessfully to get our kids to
take all the so-called healthy cereals. Weetabix must be the worst.
Anyone who has tried to feed a toddler this stuff will know that after
half an hour in the plate, the Weetabix turns into the starting compound
for reinforced chipboard.
Its lack of taste goes some way towards explaining why our carpets are
always like a relief map of the Highlands. Any cereal that isn't chock
full of E additives, as far as kids are concerned, is just as big a
loser. After several months of persisting with the basic types, 80% of
each serving was still being chucked out every morning.
So, at first reluctantly, we bought them the kind of cereal that, as
kids ourselves, we would have been desperate for, the ones with the same
nutritional value as Tutti Fruities. Admit it, no-one wants a cereal
that tastes as if it was the first step in building a kitchen unit; we
all prefer the one that turns the milk chocolately.
The gun issue, unlike the cereal issue, has caused a great deal of
friction here. Recently in our house, as in America, there has been a
battle of wills regarding the right to bear arms. Our boys, aged three
and four, each decided some months ago that they wanted ''a gun that
goes bang'' or more accurately, a gun that goes BANG at a nerve-jangling
loudness with inordinate frequency.
Uncle Dave bought their first gun, and being Mr New Man, he tried to
buy one that would not lock, act, or sound like a gun. In these respects
it was a highly successful purchase. Pulling the trigger made the barrel
spin round, red lights flash, and out would come the kind of noise that
you might expect from a Dalek undergoing a protracted and painful death.
With this multitude of actions, it tended to use up batteries faster
than an MP's sex toy. It was soon hidden from sight.
In the weeks before our holiday, ''the gun that goes bang'' issue, or
cap-gate as it became known, had evolved. As anyone with kids, or even
just a wife, will know, several weeks of constant whining is enough to
wear down even the most determined individual.
After a week of whingeing, with no sign of me giving in, they had
started to ''improvise'', using other toys to make guns: on one occasion
facing each other down with firearms built from the ELC's ''stimulating
construction toy'' shouting ''Bang Bang Peowwwww''. For those not au
fait with childhood mores, this last word is the onomatopoeic sound of a
ricocheting bullet.
After refusing them a proper gun for weeks, I looked over the ELC
catalogue, trying to find if there was something wholesome that might
divert them from the thought of guns. I suddenly realised what a load of
tosh this was. I remember many happy hours spent playing at soldiers. If
you can ignore the indignity of it, then what harm did it do me? We all
wanted to be Americans, and as anyone could tell you, all American
soldiers are called Joe.
This was unfortunate, resulting in a constant stream of eight-year-old
boys running round the streets of Cumbernauld, shouting Peowwww in
genuine Cumbernauld American accents. At that time I had no idea what
dying or killing meant. For me, playing soldiers had as much to do with
the concept of violence as the average Scotland match has to do with
fancy skills. It was innocent, stimulating, enjoyable fun.
The memories flooded back; me being the most effective Joe on our
street. I realised that I should tell the bleeding-heart liberals to sod
off with their cod psychology. It was time for a gunfest in our house!
Once I'd fitted the guns out, the night was spent amid the nostalgic
fragrance of cap-smoke. The shouting went on for hours. ''Hey Joe, it's
Joe. Cover me and Joe while we go and rescue Joe. It looks like he's
been injured.''
In the morning I was in such a good mood, I even let the kids have a
shot.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie finds Forces Broadcasting still entertaining and
informing the military after 50 years
It began as a primitive affair, a criss-cross of wires held in place
by clips and hooks
FIFTY years ago, the British Forces Broadcasting Service (then Army
Broadcasting), made the opening announcement from its first permanent
base in Germany, the Musikhalle in Hamburg, which had miraculously
escaped the wartime bombs. This year, the present service celebrated the
event in a big weekend in that same Musikhalle.
But the start of Forces Broadcasting had come two years earlier on a
long-forgotten, Scottish wartime airfield, when three soldiers walked
out to an aircraft parked on the landing strip. They were Gale
Pedrick-Harvey, a journalist turned Colonel, a pre-war theatrical agent,
Major Emlyn Griffiths, and former BBC man, Major Phillip Slessor.
They were to form the first experimental army broadcasting station in
Algiers, ready for the invasion of southern Italy and the slow slog
north. Two months later, after scrounging equipment from every section
of Alexander's Army, Phillip Slessor and Tommy Trinder broadcast the
opening at New Year 1944.
It was a primitive affair, a criss-cross of wires and improvisation,
held in place by clips and hooks. A month or two later they were
sticking as close as they could to the front line in Italy, moving
steadily north in three mobile stations. Their adventures were many.
For the invasion of Europe, Forces Broadcasting simply duplicated the
Italian operation on a larger scale, and the five BLA (British
Liberation Army) broadcasting trucks followed the invading Army across
Europe, rarely more than 30 miles behind the lines. They were constantly
in close touch with their listeners who shared some of the same
hardships. They were led by Captain John McMillan, whom the army had
suddenly realised had been an executive with the International
Broadcasting Company. He later headed Central Television.
It was not an easy winter. The studios, enmeshed in camouflage, might
be warm but accommodation varied from billets and school halls to
freezing tents. But they were well aware what their broadcasts meant to
the listeners and, when the armies at last crossed the Rhine in March
1945, the broadcasters went with them.
All over the wartime and post-war world, Forces Broadcasting stations
had grown up, often on an ad hoc basis. Voices radiated out to troops in
places as diverse as Iceland, which gave Frank Muir, then a photographer
in the RAF, his chance; also Greece, Trieste, Austria, India and Radio
SEAC, in Ceylon, where Lord Mountbatten encouraged and backed his forces
service as very important for the continuing war against Japan.
Once the European war was over, studios and equipment were everywhere
for the taking and artists were eager for work. Forces Broadcasting in
Italy put out some memorable programmes -- the tenor Gigli from Rome,
and Toscannini, who conducted the first post-war concert for the
reopening of La Scala, Milan. BFBS in Italy also claimed the first
broadcast phone-in.
When war ended in Germany, the BLA trucks were close to Hamburg,
McMillan had been joined by Lt Col Eric Maschwitz, who had helped plan
the service. Married to Hermione Gingold, he was well known as the man
who wrote the lyrics for A Nightingale Sang in Berkley Square, and These
Foolish Things.
Desperate to find a permanent broadcasting home, at a time when few
would dispute an arbitrary take-over, McMillan and Maschwitz drove into
Hamburg. There, the Musikhalle, home of the Hamburg Philharmonic, was
shut and locked. They wrote Requisitioned for Army Broadcasting on Army
Form 80 (which bought anything at that chaotic time), signed it Bernard
L Montgomery, and stuck it on the door.
It was the start of a glorious era in the Musikhalle. Forces
Broadcasting has always had a cachet in Germany which made any artist
glad to appear. At first, conditions were dreadful for the civil
population and, when several came to work in the Musikhalle, as drivers,
clerks, typists, engineers, the station laid on a special canteen.
It was also a time when BFBS could ask for the Hamburg Philharmonic
for half a day and get it, and gradually German artists also began to
appear.
Through the Berlin Blockade and the airlift, the station continued and
then in one of the cutbacks for which the military is famous, BFN was
faced with huge staff cuts and a move to Cologne, a more logical base it
has to be said, in the British Zone.
In wartime, Forces Broadcasting had been filled by people with pre-war
BBC experience, but also with younger men and women to whom it gave a
direction for a career, a trend that continued even more strongly during
national service and after. It was not just in Germany but all over the
world. Radio sprang up wherever British forces were stationed -- in
Aden, Egypt, Kenya, Malta, Cyprus, Hong Kong, Belize and Brunei (the
last four are still broadcasting).
Look at any list of names in broadcasting and it is easy to see the
service has provided more people for it than any other organisation.
Wartime SEAC launched the careers of such stalwarts of the BBC, as
Macdonald Hobley, the first male announcer on BBC Television, actor
Desmond Carrington, and David Jacobs, whose faces are well known, as are
those of Derek Jones, Tim Gudgin, Raymond Baxter, Sarah Kennedy, and
dozens more. Much more widespread are those now working in broadcast
management.
The talents have reached beyond broadcasting. Welsh singer, Geraint
Evans had his first audition in Hamburg and during his service took the
chance of lessons with the great German baritone, Theo Hermann, paid for
by a whip-round for cigarettes, the most acceptable currency then, from
station staff.
Roger Moore, later ''James Bond'', and director Bryan Forbes are but
two more examples of many. BFBS also originates many memorable
programmes but, probably the best-known of all is still Family
Favourites which went on cheerfully even during the Berlin Airlift. It
brings to mind another name, Cliff Michelmore, whose on-air romance with
the programme's London link, Jean Metcalfe, became historic.
With the end of National Service, BFBS began to shrink. Stations
closed as Britain pulled out of former territories such as Aden and
Malta, and the process has continued.
Against that, the biggest event since Phillip Slessor launched the
Algiers Station in 1944, was the start of television in 1974. It was the
brainchild of Ian Woolf, who joined in Trieste and ended his career as
Director, BFBS, and television was guided through its infancy by John
Harrison, on secondment from BBC Television.
To bring British-style television to the forces and families in
Germany was a major task, requiring more than 700 miles of live
microwave link from London to Berlin, with some 45 transmitters along
the route.
Twenty years later, technology and events have overtaken the service.
In 1984, BFBS metamorphosed into the Services Sound and Vision
Corporation (covering radio, television and live entertainment) though
it retains its old name on air. Television programmes now go out from
Britain via the NASA satellite to forces all over the world, with local
input transmitted from London, though taped by local camera crews mostly
in Germany.
The end of the Cold War has brought the biggest changes in the swift
reduction of numbers in Germany and elsewhere, now down to around 80,
plus contributors and performers. It was a shock.
''But we've got our confidence back now,'' said Peter McDonagh, SSVC's
Director of Broadcasting. BFBS Radio had been swift to open a service
and a base during the Falklands War and now supplies most of the
island's programmes. A station in Northern Ireland opened in 1993. There
are also now two radio channels, BFBS 1, locally produced to keep in
close touch with the immediate audience, and BFBS 2, a mix of BBC Radios
3, 4 and 2, with some 25% own programmes. In the future, using an
up-link on the NASA Satellite, BFBS plans for an interactive function.
''My strategy is that by the year 2000,'' McDonagh said, ''every
serviceman and woman anywhere in the world will be able to pick up our
programmes by cable, satellite, superhighway or terrestrial
transmission.''

OERKENY: Hunters have shot 44 dogs in a small Hungarian village after
the mayor declared open season on strays. The unfortunate dogs,
including abandoned strays and those which may have simply jumped over
the garden gate, were shot in the village of Oerkeny, 25 miles from
Budapest. Hungary has no animal protection laws despite years of
pressure from animal rights campaigners.

DOCTOR Joel Fleischman falls foul to ''glacier dropsy'' on Northern
Exposure (Channel 4, Wednesday). Nursing increasingly surreal symptoms
such as an aversion to shrimp, a sensation of pins up his nose and
shivering, he retires to The Brick, the Alaskan town's restaurant/bar.
Owner Holling Vincoeur offers sound advice. ''Sit down before the
cramps come. I was so bad with them I put a shotgun in my mouth,'' he
warns, before his eyes soften and he smiles reassuringly: ''Luckily I
was too weak to pull the trigger.''
The American TV station behind the hit show which returns for its
fifth series to British screens this week adopted just such a blunt
approach to fans writing in recently to congratulate them. CBS
responded: ''We're glad you enjoyed Northern Exposure. Unfortunately the
show has been cancelled. We hope you'll enjoy the many new shows offered
on CBS this fall.''
So enjoy it while you can for the pleasure now will be part of the
pain then, when the quirky residents of Cicely, Alaska, stumble off the
schedules, into the frozen tundra of fuzz. The plug was pulled in the
states a fortnight ago at the end of series six.
It's a pity. Marvin Kitman of New York Newsday described the series as
''one of the five shows I'd kill to keep on the air''. Right now, he'll
be trying to spear the selfish schedulers with a giant moose rack.
The series arrived on the back of Twin Peaks, but the characters had
all been reflected in a candy-coated mirror. Instead of malevolence,
theirs is a land of benevolence, where neighbours (though not what they
might seem) are a purely, friendly flock.
''Has anybody died of this,'' Fleischman now sent to bed early with a
mustard wrap around his neck, later inquiresin this week's episode.
''Not in the last seven or eight years,'' soothingly explains Maggie,
the town's air-taxi pilot, grateful for an opportunity to be in his
bedroom if not in his bed.
Though wary of relationships -- five of Maggie's ex-boyfriends have
died in mysterious circumstances, the last being struck by a satellite
(it is not yet known if one of them succumbed to ''glacier dropsy'') --
she is determined not to let Joel slip away.
Not that she's much time. Rob Morrow who plays Fleischman quit at the
end of this series despite threats of a multi-million law-suit, so it
still remains to be see how their ''will they, won't they, why and
when'' boggie will spin out. Is it sad to take such vicarious pleasure
in the love-lifes of others, especially what amounts to a collection of
pixels?
While Chris, the philosophical drop-out/DJ organises and announces the
24-hour vigil for Fleischman elsewhere in the small town of Cicely life
does go on as normal. Ed continues to suffer from ''sleepflying'',
waking up in trees and roofs. ''Sometimes you're mind just goes to the
store for a six-pack!'' says Fleischman before being carted off and
replaced by Leonard, the Indian healer whose diagnosis is slightly more
specific.
He explains that Ed has been called by the spirit world to be a
shaman. Nothing like a town feud and it is nothing like a town feud when
Ruth Anne discovers that her grandfather was eaten by Holling's
grandfather in a bid to survive the Great Blizzard of 1897. Honestly
this is a degree in surrealism to make even the brightest fish feel like
a third-class failure.
Though it's the lines that leave you laughing. The show has the
ability to leave you smiling hours later and at the most inopportune
times. Shortly after you've been told about the death of your great
aunt, you remember the time when Chris tells Maurice. ''Your mind is
like the waters of the big muddy. It's deep where you think it's going
to be shallow and shallow where it should be deep.''
A favourite however is Chris's observation at the previous cancelled
wedding of Shelley, the twentysomething beauty Queen and Holling, not a
spring chicken. ''It's on occasions like this that my thoughts turn to
marriage. I think of the Dalai Lama, the Pope and Mother Teresa -- very
spiritual people who never took the plunge.''
The list of books Chris has read out on air includes Edna St Vincent
Millay's Renaissance and other Poems, Emmanuel Kant's Critique of Pure
Reason, Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time and E B White's
Charlotte's Web. That's a literature degree with only 50 fun minutes of
revision.
Northern Exposure fills the slot vacated by ER yet only one should be
on prescription from the NHS. Happy pills and magic chemical bullets are
a sure cure for the blues, but it takes something with the deep-rooted
charm, concern and comedy of this beautifully baked view of Alaska, to
drag you through autumn and winter.
* IT'S 20 years since The Sex Pistols decided to embrace anarchy in a
sweaty King's Road clothes shop and spawned punk. An enduring phenomenon
which though only lasting 18 months as a craze, still has it's
foot-soldiers all zipped up today. Punk And The Pistols (Sunday, BBC2)
celebrates the platinum date of a true musical milestone, with a
90-minute documentary on which Jon Savage, author of England's Dreaming,
acted as consultant.
''Punk was about great heroic things, not 'I'm going to spit in your
face''' said Radio 1's disc-guru John Peel. ''But when I saw the first
punk girls, I thought they should be taken into care for their own
protection.'' Contributors include John Lyndon (Johnny Rotten): ''The
Sex Pistols were big, after they ceased to exist'', and Vivienne
Westwood: ''Punk rock is the best exercise in rock'n'roll rebellion
that's ever been created.''
Malcom MacLaren is joined by music from Siouxsie Sioux, Captain
Sensible -- hopefully not performing Happy Talk -- and The New York
Dolls. The televisual package is completed by resurrecting The Young
Ones and showing the network premiere of Alex Cox's Sid And Nancy
(Vicious and Spungen) -- grim but great.
* THE word ''juxtapose'' is usually reserved for academic essays and
arts interviews, however it's one to spring from the thesaurus when
introducing a band as far removed from punk as something that exists 400
miles from London's King's Road.
Twenty-four hours before the punk revival Capercaillie's commemoration
to the 250th anniversary of the rising of the Jacobites at Glenfinnan,
Raising The Standard (BBC2, Saturday) is revealed. In a swamp of
anniversaries this is the easiest on the eyes, ears and heart. The
concert was filmed between dusk and dawn on Loch Shiel.
The songs performed were written around the time of the rebellion and
have been revitalised through modern arrangements. Perhaps the most
moving sequence is Sorley MacLean's elegy on Culloden performed by the
eminent Gaelic poet.
* AN army of single mums, now tarred and feathered, would rather see
John Redwood, MP, in the electric chair than the psychiatrist's comfy
sofa. Still a good grilling during The Anthony Clare Interview (STV,
Sunday) will have to suffice as the professor attempts to push past any
Vulcan mind-tricks and find the source of Redwood's grim view of social
reconstruction.
The transfer from radio to television of Professor Clare's in depth
inter-views is the long-toothed alternative to the sound-bite. Every
guest may still have his plug -- Gerry Adams on Sinn Fein's progress,
Bill Morris on the minimun wage, and Redwood on adoption schemes -- but
Clare can continue to set the agenda and shine a little white light into
the darker, dingier corners.
* OSCAR Wilde said: ''Morality is simply the attitude we adopt to
people we dislike.'' As a homosexual up against Victorian Britain he was
not only disliked but imprisoned, charged with ''indecency with male
persons''. Indecent Acts (C4, Tuesday) explores the secret homosexual
world of the 1890s, where prison cast a spectre over gay consenting
adults. To shock the system the film-makers compare then with now, a
world where lives continue to collapse under the weight of secret
meetings.
The documentary mixes moments from Wilde's arrest with the evidence of
a fraction of 1000 men prosecuted for indecency. As Oscar said:
''Scandals used to lend charm or at least interest to a man. Now they
crush him.''
* AFTER 20 years of running drink-sodden columns through the mangler
of The Spectator, Jeffrey Bernard decided to seek solace in sobriety.
Despite los-ing a leg, it was only when he assaulted a woman that he
finally acknowledged the severity of his drink problem. That women was
not Ruby Wax. The same cannot be said for the addiction patients she
visited at a clinic in Tucson Sierra.
In Ruby's Health Quest (BBC1, Tuesday) as well as chating to Bernard,
she watches women hug horses, while others unleash their feelings
against a solid-rock wall during a cliff climb, all in a bid to battle
the bottle, syringe or pills. Whatever the occasion, Ruby will always be
vinegar in an open wound; still it sure beats temperance marches.

JUDGE Lance Ito was cleared yesterday to continue presiding over the
O. J. Simpson double murder case when another judge ruled Ito's police
captain wife would not have to testify.
Los Angeles police captain Margaret York has no relevant testimony to
give in the case and cannot be called as a witness, Judge John Reid
ruled.
Had she been called, Ito would have had to disqualify himself from the
case, raising the possibility of a long hiatus in the 30-week-long
trial.
York allegedly is the subject of insulting remarks made on a tape
recording of former detective Mark Fuhrman, a key prosecution witness.
Defence attorneys claim Fuhrman could have planted some key evidence
and want to enter the tapes as evidence that he lied under oath.

WHEN IT became clear on Tuesday that the BBC intended to mark the 50th
anniversary of VJ Day with 11 hours and 40 minutes of cricket, this
reviewer almost threw in the towel. Plainly, the semi-finals of
something called the Nat West Trophy constitutes one of those events
which bring the nation together and to which the Corporation, dedicated
to social cohesion, has an iron-clad obligation. That wasn't the
problem.
Who was Mr West -- Nat to his friends -- and what did he do to deserve
this? More to the point, what did we do to deserve this? Has the BBC
exhausted its stock of road safety films? Is there a shortage of aged
Open University botany lessons introduced by long-haired men in flares
and lurid kipper ties? To get right down to it, how many Scots give a
googly about the Nat West Trophy?
Cricket, as has often been noted, is the quintessential English sport,
which is to say it is dull and incomprehensible, a finely-judged affair
striving for exquisite tedium but ready to settle, after a break for
tea, for simple monotony. It is graceful in the way a John Major speech
is graceful, poetic as a final reminder from the Inland Revenue, and as
watchable as a Radio 4 shipping forecast. The next time BBC Scotland
demands more opt-outs only one phrase need be offered in argument:
''With commentary by Geoffrey Boycott.''
Queen Margaret Drive might use the time thus won to broadcast more
work as fine as George Hume's Focal Point: War Guilt -- Paying for The
Past (BBC2, Thursday), first shown three-years ago but none the worse
for that.
In a week of programmes devoted to the depravity of the species, this
said more about the meaning of the argument over Japan's inability to
apologise for its war crimes than far longer works managed.
The dignity of old soldiers, the men who ''sacrificed their todays for
all our tomorrows'', is a precious thing, perhaps because they did not
seek it, perhaps because the rest of us will never touch the wells from
which it springs.
In Hume's piece it came over as a heroic refusal to accept the weasel
words of governments or the glosses of experts. It was something more
than a demand for apology or compensation. It was, rather, a refusal to
surrender the truth, even after 50 years. In that war, these old men
remain prisoners.
Hume's programme was only one of many this week, of course, raising
the question -- bizarre when set beside the numbing hours of meaningless
sporting events inflicted on us -- if the anniversary of VJ Day has not
somehow been diminished by television's efforts to mark its passing.
Given the stories told in Hume's piece, or in Charles Wheeler's equally
brilliant Burma -- The Forgotten War (BBC1, Monday), Sue Lawley's News
45 VJ-Day (BBC1, Tuesday) could thus seem risible, a contrived, almost
patronising effort to make recent history digestible for an indifferent
public.
Equally, the decision to re-run an episode of Tenko (BBC1, Monday)
looked faintly insulting. This was a fine series in its day,
well-written, emotionally scrupulous and as tasteful as these things can
be. Nevertheless, it was fiction, and when the truth is so overpowering
a writer's imagination can seem a tawdry thing. Barbarism doesn't arrive
in 55-minute episodes.
You could make the same comment on Channel 4's assortment of
programmes on capital punishment. Was it wise to show The Executioner's
Song (Tuesday and Wednesday), a movie derived from Norman Mailer's
''factoidal'' account of Gary Gilmore's final months on earth, alongside
the brief, true accounts offered in Death Row Stories (nightly)?
However fine the performance of Tommy Lee Jones, what could acting
ever really mean -- and never mind C4's dubious decision to split the
picture, mini-series style, into two episodes -- set beside grisly
reality?
The question was brought home during Thursday's After Dark Special
(Channel 4). As is usual with ''open-ended'' discussion programmes, the
debate on judicial murder looked to be going nowhere. Positions were
settled, opinions fixed. A defence lawyer, a policeman, a psychologist,
a convicted murderer and a victim's widow were arrayed before us, each
saying exactly what was expected of them.
Then a fat, smiling American spoke. This was Don Cabana, a professor
of Criminal Justice from Mississippi but once a prison governor and
once, indeed, an executioner. Quietly, and with some effort, he
described exactly what happens when cyanide is released into the
chamber, when the gas touches the skin, when the convulsions and the
soiling begins, and how it all affects those whose job it is to carry
out the orders of the state.
At one execution, Cabana recalled, he had almost broken down. The only
words he could find were a plea to the condemned man: ''Just breathe.
Please, just breathe.'' Yet with the awful blind tenacity of the
species, even when facing the inevitable, the man had tried to avoid the
gas right to the very end.
It was a simple, unvarnished account, and the most riveting piece of
television this week. In the small hours, with only a handful of people
watching, a fat American explained why he opposed the death penalty. Yet
in the eyes of the widow sitting nearby, a woman who had watched her
husband endure an agonising, lingering death, there was not a flicker of
emotion, not a hint of pity. Fiction bows, or ought to bow, to these
realities.
As though to prove the point, Prisoner: Cell Block H (ITV, Thursday),
it is pleasing to report, meantime continues to maintain staggeringly
high standards in the field of consummate, shameless trash. Put it this
way: anything so whole-heartedly awful, so superbly dire, can only be
the product of immense effort from people who care deeply about their
art.
Thus, in the small hours of Friday morning Joan found Terri in bed
with a man, an offence which, as devotees will be aware, is the next
worst thing to finding a plausible line in the script. This was the cue
for a display of bravura weeping the like of which we haven't seen since
Lassie last came home. And dialogue! ''Dennis is coming along very well.
Of course, he still can't walk . . .'' A classic of its kind, of which
it is one-of-a, thank God.
Finally, a question. If Michael Parkinson was once able to achieve
interviews as richly-entertaining as his chat with Orson Welles,
repeated on Wednesday night (BBC1) what logic, what banal concept of
programming by numbers, will soon foist Going for a Song on him, and on
us?

THERE were slightly fewer and somewhat more nervous tourists on the
Champs Elysees yesterday following the bomb blast on Thursday evening
which had injured 16 people, three of them seriously.
Police, who have carried out thousands of on-the-spot identity checks
since the bomb in the Metro at Saint Michel three weeks ago killed seven
people and injured 86, yesterday demanded reinforcements in Paris and
greater powers -- in particular, the right to search cars without a
warrant.
President Jacques Chirac appeared yesterday to have chosen a lower
profile reaction than he did after the Saint Michel blast, to show the
government would not be rattled. He refused to interrupt his summer
holidays to return to Paris, but dispatched Prime Minister Alain Juppe
to the scene of the blast.
According to forensic scientists, the two rudimentary bombs which
exploded in Paris this summer have many similarities. The most credible
hypotheses, but not, so far, the slightest shred of evidence or any
serious claim of responsibility, point to Algerians as being behind both
operations.
The unspoken question is whether the French authorities can stop the
terrorists. The spate of Paris bombings in 1986, to which the latest two
are often and abusively compared, were carried out by Tunisians and
Moroccans, manipulated by the Islamic regime in Iran.
The gang was arrested thanks to information given by Tunisian Islamic
Fundamentalists to Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. It seems unlikely
that his highly personalised intelligence network will have survived his
departure from office last May.
During the last few years of the Algerian civil war, in which more
people have been killed than during 25 years of troubles in Northern
Ireland, France has consistently, albeit discreetly helped the
beleaguered government in Algiers -- mainly by engineering EC loans.
Recently, according to Arab sources, President Chirac personally
promised King Hussan of Morocco and President Hosni Moubarak of Egypt
that he would crack down even harder than at present on Islamist
activities among France's several million strong Muslim populations.
Last December, French anti-terrorist police shot dead the Islamist
hijackers who had taken an Algerian airbus to Marseilles, hence the
temptation to see the Paris bombs as Holy War revenge.
In the emotional turmoil following the two recent Paris attacks, most
people have assumed that Islamist extremists, either the GIA or the AIS,
both armed groups related to the outlawed Algerian FIS (Islamic
Salvation Front), are guilty.
The vital question, A qui profite le crime, is more complicated than
that and the hypothesis that Algerian secret services were behind the
bombings, whilst less comfortable, is just as plausible.
The recently restored strength of the Algerian government, of which
its promise to organise a presidential election this autumn is a sign,
makes it suspect in the eyes of some Arab observers.
But any compromise between the Islamic Fundamentalists and the Algiers
authorities would have no room for the armed extremists.
It is probable that the GIA was behind the shooting in a Paris mosque
on July 11 of an Imam, Abdel Baki Sahraoui, co-founder of the FIS. The
Imam had been warned, in a communique published by GIA a few days before
hand, to break off his negotiations with the Algerian government ''in
the name of the Holy War''.
Extraordinarily, the French authorities had known all this was going
to happen. Ten days before the murder of Sahraoui, the Algerian paper La
Tribune reported the arrival in France of a five-man hit squad who
planned to kill the Imam and carry out bomb attacks.
The article said the group was due to split up and travel to Germany
and Belgium. French police ascertained the gas container used in the
Metro blast three weeks ago was made in Belgium. And the killers of
Sahraoui left behind them a bag containing a Belgian coin. Tipped off
about the group, French police hunted but failed to find them. The hunt
is now on in Belgium and Germany, before the next bomb goes off.

Kashmir, Friday
THE separatist Al-Faran group holding Keith Mangan, 34, and Paul
Wells, 23, an American, and a German claimed today they are all safe and
healthy. However, it offered no evidence.
The guerrillas said India planned to launch a military raid to rescue
the captive tourists and threatened to kill them if it did.
''Al-Faran has expressed its surprise over the government's plans to
launch a military operation for the rescue of the tourists,'' the group
said in a statement delivered to a news agency in Srinagar.
MP Tim Devlin, who represents Mr Mangan's parents, said the group had
promised Indian officials they would provide photographs, tape
recordings, and answers to questions only the hostages could know within
48 hours in talks through an intermediary this Wednesday.
Al-Faran is demanding the release of 15 jailed militants and has
already executed a fifth hostage. The headless body of Norwegian Hans
Christian Ostroe was found on Sunday with a note threatening to kill the
others if the demands were not met by Tuesday.
India says a rescue mission is not on the agenda, and that Britain,
Germany, and the US have all advised against it because of the risks to
the lives of the captives.
However, unconfirmed reports that the SAS and the US Delta force are
in Kashmir alongside an Indian elite police commando unit have fuelled
speculation that a mission is being seriously considered.
Scotland Yard police officers with experience of dealing with
guerrilla groups and hostage-takers have been in India for three weeks
to advise on handling the crisis.

SINN Fein President Gerry Adams has been offered fresh peace talks by
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew in a bid to break the
peace process deadlock in the province before the first anniversary of
the ceasefire.
Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram, responsible for political
development, confirmed that dates have been offered to Mr Adams before
the August 31 anniversary, or in early September.
But he made it clear that Sir Patrick will not drop the British
Government's precondition for progress that IRA arms must be
decommissioned before Sinn Fein is allowed into full all-party talks.
He rejected calls by Church leaders in Ireland and SDLP leader John
Hume for immediate all-party meetings.
Mr Ancram denied claims that the talks were in crisis.
He said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ''I have always seen peace
as a very fragile flower which constantly needs tending and constantly
needs movement. I wouldn't say the situation is one of crisis at the
moment. There are problems; they have to be resolved.
''We as a government are committed to trying to establish a lasting
peace and finding a political accommodation that will underpin that
peace.
''But we believe it has to be done in a sustainable way . . . and a
real indication of a commitment by Sinn Fein to exclusively peaceful
methods is in doing something about arms.''
Asked if another meeting was being sought between Mr Adams and Sir
Patrick, Mr Ancram added: ''Yes, we believe another meeting is useful.
We have put forward certain dates to Sinn Fein, at the end of this month
and the beginning of next, and we are waiting to hear from them.''
Mr Ancram said he believed the meetings they had in July were useful
in ensuring there were no misunderstandings. They allowed the Government
to make clear its commitment to its own principles and explore ways
through some of the difficulties that faced them.
The Government was not dragging its feet. ''We have put forward those
dates because we believe dialogue is all-important . . . we have made
clear we are prepared to meet them.''
Mr Ancram said the Government had to be confident Sinn Fein's
commitment to peace was real. Referring to Mr Adams's remark last week
at a rally about the IRA ''not having gone away'', and the fact that not
one bullet or one ton of Semtex had been handed in since August 31 last
year, he said that must put a question mark over that commitment.
A summit between the Prime Minister and Mr John Bruton, the Irish
Taoiseach, has been earmarked for early September.

THE latest US manoeuvres in the Persian Gulf were provoked by Saddam
Hussein's two sons-in-law who fled to Jordan last week. They told
American officials Saddam had been considering invading Kuwait or Saudi
Arabia.
American intelligence had already reported the Iraqi armed forces were
on the move, though they have not yet crossed the 32nd parallel. After
the Gulf War and the uprisings against the regime that followed, the UN
ruled the Iraqi army and air force could not operate below the parallel.
It was not at all clear whether the movements represented a dispersal
of Iraqi units, to preclude a coup, or the first steps towards an
invasion of Kuwait. Such an attack would be an act of desperation, and
possibly Saddam merely wanted to test his army and annoy the Americans.
The same thing happened last October.
The US has about 20,000 men near the Gulf, mostly in the fleet but
also on the ground in Kuwait. Equipment for reinforcements is being
moved into the Gulf from positions in the Indian Ocean, near Diego
Garcia.
The long-planned Operation Infinite Moonlight is taking place now,
backed by the aircraft-carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in the eastern
Mediterranean.
However, Saddam has perhaps other concerns right now: an opposition
group announced today a long list of senior officers who have been
arrested since the defections of General Hussein Kamel and his brother,
both of them married to Saddam's daughters.
The two are cousins of Saddam Hussein's, and are members of the
Tikriti clan that has governed Iraq since the 1960s. The men arrested
since the defections are presumably connected to Hussein Kamel.
Specialists here do not believe the Iraqi regime is about to collapse,
but they believe its days are numbered. There is much discussion of how
the US and its allies should respond if Saddam is suddenly deposed, or
if there is a general uprising against him.

* Three petrol bomb attacks in Northern Ireland have damaged two
houses and a Catholic church hall. Police said one of the attacks, in
the Protestant Doagh area of Newtownabbey, County Antrim, was sectarian.
A petrol bomb was thrown at the house in Anderson Court at 1am,
breaking a window and causing scorch damage. A second bomb was found at
the front door. No-one was hurt.
In the second house attack, at Queensway, Dunmurry, outside Belfast,
the roof caught fire after two devices were lobbed at the building from
an elevated railway line at the rear. Again no-one was hurt.
The third attack was at a Catholic church hall used by a
cross-community playgroup at Annacloy, County Down. It was hit by two
petrol bombs some time in the past 12 days, police said yesterday, but
only minor scorch damage was caused to the front of the building.

AMERICAN and Jordanian troops began manoeuvres to the west of Iraq
yesterday as the heat was turned on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein after
the defection of his sons-in-law and other top aides.
However, Baghdad dismissed what it called the ''commotion of the
enemies'' as less than ''the croak of frogs''.
Iraq also denied it was involved in any unusual military activity
following reports of movements towards Kuwait.
More than 2500 US Marines, backed by armour and joined by a similar
number of Jordanian troops, started exercises codenamed Infinite
Moonlight in desert areas of central and southern Jordan, at some points
just 200 miles from the Iraqi border.
At the same time, American Assistant Secretary of State Robert
Pelletreau and President Clinton's Special Assistant Mark Parris held
talks with Jordan's King Hussein, reportedly asking Jordan to
''disengage'' its economic ties with the Iraqi regime.
Jordan buys its oil from Iraq and has been Baghdad's lifeline to the
outside world since UN sanctions were imposed.
The US envoys are also expected to visit major oil producers Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait to ask them to resume oil supplies to Jordan in the
event that Amman decides to cut off its purchases from Iraq.
In Kuwait, the American embassy announced that more US troops,
including a battalion-sized task force, are to arrive in the next few
days to stage exercises and boost security.
''Timing of this Intrinsic Action exercise is related to the current
situation,'' an embassy statement said.
This exercise, part of a series of Kuwaiti-American war games, will
involve about 1400 US soldiers.
''In addition to providing an excellent opportunity for coalition
training, Intrinsic Action also serves a deterrent effect. The exercise
is one of a number of steps that the US is taking to enhance security in
the Gulf,'' the embassy said.
Diplomats said they understood the exercises had been brought forward
because of the defection earlier this month of the top-level Iraqi
members of Saddam Hussein's regime.
American forces are not stationed in Kuwait but Washington keeps an
arsenal of heavy armour there for use by troops who would rush to the
Gulf in the event of an emergency.
The Pentagon said on Thursday it was moving warships and military
supplies toward the Gulf to deter possible action by Saddam's military.
Troops in America have also been warned to be ready to move.
Although no large military force has shown up on Kuwait's borders, one
official said: ''The posturing of forces in the Baghdad area and south
of the Baghdad area were of such a nature as to cause us concern.''
He said Iraqi soldiers were moving out of their garrisons in convoy
formations, something they do not usually do for training exercises.
''This is a cause for concern because moving in convoy formations lets
them travel greater distances in less time, so reducing warning time if
Saddam really planned to invade Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
''We cannot afford to delay activity or action in response to what we
perceive to be challenges by Iraq,'' an official said.

<HEADLINE>Agency 'harassing overpaid claimants'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976814159</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government's Benefits Agency yesterday was accused of intimidating
and harassing claimants who had been overpaid because of its own errors.
Liberal Democrat social security spokeswoman Liz Lynne said she had
evidence the agency was demanding that claimants repay cash paid to them
in error -- in breach of its own guidelines, under which overpayments
arising from official mistakes are not recovered and are written off.
Her attack comes after a recent National Audit Office report estimated
the agency mistakenly overpaid #540m in income support benefits last
year. It found the accuracy of income support payments had declined
sharply from 95.7% in 1991-92 to 86.6% last year.
Ms Lynne called on Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley -- who
recently pledged a #1000m crackdown on benefit fraud -- to turn his
attention to the problems caused by erroneous payments. She said
claimants who were mistakenly overpaid had often spent the extra money
by the time the error was realised and were in no position to pay it
back.
''The Benefits Agency should not be trying to claw back money lost
through its own inefficiency by intimidating claimants,'' she said.
A spokesman for the agency strongly denied that officials tried to
harass or intimidate claimants into returning money. However, he said,
when claimants realised they were receiving money they were not entitled
to, the agency had a duty to try to recover it.
''We are not here to cause hardship to our customers,'' he said.

A HOME RULE Scottish Government should open negotiations with the
British Government in London to discuss guarantees for its future
existence in the form of a treaty ratified by the international
community, a Labour MP has suggested.
The question of entrenchment will be on the agenda of the Scottish
Labour Party executive meeting in Stirling today, which will decide on a
final approach for the forthcoming Scottish Constitutional Convention on
issues such as the number of members of the parliament in Edinburgh and
arrangements for gender equality.
However, the question of entrenchment has been pushed much further by
Falkirk West MP Dennis Canavan, in a letter to convention chairman Canon
Kenyon Wright. This draws on the logic of the Claim of Right document,
signed by most Scots Labour MPs, to suggest a stance on the sovereignty
of the Scottish people which is virtually nationalist in its rationale.
''Members of the Scottish Constitutional Convention signing the Claim
of Right acknowledged the sovereign right of the Scottish people to
determine the form of government best suited to their needs,'' writes Mr
Canavan, arguing that it would be unacceptable if Westminster retained
the power to abolish the Edinburgh parliament.
Mr Canavan goes further, however, by referring to the ''basic
contradiction between the sovereignty of the Scottish people as
expressed in the Claim of Right and the alleged sovereignty of the Crown
in parliament.''
A parliament created by Westminster could be abolished by Westminster,
he said, and this would be completely unacceptable. To avoid this, he
suggested that, after the establishment of the Scottish parliament, a
Scottish government could enter into a ''contractual agreement or
treaty'' with the British Government to entrench its future powers.
''The treaty could perhaps be registered with the United Nations or
European Union or both,'' writes Mr Canavan.
''This would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for any future
British Government to abolish the Scottish parliament. It would also
ensure international recognition of the sovereignty of the Scottish
people.''
Mr Canavan's contribution to the sovereignty debate will be his second
unpopular contribution in a week, so far as the Labour leadership is
concerned. Last week, he criticised Mr Tony Blair for abandoning
historic party policies and for pushing changes through without proper
debate.
Now his talk of a future Scottish government negotiating a treaty with
a British Government will go uncomfortably far down the road towards
implying Scottish independence.

BALMORAL CASTLE, with its rich history of mystery and romance, is what
made Deeside Royal and is the magnet which lures thousands of tourists
into the valley of the Dee.
It draws people from around the world even though, at the height of
the season, they are unable actually to see the castle.
As visitors cross the bridge which Prince Albert built in 1857 to link
the north and south Deeside roads, they are greeted with the message
''Grounds closed until 29 April, 1996.''
''Buckingham Palace was closed for work when we were in London and now
we won't see Balmoral,'' said Napoleon and Louise Leduc from Montreal,
who are touring Britain. ''We are not having much luck.''
At the shop outside the entrance to the estate those who had looked
forward to seeing how royalty live are told that the only way to see
Balmoral is to buy a postcard.
All they can do is gaze through the wrought iron gates which a local
blacksmith crafted 70 years ago and imagine what is going on at the
other side of the magnificent white spruce, giant fir and silver fir
which obscure their view.
Speculation this week has centred on the activities of Prince Edward
and his girlfriend Sophie Rhys-Jones and whether they will emerge from
the Highland love nest to announce their engagement.
The tension has been heightened by the publication of Edward's
biography this week detailing an alleged dalliance with a young Balmoral
maid when he was a teenager.
But few really know what takes place inside the grounds of Balmoral
during the royal family's annual holiday and that is perhaps why they
enjoy its solitude so much.
We will never know the details of the relationship between Queen
Victoria and her trusted servant John Brown, nor discover the truth
about the alleged conquests of young royals through the generations but
romances have blossomed and withered and died at Balmoral.
If Edward and Sophie do marry perhaps a cairn will be built within the
grounds, just as one was following the wedding of Prince Frederick
William of Prussia and the Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of
Victoria and Albert, in 1858.
It was at Balmoral that he asked for Princess Victoria's hand but they
had to wait a year or two for the ceremony because she was only 14.
For a spell it was a tradition to construct a cairn to mark a royal
wedding but the last one was built more than a century ago.
Balmoral is the Queen's private property rather than a royal palace,
and she and her family cherish their privacy but even so there are many
clues to life at Balmoral to be found within the grounds during the
three months of the year when they are open to the public.
Deeside's royal history can be traced back to a spell of bad weather
at Ardverikie in Inverness-shire in 1847 during the third visit to
Scotland by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
The weather spoiled their stay but while they were there Sir James
Clark, the Queen's physician, received a letter from his son who was
convalescing at Balmoral, describing the ''blue skies and fine weather''
on Upper Deeside.
Prince Albert, basing his decision on weather reports, a plan of the
house, and water-colours, decided to acquire the lease of the castle as
a Scottish residence for his wife.
The entry in Queen Victoria's diary on the evening she arrived to take
possession would be as apt now as it was on September 8, 1848.
''It was so calm and so solitary, it did one good as one gazed around;
and the pure mountain air was most refreshing. All seemed to breathe
freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad
turmoils.''
Deeside won her heart but the castle was too small and five years
later she laid the foundation stone for the existing castle which was
completed in 1856 and the old castle, 100-yards away, was demolished. A
stone now marks where it stood.
The pattern of life has changed little at Balmoral since Victoria's
day. The royals still hunt and fish, have their picnics and go riding
through the estate, although nowadays it is sometimes mountain bikes
they mount rather than horses.
Throughout the estate there are hitching posts at the popular stopping
places.
At Glen Gelder a scar is clearly visible across the moor which is
known as The Ditch. Prince Albert enjoyed shooting but wasn't too keen
on messing his clothes up by crawling through the heather so The Ditch
was dug to enable him to walk to an appropriate point out of sight of
his prey, and then pop up and have a shot.
The area remains popular with Prince Charles but when he is shooting
he uses more traditional stalking methods.
All through the estate there are cairns and monuments which are
pinpointed in the guidebooks published in French, German and English. As
well as the wedding cairns there are memorials to family members and
statues of the royals' favourite dogs.
There is also a statue of Victoria's Highland servant John Brown, who
lies buried in the old cemetery at Crathie just a stone's throw from the
gates of Balmoral, but there is no mention of it in the guidebooks.
The statue Victoria commissioned once stood proudly near the castle
itself, but Edward VII, keen to eliminate anything that reminded him of
John Brown, banished the statue to a heavily wooded area of Balmoral
behind the dairy, which is hard for visitors to find.
However, John Brown still stands proud, wearing his ''Albert'' watch
chain. From it hangs a threepenny-bit with the side bearing his
mistress's head closest to his heart. The plinth bears her tribute:
''Friend more than Servant, Loyal, Truthful, Brave, Self less than duty,
even to the grave.''
Visitors are free to wander the grounds and admire the gardens during
May, June and July when the ballroom, the largest room in the castle, is
also open to the public to allow them to admire exhibitions of works and
furniture from the castle. These include paintings by Landseer,
furniture supplied by Holland &amp; Sons for the new castle in 1855, silver
candelabra and mementos of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
All sorts of mementos are on sale in the shops within the grounds.
Once trinkets were sold at the Old Post Office near the castle gates
but apparently commercial necessity forced Balmoral to explore every
revenue possibility, the shops opened and as a result the Post Office
closed.
Visitors, it would appear, will buy anything with Balmoral stamped on
it. You can buy Balmoral Castle magnetic backgammon, Balmoral Castle
shoe-shine kits, thimbles, pot pourri, shortbread, and you can even dry
your dishes on the royal corgies if you are prepared to shell out #3.25
for a cloth.
Then there are the postcards of the royals with their Highland ponies,
with their Highland cattle, with their dogs, and in all sorts of
''relaxed'' poses.
When the gates close for the season at the end of July the preparation
work starts for the arrival of the family in mid-August.
The private quarters are, I am reliably informed, tasteful and
traditional and many of the rooms are carpeted in old tartan patterns
dating back to Queen Victoria.
The restaurant where a few weeks earlier tourists flocked to buy
venison burgers is turned into a social area for the staff, who may well
be EastEnders fans for the bar there is affectionately known as The
Queen Vic. There are fancy-dress dances for the staff and it is
traditional for one of the royals to be the judge but the highlights of
their stay are the two ghillies' dances which are held in the ballroom.
The Queen Mother in recent years has had to be content to watch the
dancing and tap her feet but for many years she had a reputation for
being one of the most enthusiastic dancers, leaving a string of
breathless partners in her wake.
One of the few formal occasions during the royal holiday is the annual
weekend visit of the Prime Minister, who normally accompanies the royal
family to Sunday worship at Crathie Kirk, making the short journey in
limousines along the route lined with tourists.
The privacy of the royals is carefully guarded at Balmoral with the
responsibility inside the grounds falling to the Metropolitan Police and
outside to Grampian Police.
Hi-tech equipment rings the estate but the security system has caused
its lighter moments. On one occasion police raced to a bedroom when one
of the panic buttons was pressed, only to find Prince William, then a
toddler, exploring.
Apparently a requirement for an officer on duty within Balmoral is the
ability to keep out of sight of the royals.
''You don't see many police in the grounds,'' said one regular
visitor, ''but they are up every tree; in fact, some of the trees might
be police!''
Keeping quiet is also a good idea if one tale is to be believed. An
officer was allegedly plodding back and forth on a gravel path in front
of the castle in the early hours of one summer morning when calls from a
window which burst open made it clear he should desist.
The following year the gravel path was tarmacadamed.
The Queen can be expected at the Crathie Kirk sale of work, Princess
Diana regularly took her children swimming to the nearby Craigendarroch
Hotel and Country Club and other family members still use the leisure
facilities, and in Ballater royal warrant signs abound.
William Johnston, a partner in Balmoral suppliers Sheridans the
butchers, said apart from the boost to business which supplying the
castle provides, tourists like the idea of buying goods from the same
shops as the royals and that helps business.
He confessed that even the Ballater residents were always hoping to
catch a glimpse of a royal. In fact, his driver had spotted Edward and
Sophie in the grounds just an hour earlier, presumably as he delivered
some of their ''award-winning sausages.'' ''And what were they doing?''
I inquired, but I still await a reply.
If you stroll along the banks of Loch Muick you might be lucky enough
to spot a royal picnic at Glassalt Shiel, the lodge which Victoria built
because after Albert's death she could not bear to stay at nearby
Alt-na-Giuthasach, a favourite hideaway for the couple.
Cricketers and golfers also stand a chance of glimpsing the royals.
Crathie Cricket Club, which is in the second division of the local club
league, plays on the lawn of Balmoral, enjoys the use of a thatched
pavilion, and is occasionally watched by the royal family.
The estate also has its own golf course and members of Balmoral Golf
Club, open to all local residents, can continue to play during the royal
holiday.
There have been those within the royal family who have not enjoyed the
pleasures which Balmoral can offer but its popularity appears assured
for many years to come with Prince Charles, like Victoria, growing
fonder of Balmoral with each passing year.
The Deeside business community, grateful for 148 years for a
fortnight's bad weather at Loch Laggan, hopes that he passes his
affection down to his sons.

THE Conservative Party yesterday confirmed that its financial
situation remains critical with less than 18 months to go before the
next General Election. Despite reducing its overdraft with the Royal
Bank of Scotland by #4.4m to #11.4m, it faces debts of more than #17m.
Presenting the party's annual report, party chairman Brian Mawhinney
focused on the increase in donations from business and constituencies,
and on the achievement of a #2m surplus for the second year after
several years of deficits.
However, the overall picture remains grim. Despite an extensive
programme of cost-cutting, the party succeeded only in repaying #2m in
debt last year, casting doubts on its ability to finance its next
election campaign.
Its overdraft with the Royal Bank was reduced but only thanks to a
#2.3m interest-free loan which must be repaid by March. That and loans
from constituencies of #3.6m bring the #11.4m debt to #17.3m.
Dr Mawhinney said: ''I am particularly pleased, contrary to
suggestions in the media, that donation income is also significantly up,
as are donations from constituencies.''
Company donations rose from #9.3m to #12.7m last year and constituency
contributions, until recently in decline, rose to more than #850,000.
Despite cost cutting, expenditure in Scotland rose by #19,000 to
#594,000 in 1995.

A HEARING has been arranged for the High Court in Edinburgh which
could lead to further developments in the battle between the men
convicted of the Glasgow Ice Cream War murders, Thomas Campbell and
Joseph Steele, and the Crown over the validity of their convictions.
The central figure in the 1984 trial was William Love, a known
criminal and perjurer, upon whose evidence the entire Crown case rested
but who has subsequently claimed repeatedly that he was lying at the
trial.
When the lawyer for Campbell and Steele, Mr John Carroll, finally won
a new Crown investigation into Mr Love's retractions, the Crown Office
dismissed the idea of charging Mr Love with perjury because there was,
in their words, insufficient reliable evidence.
Mr Carroll maintains that the reliability or otherwise of any evidence
had to be a matter for a jury. After the Crown's dismissal, he
petitioned to have the statements of the witnesses interviewed by the
Crown released to Mr Campbell and Mr Steele, including those of Mr Love
and his relatives.
This was refused but the Justiciary Office has now granted leave for a
petition to be served on Glasgow's procurator-fiscal, Strathclyde Chief
Constable Mr Leslie Sharp, and on the Lord Advocate.
A hearing has been fixed for October 25 to consider the merits of the
application for a warrant to compel the authorities to comply.
Mr Carroll said: ''We understand that Love was questioned by police
officers at great length and on tape, and that other selected witnesses
were also spoken to. We would like access to that material.''

A PIONEERING project to redevelop defective Orlit housing in Irvine
could act as a model for other parts of Scotland, a Government Minister
said yesterday.
The #5.6m scheme involves a partnership between a housing association
and a private developer and has been co-ordinated by Scottish Homes.
A total of 114 Orlit houses, owned by Scottish Homes, have been
demolished, and 78 new houses for rent and 47 for sale have been built
in three phases.
Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson was visiting the
development by the West of Scotland Housing Association and Beazer Urban
Development at Bank Street, Irvine.
He explained that it was the first of its kind developed by Scottish
Homes to tackle the problems of structurally defective housing built
using non-traditional building materials in the immediate post-war
period.
It was a model which was now being considered for wider application in
other parts of Scotland.
The Orlits in Irvine were built by the Scottish Special Housing
Association (now Scottish Homes) when traditional building materials
were in short supply, and were designated by the Government as being
structurally defective in 1984.

LAWYERS for Nelson and Winnie Mandela maintained a public silence
yesterday about the South African president's orders to arrange a
divorce from his estranged wife.
The reported marital break-up comes four months after Mandela fired
his wife from her Cabinet post and three years after they separated.
Mrs Mandela, 60, was returning yesterday to Johannesburg from Cape
Town, where she had been attending parliament, to ave further talks with
her lawyers, said her spokesman, Alan Reynolds.
Meanwhile, aides for Mandela, 77, denied he abruptly cancelled a
luncheon with the directors of an Afrikaans-language newspaper chain in
Pretoria due to stress.
''He had to go to a function yesterday evening in Cape Town, and
there's another function in Cape Town tonight,'' said spokesman Joel
Netshitenzhe. ''It meant flying cross-country an extra time.''

POLICE yesterday appealed for the help of regulars at Edinburgh pubs
in their hunt for the killer of a young woman whose decomposed body was
found in a drain.
Miss Deirdre Kivlin, 24, a catering assistant, spent much of her spare
time as a karaoke singer at clubs in the east of Edinburgh and pubs in
the city centre. She was known by the stage name The Voice.
She wore dark coloured clothes and had distinctive cropped hair with a
small tuft tied up in a knotted band.
A squad of 40 detectives and uniformed officers are attempting to
trace her last movements. She was reported missing by her mother six
weeks ago.
Detective Chief Inspector Ian Cowden said yesterday: ''This was a
shocking and very violent attack. We are now appealing to anyone who
might have seen Deirdre or been in her company since that time to
contact us immediately.''
''We feel that people will recognise Deirdre by her distinctive style
and appearance. She was a friendly and outgoing person who made a lot of
friends.''
Workmen called in by local residents who reported a stench, discovered
the body submerged in a drain beneath a manhole cover at the rear of
tenements in South Clerk Street.
The body was identified through dental records. It has not been
established if there was a sexual motive for the assault. The cause of
death has not been revealed but Miss Kivlin had been struck several
times on the head.
She was last seen by her mother, Mrs Ruth Kivlin, at the family home
in Greendykes Drive, Craigmillar, on July 8, apparently to collect keys
for a flat on the South Side. She telephoned her mother to say she would
not be back that night. When she failed to turn up the following day,
Mrs Kivlin contacted the police.
Officers at Craigmillar carried out a missing person inquiry,
interviewing friends and workmates. Police said everything suggested
Miss Kivlin was a cheerful young woman of good character.
Mr Cowden said it was not clear from the post-mortem examination when
Miss Kilvin died. ''We think it was three or four weeks ago but it could
have been longer.
''Whoever carried out this brutal crime is a very violent person and
needs to be caught. It might well be that the culprit would be heavily
bloodstained after the attack and might not have gone unnoticed,'' he
added.
Miss Kivlin worked for a small catering company Rolls on Wheels and
also helped prepare meals for Craigmillar Community Action Trust.
She also organised a number of fund-raising events in the area and had
taken part in Craigmillar Festival Society productions since her
childhood.
Her family were too upset to talk yesterday but family friend Margaret
Blair said: ''She was nice, kind girl. She loved singing and acting and
by the time she was four years old she had joined the festival society.
''She had a beautiful voice and really came out of herself on stage.
Everyone who knew she was missing was deeply worried about her because
Deirdre wasn't the type of girl to just go off without telling her mum.
No-one can believe what has happened.''

THE marsh o' Maybo, with its half-submerged fence posts, waving
grasses, and mysterious burnt mound, is a lonely and, since last summer,
a gey sinister place.
Within a few yards of Tommy's caravan, shielded from the Atlantic
blasts by a screen of concrete blocks, like some outpost on a forgotten
frontier, a foul murder was committed and the victim, horror of horrors,
was dumped in Tommy's bedroom.
A bit of background might be useful. Did you know that the corncrake,
once commonly found throughout Scotland, is one of 24 species of birds
listed as being of global conservation concern? In Scotland they are now
restricted to the western mainland, the Western Isles, and Orkney.
So anxious are the conservationists to halt the decline that farmers
are being offered grants to leave cutting of hay meadows until August
and to cut from the centre so that the birds are chased outwards to the
field edges. Nowadays, however, silage is cut early and often twice
yearly. In the past 25 years breeding males UK-wide have dwindled from
3000 to 488. (After the Slaying at the Maybo' Marsh you'd better make
that 487!)
The most timid of creatures, the corncrake arrives from Africa in the
spring and is rarely seen. Counting of males is done by identifying
their rasping two-syllable ''KREX-KREX'' -- think of a a comb being
grated over the striking surface of a matchbox.
I first heard the corncrake one still summer's evening when I was
showing an American journalist around the kirkyard of St Boniface, here
on Papa Westray. Suddenly out of the balmy evening, sounding out across
the fields from the direction of Kimbland, came the distinctive call.
Our US visitor had been all over Scotland and had never heard the
corncrake. It was a special shared moment.
Returning to more recent events. Throughout last year only 13 calling
birds were identified in Orkney. Last summer two birds were reported on
Papay and I heard at least one of them on my daily hikes. This chap
seemed to have settled in the rough grass between the farm of Skennist
and the boulder-strewn shore.
The corncrake in the marsh at Maybo' fell victim to Jack, Tommy's
black cat, who returned from his nightly patrol beside the reed beds
with a unique trophy.
Says Tommy: ''I wis sound asleep when the cat brought the bird up on
to the bed. I switched on the flashlight and I knew right away it was a
corncrake. It was a shame but the cat looked so proud o' himsel.
''It was smaller than I remembered. In my young days I saw them many a
time running in and out of the hay. At that time they just seemed to be
everywhere. Of course, in those days harvesting was done at a slower
pace and the birds got a chance to fly away. You'd sometimes see them
rising straight up at the last moment as the harvester reached them.''
Jack comes and goes through a broken window in Tommy's caravan and it
seems probably he heard the bird calling and went out on the prowl.
Cats aside, Tommy agrees that the old farming methods gave the bird a
far greater chance of survival: ''In those days on Papay we cut at least
a fortnight later -- well into July so that gave the birds a better
chance. It was quite a sight to see a line of chicks scooting along
after the mother bird.''
Another ''death by cat'' was also reported in Orkney and one feature
of the so-called Corncrake Initiative has been to offer little bells to
farmers to tie to the cat's collar, thus alerting the corncrake to the
feline presence. Jack, a bit of a traditionalist as well as an
adventurer, tells me he is not impressed.
Between the Wars, so the old-stagers on the island tell me, the
raucous chorus of the corncrake from May onwards was the herald of the
brief summer to come. Today it is the stench of slurry. A world changing
for the better. I wonder? We'll keep you posted on the corncrake count
as the summer progresses.

A SCOTTISH council is planning to lure Hollywood.
Following a string of films centred on Scotland, such as Rob Roy with
Liam Neeson and Mel Gibson's Braveheart, Dumbarton District Council
plans to get in on the act with the publication of its own screen
locations brochure.
It endeavours to portray some of the area's outstanding locations for
film and television, according to Councillor Sam McCallum, convener of
the council's leisure services committee.
In a multi-million pound film like Rob Roy, it was reckoned the
Scottish scenery not only boosted the movie's appeal but also the
tourist trade.
Local film-maker Andrew Macdonald, producer of Shallow Grave, is to
launch the brochure on Tuesday at Balloch Castle, overlooking Loch
Lomond.
The leisure services director, Mr John Beveridge, said: ''The district
has already played host to series like High Road and Dr Finlay.
''We want to build on that and are willing to help film-makers and
broadcasters coming to the area as much as we can.''
He said it was not just philanthropic interest, explaining that last
year Scotland ''enjoyed a record #22.9m in direct spending from the film
industry'' because of films such as Rob Roy and Braveheart, which will
have its British premiere next month in Stirling.
Scottish Screen Locations, set up to attract international film-makers
to Scotland, has agreed to distribute the publication at festivals and
conferences worldwide, including Cannes.

TORY Party headquarters says it made a clerical error resulting in Sir
Patrick McNair-Wilson's name appearing on a list of Conservative MPs who
had announced that they would be stepping down at the next election.
The list was provided to the media on Thursday.
Sir Patrick, 66, MP for New Forest, had a majority of 20,405 at the
last election.
He was not available for comment yesterday but his wife, Lady
McNair-Wilson, said: ''When the time comes for him to retire, he will
make a statement.''
A total of 41 Tory MPs have so far announced their intention to
retire.

A VIDEO of the Falkirk-Aberdeen match in May helped clear a Dons fan
in a court case yesterday. The Scottish Television film of the match was
viewed at Falkirk Sheriff Court.
The video was obtained by defence lawyer John Mulholland in a High
Court action in a bid to clear his client.
After watching a section of the film involving Falkirk star Brian Rice
about to take a corner, the prosecution scrapped the case.
Aberdeen supporter Peter Watson, 23, of Albyn Grove, Aberdeen, was
facing trial for an alleged breach of the peace at the match at
Brockville on May 13.
However, depute procurator- fiscal David Scott told Sheriff Albert
Sheehan: ''I have seen the video and I'm not satisfied that the
interests of justice would be best served by proceeding.''
As he left the court, Mr Watson, who was charged with a breach of the
peace by conducting himself in a disorderly manner, said: ''I've got
justice.''
Mr Mulholland, said: ''Mr Watson always denied committing any offence
and felt aggrieved at being singled out when he was totally innocent.''

<HEADLINE>Renewed criticism of Labour leader as he flies in for VJ Day celebrations Blair 'unlikely' to respond to attacks by left</HEADLINE>

MR Tony Blair is unlikely to take advantage of his brief return to
London this weekend for official VJ Day celebrations to answer two weeks
of attacks from the Labour left.
Although the Labour leader has been pressed to take up offers of
television and radio interviews to tell his critics he ''understands''
their fears but will not be deflected from his campaign to modernise the
party, a senior Labour official last night said it was ''unlikely''.
His staff insist he is unperturbed by the drip-drip of attacks on his
leadership, but they are keen to bring it to a halt before it undermines
his tight grip on dissent within the party.
Options are being kept open and the final decision is being left to Mr
Blair, who will prove his lack of concern by returning to his holiday as
soon as the commemorations of the end of the war are complete.
Yesterday Baroness Castle, a Labour Cabinet Minister in the sixties,
joined the queue of current and former MPs who accuse Mr Blair of
betraying Labour traditions, running the party like a Stalinist, and
shifting its policies too far to the right.
In a Daily Mail article she claimed that Mr Blair had failed to
address what she described as the widening gap between rich and poor
under the Tories, and she criticised New Labour's apparent willingness
to forget its radical history.
''There are legitimate fears that the advisers with whom he has
surrounded himself are urging him not to alarm anyone. They ignore the
fact that you cannot bring hope to the majority without frightening a
few vested interests,'' she said.
She also argued that Mr Blair's position was strong enough to
withstand criticism. ''The voicing of such demands would no doubt be
heralded by the media as further signs of a 'revolt' against Blair's
leadership.
''In fact, the party's loyalty to him is strong and healthy enough to
accommodate some frank discussions about policies. The time has come for
him to widen his circle of advice''.
However, she tempered her criticism with praise for his determination
to win the next election. ''You don't have to be power mad to want to
get rid of this Government. Some of his critics on the hard left suffer
from the reverse disease. They positively prefer the purity of
powerlessness of being in opposition,'' she said.
Meanwhile, the former Labour MP and front-bench spokesman Bryan Gould
has said he is considering suing the London Evening Standard for
publishing an article critical of Mr Blair earlier this week under his
name, which turned out to have been written by the son of Home Secretary
Michael Howard.
Mr Gould, a former libel lawyer, said he would decide whether to sue
the London newspaper for defamation after consulting his solicitors.
The Standard printed a front-page apology on Thursday, a day after
saying that as a result of a mix-up involving faxes, the article it
published was actually written by Nick Howard.
Mr Gould, now Vice Chancellor of Waikato University, New Zealand, said
he was concerned that the paper's original explanation for the error did
not hold water.
''I understand it is now clear that the initial explanation of the two
faxes arriving within minutes of each other doesn't really stand up. As
that is the case, I am still considering what to do.
''It's difficult to say whether this has arisen by sheer incompetence
or whether there is some conspiracy of some sort.
''Clearly there has been damage to my reputation and I have suffered
distress as a consequence of being attacked by friends.''

Paris, Friday
FRENCH police were today hunting a man seen pushing a package into a
litter bin just before the Paris bomb blast which injured a 60-year-old
British woman and 16 other people.
A passing cyclist said he helped police prepare a sketch of one of two
North African men whom he saw behaving suspiciously before the bomb went
off among a crowd of tourists near the Arc de Triomphe on Thursday.
Mrs Patricia Hudson of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was among eleven
tourists -- four Italians, four Hungarians, a Portuguese, and a German
-- injured in the blast just off the Champs Elysees.
Today Mrs Hudson was still being treated in hospital for shrapnel
wounds. She had been on a visit to her son, Dominic, 26, a teacher in
the capital.
Her friend and neighbour Mr Martin Harper, said he was shocked when he
heard Mrs Hudson was critically injured.
''I have since found out that her injuries are not as serious as first
believed,'' he said.
''It turns out she was walking away from the blast and hence it is
just injuries to her legs, although one may require plastic surgery.''
The blast aroused fears of a possible wave of attacks, coming just 23
days after a similar bomb at Saint Michel killed seven people and
wounded 86.
Today Paris police chief Philippe Massoni issued an appeal for
witnesses and said a one million franc reward offered after the first
bombing was also available for solving the latest.
More than 40 people volunteered information as police took away
hundreds of rubbish bins from tourist spots. Bins on the Metro had
already been bolted shut after the bomb in July.
Several holidaymakers handed in videotapes they had made in the area
just before the blast, but police said none enabled them to identify who
had planted the bomb, a gas canister packed with nails and bolts.
Interior minister Jean-Louis Debre, who cut short a holiday to return
to Paris and lead the investigation, called the attack ''cowardly,
criminal, and revolting'' and vowed to track down those responsible.
The government set up a crisis group to co-ordinate the investigation
and care for victims. Of the 17 injured, eight have been released from
hospital but three remained in a serious condition.

A YOUTH who formed part of a missile-throwing mob which attacked a car
after drinking Buckfast, cider, and lager at a gala day has lost a
#500,000 damages action.
Mr Richard Gilmour suffered severe brain damage when the car knocked
him down but a judge ruled yesterday that he was the author of his own
misfortune.
Lord Gill decided that car driver Brian Wynn was blameless for what
happened and said it was a matter of serious concern that he had been
kept locked up on a charge of attempted murder even after it was clear
the charge could not be justified.
Mr Gilmour was 19 when he was knocked down by Mr Wynn's Lada Samara in
Glenburn Avenue, Newarthill, Lanarkshire, about 9.45pm on Saturday, June
2, 1990.
He suffered permanent brain damage and will need constant care for the
rest of his life. His action at the Court of Session was raised on his
behalf by his mother, Mrs Sandra Gilmour, of Brannock Place, Newarthill.
Mrs Gilmour alleged that Mr Wynn, now 23, of Lime Loan, Holytown,
Lanarkshire, had been in the area to cause trouble with local youths and
had deliberately swerved his car towards Mr Gilmour.
Mr Wynn said he had found himself in Glenburn Avenue after taking a
wrong turning as he drove two friends home. He told the court his car
was attacked by a group of youths, including Mr Gilmour, who threw a
brick at the windscreen. Mr Wynn said he had been unable to avoid
hitting Mr Gilmour.
Issuing a written decision yesterday, Lord Gill said the case depended
critically on the credibility of eye-witnesses to the incident.
Mr Wynn and his two girl passengers impressed him as respectable and
truthful young people, on whose evidence he could rely. However, three
of Mr Gilmour's friends had given evidence on his behalf and none of
them was a satisfactory or wholly credible witness.
Lord Gill said: ''I do not believe them in their attempts to depict Mr
Wynn as the aggressor or Mr Gilmour as an innocent bystander.''
For some time before the incident, there had been rivalry between
youths from Newarthill and Holytown and that evening the Newarthill
youths had been expecting an ''incursion'' from Holytown.
Mr Gilmour had attended the Newarthill Gala that day. He and others
had been drinking Buckfast, cider, and lager and were affected by drink.
The judge added: ''When Mr Wynn arrived in Glenburn Avenue, word went
round the local youths that his was the car they had been expecting.
These youths, including Mr Gilmour, carried out their attack upon it.
''In my judgment, Mr Wynn was blameless. With assailants on either
side of him, he was forced to swerve from side to side as he tried to
make his way up Glenburn Avenue.
''It was obvious that the car was being driven under stress and that
Mr Wynn was not in full control. Even if Mr Gilmour had merely gone on
to the road for a better view of the proceedings, it would have been
foolhardy to stand where he did.
''But the evidence shows that he stood there in order to take part in
the attack. In acting as he did, he disregarded his own safety and, I
regret to say, was the author of his own misfortune.''
Lord Gill said Mr Wynn and his passengers had been subjected to a
frightening experience but worse was to follow for the car driver.
He drove straight to Bellshill to report the incident to police.
Investigating officers were told by local youths that Mr Wynn had driven
deliberately at Mr Gilmour.
On the strength of that, he was charged with attempted murder and
locked up in a cell late on the Saturday night.
By the middle of Sunday, however, it was clear the charge of attempted
murder could no longer be sustained.
''Despite that, Mr Wynn was detained in custody until the Monday
morning, when he was released without any court appearance,'' said Lord
Gill.
''I regard the continued detention of Mr Wynn for that period as a
matter of serious concern which the Chief Constable might wish to
consider.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said later: ''Lord Gill's comments
have been taken on board by us and are being looked at just now.''
Last night, Richard Gilmour's mother, Sandra, 43, was ''very upset,
annoyed, and angry'' about the decision.
She said her son now 25, had been out with friends on the day of the
accident and described him as ''a responsible young man whose life has
been taken away''.
Mrs Gilmour added: ''It was the gala day, really warm and everyone was
enjoying themselves. It wasn't a thing where they were all out drinking
and looking for trouble. There was no gang warfare.
''The money would have been his future. He has nothing now.''

Going down: One of Edinburgh's most famous landmarks, the 68-year-old
Niddrie Brickworks chimneys, comes crashing to earth. The chimneys are
making way for a retail park. Workers used jack hammers to bore the base
of the 120ft chimneys, ''felling them like trees'', according to a
spokesman for the demolition company.
The first came down at midday, the second, three hours later.
Looking on were residents who have been used to seeing the landmark on
their horizon for generations.
They included Mr Jimmy Ross from Niddrie, who helped make the first
bricks there when he was a 17 year-old.
Local councillor Paul Nolan said: ''It is sad to see an old industrial
site die but new jobs have to be created and this has to be good for the
area, and Edinburgh.''

<HEADLINE>Valuation case victory for shooting lodge Judges rule house is not liable for rates</HEADLINE>

THE owner of a large Victorian shooting lodge in the Highlands which
is rented out for #2000 a week in the summer has won a legal victory
which could benefit other holiday homes.
The Lands Valuation Appeal Court has ruled that Conaglen House,
Ardgour, Fort William, which has been renovated at a cost of #800,000,
should not be liable for rates because it is still a dwelling house
rather than business premises.
Lord Milligan, one of the judges dealing with the case, said: ''We are
told that there may be many other potential cases arising along the
lines of the present one, namely where holiday houses are partly used
for private purposes and partly for commercial letting.
''In the present case, the house concerned happens to be very
substantial but the point raised could arise in relation to holiday
houses of all sizes and values.''
Lord Clyde said Mr John Guthrie, the owner of Conaglen House, normally
lived in North Yorkshire and had been gifted the home by his father in
1962.
The father had acquired the lodge in 1959 and the family had used it
for holidays since then.
Between late April and early May and October, the house could be let
out and the assessor had entered the house on the valuation roll with a
net annual value of #4500.
Mr Guthrie argued that the lodge should be excluded from the roll,
since it was domestic rather than commercial. The local valuation appeal
committee agreed with the assessor and Mr Guthrie took the case to the
valuation appeal court.
Lord Clyde said the question was whether Conaglen House should or
should not be classified as a dwelling house and the critical issue was
the different uses that were made of the home -- part residential and
part commercial.
It was clear that in layout and appearance Conaglen was a dwelling
house. It had no public reception area as would be found in a typical
hotel or public guest house.
Lord Clyde added: ''The subjects are described generally as a large
Victorian shooting lodge. Substantial refurbishment and alterations were
carried out between November 1990 and March 1992 at a cost of about
#800,000, partly at least to eradicate rot.
''It was during this work that the assessor discovered that the
subjects were let for a substantial part of each year, and entered them
in the roll.''
The rent for Conaglen House was between #1800 and #2000 a week, which
included services such as cooking, cleaning, and baby-sitting, and the
local committee described this as ''a very substantial commercial use''.
Lord Clyde said the committee had plainly been impressed by the
commercial use of the property but he felt it had adopted too narrow an
approach.
The fact that someone let out his house in return for a rent for
periods of the year did not necessarily mean that it stopped being a
dwelling house for the purposes of valuation law.
Between autumn and spring, Mr Guthrie and his family made use of the
house. They spent Christmas there; Mr Guthrie's son, while at
university, spent one weekend a month there and his daughter made
occasional visits.
There was a full-time housekeeper who tended the house throughout the
year for the family and tenants.
Lord Clyde said the facts did not support the conclusion that there
was a predominant commercial use.
''One starts with the solid fact that the subjects are physically a
dwelling house, together with the fact that they are used solely for
residential purposes. They do not possess the physical characteristics
of a hotel or a public guest house.
''In the circumstances, there would have to be some clear and
compelling evidence to establish that the subjects are business premises
before the considerations of the physical appearance and the actual
private domestic use made of them can be discarded and their entry in
the roll affirmed as correct.''
Lords Milligan and Cameron agreed that the house should be deleted
from the valuation roll.
* It is understood that by paying council tax instead of rates for
Conaglen House, Mr Guthrie will save about #1200 to #1300 a year.

BBC Radio 2 presenter Alan Dell died yesterday, aged 65, after a long
battle against cancer.
The Cape Town-born dance-band and big-band expert worked in radio for
more than 40 years, starting with the South African Broadcasting
Corporation before joining the BBC in the early 1950s.
Since 1973, his Monday evening shows, Dance Band Days and Big Band
Era, have become a fixture on Radio 2. He also presented Sounds Easy on
Sunday afternoons.
Radio 2 controller Frances Line said: ''Alan's was one of the
best-loved voices on radio. He'll be greatly missed, not only by friends
and colleagues but by millions of listeners.''
Mr Dell leaves a widow, Annie, and three children.

A VISION of the South Side of Glasgow with communities partitioned by
motorways was presented yesterday at the launch of the No M74 campaign.
At a news conference in Govanhill, near the path of a proposed slip
road, the campaigners urged a reopening of the road's planning
consultation phase and a public inquiry.
The M74 extension, due for completion in 2002, will connect the A74
with the M8 at the Kingston Bridge and be built on stilts across
Rutherglen, Govanhill, and Cambuslang.
Campaign organiser Rosie Kane said: ''The consultation exercise has
been so inadequate as to be effectively non-existent. The people on the
streets know nothing about this motorway. The road may provide some
short-term economic advantages but we are the ones who have to live here
for a long time.''
The No M74 group called for a public meeting next Friday with
representatives of ''the Bermuda triangle of decision-making'', the
Scottish Labour Party, Strathclyde region, and the city council.

A TOP-SECRET operation has been mounted to protect the identity of
this year's ''surprise'' premiere at the Drambuie Edinburgh Film
Festival.
The screening at the Cameo Cinema next Saturday has been a sell-out
amid rumours it would be Four Rooms, the latest movie involving Quentin
Tarantino.
Tarantino's acclaimed black comedy Pulp Fiction, starring John
Travolta and Bruce Willis, was the showpiece surprise of the 1994
festival, which was widely known among moviegoers before the screening.
The speculation this year has been fuelled by a magazine article
quoting Alison Anders, one of four directors involved in the movie, who
was quoted as saying the film would open in Edinburgh.
However, a spokesman for the film festival last night denied it was
Four Rooms, ''but the interest is such that it has completely sold out.
''I haven't a clue what the film will be. No-one does except our
director Mark Cousins.''
Such is the level of secrecy over the identity of the film, that the
print of the movie will be delivered directly to Mr Cousins's home at
the end of the week.
He will deliver it to the Cameo for the 7pm debut, sharing its title
only with the projectionist before the opening titles.
* Actress Diane Ladd called for The Filmhouse to be exorcised after an
ornamental bubble tank exploded, scattering glass and water over the bar
and restaurant of the revamped cinema.
She claimed to feel a presence at the converted church, where there
have been reports of ''spectral breathing''. Staff believe The Filmhouse
is haunted by the spirit of the wife of a Victorian minister.
A Film Festival spokesman said: ''The scientific explanation is that
the heat caused a joist to expand against the glass, which cracked
slightly, causing the pressure which broke it, but Miss Ladd has said we
need a spiritualist.''
Both tanks, which had been installed for the festival, have now been
removed.
* Work by modern Danish artists at the festival paint such a gloomy
view of life that even staff at the City Art Centre, in Market Street,
where the pictures are on show, say they are being affected adversely.
The massive sludge-coloured paintings include a composition of tiny
human foetuses attached to each other by their umbilical cords and a
hideously mutated creature squatting on all fours.

THE #25m first phase of a plan to rebuild Victoria Infirmary in
Glasgow over a period of 15 years received the starting signal
yesterday.
The city's councillors agreed -- for a token #1 fee -- to turn
adjacent playing fields over to the Victoria Infirmary NHS Trust. Queens
Park recreation grounds extend to 24 acres across the road from the main
hospital building.
Only four acres are involved in the initial takeover. However, a
report before the building and property committee said: ''The trust are
examining a number of options -- but favour the provision of a 750-bed
new-build hospital located on the recreation ground site.''
The trust's chief executive, Mr J B Small, promised the council that,
with its support, the first phase would start within two years.
The infirmary was established on its present site in the city's south
side in 1890. The ground was made available on preferential terms by the
former Glasgow Corporation. The infirmary now provides for a population
of 220,000 in its catchment area and covers about nine acres.
The trust is comprised of three sections -- the infirmary, with 485
acute beds; the geriatric unit, with 256 geriatric assessment beds; and
Rutherglen Maternity, with 56 obstetric beds. It deals each year with
30,000 in-patients, 270,000 outpatients, 9000 day cases, and 72,000
accident and emergency cases. The number of patients is expected to
continue to rise.
At present, the hospital employs 1488 full-time staff and 1059
part-time staff. However, its future development always faced the
problem of its island site, with roads on all sides.
The trust's professional advisers were anxious to secure the
hospital's future on the playing fields site, lying to the east.
A 10 to 15-year development programme will see the hospital in effect
being totally rebuilt. The first phase would provide a new psychiatric
block containing 130 beds, to offset the closure of the existing unit at
Leverndale and a new day/outpatient block to replace the existing
facility within the infirmary building.

A SEARCH was launched yesterday for Scotland's missing movie heritage,
including the first screen version of Rob Roy and Sir Harry Lauder's
debut as a serious actor.
The original Rob Roy, a 1911 silent blockbuster, tops a wanted list of
eight movies featuring Scottish acting, writing, and musical talent
which the Scottish Film Archive wants to trace for next year's centenary
of cinema.
Archive curator Janet McBain issued an appeal for help in finding the
lost celluloid, which includes a 1927 Anglo-American silent movie,
Huntingtower, from the John Buchan novel, starring Sir Harry Lauder in
his first serious acting role.
Others include The Little Singer, made from a tiny film studio behind
the Saracen's Head pub in Glasgow 30 years ago, and silent movies The
Harp King, The Life of Robert Burns, The Life of Sir Walter Scott, and
Fitba' Daft. Also sought is the more recent 1946 short Someone Wasn't
Thinking, starring Gordon Jackson.
Announcing the appeal, Lost But Not Forgotten, at the Drambuie
Edinburgh Film Festival, Ms McBain said that any film uncovered would be
restored and copied for a gala screening during next year's festival.
'It's a race against time,'' she said. ''The films' original nitrate
will be starting to disintegrate.''
The archive also announced it was publishing its first catalogue of
20,000 Scottish films.

GRACE FRANKLIN meets Isle of Arran weavers whose combined work will
show world women what can be achieved by working together.
THE unique work of weavers on the Isle of Arran has been sent on its
way to China. The metre-square tapestry will be seen by an estimated
40,000 people attending the United Nations Fourth World Conference on
Women being held in Beijing in September.
As both a work of art and a political statement, it will illustrate
the fact that women on this Scottish island share concerns with women
around the world on issues affecting them all.
The tapestry will be one of hundreds created by women from all the
countries represented at the United Nations and sewn together in Beijing
as a celebration of sharing.
The project was inspired by Lynn Ross, a professional weaver.
Ross learned how to spin, dye and weave when she lived in Sweden.
Kilmarnock born, she had lived abroad from early childhood when her
parents emigrated. On a holiday visit to Scotland in the April of 1975
she visited Arran for the first time.
The place had such an impact, she was back on the island by November.
With her six-year-old daughter Jill in tow, she sold, within a week, a
suitcase full of wool samples she'd brought with her. ''I decided there
was a future for me on Arran,'' says Ross.
It took a long time to persuade the various authorities that her
scheme to teach weaving, spinning and dyeing skills was wonderful, not
woolly.
Eventually she got a grant to build a weaving studio. With time out to
marry, have two more children, get divorced, and take a University
course, she found that her skills sustained her.
''There was a need for someone to teach these skills and the Senior
Studies Institute at Strathclyde University, along with the Community
Education Department of Strathclyde Region, recognised that need,'' she
explains.
So funding was found to start a 50-Plus Programme and a 3rd Age
Challenge Programme to give older people the opportunity to develop
their skills or learn new ones. An Arran Weaving Project was started to
research the traditional textiles of Arran and to use those designs to
promote educational opportunities to bring people of different
generations together to work.
Spinners and weavers now regularly demonstrate their skills in the
Heritage Museum, Brodick, and in schools, among other places.
One of these demonstrations impressed Dot Winters who had retired to
the island with her husband Alfred after holidaying there for 35 years.
''We were interested in crafts, that was one of the reasons we came here
to live,'' says Winters who was one-time Mayor of Southwark in London.
When Alfred died, Winters went to one of Ross's weaving classes. ''I
found it very therapeutic. I was always learning something about the
colours and got the feel for weaving. It was also a chance to meet other
ladies. This all helped me through my grieving.''
Margaret Fitzpatrick doesn't drive. She met her friend Norma Muston on
the bus. ''She had a spinning wheel with her and would be going to the
over-50s class at the High School,'' recollects Fitzpatrick. ''At that
time I was busy looking after my granddaughter. When I was able to have
time to myself I joined the weaving class. I haven't looked back
since.'' ''I used to be the quiet one, now I've progressed to becoming
the Weavers' Group delegate to conferences and made my first public
speech in Dublin at a preparatory meeting for the Beijing conference,''
Fitzpatrick says.
The Dublin event was run by the European Older Women's Network to
prepare their arguments which they hope will influence the document
produced in Beijing. That document will be a global blueprint for women,
which governments will have drafted and agreed so should be duty bound
to implement.
Issues common to women and of particular concern to older women are
highlighted on an island like Arran.
Former physics teacher Margaret Shotter had time on her hands when she
retired. ''I wanted to do something and had always been interested in
crafts. But I'd only lived on the island a year and didn't know what was
available,'' she says.
She saw the weaving class advertised in the local Arran Banner
newspaper and turned up at the following Thursday afternoon session.
''Now having used natural wool in these classes, I'll never use
synthetic fibres again,'' Shotter says. But it can mean spending as much
as 15 hours dyeing wool to the particular shade required.
The Beijing tapestry, which the women have created, depicts the island
of Arran. Using an Ordnance Survey map as the pattern basis, the women
spun wool specially dyed with local plants and wove their impression of
the island. The image created is like a thermal photograph.
Some of the wool is from local sheep. Housewife Norma Muston supplied
it. ''When I first came to Arran 13 years ago I was given a sheep. I
thought it was for the freezer but it was a live sheep. You need friends
around you to know how to cope with a situation like that! I couldn't
kill it and eventually got the wool for spinning.
''I was the one who took my spinning wheel onto the bus to go to
Lynn's classes. It's a lot easier to carry than the weaving frame,''
Muston says.
''There is a message here,'' says Ross. ''There are all kinds of
reasons why women support each other. You find it in a community like
ours when we face grief or loss, or have to cope with what life throws
at us. And you find it around the world. Women who stick together can
achieve great things maybe, even, peace. We have woven this tapestry
which will be sewn to hundreds of others, to show how our lives on Arran
are bound together with women worldwide.''

Alison Kerr takes to the street with Fringe and Festival fans and
discovers that this year's fashion motto is 'anything goes'.
THEY come in all shapes and sizes; all ages and from everywhere in the
world to experience the madness of Edinburgh's Festival and Fringe. They
also come in evey imaginable style of outfit: from the sublime to the
ridiculous. Anyone who has lost their Fringe virginity will have long
since become immune to the shock-value that publicity-seeking performers
hope to turn into bums-on-seats. Even Julian Clary, the prince of pink
Lycra who single-handedly converted cycling shorts into evening wear, is
rumoured to be abandoning ''outrageous'' costumes in favour of a nice
grey suit.
Considerably more interesting to observe are the fashions being
paraded by the Fringe trekkies, those folk who have taken their holidays
to boldly travel where they would not go the rest of the year -- to
sweaty studenty venues which are all within difficult hiking distance
from each other. Understandably, for many, the priority when selecting
their Fringe wardrobe is comfort; hence the proliferation of
comfortable, flat shoes on the pavements of Edinburgh. For others, being
noticed is the name of the game -- not an easy thing when you're
competing with professional show-offs from around the globe.
There is no discernible Fringe style. But there are trends. This year,
the visitor to Edinburgh would be forgiven for wondering if there was
some kind of medieval fashion revival going on: take a glance around any
public gathering over the next two weeks, and you will almost certainly
notice some very peculiar hats bobbing around.
Oversized, two-toned hats in a variety of styles and colours are
selling at a rate of hotcakes from a pitch on the Mound where a company
called Himalayan High has set up makeshift shop. Handmade in Nepal and
costing #10, these unlikely items of headgear are disappearing so fast
that the London couple selling them is worried about being able to match
the demand. The most popular models -- or the ones which stand out the
most -- appear to be those in the style of a traditional jester's hat
(with three points), and the distorted top hat-shaped ones, as worn by
Dr Zeuss's Cat in a Hat character.
Hats aside, it's really a case of each to his/her own. And the message
from the Fringe fashion front would appear to be: anything goes.

<HEADLINE>Motorola seeks 400 warriors for weekend work</HEADLINE>

FOUR hundred jobs are to be created at the Motorola cellular telephone
plant at Bathgate, West Lothian, over the next year.
Many of the jobs are for workers dubbed ''weekend warriors'' and will
secure Motorola's position as Scotland's largest manufacturing employer.
Mr John Palle, the company's vice-president made the announcement as
he received the Queen's Award for Export Achievement on behalf of the
company from the The Earl of Morton.
Motorola currently has 2600 workers at its Bathgate factory which
opened three years ago and which provides cellular telephones to more
than 60 countries across the world.
Elsewhere in Scotland, the company has two silicon chip factories, one
at South Queensferry, which provides 500 jobs, the other at East
Kilbride, which has 2400 workers.
A company spokesman said last night that some of the jobs at the
Bathgate factory would go to people unable to work five days a week but
who could work around 32 hours over a weekend.
The spokesman said: ''Many people who want to work with hi-tech firms,
people with young children, are unable to put in a five-day working
week. Many of these new jobs for posts like production-line workers will
be for these sort of people which are being called weekend warriors.''
Motorola believes the world-wide market for mobile phones, currently
standing at around 60 million subscribers, will quadruple over the next
10 years.
Mr Palle praised the existing workforce at Bathgate and said that
Scotland and Motorola were now synonymous with success.
''We are now shipping cellular telephones from Easter Inch in Bathgate
to more than 60 countries across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East and
to others such as China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Australasia,'' said Mr
Palle.
He said the Queen's Award For Export Achievement reflected the
sustained growth in worldwide sales and its position as market leader.
* Bicycle maker Raleigh Industries is shedding 200 jobs by the end of
the year, it was announced yesterday.
The company, which employs 1000 people, also announced it was
launching a #6m restructuring of its Nottingham plant to enable it to
maintain its market position against fierce competition from overseas
markets.
''Of 11 million cycles sold in Britain in the last five years, eight
million came from the Far East,'' said company spokesman Michael
Breckon.
The regeneration programme will be part-funded by the sale of some of
its office land to Nottingham University, resulting in the closure of
part of the current Raleigh site.

Liz Taylor discovers that where cycling paraphernalia is concerned
what goes around comes around
One machine was so successful that the owner was fined for ''furious
driving''
IF YOU are taking Mr Tebbit's advice and getting on your bike, make
sure that it's an old one, for antique bicycles are the latest
fashionable thing to collect.
Next Saturday will see bicyclists converging on Edinburgh where
Phillips are holding the first sale in Scotland of Cycles and Cycling
Ephemera.
They will have 75 lots to pick from as well as another 25 odd bits and
pieces comprising posters, jewellery, silver bicycling trophies, clocks,
board games, a cycling cartoon by Cecil Aldin, bicycle oil lamps,
advertising signs, and books.
Among this miscellaneous section there is a brooch in the shape of an
1890s lady's safety bicycle in 14-carat gold which is so painstakingly
accurate that even the wire spokes and the brake nuts can be seen, which
is amazing considering that the brooch is only one-and-a-half inches
long. It is expected to sell for around #300, which is more than a real
1890s safety bicycle would fetch today.
Other interesting bicycling artefacts are two nineteenth-century
French clocks, one surmounted by the gilt figure of a cyclist and his
bike, and the other with its face in the shape of a bicycle wheel. They
are expected to fetch prices between #600 and #800 each.
The bulk of the sale, however, is made up of bicycles and the range
and variety of them gives an idea of what an innovation they must have
been when they first appeared. The history of the bicycle documents
man's continuing efforts to conquer time and space. Before they came
along, the fastest moving means of transport was the horse.
The origin of the bicycle is unclear. There is said to be a medieval
stained-glass window in a church at Stoke Poges showing a figure seated
on a sort of bicycle and pushing it along with his feet. That must have
been the very first case of getting on your bike.
The history of bicycling as we know it, however, started in France in
1779 when two men named Blanchard and Magurier invented a four-wheeled
machine which they called the velocipede. This too was propelled by the
rider running along the ground and it was exhibited at the court of
Marie Antoinette but history overtook the invention and nothing more is
heard of bicycle riding till about 1816, when, again in Paris, a sort of
hobby horse called the ''celeripede'', was invented by a M Niepice. Once
more the rider did all the work.
In 1817, an improvement was devised in Germany where a sort of
up-market skateboard, called a walking accelerator or a running machine,
made its appearance. It had only two wheels, a bar on which the rider
stood and a steering apparatus. Again the rider's feet did most of the
work but the two-wheeled machine was faster and more manoeuvrable than
previous ones.
Then, in the 1830s, an inventive Scottish blacksmith called
Kirkpatrick McMillan of Dumfries was the first person to incorporate a
drive mechanism on to the walking accelerator. His machine was so
successful that he was prosecuted and fined for ''furious driving'' on
the roads. In 1846 another Scot called Gavin Dalzell improved McMillan's
design and between them those two men share the title of being inventors
of the bicycle.
After that bicycle design really took off, especially in France. In
the 1860s one of the most popular machines was a ''bone-shaker'' by a
French manufacturer called Michaux. There is one of these machines in
Phillips' sale. Though it is missing its footrest, the price is expected
to go above #2000.
The organiser of Phillips' sale, Nicholas Oddy, is an Edinburgh
academic with a passion for old bikes. He started collecting them in his
teens and now has more than 40. His particular interest lies in bicycles
made between 1895 and 1925, when bicycle manufacturing was in full swing
at Coventry, but some of the more unusual bikes in his sale pre-date
that period.
The earliest example in the sale is a pre-McMillan 1820s hobby horse
which is estimated at around #1000. More rideable without wearing out
shoe leather are two front-driven penny-farthing bicycles of the
mid-1880s. One is a ''Kangaroo'' model which has gearing on the front
wheel, and the other is a rare machine called the ''Facile''. Both of
them are estimated at between #3000 and #5000.
Another interesting penny-farthing bicycle, which is in excellent
condition, is likely to attract collectors' attention because it still
has a full set of brakes. Because riders were liable to be pitched over
the handlebars if they applied their brakes, they usually removed them.
They also didn't want to bother about brakes because the aim of
bicyclists then was speed and to use brakes was considered to be
''chicken''.
Perhaps the most unusual bicycle in the sale is a 1901 Singer which is
reputed to have been made for George Bernard Shaw, a keen bicyclist, and
Member Number 621 of the Cyclists' Touring Club, an organisation that
once had more prestige than the AA.
Because Shaw was so tall, his bike was specially made with a double
cross-bar to bear his weight. Although Shaw's ownership of the bicyle is
only by repute, there is a leather tool pouch with his initials on it
attached to the saddle and that adds authenticity. Because the bicycle
is so rare, Phillips have not put a price on it and are simply waiting
to see how high it goes.
* Readers will recall mention being made of an ivory figure of
Benjamin Franklin which was bought in a box of junk for #1 at Kelso
racecourse car-boot sale. Last month it was put up for sale at Phillips
in Glasgow with an estimate of #800, which seemed amazing enough. In the
event it sold for an astonishing #3200.

Dubrovnik, Friday,
ARTILLERY thundered in the hills above Dubrovnik today after the
United Nations said Croatia had deployed up to 10,000 troops for an
assault on Bosnian Serb positions overlooking the Adriatic port.
Reporters were prevented by soldiers from getting close to the battle
inland from the historic port but could hear sporadic explosions in the
barren hills east of Dubrovnik.
The UN peacekeeping mission said tensions were high in the area
following Zagreb's warning that it would take military action to push
Serb guns out of range of the picturesque city.
Despite a reported build-up of Croatian troops, President Franjo
Tudjman said he wanted no further war with rebel Serbs.
Tudjman told a news conference in Zagreb he favoured resolving
Dubrovnik's plight and the last remaining Serb-held enclave of Eastern
Slavonia by negotiations.
Asked how long Zagreb would put up with Serb shelling of the Dubrovnik
area, Tudjman said: ''We will put up with it until we run out of
patience, once all our peace efforts prove futile.''
He declined to say when that might be.
''It depends,'' Tudjman said cryptically. ''If it can't be done
peacefully, with help from international factors then we will take
necessary steps,'' the 73-year-old former army general said.
A doubling of Croatian troops in the area since Thursday lent credence
to UN suggestions that a Croatian offensive could be just days away.
''There may be as many as 10,000 Croatian soldiers in the area
northeast of the city,'' said UN spokesman Chris Gunness. ''The
situation is extremely tense.''
Croatia has been riding high since it routed Serb rebels in the
Krajina region two weeks ago, reintegrating about a fifth of its
territory into the country.
A new Croatian offensive would be aimed at sweeping Bosnian Serb
gunners from hilltop strongholds from which they can bombard Dubrovnik.
Serbs laid siege to the once-popular tourist port in 1991, blasting its
picturesque old town.
While the threat of war loomed over Dubrovnik, the United States
pressed on with an initiative which would trade land for peace in Bosnia
and threaten military action for those who do not fall in line.
US envoy Richard Holbrooke met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
for a second day in Belgrade and later returned to Zagreb for more talks
with Tudjman.
Holrbooke appeared to have won Milosevic's support for the plan to end
four years of war in ex-Yugoslavia, and Tudjman praised the latest
proposals as well.
Holbrooke planned to travel to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo for his
first meeting with President Alija Izetbegovic.
* A 13-year-old girl was killed and at least 14 other people wounded
yesterday when a shell crashed down near a bus carrying electricity
workers and their families back to their homes in Sarajevo.
''All of a sudden there was an explosion and people started
screaming,'' said bus driver Farud Gacanovic.
''I was conscious enough to hide the bus behind a building and people
who were able to get out ran away immediately. Then I drove the bus to
the Dobrinja hospital with all the dead and wounded.''
The dead girl, Amra Banja, lay in a city mortuary while her mother and
father were being treated in hospital for injuries suffered in the same
incident.

THE vulnerability of the nationalist Serbs has caught Western
diplomats and politicians on the hop. Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for the
Western Isles, argues that although there are no purely good sides in
any war, the West should not be afraid of intervening to make sure that
the better wins and not the worse.
IT is tempting to turn to another TV channel when faced with more
pictures of fleeing refugees and bombarded towns in the Balkans.
Yet it is a mistake to see the fighting as just another episode in an
apparently endless cycle of violence.
The recent, swift recapture of the Krajina region of Croatia by
government forces was without precedent and the first significant
reversal for the nationalist Serbs who, until now, have had things all
their own way.
It demonstrated that the defeat of Serbian nationalism need not
involve a long, drawn-out war of attrition. Once parity of arms is
achieved, defeat for the nationalist Serbs can come devastatingly
quickly.
This revelation is highly significant because until now it was assumed
by Western diplomats that the nationalist Serbs were unbeatable and that
the only realistic policy was to limit the fighting, accept Serb gains,
and broker a carve-up of Bosnia -- even though that was in evident
conflict with UN resolutions affirming the integrity and unity of Bosnia
and calling for the return of refugees.
This view was held by the then British Foreign Minister, Mr Douglas
Hogg, who is quoted in Mark Almond's book, Europe's Backyard War, as
saying of the Bosnians: ''They have got to recognise military defeat
when it stares them in the face . . . land has been seized by force and
there is going to have to be acquiescence in that.''
To the frustration of the Foreign Office, however, neither the Croats
nor the Bosnians have meekly accepted the submissive roles allotted to
them.
They have defied the hopelessness of their position and the Croatian
government has now achieved by force what four sorry years of diplomatic
appeasement by the West could not deliver.
There can be no doubt about the legal and political right of the
Croatian government to retake Krajina. It is an internationally
recognised part of their country.
The nationalist Serbs who seized power in the region four years ago
represented a minority even of the Serb population within Croatia. They
created an artificial Serb majority only by ruthless ethnic cleansing.
Since then, they have consistently rejected every agreement proposed by
the international community to resolve their status.
Nor did the nationalist Serbs lapse into harmless passivity after
their original seizure of power in the Krajina.
On the contrary, their forces played the decisive role in maintaining
the remorseless siege of Bihac in neighbouring Bosnia. Their most recent
attack upon Bihac took place just last month.
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Bosnian Government has
co-ordinated willingly with Croatian forces. Western criticism of the
Croats and calls for further negotiations have been met with
understandably hollow laughter from Zagreb to Sarajevo.
What the Croatian Government cannot ignore, however, is international
condemnation of any systematic atrocities carried out by its troops or
of deliberate ethnic cleansing.
Such abuses have been the key question throughout the Balkans crisis.
It was not their demands for autonomy that forfeited international
sympathy for the nationalist Serbs but the way they went about it.
By employing mass rape, terror, and forcible expulsion of civilians to
achieve their goal of ethnically pure Serbian territories, they placed
themselves beyond the pale of international tolerance.
These methods were on display again last month in Srebrenica, where
thousands of Muslims are still missing, reportedly executed en masse.
If the Croatian Government and army engage in similar barbarism, they
too must be condemned as war criminals. On the evidence so far, however,
it is too early to make that judgment.
The flood of refugees is not itself evidence of ethnic cleansing. The
real issue is whether people were pressured into leaving or are being
denied the right to return.
The Croatian Government continues to insist that the ordinary Serb
population, barring ''war criminals'', can return and, indeed, the
current exodus seems wholly organised by the nationalist Serb leadership
itself.
It is to the UN's discredit that they facilitated the exodus rather
than sought to halt it.
Similarly, the UN special negotiator, Carl Bildt, was premature to
compare the Croat bombardment of Knin with the nationalist Serb
rocketing of Zagreb earlier this year.
Tragically, the use of military force always entails death and injury,
civilian as well as military. Nevertheless, there is a world of
difference between civilian casualties incurred in pursuit of a clearly
military objective and the deliberate targeting of civilians for
terrorist effect.
The rocketing of Zagreb, like the shelling of Dubrovnik or the
systematic levelling of Vukovar, are examples of pure terrorism and
wanton destruction.
The bombardment of Knin, preparatory to its capture by infantry 24
hours later, looks no more a war crime than the allied bombardment of
Baghdad during the Gulf war.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo was at his most fatuous in accusing
the Croats of being as guilty of war crimes as the Serbs.
Of course, there are no purely good sides in any war. Even in the
Second World War, perhaps the paradigm of a clear black-and-white
conflict, the Allies committed excesses in bombing German cities and we
treasured Stalin as an ally although he makes President Tudjman look
like a saint.
However, the fact that there is no pure good or bad side in a deadly
and vicious conflict doesn't exclude there being a better and a worse.
We should not be afraid of intervening to make sure that the better wins
and not the worse.
What is deeply alarming is that Portillo as Defence Secretary retains
as his personal political adviser a certain David Hart who became
infamous as Mrs Thatcher's Svengali during the miners' strike and who
wrote in the Spectator in January 1993 that ''Britain's national
interest would be best served by helping the Serbs'' because ''a strong
Orthodox Serbia would undoubtedly act as a bulwark against any Islamic
incursion into Western Europe''.
Of course, we cannot be complacent about what might still happen in
Krajina.
Croat irregulars have been guilty of some of the worst abuses of the
war in Bosnia. It is also clear that there is a political struggle in
Croatia between the hard-line nationalists and the more
Western-orientated politicians. President Tudjman's own politics are
crudely nationalist and authoritarian.
The hard-line nationalists are doubtless delighted that the Serbs fled
Krajina. However, many in Croatia still favour a multi-ethnic state of
the kind that existed before the war when 600,000 Serbs lived in Croatia
and a third of marriages were mixed.
The international community should put irresistible pressure upon the
Croatian Government to ensure that ordinary Serb refugees have a right
to return, that Serbian property and Orthodox churches are not
systematically destroyed (the nationalist Serbs razed around 200
Catholic churches in Krajina during their reign of terror), and that
tight discipline is maintained on the Croatian troops.
Britain, meanwhile, together with the other countries of the EU, has
more than a humanitarian interest in this war. We have real political
interests at stake as well.
The nationalist Serbs are trying to create an apartheid political
order based on ethnic purity. They employ the most barbaric violence to
achieve this. Both their methods and their objectives are profoundly
hostile to the principles of liberalism and democracy upon which
Europe's peace and prosperity have been founded since 1945.
True, there is no oil in the Balkans but political communities are
more than just a network of selfish economic ties. We are held together
by values and principles which we should champion and defend as robustly
as we do our economic interests.
Sadly, Western leaders are now pushing a deal openly described by
France's defence minister as a ''carve-up''. The deal will partition
Bosnia, handing to the butchers of Srebrenica not just that town but
Zepa, and even Gorazde.
The moral degeneracy of this deal-making is breathtaking, as is its
consistent failure to grasp the true dynamics of the Balkans.
Such a deal will never lead to peace for it cannot be accepted by the
Bosnians, particularly now that they have seen what can be achieved by
parity of arms.
They will not rest until the embargo against them has been lifted or
subverted, and the nationalist Serbs either willingly reintegrated into
Bosnia or else militarily defeated. The Croats likewise won't relinquish
their claim to Eastern Slavonia and neither will the Albanians in Kosovo
accept the forced resettlement of 20,000 Serb refugees in their midst.
There is an alternative but that involves holding fast to all the UN
resolutions condemning ethnic cleansing and territorial changes won by
force.
The nationalist Serbs should be utterly isolated within Bosnia and
sanctions continued against Milosevic's Serbia. Any attack upon the
remaining safe areas should be met, as promised, by a widespread and
comprehensive bombing campaign to destroy the heavy weapons, military
supplies, and communications networks of the nationalist Serbs.
We should also support and assist the Bosnian Government, using the
numerically superior and highly motivated army, to establish control
over the whole of Bosnia.
Finally, the West should prepare immediately a detailed aid and
reconstruction programme to facilitate the return of refugees in both
Bosnia and Croatia, and to rebuild civil society along democratic and
multi-ethnic lines.
Such a policy, combining principle with genuine realism, has been
completely missing until now. However, if the Government were to devote
a fraction of the effort to this that they have put into planning
UNPROFOR'S withdrawal, then at least our troops would finally know what
they are risking their lives for.

Don't be hampered by a whole load of complicated picnic recipes, says
Lady Claire Macdonald
SEVERAL weeks ago I wrote about sandwiches and buns. Today I want to
talk about other types of picnic food, not involving bread. There are so
many dishes suitable for picnics, but there are a few categories of
ingredient which are definitely not to be recommended for taking on a
picnic, and these are anything which has mayonnaise in, or whipped cream
as a filling (it is fine to take a bowl or container of whipped cream,
but not to use it as a filling for a meringue, sponge, or roulade) or
anything with chocolate as a filling or covering -- by which I mean that
chocolate brownies are fine, but that delicious dark chocolate uncooked
digestive biscuit fudgy cake is not.
The reason for these two exclusions -- and I would add a proviso, too,
against anything containing gelatine -- is the weather. In the heat
mayonnaise becomes slimy and oily, whipped cream melts into a buttery
puddle, and chocolate is just a mess.
There are occasions when an elegant picnic is called for -- events
such as school open days, for example. Ideas for such events are no
problem at all. Depending on who is going to eat the food and their
likes and dislikes, you can make small quails' eggs into scotch eggs,
using good quality sausages skinned and flattened, to encase the
hardboiled shelled quails' eggs.
If you like, you can press the sausagemeat-covered eggs into sesame
seeds, which I mix with a couple of pinches of salt, and fry them
gently, easiest in a non-stick frying pan, with the minimum of sunflower
oil and butter, mixed. Any good savoury tart makes an ideal main course,
with bowls of salad, small cherry tomatoes, and crudites to accompany
it.
I was once a finalist in a Krug picnic competition -- what an
experience! My interpretation of a picnic suitable for Henley Regatta
was completely different from that of my fellow finalists, all chefs
from hotels and restaurants with glittering reputations, and each so
nice. But oh! the contrast between me and them. For my picnic I took my
sister, as my permitted one assistant -- the others had commis chefs in
attendance. I took a spinach and cheese terrine with tomato and basil
salad for my first course, with a salmon and dill tart for the main
course, and a walnut and brown sugar meringue, with strawberries and
lemon and elderflower curd as the pud.
One of my fellow competitors even brought a gas oven and roasted duck
breasts, another was spinning sugar over a beautiful but elaborate sweet
concoction. I was way out of my league. The judges thought so, too, and
I came fourth, but I came home with a case of awfully good champagne.
It's just the differing conceptions of picnic food that still intrigue
me. If I took a portable gas oven to school open day my children would
die of embarrassment.
Very simple food is the best of all for knife-and-fork picnics. If you
have a good and capacious ice box a dish of cold salmon, or even of
assorted fish and shellfish (shelled, no messing about), with a
container of mayonnaise, salad, and a couple of different breads, it
makes a perfect main course. Cold roast or barbecued fillet of beef,
ready sliced, and with a horseradish and creme fraiche simple sauce in a
separate container is an alternative to the fish.
But the sausagemeat and thyme pastry roll has sustained a wide range
of age groups on picnics with us on many occasions.
SAUSAGEMEAT AND THYME PASTRY ROLL
Serves 4-6
2oz butter
1 onion, skinned and finely chopped
1 clove garlic, skinned and very finely chopped
1lb pork sausages -- slit each with the tip of a sharp knife and peel
off the skins
A large pinch of dried thyme or the small leaves stripped off a twig
of fresh thyme
2 apples, peeled, cored, and chopped
Plenty of freshly ground black pepper
1lb puff pastry
beaten egg
Melt the butter and cook the chopped onion and garlic till the onion
is soft, 3-5 min, depending on the size of the pan. Put the chopped
apples, thyme, and sausagemeat into the pan and break up the sausages
into the onions and apples with your wooden spoon. Cook, browning the
sausagemeat. Season with pepper -- the sausages will have sufficient
saltiness for most tastes. Let this mixture cool,  after about 10
minutes' cooking time.  Roll out the pastry and lay the cooled mixture
in a fat line down the centre,leaving a couple of inches at either end.
Fold the sides and ends together and pinch together. Brush with beaten
egg and slip the roll on to a baking sheet -- no need to oil it first --
bake in a hot oven till the pastry is browned and puffed up, about 20-25
minutes. 425F, 220C, gas mark 7.

A COMPANY controlled by two American brothers is the new owner of John
O'Groats House Hotel.
The move by the Kurfunkle investment banking group has led to fresh
speculation about plans for a major tourist development based at the
hotel.
First floated in 1991 by financier Peter de Savary, the #2.7m project
is currently in mothballs. The scheme, intended to create 100 new jobs,
involved a major revamp of the existing hotel, along with an adjoining
150-seat auditorium-theatre. The delays led to a previous offer of
#800,000 from the local enterprise company being withdrawn.
The hotel is run by Land's End and John O'Groats Ltd, which is owned
by New Zealand firm Gulf Resources Pacific. GRP had bought the firm from
another New Zealand company, City Realities, which had in 1991 bought
out Mr de Savary's controlling interest.
GRP's former parent company, Gulf USA Corporation Inc, has been bought
over by Kurfunkle. Mr Cairns Boston, managing director of John O'Groats
and Lands End Ltd, yesterday said the new owners have still to decide
whether or not to go ahead with the tourist venture.
''It's been a great personal disappointment that we we've not been
able to go ahead with this.''
However, Mr Boston stressed the company's plans are still live. ''The
scheme has planning permission and we're ready to go if the funding
go-ahead was given.''
Mr Jon Poore, of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, said yesterday the
agency is keen to see development. ''John O'Groats has a world-wide name
but is desperately in need of investment. A lot of people go there, but
there's not a lot for them to do and see when they get there.''

THE journalist and staunch Scottish nationalist Michael Grieve, who
was the son of the poet Hugh MacDiarmid, has died after a long battle
with throat cancer. He was 63.
Mr Grieve, who co-edited a book of his father's poetry, The Hugh
MacDiarmid Anthology, died at his home in the West End of Glasgow early
yesterday. He is survived by his wife, journalist Deirdre Chapman, and
three sons.
His fight against throat cancer began 10 years ago when he underwent a
laryngectomy, later learning to use oesophageal speech to communicate.
The cancer recurred about three years ago.
Tributes to Mr Grieve -- who worked for the SNP, newspapers such as
the Daily Record and Daily Express, and Scottish Television -- were paid
yesterday by leading poets and close friends Norman MacCaig and Sorley
MacLean, and by writer Alan Bold, who wrote a biography of McDiarmid
with the help of Mr Grieve.
Norman MacCaig, who is now 84 and lives in Edinburgh, said: ''I am
very sad to learn of Mike's death. We were good friends for many years
and I admired him because of the way he fought against his illness and
because he was a man who spoke his mind -- you always knew what he was
thinking.''
Sorley MacLean, who is 83 and lives on Skye, said: ''He had a very
independent mind and was very direct and I had a very high regard for
him. He had a great sense of loyalty to Scotland and was a man of
courage and independence.''
Alan Bold, who won the McVitie Prize for Scottish writing in 1989 for
his biography MacDiarmid, said Mr Grieve was a ''pugnacious and lovable
character''.
Mr Bold said Mr Grieve loved Scotland and once went to prison to prove
it -- referring to his spell in Saughton prison in Edinburgh in the
early 1950s after refusing to do National Service on nationalist
grounds, claiming any war he might be called to serve in would be
England's war.
Mr Bold said: ''In 1970, I debated with him in Aberdeen University --
he speaking up for an independent Scottish state, me for the status quo.
He was his own man and persuaded me that his vision of Scotland was
inspired by more than his old man's verse.''
Tributes to Mr Grieve were also paid by the Scottish National Party,
where he was the party's vice-convener for publicity from 1979 to 1981.
Mr Grieve's funeral is to be held at Glasgow Crematorium in Tresta
Road, Maryhill, on Wednesday.

THE Wallace Monument in Elderslie was still awaiting a last-minute
clean-up today just hours before the annual rally at the site.
Opposition Renfrew district councillors branded the eleventh-hour
operation a ''shambles'', particularly with attention focused on Wallace
because of the imminent Scottish premiere of the film Braveheart.
An annual march and rally is held in the town, birthplace of the great
patriot, but there has been an increasing problem with vandalism over
the years.
SNP leaders claim there have already been two failed attempts to erase
vandalism this year and now it has been left to council contractors due
to start the work at 7am today.
SNP Councillor Jim Mitchell said the clean-up had been a ''shambles''
from start to finish. He claimed FCB Securities had failed to carry out
the contract yesterday. A second contractor had not done the job
properly.
Mrs May Brown, chairperson of the William Wallace Society of Elderslie
-- which now counts Braveheart star Mel Gibson as a member -- said the
eleventh-hour operation was ''a bit much''.
Leisure and recreation convener Councillor Bobbie Stevenson defended
the council's actions.
He said: ''It was cleaned about six weeks ago but more graffiti has
since appeared. I deliberately left the work until the day before the
rally so that it could not be vandalised before the event started.''
Wallace Day is organised annually to mark the anniversary of the
patriot's execution in London on August 23, 1305.

A YOUTH who burgled the home of one of Scotland's top policemen was
jailed for five months yesterday. Peter Whyte, 17, admitted breaking
into the home of Tayside Chief Constable William Spence and stealing
property worth #5000.
Whyte broke into Mr Spence's home on April 1, the first day of the new
chief's appointment, prompting speculation that the robbery had been
deliberately timed to embarrass him. However, it emerged that Whyte had
been unaware of the owner's identity.

It could seem all too easy -- follow in the footsteps of a hero, write
it up, get shortlisted for a major award . . . It happened almost this
way for Gavin Bell but, as he explains, it wasn't all plain sailing
towards that first book. Here he looks back on the experience of writing
In Search of Tusitala: Travels in the Pacific after Robert Louis
Stevenson and, in an extract from the book, describes a visit to
Fakarava, a remote atoll in the Tuamotu archipelago, where R L S spent
two weeks in September 1880 with his American wife Fanny, his mother,
and his stepson Lloyd Osbourne
THERE is an element of insane optimism in writing a book. It
presupposes that someone will see some commercial advantage in
publishing it, and that others will wish to read it. Given the legions
of aspiring authors besieging editors' offices, the prospects of any one
of them making it into print are only marginally better than winning the
National Lottery.
In my case, I was only half mad. Before setting off to collect
material for my book, I had received an assurance that it would be
published -- providing it lived up to expectations -- along with a
handsome advance on royalties. But I still had an uneasy suspicion that
I had embarked on a venture that owed more to optimism than realism.
It all began with a fairly simple idea. I had long been an admirer of
Robert Louis Stevenson, both as a man and as a writer, and the centenary
of his death was approaching. I had been fascinated in particular by his
travels in the South Seas, where he eventually settled and died in a
place he called ''beautiful beyond dreams''. The idea was to retrace his
voyages, and compare his experiences and observations with my own a
century later. I envisaged a kind of quest for Treasure Island and the
blithe spirit of its creator.
At first, I thought it was a great idea. On reflection, it seemed
pretty stupid to abandon a career as a foreign correspondent with the
Times for the vagaries of travel writing on my own account. Happily fate
intervened at this point in the form of a new editor, who decreed that I
should be reassigned to London. The choice between Tottenham and Tahiti
was decided in an instant.
My first step was to find a literary agent. I had been assured by
friends who had written books that this was essential and it proved to
be sound advice. I could have blundered around publishers' offices for
months without getting anywhere close to the deal secured by my agent
within a matter of days. I was lucky. The agent who expressed an
interest in my idea was a respected figure with a stable of fine
writers. The first thing he did was tell me to rewrite my synopsis.
''Better,'' he said of my second attempt, ''but still not good
enough.'' My third attempt received grudging approval: ''Fine. I think
we may now proceed.'' I proceeded to tour the Highlands with a friend,
while my agent alerted the publishing fraternity to the potential new
talent in its midst. He is a man of persuasive powers, you understand.
I was in a hotel in Mallaig when he called to ask if I would like to
sign a deal with a prominent publisher for a substantial sum of money. I
distinctly remember two seagulls screeching off my windowsill in alarm
at my whoops of joy. ''I will take that as an affirmative, shall I?'' my
agent asked. He is a laconic kind of fellow.
''So what do I do now?'' I wanted to know.
''You trot off and write the magnus opus, old chap,'' he said.
The magnitude of the task facing me sank home as I sat in a packed
aircraft at Glasgow airport, waiting to take off for Chicago and an
onward connection to San Francisco. Rain was sweeping across the tarmac,
my family and friends had gone, and suddenly I felt awfully alone. The
struggle between excitement and fear ended in a draw.
For the next eight months, I wandered the length and breadth of the
Pacific with notebook and camera, becoming progressively enchanted and
bemused by some of the most remote societies on earth. There were
moments of utter bliss, such as strolling by a Tahitian lagoon by
moonlight, but there were also periods of anxiety and loneliness.
Towards the end of my travels, I met a man in Samoa who said: ''I have
always considered it unnatural for anyone to eat or sleep alone.'' I had
been doing a lot of both for a long time, and I was becoming weary. It
came as no great surprise to me when, on my return to Britain, I
collapsed with nervous exhaustion.
Having recovered sufficiently to face a blank computer screen, with
prodigious piles of notes on either side of it, I faced another problem.
RLS had encountered it a century before, in writing his South Seas
travel book, as he related in a letter to Henry James:
''What a strain is a long book! The time it took me to design this
volume, before I could dream of putting pen to paper, was excessive; and
then think of writing a book of travels on the spot, when I am
continually extending my information, revising my opinions, and seeing
the most finely finished portions of my work come part by part in
pieces. Very soon I shall have no opinions left. And without an opinion,
how to string artistically vast accumulations of fact?''
It was comforting to know that my hero, with all his passion and
brilliance, had endured the same agonies that were assailing me. But I
had my ''intro'' -- that magical, liberating, opening paragraph from
which hopefully all else would flow had been in my mind for a long time.
Seeing it appear on my computer screen at the start of my book was one
of the most deeply satisfying moments of my career.
Thereafter, I set myself the fairly modest target of 1000 words a day,
calculating that this would produce the 100,000 words suggested by my
agent in about five months.
In fact, it took closer to eight months of more or less complete
dedication. I did not have the distractions of a family, but neither did
I have its comforts. Working alone, day after day, with little more than
enthusiasm for my subject to carry me through, required reserves of
discipline and commitment which I was not aware I possessed.
Writing a book is like riding an emotional roller-coaster. There are
days when you review what was written the day before and find it quite
good; there are others when you wonder how you could have written
anything so unutterably bad. Then along comes a friend, who pronounces
you the great undiscovered talent of British literature, and you press
on. At this stage you are prepared to believe anything that encourages
you to finish the damn thing.
The last words in my book are: ''Thus the dead man speaks to you from
the dust: you will hear no more from him.'' When I wrote those lines,
from Stevenson's epitaph, it was not with any great sense of
accomplishment -- but rather with enormous relief. On balance, I had
enjoyed my first experience of authorship, but I was glad it was over.
Again I was lucky in having a skilled editor who distilled the best of
my work in a handsome volume. I was delighted with the jacket design,
and the general appearance of the book, when finally an advance copy
arrived. But I felt curiously detached from it. There was my name on the
cover, my photograph on the fly-leaf, and my words on the pages, but the
intimate bond between book and author had gone. It was as if I had given
birth to a child who had walked away from me.
Favourable reviews did little to reunite us, and the day of
publication was an anti-climax. Unless you are a celebrated author, or
have influential friends in the publishing world, nothing very much
happens. You are assured that vans should be delivering copies of the
book (along with countless others) to shops throughout the country, and
that's it. I resisted the temptation to trawl around bookstores, and
went for a beer and a curry with a few chums.
It was at this point that I discovered that a lot of bookshops seem to
be staffed by snotty people who do not care about books in general, and
your own in particular. Inquiries about whether it is in stock elicit
vague responses; a friend discovers it is sold out in a particular shop,
informs the manager, and is advised to look elsewhere for it.
It is, of course, that old crazy optimism to blame again for delusions
that your book will be accorded a special place in shops among the
thousands of volumes that flood into them every week. Sometimes a little
affirmative action helps, though. One day I found a copy of my book on a
shelf in an obscure corner of a large store in London. I removed it,
placed it face up on a display table marked ''Travel'', and had the
satisfaction of watching someone buying it five minutes later.
But gradually the novelty wears off, an offer of a return to a staff
job is gratefully accepted, and thoughts of the book and all that went
into it begin to fade. It becomes, in the words of Stevenson describing
one of his own lesser-known works, '' . . . a respectable little
five-bob volume, to bloom unread in shop windows.''
Then, sometimes, out of the blue, something wondrous happens. Last
month I learned that my book had been short-listed for an award.
Suddenly it was alive again, reminding me of the good times and the
tribulations we had shared. I entertain no serious thoughts of winning
the prize; it has been enough to know the insane optimism was justified.
The danger is that I might be daft enough to write another.
* In Search of Tusitala: Travels in the Pacific after Robert Louis
Stevenson, by Gavin Bell, has been short-listed for the Thomas
Cook/Daily Telegraph Travel Book Award 1995.

MORE than 50 detectives are trying to find a motive for an attack on a
young mother who died yesterday, a week after being savagely beaten as
she walked her family's pet dog.
Mrs Vikki Thompson, 30, died in an Oxford hospital without recovering
consciousness.
She was attacked near her home in Ascott-under-Wychwood, Oxfordshire,
but there were no clear signs the assault was sexually or robbery
motivated.
The investigation team was boosted to 54 officers and today they begin
intensive house-to-house inquiries in the quiet village.
Trains travelling on the Cotswold line past the murder spot will carry
posters asking if anyone saw Mrs Thompson walking with Daisy, her dog,
on the trackside bridleway last Saturday.
Detective Superintendent David Blair, leading the hunt, said: ''I
don't believe it was a robbery and there is no evidence of sexual
assault.
''The motive is not clear.''
The victim's necklace was found near the path where police believe she
was first attacked and a bracelet belonging to her was found close to
where she was found.
Mrs Thompson's husband, Jonathan, 30, a computer software salesman,
was at his wife's bedside when she died.
His brother-in-law, Mr Graham Simpson, said later: ''We have lost a
treasure today. The family would like to be left alone with our grief.''
Police believe a member of the public may hold the vital clue to the
case.
Mr Blair said: ''We need the public's help with information. People
should not assume we will know something. They should contact us.''
He appealed for any person who was on the Oxford Way last Saturday
between 10am and 7pm to contact him, whether they think they can help or
not.
Detectives are also looking for a missing dog lead, described as
brown, extendable, and made by Flexi.
The Thompsons' children, Matthew, seven, and Jenny, five, have been
staying with relatives since last weekend.
The family were alerted that something was wrong when the dog arrived
home alone.
A police search found Mrs Thompson's body on the popular beauty spot
two hours later.

<RECORDNO>976814202</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FARMER was was fined #450 yesterday for taking two huge horses
inside a court.
The two shires, each weighing around a ton, caused an uproar as Mr
Jimmy Wilson led them through the plate glass doors and across the
marble foyer at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Security men and police were not amused as George, the stallion, and
King, a mare, did their business on the floor.
Mr Wilson told the same court yesterday that the horses were his key
witnesses in a civil case which was later dismissed.
Yesterday, Sheriff Alexander Eccles found Mr Wilson, 53, guilty of
breach of the peace at the court on November 24 last year. Mr Wilson, of
Kenmuir Farm, Mount Vernon, Glasgow, defended himself.
Security men and police told Mr Martin Spevack, prosecuting that there
was a commotion when Mr Wilson led his two large horses across the
marble hall towards the front desk at 2pm that day.
Press cameras were flashing and they were concerned for the safety of
the public, who were entering the building at the time.
Security man John McNeill, 40, said the accused was shouting: ''You
can't hold us back. I want in,'' as he led the horses towards the front
desk.
The horses were beginning to ''stamp around'' as the cameras flashed.
Asked by Mr Spevack how big the horses were, he said: ''I'm five feet
eleven inches and they were bigger than me.''
The court heard the horses were led out by police and security men and
tethered to a rail outside the building. But not before they had left a
lot of evidence about their presence behind on the polished floors and
carpets.
In his evidence, Mr Wilson told the court he was due in court to
contest a council order trying to force him to keep his horses and other
livestock off neighbouring land.
''They said about 40 of my horses were involved but I have only George
and King and I wanted the sheriff to see them to prove it,'' he said.
Questioned by Mr Spevack about the danger to the public, the accused
said his two horses were so gentle that children played with them. ''I
take them to let handicapped children see them and the kids play between
the horses' feet,'' he said.
Mr WilsonMr Wilson Asked if it would not have been more sensible to
leave the horses outside and let the sheriff come out to see them, Mr
Wilson said : ''I really didn't think that way.''
Outside court, Mr Wilson said he was now preparing for another court
battle after raising a #12.9m action against the Scottish Office.
Mr Wilson demolished many of the old Glasgow tenements, stock-piled
thousands of tons of the valuable red and grey sandstone on his land,
and claims huge quantities were taken without his knowledge to use on
the M74 construction.
The case is expected to be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.

AN exhibition of broken pottery? Surely not! But, yes, Sotheby's are
holding just that in their Bond Street rooms from August 21 to September
22. It's not just any old pottery, of course, but 150 pieces of domestic
ware reconstructed from shards found in the reject pile of an imperial
kiln in Jingdezhen, southern China. The china was all made in the
Chenghua period (1465-1487) and represents some of the finest and rarest
types of Chinese porcelain.
Because the china was being made for the exclusive use of the Emperor,
quality control was rigorous and often, out of a run of 500,000 wine
cups, only 100,000 were chosen. The others seem to have been broken by a
single hammer blow and so are often reconstructable.
The exhibition is worth visiting because the designs are exquisite,
the clay impeccably fine, and the colours -- blues and whites, copper
red, Imperial yellow and celadon -- are still strong.

<RECORDNO>976814205</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE detective leading the hunt for a man who threw a young girl from a
speeding train warned yesterday that her attacker was a potential killer
with ''a total disregard for human life''.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is recovering in
hospital from severe pelvic injuries, a broken arm, and multiple
bruising sustained during her ordeal on Wednesday night. It is believed
that she underwent surgery yesterday.
Police believe the train, an evening service from East Grinstead to
London Victoria, may have been travelling at up to 60mph when the
attacker pushed the 14-year-old girl through a door and on to the
trackside.
The man, described as black, around 6ft tall, and in his late 20s, was
understood to have become enraged when the girl refused his offer of a
drink from a can of lager.
Detective Chief Inspector Vic Miller of British Transport Police told
a news conference yesterday that it was urgent that attacker was caught
quickly.
''This is a man who quite spontaneously has the potential to kill,''
he said. ''He is a person with an extreme propensity for violence and a
total disregard for human life.''
The girl was attacked near South Croydon railway station, south
London, and crawled in agony about 150 yards to the station platform to
raise the alarm.
She had been travelling on the 2138 service from East Grinstead with
friends but they got off at Sanderstead shortly before she was attacked
after 10pm near South Croydon station.
She was spotted on a station platform by two men and taken to hospital
where, Mr Miller said a policewoman had been at the girl's bedside
almost constantly.
Mr Miller said she had managed to pass on some details about the
incident and her attacker, who was a skinny man with a gold tooth, a
gold ear ring, and a pockmarked face.
He also had a small beard covering his chin and hair which was short
at the back and sides but curly on top.
He was wearing a green and white check shirt, blue jeans, and trainers
and was carrying a Safeway supermarket bag containing a number of cans
of cider and lager.
Police are hoping the girl will be able to help compile a likeness of
him today, although she remains in a great deal of pain and discomfort.
Mr Miller said the train, and all the locks on the doors were examined
for clues and officers had travelled on the same service last night in
an effort to find passengers who might have information.
Earlier, police took advantage of gaps between services to search the
trackside and recovered two hairbands and a shoe belonging to the girl.
Recordings from security video cameras at stations along the route
were also being examined.

THE likeness of Mike Grieve to his father, the Great MacDiarmid, was
unmistakable: they were cast from the same slab of Scottish marble.
Seen together, they appeared more like brothers. With a bottle of
Glenlivet on the table, they would kindle pipes filled with dark tobacco
and espouse the cause of their beloved country.
Both were fundamentally journalists with a claymore to grind.
MacDiarmid the poet roared into battle, achieving notoriety as well as
fame. Mike, with rather less poetic talent, often scorched editorial
ears with his nationalistic passion. They were men of immense courage.
Their fervour, however, was intellectual rather than physical and
concealed an inner gentleness and dry sense of humour which the public
seldom saw.
When MacDiarmid (Chris, as we knew him) died, Mike set out to promote
the works of the father he adored, often in the teeth of opposition from
lesser Scots whose appreciation of poetry did not extend beyond the
couthy rhyming couplet or their blind adulation of Burns.
In 1972, The Hugh MacDiarmid Anthology, edited by Michael Grieve and
Alexander Scott, became a definitive work.
I first knew Mike in the sixties when he and his wife, Deirdre, joined
the Scottish Daily Express. Impatient of my physical lameness, he would
hoist me on to his back and run up four flights of stairs to his eyrie
home in Glasgow's West End.
''You're wasting valuable drinking time,'' he would chide me; but it
was the conviviality of friends and the love of gentle argument which
spurred him on.
Nearly 10 years ago, he embarked on a personal battle against cancer
of the throat, stoical and cheerful as ever.
I like to think that the two soft-centred men of marble are now
together again, father and son, brother and brother. The small white
rose of Scotland is the more pungent for their passing.

LABOUR MP George Galloway last night demanded that Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind summon the Indian High Commissioner to explain the
''exact relationship'' between the Al-Faran hostage takers and the
Indian Government.
Mr Galloway, MP for Glasgow Hillhead, issued the call after a report
in The Herald suggested a secret Indian Government ''dirty tricks''
operation could be responsible for the plight of the captives.
The report also said India had so far resisted an offer by London to
provide an SAS assault team to help rescue the four.
A ''senior military source'' told The Herald it was increasingly
probable that Al-Faran was armed and funded by India, and may even be
led by Indian undercover commandos or Afghan mercenaries.
Recent events bore hallmarks of an operation by India to isolate
Islamic militants by turning international opinion against them, the
source said.
Mr Galloway said the report supported the ''growing belief in informed
circles'' that the kidnapping was a dirty tricks operation by the Indian
intelligence service, RAW, to discredit ''the freedom fighters of
Kashmir''.
''It may be that we are on the cusp of one of the greatest
international scandals of modern times.
He said that Indian-occupied Kashmir was already ''hell on earth''.
A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment on any deployment of
special forces, and also declined to comment on allegations of Indian
involvement.
''Our interest is in the safety and early release of these people,''
he said.

After 12 months' hard work, venue hunting, and sleepless nights, Carol
Clewlow is finally set for the Fringe opening of her adapted novel One
for the Money
DEAR Doctor, I wake up in the middle of the night sweating. I have
panic attacks that leave me sick with fear. I have headaches too and I'm
drinking too much. And, oh yeah, I've started comfort eating.
Dear Carol,
Don't worry about it. There's a lot of it about this time of year. We
call it, in the business, Fringe-itis . . .
I can't remember exactly when I started thinking seriously about
adapting One for the Money for a stage performance with a view to taking
it to the Fringe, probably back in the autumn of last year when the
hardback came out.
For those who don't know, the novel One for the Money is set in the
rock music business. It's told in the first person and is, basically,
the recollections of a fallen female rock star called Joanie.
It contains original lyrics, specially written for the book, by Pete
Scott, a singer-songwriter and long-time friend whose career, for three
years, I inadequately managed.
I loved the songs. They always seemed so much a part of Joanie even
though they were written by someone else, and it was my dream, early on,
to present them, on stage, with the words, the way they are in the book.
The Edinburgh Fringe seemed an ideal opportunity since it would
coincide with the publication of the paperback, and once the idea was
firmed up, I started to keep a diary.
I'm no Pepys, though, that much I know now.
Sometimes I was too tired to write, sometimes, frankly, too fed up.
Sometimes I wrote pages of drunken self-pitying drivel, and there's more
than one eloquent scrawled obscenity. In the end, the cheque-book turned
out to be the best diary of all.
Because we did try for sponsors, but in the end without success,
except that is for Kodak who, unaccountably, and with a charming lack of
fuss, sent us a much-needed projector.
Mainly it was all a matter of bad timing. I managed to deliver my
begging letter to Northern Electric the day that Trafalgar House
announced their unwanted takeover bid. I guess the letter is still in
someone's in-tray.
I also wrote to British Rail the day ASLEF announced the strikes. I
have this theory that companies live in fear of my letters.
We started rehearsing with not much more than some ideas back in
November and the script evolved more than was written, taking the songs
and fitting the words round them.
What I was aiming for was to present the emotions of the rock'n'roll
life, the touring, the drugs, money, etc, rather than the story of the
novel which would have been impossible to narrate in an 80-minute show.
We rehearsed, in the first instance, in the studio of Pete's home. I
remember particularly the day the kids came home from school and stood
at the glass door making faces.
Dan, my godson, eventually pushed his way in despite being told not
to. He leant against the wall in that sceptical way nine year olds do,
legs nonchalantly crossed at the ankles.
''What are you doing?'' he asked.
''Good question,'' I answered. Because the defining emotion of the
last nine months or so has been complete confusion, amazement that we've
actually undertaken this thing.
One of the first things I did back in January was to go on this
pilgrimage -- no other word for it -- to Westminster Abbey, to Dickens's
tomb. Dickens is my hero, not just for his writing which I go to all the
time like a Bible, but because he performed his work.
They queued round the block for tickets for Dickens. He came back from
a tour of America with $20,000 in his pocket. I wish . . . I wish . . .
He took his own set with him too, a rug and a desk on which he would
lean. He held the audience in the proverbial palm of his hand.
Contemporary accounts speak of his expressive eyes, his hands . . .
I sat on a chair looking at the slab with is name on it, trying to
invoke his blessing with the tourists milling about me. ''Of course, he
didn't want to be buried here at all,'' said the attendant, somehow
spoiling everything.
I lit a candle on the way out and prayed for the show to anyone who
was listening.
That same day I advanced my plan to Penguin, my publishers. Afterwards
it seemed to me that I'd announced it too breathlessly, like a gay
coming out of the closet.''I've turned the book into a show and we're
going to take it to the Fringe . . . '' I wonder now what I thought they
would say.
That was the day I discovered it was completely impossible to talk
seriously and eat at the same time. It's hard to make out a case for
something close to your hearts with tagliatelle trickling down your
chin. I still wonder how the high-fliers do it.
From there I went on to see my agent. He furrowed his brow, manfully
trying to understand. ''So it's basically a monologue, is it?'' he said
finally. I looked deep into his eyes and swore to the Gods that it would
be something much more than that.
By then I'd sent off my #5 and received back the Fringe's first
handbook, How To Do a Show at The Fringe.
It's full of useful advice, the most important being don't bother
unless you're absolutely sure. Because the facts are daunting, 1000
groups, at close on 200 venues, presenting 1500 different shows.
''If you are in any doubt about the readiness of your show, you should
seriously considering postponing your appearance for a year, and use
this extra time for preparation,'' it warns. I believe when I die,
unlike Queen Mary, that's what they'll find written on my heart.
When I look back now, all I see is a series of embarrassing gaffes.
What I yearned for again and again was to turn the clock back, to start
over and do it all right. I still flush with embarrassment at the memory
of calling up the Assembly Rooms some time in January and gaily trying
to book space.
It was explained to me, in a kindly fashion, that I had to apply; that
there would be a lot of people with a lot of shows trying to get into
the Assembly Rooms.
When the voice at the other end of the phone asked me what show I
represented, I suddenly didn't want to tell him. It occurred to me to
lie, to say for instance that I was Meryl Streep and I was doing a
one-woman show featuring 30 different accents ranging from a Walloon
with Ukranian parentage to a member of the Ubu tribe in South-west
Sudan. But in the end I just mumbled something noncommittal and hung up.
We did apply to both Assembly and Pleasance in the end. Somehow, I now
don't known how, I manged to convince myself we'd get in. We didn't and
they let us know in good time.
Unfortunately the Post Office intervened in untimely fashion with a
postal strike on Tyneside that held up mail for the best part of a
month. By the time we found out we were venueless it was the beginning
of May and things were now serious.
We then spent a wet unseasonally cold May day in Edinburgh traipsing
around venues. I remember still how astonished I was that people seemed
to be taking me seriously. I wanted to scream that I was a beginner and
they should know, right from the start, that I didn't have the first
idea what I was doing.
We drove home though, high as kites, because we thought we'd found the
most perfect place, the most perfect slot, too. But by the time we'd got
home and faxed the theatre company in New York, the wires were already
crossed and someone else had nipped in before us. So two days later we
started all over again.
I was sick by now. I just wanted to give in. I wanted it all to go
away, another defining emotion I believe when you're putting on a show
at the Fringe.
I rang our director trying to make excuses. He was soothing. ''So you
can go next year . . . ,'' he said. I went to bed comforted, but then
suddenly, next day, half against my will, it all fell into place.
One of the other venues I'd contacted, but not even got around to
checking out, had a slot free through someone else pulling out. I didn't
know whether to be happy or sad. I'd had a whole sweet night of sleep
thinking it was all over.
But the venue organiser, Ed Lewis, of the Asymmetric Theatre Company,
turned out to be extraordinarily helpful and a man quite clearly used to
dealing with Fringe virgins.
So on May 13 it all finally became a reality. I sent off the cheque to
Ed and the cheque to the Fringe. We were in. And I resigned myself to a
summer of not sleeping.
Writing the cheque for the venue underlined forcibly just how much we
were spending. I kept thinking of that word the hero uses in Bonfire of
the Vanities, how he sees the money ''haemorrhaging'' out of his
account. A glance at my bank statement showed me the word was
appropriate.
I thought a visit to my accountant prudent. I sat in front of his desk
and took the bull by the horns. ''I'm using the money put by for July's
tax to take the show to the Fringe,'' I said. I could have kissed him
for his reply. ''I'll tell the Revenue then, shall I?'' he said calmly.
Our director is Piers Ibbotson, an assistant director with the RSC,
who took the project, like most of those involved, for precious little
reward. He came up to Tyneside with RSC at the beginning of March and
gave us three blissful days, tearing the show apart and then putting it
all back together again 50 times better.
Whatever happens, they remain three of the best, most stimulating days
of my life. I saw how a director worked and was left to wonder.
The entries in the diary for the period are nothing more than scrawls.
I was too tired every night to do much more than fall into bed. On the
last night I collapsed on the kitchen floor unable to crawl to the
kettle. Suddenly, being a writer seemed an easy way to make a living.
We rehearsed in the Amber Films studios overlooking the Tyne. It was
bitterly cold but with a crystal-clear sky. We'd adjourn for coffee
upstairs in the gallery where we'd thrown open the shutters and look
down at the road and the dockside development and the ships going up and
down the river below.
On the second afternooon we were deep in an analysis of the script
when Pete's attention unaccountably wandered.
''I'm sorry,'' he said, ''but there's a half-naked couple in the car
outside having sex.'' And there was.
Another day when we were there one of our cars was broken into. Pete
was the first out of the door. When he rounded the corner there were two
boys in balaclavas on mountain bikes. Seeing him, one of them raised his
baseball bat.
''Fine, fine,'' Pete said sensibly, backing away and holding up his
hands. Discretion is the better part of valour for a guitarist with
fingers to protect.
Our first outing in front of the public was at the Royal Exchange
Theatre in Manchester on March 18. We were there for the Times/Penguin
Fiction Day and were first on.
I was encouraged by the fact that the place was almost full. But then
looking around at the faces it suddenly occurred to me that they could
well be there for whoever was due on afterwards.
It's not easy, let me tell you, doing sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll at
10 in the morning, particularly if you think the audience is waiting for
Penelope Lively. But they clapped anyway, and Penelope, bless her, gave
me a smile as we came off. Afterwards friends and relatives, who'd
sneaked in and hidden from sight, came out of the woodwork and we all
went out and got drunk.
It didn't really all come together though until the first full gig in
Durham in June. That was when we really felt we'd arrived.
It was a full show by this time with the back-projected images shot by
Simon Veit-Wilson the young photographer, who is also our stage manager.
We didn't know what a stage manager was when he gave him the title and
neither did he. But since he could put plugs on and also knew what went
on underneath a car bonnet, we figured he'd be good for the job.
Photographing the images was fun and took us to a variety of
locations. In the book, in true rock-star fashion, Joanie buys a stately
home in the country. I managed to convince the owner of one such pile to
allow us to photograph his house and gardens.
We arrived in Simon's mustard rusting X-reg Golf and parked up among
the BMWs and Range Rovers. It was March and a day so cold your fingers
stopped working. We took the pictures to the accompaniment of jets
screaming down from the North Northumberland Nato bombing ranges and the
pop-pop of shotguns shooting little furry animals.
''Ah, the peace and quiet of the country . . . ,'' I said.
I know we're going on at the Fringe now because I've just paid my
final venue instalment. Also I have a pile of tickets on my dining-room
table with the name of the show on, and if I want to, which I don't, I
can read all about us in the Fringe programme.
There's some adjustments to the set to carry out, programme sheets to
print, books to order, leaflets to collect, CD artwork to finish off . .
. oh yes, did I tell you . . . we're also bringing out an album with the
show.  But, apart from that, we're ready.
''I've bought a sparkly jacket to wear on stage and Pete's learnt to
say ''dichotomy'' in case we get invited on to The Late Show.
We're at Old St Paul's Church Hall, Jeffrey Street, 12.30pm each day,
barring Sunday, from August 21 to September 2.
Be there. Please.

<HEADLINE>Convicted fraudster is new director of housing</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976814211</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COUNCIL housing chief, sacked after being convicted of fraud, has
been appointed director of housing for the new unitary authority taking
over from his previous employer.
John Hillis, 49, was fined #500 after he admitted fiddling his
expenses as the #18,000-a-year housing manager of Cumnock and Doon
Valley District Council.
Now it has emerged that he is to take over as director of housing for
the new East Ayrshire Council -- on a salary of #60,000.
Mr Hillis was charged by detectives following an internal inquiry at
Cumnock and Doon Valley's HQ in Lugar, Cumnock.
On January 14, 1988, he appeared at Ayr Sheriff Court and pled not
guilty to two charges of fraudulently claiming expenses.
It was alleged that he falsely claimed #187.50 on May 14, 1985, after
a visit to Birmingham, and #113.26 on July 21, 1985, for a trip to
Aberdeen.
On March 31, 1988, he pled guilty to a lesser charge of defrauding the
council of #91.76 by submitting false expense claims.
Sheriff Ian McMillan fined him #500 and he was later sacked by Cumnock
and Doon Valley District Council.
He lost an appeal against his dismissal amid a row which caused deep
friction in the ruling Labour group of the day.
Mr Hillis re-emerged in local government when he was appointed housing
manager with Cumnock and Doon Valley's neighbouring council, Kilmarnock
and Loudon district.
He has remained there since and will take over the top housing job at
East Ayrshire when the shadow council -- which will absorb both
districts' areas -- takes power next April.
Last night, Mr Hillis defended himself against the controversy from
his desk at Kilmarnock and Loudon District Council's offices.
''I am disappointed if my appointment is causing unease in some
quarters but I can assure anyone with any concerns that they are
completely without substance and it is irresponsible to allege
otherwise.
''It is nearly eight years ago now and it's time to look to the
future.''
East Ayrshire council's leader, Mr David Sneller, said the council's
interview process was ''comprehensive and thorough'', and added: ''John
Hillis underwent that process and emerged clearly as the best person for
the director of housing post.
''He has the experience and the ability to take housing in East
Ayrshire into the next century.''
However, Ayr Tory MP Mr Phil Gallie compared the issue to Labour's
''Monklandsgate'' controversy. ''We've seen this all before and now
we're seeing it all over the country,'' he said.
''Maybe there are some in the new Labour authority who feel they have
to repay previous loyalties.''
One Cumnock and Doon Valley District Council employee, who asked not
to be named, said five candidates were shortlisted for the position and
some staff felt Cumnock and Doon Valley's existing housing manager,
Chris McAleavey, was the ''best man for the job''.
He added: ''Mr Hillis's appointment has caused anger and bitterness
among some staff. We can't understand the logic.
''Certainly, the staff's morale is rock bottom. We feel we are the
forgotten legion and we're sceptical about everything we hear now.''

<HEADLINE>Hospital seeks permission to stop feeding brain-damaged grandmother in a coma.  Court to decide on 'right to die'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAIN WILSON, CHIEF REPORTER,</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976814212</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A HOSPITAL is taking Scotland's first ''right to die'' case to court
in a bid to remove the drip feed that has kept a brain-damaged woman
alive for more than three years.
The Government last year refused to lift a ban on euthanasia and it is
expected that the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, or
representative, will contest the action.
Scottish Roman Catholic priest and pro-life protester James Morrow
might also take legal action against what he described last night as ''a
rejection of God''.
Law Hospital NHS Trust will go to the Court of Session in September or
October, seeking leave to withdraw artificial feeding of the coma
victim, a grandmother in her eighties.
The woman, who has not been named, is in a persistent vegetative state
-- similar to that of Tony Bland, who never awoke from a deep coma after
the Hillsborough football ground tragedy in 1989.
Mr Bland, 21, died last year when food and drugs were withdrawn at the
request of his parents, following an English High Court ruling and House
of Lords declaration that he should be allowed to die peacefully.
Confirmation of the Scottish action comes within a month of a historic
and controversial ruling in the Irish Republic's highest court allowing
Europe's longest surviving coma patient to die after 23 years unable to
move, feed, or communicate in hospital.
It is certain that Scotland's first ''right to die case'' will be as
high-pitched as those in England and Ireland.
Parallels can be drawn because of the implications for others lying in
a vegetative state and because of the complicated -- and
highly-emotional -- ethical, legal, and medical issues it raises.
Since being brought to Law Hospital, near Carluke, Lanarkshire, the
woman has been in a deep coma, and has shown no sign of recovery despite
constant nursing.
Doctors have talked with her immediate family about ways to end their
agony and also to allow her to die ''peacefully and with dignity''.
A hospital spokeswoman said the trust confirmed it was involved in a
case expected to go to court, and added: ''As the matter is sub judice,
we have been advised not to comment at this stage.''
A senior hospital official said the action would be raised by the
trust -- technically against the parent's immediate family and the Lord
Advocate.
The source claimed: ''It is being done this way as a legal move to
protect the family who simply wish to see an end to this long tragedy.
Senior executives in the hospital all know that the application will be
opposed by the Lord Advocate himself. The Lord Advocate has appointed a
Curator Agitem to represent the interest of the patient in court.''
If leave to withdraw the drip was granted, it could set a legal
precedent for other such actions in Scotland.
Father Morrow, of the Pro-Life Centre at Braemar -- who failed in a
bid to issue a private summons charging a physician with murder for
withdrawing Mr Bland's food and drugs -- said everyone was entitled to
be fed.
He added: ''I won't make any comment, other than that if there is a
chance of saving a life -- be it an unborn child, elderly person, or
comatose person -- I will take that chance.''
Ms June Andrews, Scottish secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
said of the Lanarkshire case: ''This will be a very difficult time for
the family, the nurses, and doctors.
''The Tony Bland case in England showed that it is vital to get the
legal position clarified so those who have to make these heart-breaking
decisions do not constantly have to be looking over their shoulders.
''Every doctor and every nurse will come across such a tragic case at
least once in their career. What this will do is set a protocol for such
situations in future.''

A JILTED lover who cut up thousands of pounds worth of his
girlfriend's designer clothes after she left him for another man was
ordered to do community service yesterday.
Lee Emery, 26, went on a #9000 spree of destruction when he took a
razor blade to his former girlfriend's Calvin Klein and Versace outfits,
Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.
He later phoned Miss Sonya Walmsley, 27, at work and told her if she
hated him now, she would hate him more when she got home.
Judge Nicholas Medawar, QC, said Emery, who could not face up to the
fact she did not want any more to do with him, had behaved ''extremely
foolishly''.
Emery, of Felstead Road, Collier Row, Romford, Essex, admitted
criminal damage to Miss Walmsley's clothes and a further count of
burglary.
The judge ordered Emery to complete 200 hours community service, and
to pay Miss Walmsley #5000 in compensation.

<TEXT>
A PUBLIC school pupil has been told she could not receive her A-level
results until her father paid her fees.
The teenager at Cheltenham's Dean Close School, whose fees are 18
months in arrears, was dismayed to hear: ''Sorry, no money, no grades.''
The chairman of governors, Mr Colin Cocks, said: ''I think other
schools might have withdrawn her before now, but we are a Christian
school.''
The girl went to headteacher Christopher Bacon to protest supported by
a group of friends, but he said his hands were tied.
Sympathetic parents then called on the school to relent and give the
girl the results -- for English, History of Art, and Classical
Civilisation exams -- which could map her future career.
The head said he was ''mortified'' at having to tell the girl the
decision of the school governors' finance committee.
''It is one of the saddest decisions of my life.''
Mr Bacon said: ''Governors decided that as a fee-paying school we have
extended our kindness in allowing her to continue at the school.
''Even her A-level exam fees had to be paid by other parents. This is
the only thing we can do as a protest.''
One report last night said Mr Bacon eventually relented, and told the
pupil she had two A grades and a B.
The school is not naming the girl.
Dean Close was founded in 1886 by a former rector of Cheltenham and
Dean of Carlisle, the Very Rev Francis Close. He was known as the ''Pope
of Cheltenham'' and the school is proud of its religious tradition.
Founded as a boys' school, it used to give scholarships to the sons of
the clergy and Army officers.
Now it is a co-ed public school with fees at around #10,000 a year for
day pupils. It has 448 pupils in the 13-18 age group.

A FOOTBALLER who kicked a sailor's head as if it was a ball was jailed
for seven years at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday.
Andrew Sharkey, 18, a Partick Thistle second team apprentice striker,
landed such a ferocious kick that it killed nuclear submariner Graham
Liptrott in a Helensburgh street.
Sharkey and Donald Cullen, 22, had originally been accused of murder,
but the Crown accepted pleas to reduced charges.
Sharkey, of Kirkmichael Road, Helensburgh, admitted culpable homicide
and Cullen, of Adelaide Street, Helensburgh, admitted assault.
Lord Cameron sentenced Cullen to three months, backdated to the time
of his arrest, and he was freed.
The trial had heard that a disturbance was provoked by local youths
when some sailors based at Faslane appeared in West Clyde Street,
Helensburgh, on the night of April 28.
Sharkey forced Mr Liptrott to back up 35 to 40 yards along the
pavement while Cullen came up from behind him and punched him on the
side of the face.
As Mr Liptrott, who served with HMS Splendid, was falling, Sharkey
kicked him before he hit the ground.
There was so much force in the blow that it flipped Mr Liptrott up and
backwards.
Witnesses who did not know that Sharkey was a footballer described the
kick as like someone kicking a football.
As the youths ran away, Cullen shouted: ''Sailor bastard.''
The bones in Mr Liptrott's face, jaw, and nose were smashed by the
blow and he drowned in his own blood.
The rear of his head struck the pavement with such force that he was
severely concussed.
Mr Alistair Campbell, QC, defending Sharkey, who has had an offer from
an English club, said the player had suffered a momentary loss of
control with disastrous consequences.
Mr Campbell added: ''He accepts responsibility for the death and the
fact it was a serious crime. He is consumed with remorse.''
Mr Campbell said medical evidence was of the view that the injury
inflicted on Mr Liptrott would have been survivable if he had been taken
to hospital more quickly.
His client was a ''decent young man'' who had not been in trouble
before.
Sentencing Sharkey, Lord Cameron said he accepted he showed genuine
remorse for the tragedy and the way it had affected Manchester-born Mr
Liptrott's family.
Nevertheless, the judge referred to the fact that he had backed his
victim along the pavement and taken advantage of the attack by Cullen to
launch what he described as a ''most brutal blow''.

NEARLY a third of Britain is now covered by a hosepipe ban, mostly in
England, affecting around 17 million consumers.
Consumers in Fife region face a hosepipe ban next week after failing
to respond to appeals from the regional council to conserve water
voluntarily.
The regional council's depute director of engineering, Mr John
Shankly, said last night: ''We have had a publicity campaign to make our
residents aware of the situation but to be perfectly frank we have not
noticed any appreciable reduction in consumption.
''We have been trying to get over the message not to use hosepipes and
sprinklers and not to leave them running overnight. We have asked
everyone to make careful use of water. We made that plea well over a
week ago.''
The council launched a poster campaign yesterday but warned that what
it needed was a long period of good rainfall as a few showers would make
no difference.
In the Highlands, the regional council said it might have to extend
its existing hosepipe ban on Dingwall and the Black Isle to Badenoch and
Strathspey. However, the assistant director of water and sewerage, Mr
Stephen Harding, praised public compliance with appeals for restraint.
''If we had not taken precautions, there would be only 20 to 30 days'
supply left but, with the precautions taken, we aim to have about 50 to
60 days,'' he said.
In Strathclyde, however, the wet start to the year has left Loch
Katrine and Loch Lomond with higher levels than last year.
Recent appeals to residents in Eastwood to cut their consumption have
been prompted not by an actual shortage of water in Loch Katrine, which
serves Eastwood, but by extra demand lowering water pressure in the
pipes, said a council spokesman.
Nevertheless, residents in the Kilmarnock and Argyll areas will be
given leaflets next week asking them to ''go easy'' as they are served
by smaller local reservoirs.

<HEADLINE>UK troops in Gorazde pull out.  A retreat clears way for Nato war planes.</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976814218</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE UN troops, including British soldiers, are pulling out of the
besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde, the last ''safe haven'' in eastern
Bosnia.
Ukrainian forces started leaving yesterday, and the 190 men from the
Royal Welch Fusiliers will withdraw towards the end of next week,
according to defence sources.
They will be replaced by a handful of unarmed UN Military Observers
(UNMOs) and forward air controllers to direct Nato air strikes if
fighting erupts.
Hundreds of UN peacekeepers have pulled out of Muslim enclaves in
Bosnia in recent weeks, clearing the decks for a possible use of Nato
air power against the Serbs, and removing potential hostages and human
shields.
The Serb siege of Bihac, where UN troops from Bangladesh are deployed,
was broken by the Bosnian and Croatian armies two weeks ago, giving
peacekeepers a secure exit if needed.
A UN official said: ''Once the Brits and the Ukrainians are out of
Gorazde the hostage and human shield problems will be manageable. The UN
is slogging out of the quicksand of having troops behind Serb lines. The
question is whether air power will be effective.''
Nato and the UN say the rules of the game have now changed in Bosnia.
The mere threat of an attack will in future be enough to trigger a Nato
response, and it will be the response Nato has always wanted: widescale
strikes over a large area.
Britain announced more than two months ago it was not prepared to send
replacement troops to Gorazde after carrying out hazardous peacekeeping
operations there for two years. The mission has been one of the most
dangerous and arduous in the former Yugoslavia with troops cut off from
vital supplies for weeks on end.
The issue came to a head at the end of May when men from the Royal
Welch Fusiliers were kidnapped by the Bosnian Serbs. Although they were
released unharmed after more than two weeks in captivity, it
strengthened the resolve of the Government to pull out permanently.
Military officials said the remaining British troops in the enclave
would be able to start withdrawing towards the end of next week,
provided agreement is reached with the warring factions to use certain
routes.
The Royal Welch regiment is due to leave Bosnia next month, and the
replacement regiment, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, will be deployed
elsewhere in central Bosnia.
British officials denied the withdrawal would abandon Gorazde to the
surrounding Bosnian Serbs. ''We are content with the decision,'' said a
Government source. ''The UN is still there and Nato air assets are still
ready if needed.''
The West issued a stark warning to the Bosnian Serbs after the London
summit last month that even the threat of attack on Gorazde would bring
massive air strikes. It is clear the UN has decided now to protect the
enclave with such strikes.
''Troops on the ground were not a deterrent to attacks as we saw in
Srebrenica and Zepa, so we're going to use Nato now, based on new
agreements between them and the United Nations,'' said the UN.
UN spokesman Phil Arnold explained: ''It has now been said that a
threat may suffice . . . and it may not be restricted to the immediate
area surrounding the safe area in question.''
However, a new peace plan proposed by the US would give Gorazde to the
Bosnian Serbs in exchange for more territory around Sarajevo.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said the troop withdrawal was
sending ''confusion, contradiction and muddled messages both to the
Serbs and the Bosnians''.
Mr Ashdown said on BBC Radio 4's World at One that whether or not this
was a betrayal, depended on whether Britain was serious about the
undertakings given at the London Contact Group meeting last month
summoned by Mr Major: ''In particular, the clear message that we would
not tolerate the capture of Gorazde and to withdraw troops must lead the
Serbs to believe we are not serious about that undertaking.''

THE Tartan Army could run into major problems, including police road
blocks, if huge numbers of fans attempt to cross the Border for next
summer's European Championship finals in England.
Scotland has been classed as a foreign nation by UEFA, and only 7000
tickets per game will go on sale to Scots fans assuming the team
qualify, which now appears likely.
Supporters could find themselves turned back on the outskirts of
English cities if they do not have match tickets.
The fear is of a mix of large numbers of ticketless fans, alcohol, and
troublemakers in England triggering violence.
Mr Jim Farry, chief executive of the SFA, said he was unhappy at the
allocation, but the first priority was for Scotland to qualify. He said
the SFA may make an appeal for extra tickets but only on the basis that
the allocation would not compromise segregation and security at grounds.
Scotland's tickets will be made available solely to members of the SFA
travel club which at the moment has 3500 members. Any plea to UEFA for
extra tickets would depend on the number of members exceeding 7000, said
Mr Farry. ''I would imagine the numbers will swell if we qualify.''
More than 18,000 Scots travelled to Italy for the World Cup in 1990.
However, Scotland's claim for extra tickets could founder on the
determination to be treated as a separate nation in footballing terms.
Labour MP Brian Wilson, parliamentary adviser to the Scottish
Professional Footballers' Association, said any pleas would have to be
carefully worded.
''There is a separate Scottish entry on the basis of separate
recognition. I think common sense says that a way should be found to get
more tickets to Scotland. But I can understand the need for caution.''
Matches will be played at eight grounds: Wembley; Old Trafford,
Manchester; St James' Park, Newcastle; Hillsborough, Sheffield; Villa
Park, Birmingham; Elland Road, Leeds; and Anfield, Liverpool.
0 Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm George of Greater Manchester
Police, the officer in charge of co-ordinating policing for the
tournament, confirmed road blocks were being considered. ''I don't know
that that is what will be done, but that is the kind of thing I would
want to do here in Manchester.
''There are two reasons: If you have a lot of ticketless lads then I
don't want criminals selling to them, and secondly if they have no
tickets what are they here for? There is no reason.''
Mr George said he had been impressed by the Scots' behaviour in Italy
and at the last European Championship finals in Sweden, but said like
all fans who drank too much they could be vulnerable to provocation from
hooligans. ''When Scots travel they like to befriend people and consume
a certain amount of alcohol. The problem with this is that when people
consume too much alcohol they are easily manipulated.''
In England, where application forms for tickets are available at
branches of Barclay's banks, more than 320,000 tickets have been sold.
Tickets are available to domestic supporters only with applications
scrutinised on the basis of address but the English FA has conceded that
the system could be open to abuse.
The SFA's security adviser, Mr Willie McDougall, said he was aware of
the danger from fans buying tickets on the black market.
The prospect of attacks or provocation from English hooligans would be
dealt with by criminal intelligence and strong co-operation between
police forces on both sides of the border.
The draw to decide where teams will play will be made in December.

THE family of missing climber Alison Hargreaves have refused to give
up hope. They will continue to believe that she might appear back from
the world's most dangerous mountain K2 and ask what all the fuss has
been about.
Her husband Jim Ballard, 49, made this clear yesterday as he waited at
the Aonach Mor ski resort with their two children Tom, six, and Katie,
four, for definitive information from Pakistan where efforts to trace
the six missing climbers are continuing.
Pakistani authorities said a helicopter would go out to the mountain
today after poor weather conditions forced a similar operation to be
called off yesterday.
Mr Ballard rejected reports that the body of Ms Hargreaves had already
been spotted. He had been told that Sir Edmund Hillary's son Peter had
said he had seen what might have been a body but could not identify it
because he was using only binoculars.
''Obviously, the longer it has been since the first report that she is
missing the greater the odds that she will not come out unscathed. But
to me if there is no news by the end of Sunday that is the time that I
will start to close the book.''
If that happened, he would make no attempt to recover his wife's body.
''Alison never said it directly but I always took it to be that she
never wanted a rescue attempt. She knew her qualifications as a
mountaineer and if she couldn't get herself out there would be nothing
worth bringing off the mountain because the only thing worth having was
her spirit and that would be gone.''
Mr Ballard talked of how his two children had reacted to the news.
''Tom spent hours last night building an extremely complicated piece
of equipment out of technical Lego. That was his solution.
''Katie, she wanted just to cuddle and walk which we did in the
beautiful light last night as the sun set.
''The thing they are adamant about is they do want to see K2. And I
think it is important. I will think about it but I would very much like
to put together a small family team, perhaps with a couple of doctors,
and take the children as soon as possible when we finally know.''
Mr Ballard said he had already received financial offers from
newspapers and a television company to buy the rights of such a trip.
''If I can make it viable with enough control to feel happy in Alison's
memory, I will do it and do it fairly quickly.''
Mr Ballard read out a fax he had received yesterday morning from Sir
Edmund Hillary in New Zealand. In this, Peter Hillary described Ms
Hargreaves's determination to continue up the mountain, although he had
felt the conditions were unsafe. Peter Hillary and a Kim Logan decided
to go back. He doubted if many of those who went on could have survived.
Mr Ballard said: ''I would defend a decision to go on like a tiger
defends his cubs. If Alison felt it was right to go to the summit, no
matter what anybody else had said at the time, she would have gone.''
Mr Ballard did not feel angry that his wife's determination might have
left him alone with two children.
''I feel neither anger or regret. Alison and myself have been very
fortunate that we've been able to live our lives as we felt right.''
Yesterday the parents of Ms Hargreaves, John and Joyce, of Belper,
Derbyshire, said they had no regrets about their daughter taking up
climbing.
Mrs Hargreaves said: ''She has lived her life exactly the way she
wanted to live it.''

THE animator Richard Williams has seen one of his most cherished
dreams wither and die when the full-length film he had planned over the
years was taken out of his control by studio heads looking, as always,
at profit rather than artistic considerations.
The 62-year-old Canadian had sunk huge amounts of money into the
venture after the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit catapulted him to a
fame he had never sought. Now, while his film has been released Williams
won't watch it in its studio form and has abandoned any hope of
repeating his Rabbit success in Hollywood. Instead, he has decided to
spend more time on his other love -- playing jazz cornet.
Williams has been in London for the past month or more, partly as a
holiday and partly to see the musicians he worked with during the years
he spent in England. In that time he also fitted in a recording date,
the results of which will be available around the turn of the year.
But, after hearing the demo tapes the other week, Williams was
enthusing over the performances. ''This simply does not sound like a
British band,'' he told me. ''We have chosen good songs and mixed in a
few originals and all of us have been really happy with how the whole
thing has worked out.''
Williams's own personal preferences influence the repertoire heavily
with Bix Beiderbecke strongly represented with Waiting at the End of the
Road -- the last song Bix recorded with Paul Whiteman; I'll Be a Friend
With Pleasure and Bungalow of Dreams.
Typically, though, the versions Williams and his fellow musicians put
down are not slavish imitations of the Bix sides. He admits, for
example: ''Billy Butterfield made an album in the sixties some time, it
was called Billy Plays Bix and Bungalow of Dreams was on that and it was
Billy's version more than Bix's we thought about when we did our own
recording.''
While Bix was his earliest influence it was a 25-year-long friendship
with Max Kaminsky which allowed Williams to develop as an
instrumentalist.
Recalls Williams: ''I was just a teenager when I first met Maxie. My
father had a summer place on Nantucket Place and one year there as this
dance and a society band from Boston, Harry Marshard's Orchestra was
playing when suddenly I heard this trumpet on Fidgety Feet and I knew it
was Max -- that sound could not have belonged to anyone else.
''I spoke to him and asked what he was doing with this dreadful band
and he answered -- 'Making a living'. And that's exactly what he was
doing at that time. He had featured spots doing his own thing and I was
one of the few there that night who realised who he was and what he had
done in the jazz world.
''Anyhow, some time later I was working in New York and Max was at
Jimmy Ryan's and I went in there and he allowed me to sit in. I was
brash enough to do so and afterwards he was so encouraging.
''He told me that he had never seen anyone so desperate to play the
horn and then said he would give me lessons. But he would only do so if
I did exactly what he told me.
''It was hard work. He made me get the sheet music of the Dixieland
songs and learn them and only then would he allow me to try to
improvise. I had to have it all down correctly when I went to see him
and he taught me so much and he never once asked for money for the
lessons.''
''He died earlier this year and I spoke to him on the telephone and
though his voice was weak and he didn't sound great he told me: 'It has
been a terrific life' and I knew he meant that.''
Now the lessons have given Williams a release from the depression
which enveloped him as he lost his life's work to an unfeeling studio.
We will hear some of the results soon on his CD which promises to be an
amalgam of all that is best in the kind of free-wheeling jazz which
Williams has always favoured and which Kaminsky played with such
authority throughout his life.

<HEADLINE>Author attacks BBC for Thatcher funeral drama</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976814222</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE BBC was at the centre of a controversy last night over a political
thriller which portrays the state funeral of Baroness Thatcher.
The funeral sequence features in the opening of the new BBC drama The
Final Cut, based on the book by Michael Dobbs.
It stars Ian Richardson as the scheming Tory Prime Minister Francis
Urquhart, whose rise to power was traced in the two previous series,
House of Cards and To Play the King.
Mr Dobbs, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party and
novelist, said the funeral scene had been an addition of the BBC and
described it as ''appalling bad taste''.
Speaking last night at the Edinburgh Book Festival on the topic of
bestsellers and books adapted for TV, he admitted that writers had no
legal rights after their work was sold for TV adaptation.
''Broadcasters must have ultimate responsibility as they are legally
and morally responsible for what appears on the screen. I have no
argument with that. Most authors are very unwise about the ways of
television.''
He said he had expressed strong views over the adaptation of his work
but had no quibble with the TV treatment of House of Cards.
''I did have objections to changes in To Play the King but I could
understand why these changes were made.''
He said The Final Cut indulged in what many people would regard as
''appalling lapses of taste''.
Apart from the state funeral sequence which was not in the book,
Urquhart privately condemns Mrs Thatcher as a wicked and horrible woman.
The Falklands war is referred to in a derogatory manner and scenes set
in Cyprus have upset the British Army, who are portrayed as thugs
carrying out the Prime Minister's will. Mr Dobbs maintains that none of
this cynical emphasis was in the book.
''I fundamentally believe that all this nonsense gets in the way of
good drama, which should be about the development of character and plot
-- and not using a political drama to hang political prejudices on like
baubles on a Christmas tree.''
Mr Dobbs, 46, said: ''Drama should not be used for personal political
prejudice. I do feel very hurt that the BBC have chosen to use my book
as an example of this.''
Mr Dobbs was a personal aide to Mrs Thatcher and describes himself as
''a friend and adviser'' to the party.
A BBC spokesperson said: ''Michael Dobbs has been consulted throughout
the making of The Final Cut, although production is still incomplete as
the series is not due for transmission until late autumn.''
Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit described the scene depicting Lady
Thatcher's funeral as ''gratuitously offensive''. He said: ''But that's
what we would expect from the BBC drama department.''
Lord Tebbit added: ''I am sure that the BBC drama department would
have preferred it had Mrs Thatcher's funeral happened 20 years ago.''

FRENCH vineyards are all about wine, whereas Italian ones, in my
experience, are also about food. Therein, perhaps, lies an essential
difference between the two countries. In Italy, vineyards are more
likely to be interspersed with olive groves, cherry orchards, asparagus
fields, herb gardens. Cheese is not considered the enemy of wine. Meals
and tastings are more likely to overlap, the one enhancing the other, as
they did for me last month at a vineyard outside Verona. Though the aim
was naturally to show off the wine, the atmosphere was not too clinical.
Yet the grower, the poetically-bearded Count Serego Alighieri, had a
pedigree as imposing as that of any of his French rivals. Not many wine
producers, after all, can claim to be direct descendents of Dante, and
not many can quietly remark that their family has been making wine since
1772.
At his converted farmhouse, La Foresteria, we sipped the latest of his
white wines, a 1994 blend of local Garganega grapes -- the source of
gallons of nondescript Soave -- with Sauvignon Blanc, producing a
flavour hard to pin down but undoubtedly more Italian than French.
Then, moving to what was called ''The Canteen'', we sampled three
spectacular wines of steadily mounting intensity, while eating regional
dishes. Cookery classes are a feature of the establishment, which
operates as a peaceful, low-keyed hotel, surrounded by vines and
cypresses, within easy reach of Lake Garda.
Since linking himself with the ambitious Masi company of Verona, Count
Alighieri has been able to promote his wines more easily in Britain --
Oddbins now stock a few of them, as do Valvona &amp; Crolla in Edinburgh,
who sell the Alighieri Bianco for #5.99 -- and they provide ample proof
that good Valpolicella is a very different experience from the thin,
sharp stuff in two-litre bottles, bought by many Italian restaurants in
Britain as a cheap house red.
Traditionally the Alighieri family has used cherry wood or chestnut
casks in which to age its red wines. No doubt this contributes to the
zesty richness of the 1991 Valpolicella Classico Superiore (#6.49 from
Valvona &amp; Crolla) which seemed a perfect match for the grilled
aubergines in good olive-oil that launched the light and simple
four-course dinner. It went well, too, with the aromatic wild mushrooms
that followed, but if something weightier seemed required by the
subsequent hunks of pungent Italian cheese, the 1986 Amarone certainly
provided it.
Count Alighieri called it a wine ''in the baroque style'', and at a
lavish 16% proof it was suggestive of the massiveness of Wanda
Landowska's harpsichord playing. A wine like this is clearly not for
every day and some people might think it altogether too hefty to go with
food. Sampled in its own surroundings, however, it seemed just right,
it's fatness of flavour powerful enough to soften its edge of bitter
almonds.
Then, as at all Veronese feasts, came glasses of lusciously sweet,
dusky gold Recioto Amabile, the ideal accompaniment to fresh peaches and
the sort of Italian wine -- harvested as much as six months late, so
that the grapes possess ''noble rot'' -- about which we don't know
nearly enough in Britain. Vino Santo is what they call it in Verona, and
a bad sherrylike specimen can deter you for life.
Count Alighieri's, on the other hand, shows why it is known as a
''sipping and meditation'' wine. Its glowing overtones remained with me
throughout the subsequent performance of Aida at the Verona Arena.
* CONRAD WILSON visited La Foresteria under the auspices of the Magic
of Italy and Italian Escapades.

TERENCE CONRAN: The
Authorised Biography
Nicholas Ind
Sidgwick and Jackson, #25
THIS is not a book about the lives, loves and loathings of Sir Terence
Conran. It is an authorised biography, but there is little of the man
himself, which means there is no human touch. Conran is conspicuous by
his absence. In effect, Nicholas Ind has attempted to write a book about
a significant, British trail-blazer and succeeded in portraying him as a
caricature.
But you should not feel sympathetic. No-one buys a book for #25 out of
charity. What little information regarding Terence -- the man, not the
career -- the author compartmentalises like a social worker. Every
snippet about Conran's character, which he has gleened from friends or
acquaintances, he reports in a blank manner, and then refers back to a
childhood from whence the trait allegedly came. There is no added
thought, original or speculative, on how a person such as Terence Conran
has evolved. There is no overview.
The writing is turtle-like in its methodicalness. Terence Conran is a
designer who is self-made, not moulded by others, but smart and greedy
enough to take from them what he wanted. From the beginning of his
education, Conran grasped knowledge from those who knew more than he
did. He was not a great intellectual, but he was a hoover. He loved
learning then as he does now.
To be fair -- and why not? -- Terence Conran, the book, will tell you
all you need to know about his rise to the top. Short on psychology, but
long on fact, the biography is a piece of hard work to read and to have
written. However, there is the omnipresent suspicion throughout that Ind
has either not noticed what kind of man Conran is, or he hasn't met him.
Both excuses are equally damning. The former relays a lack of
imagination, and the latter shoddy research.
Terence Conran, the Authorised Biography, is an ideal book for
schoolkids sitting a Higher in art or design. Ind himself is a design
consultant and lecturer. He is the author of two other books, The
Corporate Image and Great Advertising Campaigns. It is his authority on
design which has qualified him to write on Conran, not his skill as a
biographer.
We learn that at 21, Terence Conran launched Conran and Company. He
was special. He gathered around him a set of educated, bohemian artists,
who were not as motivated as he was. He was the boss, he gave them jobs.
He set up cafes, he created furniture, he didn't hobnob with magazine
writers, he impressed them with his products first. Conran is a
smart-operator with a prize talent for manipulating those around him to
produce their best for his advantage.
It wasn't until he was fed-up with other people retailing his
furniture that he decided to go it alone. By early 1964, his new venture
had a name; habitat. From the outset the name was presented in lower
case letters. Typographically, this was an idea borrowed from Herbert
Bayer at the Bauhaus, an institute of contemporary German design.
Conran's view was that when entirely in lower case, words became more
legible and economic, and economy of design was his business.
The first Habitat shop attracted a high-profile clientele, the stars
of the ''me'' generation, including George Harrison, John Lennon, Lord
Snowdon, Julie Christie, Margot Fonteyn, and David Niven. Up until then,
Britain favoured only furniture and household goods which were
traditional, and there was little choice as to how a home could be
decorated.
The black pepper-mills, inspired by a spell living in France, the
saveloy kettles, seemed exotic and exciting to the public. The
previously insular British were also beginning to travel abroad for
their holidays more and more, and were becoming aware of other cultures.
Habitat appealed to a growing cosmpolitanism and a sense of
self-discovery. Conran was teaching a whole generation how to live.
To quote The Rise of Habitat Man, by John Hewitt: ''In this commodity
world, where you were what you bought, the problem was knowing what to
buy. Habitat resolved this problem. It took the guessing out of good
taste.''
Nowadays, Conran runs restaurants, where simple, classy cuisine is
sold in simple classy surroundings. To use that cliche, he is a genuine
style-guru. But being lauded for improving the quality of life for
people in Britain and Europe suggests his success was a mission. It
wasn't. The man refuses to live his life for anyone else.

WITH very few exceptions -- the atrocious The Hunger and the superb
Dracula's Daughter (1935 version) come to mind -- vampire movies have
always been presented and narrated from the perspective of the normal
folks whose lives the undead invade. Even in the exceptions, there's
little sense of what it's like to go through your unending unlife doing
the everyday vampire thing: get up in the evening, brush your fangs,
have someone round for supper, back in the box . . . heigh ho, so it
goes. Another day, another dolour.
Latest of the exceptions, Neil Jordan's Interview With The Vampire
(rental, cert 18), goes some way to repairing these omissions and
injecting a little psychological plausibility (plausibility? A vampire
movie? What are we saying?) into the story, a little sympathy for the
devil.
Aristocratic eighteenth-century New Orleans bloodsucker Lestat (Tom
Cruise) is always at the centre of the film, along with the plantation
overseer Louis (Brad Pitt) whom he has forcibly enlisted as a travelling
companion and fellow undeadnik, and we see everything through his jaded,
sated, warehouse eyes: bored, bored, bored. This vampire is a decadent,
high-camp Dorian Gray for whom every sensation palled centuries ago and
there isn't even a portrait in the attic he can stab; but he might as
well go through the motions of fun anyway: there's really nothing else
to do.
So he takes Louis along with him on the Grand Tour of Europe, where in
between the usual melodramatic adventures in catacombs and carriages
(beautifully and boldly filmed and art-directed: Neil Jordan isn't
afraid to be flamboyantly romantic), the two begin to resemble a
bickering old couple of antique-dealer drama queens on their holidays,
especially after they add a beautiful and innocent young orphan girl,
Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), to their menage and she comes to regard Lestat
as her mother. Da-da-da-da (click, click) They're creepy and they're
kooky/ Mysterious and spooky/ They're absolutely ooky/ The Vampire
Family . . .
All this inverted normality, however, doesn't mean that Jordan is
sending up the genre or Anne Rice's novel: shocks and scares are here in
plenty, though it's a film where atmosphere counts for more than
incident. The homoerotic sexual climate, for example, is extremely
perverse and seedy, though not in any ruttish or gratuitously nasty sort
of way, and the fourth principal character in the story is the death for
which Lestat (this film incidentally proves that Tom Cruise can act)
secretly longs. The keynote of the film is that wonderful line from the
1931 version with Bela Lugosi: Ah, to be really dead . . . that would be
glorious.
Just one more thing: don't let anyone who's seen it already tell you
the ending.
Cult corner: the late Rainer Werner Fassbinder's favourite films --
don't all run away, the guy was a genius -- were the lush, glamorous
emotional melodramas of Douglas Sirk, and one of the specialities of his
prolific career was to remake them without the glamour while keeping the
emotion.
Fear Eats The Soul (Connoisseur Video, retail, #15.99, cert 15) is his
1973 version of Sirk's All That Heaven Allows, in which the story of
wealthy widow Jane Wyman shocking the neighbours by falling in love with
her gardener, Rock Hudson, is transferred to 1970s West Germany in the
persons of a widowed charlady (Brigitte Mira), and her lover, a North
African immigrant worker (El Hedi ben Salem) doing his bit for the
German economic miracle. As a commentary on racism and hypocrisy, it's
stinging; as a human story, it's heartbreaking.

Catherine Brown looks at the trends behind the surge in soft drink
sales
FIZZY or still? Dilutable or pure juice? The choice of soft drinks is
no longer so simple as new flavour permutations, designed to attract the
adult market, hit the shelves. Clear-sparkling, fruit-cocktail,
iced-tea, herbal, fibre, and energy are the main newcomers whose novelty
-- and mystique? -- comes eye-catchingly packaged and expensively
promoted.
While cartons and PET (plastic) bottles are thought to be downmarket,
and cans mainly for the young, the sophisticated adult is being wooed by
the glass bottle.
According to the 1995 Sucralose Soft Drinks Report, authored by Zenith
International, the new developments are partly a result of last year's
good summer. Seven sweltering weeks between late June and early August
were responsible for a 5.2% increase in UK soft drinks consumption. In
the past 10 years, consumption has shot up by 53%, largely as a result
of an increase in bottled-water sales.
While the report believes that bottled water will continue to show the
fastest growth (sustaining a annual rate of about 10% and contributing
around 40% of the increase between 1994 and 2000) it also forecasts that
the new advertising budgets will ensure that new-flavour adult drinks
become firmly established.
Schweppes is backing Oasis with #4m and another million for Schizan.
Britvic has announced an allocation of #14m for Tango alone. This year's
Red Bull launch cost #5m, while the newest of the newcomers, Ribena
Juice and Fibre, is backed by #4m of promotional support. All in all,
the report estimates, there could be around #25m spent on promoting new
adult drinks in 1995.
But in the super league Coca-Cola remains the top UK sales-earner of
all manufactured food and drink, and is still the top flavour preference
in the soft drinks market.
Reputed to be doubling its total promotional spend to around #40m, it
has just launched Fruitopia in a chunky-friendly glass bottle with
#3.7m. A fruit-cocktail drink designed for the premium-price adult drink
market,
While Fruitopians are enjoying the buzz from such intriguing flavours
as Mind over Mango, Banana Vanilla Rapture, Tangerine Dream, and
Blackcurrrant Babylon, the clear-sparkling drinker is looking for relief
from the ultra-sugary, additive-loaded drinks, full of artificial
colourings, flavourings, preservatives, and stabilisers.
Clean, pure, natural, healthy, and non-alcoholic is the required
image. It was the pioneering herbal drink, Aqua Libra, which was the
first to attract this market for additive-free premium-price soft
drinks.
Yet however appealing the image of clear sparkling spring water with
natural flavourings, the ingredients list on some of the newcomers reads
differently. Caledonian Clear's Arctic Strawberry, for instance, lists:
Scottish Spring Water, Fructose, Carbon Dioxide, Citric Acid, Natural
Flavour, Preservative -- Sodium Benzoate.
There at least four ways that a fruit flavour can be created in a soft
drink: from the juice extracted from the fruit; from a fruit juice
concentrate (single-strength juice evaporated to a concentrate which is
then usually flavoured with essence oils to restore the flavour); from
artificially created synthetic chemicals; or from nature-identical
chemicals.
While the first two methods can claim to contain real fruit flavour,
both the other methods use a chemical flavour produced in a laboratory.
When the chemical is synthetic it must be labelled ''artificial'' but
where nature-identical chemicals are used it can be labelled
''natural''.

Actress Barbara Rafferty (right) lives in Glasgow with her husband
Peter, her daughter aged 23 and her two sons aged 20 and 15.
* I COOKED for my family for 20-odd years and brought them up on
Scottish food that my mother taught me like cutlets or totties and
mince, porridge in the morning, and arrowroot. I hate food shopping --
it can get claustrophobic with everyone charging into you with trolleys
-- but my husband likes it although I like delis. I loved the
old-fashioned shops.
Now I'm working, my husband Peter does most of the cooking in our
home. He's very good at curries, Chinese, and roasts. I make Italian, I
love it, it's full of nourishment. My favourite is tagliatelle
carbonara.
When I'm working in theatre, my stomach seems to close up after a
certain time. If I'm in Glasgow I'll buy ready-made food and microwave
it. But I'm usually en route to the theatre when I should be having my
tea. When I get home after the performance I'm too tired to eat, but I
try and have pasta or a baked potato to keep me going.
If I'm filming I'll start the day with a glass of water -- I'm not
hungry at six o'clock in the morning. My favourite location nibble is a
roll filled with black pudding and scrambled egg but usually I'll have
fruit and a yoghurt.
Sundays off -- it's gorge-time! A lovely late fry-up with tottie
scones, fried bread, everything! . . . sprawled out with the Sunday
papers. Then I'll wait till tea time -- a full roast of silverside,
roast potatoes, carrots, peas. I rarely have a notion for puddings but
have a banana or orange. I like fruit -- for breakfast too -- and if
there's melon, strawberries or plums at the Barrow on Byres Road I'll
buy it. I adore cheeses, especially French.
Sometimes I'll drink hot chocolate, or Horlicks or a chamomile tea --
or a dry white wine. I love Mersault but it's too dear, I rarely buy it.
And I don't like coffee or tea very much, but Japanese or Chinese teas
without milk are very refreshing. I could live on Japanese food, with
sake. All that fish, seaweed and rice looks so dainty. As a treat, I
like eating out at Moshi Moshi, and at the Cul de Sac for the ambiance.

Poet, performer and writer Liz Lochead (right) tells ANN DONALD what
books she's reading for her own entertainment
* I'M reading three collections of short stories, all by Scottish
authors. The first one I received as a present in the post from the
author James Robertson and is called The Ragged Man's Complaint. It's
the first time I've read his work and it's wonderful -- I'm really
enjoying it. He writes terrific stories which are all very different
from each other but with a very strong and distinctive voice. He writes
great dialogue in Scots which is also very contemporary.
The other is Alan Spence's latest collection called The Stone Garden
and that's brilliant. It's been a very long time since his last
collection so I'm appreciating this now. Alan is exactly the same age as
I am and he's captured so many things about the sixties -- about the
people then and how they are nowadays. In all of the stories there is
some sense of epiphany, a moment of acceptance even in the hardest of
circumstances. They are all exquisitely and beautifully written stories.
And the other contemporary collection is by Alison Smith called Free
Love which is absolutely wonderful.
I'm also reading The Shipping News by Annie Proulx. I'm enjoying it
but there's something about it that annoys me. I think it's because
there is lots of fine writing in it like ''so-and-so woke up from an
aubergine-coloured dream''. What the hell is that all about?
I have reading spates and I'll go to the loo for half an hour to read.
Whenever I do get really involved in a book then apparently no-one can
talk to me because I just look up and say ''Mmm?'' in a vague way and
don't even notice I've done it.

ANDRE MALRAUX -- A BIOGRAPHY
Curtis Cate
Hutchinson, #25
IT is difficult to take against a man who could come up with the
aphorism that ''Tourism is to travel what prostitution is to love''.
Such precision and elegance we naturally ascribe to the French mind,
just as we ascribe to it less pleasant qualities: arrogance, egotism,
general obnoxiousness. It is a measure of Andre Malraux's quintessential
Frenchness that he possessed the whole gamut of these qualities in full
measure.
Malraux could scarcely have been conceived of in any country but
France, an avant-garde novelist who rose to be one of the great men in
the state. No doubt it helped rather than hindered him that his books,
to my taste at least, are hard to read, full of objectionable characters
moving through fragmentary worlds evoked rather than created.
The only one I ever enjoyed was Les chenes qu'on abat, a series of
supposedly remembered but patently invented conversations with General
de Gaulle, safely published after he was dead.
It was on the general's coat-tails that Malraux rose to be an arbiter
of culture, in an unlikely association. By the standards of a
conservative aristocrat the novelist's earlier life had been shady.
To whatever literary distinction he had gained, he added that of being
a convicted criminal, having gone out to the French colony of Cambodia
to vandalise ancient temples and then flog off the sculptures he stole.
At this he was hilariously incompetent. In the 1930s he drifted into the
Communist Party and fought in the Spanish Civil War.
That at least left him no choice when the Germans conquered France in
1940. He joined the Resistance, and here showed a good deal of bravery.
It was enough, after the liberation, to make de Gaulle interested in
him.
They met and had a conversation which the general opened in his usual
lapidary style: ''D'abord, le passe.'' Malraux correctly took this as an
invitation to explain himself and talked non-stop for a long time,
fixing shrewd assessments of de Gaulle's political enemies with
intellectual references to Marx, Victor Hugo, Michelet, Clausewitz, and
so on. These, as Cate puts it, were ''served up as naturally as if
Malraux had been conversing with Andre Gide at some literary
get-together''.
The general listened in silence, then gave him a job.
Cate offers no convincing account of this strange conversion. Being,
it appears, an American born in Paris, he has both his own people's lack
of a sense of irony, and a (perhaps excessive) reverence for the
cultural superiority of the French. Some more of the one and less of the
other would have put his subject more firmly in his place.
It may be gratuitous to say so, but I think a British author could
have done a better job.
However outrageous Malraux's behaviour, it seldom moves Cate to much
more than the painstaking recording of events. The conversion to
Gaullism was not particularly astute, in that it took years to pay off.
But when it did, after the general's return from the wilderness in 1958,
it paid off very handsomely indeed. He made Malraux his Minister of
Culture
Though Malraux had to spend an inordinate amount of energy on
squabbles over the directorships of opera houses, he could also embark
on the grandiose projects beloved of the Presidents of the Republic, and
invent wonderful freebies for himself.
One was to take the Mona Lisa from the Louvre to be exhibited in
Washington DC. For this, he assured John F Kennedy and his wife Jackie,
''may both of you be praised, in the name of all the unnamed artists who
thank you, perhaps from the depths of funereal night''.
By this, I suppose that the artists he had in mind were dead, though
why dead anonymous artists should thank the Kennedys for bringing the
Mona Lisa to America is not, to this reviewer at least, altogether
clear. But this egregious piece of vacuous pretence is reported in the
same deadpan manner as all the rest.

It has everything
I need, she tells Beverley Brown
* WHEN Liz White's husband died in 1989, she decided to sell their
large Victorian town house in North Berwick. But prospective buyers were
advised to ignore the double garage situated at the end of the garden.
With a startling transformation in mind, this was not included in the
sale of the house. Instead, it was designated to become a house.
A year or so earlier, Liz's architect husband Frank had drawn up plans
to convert the garage into a home for their daughter Jane. The plans
were never put into action -- until Liz found herself looking for a
smaller, easy-to-manage home and remembered Frank's drawings. Minus the
garage, the family home was sold and Liz found temporary accommodation
in the nearby village of Longniddry, while builders went to work,
transforming an ordinary garage into an extraordinary home.
Work was completed within nine months. As the house and garage were
listed, East Lothian's planning officials couldn't allow the garage to
be increased in height or diameter, which ruled out the small
conservatory Liz would have liked at the front where she has since
managed to turn the narrow strip of space available into a tiny patio
area surrounded by colourful pot plants. Dormer windows at the front and
rear were permissible and now jutt out from the red, pan-tiled roof,
making it a two-storey home.
Frank's architectural drawings were altered slightly to give Liz an
additional tiny washroom/toilet upstairs in what was proposed to be a
wardrobe and storage area. And a supporting pillar from the original
garage caused a minor hiccup, as space had to be taken away from the
dining area built around it, to allow room for the bath to be squeezed
in next door.
The end result is a home with a triangular-shaped kitchen, a sitting
room with dining area at one end, and an angular downstairs bathroom
with a magnificent roll-top bath. Upstairs, via an enclosed spiral
staircase, is the tiny washroom/toilet and Liz's bedroom which, like the
sitting room downstairs, has a window at each end of the room. There's
even a tiny guest bedroom, although Jamie, Liz's nine-year-old English
setter, has adopted this as his room -- and there's plenty of room for
him to stretch out on the futon which sits beneath a large, sloping
velux window!
''At the planning stages I can remember thinking 'this will never
work, it's far too small','' says Liz. ''But now I just love it. It has
everything I could ever need and it's easy to look after -- which is
what I set out to find in the first place.''
There are two striking aspects to this minuscule home: one is the
amount of light that the builders have managed to incorporate by
cleverly adding windows in all the right places; the other is entirely
due to Liz's professional interior design skills (she works part-time at
Hamilton House in Gullane). The colour scheme throughout the house is
different shades of blue, yellow and white. Bold, Mediterranean colours
which beautifully complement Liz's many china collections.
In the kitchen, Kaffe Fassett wallpaper with its sunshine yellow
background covered in blue jars, is the perfect foil for Liz's
collection of blue and white ginger jars that she couldn't bear to part
with when she moved from the family home.
Plain white units, paintwork and flooring and bright blue and white
gingham curtains, make the most of this small kitchen. In the
sitting/dining room, plain blue walls with splashes of yellow in the
curtains and furnishings, are the perfect backdrop for Frank's many
paintings. The solid beech floor is echoed in beech furniture and
shelving and Liz has a white, gas-powered, log-burning stove.
''This room was originally all white and deliberately Scandinavian in
style,'' she says. ''But then I decided to experimint with colour and
try out different textures and patterns. During the day the effect is
sunny, warm and inviting but it's really a night-time house -- after
dark the colours just glow.''
The bathroom's size is visually enhanced by blue and white vertically
striped wallpaper and accessories, and the colour scheme continues
upstairs with the emphasis changing from room to room. Liz's bedroom is
furnished in pine and with its sloping walls and patchwork quilt on the
bed, looks as if it belongs in a country cottage. ''The bed had to be
constructed in the room as we would never have got it through the front
door, let alone up the stairs.''
Six years ago Liz had despaired of finding a smaller house that would
enable her to continue living in North Berwick where she has been for 25
years. Yet the perfect solution was at the bottom of the garden all
along.

Knocker, knocker,
who's there? A
family of real
elegance. . . or
not? The look of
your front door can
tell the world all
about you, says
KENNEDY WILSON
* IT IS a little-known fact that there are two identical doors for No
10 Downing Street, each made of solid, armour-plated bomb-proof steel.
When the door needs to be repainted or repaired, it is simply taken off
its hinges and replaced with its twin. Ordinary home-owners hardly need
to go to such lengths, but there are many ways of presenting the door
and a huge range of knobs, knockers and letterboxes -- ''door
furniture'', as they call it in the trade.
The first impression people have when they come to your home is the
front door. But while home-owners lavish care and attention of the style
of their main rooms, their conservatory, even the inside of their
garage, many don't bother too much with their front door. Yet the door
and its knob, letterbox, kick plate, knocker, and doorbell buttons can
say a great deal about the style and elegance of the people who live
inside.
The front door has two main messages -- it should give the impression
of security and strength (to put off burglars) but at the same time be
welcoming (to impress guests). The first priority is security. A front
door should have at least one heavy mortice lock to provide serious
back-up to a standard Yale. It is a good idea to have a security chain
to prevent the door being opened more than a few inches.
There's nothing worse than a scruffy front door with mismatched
handle, knocker and numerals. Fortunately, there is a huge choice
available. Knobs and Knockers has branches nationwide. McKinney &amp; Co has
an exclusive range of fine door furniture such as doorknobs, bellpulls
and keyhole covers. It is surprising the effect created by the simple
act of installing a striking door knocker. The bland face of the door
acts as a perfect foil for carefully-chosen items. A lion's head door
knocker, for example, instantly gives a door distinction.
If you're selling a house, the front door is the first thing
prospective buyers see, so it ought to be given a fair deal of
attention.
One crucial element is to harmonise letterboxes, doorknobs and door
numbers. Avoid cheap and flimsy metal letterbox surrounds. It is best to
invest in quality materials that look good and will not deteriorate in
the Scottish winter. Knobs &amp; Knockers, for example, produce door
furniture in a range of quality materials including virgin brass.
Another factor you have to consider is the door's colour. Downing
Street-style black imparts an aura of impressive authority and dignity,
but might appear to be too funereal for a private home. Dark colours
such as burgundy or navy blue are good colours to give an appearance of
dignified restraint.
White looks especially good when the door has brass fittings. The
combination of pure white and shining brass creates a fresh yet simple
entry to the home. For a more cheerful front door, bright colours such
as scarlet, orange or yellow make an immediate impact. But sometimes
neighbours could object to a dazzlingly colourful front door.
The owner of a house in Bath's dignified Royal Crescent was taken to
court to force her to repaint her canary yellow front door a more sedate
colour, and it is difficult to imagine a shocking pink front door
finding favour among the douce residents of Edinburgh's New Town.
* Knobs &amp; Knockers has branches up and down the country. The Edinburgh
and Glasgow Architectural Salvage Yards (EASY) sell original fixtures as
well as replacement doors -- EASY, Unit 6, Couper Street, Leith (0131
554 7077) and 85-87 Colvend Street, Glasgow (0141 556 7772). McKinney &amp;
Co is located at 1 Wandron Road, London (0171 384 1377).

* SCOTLAND basking under azure skies, broiling and blistering under
brassy Phoebus. Has it been a dream? Maybe: we'll have to wait until
next summer to find out.
But the sun has a curious effect on people who aren't used to it. In
summer's past, we have seen you arriving back at Glasgow Airport, tanned
and relaxed, after a fortnight smeared in Factor 8. You were an idiot.
You came back wearing a T-shirt and shorts, sandals and naught else save
a heavy carry-out from the duty-free. A litre of grappa, or something
equally ridiculous. You had the bizarre delusion that the idyll would
continue: that here in Scotland, the sun's burning heart would continue
to sustain you.
Maybe the first warning was that the family or friends who came to
meet you, harassed by parking restrictions, were wearing long johns and
overcoats. ''A bit parky the night,'' they said, for that was a typical
Scottish August. ''Whit?'' you replied. There hadn't been enough time to
make the transformation, and your fortnight in the sun charged you like
a battery with the warmth of eternal optimism. You'd forgotten the icy
fingers of the east wind and couldn't remember how to spell sleet.
But this year you came back to something else: a country as hot and
parched as anything in the Aegean. In this euphoric condition, maybe,
you decide to remodel your house and garden. You want tiled floors and
throw-rugs, headache-inducing wallpaper and louvred shutters. You want
the cleansing winds to whisper gently through your living spaces,
dispelling the heat and the humidity. Above all, you want a
Mediterranean garden, like that one you saw perched on a terrace above
the Amalfi Coast: a place of olive trees where you can sit in the gentle
breezes of the cool evening, gently running a finger over the dew-beads
on your glass of chilled Venezian white . . .
I empathise, I really do. But haven't you forgotten something? Your
beloved homeland is a place where the gentle breeze will normally freeze
your pants off, and where your olive trees will give one shriek and
expire. That's called reality.
When the Italians come in the other direction to discover the
seductive charms of Scotland, do they return to Naples wearing three
layers of underclothing and a deerstalker hat? Will they put Alpine
plants in their parched gardens, and install a peat fire in their humid
living rooms? Are they as deranged as you?
Listen: redesign your garden and remodel your house by all means: but
check the central heating first, and don't bank on sitting outside in a
T-shirt drinking bianco. Next summer could be another story. I assume
you remember how to mix a hot toddy?

* APENN Fabrics has brought out a new range of designs (hand-printed
on to cotton and linen), based on antique French documents discovered at
remote French museums and antique shops, by the original owners of
Apenn.
The Tivoli collection is based on a curtain dated around 1780 that was
brought from a Brocante fair in France and the Chelworth echoes the
Oriental theme of tea-drinking which was a newly fashionable pursuit in
Europe at the time.
Prices from #27 per metre of 100% cotton, to #37.50 per metre for
linen. Scottish stockists are available from Apenn Fabrics on 0171 792
2457.
* IF you regularly lament the speed with which you romp through
detergent for the family wash, a new liquid, four times as concentrated
as normal, could be of interest.
Jonelle 4xConcentrated comes in 500ml plastic bottles and in three
options: Automatic Biological; Non-Biological -- for sensitive skins and
containing no perfumes or enzymes; and Colourcare Biological, for
coloured fabrics, which contains no added bleach or optical brightening
agents.
The 500ml bottle provides enough liquid for the same number of washes
as two litres of standard liquid detergent, and costs a very competitive
#2.75. It's stocked by John Lewis, Edinburgh.
* ENVIRONMENTAL consultant Douglas Boyle of Crieff has found a good
way of re-using broken wooden pallets. He repairs them and makes a
composting bin, with fencing stobs to keep the pallets upright.
A broken pallet is also put in the ground, as an air inlet. Shredded
garden waste can be composted in the bins and makes an ideal organic
fertiliser.
* A CLEVER innovation is IKEA's kitchen bench which doubles as a
storage unit for dry household waste. The bench is the perfect solution
for anyone who feels guilty about throwing everything into the bin but
doesn't have the space to save their sorted rubbish -- underneath the
lid, which forms the seat, is room for three bins. Perfect for storing
waste to be recycled. The bench unit costs #110 and the accompanying
storage crate #19.

Tying the knot? Think about doing it in white satin streamers,
suggests Leila Aitken
* WEDDING dresses, three-tier cakes and bridal posies are much in
evidence in many a high street window at the moment, writes LEILA
AITKEN, and many a home is in the traditional frenzy that comes with a
summer wedding.
An extra pair of hands will be welcome in the middle of wedding
preparations, so here's an idea to help out with the wedding flowers and
add a touch of brightness to the wedding day.
Although the decoration of the important areas with traditional
flowers is best left to an expert florist, there is no reason why you
can't make a valuable contribution by arranging flowers elsewhere.
Make a pair of floral ''trees'' with white satin ribbon streamers.
They are relatively easy to create and, placed one each side of the
porch at the church door, or at the entrance of the hotel for the
reception, look very attractive and welcoming.
Two trees can also transform a rather sombre driveway and look very
pleasing in the wedding photographs.
To make the foundation for the tree you will need:
A flower pot 18cm diameter; ready-to-mix sand and cement from a
hardware shop; a straight thick branch about 1.2 metres long (or a broom
handle); an oasis ball 20cm in diameter from a florist; florist's tape;
2.5 metres each of white satin ribbon and white organdie ribbon 3cm
wide; coloured pebbles and an outer flower pot 32cm across.
Make a firm paste of the sand and cement and water. Wedge the branch
between a few large stones so that it stands in the centre of the
smaller pot. Fill the pot with the cement and leave to set for 24 hours.
The reason for using two pots is that when the tree needs to be
transported it will weigh less if it is permanently fixed in a fairly
small pot. The finished tree is placed in the second, larger pot to give
stability and also to make it look balanced and not top-heavy.
Soak the oasis ball and push it about 8cm down on to the top of the
branch. Wind a criss-cross of tape twice around ball and branch to
secure it.
For the flower ball you will need:
Flowers: single white chrysanthemums and gypsophila.
Foliage: variegated privet; skimmia or bay.
Cut all the foliage into sprigs 10cm in length. Insert sprigs of
privet around the ball so that it is loosely covered. Add sprigs of bay
or skimmia between the privet. At this stage very little of the oasis
should still be showing.
Cut the chrysanthemum heads to 12-13cm long. Add these all round the
ball. Cut the gypsophila into small sprays about 15cm long and add these
only when you are satisfied with the shape of the flower ball.
Stand the ''tree'' in the outer pot. Disguise the cement with coloured
pebbles and tie the ribbons and a bow just beneath the ball.
Finally, spray the flower ball with tepid water to help the flowers
last well.
After all the time spent making the foundation tree, keep it to use at
Christmas to make a decorative holly ball with red ribbon streamers to
stand at the front door. You will need to buy a new oasis ball as oasis
cannot be resoaked once it has dried out. Red spray carnations and ivy
leaves will go well with holly.
Meanwhile, you can make use of the existing ball, once it has dried
out completely, to make a display of dried flowers to stand in a hall or
porch. Cut a selection of dried flower heads to the same measurements as
above. Choose flat-faced flowers such as helichrysum and pointed shapes
such as statice and use velvet ribbon, to tone with the colour scheme,
for the streamers.

* THE tiny Dumbartonshire village of Dumgoyne has been put firmly on
the horticultural map by 76-year-old Ronnie Gibb and his young
neighbour, John McNight.
Their superb roadside show of colour -- in hanging baskets, containers
and borders -- is a real eye-catcher and has tourists from all over the
world stopping to take photographs of it.
Ronnie and John raised all the plants in their greenhouses, with
top-quality compost and seed. They nurtured the plants for setting out
in May. But things don't just happen. The exotic display demands 90
minutes of watering every morning, seven days a week. In warm weather,
it takes up the evenings too.
The plants' performances are carefully monitored. Seed orders for next
year are already provisionally made up . It includes the plants which
have done well this year -- such as brachycome or Swan River daisy,
calendula or Scotch marigold, fuchsias, geraniums, lobelia, nasturtium,
petunia, asters, verbena and pansies.
Ronnie, a retired electrical engineer, has lived in the area for more
than 30 years and has always been keen on gardening. This year, the
summer weather ''brought things on a treat'', he says.
In building up their partnership, Ronnie and John admit to a few minor
disagreements on odd items; but their teamwork has prevailed is now
paying dividends.
Tourist buses constantly pull up to have a look at the arresting show
that fronts the neighbours' row of white-painted cottages.
But it will regrettably come to an end all too soon. Dumgoyne lies at
the bottom of a valley and can often be caught with early frosts . . .

Will the content
and character
of our garden
change if our
summers are
tobe hotter?
asks IAN WALLS
* IF OUR SUMMERS are going to be hot, there will need to be a changed
attitude to gardening. Closely mown lawns will be a thing of the past:
let grass grow a bit lanky. Unless you are prepared to water
continually, and are permitted to do so.
With very high temperatures, plants are left crying out for moisture.
Many gardeners have turned to watering systems. If you want to go the
whole hog, computers can organise things for you.
It is interesting to observe what plants have best survived, and make
a note for next season.
Alyssum, lobelia and antirrhinum have been ousted by sun-lovers such
as busy Lizzies and begonias. Even begonias are starting to suffer in
the sun.
Lobelia have held their place in containers and hanging baskets. It
has also been a good year for petunias. Geraniums don't seem to mind dry
roots either.
Soft fruit has fared remarkably well with little loss due to rain. In
the vegetable section, crops have done reasonably well with heavier
types of land.
Most established shrubs do not seem to have fared too badly, although
there have been disasters with container stock set out in spring and not
adequately watered. The problem is that death due to drying out can be
delayed. The plant survives on internal sap. When this is used up, there
can be severe die-back.
One sphere of continuing activity is in pests and diseases.
Caterpillars are now munching their way through crops and black spot is
making inroads to roses not regularly sprayed.
* IF YOU HAVE NOT had a good fruit year, this is the moment to do
something about it.There is no better time to start with strawberries.
They are best rotated around the garden. If you grow them year after
year in the same plot, yields will deteriorate.
Check that the ground is free from weeds. Dig in plenty of well-rotted
farmyard manure or garden compost. Give a scatter of a fertiliser such
as National Growmore. It is best to buy in virus-free stock from a
reliable source. A good all-round variety is Elsanto; or you could try
Tamella or Mara des Bois.
Plant about 10 to 12in apart, in rows 30 to 36in apart. You could do
worse than use the black polythene mulch system. Lay it down with earth
lapped round the edges. Insert plants through the polythene, making good
root contact with the soil.
Some gardeners like to plant strawberries in barrels, which do not
take up too much room. You can buy special plastic barrels or get hold
of an old whisky barrel and bore holes in the side.
Netting to prevent bird damage is usually a must in the garden. Do it
tent fashion over a row of stakes with string. Otherwise, birds simply
peck through netting placed over plants.
Why not pot up a few strawberry plants now, winter them out of doors,
and bring them into an unheated greenhouse in the early spring? You will
be amazed how successful this can be.
A good source of strawberry-plant supply is Ken Muir, Honeypot Farm,
Rectory Road, Weeley Heath, Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Tel: (01255) 830181.
* SO WHAT ABOUT other sources of good information for gardeners in
Scotland? The three agricultural colleges, now amalgamated, have more or
less opted out of the garden advice business.
The gap has been filled, to some extent, by local authorities. Some
run ad hoc advisory services, and have demonstration gardens.
The new Beechgrove Garden site is, of course, an excellent source of
knowledge and demonstration. And one can look, too, at the Scottish
Gardens Scheme, under which more than 300 gardens are opened to the
public. This is only a fraction of the many places the public can enjoy,
if only in a passive role.
There are changes, though. Glasgow Botanical Gardens have a
highly-qualified young lady, Louise Bustard, who provides a link with
the public, including organised tours.
The Royal Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh can be an excellent source of
information -- if at a level somewhat above the average gardener -- as
are the gardens at Ben More and Port Logan, and the many National Trust
gardens.
Dare I say, however, there is a more enlightened attitude to education
south of the Border? Harlocar, the garden of the Northern Horticultural
Society, has been planned and developed expressly to help amateurs.
Although Scotland does not fare too badly, do we need a super garden,
a garden of excellence, supported by education establishments,
horticultural societies and the industry itself? The Keukenhof Gardens
in Holland are gardens supported by the industry. It is a great pity the
Festival Garden in Glasgow was allowed to go. It was magnificent.
Gardeners are pretty well served by radio, TV and publications. There
is still nothing quite like the personal visit for expert on-the-spot
advice.
I have long thought that we have a huge latent bank of knowledge and
experience in Scotland -- with so many retired lecturers, gardeners, and
horticulturists generally. If this talent could be co-ordinated into a
garden advice service, it would serve Scottish gardeners well.

* WITH the price of fertilisers escalating like everything else, do
not throw away valuable household refuse and vegetable waste from the
garden, writes Ian Walls.
Anything organic -- cabbage and lettuce leaves, tea leaves, potato
peelings, and even old newspapers -- can all be rotted down to make
valuable compost.
Find a sheltered spot in the garden, and with old wood or wire netting
make up a ''bin''.
Spread some branches on the base, which should be an earth floor, and
then pile in the refuse. Every few inches add some compost maker which
you can buy in a garden shop.
Keep the heap covered from rain and before long you will have lots of
rich organic food, which you fork into the soil to feed your crops.

At home with the author . . .
Leila Aitken visits Nigel Tranter
at his fascinating house in Aberlady
* NIGEL Tranter's home is, like the author, intensely interesting,
steeped in history and a delight to visit. Glimpsed from the shore road
at the Aberlady Bay in East Lothian, it looks at first like a pleasantly
secluded stone cottage; but turn into the gravel drive and there is no
visible entrance and it is a relief to see a small sign -- ''door'' --
fixed to the stonework, with an arrow indicating the direction to walk.
Round the corner is a glass porch and a second notice next to a school
hand-bell: ''For attention please ring this bell.'' I do just that and
Nigel Tranter appears, sprightly and welcoming.
Once we are settled in the small sitting-room, Nigel Tranter, master
story teller and historian, explains the fascinating history of his
home.
''This house forms part of the Luffness Estate -- it doesn't belong to
me. I leased from the laird with an agreement sealed simply with a
handshake 46 years ago. Part of it was the quarryman's cottage -- the
medieval quarry is in the grounds, along with the ruins of the first
Carmelite monastery built in Scotland.
''Its ruined chapel is visible from the house along with the effigy of
Sir David de Lindsay, who died in the Crusades. The stone was also used
for the nearby original twelfth-century castle.
''In 1746, the Laird of Luffness was deeply offended by the blacksmith
who gave preference to the Earl of Wemyss horses and left the laird in
the middle of the job. He vowed never to use that blacksmith again and
he built a smiddy of his own. He stuck it on to the quarryman's house,
so the other wing of this house was the smiddy. You can still see the
hood which was originally the forge, it has a wonderful draught. We
added the Adam mantelpiece when we came here.
''Earlier tenants knocked the two houses into one and added what's
called the garden room. It's a draughty large wooden extension, built to
accommodate his wife who had tuberculosis!
''We added an upstairs room with windows all round because we had no
view of the bay. We use it a good deal in the summer.''
Nigel Tranter's enthusiasm for historic properties is not limited to
his own home. Over the years, he has been instrumental in restoring over
64 fortified houses in Scotsland, including Aiket in Ayrshire, Castle
Levan in Renfrewshire and Spedlins Castle in Dumfries. Plean Castle near
Falkirk is undergoing restoration at the moment.
He explains: ''All fortified houses tend to be called castles and they
have always held a great fascination for me. There were thousands of
them in the mid-seventeenth century. They were built as homes --
defensible homes. Although some are reduced to only heaps of stones, 663
remain with the outline and principal features intact.
''I've written five volumes depicting them all (The Fortified House in
Scotland, Mercat Press) and because of this I am constantly asked for
the whereabouts of a castle in need of restoration.''
Nigel Tranter ruefully admits he has difficulty both counting and
housing all the other books he has written -- ''Well over a hundred'' --
and points out the bookcase sagging under the weight of all his titles.
His latest, Highness in Hiding, was published last month (by Hodder and
Stoughton at #15.99) to mark the 250th anniversary of the Jacobite
rising.

Pirates really did wear scarves around their heads like Andre Agassi
Life Among The Pirates. The Romance And The Reality
David Cordingly, Little Brown, #18.99
THIS is an entertaining book with a major and minor theme. The major
theme is a sobersided history of pirates in the Caribbean c.1650-1720;
the minor is the relationship between actual pirates such as Captain
Kidd, Blackbeard, Henry Morgan, William Dampier and others and their
fictional and celluloid doppelgangers. In the latter category are, most
famously, Long John Silver, Captain Hook, Douglas Fairbanks, and Erroll
Flynn.
When elaborating the major theme, the book faces two ways: towards a
popular audience and a scholarly one. The popular side is often very
well done, as Cordingly disentangles fact and fiction. Pirates really
did wear scarves or bandannas around their heads in the manner of Andre
Agassi; they did maroon people on desert islands; they did bring back
exotic birds as souvenirs of their travels, especially parrots, which
were colourful and could be taught to speak; they did go armed to the
teeth, if only because their guns were of the one-shot variety. Also,
flintlock pistols were unreliable at sea and, if one failed to fire
because of a damp charge, a second might do the job.
The scholarly side of the book is a disappointment. A chapter on
storms and shipwrecks promises more than it delivers. I would have liked
more on the quality of the pirate captains' seamanship: how good were
they at running before the wind, how often did they ''broach to'', what
kinds of calamitous high seas did they actually survive, and so on.
Professor Burg of Arizona has recently (and convincingly) argued that,
given the tiny numbers of women in the Caribbean c.1650-1720, sexual
life in a pirate community must have been akin to that in a modern
penitentiary: that is to say, rampantly homosexual. Cordingly does not
like this argument, but his way of dealing with it is touchingly naive.
His beloved pirates must have been ''lusty womanisers'' and ''vigorously
heterosexual''. He even adduces that old chestnut ''no conclusive
proof''.
On the minor theme -- the dialectic between pirate fact and pirate
legend -- Cordingly fares better, though more on the mythical aspects of
pirates would have been welcome. Why are the most famous fictional
pirates, like Captain Hook and Long John Silver, lamed figures? Is this
simply, as Cordingly suggests, because naturalistically there was heavy
loss of life and limb on board buccaneer ships? Or is this a case of
archetypal feedback from Melville's Captain Ahab and other maimed
Promethean heroes? Cordingly does not consider the latter possibility.
Any discussion of fictional pirates must focus strongly on Robert
Louis Stevenson and Long John Silver from Treasure Island. Silver, as
Cordingly correctly observes, was based both on an actual pirate and on
Stevenson's crippled friend W E Henley. But as a student of the
''palimpsest effect'' Cordingly might have taken Silver's fate in
popular culture a stage further. Silver was himself co-opted by Robert
Newton in the 1950 movie of Treasure Island in what some take to be the
definitive portrait of the sea cook and pirate. But Newton's hammy
''Aha, Jim lad'' portrayal was itself taken over by Tony Hancock. A
favourite Hancock conceit was to play all the principal Shakespearean
characters in the roistering, larger-than-life manner of Newton's
Silver.
There is much to entertain and fascinate in all sections of
Cordingly's readable book, but the volume is finally pervaded by an
extreme uncertainty of tone. As Cordingly has set himself the task of
writing a popular book while at the same time satisfying a scholarly
audience, the level of his argumentation and even of his prose is wildly
uneven. At its best the approach produces a judicious mixture of
narrative and analysis, but at others it makes the author appear like
another of R L Stevenson's creations: not Long John Silver but Jekyll
and Hyde.

DEFOE IN EDINBURGH AND OTHER PAPERS
Paul H Scott
Tuckwell Press, #12.99
I REMEMBER being tormented by a Canadian friend. ''What, apart from
Sheena Easton, has Scotland ever given the world?'' he asked. In my
anger I only managed to come up with steam engines, televisions, and
Robert Burns.
Now, had I been in possession of Defoe in Edinburgh, I could have
turned to its longest piece, ''Cultural Independence'', and I could have
boasted of penicillin, anaesthetics, antiseptic surgery, pneumatic
tyres, The Wealth of Nations, and much else. I might even have put my
friend to complete shame by reading him those proud pieces on The Treaty
of Arbroath, David Hume, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Lord Byron.
Paul H Scott is a vice-president of the SNP, and a frequent
contributor to The Herald. His tenth book is Defoe in Edinburgh and
Other Papers: historical essays mostly, and a few pieces of journalism,
some of which appeared earlier in this newspaper -- and all with
relevance to Scotland's present situation.
Scott is an excellent writer. He is expert on Scottish history,
politics, literature, and culture in general. Like Andrew Fletcher, the
subject of the third essay in this collection, Scott could convincingly
be called ''The Patriot''.
Do not be put off. The man's patriotism is his strength. In fact, one
of his major quarrels with Unionism is the way in which it has
suppressed Scottish self-respect. Quite properly, he complains that
things Scottish are too infrequently taught in Scottish schools. Like
this reviewer, confronted by his Canadian friend, fewer and fewer young
Scottish people know what we have to be proud of.
Nationalism is at the heart of this collection. But non-nationalists
should not be worried; any subjective jingoism is reserved for the
treatment of Scottish literary figures, where is it never distasteful
and where it is frequently deserved. The historical pieces evince a
style which is scholarly and skilful. With the political pieces the
writing is persuasive, but almost always objective.
''The End of Britishness'', the book's closing essay, shows the way in
which the Union is an artificial invention. It holds the Union up as one
of those monolithic, age-old institutions which should be reformed but
which traditionalists hold on to under the banner of nostalgia.
The title essay is concerned with Daniel Defoe's stay in Edinburgh
during the Treaty of Union debates. Defoe was in Scotland as both
propagandist and spy for the English Government. It is the sort of
deception which Paul Scott tells us is implicit in Unionism.

Jude's desire for acceptance is something with which she can batter
society for the rest of her life.
FIVE MINUTES IN HEAVEN
Lisa Alther
Viking, #15
THE bare bones of this story could sound impossibly depressing, yet
the novel is rescued by tenderness, humour, and a determined warmth.
Most of the problems are in the beginning and it flags towards the
end; elsewhere it is entirely captivating. There is a curiously downbeat
prologue, written from a position of vague reminiscence, which borrows
other memories to compound its existence, but simply confuses the issue.
It has a louche, expectant atmosphere, and offers nothing more
meaningful than the stunning idea that Paris is a foreign place. Jude
has gone on the advice of a friend: ''A change of venue would do you
good,'' he says.
The novel begins on Chapter Two with Jude's childhood best friend
Molly and their struggles with Ace Kilgore's Commie Killers gang. Here
Jude's desire for acceptance, to be one of the crowd, is beautifully
understated as simply part of her, the way she is rather than something
unusual or hurtful, something with which she can batter society for the
rest of her life.
Mostly she wants to be like the boys, and her androgynous Christian
name is the biggest clue. From here, the focus is on Jude and the
circumstances of her life, rather than on what a lesser writer would
have seen as its dominant feature.
Her parents seem to have been happily married. Her mother's death left
Jude with a feeling of separateness, which is compounded when she reads
her parents' letters with adolescent certainty and misunderstanding.
''Sometimes as I doze, I almost imagine it's you there beside me.'' Her
mother wrote to Jude's father: ''But when I open my eyes, I see it's
only Jude. She's an amusing little creature but it's you I need, my
precious love in the way only you can provide.''
Jude is drawn to Molly, who prefers the company of Ace Kilgore. He
hovers, waiting to pounce, a sinner for Molly to save. With her on his
knee in the back of a car, he taunts the junior high school driver to go
faster. They miss a curve and roll down an embankment. Molly is thrown
out the window and the car lands on top of her. Jude cannot go to the
funeral, and doesn't want to become a woman. ''You love a man, and it
destroys you,'' she says.
At the centre is the love mythologised in the American South. The
first is reflected in the title -- an adolescent love called after a
kissing game. The second is graveyard love, which lasts until both
lovers are dead. ''If Molly and I have a graveyard love, I guess we're
halfway home,'' says Jude whose passions usually lead to death. When
Jude loves, her lover dies and this is the record of her struggle. To
survive.
To chart these details would give the wrong impression for this is
ultimately a joyous book which acutely observes the absurdities of human
behaviour and remains true to its original intention. Though the action
takes place over 30 years, there is neither a displacement of time nor a
reliance on incidents to tell the story. Neither does it resort to cameo
constructions of character.
Lisa Alther opts for the far more difficult route of sticking to the
emotional truth and in the main avoiding sentimentality, which provides
the narrative with strength and honesty and ultimately dignifies Jude.
Her alter ego, Sandy, is killed by queer-bashers, her lover Anna dies
of alcoholism, and then Jude falls for a Parisian exotic dancer who
lives on the Ile St Louis and gives her the runaround. Molly, Sandy, and
Anna fancied folk who made them suffer; now she has fallen into their
pit. ''It was the promise of extinguishing your lonely separate self in
a power you had defined as greater than your own. It was graveyard love
run amok.''
But rather than conveying obsession, Lisa Alther shows a mushy
sentimental longing. Olivia never comes to life. Above the Atlantic,
Jude realises those she loved were her own illusions and graveyard love
is the love itself. Then she tries to get off with the stewardess.

DOMINO
Ross King
Sinclair-Stevenson, #10
GEORGE Cautley is a jejune artist in the devious and manipulative
world of late eighteenth-century London society. He is in search of
fortune, love, and social standing. He believes that by meeting the
right tutor, by painting the right society portrait, and by acquiring
the right clothes, he can make his way. But, despite being someone who
deals in the business of appearances, he has little conception of just
how deceptive they can be.
He finds his society model in the form of Lady Beauclair. While
Cautley is painting her she tells him a story about the ambiguous
identity of Tristano, a famous castrato singer who comes to a miserable
end. He also finds his master in the form of the painter Sir Endymion
Starker. Starker's mistress, Eleanora, tells him another story about the
dangers of confusing appearance and reality. Cautley finds that his own
destiny is bound up with these narratives and he, too, finally comes to
grief.
All these stories are re-told by Cautley himself when, in his old age,
he meets a young boy who is curious to know the secrets of the girl he
sees in a miniature portrait. An echo of the old painter's innocent and
youthful self, this boy wants clear answers. But Cautley's conclusion is
(to his companion's understandable frustration) that some part of each
of his stories must remain secret because even the storyteller doesn't
know himself properly: ''Are not our own hearts as ambiguous and occult
as the faces of strangers?''
This is the first novel of an academic whose research into his period
has clearly been extensive and loving. A portrait of the London of the
time is laid out before the reader with all the shades and textures of
an extremely broad palette. Everything is scrupulously observed, all the
way from the delineations of a social spectrum, bewildering in its
variety of class and manners, to the smell of excrement on the streets.
When Cautley travels out of town to meet Starker in Chiswick, you feel
not just the gradations of changing topography, but the very distance he
walks.
It's impressive but laborious stuff. The plot jerks ahead in a series
of episodic vignettes and, due to the several layers of narrative, gets
delayed tediously rather than enticingly. It makes you wonder what all
the attention to period is for. As compared to Erica Jong's classic
pastiche of eighteenth-century England in Fanny it is positively
lifeless. Jong used the past as a strategic device to tell a modern
erotic story. Her detail is much sketchier, but her language vibrates
with an irreverent intensity which ends up seeming true to both past and
present. With Ross King you get the feeling that, despite the greater
knowledge, it's all just a means of making a novel out of PhD material.

ANIMAL FARM: Special edition with pictures by Ralph Steadman
George Orwell
Secker and Warburg, #14.99
WHEN Orwell finished what he provocatively called ''a fairy story'' in
1944 he knew that, in Animal Farm, he had created a politically
incorrect fiction for a warring world in which Uncle Joe, like Uncle
Sam, was supposed to be fighting the good fight. ''It is anti-Stalin'',
Orwell warned left-wing publisher Victor Gollancz who took a look at
Animal Farm and decided he ''could not possibly publish . . . a general
attack of this nature''.
Liberal publisher Jonathan Cape discussed the text with a man from the
Ministry of Information, then turned the book down as an insult to the
aspirations of the Soviet state: ''I think the choice of pigs as the
ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly
to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are''. In
1944 it was not political to depict Uncle Joe Stalin and his Soviet pals
as pigs.
Top Tory T S Eliot, a director of Faber and Faber, found Animal Farm
stylistically sound but philosophically flawed: ''It ought to excite
some sympathy with what the author wants, as well as sympathy with his
objections to something; and the positive point of view, which I take to
be generally Trotskyite, is not convincing.'' Eliot had some sympathy
for Orwell's Stalinist pigs.
Orwell eventually sent the work to Secker and Warburg, then nicknamed
''the Trotskyite publisher'', and it was published by the firm on August
17, 1945, in an edition of 4500 copies which quickly sold out. Since
then it has sold millions of copies in more than 70 languages and earned
Orwell the reputation as the finest satirist since Swift. This special
edition, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Animal Farm, is
imaginatively illustrated by one of the best satirical artists currently
around in England.
Ralph Steadman's ink-spattered style (red-ink-spattered for the
depiction of the gory Battle of the Cowshed) emphasises the satirical
savagery of Orwell's fable with its anthropomorphic interpretation of
animals and zoomorphic interpretation of humans. Steadman's starting
point, conceptually, is the end of Animal Farm: ''The creatures outside
looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again;
but already it was impossible to say which was which.'' Steadman
skilfully helps put the reader in the picture by showing all exploiters
as offensive.
In a preface (written in March 1947) to the Ukrainian edition of
Animal Farm, Orwell explained that he wrote his book to illustrate how
easily individuals submit to ideological exploitation. A dogmatic faith
can fool most of the folk most of the time. Orwell was appalled at the
way some followers of the Soviet faith were willing to go down like
animals to the slaughter. He wanted to liberate folk through a story
showing how a noble ideal can be twisted into an evil ideology.
Most folk are familiar with the story by now. An old boar, old Major
(standing for Marx on four legs), hopes for a world previously beyond
the wildest dreams of the other animals of Manor Farm -- a world without
Mr Jones, their lord and master. Major talks to the animals and the
clever pigs are attentive, and the cart-horse Boxer attends as the
animal equivalent of the poor plodding exploited proletarian.
Thus speaks the Marxist Major: ''What then must we do? Why, work night
and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is my
message to you, comrades: Rebellion! . . . All men are enemies. All
animals are comrades . . . All animals are equal.'' Shortly after
delivering his Communist manifesto, old Major dies and leaves his
disciples to revolutionise their wretched lives.
This they do on the day Jones forgets to feed them. Their hunger turns
to anger, they kick out the exploiters and Manor Farm is renamed Animal
Farm by pigs who have taught themselves to write. Snowball (Trotsky),
Napoleon (Stalin), and Squealer (any old party hack) reduce the Marxist
vision of Major to the dogma of Animalism which simply celebrates all
four-legged friends as equals.
Inspired by the military strategy of Snowball and the muscular
strength of Boxer, Animal Farm is able to resist attack by Jones and his
reactionary gang at the Battle of the Cowshed. However, Snowball's plans
for permanent revolution are anathema to Napoleon, an increasingly
reactionary pig. Exit Snowball, pursued by Napoleon's savage dogs. Enter
the era of Napoleon and Squealer -- and it's one law for the leaders and
another for the beasts who have to bear them as a burden.
After being attacked by Napoleon's dogs, pigs mildly sympathetic to
Snowball confess to crimes they never committed: ''Without any further
prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with
Snowball ever since his expulsion . . . and that they had entered into
an agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr Frederick. They
added that Snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been
Jones's secret agent for years past.'' They are slaughtered and Napoleon
is at liberty to rewrite history by attributing to Snowball his own
crimes against the ideals of Marxist Major: executing enemies, doing a
deal with the Hitlerian figure of farmer Frederick, doing what came
naturally to farmer Jones.
All the positive aspects of Animalism are abandoned by Napoleon. Boxer
is sent to the knacker's yard and Napoleon, seen ''strolling in the
farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth'', is more equal than all the
other animals put together as he acts the part of an old-fashioned
farmer and announces that Animal Farm will once again be known as Manor
Farm.
Revolutionary dogmatists promise to change the world but it's just the
same old story -- so the story goes as brilliantly told by Orwell in
Animal Farm. Exploitation is, all in, an ideologically wicked world and
noble principles are a threat to beastly politicians who viciously plot
against the principled.
Fifty years ago Orwell was accused of insulting Stalinists by
comparing them to pigs. Now we might consider pigs the ones insulted.

John McKinley looks back with fond memories on three-week family
getaway full of surpises including the weather, fine cuisine,
captivating coastal views, and magnificent rock formations
IT COMES as something of a surprise in the elegant environs of La
Rochelle to discover that steaming plates of mussels in their shells
with side plates of chips are top of the menu in virtually all the cafes
and bars on the fashionable harbour front.
For a Campbeltown man used to the universal put-down about the ''chips
with everything'' diet of the West of Scotland, it was all a bit of a
culture shock, and certainly far from the French seafood masterpiece I
had anticipated ordering.
But Moules et Frites had the advantage of being relatively cheap, and
that appealed to my Scottish disposition, so I joined the vast majority
of the locals, international yachties and other tourists. When In Rome .
. .
I found that ''La difference'' was in the inexpensive bottle of
Bordeaux blanc I also ordered. That and the entrancing view from the
pavement table across the harbour to the floodlit
fourteenth/fifteenth-century towers guarding the entrance, combined with
the music of the jazz band in almost cobbled streets to dispel further
comparison with home.
A stopover at La Rochelle was just more than halfway through our
three-week continental odyssey during which my wife, I, and two
19-year-olds drove more than 3000 miles in search of the sun, and found
that food wasn't the only surprise in store for us.
This was a trip we had always planned some day, so when the
opportunity arrived unexpectedly we grabbed it with both hands. The
route was fairly straightforward, Glasgow to Plymouth to embark on
Brittany Ferries' 24-hour service to Santander in north-west Spain. On
to San Sebastian, across the French border to Biarritz, various side
trips to the Pyrenees, then Ile d'Oleron, La Rochelle, the Vendee, and
finally St Malo before boarding another Brittany Ferries ship, this time
to Portsmouth and the motorway home to Glasgow. Even yet, seeing the
names on the computer screen in front of me represents a mouth-watering
experience.
We did, however, run into unexpected problems, mainly with the
weather. We chose to go in September to escape the summer crowds and we
were prepared to accept that the climate would be a little more mixed,
but we thought it would still be largely sunny and warm. Big mistake . .
.
What we got was nine dry days out of 21, and only four warm enough for
the beach. There were spells of non-stop rain, often torrential, and
near Biarritz we saw the best and the worst of the weather. It was there
in early September that we ran into a thunderstorm which clattered
hailstones the size of marbles down on the car in such density that
everyone on the motorway was forced to a dead stop within seconds. In
the morning when we left to move on, we found powerlines and tree
branches had been brought down across the road in several places.
What surprised us most was how bitterly cold it was when the sun was
behind clouds, and that was often. We were staying for most of the time
in Eurocamp mobile homes in campsites, and the gas fires were in
constant use whenever we were indoors.
Later we heard from several sources that it had been the worst
mid-September over large parts of France for 80 years. Time cures all,
they say, and, months on, it is the highlights other than the rain that
we remember. It is always a thrill to visit a place that was no more
than a name on the map before, gauging whether it lives up to the
exciting picture in your mind's eye.
Apart from the caravan sites we arranged several stopovers in hotels
in selected areas. They were too short for any more than snapshot
impressions, but they whetted the appetite for return visits. La
Rochelle was a case in point, as was San Sebastian, our only Spanish
overnight after docking at Santander.
It was glorious sunshine when we first set wheels on the Spanish
mainland -- one of the few 80-plus temperatures we enjoyed -- and we
wasted little time advancing down a busy and somewhat industrialised
coastline to the queen of the Basque resorts, San Sebastian, or Donostia
to the Basques.
This quite glorious and gracious town, with its sweeping boulevards
and captivating views of coast and mountains, made an indelible
impression on us. The friendliness of its people, quick to claim a
Celtic affinity, continues to add to the warmth of already happy
memories.
We found inexpensive accommodation fairly easily -- although advance
booking would be worth considering in the high season or during
festivals -- in a family run hotel on Mt Iqueldo. From the little
communal balcony there is spectacular scenery in every direction, and
particularly across La Concha Bay whose fashionable crescent-shaped
beaches arrive finally at the old town. It is here at the foot of the
famed Mt Urgull where this community of 175,000 souls all began.
A visit to this historic area is a must, its lively bars and
restaurants crowding into its narrow streets offering respite for tired
feet, and good local dishes. Here also is the Plaza de la Constitucion
whose numbered balconies give the clue to its former existence as a
bullring, the sixteenth-century Gothic church of San Vicente and the
eighteenth-century church of Santa Maria.
San Sebastian's regimented street layout makes it easy for a visitor
to follow. The old town had to be substantially rebuilt after Napoleon's
troops were forcibly removed in 1813, but it was so carefully done it is
almost impossible to tell.
We packed a lot into a a short time in Donostia, but there is so much
more to see and experience, from entrancing coastal and mountain
villages to every imaginable sporting activity on land and sea. In the
Basque language of our hosts: ''Eskerrik Asko'' -- literal translation
''a lot of thanks''.
From there it is a short hop across the border to Biarritz, in
guidebook parlance ''a fascinating mixture of the grand old 'station
balneaire', so fashionable in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, and a
vibrant modern resort, all set off by a magnificent position on the
rugged Basque coastline''.
Unlike the ordered lines of San Sebastian, Biarritz has a kind of
haphazard charm, lending to an impression of the unexpected round the
next corner. Or perhaps it was just the feeling of being stung after
paying #3.50 each for cafe blanc at a pavement table of a cafe which was
somewhat less than grand. You learn to look or ask before you sit.
Biarritz is where we enjoyed two more of our precious beach days,
joining the sun worshippers in front of the casino. Here we smiled as we
watched sophisticated ladies floating through the town centre holding
tiny dogs in one hand, gently pressed against the hip, like some kind of
live fashion accessory. It certainly gave a whole new meaning to taking
the dog for a walk.
The teenagers in our party loved the town, but not the nightlife.
Their verdict on the music scene in nightclubs and discos -- ''Two years
behind us, and too many sugar daddies''.
We stayed for a week at a campsite at nearby Bidart in a roomy
six-berth mobile home with its own shower, cooker, fridge/freezer and,
of course, the increasingly essential gas fire. It was an excellent base
for exploration. To the north Aquitaine and mile after mile of the sandy
fragrant pine forests of Les Landes, fabulous beaches boasting the
highest dunes in the world, charming villages; to the south the vibrant
and colourful Basque coast and country; then you have the Pyrenees.
Every sport, even whitewater rafting, is here and the choice of day
trips as boundless as their appeal.
We went to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, on the coast close to the Spanish border
and another which has known the ravages of war down through its history.
Louis XIV married the Infanta of Spain here in the Basque style church
of St-Jean-Baptiste in 1660. The door they used to enter the church was
walled in afterwards.
The church is deceptively unexciting from the outside -- the
temptation is to pass it by -- but the interior is stunning. A couple of
francs in the electric meter will light up the striking monumental
altarpiece long enough for tourists to take photographs.
A round trip of 250 miles seems a long way for a day trip, but well
worth it to see the Cirque de Gavarnie, accurately described in The
Rough Guide as one of Europe's ''most stupendous natural spectacles''.
The almost perfect semi-circle of rock, 1400 metres from top to bottom
and 900 metres wide, was torn out of the Pyrenees by glaciers. The
awesome walls of the cirque appear to rise almost sheer to a series of
summit peaks of more than 3000 metres, which mark the border with Spain.
It's as well to arrive early to give you time to appreciate at leisure
nature at its most beautiful. You also need to be reasonably fit as the
car has to be left in the village, and the last hour of relatively easy
trail is completed either on foot or by donkey (easily hired in the
village). The donkeys go as far as the famed Hotel Du Cirque (now only a
cafe with no bedrooms), close enough to have a magnificent view of the
Grande Cascade, the waterfall said to have the longest drop in Europe.
Take a picnic with you if walking -- a stop at the Plateau de la Prade
puts the whole are in majestic perspective.
Lourdes is on the way and another ''must'' for the first-time visitor.
There is so much that impresses at the grotto, not least the hundreds of
pilgrims of every nationality and the devotion of the army of church
helpers who look after them.
More disappointing was the ''shanty town'' of shops which has grown up
around it, selling cheap plastic bottles shaped like the Virgin Mary to
hold grotto water, and other poor-quality religious souvenirs. Sadder
still was a sign on church property warning of pickpockets.
Time to move north again beyond Bordeaux to the Charente Maritime area
of Royan, Rochefort, and La Rochelle. Our base here is Ile d'Oleron, the
largest of the French islands after Corsica, and noted for a mild
climate, oyster farming, fine beaches, and a three-kilometre bridge to
the mainland which locals wrongly believe to the most beautiful in the
world. Without doubt, a good family holiday centre.
Our final camp site was in the Vendee at St Jean-de-Monts, part of
coastline boasting almost continuous beaches, caravan sites and holiday
flats and entertainments of every kind. I'm sure it's a riot in summer
when the sun almost invariably shines, but by now the weather was so
awful it would be unfair to make any judgment. Many of the summer
entertainments were closed down or were in the process of doing so, but
that would not have been a problem if the sun had shone just a little
more.
Our last stop in France was Saint Malo, where we embarked on the
Brittany Ferries sailing to Portsmouth. It was a beautiful day as we
left and as we neared the English coast, only the good memories began to
flood back, and already there was the hint of a longing to return.
The certainty of warm summer weather is appealing for a trip like
this, but prices are so much greater all round in the high season and
you have to put up with the crowds. Also, it is apparently unusual for
the weather in September to be quite as bad as we experienced.
The Eurocamp mobile homes we stayed in were all excellent, as were the
staff and facilities, and the holiday company arranged details such as
the ferries and insurance. The cost this year for 18 days in September
for four people, including ferries and cabin accommodation, is a very
reasonable #1135.80. In the July 15 to August 13 high season you would
have had to pay #2499.80, more than double.
Add the cost of petrol or diesel, motorway tolls (which can be avoided
some of the time), plus overnight hotel accommodation for three nights
which varied from #25 to #60 for four of us exclusive of breakfast.

* TO show her love for Mark Antony, Cleopatra left a valuable pearl in
a cup of wine one night. We are sure there were many ways in which
Cleopatra showed her love for Mark Antony, but pearls are alleged to
have an aphrodisiac effect when marinated. Whether he swallowed it or
spat it out we are not sure, but it obviously did the trick. The pearl
was laid before the swine and he fell for it.
Beauty Box is in receipt of a catalogue of pearls now on sale at
Frasers. Fine or natural pearls are now so rare and costly that
jewellers treat them as ''antique pieces''. These are accidentally
created as a result of a foreign body, such as a grain of sand,
infiltrating an oyster, which is then compelled to protect itself by
secreting the substance which forms the pearl. Nowadays, pearls are
produced by a more cruel method. A man-made body is inserted into the
oyster, a bead much larger than the layers of substance secreted, which
eventually comprises over 90% of the pearl's overall size.
Majorca pearls, however, are man-made. They have to be. Through their
merchandise, the company maintain, customers can ''enjoy a pearl whose
quality and beauty would otherwise prove increasingly inaccessible
because of the degradation now taking place in the natural
environment''. The Majorca collection comprises over 1500 designs in
four different colours, and items cost from #15 to #650.

* ''LET it out, let it unravel, let it be a path on which to travel''
(Leunig). Regardless of whether this quotation was intended to praise
the art of knitting, it has, none the less, been adopted by three women
whose lives were altered after they had completed a two-year Creative
Textile Course at the Cowane Arts Centre, Stirling. They are Annette
Brown, Alison Brough, and Claire Tester, and the latter was the first to
complete the course last year.
Claire is now a hatmaker, supplying The Hat Shop in Covent Garden and
Jenners. She describes the OCA course as ''Fun, Delight, Creativity,
Release of Spirit and Ideas''. As you can probably gather it made her
less inhibited about showing her feelings. Women in need of such a tonic
(an evening with each member of Take That would be far better for the
ego) may be interested in going to see an exhibition of the work
undertaken during the Open College of the Arts Textiles Courses, at the
Cowane Centre, Stirling from August 26 to September 23.
* SELF-HELP culture is no longer regarded as Thatcherite. People who
want to raise money will devise schemes for doing so. Charities are
often motivated by someone who has personal experience of the tragedy
with which they are helping others to cope. In order to gain funds to
raise money for breast-cancer research, Julia Herbert Bridal Designs are
organising a Bridal Fashion Show. There will be a raffle and the winner
will be entitled to an exclusive wedding dress designed by Julia Herbert
herself.
''We're trying to sell a thousand tickets and we've sold six,'' says
organiser Mrs Moira Pearson. ''So many people die in Scotland every year
from this dreadful disease.
''I myself had lumps removed. I was sent to London where the surgeon
asked me how much coffee I drank, because they now think that oil from
coffee beans may have something to do with breast cancer. Think of all
the women in Scotland who drink gallons of it! They could be killing
themselves.
''What we would love to do ultimately is to sponsor a scientist to
research this theory. There are so any projects waiting to be developed.
It would cost #8000 a year for three years to sponsor a scientist.
Something has to be done.''
* For information and tickets regarding The Bridal Fashion Show on
September 17 please contact the RSAC Club or Mrs Moira Pearson at Bridal
Designs on 0141 332 5545. Tickets cost #5 each.

The man may have been a creative cosmetics genius, but, as Anvar Khan
finds, everything was approached with military precision
MAX Factor was an interesting old dude. The man who pioneered the
cosmetics industry was born in Poland. After serving an apprenticeship
he became a wigmaster and make-up artist to the Imperial Theatres of
Czarist Russia. In 1904 he emigrated to America and established a
perfume, make-up, and hair-goods concession at the St Louis World Fair.
Sussing out the rapid development of the motion-picture industry in
Los Angeles, Max Factor smartly moved his family to Hollywood, where Max
Factor and Co was formed in 1909. He worked his butt off and became the
first person to produce a make-up specially formulated for the
motion-picture industry. Indeed, in 1916 his ''Society'' range of
make-up and lipstick shades were harmonised to tone in with the wearer's
natural colour. Until this point, cosmetics for the individual had never
been thought of before. By 1930, he was already exporting to 81
countries.
Without his make-up, it would have been impossible for the movie
industry to take full advantage of the light and shade sensitivity of
panchromatic film. For this, Max Factor received an Academy Award. The
Max Factor museum in Hollywood, a testament to his achievement, is worth
a look.
The Max Factor Museum of Beauty spans over 80 years of cosmetic
innovation and Hollywood history. Inside, visitors can view a
contraption called the Beauty Calibrator. Max Factor was talented but,
like most pioneers, he was painstakingly weird. The machine is a cage
the shape of a knight's helmet and consists of Marquis de Sade spiky
rods which span from the top of the head to below the jawline. It was
invented to measure by millimetre the faces of screen beauties. It
allowed Max Factor to test exact proportions and design a unique,
individual look for each woman.
There was more. Max decided that each colour type should have a colour
co-ordinated room complete with his sets of individual colour-tone
cosmetics. He used the peach-coloured make-up room when designing a look
that complemented the hair, skin, and eyes of women with auburn hair.
Chambers were also created for brunettes, blondes, and redheads. He used
a contraption called the Kissing Machine which was created to test the
indelibility of lipstick. It pressed two pairs of rubberised lips
together to create the perfect 10-pound smacker -- an idea which was, in
a sense, ahead of its time. Now collagen injections provide the plush,
pneumatic flesh with which to provide luscious Hollywood kisses.
* Available mid-August, Max Factor's new Earth Spirits Eyeshadow,
finely milled and crease-resistant, in 15 colours from #2.49 each. Only
#1.99 rrp for first four weeks.

As the RSPB and other organisations expand, Naill Benvie asks if
birdwatchers are harming the birds or the countryside
THE rise in the number of people who play, rather than work, in the
countryside is not in itself a problem for wildlife; if anything, there
are fewer people there today than 60 years ago when agriculture employed
many people. Furthermore, most regular countryside users pay money, in
the form of taxes or subscriptions to wildlife organisations, for its
conservation. The growing number of people who wish to experience the
countryside should therefore be welcomed.
Problems arise because of the localised concentration of people taking
part in countryside leisure, making their presence more visible on the
landscape and more keenly felt by wildlife. Sometimes, the effects, such
as footpath erosion on Munros, are tangible. Often, though, they are
expressed more subtly, such as in the abandonment of cliff-top nest
sites at heavily visited seabird colonies.
Concentration of birdwatchers, to cite one group, arises because of a
number of factors, the most important of which relate to information and
communication. Fifteen years ago, news of recent bird sightings and
where to find what moved relatively slowly on a fairly local basis for
all except the famous birdwatching hot spots. Things have changed
dramatically.
The potential value of the ''birdwatching market'' was recognised in
the 1980s and now the burgeoning ranks of Britain's birdwatchers are
served by two major magazines which share more than 100,000 readers each
month. In addition to merchandising, identification tips and
photo-features, extensive coverage is given to sightings of rarities and
where to find them.
For vagrants, or birds on passage, this rarely matters since the birds
have usually died or left by the time they appear in print. For uncommon
resident species, however, even a hint of their locality can attract
unwanted attention to them, be it from birdwatchers or from those
unsympathetic to birds.
While the magazines cater for the mass market of birdwatchers,
''bird-lines'' and paging services are aimed at the most dedicated
followers of rarities. The ''grapevine'' used by ''twitchers'' to learn
of the latest rare bird arrivals in Britain was formalised in the 1980s
into bird-lines, 0891 numbers which offer the most up-to-date
information for the cost of the call.
These services are run in a very responsible manner but if this
information relates to breeding birds, the potential exists for a
conflict of interest. The threatened capercailzie is one species which
can be highly vulnerable to disturbance.
For people without the time or inclination to get to know their
subjects well ''information parasitism'', or spoon-feeding, provides a
ready opportunity to extend the tick list with minimal effort.
Importantly, though, it results in the concentration of observers at
publicised localities. Why waste time searching one area when you know
that the bird can be seen with certainty in another?
Nature reserves may appear to disprove the notion that concentration
is detrimental: conservation organisations actively encourage people to
visit their reserves, after all. Economic reality dictates that they
must. Managing a reserve to maximise its biological interest and
diversity is expensive and the reserve can contribute to that cost by
using interpretive centres and hides to attract visitors and the reserve
shop to relieve them of some money.
This makes good commercial sense; the RSPB's shops and mail-order
business netted between them more than #2m in 1994. For the shop to be
successful, ever more people have to be drawn to the reserve, by the
provision of better facilities and more sophisticated interpretation.
Nature reserves are demonstrably successful at managing concentration
(the RSPB's Loch Garten osprey hide attracts up to 100,000 visitors
between April and September each year) because people are controlled,
channelled along duck-boarding, and directed into hides at a discreet
distance. Regulation of access allows large numbers of people to see
some of Britain's rarest and most spectacular birds, for example Loch
Ruthven's Slavonian grebes (under the protection of the RSPB), without
causing disturbance. This situation contrasts with one or two well-known
lochans in Strathspey which also host Slavonians, where access is
unrestricted to the hundreds of birdwatchers who have heard on the
grapevine about the sites and come from afar to add the tick to their
list.
Nature reserves, for all their good points, offer the human users a
pale imitation of the wilderness experience. The intimacy between
observer and bird is, of necessity, lost, and with that intimacy, a
degree of empathy disappears too. When I float around a tidal lagoon in
a hide following eider ducks, I feel the waves and the wind with them,
something which is impossible from a warm, dry hide on land. In the
lagoon I need to know the time and height of the tides, the direction of
currents, and where the mud is dangerous.
These are things which involve the observer; the experience is an
active one. Visitors to nature reserves are, of necessity, denied the
opportunity to develop their fieldcraft and to become active
participants rather than passive observers. How can the same degree of
respect for their subjects develop?
Compounding the problems of uncontrolled concentration are those which
relate to the penetration of remote areas by ever more people. It is now
rare to find oneself alone on the high peaks, even during weekdays.
Unfortunately, the eagerness of some to see a new species or to add
another Munro to their list exceeds their awareness of the sensitivity
of the alpine environment.
Chairlifts make it easy to reach the summits of, for example,
Cairngorm and Glas Maol, taking a larger number of people into these
areas than would otherwise find their own way. If access is to be
facilitated and encouraged, control must necessarily acompany it to
minimise environmental disturbance and damage.
A suggestion to restrict access on the basis of willingness or ability
to work for a wilderness experience, to many, smacks of elitism. But if
the number of birdwatchers (to name but one group) continues to rise and
more importantly, to concentrate, choices will need to be made. It is
one small step from a birdwatcher paying for phone information to paying
a landowner for access to see the bird. Indeed, this already happens in
an informal way at some of the major ''twitches''.
Once birdwatchers are considered fair game, then why not
photographers, walkers, and horse-riders next?
I fear that many more landowners may come to view birdwatchers and
other ''informal'' countryside users as an untapped source of income,
ripe for exploitation. Isn't it just a form of entertainment, after all?
And wasn't the precedent set by conservation bodies who started to
charge for access to their reserves more than 25 years ago? To my mind,
elitism based on ability to pay is far less desirable than one based on
willingness to work for an experience.
More importantly, the conservation ethic which underpins the view of
nature as a variety of resources is deeply flawed. The capitalisation of
Scotland's wildlife and scenic highlights may give them protection but
what becomes of all the rest?
The right to roam free is rooted deeply in the Scottish psyche. We
have a cultural aversion to ''No . . . '' signs. But if we are to earn
that right we must exhibit a sensitivity and knowledge of the land and
people who work on it which is often lacking among those who claim to
love it best. Yet, without the opportunity to learn directly from nature
rather than second-hand through an expert's interpretation, we are
denied the possibility of developing an intimacy with, and respect for,
the land which is the only sure foundation for a profound and lasting
belief in conservation.

SCOTTISH HILL TRACKS
Revised by John Bartholomew, Donald Bennet and Clifford Stone
Scottish Rights of Way Society, #10.95
A REVISED version of an original compilation by Donald Moir, this
up-to-date edition has been brought out to coincide with the
Edinburgh-based Scottish Rights of Way Society's 150th anniversary this
year.
In a now popular format for outdoor guidebooks, with a laminated cover
and compact in size to make it easily portable, the book contains
information on more than 300 cross-country walks over hills and moors,
through glens and passes the length and breadth of Scotland.
Many of the routes follow ancient roads and trackways dating back to
Roman and medieval times, such as the best remaining section of Roman
road -- a 20km stretch of Dere Street, from the Cheviots to Jedfoot,
which has been very little disturbed since it was made in the second
century AD.
The introduction points out that not all the routes are legal rights
of way, but adds: '' . . . in choosing the routes and describing their
lines, the compilers have selected those where it is felt the public can
go with reasonable confidence that they are not infringing the
legitimate rights and privacy of those who live in the countryside''.
Walkers who adhere to the ''freedom to roam'' principle of free
countryside access providing responsible rules of conduct are followed,
will readily take issue with this statement as limited and restrictive
of their moral rights.
That issue aside, however, Scottish Hill Tracks provides a wealth of
useful information to those looking for ideas about where to walk in
Scotland.
The more adventurous can use the book as a reference point for
devising their own customised walks, or link together parts of the vast
network of descriptions to provide multi-day outings. There are maps at
the end of the book, though detailed Ordnance Survey or similar maps
will still be needed and should, in any case, be carried.
Excellently reproduced colour pictures greatly enhance the appearance
of the book and are, as always, a great inspiration to pulling on the
walking boots and setting off into the wide blue yonder.

Hugh Ouston charts the rise of the oprey
IT STARTED with an Osprey. Not the fish-hawk but the name used to
market the Egret plumes, ripped from the living birds, which adorned the
hats at Ascot before the First World War. It was to stop this barbaric
trade that the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began in the
1890s. Meanwhile the last Scottish Ospreys were being extinguished by
''sportsmen'' and ''oologists''.
Every visitor to Loch an Eilean in Rothiemurchus knows the story of
the collector who swam out to the castle in a snow storm, climbed the
square tower and almost caught the hen bird as she tried to keep her
genes warm against a Cairngorm yowdendrift.
Now only jackdaws clack around this most picturesque breeding site,
but elsewhere in 1993 88 pairs of Scottish ospreys raised 111 chicks.
Scotland was recolonised from the increasing numbers of Scandinavian
Ospreys passing through each spring. They fly in from Gambia at the
start of April on the last leg of a leisurely piscatorial migration.
They build up their eyries, up to 300 cubic feet of sticks, by diving at
dead branches as they do at living fish and snapping them off to carry
home fore and aft.
No need to check out the new series of Hooked on Scotland; an osprey
is a fishing machine from its shockproof eyelids to its sandpaper toes.
Trout farmers know this well, but ospreys prefer a basking estuarine
grey mullet and a snatch rather than the photogenic deep plunge.
Seventeenth century poets believed they had the power to make the fish
''turn their glistening bellies up'' for their talons.
The RSPB has grown exponentially in parallel. At Loch Garten more than
a million people since 1958 have been introduced through Ospreys to the
pleasures of birdlife in Scotland. Same word, different feathers, and a
marketing success to a purpose, for once.

AT FIRST GLANCE, it looks like your average Royal Mail van. On second
glance too. Yet this is the first Ecostar vehicle, an advanced
experimental electric van designed by Ford. The little escort parcel
carrier will be used in a 30-month experiment delivering the mail in
competition with ordinary escort diesels.
The trial is part of Ford's world-wide experimental programme across
Europe and the US, including the UK's post vans and another car being
used by Hampshire police.
''By working with leading operations like the Royal Mail, Ford will be
able to measure more accurately how vehicles like the Ecostar perform in
real conditions,'' says Mike Wear, director of fleet operations. Ford
believe that electric run-arounds will soon be part of normal life as
cars head towards environmental friendliness.
The Ecostar is said to be one of the most advanced elec-traks in the
world to date with acceleration comparable to petrol and diesels, a top
speed of 70mph, and a run-down charge range of 200 miles. Powered by an
advanced sodium sulphur battery providing up to three times the power
for conventional lead-acids, the Ecostar can be connected to a domestic
supply for up to seven hours of recharging.
The little Ecostar is faced with a potential rival, however, as,
researchers are speeding ahead in the race to produce an electric car as
testing begins on an automotive-scale fuel cell which converts chemical
energy to electrical energy without combustion. So far they haven't been
able to provide sufficient sustained power at a reasonable cost and size
for use in the car industry, until now.
Engineers from General Motors are working with Los Alamos scientists
in a joint project to push the technology further and develop a car that
can produce 50 kilowatts, equivalent to petrol-driven cars.
They are designing an electrochemical engine that runs on stacks of
proton-exchange membrane fuel cells and the liquid fuel methanol. An
onboard fuel processor converts the methanol into hydrogen and carbon
dioxide. The fuel cell combines the hydrogen with oxygen from outside
air to produce direct current electricity. The electricity, in turn,
powers the traction motors that turn the car's wheels. Simple, no?
Another advantage of the engine design is that it uses methanol, or wood
alcohol, a relatively benign and inexpensive liquid fuel. It's only
malign when imbibed. It makes you blind. However, its by-products are
carbon dioxide and water, virtually like us humans, and can be produced
from agricultural waste or natural gas.
The electrochemical engine offers attractive advantages over an
all-electric battery-powered system, researchers say. Unlike a
battery-powered vehicle that requires long recharging stops and has a
limited driving range, a car equipped with an electrochemical engine
will be able to refuel quickly and have nearly the same driving range
and performance as a conventional four-cylinder car.
The overall goal of the joint development project is to more than
double a car's fuel economy and reduce emissions such as nitrogen
oxides, hydrocarbons, and particulates by more than 90% and reduce
carbon-dioxide emissions by more than 40%.
Whether electric car or new fuel cells, they can't come quickly
enough. The price of petrol is bad enough, but by comparison, isn't the
cost of tiny batteries for our cameras just beyond a joke?

It's magic, says Wendy Jack, as she sees how gardens are transformed
by Paul Stokes.
* LANDSCAPE contractor Paul Stokes is to gardens what an interior
designer is to houses -- a bit of a magician. Taking anything from a few
square yards of a tenement backcourt to a handful of acres, he and his
team can transform the most neglected piece of arid land into an oasis
of beauty and relaxation.
Casting an eye over these ''before'' and ''after'' pictures will
convince the most sceptical that the analogy of a magician is not too
far off the mark.
Hailing originally from West Yorkshire, Stokes left school in 1976 --
a summer, he reflects, which parallelled these long, hot weeks which
will distinguish 1995 for years to come -- and began working for a
nurseryman and landscaper.
He met and married a Scottish lass in 1978, which is why he arrived in
Scotland -- working for someone else until 1982, when he set up on his
own. Today, his company, P D Stokes, is well established and located in
a small office which he rents from the Findlay Clark Garden Centre at
Milngavie.
The most common challenge people bring when they consult him on their
horticultural needs is how to achieve a garden which is easy to
maintain.
''My first rule is to listen to what people want,'' he says. ''If you
have a couple with young children, and you put in intricate areas, it's
not going to work.''
In this way, listening to his clients' wishes, assessing their
lifestyles and then making sketches and suggestions accordingly, the
landscaper echos the role of interior designer. The object of each is to
create a place which suits the people who live there and where they will
feel at ease.
While many people have a number of ideas for the recreation of their
gardens, not many have the creative talent to get it all together.
Stokes, who employs two full-time trained landscape gardeners and two
semi-skilled staff, takes on extra labour to help over the busiest
summer period. He exudes that equable temperament which seems part and
parcel of those who work with the soil. He says he loves the job's
challenges and constantly changing demands.
While the paving of areas such as a patio, terrace, paths or steps
means ease of upkeep, he explains: ''I leave the placing of tubs or
hanging baskets to the owners -- that's where they come in. They add
their own personalities to what we've done.''
When he's called in, Stokes walks around the garden with its owners,
listening and assessing what they seek. Later, he will return with a
sketch and layout of his proposals (for which a charge will be made).
Each section of the proposed garden will be priced: ''People can then
choose according to their budget. I don't think it's ethical to ask what
they can afford to spend first; that way you could have a sum fixed in
your mind.
''Whatever a garden's size, no matter what materials you use,
everything must be in proportion, and the aim is always to bring
together the house and the garden to become a cohesive whole.''
Huge gardens, water gardens, roof terraces, new gardens, neglected
gardens . . . Paul Stokes and his team work wonders in them all. In this
heat, though, a wand would be more than welcome . . .

* WE TEND to think of aerial photographs as ultra-modern maps. But
surprisingly, humans have been able to imagine what it's like down here
from up there for thousands of years. Twenty years ago, a geographer and
a psychologist working together found that children as young as four
years old could read and interpret aerial photographs with no
instruction.
The researchers concluded that children have a natural sense of
mapping -- of seeing the world from an overhead view at a reduced scale
-- and that the ability to read and make maps may be an innate skill
with which every human being is born.
Today, the two researchers -- James Blaut, professor of geography at
the University of Illinois at Chicago and David Stea, professor of
psychology at the Universidad Internacional de Mexico -- have expanded
their study to examine mapmaking in prehistoric societies, in different
cultures throughout the world, and among children.
According the researchers, a map is ''any overhead view of a large
territory at a reduced scale, with the use of signs and icons to
represent reality.'' Even children make maps: for example, when they
build a miniature city out of wooden blocks.
As part of the study, psychologists in Britain and Mexico are working
with children aged three to five to test their ability to read aerial
photos and make maps with toys.
Others are analysing evidence of mapping in prehistoric societies
dating back thousands of years and including prehistoric rock art. One
of the oldest maps ever found, according to Blaut, was discovered on a
wall in an ancient Turkish village and dates back to about 6200 BC. It
depicts all of the houses in the village as seen from overhead and is
several thousand years older than the oldest known writing system.
The researchers will also look for evidence of mapping in cultures
throughout the world. ''All cultures, everywhere, make maps in one form
or another,'' says Blaut.
Now, where were we?
* ST ANDREWS University attracted almost #2.3m in a tranche of grants
from research bodies in the first quarter of the year for work ranging
from defence applications to medical research.
Professor W. Sibbet was awarded #196,625 from the Defence Research
Agency for work on the development for high current electron sources for
high power microwaves. Prof D Gani gets #120,000 from Organon Teknika
for developing combinational libraries, and Drs R Randall and S Homans
get a total of #196,000 from the Wellcome Trust for separate research
projects on immunity and infectious diseases.
The largest cash grant of #407,062 from the EPSRC to Professors M.
Dunn, W Sibbet, and Dr B Sinclair has been awarded for research into
laser sources.
Of the smaller grants, Dr J Soulsby gets #9782 from Scottish National
Heritage for erosion-control measures on Loch Leven, which should please
the trout anglers. Prof P Riedi gets #1200 from Daresbury Rutherford
Appleton Lab for work on Muon Spin relaxation studies which is not some
sort of break-dance, but very heavy particle physics.
Dr R Houston has attracted #14,330 from the Leverhume Trust for work
on the perception of insanity in Scotland, 1660 to 1845. Possibly this
should focus on 1745, but Dr Houston undoubtedly knows best.
Speaking of insanity, Dr M. Ritchie gets #4419 from the Association
for the Study of Animal behaviour for what we are told is work on the
question: ''Does a Celtic accent influence mate choice in the common
green Grasshopper.'' It does for this writer in O'Connel Street where
he's a sucker for blarney or just the gift of the gab.
Down on Clydeside, research projects at Strathclyde University
attracted #1.2m of extra funding in the first round of the Realising Our
Potential awards run by UK research councils, something the
Strathclyders boast as being twice as much as any other Scots Uni . . .
The projects include research in the electricity supply industry (like
what's happening to Scottish Power shares, we wonder?) information
technology, chemicals industry including polymers, thermoplastics, and
steel, although there is little enough doing in the Scots steel industry
these days.
Among the very hi-tech research work we notice a grant of #101,000 to
Dr Patrick Prosser in Computing Science for ''an empirical study of
constant satisfaction problems''.
Your Frontiersman has been doing that work for nothing, for quite some
time. Hopefully Dr Prosser will come up with the answer. Meanwhile,
we'll still replay the old Stones number, I can't get no . . .

Joe Donnelly scans the hi-tech horizon and finds that mini-radars
could soon be solving all manner of problems -- from parking to tricky
medical examinations
The radar could be sewn into the mattress of a cot to warn parents if
a sleeping baby stops breathing
GOODBYE Reginald Molehusband, and a fond farewell to ladies in Sunday
hats, men in bunnets, skinheads in baseball caps -- in short, all the
people who can't park a car without a scrape, shunt, dunt, or prang.
Parking will no longer be a nightmare (for those on either side of a
vacant space) thanks to a new gadget invented by engineer Tom McEwan.
It's a miniature radar device, expected to cost well under #10, which
puts radar within reach of people outside the military for the first
time since it was invented.
It's known as radar-on-a-chip which works by a system called
micropower impulse radar, a short-range system which uses cheaply
produced microchips. The technology, simplicity itself in scientific
terms, could be the basis for a huge range of appliances and a vast
potential industry.
Tom McEwan, an electrical engineer, developed the radar as part of a
tool used to keep the American national laboratory giant laser in
balance. The micropower pulse was used by scientists to measure the
speed of particles travelling at roughly the speed of light.
But McEwan realised the system could be used for objects travelling at
a lot less than 186,000 miles a second. Those objects include slowly
moving cars which, despite their sloth, can still wreak expensive damage
to other vehicles in the hands of the unsteady or unready.
Built into a car bumper, the radar on a chip consists of a
transmitter, receiver, and a standard microchip for processing the
information. The transmitter sends out a million pulses every second to
distances between a fraction of an inch and 200 feet. The receiver,
embedded in the chip, takes thousands of samples per second, recognising
only the transmitted impulses reflected from another object, like the
car immediately behind, the garage wall, or even a child on a tricycle.
The processor handles the information and decides what's needed, like a
swift foot on the brake.
The micropower impulse radar can focus down to distances of one or two
centimetres, allowing the brave to park in really tight spots. It's also
extremely accurate. The ability of radio waves to bounce off distant
objects was discovered by Hertz just before the end of the last century
and Marconi developed the technology in the 1920s, but it's the
semiconductor explosion that has made miniaturisation possible. Because
of the huge speed of the pulses, super-fast processing is necessary, and
that has only recently become possible at low cost with the improvements
in chip technology.
While thousands of companies are clamouring for a licence to develop
the radar for various systems, one firm has done a deal to incorporate
the system into car safety systems for advanced cruise control and
collision avoidance. A back-up warning for cars, which will be on the
market in less that two years, will start to beep when it gets to within
six inches of another car. A similar use will help eliminate blind-side
dangers, activating an alarm when it detects another car while
lane-changing. Another company, Allied Signal, is working on developing
the chip radar to improve the operation of air-bag safety.
Tom McEwan feels that, like lasers which were exotic and science
fiction mere decades ago but are now used in every CD-player, MIR
technology will be commonplace both at home and in industry. Some
medical researchers believe that simple hand-held lasers will eventually
be standard equipment in every ambulance, hospital, and doctor's
surgery.
One physician who is also an engineer believes the mini-radar will
replace the stethoscope because doctors, instead of just listening to
the beats, will be able to see what's happening inside the valves and
coronary arteries. The medical researchers are working on the design of
radar patches which could be sewn into battle fatigues of fighting and
training troops to monitor vital signs. The same system could be sewn
into the mattress of a baby's cot and programmed to warn parents if a
sleeping baby stops breathing.
''It's turning out to be the Swiss Army knife of new technology,''
says McEwan, who is understandably proud of his invention.
His radar, which fits on to a board the size of a 50p and using tiny
antennae can run on a pair of tiny batteries for as long as eight years.
Within the next year, it is expected to get even smaller when it fits on
to a single computer chip. Among other seemingly magical properties is
an ability to penetrate water, mud, and ice and it is not affected by
temperature or noise, unlike infrared and sonar systems. One outcome is
that it will probably overtake ultra-sound examinations.
Among the thousands of applications described by the companies asking
for licences, are sensors for liquid levels for brewers and ''smart''
washing machines, a hand-held tool to pinpoint wall studs, reinforcing
bars in concrete, and even structural defects. An MIR cruise control
could adjust speed when it detects a slowdown ahead. Because it detects
motion, the tiny radar could be incorporated into smart devices such as
lights that switch on when a room is entered. Hidden from view, it could
enable burglar alarms to see intruders and detect people moving behind
walls, the way Big Arnie could in Terminator, and combined to a central
alarm system could automatically summon the police. It is completely
adjustable for distance and object size so that pets and insects
couldn't trigger it.
Some companies want to use the system to prevent bottom-pinching of
elevator doors (though not for Turkish waiters), for room heaters that
turn off when a child comes too close, more accurate autofocus cameras.
Perhaps it will spot a time-share tout at 40 yards and emit a painfully
piercing discouragement.
For Third World countries recently torn by strife, the McEwan
mini-radar could save hundreds of lives and prevent thousands of
injuries by detecting mines, using a system cheaper than a metal
detector and allegedly 100% accurate.
Of all the little inventions we've catalogued in recent times, this is
probably the one which will have the biggest overall impact on the
forward march of technology.
But for the moment, your Frontiersman will be delighted to see the
thing fitted on the bumpers of all those useless, unco-ordinated nerds
with no distance judgment when it comes to manoeuvring in tight spaces.
Naturally he does not need such a device himself.

SNAPPY NUMBERS
* PENTAX, the camera people, have just launched their Espio 140 which
takes zoom lens technology several steps further. It's a small zoom
compact with a lens that stretches from 38 to a high mag 140mm, the
biggest ever so far on a compact. The Espio comes with autofocus and
metering which is said to deliver clear, sharp shots even through
windows. A switchable panoramic option produces elongated format prints,
and it comes with autoflash, self-timer, and a light-up display panel.
It's on sale for a penny less than #350.
SWISS communication innovators Martigoni Electronics call their latest
innovation the SpiderMan. It is a personal message centre, combining a
digital telephone answering machine, fax/data modem and fax storage and
printing all on a hand-sized unit which operates on a single phone line.
The Spidery thing works in conjunction with PCs but also handles voice
and fax messages when the computer is switched off. The answering and
fax storage functions means that users can leave their office and be
sure that voice and fax messages are stored. It can print faxes
automatically. The unit comes with an intelligent power supply which
powers up the printer when faxes are received, then shuts down at the
end of the job.
Just launched, the Spiderman, which is also a 140000 bps fax modem,
comes in at just under #400, dearer than most modems, but a deal cheaper
than the cost of modem, fax storage, and answering machine combined. It
can hold 20 pages of fax or 60 minutes of voice messages.
* THE traditional game of tig has changed out of all recognition. It's
gone electronic. TIGS is Britain's first Totally Interactive Game Show
which will be able to hook youngsters to participate by logging on to a
central computer from their own homes.
TIGS has been commissioned by CITV who have asked Scottish Television
Enterprises to surf the Internet. Players selected for each show will be
randomly picked by computers and in the studio youngsters will be able
to play computer games, arcade machines, and console games. The show
will have live Internet link-ups with the internet and be able to e-mail
personalities and stars.
One of the most appealing ideas is the dual presenter status, one
human and one just a virtual reality creation. Having seen some kids'
shows, we can only suggest that two computer-generated ones might be
even better.
Playing TIGS will be different from the traditional game, one
supposes. Is there a digital version of . . . You're HET?
* HAVING tried the Logitech cordless mouse, your Frontiersman will not
be going back to one with a tail. For un-techs, the mouse is a computer
tool for pointing out where things go on screen.
Logitech's little rodent is a remote control version without that
fankly wire and its, in tek-talk, a dawdle to use. It works with a
little receiver.
The only possible drawback is that without the wire attaching it to a
PC, you can forget where you left it. Maybe they'll develop a homing
mouse next.
* THE STONES are producing very heavy rock music, and we don't mean
Mick, Keith, and the old team. These are LA Rockers, produced by
stateside company OWI. They're speakers designed to look just like . . .
rocks, and are said to be ideal for open-air parties in the garden where
the speakers can be hidden in the rockery or the border.
They're weather-resistant  plastic but look like the real thing and
come in a variety of geological shades from granite to sandstone and a
cute volcanic metamorphic number. They're expected to be rockin' all
over the UK soon.

For several weeks, there have been rumours of a secret landing in the
West Highlands by Prince Charles, son of the Stuart pretender to the
throne of Great Britain. The Herald has sent a special correspondent,
Michael Fry, to investigate. Today, he writes a first-hand account of
the dramatic scene as the prince raised his father's standard and
launches a rebellion of the clans. The Herald has now commissioned Fry
to ignore personel danger and follow the progress of the prince's
soldiers as they progress to an inevitable clash with the king's army.
We shall also report on the countermoves by the Government in London and
we shall keep our readers abreast of all diplomatic developments across
Europe.
GLENFINNAN, August 19 -- Prince Charles, son of the Stewart pretender
to the crown of Great Britain, today raised his father's standard here
in a Highland fastness, at the head of Loch Shiel 12 miles west of Fort
William.
He signalled the start of a push by the pretender, James VIII and III,
to regain the throne of his ancestors, in a rerun of the rising of 1715
more than 30 years after the otherwise peaceful succession of the House
of Hanover. It can only be an embarrassment, possibly a dangerous one,
to a British Government embroiled in a war against France which this
year has not been going well.
About 1500 armed clansmen, led by their chieftains, cheered the
25-year-old prince, a striking and handsome figure, five feet 10 inches
tall, with brown eyes and sandy hair, dressed in a dun-coloured coat and
a red-laced waistcoat. They threw their bonnets in the air as his
red-and-white silk standard, adorned with the motto Tandem Triumphans, I
Will Win in the End, went up. A Gaelic bard recited an emotional
address. Then the Marquis of Tullibardine, known to the Jacobites as
Duke of Atholl, read a proclamation from the pretender appointing the
prince as regent of the realm and declaring war on King George II.
The prince replied in English, though few of the clansmen understand
it. He said he would strive for their welfare and happiness as much as
for his own rights. He appealed to their honour and the noble example of
their ancestors. He promised to protect both Protestants and Catholics.
Casks of brandy were then broached to drink the pretender's health.
The prince thus brought to a successful end a day which at first
looked likely to end in failure. Only in the evening had he been rowed
15 miles up the loch from Moidart. He was still not sure how many would
rally to him after the appeal he had sent out to the chiefs 11 days ago,
saying he was resolved to restore his father or die in the attempt. He
had also promised religious toleration and offered amnesty to those who
had served King George II, provided they now changed allegiance.
On stepping ashore at Glenfinnan, he kissed the soil. But he found
waiting to greet him only two shepherds, with a few companies of
Clanranald Macdonalds hovering nearby. They were soon joined by 150 men
under Allan Macdonald of Morar. These were certainly not enough to start
a rebellion, however, and the discouraged Charles retired to a hut to
wait.
Then it was learned that the Camerons were coming, under their chief
Donald Cameron of Lochiel. Their arrival could not have been more
dramatic or better stage-managed. The wind bore the distant sound of a
war-pibroch played by skirling pipes. The clansmen, more than 700 of
them, advanced in two lines down a zigzag path at the head of the loch.
In their midst came a dejected party of 80 redcoat prisoners captured in
an ambush. Now the prince felt ready to raise his standard.
The appearance of the Camerons, one of the largest and most powerful
Highland clans, means that the Government in London must take the
situation seriously. It shows that the prince has overcome the first of
his problems, that he arrived in Scotland almost alone.
He has in fact been here for nearly a month. He first touched Scottish
soil on the isle of Eriskay on July 23, and made his way to the west
coast of the mainland two days later, where he has been skulking since.
He landed with only seven men: the Marquis of Tullibardine; Aeneas
Macdonald of Kinlochmoidart, a banker from a local family who has made
his career in France; an Englishman, Francis Strickland of Sizergh,
Cumbria, tutor of Charles's younger brother Henry; Thomas Sheridan, an
Irishman, Charles's own tutor; the Rev George Kelly, an Irish priest who
was out in 1715 and imprisoned for 14 years afterwards; Sir John
Macdonald, another Irishman and former commander of cavalry in the
Spanish service; and Colonel John William O'Sullivan, a fourth Irishman
in the French service. They are already being called the seven men of
Moidart.
Reports of their movements have now reached the Lord President of the
Court of Session, Duncan Forbes, who this week went up from Edinburgh to
his house at Culloden, near Inverness, to keep in touch with the
chieftains, bolster the confidence of the loyal, keep the doubtful in
line and warn the disaffected. Even this last group were dismayed at the
prince's coming without support in men or material from France, which
seemed a bizarre rather than heroic gesture.
So the prince's welcome has been far from a warm one. The first chief
he met, Alexander Macdonald of Boisdale, on South Uist, said bluntly:
''You must go home.''
Charles replied: ''Home? I am come home.''
Two more, Sir Alexander Macdonald of Sleat and Norman Macleod of
Macleod sent messages repeating that without French help he should go
back and await a better chance. But Charles insisted on making contact
with others. His personal appearance in their midst has without doubt
moved them, and some he has won over personally. On July 26 he met
Ranald Macdonald of Clanranald, who said: ''Our hearts were overjoyed to
find ourselves so near our long wished for prince. At his first
appearance I found my heart swell to my very throat.''
When he pleaded for help to Ranald Macdonald of Kinlochmoidart, the
reply was: ''I will! I will! though not another man in the Highlands
should draw his sword, my prince, I am ready to die for you.''
But none of these would have been enough without the key figure of
Lochiel. His brother John Cameron of Fassifern urged him not to see
Charles when the summons came to him as he was planting trees at his
house of Achnacarry on Loch Arkaig. Even so, he felt it his duty to
answer. Their encounter took place at Borrodale House, near Arisaig.
Lochiel stressed that he and other chiefs were still loyal to the
Stewarts, but underlined that they could not be expected to show open
support unless the prince met their condition of bringing aid from
France. Without it there could be no chance of success, so he might as
well return. Charles then told him of his plans for raising the standard
at Glenfinnan, and said: ''Lochiel, who, my father has often told me,
was our firmest friend, may stay at home, and learn from the newspapers
the fate of his prince.''
Lochiel was in his turn overcome with emotion and replied: ''No, I'll
share the fate of my prince and so shall every man over whom nature or
fortune has given me any power.''
The guarantee of support from the Camerons is a turning point in the
prince's expedition. If Lochiel had persisted in his refusal to take
arms, most other chiefs would have stayed at home, and that would
probably have been that. It still cannot be said that Lochiel is
optimistic, and he is reported to have won from Charles a promise that
the income from his estates will be made up to him if he forfeits them.
More doubters were won over by Jacobite victory in the first armed
clash with royal forces three days ago, when the prisoners put on show
at Glenfinnan were taken. As soon as news had reached Edinburgh on
August 2 confirming the prince's landing, Sir John Cope,
commander-in-chief, Scotland, took counter-measures. He dispatched
supplies of arms to the garrison at Inverness, and ordered two companies
of the Royal Scots stationed there to reinforce Fort William. He also
sent a fresh commander to the fort, Captain Sweetenham from the Ruthven
Barracks in Strathspey, but he has been captured by Jacobites holding
the military road at the head of Corriyairack Pass.
Under Captain John Scott, the reinforcements got well down the Great
Glen unmolested, though they sent out no scouts or advance party. On
August 16 they reached the River Spean, two hours' march from their
destination. The bridge was guarded by a scratch force of a dozen,
including a piper, put there by Alexander Macdonald of Keppoch. To
conceal the weakness of his defence, their commander, Donald MacDonell
of Tirandris, ordered the piper to play while his men dashed about in
the undergrowth to create an impression that there were many more of
them.
The sight of the dreaded Highlanders was too much for the redcoats.
They turned round and ran. Harassed by growing numbers of the enemy,
they retreated back along Loch Lochy towards Fort Augustus. Halfway
there they were attacked by a force of Glengarry's clan. Some were
killed and the rest compelled to surrender by Keppoch, who ran up and
told them they would all be cut down unless they did. Lochiel arrived
with a body of his Camerons and carried the prisoners back to
Achnacarry. Not one clansman was hurt in this absurd victory.
Lochiel commented afterwards: ''I can't help thinking that never an
accident of this kind showed more the extraordinary effects of fear than
this, they had marched about a hundred miles and owned themselves
greatly fatigued, yet after all upon seeing a trifling enemy idly throw
away their fire without doing the least execution, and run 12 miles with
incredible speed.''
Lord President Forbes has conceded that the loss of the engagement,
minor as it was, makes the situation worse. He said it would ''elevate
too much and be the occasion of further folly. Two companies of the
Royals made prisoners sounds pretty well and will surely pass for a
notable achievement.'' There can in any case be no doubt of a surge of
popular support for the prince in the Highlands. Sheriff Campbell
reports from Inveraray that ''truly the inhabitants of these countries
are demented, and from all hands I have it they are quite ready to
join''.
For the time being, then, the Government's efforts to nip rebellion in
the bud have failed. This is largely because it lacks the means to
respond firmly enough, given the primitive administration and
communications in the Highlands. The prince, who amid disloyal clans was
beyond the reach of the law, could simply not be stopped from winning
over important chieftains or raising his standard. The problem now is to
see that the disturbances do not get even further out of hand.
They are already beyond the control of the small garrisons at Fort
William, Fort Augustus, and Inverness. General Cope has today marched
from Edinburgh to Stirling, heading for the Great Glen, but has only
about 2000 troops with him. If more are needed, they will have to be
recalled from the campaign against the French in Flanders.
That is the obvious reason why the British Government sees the hand of
Louis XV in this affair. Charles is thought to have been plotting
incognito for a year in France, after slipping away from Rome where his
father has been obliged to live, under the terms of the Treaty of
Utrecht, since 1713. But there is as yet no clear answer to the question
posed by the Highland chiefs, why French support for the prince is not
stronger.
In any event a window of opportunity exists for Louis XV to clinch his
military advantage in Flanders and seize control of the province from
the Emperor of Austria, who has had to rely on British troops to defend
it. After the victory of the French at Fontenoy in May, they could
decisively gain the upper hand by forcing the withdrawal of those
troops. King George II is in Hanover, organising the defence of his
German territories, but is preparing to return to London at once.

For nealry 250 years, the legend of Flora MacDonald has been spiced
with the scent of white heather and woven as colourfully as the
brightest Hebridean plaid. But was the reality as flowery as the myth?
Judy Mackie looks at her turbulent life.
FOR a person who probably expected an uneventful life, Flora MacDonald
had the disquieting habit of being in the right place at the wrong time.
On the first occasion, her innocent sense of timing helped shape
Scottish history and landed her in prison; on the second, it involved
her in a revolution which changed the political face of the western
world and had her fleeing for her life.
Looking at the remarkable story of a seemingly ordinary woman, raised
on the remote Hebridean island of South Uist during the early 17th
century, it is incredible to think she played an active role in two
major historical events.
Not only was she involved in the escape of Charles Edward Stuart from
the aftermath of the Jacobite Uprising of 1745; 30 years later, she
became a catalyst among rebellious emigrant Highlanders in the American
Revolution -- a fact not so widely known or celebrated.
Inevitably, her later adventures were eclipsed by the legend of her
role as the Young Pretender's protector. The story, of the royal rescue
captured the imaginations of generations of folklorists, and myth has
condensed her life into a romantic cameo lasting the 10 days it took to
secure the prince's safety from pursuit by the Loyalist militia.
Myth has also elevated her importance in the action -- but this was no
accident, according to professor Bruce P Lenman, author of two books on
the Jacobite Rebellions and professor of Modern History at the
University of St Andrews.
''Flora herself later complied with London society's romantic idea
that she had a major part to play in the prince's rescue. This was not
immodesty, but rather an indication of her intelligence and ingenuity,
because without a doubt she was covering up for some person in authority
and I would hazard a guess that it was her own clan chief, Ranald
MacDonald, Laird of Clanranald,'' he says.
Professor Lenman believes powerful forces on both sides were at work
behind the simple ruse of dressing Charles up as Flora's maid, ''Betty
Burke'' and taking him by boat from South Uist to Skye, under the nose
of Major General John Campbell and his Scottish troops.
''The prince had become a major embarrassment to everyone concerned.
If he had been captured, what on earth would the Government have done
with him? France would never have put up with him being executed. It's
most likely General Campbell knew what was happening and turned a blind
eye.''
Whoever played the main role in the plot to smuggle Charles back to
France -- and regardless of whether Flora was helping to save his life,
or simply save everyone from a ''major embarrassment'' -- those 10 days
of tension during June 1746 had a dramatic impact on the quiet
24-year-old, whose life until then had been filled with the simple
pursuits typical of the daughter of a gentleman farmer, or tacksman.
According to her own account, given to Jacobite sympathiser Bishop
Forbes in 1747, Flora, who was no Jacobite herself, was frightened by
the prospect of being involved in the prince's escape and took much
persuasion by his companions, Neil MacEachain MacDonald and Colonel
Felix O'Neil, and finally, by Charles himself, before she finally
agreed.
The fateful meeting took place while Flora was visiting her married
brother, Angus -- nearly a year after Charles had landed on Eriskay, on
July 23, 1945. He had since seen hundreds of his followers die a bloody
death at Culloden and there was a price of #30,000 on his head. Far from
being a bonny sight, the 26-year-old fugitive prince was filthy,
freckled by the sun and plagued by midge bites.
On the famous boat journey, instead of keeping watch by his weary head
(as the 1884 Skye Boat Song croons), Flora later recalled that it was
she who slept, while the prince protected her from being stepped on by
the crew.
There was nothing romantic about the arrest and imprisonment of the
rescuers following the escape. While Charles was safe in France, Flora
spent a year in prison -- first on board a series of ships, docking for
a time at Leith, and then in a prison house in London.
There were compensations, however. As a prisoner, Flora became a
celebrity among Jacobite society in Edinburgh and London and by her
release in July, 1747, she was highly accomplished in the social graces.
She returned home from Edinburgh the following summer, having told her
story to Bishop Forbes, who recorded her experienced in The Lyon In
Mourning.
Although a celebrity, Flora followed clan traditions and, at 28,
married Allan MacDonald, a former soldier and son of Alexander
MacDonald, tacksman of Kingsburgh, on Skye.
The couple settled down on the tack of Flodigarry, where five of their
children, Charles, Anne, Alexander, Ranald and James, were born. In
1756, the family moved to Kingsburgh, where Allan carried on the tack
for his widowed father, and their youngest children, John and Fanny,
were born.
In September 1773, Dr Samuel Johnson and his companion James Boswell
paid them a visit during their famous tour of the Highlands and Islands.
Flora's arch teasing of Dr Johnson and her detailed account of her royal
adventure -- not to mention the high quality of the hospitality -- sent
the elderly Englishman and his young Scottish friend away in good
spirits.
Within a year, however, Flora and Allan had succumbed to ''emigration
fever'' and had joined many hundreds of their clan in North Carolina.
The Skye MacDonalds were unwilling to leave the island, but were driven
out by high rent, poor crops and diseased livestock. The couple were
accompanied by two of their sons, Alexander and John, and their married
daughter, Anne, and her family. Their remaining sons were settled in
careers and education and Fanny was placed with a high-standing family
in Raasay.
Any hopes of finding a better way of life were dashed a few months
into their arrival. No sooner had they settled into their new home -- a
plantation in Anson County -- than they became involved in the beginning
of the American Revolution.
Ironically, considering Flora's part in the '45 rebellion against the
British Monarchy, the MacDonalds immediately declared their loyalty to
the British flag. In her book, Flora MacDonald in the Highlands and
America, historian Elizabeth Gray Vining explains their motivation:
''Many of the Scots, like Allan himself, had come to North Carolina
too recently to have developed firm ties to the land. All of them looked
on monarchy as the form of government ordained by heaven and considered
republicanism horrid and unnatural. And finally, they had . . . that
lasting and romantic feeling for Scotland characteristic of Scotsmen
everywhere.''
And so the MacDonalds found themselves in the middle of another
Highland uprising -- against the American republicans. Allan and his
son-in-law, Alexander MacLeod, raised a battalion of Highlanders from
Anson and Cumberland counties, and there is little doubt that the
respect their countrymen had for Flora had a lot to do with their
enthusiasm.
In February 1776, The Highlanders were defeated at the Battle of
Moore's Creek Bridge, and Allan and Alexander captured as
prisoners-of-war. It was two years before Flora saw her husband again,
during which time she had to cope with gangs of plunderers, suffered
chronic ill health, and tried to console her neighbours, who blamed the
famous MacDonalds for their misery. Finally she was forced to leave the
plantation and took refuge with friends in Cumberland county.
The family were reunited in New York in April 1788, but were recalled
by Allan's battalion to Windsor, North Carolina, where Flora spent a
miserable winter, suffering from cold and illness.
Finally, five years after setting sail for the New World, Flora
returned home alone to be reunited with her two daughers -- Anne had
left America earlier to live in London -- and youngest son, John. Her
other four sons were fighting for their country in America, or at sea.
Flora's final years on Skye were full of sorrow. She lost two of her
sons, Alexander and Ranald in 1779; she and Allan, who had finally
arrived home in 1784, had no home of their own and only a meagre amount
of money in compensation, and together with daughter, Fanny, they moved
from island to island, living with relatives.
In her written account of 1789, relaying her adventures with Prince
Charles and in the American Revolution, there is no hint of romance in
her rather bitter conclusion:
''I may fairly say we both have suffered in our person, family and
interest, as much as if not more than any two going under the name of
Refugees or Loyalists, without the Smallest recompense.''
Flora died on March 4, 1790 and was laid to rest at Kilmuir, on the
coast of Loch Snizort, 16 miles north of Kingsburgh. Neither she nor any
of those who helped the Young Pretender escape had ever heard from him
again. Bonnie Prince Charlie, the man who had changed the course of her
life so dramatically, died an alcoholic, in Rome, in 1788.
In the light of such sad and humble endings, it is no surprise that
the majestic figures of romantic myth have long outlasted the real
Charles and Flora in popular memory.

Julian Lloyd Williams charts the story of a Scottish painter with his
sights on ancient Greece and Rome
Gavin Hamilton had an excellent eye -- and a reputation for honesty
GAVIN HAMILTON was not perhaps Scotland's greatest painter nor is he
well-known in his native country. It is true that when Horace Walpole
saw one of the artist's compositions, he pronounced it ''dull and livid,
like all his works''. But if Hamilton failed to impress all with his
pictures, his importance in the history of eighteenth-century European
art far outweighs his artistic ability.
One of the ''founders'' of neo-classic history painting, his
compositions of grand classical themes (which achieved a wide
circulation through the canny production of engravings after them)
inspired the subject matter and designs of numerous artists such as
Antonio Canova, Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Baptiste, Greuze, Tobias
Sergel, Angelica Kauffman, Benjamin West, John Flaxman, and his own
countrymen, David Allan, the Runcimans, and James Nevay.
Hamilton was also one of the foremost art dealers and excavators of
classical sculpture in Rome and his stock found its way into the finest
collections in Britain. His enthusiasm for the antique had a profound
influence upon the taste of more than a generation of painters,
collectors, and cognoscenti throughout Europe.
Gavin Hamilton was born in Lanarkshire in 1723, son of relatively
wealthy parents distantly related to the Dukes of Hamilton. As befitted
a young man of his class, he was well-educated, matriculating to read
Humanities at Glasgow University in 1738 where he would have been
proficient in Latin and Greek. One of the professors, Francis Hutcheson,
had introduced the study of Greek literature to Glasgow's curriculum,
and Hamilton was certainly able to enhance his knowledge of classical
literature and ancient history at the university.
It is not known what prompted his decision to be a painter but his
studies affected what he was to choose to paint and where he chose to
paint it. The Grand Tour was a suitable ''finishing school'' for young
gentlemen and in 1744 Hamilton set out for Rome, the city that was a
''museum indoors, outdoors, and underground'', the best of art and
culture.
Hamilton studied with Agostino Masucci, president of the Rome art
academy, and made friends with like-minded enthusiasts James
''Athenian'' Stuart and Nicholas Revett (who later visited Greece). At
that time, the highest form of painting was believed to be ''historic''
or ''history'' painting, which sought to present ennobling themes chosen
with intellectual rigour.
Though Hamilton had to return to Britain in 1751, and was forced to
paint portraits to earn money, even his sitters had classical leanings,
such as the poet William Hamilton of Bangour who translated Homer from
Greek into English verse. Gavin Hamilton also made ancient literature
more accessible but through paint rather than words. He was one of the
first artists to combine the choice of classical subjects with what was
seen as a sober ''classical style'', instead of frenzied baroque drapery
and histrionic poses.
He returned to Rome in 1756 and started his great series of paintings
whose subjects are taken from Homer's Iliad. Hamilton's Andromache
weeping over the body of Hector was one of the only contemporary
paintings ever praised by the great arbiter of neo-classical taste, J J
Winckelmann, who noted that the figures, ''intelligently thought out and
conceived with taste'', were ''very close to Grecian forms''.
The culmination of Hamilton's career in Rome was a complex decorative
scheme of eight paintings devoted to the story of the Greek lovers Paris
and Helen (1782-4), integrated with related sculpture in a room in the
Villa Borghese, the most lavish new private house in Rome. At long last
he had completed a proposal originally made for Yester House in 1755, to
paint a room ''with some great heroic subject so as to fix the attention
of the spectator''.
More successful than any other British history painter in Rome,
Hamilton's studio was also a shop for old-master paintings and antique
sculpture -- he had an excellent eye and a reputation for honesty. His
sales included Leonardo da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks and the Burrell
Collection's Warwick Vase which he had excavated from a drained lake at
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. The famous collection of Townley marbles at
the British Museum was inspired by Hamilton's advice to Charles Towneley
that ''in spite of the sneers of a tasteless age . . . the most valuable
acquisition that a man of refined taste can make is a piece of fine
Greek sculpture''.
Reportedly the ''unsolicited friend of every deserving artist'', Gavin
Hamilton was praised by a fellow Scot, John Aikman, as ''a sweet blooded
gentleman and the most renowned of all history painters in Rome''.
If all roads lead to Rome, then Hamilton's idiosyncratic route lay via
Glasgow and ancient Greece. He died in the Eternal City on January 4,
1798, little known in Scotland but an instigator of change in the way
taste was perceived in Europe, just as Europe itself was changing at the
dawn of the industrial age.

YOU experience a whole new world from the top deck of a bus. During my
brief reign as bureau chief in the Edinburgh office of this illustrious
journal I got to know the city -- surely the most spectacularly set
capital in Europe -- by grabbing the first dinner-time bus passing by
and following the route as far as my fancy took me. Festival time was a
particular joy.
One hot August afternoon I even joined an excited and motley crew of
visitors on an open-topped city bus tour to acquire what Ian Bell
recently and accurately described as ''dubious historical nuggets''.
In the High Street, my neighbour, a charming but wrinkled wifie from
Idaho whose ancestors surely scared the loincloth off many a Sioux
warrior, snapped away happily. On one side a pipe band gave it laldie, a
fire-eater sent his dragon's breath high into the afternoon air, and a
top-heavy, two-legged giraffe bounced along beside St Giles' thrusting
Fringe leaflets at the throng of passers-by. Simply put, the place was
jumpin'.
To no-one in particular I remember my companion announcing: ''Gee, I
just never thought Edinburg could be as colourful as this!''
And why not, missus? Why not? Did she believe the propaganda that
there's more fun at a Glasgow funeral than an Edinburgh wedding?
Edinburgh, dour, grey capital of the north hates the Festival, I've
heard it whispered by churlish individuals who should know better. It's
a myth badly in need of scotching. Real Edinburgh folk know how to
boogie with the best of them.
Even the cold hand of the reformers failed to squeeze the life out of
popular enthusiasm for a bit of street theatre. Witness the famous Robin
Hood Riot of 1561.
The Robin Hood plays dated far back into Scottish history, perhaps
even to pagan times, and consisted of a series of ''unruly, dramatic
games'', getting dressed up in all sorts of outlandish gear and
generally letting yourself go. Obviously this did not go down well with
the earnest fathers of the new Kirk and the event was banned.
Ignoring the edict the merry men gathered as usual and marched
defiantly up the Castle Hill. This wouldn't do at all. Magistrates made
only one arrest -- a servant called James Gillon -- and decided to make
an example of him, to bring the celebration to an end once and for all.
A date for his execution was set.
On the appointed day, however, the craftsmen took to the streets
kitted out for violent action and after making citizens' arrests, and
throwing the provost and the bailies into a booth they smashed open the
Tolbooth and freed Gillon. A major civil confrontation was averted when
the Constable of the Castle negotiated a peace deal after six hours of
disturbances.
Despite a constant and reasonable demand that the twentieth-century
Festival should strive to become more available and relevant to ordinary
citizens, Edinburgh without its Festival is now unthinkable. When
Glasgow cheekily toyed with the idea of poaching the event a few years
back the Capital's provost poured scorn on the proposal, suggesting that
the upstart Western metropolis would want the Castle next. Not a bad
idea.
Come to think of it, wouldn't the Scott Monument look neat in the
middle of Kelvingrove Park?

The Herald team of regular reviewers tune in to the latest sounds
Sibelius: The Complete Symphonies (Finlandia Records)
* TWO years ago the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, with its
principal conductor Jukka-Pekka Saraste at the helm, gave a set of
performances of the seven symphonies of Sibelius in the Great Hall of St
Petersburg. They were recorded live, and are now issued on a three-CD
set on Finlandia Records, a division of Warner Music.
Live recordings can be the dodgiest game in the business; these are
excellent, with -- and this is instinctive -- a real concert hall feel
to the balance, immediacy to the performances (quite audibly recorded in
a hall with a superb acoustic), and little trace of studio interference.
Astonishingly there are few glitches -- though the Finnish trumpets,
reaching into their boots for the low notes near the opening of the
Fifth Symphony, are almost in trouble. The occasional imprecise entries
-- a concomitant of any live performance -- are so minor they can be
lived with.
Jukka-Pekka Saraste (a former principal conductor the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra) is a familiar character in these parts. We know his dynamic
style -- and he produces some searing performances from his Finnish
troops. What will surprise here is the breadth Saraste displays -- at
the climax to the First Symphony he draws out and holds the big tune,
rather than driving it forward. An impressive collection, at under #30
firmly in the mid-price category, and well worth having.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Winter Truce (and Homes Ablaze), Django Bates (JMT)
* THE further adventures of Bates's quartet, Human Chain, and the
larger Delightful Precipice continue to juxtapose the ridiculous with
the sublime, with a chaotic New York, New York (yes, that one) prefacing
the gorgeous, devotional Early Bloomer. Once again, however, the magic
supersedes the mayhem, although even at his zaniest Bates remains a
colossal keyboards, composing and arranging talent.
East of Hoy, Shake the Shack (Shake the Shack)
* THE Borders-based fivesome present an endearing selection of capably
played and adequately sung songs. Often decidedly dippy but occasionally
socially aware (well, almost), they embrace a range of influences and
instruments that may well make them the missing link between the
Incredible String Band and the Beverley Hillbillies.
Seidean Si, Paddy Glackin &amp; Robbie Hannan (Gael Linn)
* ELEVEN fiddle and uileann pipes duets, interspersed with two solos
each from two of Ireland's finest musicians. The duets -- all masterly,
catch us if you can stuff -- are so tight that it's almost impossible to
separate the instruments, which makes Glackin's solo slow air all the
more powerfully expressive.
The Complete Capitol/Black &amp; White Recordings,T-Bone Walker (Capitol)
* ALTHOUGH best known for Stormy Monday, Walker was no one-song wonder
and as a singer and guitarist in the U40s he led the way in combining
bluesU primitiveness with jazzy sophistication. This three CD set may
represent a hefty investment now but this is timeless music and in ten
years it'll seem like a bargain.
ROB ADAMS
The Complete Recordings, The Classic Jazz Quartet (Jazzology, JCD 139)
* LIKE Soprano Summit, who re-formed in front of our very eyes at the
Edinburgh Jazz Festival's Gala Concert, the Classic Jazz Quartet was an
all-too-short-lived band which featured the many talents of Marty Grosz.
In the early eighties, the guitarist and vocalist teamed up with Dick
Sudhalter (cornet), Joe Muranyi (clarinet and soprano sax) and Dick
Wellstood (piano) to continue the traditions of twenties and thirties
jazz.
This new double CD contains their two albums (from 1984 and 1985) plus
previously unissued live recordings from 1986, the year before
Wellstood's sudden death killed off the band.
Highlights are plentiful: the wonderfully evocative Blue River;
Mississippi Mud sung in German by the full quartet; Wellstood's
brilliant Wallerish stride on Strut Miss Lizzie (if Waller and Bix
Beiderbecke had ever played together, the result might have sounded like
this); Sudhalter's wistful cornet on I'll Never Be The Same and Grosz's
dazzling guitar on You're Driving Me Crazy.
Altogether a gem.

James Laing explains how Perthshire has extended its holiday season
beyond September
IT is a land of fertile plains and majestic mountains forged ages ago
when the Ice Age performed its massive task. It lies at the heart of
Scotland and holds within its borders some of the most beautiful and
rugged scenery in the world. It is called Perthshire.
Here a visitor can catch a glimpse of a stag high on a mountainside
guarding his herd of hinds from the challenges of younger males. A quiet
walk by a crystal clear river tumbling over ancient rocks can reveal the
flash of a big salmon turning in the current.
Further north in Highland lochs ornithologists and ordinary people can
see and marvel at the fishing skills of the now thriving colonies of
ospreys. There is all this and more to see and visit in the 2000 square
miles of Perth and Perthshire. It is an area steeped in history, a
stately and vivid county, with activities to suit all tastes and age
groups.
A major push is being made into the English market where cheap package
holidays abroad are being challenged for business. Many families can now
afford two holidays a year -- one in the sun and another short break in
the UK.
Perthshire's prime objective is to make a big effort to pursue
first-time visitors to the area in the certain knowledge that one visit
will never be enough to see all of the treasures of one of the loveliest
places in Britain.
This year the area, which also includes the old county of Kinross, is
one of the partners in a national initiative to promote short-break
holidays from the end of September to the end of November this year.
The promotion is called ''Autumn Gold'' and is offering big savings on
a whole range of facilities ranging from three-night breaks for the
price of two in some hotels to discounts on meals and attractions.
In recent years all over Scotland the basic quality of food, bar
lunches, high teas, dinners and even snacks has improved by leaps and
bounds. And nowhere more so than in Perthshire. Hoteliers have realised
that their first priority to attract visitors must be price based. Now
bargain breaks are becoming increasingly available at affordable prices
for couples and families.
Patrick Laughlin, the depute director of tourism for Perthshire, is an
enthusiast for his area. He moved from a city-based job to Perthshire
nine years ago and he can still be astonished at some of the scenic and
historic treasure he can unearth in his travels around the county and
its towns and villages.
There is not a hamlet which cannot offer some fascinating diversion
for a tourist whether it be the local distillery or an ancient tree
where, in the not-so-distant past, sheep stealers were chained and
eventually hanged for their misdemeanours.
A recent survey found almost 50 different sporting and leisure
activities for the more athletic visitors. A total of 120 separate
attractions for less sportingly inclined visitors have also been
identified. For the more leisured approach there are two top class
theatres which have gained national reputations for theirexcellence.But
it is the quality of the area which brings people back -- and it not
just the quality of the accommodation with a whole range of hotels and
guest houses to suit most pockets but the warmth of the welcome the
people extend to tourists.

It can cost a fortune but is it worth it for a little extra leg room
and a few freebies? It is if you choose wisely, believes Katie Wood
I AM the worst person in the world to ask if it's worth paying extra
for the pleasures of Business Class. Yesterday I spent 11[1/2] hours
wedged between a teething infant and an ample Caribbean lady on a
charter flight back to London from Jamaica. By hour six I'd cheerfully
have sold my body and mortgaged the house for an upgrade; but I was on a
one-class charter, and that was my lot.
Queues for the loos took on average 15 minutes; my seat next to the
door on the aircraft was freezing -- and the requested blanket when it
came was the size of a hand-towel; the food was obscenely bad; you had
to buy headsets, and with the ignominy of having to pay for a soft drink
still sharp in my mind on came the inane one-channel video.
I know 11[1/2] hours is a short blip in a lifetime; but at the time --
like childbirth -- it's all that matters, and it feels a hell of a lot
longer.
The average price differential between an APEX Economy ticket and a
Business Class scheduled airfare is running at around 60%. That's a lot
of money so it does beg the question if it's really worth the extra.
Well, the answer's obvious enough if you're a corporate bod whose
company is picking up the tab, but what about when it's coming out your
wallet?
It's a lot to pay for generally less than a day's pampering, and nice
as it is to have champagne before take-off, china, not plastic, to eat
off, and name recognition when your glass is refreshed, is it worth that
serious amount of money?
As a short and basic answer, the reply has got to be yes if it's a
long arduous inter-continental flight and the airline gives you enough
goodies and freebies to make it worthwhile. But generally it's not worth
it if it's a short hop over the Channel and you're flying with a bunch
of miserable operators whose idea of Business Class is a second-rate
toiletry bag and your coat being hung up. And, believe me, these do
exist.
There are a range of carrots used by airlines to persuade you to come
up with a Business Class fare, but the reason most companies still
choose to upgrade has nothing to do with whether their budding exec
would prefer a nice Chardonnay from the bottle rather than a plastic
Liebfraumilch miniature. No, it's as boring as is the flexible return
date. You can chop and change your return all you like, you're still
guaranteed a seat if space is available. And for a businessperson on a
trip of indeterminate length, that's a huge advantage.
But given that this is common to all airlines in Business, what are
the other incentives that have pulling power in making you choose one
airline over another? That's where the entirely frivolous things like
in-flight aromatherapy; free limo transfers; advance seat selection;
free hotel rooms; good food and wines; toiletry bags stuffed with
mini-size goodies, and improved in-flight entertainment come in. And all
these little things add up to a far more pleasant flying experience.
Broadly, you can classify the airlines of this world in four leagues:
in descending order of superiority on a continental basis, Far Eastern
airlines come tops; European second; North American and Antipodean
third; and African and Central and South American ones fourth. There are
exceptions; South African Airlines is certainly not bottom of the
league, and Malaysian and Korean Airways aren't up there with Cathay and
Singapore Airlines.
What surprises many people is that the ''Have a nice day'' North
American philosophy doesn't necessarily translate into airline personnel
training manuals. USAir makes a good attempt, but the majority of
American airlines have indifferent flight attendants; second-rate
toiletries, cliched entertainment, and boring food -- and they charge
handsomely for it. No American or Canadian airline is truly marvellous
(Air Canada is as good as it gets). Many European ones aren't that great
either, but, for once, we Brits can afford a bit of drum-banging and
self-congratulations, because as a veteran of more than 50 airlines on
all continents I can honestly say, hand-on-heart, that I find British
Airways hard to beat.
In the past decade they have transformed their service and now offer a
great Business Class product; genuinely friendly but not sycophantic
staff; impressive food and drink; good seat-back in-flight
entertainment, and loads of leg-room. Their latest ploys are sleeper
suits (in-flight PJs), in-flight phones, and from later this year a new
Club World seat. Entering service in the autumn it has been designed for
''taller and broader'' customers. So the message is if your behind is of
the ample variety, fly BA. But honestly an extra few inches makes all
the difference . . . So, what deals and new incentives are around this
summer? And, more importantly, who should you avoid?
In terms of the latter, in pride of place has got to be Aeroflot --
the world's worst airline. Apart from the surly staff who serve you food
the pet wouldn't eat, their safety record is, as everyone knows, not
exactly the best.
Also avoid Zambia Airways and Ethiopian Airlines -- though if you fly
with them, be sure you do upgrade to Business Class as only then will
you get anything that equates with what you're used to on your holiday
charter.
LIAT is another name to confine to ''holiday hell'' file. Well-known
in the Caribbean by the acronym ''Leave Island Any Time'', if you have
deadlines to meet, forget this inter-island airline. Another no-no
should be Air Guatemala. Alitalia (despite its current offer of a free
night's accommodation in Turin and Bologna) is notoriously bad for
long-haul service. Olympic, the Greek national carrier, and Bulgaria's
Balkan Air are also definite no-nos.
Moving on to some airlines you might just want to fly with, though,
Iberia relaunched its Business Class in 1993, and not a minute too soon.
Today the Spanish national carrier offers telephone check-in for hand
baggage passengers and advanced seat selection as well as a specific
Business Class number for making changes to your bookings.
Lufthansa is refurbishing its Business Class in the autumn. Satellite
telephones, and ''space-age sleep suits'' are the current perks. But the
German airline, like Sabena the Belgian carrier, is still, overall,
disappointing for such efficient and service-orientated countries.
Air France is so marvellously rude and obnoxious that it's almost
worth going with it for the floorshow. Still, it's currently offering a
free two-night half-board stay at Gleneagles or a mixed case of fine
wines and champagne for anyone booking two Edinburgh-Paris return trips
in Business Class, plus a week's free car parking at Edinburgh Airport,
so you may well want to consider that one (staff do seem friendlier on
the Edinburgh run!).
* Maersk, the privately-owned Danish carrier, is offering upgraded
tickets on the Gatwick Express and Thameslink BT service. And it also
has a spouse fare for Business Class passengers.
* Swissair (which is excellent) has increased flight attendants for
even more personal service.
* Transavia, which operates Gatwick-Amsterdam, is offering a free
hotel stay on the last flight daily and on all Sunday flights.
* British Airways is offering a Spouse fare whereby a married couple
can enjoy Business Class travel with one paying full fare and other
spouse going half-price (this also applies to it's flights to South
Africa).
* SAS is offering a free night's accommodation in Scandinavian
Radisson hotels for any Business Class passenger with a 30% discount on
subsequent nights.
Outwith Europe, some nice perks are offered by Air New Zealand. A free
case of award-winning NZ wine before September 1. For a flight of this
magnitude, if you can afford it, go for it.
No point flying El Al if you're looking to earn frequent flier points
on the back of your travels -- not unless you carry an Israeli or US
passport because for some obscure reason they're the only ones they
recognise on their scheme.
If you're flying to the Middle East, you are far better opting for one
of the best airlines out -- Emirates. Among its accolades are ''Best
long-haul airline in the world'' and ''Best food-and-drink airline'' --
not bad for a carrier that's only been running nine years.
Once you've been sated in excellent food (six courses) and drink, and
your every need has been attended to, they send you on your way with a
complimentary gift of crystal or china. All that plus they give you a
free economy round-trip for every full-fare First or Business Class
passenger between London and Dubai.
If it's fabby freebies you're after, try Royal Brunei which has the
most luxurious toiletry set -- designer labels in a maroon velvet beaded
drawstring bag that would look at home as an evening bag in any
ballroom.
On a slightly more practical note it also offers a free companion
fare, #25 shopping voucher for Heathrow Harrods store, and a stopover in
Singapore and Dubai free of charge.
Closer to home Northwest Airlines, despite its poor showing in Holiday
Which?, has a free limo transfer to a 65-mile radius of Glasgow if you
cross the pond with it -- about the best incentive out for Scots these
days following the demise of American links from Glasgow. But for
transatlantic flying, Virgin is hard to beat; good food, efficient
service, brilliant in-flight entertainment and tempting freebies.
Aer Lingus has some strong competition in the form of a free limo
collection for their Business Class passengers anywhere within a 40 mile
radius of Glasgow. You'll also be dropped off within a 40-mile radius of
JFK. Continental Airlines has possibly the most comprehensive offers
just now to entice you to Business Class.
* Free limo from home to London Gatwick or Manchester (up to 50
miles), or (of more interest to Scots), to destinations at other end up
to 50 mile radius.
* Free overnight hotel in UK or USA.
* #140 worth of travellers' cheques on production of a certificate
available from Sales when purchasing Business First ticket.
* Companion Fare -- one pays full-fare; other travels free.
Its Gatwick to New York Newark current return fare is on special offer
at #1350 (usually #2650).
Another tempting offer if you're going Down Under comes from
Australian flag carrier Qantas. It is offering free regional add-on
flights to London for its Business Class passengers.
DESCENDING COSTS
* AVIATION fuel is at its lowest cost for several years and,
relatively, airfares are cheaper than they were two or three years ago.
Business Class is booming as a result. It's interesting to note that
many airlines are scrapping First Class in favour of a two-tier system
of Business and Economy. The exception is in the Far East -- Taiwanese
''China Airlines'' has four classes! Virgin has three though none are
First -- Business, Full Fare Economy, and Economy.

* THE warning of insecticides in carrots earlier this year has sparked
a revival of interest in organic produce. Though no longer stocked in
Marks &amp; Spencer and Asda, organic produce is available in Sainsbury's,
Safeway and Tesco with some growers reporting a 5% increase in sales.
Home-produced organics hould not be much more expensive than
conventional produce, says Sue Gerard, of Gerards of Damhead, 33a
Damhead, Old Pentland Road, Lothian Burn, Edinburgh.
''Organically produced fruits and vegetables,'' says Garth Gulland of
Roots and Fruits, Great Western Road, Glasgow, ''should not be judged by
conventional standards. Because they are grown slower, they have a more
concentrated flavour. People complain that organic potatoes take longer
to cook, but that's because they have less water and therefore more
flavour.'

GOLF ANECDOTES
Robert T. Sommers
Oxford University Press, #16.99
INVARIABLY, the heart misses a beat when the matter of golf stories
raises its baleful head. On a scale of one to 10 they tend to have a
high boredom ratio, the original sin probably being the one about the
club member who went to the chairman of the greens committee to complain
about the inferior quality of the cabbage at lunch that day.
There are always exceptions to any rule, however. The best recent tale
to indulge this sceptical heart was told by Bernard Gallacher. As the
1993 Ryder Cup match slipped from Europe's grasp into that of the United
States the captain asked Severiano Ballesteros to commiserate with
Costantino Rocca, the first Italian to play in the event, who had lost a
game he seemed about to win.
Later, Gallacher asked Rocca what had happened. Rocca replied that
Ballesteros, for whom winning the match has taken on the importance of
recovering the Holy Grail, had approached with tears in his eyes. To
which emotional state Rocca had responded, as though he were the stoical
veteran of the occasion: ''Never mind, Seve, we'll win the next one.''
That paradoxical story does not appear in this collection, but only
because Gallacher has only just revealed it. And, anyway, this
anthologist, Robert Sommers, is too wily a bird to be drawn into the
minefield through which those condemned to the after-dinner speaking
circuit are obliged to pick their way as delicately as any Agag.
The customary yawn can be given to H L Mencken's assertion that public
office should be denied to any person who has played golf -- a canard of
irrational malice, since this game, above all others, entrusts to its
participants a basic degree of integrity to which politicians of any
stripe seem constitutionally incapable of aspiring, or desiring.
Sommers, as befits one who has written golf for more than 40 years,
has attempted to illuminate, rather than muddy, the waters with this
320-page collection -- backed, thank goodness, by a comprehensive index.
To be sure, as a publication originally of American origin, the
preponderance of stories is transatlantic. Their source, however, does
not diminish their appeal.
The put-down is always agreeable. Thus the 18-year-old Bobby Jones,
who was partnering Harry Vardon, then aged 50, in the 1920 US open,
thinned an approach through the green into a bunker. Hugely embarrassed,
the youngster attempted some damage limitation to his self-respect by
saying to the great man on the next tee: ''Mr Vardon, have you ever seen
a worse shot?'' ''No,'' came the reply.
Even Ben Hogan, the bleak critic of whatever failed to match up with
his stern seal of approval, was once memorably put in his place. Playing
at the exclusive Seminole club in Florida, of which he was a member, he
complained that the greens were too slow. His partner, the club's
president, sharply responded: ''If you didn't take so much time to putt,
the grass wouldn't grow that long.''
