SCOTLAND is a trading nation. From quality food and whisky to the 77%
export rate of the electronic sector, the country lives by selling
beyond its borders. Even if the future lies with software and financial
services, they will have to be exported to maintain our economic well
being. Trade is dynamic, demanding new modes of transport, delivery
times, destinations and reliability. Just-In-Time manufacturing, the
Channel Tunnel's opening, the growth of telecommunications, rail
privatisation . . . these and other changes add pressure to Scotland's
transport infrastructure. Parts of that infrastructure are struggling to
cope. Road congestion lengthens delivery times, tightening production
schedules. Attempts to run freight trains direct to Paris fail. Today
the Scottish Chambers of Commerce host a conference on transport
infrastructure at the SECC in Glasgow. Without the politicians who
failed to deliver an integrated transport policy, it is the business
community's chance to fill the gap. The Herald today sets out some of
the key issues of both infrastructure and services. Our standard of
living depends on wealth generated by arteries of land, sea and air
linking us to the world; our quality of life depends on whether the
arteries flow freely or clog up and stop. Bill Knox and Francis Shennan
report
TRANSPORT is a pan-Scottish subject declares Geoff Runcie, the chief
executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and the man who first started
the ball rolling for today's conference.
''Transport is one of Scotland's challenges,'' he said. ''We are on
the periphery of the United Kingdom, on the periphery of Europe, in fact
on the periphery of the world. In terms of sea, air, rail or road
transport, we are out on a limb. Transport is vital to us as a nation.
We have some good infrastructure but it has never been properly pulled
together into a coherent system in recent times.''
The final document to be prepared at the end of today's conference
discussions will, he believes, amount to a business view approach
towards a strategic plan for Scotland's transport infrastructure -- and
one the Scottish Chambers feel is vital to the future of Scotland.
Several hundred delegates will attend, from major figures in the
business community to individual delegates who have their own particular
viewpoint.
''It will not be a 'sit down and listen' style conference. It will be
a sit down and talk occasion, and that on its own will make a refreshing
change.''
The idea which led to today's conference began in the early part of
1994. Geoff Runcie who had taken his chief executive post the previous
year after a career in heavy engineering sales and marketing, had for
some time felt that transport was one of Scotland's challenges. It was a
feeling which in part was a result of years of daily travel up and down
the A77 road from Ayrshire.
He felt it offered a way in which the Chambers could take an
initiative in an important style. His belief was shared by Ian Brown,
chief executive of Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce and initial informal
discussions centred on how the Chambers could tackle such a huge and
complex subject.
''A careful sampling of members resulted in the decision that the
transport conference could be viable. The proposed shape that evolved,
including four 'breakaway' afternoon sessions, combined with the need
for parking and transport facilities for delegates attending from all
over Scotland, made the SECC in Glasgow an obvious choice of venue.
A total of 125,000 invitations were sent out to leaders of Scotland's
business community.
''On the one hand, I was delighted at the eager response from many,''
said Geoff Runcie. ''On the other hand, I was disappointed at the
response or lack of response from so many others who seemed apathetic
about a subject which is so important to everyone. But the several
hundred delegates who will be attending include most of the leaders in
their respective fields even if other businesses seem challenged by a
lack of time or plead a lack of resources, both people and financial.''
Yet the Scottish Chambers feel the conference is vital because there
is no coherent Scottish transport infrastructure in place and that it is
vital the final paper prepared from today's discussions should go
forward to the Scottish Office and to Government in addition to forming
a suggested transport manifesto for all political parties.
''At the end of the day, the people who finance most of the public
sector with regard to infrastructure developments are the business
community in one form or another. Independent of the political system,
we want to prioritise what exists and highlight those that are missing
then point ways forward to make the best possible use of the transport
infrastructure.
''We want to see that infrastructure in place, to see it fully used,
and also to see a commitment to an on-going funding of the continuing
development of the infrastructure.''
He points out to the road, rail and ports infrastructure laid down by
the Victorians ''from which we benefit'' as an example of how, in the
past, all the various factors involved were carefully brought together
and developed.
''At this conference, delegates from all the various interests present
will have a chance to bounce ideas off one another, not in terms of
fighting their own corners but in search of overall benefits. We want
people to pull together rather than have them pulling in different
directions. Remember that all of us rely on the transport infrastructure
-- and that includes as a prime example our vital tourist industry.''
This may be the first Scottish Chambers' conference of its kind, but
the organisers are already expressing the hope that others may follow.
''This time, we are focusing on the infrastructure of transport, but
after that another and similar conference might well concern itself with
the service level of transport in all its forms. Infrastructure is the
key piece -- once that's in place, everything else can be planned on top
of it.
''What we will be attempting to bring together is at present too
fragmented, too local or too regionally focused as a picture. For
success, it must become carefully and centrally planned. We are all
transport users or transport providers and the final document which
emerges from the day's discussion will be a valuable paper.''
Four weeks from now the final version is scheduled to be available.
''I believe that it will identify the real opportunities that exist,
with so much good infrastructure in place already to be integrated and
then identifying the job to be finished.
''That will play a major part in the efficiency of our economy, make a
positive and beneficial effect on the environment by bringing together
what are interlocking interests -- and shape the new culture change
which is necessary to bring the transport gridlock to an end.''

ROADS carry around 150 million tonnes of goods uplifted in Scotland
every year and nearly all of Scotland's imports and exports at some
point during their journey.
But they also carry four-fifths of incoming raw materials for industry
throughout the whole of the journey and nearly three-fifths of outgoing
goods.
Yet fuel taxes and vehicle excise duty make British road hauliers most
heavily taxed in the European Union. Unlike their continental
competitors they cannot even claim rebates for the road tolls charged in
many European countries.
Fuel taxes affect Scotland more than the rest of the UK because of its
peripheral position and its widely spread population. The Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution's recommendation for higher fuel
taxes will only widen the gap.
A toll per motorway mile would severely handicap Scotland, with
motorway users outside the central belt paying for congestion elsewhere
and trucks travelling from Scotland through England facing prohibitive
bills.
But a toll per mile of congested motorway, with payments for using
busy motorways in and around conurbations, would be fairer. Scottish
hauliers would pay only for the congested M25 and motorways around
Birmingham and Manchester, along with English competitors, but not for
empty stretches through Cumbria and the Borders.

SCOTLAND'S ROADS
The M8 through Glasgow is so congested that time is lost in the
transport of goods; an M74 northern extension would relieve pressure
WHILE work on the M77 extension continues despite the high-profile
protests, plans for another -- potentially more important -- motorway
extension are being considered. Any delay in this one could seriously
threaten jobs, according to an influential industry group.
The M74 extension would complete what is known as the Glasgow
''motorway box'' by linking with the M8 and providing a second motorway
route across the Clyde.
John Henderson, chief executive of SPEED (the Scottish Partnership for
Effective and Economic Distribution), is angry at the lack of public
attention so far to the M74 plans.
''The application for planning permission for the M74 Extension in
January must be welcomed by all of industry and by the Scottish public
who wish to see Scotland's economic well-being maintained and
developed,'' he argues.
SPEED was formed five years ago to represent Scottish manufacturers on
transport, distribution and logistics. Its first members were mainly in
electronics which both works to tight deadlines and exports 77% of its
output.
Since then membership has broadened to other sectors to include
service and infrastructure providers, and development agencies. At the
same time Just In Time manufacturing techniques based on low inventories
have spread to become commonplace.
''The times when raw materials and finished product deliveries were
made without the pressures of Just In Time and very short order
fulfilment times are a thing of the past,'' said Henderson.
''To be able to operate effective manufacturing and to service
customers properly the logistics element has got to be totally
dependable and undertaken in as short a time as practically possible.
''Failure to achieve reliable distribution threatens the very
existance of our manufacturing base, resulting in the loss of orders to
our more efficient competitors elsewhere.
''Within Scotland this threat is even greater due to our peripheral
geographical position and we therefore have to focus more effectively on
the transport infrastructure than our competitors who are closer to the
main markets.''
The bulk of Scotland's electronic exports goes to mainland Europe.
Although incoming raw materials and outgoing finished goods travel by
different modes of transport, road is the common connection.
As well as linking plants with rail terminals and air and sea ports,
it is still the sole method of transport for most journeys of materials.
''For companies in the west central belt of Scotland practically every
material movement requires to move across the centre of Glasgow,'' said
Henderson. ''The reliability of the single M8 link fails to meet the
demands which industry now requires.''
Distribution times for the electronic data processing industry are two
to three days. For the semiconductor industry they are 24 to 36 hours.
''This demands the very latest cut-off time at the despatch bay to meet
the timing of aircraft, rail services or ferry sailings,'' he said.
Many companies had reported to SPEED that these cut-off times have had
to be brought forward by at least an hour in the past few years due to
road congestion. ''This means that less of the day's manufacturing can
be allocated to time-definite sales.
''The completion of a motorway box round the centre of Glasgow would
dramatically relieve this and take a large percentage of lorries off the
Kingston Bridge and Charing Cross section of the M8.''
Extending the M74 would free a way to the main trunk route to England
for one of Scotland's main export areas, Renfrewshire. The largest
percentage of electronic products by volume originate west of the
Kingston Bridge from companies such as IBM and Compaq. The same is true
of other sectors such as whisky.
Raw materials also have to reach these companies by road. ''This also
places demands on traffic moving north and west into Renfrewshire,
Inverclyde and Dunbartonshire,'' said Henderson. ''Considerable
additional industry throughout Scotland is affected by the road
infrastructure in Glasgow.
''There is also the time sensitive air freight into and out of Glasgow
and Prestwick airports that goes to manufacturers east of the Kingston
Bridge. These manufacturers experience the same earlier cut-offs due to
road congestions.''
There is a 50-50 chance that air freight will be driven through
Glasgow twice, because half of it travels to Manchester or London
airports as carriers even-out their loads and make the best use of their
cargo holds.
Henderson said some air cargo services have recently transferred to
Edinburgh partly because they offered better cut-off times to shippers.
''From our experience of industry in Scotland, we do not have the time
available to enter into extended public inquiries into the M74 extension
without the clear danger of losing key manufacturing and distribution
jobs to mainland Europe,'' he said.
''Scotland has already seen some industrial investment from
established multinational companies in Scotland lost to continental
locations due in part to the distribution infrastructure.
''In many potential new investments the logistics issue plays a key
part in the decision-making process. Not only is this a major threat to
the electronics sector.''

Russia 0, Scotland 0
Moscow,
THERE was not a single Scot on the Luzhniki Stadium turf at the end
who did not appear exhausted. However, each one of Craig Brown's players
deserved to be delighted with their night's work in Moscow where the
locals who made up all but several hundred of the 25,000-strong audience
jeered their players at the end.
The Russians, who had taken almost a week in Germany to prepare for
last night's crucial European Championship Group 8 qualifying tie, were
expected to enhance their prospects of reaching the finals in England
next summer, but Brown's side had other ideas.
The Scots shrugged off the problems they had faced when the squad was
undermined because of injuries and withdrawals and refused to play a bit
part in the match. Indeed, they restricted the Russians, who selected
from a full squad, to a few untidy chances especially towards the end of
the game when the locals, scattered around the massive but dilapidated
stadium, began to lose faith. Russia's work became more erratic and
ungainly as the match progressed and the point gained by Scotland has
certainly resurrected their own hopes of qualification.
This was Scotland's fifth game in the qualifying series and they moved
on to eight points whereas the Russians, having played three matches,
are two points worse off, but perhaps the most significant aspect of
last night's draw is that the Russians simply must start collecting
points if they are to make it to England, and that can only be to
Scotland's benefit.
The Greeks lead the group with maximum points from four games, but
their next outing will be on April 26 when the Russians will be the
visitors to Athens. Obviously, that match will be extremely important
and if the Russians can improve their form, as they surely will, both
these sides -- the Greeks are still to play in Moscow -- could take
points from one another.
While the Greeks and the Russians are battling it out, Scotland will
be playing San Marino in Bologna and Brown's side are bound to collect
three points.
The national side's manager was delighted with the performance of his
players last night and no-one could fault him for that. It was a solid
team performance built on the work of his defenders, who played
remarkably well and coped admirably when under pressure.
There were, of course, many last-second tackles, particularly from
Colin Hendry, but that doesn't matter at all because at least the
tackles were made. The Blackburn Rovers' central defender with Alan
McLaren and Colin Calderwood, who was making his international debut at
the age of 30, gave the Scottish fans, who numbered several hundred,
something to shout about.
They had travelled with not a great deal of hope but left the stadium
to enjoy another night of Muscovite hospitality buoyed by fresh
optimism. As is their wont, they are already making plans for a summer
holiday in England next year.
The Russians, especially their manager, Oleg Romantsev, will be
disappointed that they did not rise to the occasion, but it would be
churlish to dwell too long on their almost collective loss of form
because that would deny Scotland the credit they thoroughly deserve.
After all, few had given them much of a chance of taking a point in
Moscow but that is precisely what they did.
Just as had happened the previous evening when the Scottish Under-21
side scored a marvellous 2-1 win over their Russian counterparts, at
times the Scots made it difficult to tell which side was the home one.
The full-backs, Stewart McKimmie and Tommy Boyd, followed instructions
and pushed forward into the midfield -- and further forward than that in
Boyd's case -- in support of attacks and the Russians seemed bereft of
ways in which to subdue the players in blue shirts.
Boyd, in fact, had the first two chances created by Scotland, the
first manufactured by John McGinlay and the second by McKimmie, but
Russia's 'keeper Dmitri Kharin saved.
In midfield the captain, Gary McAllister, worked like a demon closing
down, urging, and exhorting the Scots around him to greater effort, and
John Collins and Paul McStay responded, although it would have been more
pleasing to have witnessed more creative Scottish endeavour.
Still, mustn't grumble, because a point in Moscow is a marvellous
achievement by a workmanlike squad which deserves another opportunity
even if competition for places will be more competitive next time
around. Although McGinlay and his front-line partner, Darren Jackson,
might lack a little in subtlety and touch they did not spare themselves
and made it difficult for the Russians to play the ball smoothly out of
defence.
Although there were occasions when the Russians thumped the ball
across the face of Scotland's goal causing blood pressure in the
Scottish dug-out to rise dramatically, there were few clear-cut
opportunities, and the best save of the evening was executed by Jim
Leighton midway through the first half. The Hibernian 'keeper responded
to a Yuri Nikiforov free-kick struck fiercely from 25 yards by leaping
to his right and holding the ball while still in flight.
The veteran saved the Scots again after 59 minutes when a point-blank
shot from Yuri Kovtun was deflected for a corner off a heel of the
keeper's boot.
Even then the feeling that the Scots could do themselves a powerful
amount of good in the Luzhniki Stadium began to grow stronger although
fortune did smile on the Scots after 32 minutes when Boyd pulled down
Valeri Karpin inside the box but the referee waved play on when a
penalty looked the likely outcome.
It became even more evident that the game was not going Russia's way
when they removed Igor Shalimov, whose place was taken by Vladislav
Radimov, and Dmitri Radchenko, who had scored the equaliser in the 1-1
draw at Hampden last year. His place was taken by Nikolai Pisarev. The
Scots changes were Duncan Shearer for Jackson and Billy McKinlay, who
took over from McGinlay.
Two Russians, Sergei Kiriakov and Igor Dobrovolski, were cautioned by
the German referee, Harmut Strampe, who also put McGinlay's name in his
book.

Mathew Spicer discovers a university department which has turned to
industry for the bulk of its funding, and the excellent reputation it
now enjoys
FUNDING is not a problem where you have excellence, maintains Tim
Miller, Lucas Professor of Electronics and Electrical Engineering at
Glasgow University, with the confidence of a man who has both in
enviable quantity. ''This department has research excellence in a number
of spheres -- world class, international level -- and I don't think
you'll find anyone whining about lack of funds.''
Miller's ambition is to run a University Research and Development
laboratory fully responsive to industry and funded directly by industry,
with next to no Government support. He is already more than halfway
there, thanks to the success and reputation of his SPEED Consortium
(Scottish Power Electronics and Electric Drives), an international group
of companies supporting a wide range of research and development (R &amp; D)
projects in the Power Electronics Laboratory.
Professor Miller, a Glasgow graduate with considerable industrial
experience, set up SPEED when he returned to the University in 1986
after working in the United States with General Electric. He brought
with him a clutch of American contacts, some of whom signed up to become
SPEED's first members when they heard of its formation.
American industry is familiar and comfortable with this kind of
association and 70% of SPEED's business is still with American
companies. Japan takes up a further 15%, with the remaining 15% divided
between Europe and the UK.
Membership of the consortium costs an annual subscription of #5000,
with new members paying an initial fee of #10,000 in order to safeguard
the investment of existing members who have -- after all -- funded the
current level of knowledge and expertise. And once in SPEED, companies
tend to stay.
The core service provided by SPEED to its member companies is
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for a spectrum of electric motors,
from those used in washing machines to the generation of aircraft power.
This software is in daily use and each day brings faxes and phone calls
to the laboratory asking for clarification or assistance.
When that assistance means practical work on design, it represents
SPEED's second service to its customers -- consultancy or, as Tim Miller
prefers to call it, fire-fighting. Consultancy is free to members and,
to protect the intellectual property and commercial confidentiality of
subscribers, no consultancy work is undertaken outwith the consortium.
The third and major area of the laboratory's work, for which the
companies do pay, is the design and construction of prototype hardware
under contract -- motors, electronic controllers, test equipment and
development kits. Basically a tin box that design engineers can plug
their equipment into, the kit speeds up the development time of new
products and has sold widely in the United States and Japan in
particular.
This design work is not undertaken for profit but to keep the
laboratory's electronic engineers, some of the best in the world, at the
cutting edge of development. Each new kit is more advanced that the
last, using the latest micro-electronic technology.
SPEED's turnover, at about #200,000 a year, is not huge. Tim Miller
regards the quality of the output and the number of talented people
employed -- currently about 15 and most of them local -- as the real
profit, the true measure of the style and significance of the operation.
In any scientific frontier territory, where intellectual property and
commercial confidence are involved, a relationship of absolute trust is
vital and SPEED has worked hard to be immediately responsive to its
customers' needs and scrupulously responsible with its customers'
secrets. As most businessmen will understand, that trust took longer to
develop with the Japanese than with the Americans, but develop it did.
Personal contact is vital. A group or individual from one or other
consortium company is in the laboratory most weeks; someone from the
laboratory -- usually Professor Miller -- will visit each company at
least once a year.
Last year, the laboratory logged 55 technical enquiries, ranging from
simple problems that could be solved in a morning to major design
crises. Just one of these, a recent request for help from the Danish
engineers DANFOSS, illustrates the service SPEED can provide for
manufacturing industry.
DANFOSS had a problem calculating inductance in a new motor for a
refrigerator designed for caravans -- a calculation vital to its
cost-effectiveness. In Glasgow, the problem was solved, the inductance
calculated and the design improved. A design task of six weeks was
completed in just one, utilising the resources of the SPEED team.
Professor Miller does not claim that his engineers are necessarily
better than those employed by SPEED's member companies, but they do
offer a very special and complimentary service. ''It's the skill of
solving new problems that's our speciality.''
Few British firms avail themselves of this service, partly because
they are unfamiliar with the concept of the consortium and partly
because they want to be assured of commercial results before investing.
Perhaps more fundamentally, the British manufacturing base has so
declined that this level of research and development is decidedly
scarce. LUCAS, who sponsor Miller's professorship, are a notable
exception.
Tim Miller thinks the Government misunderstands the function of
universities in relation to industry. ''It has a perception that the way
to get good co-operation between industry and universities is to take
the technology which is boiling up in the universities and transfer it
onto the factory floor. In many cases technological advancement is far
further ahead on the factory floor than it is back in the university.
Technology is somewhere other than where they think it is.
''Government needs to look afresh at what's going on in British
universities. When they do, for their next funding review, they will see
''a lot of enterprising activity that's not accounted for in their
bean-counting, brownie-points system,'' he said.

SCOTLAND'S supply of good quality office space is dwindling fast,
bringing new opportunities for speculative developers and creating the
prospects of rental increases after five years in the doldrums.
The increase in rentals will start slowly this year but should
accelerate from 1996 onwards, predicts a survey on Scotland's office
investment market by property consultants Ryden.
These findings are backed up by a report from surveyors Richard Ellis,
which says that the dwindling supply of quality space in Glasgow offers
an opportunity for developers.
The Ryden report says that Glasgow and Edinburgh rents have bottomed
out from their peaks around 1990-91 and there are good medium-term
prospects for rents bouncing back beyond their previous high points.
Such a recovery would put Edinburgh rentals back into the #25/#26 per sq
ft bracket, while Glasgow's would again reach their high-tide mark of
just over the #20 per sq ft achieved at the peak of the boom.
Ryden says that the rental increases will be driven by the limited
supply of Grade A buildings and an improving level of tenant demand.
''Average rental growth in Scotland over the past eight years has been
superior to that in the south, and these factors would suggest lower
yields would be appropriate north of the border,'' says the report.
During the recession office rentals fell further than those in retail
or industrial properties, so the potential for recovery is stronger.
Rental increases in London could make Scottish offices more attractive
to relocaters as the costs gap between London and Scotland widens.
The report concludes that if the Government manages to keep inflation
low, ''there are good prospects for office investments to register
significant real returns''.
These conclusions are reinforced by surveyors Richard Ellis. The
company maintain that Glasgow is now facing a shortage of quality office
space. The total amount of space available on the city's market fell by
26% last year, leaving some 1.5 million sq ft available. But with the
recent letting of the Grosvenor building on Gordon Street to Scottish
Amicable, less than 200,000 sq ft of this space could be considered as
Grade A. ''Availability of top-quality offices will continue to fall
sharply, while at the same time the healthy demand for this type of
space will put upward pressure on prime rents, which is encouraging news
for developers,'' says Craig Ritchie of Richard Ellis.
Approximately 132,500 sq ft of new space is under construction in the
city centre, not all of which will be completed during 1995. ''The new
supply is unlikely to meet expected demand, which would suggest overall
stronger competition and possible signs of rental growth towards the end
of the year,'' says Craig Ritchie.
Prime rents in Glasgow stand at around #17 per sq ft, although the
paucity of recent deals means that this level is difficult to prove in
the market.

TWO outmoded industrial and retail estates in the west of Scotland are
being given a new lease of life as modern retail parks, writes STEWART
McINTNOSH.
As a result, Uddingston's rejuvenated Birkenshaw Industrial Estate has
been sold to Boots Properties plc in a #2.2m deal.
The vendor was building firm Taylor Woodrow and the #2,223,000 sale
completes a remarkable turn around for the 2.5 acre site which has been
transformed from industrial warehousing into a 21,000 sq ft retail
location.
Two successful planning appeals to the Secretary of State for Scotland
allowed change of use from industrial, paving the way for the
construction of new retail units and the eventual sale of the
development.
David Tough, planning associate in Ryden's Edinburgh office who
conducted one of the appeals, said: ''The planning appeals and the
construction of new retail units have revitalised the estate and helped
to secure a very good sale for Taylor Woodrow. Birkenshaw has been
transformed from an industrial estate into a flourishing new retail
location.''
Sterling Warehouses now occupies a 13,500 sq ft unit at an annual rent
of #114,623 and FADS is the tenants of a 7500 sq ft unit at an annual
rent of #63,750.
Boots' purchase of the 21,000 sq ft development equates to a net
initial yield of 7.75%. Boots was represented by Hartley Cowley &amp; Co.
Meanwhile, Sydney &amp; London Properties Limited has been granted
planning consent for re-development of a 15-acre trading estate
developed in the 1960s adjacent to Glasgow airport.
The scheme includes what is thought to be the first ''out of town''
DIY retail store in Scotland. The consent permits redevelopment to
provide 140,000 sq ft gross retail floor space, restricted to the sale
of DIY, furniture, carpets, electrical and gardening goods.
''This is a well-recognised and well-frequented estate but is tired
and in need of re-development to provide suitable facilities for the
residents of Paisley,'' says Richard Anning of Sydney &amp; London.

TODAY'S Scottish Chambers of Commerce transport conference in the SECC
in Glasgow, to be attended by several hundred delegates, has the slogan
Getting Scotland Moving.
They represent a combined Scottish Chambers' membership of 8500 from
sole proprietor companies to multi-nationals, covering almost every
aspect of business and industry, a strong unaffiliated and firmly
non-political voice for the business community.
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, the host, has a membership of more than
2100 businesses and was founded in 1783. It is the oldest in the English
speaking world and began at a time when businessmen in what the small
town of Glasgow needed an independent gathering point.
British Affiliated Chambers represent more than 212,000 businesses in
a cross section of the business community throughout the United Kingdom,
Scotland has five core Chambers -- Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee
and Tayside, and Central Scotland. Associated local chambers can be in
the smallest of towns and some have as few as 10 members.
But all continue in the purpose for which the Glasgow Chamber was
established more than two centuries ago -- that independent gathering
point not related to the provision of public services, a private sector
organisation funded by its members.

AIR TRANSPORT
AIR transport means two things for industry: business travel and air
freight, and sometimes all that separates them is the cabin floor.
For beneath the polished shoes of businessmen flying to contract
negotiations in Frankfurt or New York are tonnes of ''belly-holed''
freight.
At other times dedicated freighters, some in familiar airline
liveries, others with names such as Polar Air and Cargolux, take
entirely different routes.
For business travel, Scottish companies have to add management time
and money to their budgets, perhaps as much as #50,000 a year according
to one director.
A weekly flight to London would add more than #200 per executive for
air fares. Late or early meetings, or inconvenient connecting flights,
could add a similar amount for hotel bills. The cost of management time
would double the total bill.
Air freight is even more important to the Scottish economy. Measured
by weight, only 1% of incoming raw materials and outgoing products
travel by air. Yet measured by value, that percentage rises to 48% for
incoming materials and 38% for outgoing goods.
More than #3m worth of components for Scotland's electronics industry
are flown in and more than #2m worth of finished products are flown out
every year.
Yet one-third of the raw materials arriving by air comes through
English airports. More than half of the finished electronics products
being flown out will do so by English airports.
In fact more than half of Scotland's total air cargo travels by road
overnight to Manchester and London airports as airlines balance out
loads between their different services. They then either fly them direct
to the destination airport or into a freight hub for transfer to another
flight.
Scotland's airports have increased their competitiveness and
flexibility. The proportion of air cargo from the electronics sector
exported direct from a Scottish airport last year was nearly half,
compared to nearly a quarter in the previous year. The proportion of raw
materials flown in direct was nearly two- thirds.
By the end of last year's third quarter, Glasgow Airport was handling
21,646 tonnes of cargo across all sectors, up 29.7% on the previous
year; Prestwick annual cargo traffic was above 12,000 tonnes, showing a
50% increase on the previous year; and Edinburgh was handling 2853
tonnes, an increase of 254.4% mainly due to DHL setting up operations
there.
Royal Mail handled another 27,000 tonnes at Edinburgh and 5000 tonnes
at Glasgow. Scottish Airports BAA subsidiary, is spending more than #6m
on improved cargo facilities at the two airports.
Sophisticated cargo handling allied to simpler EU customs procedures
can reduce the amount of time cargo sits on the ground, and Scotland's
airports have advantages over English airports.
Imports and exports clearance on goods flown via London can be
completed in Scotland, saving days in some cases. Scottish Airports'
target is to have 95% of air cargo cleared in four hours.
Despite the trend towards deregulation, international air transport
remains bound by a web of bilateral agreements whose clauses have more
to do with trade-offs than an integrated policy.
These agreements grant the two countries a number of ''freedoms'' at
each other's airports, such as the right to pick up and carry passengers
and cargo between those countries. Restrictions on the ''fifth
freedom'', the right to carry them on to a third country, is hampering
the movement of air freight through Scotland.
Cargolux was last year granted a temporary fifth freedom to fly from
Houston and pick up cargo at Prestwick for delivery to Luxembourg, and
from Luxembourg to take cargo from Prestwick to Seattle.
According to the position paper prepared by Dr Alan McKinnon of
Heriot-Watt Business School for today's conference, ''the denial of
'fifth freedom rights' to air freight operators wishing to pick up and
drop off consignments at UK airports on route between other countries .
. . is undoubtedly constraining the growth of air freight traffic at
Prestwick.''
John Henderson, chief executive of SPEED, the Scottish Partnership for
Effective and Economic Distribution, believes air cargo is being used as
''a political pawn'' in bilateral talks with the US.

IT is revealing of both Scotland's transport infrastructure and of
Scottish Airports' business that Vernon Murphy's worries are at ground
level.
Glasgow Airport, with more than three million passengers, last year
achieved a bigger increase in numbers than either Heathrow or Gatwick.
Murphy's main concerns are the congestion of the M8 linking Glasgow
Airport to its customer and lack of a complete motorway link between the
country's two biggest cities.
''I can't think of anywhere in the UK that wouldn't get two cities
like Edinburgh and Glasgow linked by motorway,'' he said. ''The M8 is
the problem in Glasgow -- that and the need to complete the motorway
box.
''The one real way of getting through Glasgow is increasingly
congested. It is not the actual journey time: what people are not
prepared to put up with is not knowing whether they will be sitting on
the Kingston Bridge seeing the flight take off.''
He is confident that where enough demand for an air service exists, it
will be provided. ''The airlines have shown that if they need to pick up
at both airports to get the right passenger mix, they will do so.''
Scottish Airports, as the owner of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen
airports, can set landing charges so that it is worth the airlines'
while picking up at two airports.
''We have structured our charges so that they don't pay any more and
they are prepared to do double pick-ups.''
Air France on the Paris service, Sabena on the Brussels route and
British Midland to Copenhagen call at Glasgow and Edinburgh. Air UK
called at Aberdeen and Edinburgh with its Amsterdam service. ''It is
based on what the customer wants,'' said Murphy. ''United Airlines tried
an executive coach service from Edinburgh to Glasgow. ''You could check
in at Edinburgh and have a guaranteed seat from Glasgow. It just didn't
work and it didn't attract people.''
Last year's loss of direct transatlantic services by United Airlines
and Northwest produced a wailing and gnashing of teeth from the business
community but no sign of a preparedness to pay business-class prices.
The presence of United probably owed much to Scottish Airports'
marketing and goodwill to Scotland within the airline. Its departure
owed everything to the need to maximise the return on the expensive
capital investment that is a plane by moving it to faster-growing
Pacific routes.
Next week American Airlines returns to the route after a winter
sabbatical and British Airways has since January been operating an
enhanced service from Glasgow to New York with a second leg on to
Boston.
''The whole thing centres on business traffic,'' he said. ''The
difference between scheduled and charter services is business travel.
The leisure traveller is less concerned for the flexibility of tickets.
''Between 1992 and 1994 business traffic in Scotland declined.''
This was after the worst of the recession. ''On international services
in Scotland business traffic had declined by more than 10%, that was
quite dramatic.
''For eight years BA put on a direct service to Paris at 7am with a
flight back in the evening. If BA, with their travel agent loyalty and
Air Miles, cannot make that pay after eight years, who can?
The reason may have more to do with the structure of Scottish business
rather than the air industry. ''You do not have the corporate or head
offices in Scotland. You often find offices away from the centre have
more tightly controlled costs.''
Scottish Airports has told the Government that it supports Prestwick
in its arguments over fifth freedom. ''It is a point worth arguing,''
says Murphy.
Elsewhere he believes there is scope for new carriers to emerge.
''Over the next couple of years, if the economy improves, you could find
new low-cost carriers gaining the confidence to start new services.''
The leisure traveller is proving more predictable. While the overall
number of transatlantic scheduled services may be down this year, there
will for example be 12 flights a week to Orlando.
Murphy added: ''We have to decide where we are going in terms of
attracting airlines. There is no point in attracting airlines which
businessmen won't support.''

What has Ireland done to increase its tourist trade over the past 10
years?
TOURISM is not only an industry, it should be our most successful, but
restrictions on air services are hindering it, according to Mathew
Hudson, chairman of Prestwick Airport's operators, PIK Limited.
''The tourist industry is extremely diverse,'' he said. ''It consists
of a large number of businesses throughout Scotland, most independently
owned and operated. It is the quintessential 'cottage' industry.
''This cottage industry is national with all that word implies.
Whether we are selling 'short breaks' of two to four days, a week, or a
fortnight we are in competition with many other national tourist
industries.''
By far the largest market for tourism is the export market: visitors
from abroad, and the best form of transport for most of them is air.
''Our National Business Plan is fatally flawed because we do not have
an appropriate delivery mechanism which connects us to the international
gateway, London,'' said Hudson, who will be chairing the air session in
today's conference.
''We do not have a direct air delivery system capable of accessing our
prime markets at a cost which allows us to compete effectively with
other national products. We do not have a Scottish aviation policy.
''Most, if not all value added industries in Scotland, are thus
needlessly handicapped. This includes not only tourism but other sectors
such as electronics.''
As a diverse cottage industry, tourism should be able to rely on
government to fulfill its traditional role of organising and assisting
the means of production and the selling and delivery of the product,
argues Hudson.
''Instead our Government erects barriers against Scotland: not in the
form of tariff walls or anything quite so obvious but through the
erection of regulatory barriers against effective and cost-efficient air
transport systems.
''Even more insidious, none of our competitors, including the English,
suffer from such barriers.
Hudson compares the experience of Scotland and Ireland over the past
10 years, during which the number of international visitors to Scotland
has declined while those to Ireland has increased.
Ireland, from being a distant second, now leads. The two countries
have similar landscapes and cultural heritage, the same language,
climate, outdoor activities, and are a similar distance from the same
international gateway -- London.
In 1985 Ireland's air connections to London were provided by the
Government-owned carriers, British Airways and Aer Lingus.
''The route was a shared monopoly with fares to match,'' said Hudson.
The next year a small private Irish carrier, Ryanair, began to serve
the Ireland- London route with a fare of #99 return. The route grew to
900,000 passengers that year.
Eight years later, Ryanair had reduced its fare to #59 return, there
were five carriers and three million passengers on the route, and
Ireland had overtaken Scotland in tourism.
''Scotland still suffers the same financial remoteness from the
gateway,'' said Hudson. ''The cost of air fares between London and
Scotland still handcuffs the Scottish economy just as Ireland was
handicapped 10 years ago.
''There is nothing to choose between the Irish and Scottish tourism
product except for the delivery mechanism. Ten years ago the delivery
mechanisms were similar and Scotland outsold Ireland.
''Ireland improved its delivery mechanism and now outsells Scotland.''
Hudson uses the Scotland- Ireland services as another example, taking
passenger numbers in November 1993 as a base line. ''Scotland-Ireland
was served by Aer Lingus and BAA (Abbotsinch). The route was an
effective monopoly. Fares reflected the lack of competition.
''By November 1993 traffic had been in decline for several years.
Using passenger numbers then as a unit of measurement, we would have
anticipated a fall for Aer Lingus to 97% or less by November 1994.''
Then in May 1994 Ryanair began operating from Prestwick to Dublin.
''Return fares were from #55 as little as 25% off many of the Aer Lingus
fares.''
Six months into the new service, Aer Lingus had increased its own
traffic to 103% of the numbers the year before. ''On the other hand, the
new Prestwick service reached 154%.
''After only six months of operation the new low-cost air service had
increased traffic on the Scotlnad/Ireland route to 257% in what had been
a declining market.
''Scotland's tourist industry needs low air fares supported by
targeted route-by-route foreign marketing.''

A ''SMART'' computer system being pioneered at the Irvine mill of
Caledonian Paper offers potential savings of thousands of pounds worth
of lost production time.
The system known as case-based reasoning, or CBR, offers engineers the
chance to diagnose and repair faults faster than before and can also
predict possible problems in the manufacturing process.
CBR has been developed at Yale University over the last 10 years and
is now making the transition from the computer laboratory to the shop
floor.
Caledonian Paper, the UK's sole manufacturer of lighweight-coated
paper for magazine and brochure publishing, has installed one of the
first CBR systems in Scotland and it is already paying dividends.
Mr Jack Lord, engineering director at the Ayrshire plant, said: ''If
we lose a day's production it can cost the company in excess of #100,000
so it is essential that down time is kept to a minimum.
''In the past, a problem may have occurred that one engineer knew
about but he was not around and a colleague may not have been so
familiar with that problem. That led to potentially costly delays in
diagnosing and repairing faults.
''Now the information is fed into the computer and stores it in a
library of thousands of other cases. Just as humans tend to solve
problems by drawing on past experiences, CBR works by adapting solutions
that were used to solve old problems.
''The user presents the new problem to the computer and it will come
up with the closest similar cases and, coupled with the knowledge of the
engineer, can adapt it to the current circumstances.''
Jack Lord is pleased with the new dimension offered by this form of
artificial intelligence but dismisses concerns that systems like it will
eventually replace humans.
''I believe that it enhances, rather than supplants, knowledge. It is
a support, not a substitute, for human experience and I cannot see it
displacing individuals.''
Caledonian Paper, part of the Kymmene Group of Finland, started
production in April 1989 and at the time was Scotland's largest inward
investment at #220m.
There are now 430 people employed at the plant and local management
are hopeful that a second production line can be added on ground already
prepared for the purpose with the creation of over 200 jobs.
Last week the company handed over its millionth tonne of paper several
months ahead of schedule.
At current production levels the Irvine site produces around 600
tonnes of paper a day, turns over #100m a year with an expected profit
this year for the first time, and exports to the rest of Europe, the USA
and Asia.
The key raw material in the paper-making process is Scottish sitka
spruce. Every year over 200,000 tonnes of timber logs from Scotland's
forests are used with two trees planted for every one cut down to
provide a renewable and sustainable supply of wood.

SCOTLAND has been the focus of considerable activity in the
supermarket retailing sector in recent months with Tesco's purchase of
Dundee-based William Low's and Kwiksave's buy-out of the troubled
Shoprite group.
The trend toward a concentration of sales among the big four
supermarket chains -- Sainsbury, Safeway, Tesco and Asda -- has been
continuing apace for the last couple of decades, although the rate has
slowed considerably since the late seventies and early eighties.
Now, however, there are signs that the independent shopkeeper is
fighting back. The market share of the independent retailer has fallen
from 27% in 1981 to around 12% by 1992 with the multiples increasing
their share from 54% to 75% over the same period. Total turnover during
this period has risen from #1725m in 1981 to #4309m in 1992.
Consumers currently buy around 85% of their goods from supermarkets
but the corner shop is keeping hold of their customers by improving the
professionalism of their service and by combining their efforts. In
Paisley recently a group of independent retailers combined to reduce
prices and advertise their services to compete with a new supermarket
development at nearby Braehead.
Another development has arisen with the Shopwise retail group,
representing around 40 shopkeepers, which was started last year to help
with finance, refurbishment improvements, and increased discounts, from
wholesalers for the independent retailer.
Mr Lawrie Dewar, chief executive of the Scottish Grocers Federation,
believes that the local independent retailer has a future but only by
adopting a more professional approach: ''We now have a situation where
an ever increasing square footage of retail space is competing for the
same level of expenditure. Food inflation is negligible so more and more
space is competing for the same amount of money. This has made our
450-500 members adopt a more professional approach. We encourage them to
invest in their stores, in products and in refurbishment.''
The supermarkets are no longer just competing on price but are
increasingly selling the ideas of service and quality.
Equally there has been a growth in specialist quality independent
retailers who don't see price as the sole focus for competition.
The Q Guild was established in 1986 to promote the top 1% of
independent retail butchers. With just 30 members in Scotland, out of a
total of 140 throughout the UK, their message is that ''you can
certainly buy cheaper goods elsewhere but you are unlikely to be able to
buy better. Based on the Dutch model of the K butchers, Guild members
have their products and facilities regularly, and randomly, inspected by
the Meat and Livestock Commission to a higher specification than normal
retail butchers'', according to Q Guild spokesman Ross Muir.
The Q Guild believe that this is the way forward in competing with the
supermarkets as immediate past chairman and Dundonian butcher, David
Craig, explained: ''We offer a guarantee of standards. We believe that
isof concern to our customers and therefore must be of concern to the Q
butcher.''
But there are some who are more gloomy about the future. Alex Smith
owns the prestigious game dealer and butchers shop, George Bower and
Sons, in Edinburgh's Raeburn Place. His shop, within a few hundred yards
of an enormous Safeway supermarket, has a regular clientele but George
believes that even this will not be enough to keep his shop going when
his daughters take over following his retirement in five years time.
''There'll be no shops here in the future. Everybody has cars now and
the supermarkets cater for people with vehicles. At the same time that
the councils are agreeing to massive car parks beside new supermarkets
they are restricting the parking facilities for customers outside local
shops. They are also increasing the level of rates which will force most
of the small shops out of business,'' he said.
These views are echoed by Lawrie Dewar: ''Local authorities have to
play their part and give as much support to the local independent
retailer as they do to the supermarket chains. Instead of putting yellow
lines outside the doors of shops they should be helping develop
neighbourhood shopping.''

THE term ''airport of community interest'' does not convey much.
However, in the context of the European Union it has a specific, and
potentially beneficial connotation, particularly from a Scottish
viewpoint when it applies to Glasgow Airport.
It means that such an airport is recognised as being of strategic
importance and becomes eligible for injections of EU cash for a new
runway or improvements to its access infrastructure.
Airports of community interest are akin to a European Super League,
recognised officially by the EU as being of much greater significance
than those which are merely of regional or local importance. Thus the
designation of Glasgow as an ACI at the last European Summit in Corfu is
good news for the airport.
It is, however, better news for the bodies who make up the Glasgow
Airport Initiative and who are cautiously optimistic about the spin-off
benefits the airport's eminence should generate.
''The real significance of this positive decision by the European
ministers may have escaped the notice of many,'' said Mike Sandys,
director of the Glasgow Airport Inititative.
''But it really is important. Glasgow now joins London and Manchester
in the UK in being recognised as a key engine of economic growth.''
Sandys is confident that the EU's good intentions will translate into
hard cash and believes that ACI status for the airport will have a
positive effect on the initiative's ability to help deliver its forecast
12,000 jobs for Renfrewshire, plus 4000 across central Scotland.
And while the continuing growth of the airport is of importance in
achieving economic expansion, there are fears that this will be
constrained if the passengers and freight carriers cannot reach it
easily because of poor road and rail links.
''The success of the Airport Initiative hinges on the expansion of the
airport,'' said Mike Sandys.
''In turn that cannot be maximised without improved infrastructure. We
have to encourage everyone to get behind the new motorway and rail
links.''
The links to which he refers are the northern extension to the M74,
the building of the crossrail link over the Clyde in Glasgow and the
construction of a rail link to the airport.
The figures involved are substantial -- #250m for the M74, #77m for
crossrail and #28.5m for the airport spur. But these, believes Sandys,
are costs which must be faced. ''The European Union has confidence in
the potential of the airport as the engine of growth -- but engines need
serviced. We mustn't let this one seize up.''
This is a view echoed by the man at the helm of transport at
Strathclyde Region, Councillor Charles Gordon, Chair of the Roads and
Transportation Committee.
''The most topical issue is the planning application for the northern
extension of the M74 which is with Glasgow District Council,'' he
declares. ''Everyone who is involved in this scheme should make sure
they play a full part in the planning process.''
Strathclyde is behind plans to create a rail link to Glasgow Airport
-- to the extent that provision for half of the estimated cost is still
in the capital budget, with the remainder to be sought from a variety of
other funding partners.
Councillor Gordon, however, concedes that the project is very much
dependent upon the building of crossrail, to bridge the gap between the
north and south of the city ''our number one commitment'' to enable rail
travellers from all over Scotland to reach the airport without having to
change trains.
He concludes: ''If Glasgow Airport is to optimise its potential as one
of the key parts of the West of Scotland economy, it would benefit
enormously from the rail link and the M74 extension.''
Vernon Murphy, managing director of Scottish Airports Ltd, has seen
the number of passengers using Glasgow rising steadily.
The year-on-year increase recorded in December was 8.8%, making
Glasgow a 5.5 million passenger airport.
Murphy, not surprisingly, is keen to ensure that these statistics
continue their upward momentum, despite the loss last year of some
transatlantic services ''a disappointment, but not a body blow'' he
maintains. More people are flying every year, the argument goes. And
this means that even if they cannot reach their final destination
non-stop from Glasgow they will still use the airport to begin their
journey.
Murphy's principal concern is that growth should not be constrained.
That means he is firmly behind the M74 extension.
''I believe it is important,'' he states, ''our access infrastructure
must be improved.''
He sees the M8, with its attendant delays in and out of Glasgow as the
airport's Achilles heel, a state of affairs he emphasises by pointing
from the window to the crawling lines of traffic on the nearby elevated
section.
''A lot of the problem is unreliability rather than mere journey
times,'' he asserts. ''It is impossible to predict how long it will take
to get to and from here. All it needs is a breakdown or a little shunt
and the traffic is backed up for miles.''
On the need for the rail link he is, he claims, willing to be
convinced.
''If a viable option comes up we will support it in terms of financial
contributions and promotion, but I would have to say I am a little
concerned about viability.''
Like others, he awaits the results of feasibility studies being
carried out by Strathclyde Region. ''We have to remember that it is not
just the construction costs which have to be taken into account, but
also the operating costs,'' he adds. ''We have to know who will pick up
the bill.''

SHIPS and the sea are once again consolidating their position at the
centre of the West of Scotland's transport infrastructure.
''Port facilities along the estuary are enjoying a rebirth,'' claimed
John Mather, executive chairman of Clydeport Operations Ltd. ''We are
consolidating our position as a major gateway for the export and import
of a variety of products and commodities.''
One of the main reasons he sees for the return of steady growth across
Clydeport's market sector is the sheer economic attraction of shipping
as transportation.
''In an increasingly competitive environment we are working to provide
a flexible service, responsive to the changing needs of the market. We
are constantly innovating and investing the best equipment.''
Examples of the way in which the tide is turning for the Clyde are
many. Purchased from British Steel in October 1993, the Hunterston Coal
Terminal in Ayrshire is spearheading what is happening. Since the
purchase it has handled over one million tonnes of coal from all over
the world, creating 50 new jobs and employing more than 100 people in
the local community.
Always recognised as one of Europe's finest deep water facilities, the
Hunterston Terminal has outstripped all performance targets. Coal is
trans-shipped to markets including France, Spain and Scandinavia. Coal
imported from Colombia, Australia and Europe is destined for Kilroot
Power Station in Ireland.
Now contributing more than #100,000 a week to the Ayrshire economy,
the Clydeport plan to make Hunterston the fastest and most
cost-effective operation of its kind in Europe is regarded as being well
on the way to being realised.
John Mather is equally proud of the way in which Greenock Ocean
Terminal is enjoying matching success. Among significant container
traffic increases to Europe, new weekly services to Bilbao meet the
current growing overseas demand for whisky.
''The Ocean Terminal is now handling Canadian wood pulp and at the
same time we are making significant inroads into the cruise ship
market.''
The latter included the QE2 sailing into Greenock as part of her
Silver Jubilee cruise round Britain -- a proud moment in Clydeport
history.
Illustrating current trends, docks and quays along the estuary have
seen a brisk range of traffic operations during the past few weeks. The
list, which includes Greenock and Rothesay Dock, Stobcross Quay and
Meadowside, King George V Dock, Shieldhall and Riverside Quay have
handled cargoes which have encompassed scrap metal, minerals, grain,
whisky, container traffic, and a range of heavy plant for export to
Spain and France.
Important factors in the Clyde's continuing good fortune are regarded
as including on-going investment and the recent upgrading of transport
links. The latter include recent M8 upgrading which has brought benefits
to Greenock Ocean Terminal in terms of transportation to either the
centre of Glasgow or Glasgow Airport.
''A well-equipped and efficient port, one which enjoys excellent road,
rail and air links as Clydeport does, can play a major role in the
future of Scotland's transport sector,'' said John Mather. ''In an
increasingly competitive environment we are working to provide a
flexible service which can be responsive to the changing needs of the
market.''
He considers another major asset in the task is the strength of
Clydeport's management team.
''We are confident that we will be able to further develop our
operations to take advantage of strategic opportunities. As the months
and years pass, the Clyde will continue to re-establish its place at the
hub of Scotland's transport infrastructure.''

Is there a lesson to be learned from Forth Ports' enterprising
approach?
RESPONDING to business opportunity should be a reflex action, says
Forth Ports plc. Their own brisk response to changing circumstances also
reflects their geographical position as they service the needs of
Scottish industry.
Recognising altered freight patterns, coming side by side with
increasing customer demands for improved efficiency in sea transport
communication, they have maintained a drive to provide better support
services. Faster vessel turn-round times, quality of services and
integrated port facilities aimed at reducing clients' distribution costs
are among the claimed benefits.
''The prospects for our business are most encouraging with steady
growth in the ports sector,'' said Mr Hugh Thompson their chief
executive. ''New opportunities are being progressed at Rosyth and on the
River Mersey and Birkenhead. Our property company has also made a major
contribution to our affairs and this is an ongoing situation with profit
and income generated from current and planned development over the next
few years.''
Current illustrations include Grangemouth, where daily containership
sailings, sea boxes shipped out to the major ports of Europe and
southern England to be trans-shipped on to world-wide destinations. At
Leith, continental car manufacturers complement bringing up their new
models from southern ports by road transporter by additional sea
deliveries to the quayside -- numbers can amount to 1600 vehicles aboard
one vessel.
Since privatisation, Forth Ports plc claims to have consolidated its
position as ''Scotland's most important port complex''. Profitability is
being matched by a sustained programme of investment and growth
ambitions are not restricted by the limits of the Firth of Forth. An
agreement has been reached with Twelve Quays Ltd at Birkenhead which
will see them involved in the development of a terminal on the Mersey,
handling Ro-Ro and passenger traffic in the Irish Sea.
Forth Ports management has in general carried out a sustained drive to
offer shippers a fast and most comprehensive service with improved flows
of consignments, information, and reliability on delivery times.
Grangemouth, the estuary's principal port for the movement of
commodities, has seen the establishment of new container services and a
rise in the number of shippers using them for the first time with a
resultant increase in throughput tonnage.
Principal ports linked to Grangemouth by liner service include
Rotterdam, Antwerp, Thamesport and Southampton. Sailings have also been
made to test the market for deliveries of finished products from
Grangemouth to Russia. Bridge Baltic and their agents Fred Olsen have
direct sailings both to St Petersburg and the less congested Finnish
port of Kotka. Both sailings are believed to have potential growth.
Grangemouth is also benefiting from increased tonnages of forest
products, a result in the upswing in activity of construction related
industry.
New business cargoes through the port will also result from the
completion of a hi-tech fishmeal factory to be constructed at a cost of
several million pounds by Biomar, jointly owned by a Danish company and
by Norsk Hydro. Grangemouth was chosen because of its mix of available
land, services and motorway links.
At Leith, serving the offshore oil and gas centre, fluctuations
between high and low activity which are part of these industries are
taken for granted but Forth Ports has made a point of broadening its
commercial base and attracting new business.
In addition to pipe imports and materials for treatment, staple bulk
cargoes now include forest products, grain, fertiliser and coal. Raw
materials come in from Africa and the West Indies.
At Dunbar, Blue Circle operators of the town's major cement works have
established a new export terminal with a 1200-tonne silo capacity for
cement exports to the Norwegian market.
Burntisland and Methil have also had their share of new investment,
underpinning the prosperity of their local community. Hound Point, sited
on the estuary and Braefoot Bay, on the Fife shore, are important to the
oil, gas and petrochemical operations of BP and Shell-Exxon. Underlining
that Forth Ports have just commissioned the tug Fidra built on the
Mersey at a cost of #3.5m, under the terms of a new 10-year agreement
with Shell the Marine terminal operators.

SCOTLAND'S transport infrastructure has an unfinished look. Its two
main cities are not linked by a complete motorway and there is only one
full dual carriageway link to England and the enormous continental
market which lies beyond. There is no full dual carriageway road to the
North of Scotland.
Roads carry around 150 million tonnes of goods uplifted in Scotland
every year. About 80% of industry's raw materials enter Scotland by road
and 58% of finished products leave - 85% for the electonics sector.
Though rail freight had fallen from 12 million to seven million tonnes
of freight in the seven years to 1992, it still accounts for an
estimated 11% of incoming raw materials though only 2% of outgoing
goods.
This should increase with Channel Tunnel services but it will in turn
increase demand for upgrading the West Coast Main Line rail link south,
which has hardly changed for 20 years. Loss of passengers to air and
road is already bringing pressure for upgrading.
RailTrack and the Government are committed to upgrading but not to the
estimated #2000m cost. New rolling stock would cost extra.
Tunnels and bridges are already being enlarged to take Eurostar
passenger trains and ''swop body'' freight trains which will use the
Channel Tunnel. Further enlargement to allow for ''piggy-back trains''
carrying whole lorry trailers, could attract more business but would
need further investment.
Coastal shipping carries around 30 million tonnes but about 100,000
tonnes pass through Scottish ports. Of goods specifically for industry,
8% of raw materials but 39% of finished products go by sea. Measured by
value, those percentages fall to 5% and 19%, although they are higher
for electronics.
Air, ideal for high-value goods, brings in around 45% of raw
materials, taking out 24% of electronics goods and 38% of other finished
products.
To make the most of investment in transport, the infrastructure must
be as flexible as possible. Transport connections are only as reliable
as their least reliable part.

Scotland's hauliers appear to be getting a raw deal when compared with
their European counterparts
TWO of the men who represent the interests of many of the army of road
transport operators who earn their living on Scotland's roads share a
common hope when it comes to considering the future.
Wylie Cunningham, the Road Haulage Association's director for Scotland
and Paul Guzzan, outgoing Scottish chairman of the Freight Transport
Association, both declare the need for Scotland to be afforded a ''level
playing field'' for road transport.
''It is not just in terms of going into Europe,'' said Wylie
Cunningham. ''Even in England we can be more than 400 miles from local
competition. We believe that in fairness Scotland should be sensibly
favoured in terms of Government policy.''
His 1000 members -- they operate several thousand vehicles between
them -- make up much of the higher and reward professional haulage side
of the industry. ''Today we have to consider situations like 'cabotage'
which can allow some foreign hauliers to deliver goods in this country
then perform certain domestic operations within the United Kingdom
before returning across the channel.
''When we cross the channel we have to face a situation where hauliers
in some countries are recompensed for the need to pay motorway tolls by
being awarded much reduced excise duties. The UK industry is the highest
duty rated in Europe. Where a UK operator is taxed at up to #3000 for a
38-tonne vehicle, the same vehicle would cost a French operator only
#150. We also have to absorb high fuel duties.
Distances between destinations in Scotland, he feels, should also be
featured in any final conference document and he points to the way in
which Scotland, with roughly one-third of the UK land mass, also has 10%
of the UK population.
''If anything, our proposed level playing field should be tilted
towards Scotland.''
He is a firm believer in the view that roads have to be accepted as a
vital part of industrial regeneration. He feels that road transport, as
a service industry, has to be given careful and rational consideration
of the need for future planning and infrastructure requirements.
Another of the issues currently confronting hauliers is the effect of
new vehicle emission regulations now in place. There, he feels, a
balance has to be struck between the interests of the environment and
the most recent of technical advances.
''I will be keenly interested in what I hear at today's SECC
conference,'' said Wylie Cunningham. ''Its conclusions and
recommendations to Government will be important to all Scottish
hauliers.''
Paul Guzzan takes the same viewpoint in his role as Scottish Chairman
of the Freight Transport Association's Scottish branch. With
headquarters in Stirling, it has some 1800 members who can be involved
in freight transport by road, rail, sea or air. Members also operate
regional and municipal council fleets.
''But in many instances the key issue has to be better roads,'' he
said. ''Roads are the backbone of it all. When I compare the amount of
motorway mileage in the South of England to our own situation, Scotland
is at an unfair disadvantage. We need a fairer share of motorways.''
Gaps in Scotland's road network are clearly identified by his
membership. They include the need for a major updating of roads between
Glasgow and Aberdeen along with improved access along the A96 in the
North of Scotland.
''Much work may have been done on the M74, but a lot more work needs
to be done on it and to be done much more quickly than in the past.''
Like their Road Haulage Association colleagues, his members also feel
strongly about existing regulations regarding overall lorry weight
limits.
''As things stand, the situation is ridiculous,'' he said. ''Europe
operates its freight vehicles up to a 40-tonne limit. Yet operators in
the United Kingdom are held down to a 38-tonne limit -- and things are
intended to stay that way until the beginning of 1999.
''To be even one tonne overweight brings a heavy fine. It is one more
factor which places Scottish operators at a severe cost disadvantage
when up against competing European operators.
''We will continue to press our case for an urgent reconsideration of
the whole position. We want to see a new 44-tonne limit applied in the
UK. Scottish operators are aware that any talk of heavier vehicles can
bring an immediate storm of protest from communities who live alongside
the main routes.''
His own hopes for the conference include that it will accept that,
come what may, the lorry will be recognised as a vital link in any
transport overview of the situation.
''It must be a conference which gives consideration and a hearing to
all -- not just views from people behind desks. We need more roads, we
need more infrastructure, we need more understanding of the need for
Scottish industry to be allowed to compete on that level playing field
in England as well as in Europe.''

With journey times to European cities getting shorter, ScotRail
believes its freight terminal at Mossend will play a key role in
Scotland's future prosperity
SCOTLAND'S conference on transport planning could hardly have been
timed better, say railway interests.
''One example is that we are due to be vested -- become a subsidiary
company in our own right -- in the near future,'' said Alex Lynch,
acting director of ScotRail. ''The railway input will be vital to this
conference and we are ready to work with all the other transport
organisations in the country towards success for Scotland.
''We know that people are still getting used to what happened as a
result of re-organisation under the 1993 Transport Act. Our customers
may not see radical changes, but the changes that are already happening
within are important and will matter to them and even more to our
customers of the future.''
ScotRail is impressive by any statistical standard. With a #300m
annual turnover, it operates some 600 trains a day and carries out
170,000 passenger journeys over its 1500 route miles. Add 332 stations
and 4200 staff and its importance is self-evident.
''When a traveller views ScotRail, I like to think that they see a
service which has become more dedicated to the customer,'' said Alex
Lynch. ''We are going through a complexity of change. Perhaps we need a
little more time to put ourselves totally in order, but at the moment we
are trying to deliver the best possible service to customers.''
That includes every one of the 4200 staff having gone through the
''Friendly ScotRail'' programme, a two-day course where the emphasis on
the fact that an important part of their job is to deliver an overall
package of service to the customer.
Rail is currently catering to some 8% of the travelling market in
Scotland. Although figures have already been improving, Alex Lynch
believes ScotRail should look to further improvement.
''Now we are free to concentrate on driving and maintaining the trains
which we lease from Railtrack, we are working hard on developing a
closer relationship between customers and staff.
''Our plans for future improvements of facilities and service are
prepared. We are certainly optimistic about the future and this
conference gives us an opportunity to clearly state our purpose and
remind people that we know there is a lot to be done.
''Some of it is being done already, reflecting the result of customer
research and special customer 'surgeries'. But like the other new
companies much of our hoped-for plans are tied to future funding
levels.''
A more immediate increase in business is expected to flow from the
Enterprise service of TransRail, which was formed in April last year as
Trainload Freight West, since when it has won more than 500,000 tonnes
of new freight, mainly in Scotland. It is expected to move into the
private sector next year.
It means companies moving as little as 25 tonnes of freight could find
rail an attractive alternative to road. The new flexibility offered by
TransRail could change the rail freight map.
At present little or no freight moves by rail north of Inverness, but
companies in Caithness and Sutherland are showing interest in the new
option.
The service could also link well with shipping, even over short
distances, and initial talks have been held with one major port over
restoring rail lines to the quayside.
Plans and hopes also predominate at Mossend, one of the other trump
cards in the railways bidding for its share of Scotland's transport
future.
It has been open for freight business since June last year and now has
a scheduled throughput of 127 wagons each weekday. Full name, the
Eurocentral Rail Freight Terminal, it is the Scottish terminal into the
pan-European rail network covering some 240,000 kilometres.
Its freightliner activity is being separated from Channel Tunnel
business and set up as a separate company under the Government's
privatisation programme.
''Mossend is part of a railfreight distribution network of five United
Kingdom hubs,'' said terminal manager Ken Duffy. ''The others are at
Willesden, Birmingham, Manchester and Port of Liverpool. All offer
direct access to the prime business markets of mainland Europe.
''The Government has said that Channel Tunnel railfreight services
will initially remain within the public sector. Once Railfreight
Distribution's new international freight business is firmly established
in the marketplace, decisions on future ownership can be taken on a
robust basis.''
Mossend's 16-acre Eurocentral terminal is regarded as ideally located
to provide rapid access to the key industrial areas of Scotland.
Established at a cost of #8.6m it has the capacity to handle up to
400,000 tonnes of freight per year and the Lanarkshire Development
Agency who constructed the terminal, also plans to develop a #45m
freight village over a 127-acre site beside it offering warehousing and
servicing facilities.
Ken Duffy regards transit times from Mossend as telling their own
story.
''Bordeaux is 38 hours away, Madrid 53, Basle 38, Manheim 46, and it
is 40 hours to Milan. Mossend has a capacity to handle up to 74,000
unitised loads a year.
''We are in fact Scotland's rail gateway to Europe.''
Forecasts for Mossend's future include the fact that it is part of an
800-acre greenfield site which has a potential to support some 8000 jobs
over the next 10-15 years.
''It would generate more than #250m of investment,'' said Ken Duffy.
His firm belief is that Mossend with its faster rail link to Europe
will be the catalyst for one of Scotland's most important industrial
developments in decades.

THE reasons for the failure to get a direct Scottish export train
running daily to Europe in time for the Channel Tunnel's opening are
revealed in an interim report from the Scottish Partnership for
Effective and Economic Distribution (SPEED), made available exclusively
to The Herald.
The idea of developing rail freight services direct from Scotland to
the Continent was first raised in January last year by the Surface
Distribution Group of SPEED. It realised almost immediately that the
timetabling of such services would not meet the schedules of the
electronics companies in the group.
They also accepted that although electronics firms are major
exporters, they were unlikely to fill a whole train every day. So they
decided to invite whisky exporters to join them in what became known as
SPEED's European Rail Freight Project.
The electronics companies needed a late evening departure from
Scotland and a noon arrival in Paris. The whisky firms needed prices
comparable to what they were already paying.
Having decided that a full daily export train to Paris was viable, the
group asked for timings and costs from rail operators. In July five
operators presented their proposals to the group, although only one
wanted to put a price on its service. The best time offered was 18 hours
with a later departure not available until mid-1995.
Three operators were chosen to receive more details of freight
shipments from the main companies in the group. By October, however, the
volume of goods they wanted to move by rail was lower than they had
first indicated.
That was when they decided to produce an interim report to identify
the obstacles. This report found the price of the service was not
comparable to road transport because of the cost of hiring containers or
''swap-body'' equipment, charges by Railtrack, Eurotunnel and French
railways, and loading and unloading.
Equipment itself was also a problem. The boxes available to British
exporters limited the volume of goods carried. Operating times between
Central Scotland and Paris severely restricted service levels to hi-tech
industries, and any change of timing could take up to five months to
implement.
Other costs were blamed on rail privatisation, with the task of
running a train now split between several bodies. SPEED estimated that
only 40% of Mossend's rail freight capacity is being used, which it
fears could decline leading to rail becoming just ''an indirect option
out of English terminals''.
It recommends that SPEED spends more time with a nominated operator to
reach a better understanding of the gap between rail freight costs and
the market price.
SPEED wants the problems made known at a political level. It questions
whether the substantial investment in the Euro Central Terminal can be
made to pay off and whether there is enough support to move freight to
rail without first pricing road to unacceptable levels.

SCOTLAND'S ROADS
The M8 through Glasgow is so congested that time is lost in the
transport of goods; an M74 northern extension would relieve pressure
WHILE work on the M77 extension continues despite the high-profile
protests, plans for another -- potentially more important -- motorway
extension are being considered. Any delay in this one could seriously
threaten jobs, according to an influential industry group.
The M74 extension would complete what is known as the Glasgow
''motorway box'' by linking with the M8 and providing a second motorway
route across the Clyde.
John Henderson, chief executive of SPEED (the Scottish Partnership for
Effective and Economic Distribution), is angry at the lack of public
attention so far to the M74 plans.
''The application for planning permission for the M74 Extension in
January must be welcomed by all of industry and by the Scottish public
who wish to see Scotland's economic well-being maintained and
developed,'' he argues.
SPEED was formed five years ago to represent Scottish manufacturers on
transport, distribution and logistics. Its first members were mainly in
electronics which both works to tight deadlines and exports 77% of its
output.
Since then membership has broadened to other sectors to include
service and infrastructure providers, and development agencies. At the
same time Just In Time manufacturing techniques based on low inventories
have spread to become commonplace.
''The times when raw materials and finished product deliveries were
made without the pressures of Just In Time and very short order
fulfilment times are a thing of the past,'' said Henderson.
''To be able to operate effective manufacturing and to service
customers properly the logistics element has got to be totally
dependable and undertaken in as short a time as practically possible.
''Failure to achieve reliable distribution threatens the very
existance of our manufacturing base, resulting in the loss of orders to
our more efficient competitors elsewhere.
''Within Scotland this threat is even greater due to our peripheral
geographical position and we therefore have to focus more effectively on
the transport infrastructure than our competitors who are closer to the
main markets.''
The bulk of Scotland's electronic exports goes to mainland Europe.
Although incoming raw materials and outgoing finished goods travel by
different modes of transport, road is the common connection.
As well as linking plants with rail terminals and air and sea ports,
it is still the sole method of transport for most journeys of materials.
''For companies in the west central belt of Scotland practically every
material movement requires to move across the centre of Glasgow,'' said
Henderson. ''The reliability of the single M8 link fails to meet the
demands which industry now requires.''
Distribution times for the electronic data processing industry are two
to three days. For the semiconductor industry they are 24 to 36 hours.
''This demands the very latest cut-off time at the despatch bay to meet
the timing of aircraft, rail services or ferry sailings,'' he said.
Many companies had reported to SPEED that these cut-off times have had
to be brought forward by at least an hour in the past few years due to
road congestion. ''This means that less of the day's manufacturing can
be allocated to time-definite sales.
''The completion of a motorway box round the centre of Glasgow would
dramatically relieve this and take a large percentage of lorries off the
Kingston Bridge and Charing Cross section of the M8.''
Extending the M74 would free a way to the main trunk route to England
for one of Scotland's main export areas, Renfrewshire. The largest
percentage of electronic products by volume originate west of the
Kingston Bridge from companies such as IBM and Compaq. The same is true
of other sectors such as whisky.
Raw materials also have to reach these companies by road. ''This also
places demands on traffic moving north and west into Renfrewshire,
Inverclyde and Dunbartonshire,'' said Henderson. ''Considerable
additional industry throughout Scotland is affected by the road
infrastructure in Glasgow.
''There is also the time sensitive air freight into and out of Glasgow
and Prestwick airports that goes to manufacturers east of the Kingston
Bridge. These manufacturers experience the same earlier cut-offs due to
road congestions.''
There is a 50-50 chance that air freight will be driven through
Glasgow twice, because half of it travels to Manchester or London
airports as carriers even-out their loads and make the best use of their
cargo holds.
Henderson said some air cargo services have recently transferred to
Edinburgh partly because they offered better cut-off times to shippers.
''From our experience of industry in Scotland, we do not have the time
available to enter into extended public inquiries into the M74 extension
without the clear danger of losing key manufacturing and distribution
jobs to mainland Europe,'' he said.
''Scotland has already seen some industrial investment from
established multinational companies in Scotland lost to continental
locations due in part to the distribution infrastructure.
''In many potential new investments the logistics issue plays a key
part in the decision-making process. Not only is this a major threat to
the electronics sector.''

ROADS carry around 150 million tonnes of goods uplifted in Scotland
every year and nearly all of Scotland's imports and exports at some
point during their journey.
But they also carry four-fifths of incoming raw materials for industry
throughout the whole of the journey and nearly three-fifths of outgoing
goods.
Yet fuel taxes and vehicle excise duty make British road hauliers most
heavily taxed in the European Union. Unlike their continental
competitors they cannot even claim rebates for the road tolls charged in
many European countries.
Fuel taxes affect Scotland more than the rest of the UK because of its
peripheral position and its widely spread population. The Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution's recommendation for higher fuel
taxes will only widen the gap.
A toll per motorway mile would severely handicap Scotland, with
motorway users outside the central belt paying for congestion elsewhere
and trucks travelling from Scotland through England facing prohibitive
bills.
But a toll per mile of congested motorway, with payments for using
busy motorways in and around conurbations, would be fairer. Scottish
hauliers would pay only for the congested M25 and motorways around
Birmingham and Manchester, along with English competitors, but not for
empty stretches through Cumbria and the Borders.

Britain has had a lead of 10 years over other countries in Europe when
deregulation affects most European voice telephone services in 1998
WHILE the road infrastructure will be the subject of a separate
''breakout'' session at today's conference, the information superhighway
will not, but only because of lack of time.
Telecommunications has a twin effect on the transport infrastructure.
It is a transport mode in its own right, carrying not only information
but exports such as software and millions of pounds worth of share and
currency transactions.
It can also take pressure off transport modes such as road and rail
through the growth of teleworking and teleshopping.
The growth in telecommunications is likely to accelerate with the
deregulation of all European public voice telephone services by January
1, 1998, except for a few countries which the European Commission deems
to have under-developed networks.
Britain had a decade's headstart and is Europe's most competitive
telecommunications market with more service providers than any other
country.
The European software market is estimated to be worth #45bn a year,
four times the value of the electronics or hardware market. Software
applications, programming expertise and even sophisticated
problem-solving services can be exported over the phone lines.
In Europe, Edinburgh is second only to London in terms of the amount
of funds under management. Those funds, around #80bn worth, are
international and are invested in global markets.
Fund managers such as Baillie Gifford handle millions of pounds of
investment business for American pension funds. US banks expect to have
a weekly downloading of information from the fund managers via telecomms
links.
The prestigious address of Ivory &amp; Sime at 1 Charlotte Square houses a
dealing room where up to #200m worth of currency transactions and #20m
of share deals can be handled daily on the multiple screens set into a
purpose-built console. Transactions from the London and Hong Kong
offices are passed to Edinburgh via satellite and cable.
Reliable and secure international telecommunications are essential and
Edinburgh was the pilot for an integrated telephone network using
fibre-optic technology, introducing a new generation of
telecommunications.
Services such as voice mail, video conferencing, image processing and
date broadcasting can be included in city office developments.
Efficient telecommunications can overcome many, though not all the
disadvantages of geography location. For information-based work --
whether back-room clerical tasks in the insurance or financial services
sector, or sophisticated software and computer design -- companies are
free to pick almost any location they want.
That freedom is both a threat and an opportunity. Since Highlands and
Islands Enterprise and BT invested #20m in an advanced digital
telecommunications network for the region, the Network Services Agency,
a BT subsidiary in Inverness, has won contracts for Europe-wide IT
services.
Thurso on Scotland's north coast is the base for 70 BT employees who
solve computer problems for colleagues 600 miles away in London and the
South-east of England.
Office and home-based jobs can be combined. The Grampian, Badenoch and
Strathspey Teleworking Partnership was formed to help overcome a skills
shortage in Aberdeen by contracting out work to rural teleworkers.

THE reasons for the failure to get a direct Scottish export train
running daily to Europe in time for the Channel Tunnel's opening are
revealed in an interim report from the Scottish Partnership for
Effective and Economic Distribution (SPEED), made available exclusively
to The Herald.
The idea of developing rail freight services direct from Scotland to
the Continent was first raised in January last year by the Surface
Distribution Group of SPEED. It realised almost immediately that the
timetabling of such services would not meet the schedules of the
electronics companies in the group.
They also accepted that although electronics firms are major
exporters, they were unlikely to fill a whole train every day. So they
decided to invite whisky exporters to join them in what became known as
SPEED's European Rail Freight Project.
The electronics companies needed a late evening departure from
Scotland and a noon arrival in Paris. The whisky firms needed prices
comparable to what they were already paying.
Having decided that a full daily export train to Paris was viable, the
group asked for timings and costs from rail operators. In July five
operators presented their proposals to the group, although only one
wanted to put a price on its service. The best time offered was 18 hours
with a later departure not available until mid-1995.
Three operators were chosen to receive more details of freight
shipments from the main companies in the group. By October, however, the
volume of goods they wanted to move by rail was lower than they had
first indicated.
That was when they decided to produce an interim report to identify
the obstacles. This report found the price of the service was not
comparable to road transport because of the cost of hiring containers or
''swap-body'' equipment, charges by Railtrack, Eurotunnel and French
railways, and loading and unloading.
Equipment itself was also a problem. The boxes available to British
exporters limited the volume of goods carried. Operating times between
Central Scotland and Paris severely restricted service levels to hi-tech
industries, and any change of timing could take up to five months to
implement.
Other costs were blamed on rail privatisation, with the task of
running a train now split between several bodies. SPEED estimated that
only 40% of Mossend's rail freight capacity is being used, which it
fears could decline leading to rail becoming just ''an indirect option
out of English terminals''.
It recommends that SPEED spends more time with a nominated operator to
reach a better understanding of the gap between rail freight costs and
the market price.
SPEED wants the problems made known at a political level. It questions
whether the substantial investment in the Euro Central Terminal can be
made to pay off and whether there is enough support to move freight to
rail without first pricing road to unacceptable levels.

COMMUTING for work and travel to shops puts the greatest pressure of
numbers on road and rail services, bringing them to a near halt twice a
day during the week and slowing them to a crawl at weekends.
Yet many of these journeys are unnecessary and technology already
exists to remove the need for much of the rest.
Scotland is expected to be the biggest growth area for teleworking
with nearly one in two people thinking they will increase the amount of
time spent working from home, according to the Oxford-based research
firm, SW2000.
Already one in five people in Britain spends at least part of the week
working from home. By the end of this year 2.25 million people will work
from home for three days a week or more. Before the end of the century,
five million people will be doing so.
0 A pilot test of teleworking by BT allowed 10 operators in the
Highlands to work from home for a year. In 12 months they answered
750,000 directory inquiries.
The psychology department of Aberdeen University was commissioned to
monitor the effects. Teleworkers were found to suffer from less stress
than office workers, take less time off through illness and were more
flexible if work patterns had to change.
At weekends, town centres and roads to out-of-town retail warehouses
are choked with traffic, slowing down freight movements which operate
seven days a week.
Yet a report by the Henley Centre for forecasting, Teleculture 2000,
said ''there is tremendous potential for time-saving in certain areas''.
Home banking is already offered by most of the High Street banks and
other financial services are well-established, especially insurance,
pioneered by Direct Line first with car insurance and now with home
insurance.
BT has developed a virtual reality shopping system which will allow
customers to ''walk through'' shops on a personal computer screen and to
make their selection from the ''shelves''. Customers can enter the
''shops'' by steering their way through simulated stores using the kind
of joystick already used for computer games.
Because the system combines computer processing, video storage and
data compression, most of the technology already exists and the
remainder is close to being perfected.
Even more advanced systems will allow you to shop for clothes and to
''try them on'' remotely. A laser scanner can capture personal 3D images
and the system will store a 3D model of yourself.
Using interactive services on a new generation of intelligent
televisions will mean you can try on a dress, a suit, a shirt or a tie
without leaving home.

SCOTLAND'S FERRIES
Modern ferries have been introduced on many Scottish routes but ties
with the islands depend on good roads to the ports
SEA transport links to the islands around Scotland remain vital to the
healthy growth of the communities they serve and improved services can
be shown to result in equally improved economic health.
But part of that future improved health must come from a continuing
development of the infrastructure around our ports, says Colin Paterson,
managing director of Caledonian Macbrayne who will chair the Sea Issues
discussion group during the separate afternoon sessions at today's
conference.
Mike John, managing director of the Currie Line will act as reporter.
''Much of the health of any island depends on its shipping services.
The case for the continuing development of mainland and island ports is
strong,'' said Colin Paterson at CalMac's headquarters on the pierhead
at Gourock terminal. ''I hope we will discuss shore facilities and the
roads to and from shore facilities. That is part of the overall picture
of integrated transport. There may be a case too, when considering links
to Europe for discussion of the possible greater development of little
ports like Dunbar, where traffic could be encouraged.''
At the same time he feels that the case for the construction of more
road bridges between the Scottish mainland and the islands is one that
should be carefully scrutinised. ''Some suggested bridges might not
represent good investment. The economy of an island can actually be
adversely affected by a bridge. When an island is no longer an island,
its attractions alter in tourist terms -- on the one hand, a road link
may make it easier for the delivery of goods but on the other the
tourist, who would once stay for some days, may be content with a fast
day-trip then straight home again.''
Such things apart, he has his own idea of some of the issues he would
like to see featured in the sea group's contribution to the final
conference document.
''Often we are talking about peripheral areas. If people in the
central belt can shout loudest, they are more likely to get their roads
programmes approved than are people in the peripheral areas. There
should be a separate programme for the peripheral areas, and an example
is the way that priority could be given to a new road between Oban and
Mallaig.
''The infrastructure required by shipping at Scottish ports he feels
is largely in place. It is access to these ports that is more of a
problem, to make them more accessible to traffic and more attractive to
tourists.''
At his window, looking out across the Firth, he considered another
aspect.
''We have to be aware of the possible problems ahead resulting from
the reorganisation of local government and the establishing of
single-tier authorities. It is true that Highland Region and the Western
Isles remain relatively unchanged, but in other areas the needs of
transport will no longer be in the hands of a few regional authorities
who have teeth and sometimes use them, but will depend on many
single-tier councils.
''No-one has been given overall responsibility for the co-ordination
of the various forms of transport under the new scheme of things. There
may be a case for the appointment of a transport co-ordinating body,
perhaps controlled by a joint board. But I would suggest a new form, one
in which both elected bodies and the representatives of all modes of
transport take part. It could meet regularly as a conference to consider
the needs of all of the Scottish transport industry.''
Colin Paterson firmly believes that any organisation has to invest to
improve. As proof he points to the way in which every time the CalMac
fleet has been improved there has been an immediate growth in traffic
using the particular island services involved.
''By investing in new vessels, more traffic is stimulated and more
visitors head for the islands. It is a policy we believe in and intend
to continue.''
A clear indication of what lies ahead, the latest addition to the
current CalMac fleet of 31 ships is nearing completion at the Ferguson
Yard at Port Glasgow.
The #14.8m Isle of Lewis, to be launched on April 18, is intended for
the Ullapool-Stornoway route. She will carry up to 1000 passengers and
more than 120 vehicles. CalMac is currently placing a new order for an
18-car ferry to be used on the new Sound of Harris service.
''The Isle of Lewis is the sixth new vessel we have build in recent
years and we have added nine new minor vessels to our fleet. We now have
the largest fleet, operating in UK coastal waters -- and in the summer
we carry out a total of some 700 roll-on-roll-off trips each day.''
The considerably modernised fleet and its steadily increasing services
underlines Colin Paterson's personal view of the potential growth of
coastal traffic. But he also feels it important that the conference
should consider the wider transport picture during their deliberations
at the SECC.
''The bottom line is that simple requirements such as programmes for
buses or trains to meet ferries remain very important to people -- and
getting that right would be a good starting point in any situation.
''But other aspects to be addressed include the general co-ordination
of transport needs, the ensuring that sufficient grants or capital can
be made available for infrastructure requirements and that those all
important access roads are provided for the peripheral areas.''

With journey times to European cities getting shorter, ScotRail
believes its freight terminal at Mossend will play a key role in
Scotland's future prosperity
SCOTLAND'S conference on transport planning could hardly have been
timed better, say railway interests.
''One example is that we are due to be vested -- become a subsidiary
company in our own right -- in the near future,'' said Alex Lynch,
acting director of ScotRail. ''The railway input will be vital to this
conference and we are ready to work with all the other transport
organisations in the country towards success for Scotland.
''We know that people are still getting used to what happened as a
result of re-organisation under the 1993 Transport Act. Our customers
may not see radical changes, but the changes that are already happening
within are important and will matter to them and even more to our
customers of the future.''
ScotRail is impressive by any statistical standard. With a #300m
annual turnover, it operates some 600 trains a day and carries out
170,000 passenger journeys over its 1500 route miles. Add 332 stations
and 4200 staff and its importance is self-evident.
''When a traveller views ScotRail, I like to think that they see a
service which has become more dedicated to the customer,'' said Alex
Lynch. ''We are going through a complexity of change. Perhaps we need a
little more time to put ourselves totally in order, but at the moment we
are trying to deliver the best possible service to customers.''
That includes every one of the 4200 staff having gone through the
''Friendly ScotRail'' programme, a two-day course where the emphasis on
the fact that an important part of their job is to deliver an overall
package of service to the customer.
Rail is currently catering to some 8% of the travelling market in
Scotland. Although figures have already been improving, Alex Lynch
believes ScotRail should look to further improvement.
''Now we are free to concentrate on driving and maintaining the trains
which we lease from Railtrack, we are working hard on developing a
closer relationship between customers and staff.
''Our plans for future improvements of facilities and service are
prepared. We are certainly optimistic about the future and this
conference gives us an opportunity to clearly state our purpose and
remind people that we know there is a lot to be done.
''Some of it is being done already, reflecting the result of customer
research and special customer 'surgeries'. But like the other new
companies much of our hoped-for plans are tied to future funding
levels.''
A more immediate increase in business is expected to flow from the
Enterprise service of TransRail, which was formed in April last year as
Trainload Freight West, since when it has won more than 500,000 tonnes
of new freight, mainly in Scotland. It is expected to move into the
private sector next year.
It means companies moving as little as 25 tonnes of freight could find
rail an attractive alternative to road. The new flexibility offered by
TransRail could change the rail freight map.
At present little or no freight moves by rail north of Inverness, but
companies in Caithness and Sutherland are showing interest in the new
option.
The service could also link well with shipping, even over short
distances, and initial talks have been held with one major port over
restoring rail lines to the quayside.
Plans and hopes also predominate at Mossend, one of the other trump
cards in the railways bidding for its share of Scotland's transport
future.
It has been open for freight business since June last year and now has
a scheduled throughput of 127 wagons each weekday. Full name, the
Eurocentral Rail Freight Terminal, it is the Scottish terminal into the
pan-European rail network covering some 240,000 kilometres.
Its freightliner activity is being separated from Channel Tunnel
business and set up as a separate company under the Government's
privatisation programme.
''Mossend is part of a railfreight distribution network of five United
Kingdom hubs,'' said terminal manager Ken Duffy. ''The others are at
Willesden, Birmingham, Manchester and Port of Liverpool. All offer
direct access to the prime business markets of mainland Europe.
''The Government has said that Channel Tunnel railfreight services
will initially remain within the public sector. Once Railfreight
Distribution's new international freight business is firmly established
in the marketplace, decisions on future ownership can be taken on a
robust basis.''
Mossend's 16-acre Eurocentral terminal is regarded as ideally located
to provide rapid access to the key industrial areas of Scotland.
Established at a cost of #8.6m it has the capacity to handle up to
400,000 tonnes of freight per year and the Lanarkshire Development
Agency who constructed the terminal, also plans to develop a #45m
freight village over a 127-acre site beside it offering warehousing and
servicing facilities.
Ken Duffy regards transit times from Mossend as telling their own
story.
''Bordeaux is 38 hours away, Madrid 53, Basle 38, Manheim 46, and it
is 40 hours to Milan. Mossend has a capacity to handle up to 74,000
unitised loads a year.
''We are in fact Scotland's rail gateway to Europe.''
Forecasts for Mossend's future include the fact that it is part of an
800-acre greenfield site which has a potential to support some 8000 jobs
over the next 10-15 years.
''It would generate more than #250m of investment,'' said Ken Duffy.
His firm belief is that Mossend with its faster rail link to Europe
will be the catalyst for one of Scotland's most important industrial
developments in decades.

Scotland's hauliers appear to be getting a raw deal when compared with
their European counterparts
TWO of the men who represent the interests of many of the army of road
transport operators who earn their living on Scotland's roads share a
common hope when it comes to considering the future.
Wylie Cunningham, the Road Haulage Association's director for Scotland
and Paul Guzzan, outgoing Scottish chairman of the Freight Transport
Association, both declare the need for Scotland to be afforded a ''level
playing field'' for road transport.
''It is not just in terms of going into Europe,'' said Wylie
Cunningham. ''Even in England we can be more than 400 miles from local
competition. We believe that in fairness Scotland should be sensibly
favoured in terms of Government policy.''
His 1000 members -- they operate several thousand vehicles between
them -- make up much of the higher and reward professional haulage side
of the industry. ''Today we have to consider situations like 'cabotage'
which can allow some foreign hauliers to deliver goods in this country
then perform certain domestic operations within the United Kingdom
before returning across the channel.
''When we cross the channel we have to face a situation where hauliers
in some countries are recompensed for the need to pay motorway tolls by
being awarded much reduced excise duties. The UK industry is the highest
duty rated in Europe. Where a UK operator is taxed at up to #3000 for a
38-tonne vehicle, the same vehicle would cost a French operator only
#150. We also have to absorb high fuel duties.
Distances between destinations in Scotland, he feels, should also be
featured in any final conference document and he points to the way in
which Scotland, with roughly one-third of the UK land mass, also has 10%
of the UK population.
''If anything, our proposed level playing field should be tilted
towards Scotland.''
He is a firm believer in the view that roads have to be accepted as a
vital part of industrial regeneration. He feels that road transport, as
a service industry, has to be given careful and rational consideration
of the need for future planning and infrastructure requirements.
Another of the issues currently confronting hauliers is the effect of
new vehicle emission regulations now in place. There, he feels, a
balance has to be struck between the interests of the environment and
the most recent of technical advances.
''I will be keenly interested in what I hear at today's SECC
conference,'' said Wylie Cunningham. ''Its conclusions and
recommendations to Government will be important to all Scottish
hauliers.''
Paul Guzzan takes the same viewpoint in his role as Scottish Chairman
of the Freight Transport Association's Scottish branch. With
headquarters in Stirling, it has some 1800 members who can be involved
in freight transport by road, rail, sea or air. Members also operate
regional and municipal council fleets.
''But in many instances the key issue has to be better roads,'' he
said. ''Roads are the backbone of it all. When I compare the amount of
motorway mileage in the South of England to our own situation, Scotland
is at an unfair disadvantage. We need a fairer share of motorways.''
Gaps in Scotland's road network are clearly identified by his
membership. They include the need for a major updating of roads between
Glasgow and Aberdeen along with improved access along the A96 in the
North of Scotland.
''Much work may have been done on the M74, but a lot more work needs
to be done on it and to be done much more quickly than in the past.''
Like their Road Haulage Association colleagues, his members also feel
strongly about existing regulations regarding overall lorry weight
limits.
''As things stand, the situation is ridiculous,'' he said. ''Europe
operates its freight vehicles up to a 40-tonne limit. Yet operators in
the United Kingdom are held down to a 38-tonne limit -- and things are
intended to stay that way until the beginning of 1999.
''To be even one tonne overweight brings a heavy fine. It is one more
factor which places Scottish operators at a severe cost disadvantage
when up against competing European operators.
''We will continue to press our case for an urgent reconsideration of
the whole position. We want to see a new 44-tonne limit applied in the
UK. Scottish operators are aware that any talk of heavier vehicles can
bring an immediate storm of protest from communities who live alongside
the main routes.''
His own hopes for the conference include that it will accept that,
come what may, the lorry will be recognised as a vital link in any
transport overview of the situation.
''It must be a conference which gives consideration and a hearing to
all -- not just views from people behind desks. We need more roads, we
need more infrastructure, we need more understanding of the need for
Scottish industry to be allowed to compete on that level playing field
in England as well as in Europe.''

SCOTLAND'S transport infrastructure has an unfinished look. Its two
main cities are not linked by a complete motorway and there is only one
full dual carriageway link to England and the enormous continental
market which lies beyond. There is no full dual carriageway road to the
North of Scotland.
Roads carry around 150 million tonnes of goods uplifted in Scotland
every year. About 80% of industry's raw materials enter Scotland by road
and 58% of finished products leave - 85% for the electonics sector.
Though rail freight had fallen from 12 million to seven million tonnes
of freight in the seven years to 1992, it still accounts for an
estimated 11% of incoming raw materials though only 2% of outgoing
goods.
This should increase with Channel Tunnel services but it will in turn
increase demand for upgrading the West Coast Main Line rail link south,
which has hardly changed for 20 years. Loss of passengers to air and
road is already bringing pressure for upgrading.
RailTrack and the Government are committed to upgrading but not to the
estimated #2000m cost. New rolling stock would cost extra.
Tunnels and bridges are already being enlarged to take Eurostar
passenger trains and ''swop body'' freight trains which will use the
Channel Tunnel. Further enlargement to allow for ''piggy-back trains''
carrying whole lorry trailers, could attract more business but would
need further investment.
Coastal shipping carries around 30 million tonnes but about 100,000
tonnes pass through Scottish ports. Of goods specifically for industry,
8% of raw materials but 39% of finished products go by sea. Measured by
value, those percentages fall to 5% and 19%, although they are higher
for electronics.
Air, ideal for high-value goods, brings in around 45% of raw
materials, taking out 24% of electronics goods and 38% of other finished
products.
To make the most of investment in transport, the infrastructure must
be as flexible as possible. Transport connections are only as reliable
as their least reliable part.

Is there a lesson to be learned from Forth Ports' enterprising
approach?
RESPONDING to business opportunity should be a reflex action, says
Forth Ports plc. Their own brisk response to changing circumstances also
reflects their geographical position as they service the needs of
Scottish industry.
Recognising altered freight patterns, coming side by side with
increasing customer demands for improved efficiency in sea transport
communication, they have maintained a drive to provide better support
services. Faster vessel turn-round times, quality of services and
integrated port facilities aimed at reducing clients' distribution costs
are among the claimed benefits.
''The prospects for our business are most encouraging with steady
growth in the ports sector,'' said Mr Hugh Thompson their chief
executive. ''New opportunities are being progressed at Rosyth and on the
River Mersey and Birkenhead. Our property company has also made a major
contribution to our affairs and this is an ongoing situation with profit
and income generated from current and planned development over the next
few years.''
Current illustrations include Grangemouth, where daily containership
sailings, sea boxes shipped out to the major ports of Europe and
southern England to be trans-shipped on to world-wide destinations. At
Leith, continental car manufacturers complement bringing up their new
models from southern ports by road transporter by additional sea
deliveries to the quayside -- numbers can amount to 1600 vehicles aboard
one vessel.
Since privatisation, Forth Ports plc claims to have consolidated its
position as ''Scotland's most important port complex''. Profitability is
being matched by a sustained programme of investment and growth
ambitions are not restricted by the limits of the Firth of Forth. An
agreement has been reached with Twelve Quays Ltd at Birkenhead which
will see them involved in the development of a terminal on the Mersey,
handling Ro-Ro and passenger traffic in the Irish Sea.
Forth Ports management has in general carried out a sustained drive to
offer shippers a fast and most comprehensive service with improved flows
of consignments, information, and reliability on delivery times.
Grangemouth, the estuary's principal port for the movement of
commodities, has seen the establishment of new container services and a
rise in the number of shippers using them for the first time with a
resultant increase in throughput tonnage.
Principal ports linked to Grangemouth by liner service include
Rotterdam, Antwerp, Thamesport and Southampton. Sailings have also been
made to test the market for deliveries of finished products from
Grangemouth to Russia. Bridge Baltic and their agents Fred Olsen have
direct sailings both to St Petersburg and the less congested Finnish
port of Kotka. Both sailings are believed to have potential growth.
Grangemouth is also benefiting from increased tonnages of forest
products, a result in the upswing in activity of construction related
industry.
New business cargoes through the port will also result from the
completion of a hi-tech fishmeal factory to be constructed at a cost of
several million pounds by Biomar, jointly owned by a Danish company and
by Norsk Hydro. Grangemouth was chosen because of its mix of available
land, services and motorway links.
At Leith, serving the offshore oil and gas centre, fluctuations
between high and low activity which are part of these industries are
taken for granted but Forth Ports has made a point of broadening its
commercial base and attracting new business.
In addition to pipe imports and materials for treatment, staple bulk
cargoes now include forest products, grain, fertiliser and coal. Raw
materials come in from Africa and the West Indies.
At Dunbar, Blue Circle operators of the town's major cement works have
established a new export terminal with a 1200-tonne silo capacity for
cement exports to the Norwegian market.
Burntisland and Methil have also had their share of new investment,
underpinning the prosperity of their local community. Hound Point, sited
on the estuary and Braefoot Bay, on the Fife shore, are important to the
oil, gas and petrochemical operations of BP and Shell-Exxon. Underlining
that Forth Ports have just commissioned the tug Fidra built on the
Mersey at a cost of #3.5m, under the terms of a new 10-year agreement
with Shell the Marine terminal operators.

SHIPS and the sea are once again consolidating their position at the
centre of the West of Scotland's transport infrastructure.
''Port facilities along the estuary are enjoying a rebirth,'' claimed
John Mather, executive chairman of Clydeport Operations Ltd. ''We are
consolidating our position as a major gateway for the export and import
of a variety of products and commodities.''
One of the main reasons he sees for the return of steady growth across
Clydeport's market sector is the sheer economic attraction of shipping
as transportation.
''In an increasingly competitive environment we are working to provide
a flexible service, responsive to the changing needs of the market. We
are constantly innovating and investing the best equipment.''
Examples of the way in which the tide is turning for the Clyde are
many. Purchased from British Steel in October 1993, the Hunterston Coal
Terminal in Ayrshire is spearheading what is happening. Since the
purchase it has handled over one million tonnes of coal from all over
the world, creating 50 new jobs and employing more than 100 people in
the local community.
Always recognised as one of Europe's finest deep water facilities, the
Hunterston Terminal has outstripped all performance targets. Coal is
trans-shipped to markets including France, Spain and Scandinavia. Coal
imported from Colombia, Australia and Europe is destined for Kilroot
Power Station in Ireland.
Now contributing more than #100,000 a week to the Ayrshire economy,
the Clydeport plan to make Hunterston the fastest and most
cost-effective operation of its kind in Europe is regarded as being well
on the way to being realised.
John Mather is equally proud of the way in which Greenock Ocean
Terminal is enjoying matching success. Among significant container
traffic increases to Europe, new weekly services to Bilbao meet the
current growing overseas demand for whisky.
''The Ocean Terminal is now handling Canadian wood pulp and at the
same time we are making significant inroads into the cruise ship
market.''
The latter included the QE2 sailing into Greenock as part of her
Silver Jubilee cruise round Britain -- a proud moment in Clydeport
history.
Illustrating current trends, docks and quays along the estuary have
seen a brisk range of traffic operations during the past few weeks. The
list, which includes Greenock and Rothesay Dock, Stobcross Quay and
Meadowside, King George V Dock, Shieldhall and Riverside Quay have
handled cargoes which have encompassed scrap metal, minerals, grain,
whisky, container traffic, and a range of heavy plant for export to
Spain and France.
Important factors in the Clyde's continuing good fortune are regarded
as including on-going investment and the recent upgrading of transport
links. The latter include recent M8 upgrading which has brought benefits
to Greenock Ocean Terminal in terms of transportation to either the
centre of Glasgow or Glasgow Airport.
''A well-equipped and efficient port, one which enjoys excellent road,
rail and air links as Clydeport does, can play a major role in the
future of Scotland's transport sector,'' said John Mather. ''In an
increasingly competitive environment we are working to provide a
flexible service which can be responsive to the changing needs of the
market.''
He considers another major asset in the task is the strength of
Clydeport's management team.
''We are confident that we will be able to further develop our
operations to take advantage of strategic opportunities. As the months
and years pass, the Clyde will continue to re-establish its place at the
hub of Scotland's transport infrastructure.''

THE term ''airport of community interest'' does not convey much.
However, in the context of the European Union it has a specific, and
potentially beneficial connotation, particularly from a Scottish
viewpoint when it applies to Glasgow Airport.
It means that such an airport is recognised as being of strategic
importance and becomes eligible for injections of EU cash for a new
runway or improvements to its access infrastructure.
Airports of community interest are akin to a European Super League,
recognised officially by the EU as being of much greater significance
than those which are merely of regional or local importance. Thus the
designation of Glasgow as an ACI at the last European Summit in Corfu is
good news for the airport.
It is, however, better news for the bodies who make up the Glasgow
Airport Initiative and who are cautiously optimistic about the spin-off
benefits the airport's eminence should generate.
''The real significance of this positive decision by the European
ministers may have escaped the notice of many,'' said Mike Sandys,
director of the Glasgow Airport Inititative.
''But it really is important. Glasgow now joins London and Manchester
in the UK in being recognised as a key engine of economic growth.''
Sandys is confident that the EU's good intentions will translate into
hard cash and believes that ACI status for the airport will have a
positive effect on the initiative's ability to help deliver its forecast
12,000 jobs for Renfrewshire, plus 4000 across central Scotland.
And while the continuing growth of the airport is of importance in
achieving economic expansion, there are fears that this will be
constrained if the passengers and freight carriers cannot reach it
easily because of poor road and rail links.
''The success of the Airport Initiative hinges on the expansion of the
airport,'' said Mike Sandys.
''In turn that cannot be maximised without improved infrastructure. We
have to encourage everyone to get behind the new motorway and rail
links.''
The links to which he refers are the northern extension to the M74,
the building of the crossrail link over the Clyde in Glasgow and the
construction of a rail link to the airport.
The figures involved are substantial -- #250m for the M74, #77m for
crossrail and #28.5m for the airport spur. But these, believes Sandys,
are costs which must be faced. ''The European Union has confidence in
the potential of the airport as the engine of growth -- but engines need
serviced. We mustn't let this one seize up.''
This is a view echoed by the man at the helm of transport at
Strathclyde Region, Councillor Charles Gordon, Chair of the Roads and
Transportation Committee.
''The most topical issue is the planning application for the northern
extension of the M74 which is with Glasgow District Council,'' he
declares. ''Everyone who is involved in this scheme should make sure
they play a full part in the planning process.''
Strathclyde is behind plans to create a rail link to Glasgow Airport
-- to the extent that provision for half of the estimated cost is still
in the capital budget, with the remainder to be sought from a variety of
other funding partners.
Councillor Gordon, however, concedes that the project is very much
dependent upon the building of crossrail, to bridge the gap between the
north and south of the city ''our number one commitment'' to enable rail
travellers from all over Scotland to reach the airport without having to
change trains.
He concludes: ''If Glasgow Airport is to optimise its potential as one
of the key parts of the West of Scotland economy, it would benefit
enormously from the rail link and the M74 extension.''
Vernon Murphy, managing director of Scottish Airports Ltd, has seen
the number of passengers using Glasgow rising steadily.
The year-on-year increase recorded in December was 8.8%, making
Glasgow a 5.5 million passenger airport.
Murphy, not surprisingly, is keen to ensure that these statistics
continue their upward momentum, despite the loss last year of some
transatlantic services ''a disappointment, but not a body blow'' he
maintains. More people are flying every year, the argument goes. And
this means that even if they cannot reach their final destination
non-stop from Glasgow they will still use the airport to begin their
journey.
Murphy's principal concern is that growth should not be constrained.
That means he is firmly behind the M74 extension.
''I believe it is important,'' he states, ''our access infrastructure
must be improved.''
He sees the M8, with its attendant delays in and out of Glasgow as the
airport's Achilles heel, a state of affairs he emphasises by pointing
from the window to the crawling lines of traffic on the nearby elevated
section.
''A lot of the problem is unreliability rather than mere journey
times,'' he asserts. ''It is impossible to predict how long it will take
to get to and from here. All it needs is a breakdown or a little shunt
and the traffic is backed up for miles.''
On the need for the rail link he is, he claims, willing to be
convinced.
''If a viable option comes up we will support it in terms of financial
contributions and promotion, but I would have to say I am a little
concerned about viability.''
Like others, he awaits the results of feasibility studies being
carried out by Strathclyde Region. ''We have to remember that it is not
just the construction costs which have to be taken into account, but
also the operating costs,'' he adds. ''We have to know who will pick up
the bill.''

What has Ireland done to increase its tourist trade over the past 10
years?
TOURISM is not only an industry, it should be our most successful, but
restrictions on air services are hindering it, according to Mathew
Hudson, chairman of Prestwick Airport's operators, PIK Limited.
''The tourist industry is extremely diverse,'' he said. ''It consists
of a large number of businesses throughout Scotland, most independently
owned and operated. It is the quintessential 'cottage' industry.
''This cottage industry is national with all that word implies.
Whether we are selling 'short breaks' of two to four days, a week, or a
fortnight we are in competition with many other national tourist
industries.''
By far the largest market for tourism is the export market: visitors
from abroad, and the best form of transport for most of them is air.
''Our National Business Plan is fatally flawed because we do not have
an appropriate delivery mechanism which connects us to the international
gateway, London,'' said Hudson, who will be chairing the air session in
today's conference.
''We do not have a direct air delivery system capable of accessing our
prime markets at a cost which allows us to compete effectively with
other national products. We do not have a Scottish aviation policy.
''Most, if not all value added industries in Scotland, are thus
needlessly handicapped. This includes not only tourism but other sectors
such as electronics.''
As a diverse cottage industry, tourism should be able to rely on
government to fulfill its traditional role of organising and assisting
the means of production and the selling and delivery of the product,
argues Hudson.
''Instead our Government erects barriers against Scotland: not in the
form of tariff walls or anything quite so obvious but through the
erection of regulatory barriers against effective and cost-efficient air
transport systems.
''Even more insidious, none of our competitors, including the English,
suffer from such barriers.
Hudson compares the experience of Scotland and Ireland over the past
10 years, during which the number of international visitors to Scotland
has declined while those to Ireland has increased.
Ireland, from being a distant second, now leads. The two countries
have similar landscapes and cultural heritage, the same language,
climate, outdoor activities, and are a similar distance from the same
international gateway -- London.
In 1985 Ireland's air connections to London were provided by the
Government-owned carriers, British Airways and Aer Lingus.
''The route was a shared monopoly with fares to match,'' said Hudson.
The next year a small private Irish carrier, Ryanair, began to serve
the Ireland- London route with a fare of #99 return. The route grew to
900,000 passengers that year.
Eight years later, Ryanair had reduced its fare to #59 return, there
were five carriers and three million passengers on the route, and
Ireland had overtaken Scotland in tourism.
''Scotland still suffers the same financial remoteness from the
gateway,'' said Hudson. ''The cost of air fares between London and
Scotland still handcuffs the Scottish economy just as Ireland was
handicapped 10 years ago.
''There is nothing to choose between the Irish and Scottish tourism
product except for the delivery mechanism. Ten years ago the delivery
mechanisms were similar and Scotland outsold Ireland.
''Ireland improved its delivery mechanism and now outsells Scotland.''
Hudson uses the Scotland- Ireland services as another example, taking
passenger numbers in November 1993 as a base line. ''Scotland-Ireland
was served by Aer Lingus and BAA (Abbotsinch). The route was an
effective monopoly. Fares reflected the lack of competition.
''By November 1993 traffic had been in decline for several years.
Using passenger numbers then as a unit of measurement, we would have
anticipated a fall for Aer Lingus to 97% or less by November 1994.''
Then in May 1994 Ryanair began operating from Prestwick to Dublin.
''Return fares were from #55 as little as 25% off many of the Aer Lingus
fares.''
Six months into the new service, Aer Lingus had increased its own
traffic to 103% of the numbers the year before. ''On the other hand, the
new Prestwick service reached 154%.
''After only six months of operation the new low-cost air service had
increased traffic on the Scotlnad/Ireland route to 257% in what had been
a declining market.
''Scotland's tourist industry needs low air fares supported by
targeted route-by-route foreign marketing.''

IN a remote cottage on the shores of Loch Torridon, retired
maxillo-facial surgeon Peter Barton is putting the finishing touches to
his magnum opus -- an opera entitled The Scarlet and The Black -- that
has taken him more than 30 years to write.
In three-parts, the work is based on an eighteenth century French
novel, Le Rouge et Le Noir, set around the stormy backdrop of
post-revolution France, with as its central character a ruthless peasant
who, to cut a long story short, cold-heartedly seduces women in his
relentless pursuit of social stature.
Now Barton has sent copies of his work to the Welsh, Scottish and
Canadian national opera companies but despite favourable reviews, he is
not hopeful that he will ever see it performed, somewhat modestly
describing his work as ''the ultimate foolishsness''.
''Welsh National broke my heart,'' he said wistfully, ''saying it
would be ideal for their travelling company but they had no money at the
moment.''
But it is not as a surgeon, or indeed a composer, that Barton is best
known: rather it is as a landscape artist, whose obvious command of his
craft is matched only by his prodigious output.
Concentrating mainly on mountainscapes -- he is still a keen
hillwalker at the age of 73 -- he holds about six solo exhibitions a
year, mainly at commercial galleries and universities.
Barton retired from surgery at the age of 62 and took no further
interest in his former profession.
It's a decision he doesn't regret, as afficionados of his individual
style, which encompasses both non-presentational and abstract works,
hungrily devour everything he can produce.
''To think that you produce a good abstract by just hurling some paint
around is absolute nonsense. You're not trying to represent anything at
all. Abstraction is what it means, it's like Brussels sprout soup. You
can't see the sprouts but you can still taste them.''
So where does a man who has written an opera, an authoritative book on
climbing in Wester Ross and produced countless paintings go from here?
''That's the trouble,'' he mused. ''We're always looking forward and
it's a total waste of time. I don't think I'm going anywhere. I enjoy
painting because it interests me. I think that every time you have a
blank canvas in front of you, you sort of think the sky's the limit, but
after about three hours you realise how ordinary you really are.''
Meanwhile, Barton is spending three hours each day scoring the band
parts for his opera while still preparing for next year's exhibitions.
His work is on permanent display at Hanover Fine Arts in Edinburgh's
Dundas Street and at Riverside Galleries in his home village of
Shieldaig.
Next year will see exhibitions throughout Scotland, details of which
can be had direct from the artist himself at Buchanan Cottage,
Shieldaig, Ross-shire or by telephoning 0520-755292.
In the unlikely event that you don't like what you see, you'll find
the trip worthwhile, if only to Peter Barton's rich store of anecdotes,
which reflect the philosophy of a man with a zest for living and the
ability to enjoy it.

IT is revealing of both Scotland's transport infrastructure and of
Scottish Airports' business that Vernon Murphy's worries are at ground
level.
Glasgow Airport, with more than three million passengers, last year
achieved a bigger increase in numbers than either Heathrow or Gatwick.
Murphy's main concerns are the congestion of the M8 linking Glasgow
Airport to its customer and lack of a complete motorway link between the
country's two biggest cities.
''I can't think of anywhere in the UK that wouldn't get two cities
like Edinburgh and Glasgow linked by motorway,'' he said. ''The M8 is
the problem in Glasgow -- that and the need to complete the motorway
box.
''The one real way of getting through Glasgow is increasingly
congested. It is not the actual journey time: what people are not
prepared to put up with is not knowing whether they will be sitting on
the Kingston Bridge seeing the flight take off.''
He is confident that where enough demand for an air service exists, it
will be provided. ''The airlines have shown that if they need to pick up
at both airports to get the right passenger mix, they will do so.''
Scottish Airports, as the owner of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen
airports, can set landing charges so that it is worth the airlines'
while picking up at two airports.
''We have structured our charges so that they don't pay any more and
they are prepared to do double pick-ups.''
Air France on the Paris service, Sabena on the Brussels route and
British Midland to Copenhagen call at Glasgow and Edinburgh. Air UK
called at Aberdeen and Edinburgh with its Amsterdam service. ''It is
based on what the customer wants,'' said Murphy. ''United Airlines tried
an executive coach service from Edinburgh to Glasgow. ''You could check
in at Edinburgh and have a guaranteed seat from Glasgow. It just didn't
work and it didn't attract people.''
Last year's loss of direct transatlantic services by United Airlines
and Northwest produced a wailing and gnashing of teeth from the business
community but no sign of a preparedness to pay business-class prices.
The presence of United probably owed much to Scottish Airports'
marketing and goodwill to Scotland within the airline. Its departure
owed everything to the need to maximise the return on the expensive
capital investment that is a plane by moving it to faster-growing
Pacific routes.
Next week American Airlines returns to the route after a winter
sabbatical and British Airways has since January been operating an
enhanced service from Glasgow to New York with a second leg on to
Boston.
''The whole thing centres on business traffic,'' he said. ''The
difference between scheduled and charter services is business travel.
The leisure traveller is less concerned for the flexibility of tickets.
''Between 1992 and 1994 business traffic in Scotland declined.''
This was after the worst of the recession. ''On international services
in Scotland business traffic had declined by more than 10%, that was
quite dramatic.
''For eight years BA put on a direct service to Paris at 7am with a
flight back in the evening. If BA, with their travel agent loyalty and
Air Miles, cannot make that pay after eight years, who can?
The reason may have more to do with the structure of Scottish business
rather than the air industry. ''You do not have the corporate or head
offices in Scotland. You often find offices away from the centre have
more tightly controlled costs.''
Scottish Airports has told the Government that it supports Prestwick
in its arguments over fifth freedom. ''It is a point worth arguing,''
says Murphy.
Elsewhere he believes there is scope for new carriers to emerge.
''Over the next couple of years, if the economy improves, you could find
new low-cost carriers gaining the confidence to start new services.''
The leisure traveller is proving more predictable. While the overall
number of transatlantic scheduled services may be down this year, there
will for example be 12 flights a week to Orlando.
Murphy added: ''We have to decide where we are going in terms of
attracting airlines. There is no point in attracting airlines which
businessmen won't support.''

AIR TRANSPORT
AIR transport means two things for industry: business travel and air
freight, and sometimes all that separates them is the cabin floor.
For beneath the polished shoes of businessmen flying to contract
negotiations in Frankfurt or New York are tonnes of ''belly-holed''
freight.
At other times dedicated freighters, some in familiar airline
liveries, others with names such as Polar Air and Cargolux, take
entirely different routes.
For business travel, Scottish companies have to add management time
and money to their budgets, perhaps as much as #50,000 a year according
to one director.
A weekly flight to London would add more than #200 per executive for
air fares. Late or early meetings, or inconvenient connecting flights,
could add a similar amount for hotel bills. The cost of management time
would double the total bill.
Air freight is even more important to the Scottish economy. Measured
by weight, only 1% of incoming raw materials and outgoing products
travel by air. Yet measured by value, that percentage rises to 48% for
incoming materials and 38% for outgoing goods.
More than #3m worth of components for Scotland's electronics industry
are flown in and more than #2m worth of finished products are flown out
every year.
Yet one-third of the raw materials arriving by air comes through
English airports. More than half of the finished electronics products
being flown out will do so by English airports.
In fact more than half of Scotland's total air cargo travels by road
overnight to Manchester and London airports as airlines balance out
loads between their different services. They then either fly them direct
to the destination airport or into a freight hub for transfer to another
flight.
Scotland's airports have increased their competitiveness and
flexibility. The proportion of air cargo from the electronics sector
exported direct from a Scottish airport last year was nearly half,
compared to nearly a quarter in the previous year. The proportion of raw
materials flown in direct was nearly two- thirds.
By the end of last year's third quarter, Glasgow Airport was handling
21,646 tonnes of cargo across all sectors, up 29.7% on the previous
year; Prestwick annual cargo traffic was above 12,000 tonnes, showing a
50% increase on the previous year; and Edinburgh was handling 2853
tonnes, an increase of 254.4% mainly due to DHL setting up operations
there.
Royal Mail handled another 27,000 tonnes at Edinburgh and 5000 tonnes
at Glasgow. Scottish Airports BAA subsidiary, is spending more than #6m
on improved cargo facilities at the two airports.
Sophisticated cargo handling allied to simpler EU customs procedures
can reduce the amount of time cargo sits on the ground, and Scotland's
airports have advantages over English airports.
Imports and exports clearance on goods flown via London can be
completed in Scotland, saving days in some cases. Scottish Airports'
target is to have 95% of air cargo cleared in four hours.
Despite the trend towards deregulation, international air transport
remains bound by a web of bilateral agreements whose clauses have more
to do with trade-offs than an integrated policy.
These agreements grant the two countries a number of ''freedoms'' at
each other's airports, such as the right to pick up and carry passengers
and cargo between those countries. Restrictions on the ''fifth
freedom'', the right to carry them on to a third country, is hampering
the movement of air freight through Scotland.
Cargolux was last year granted a temporary fifth freedom to fly from
Houston and pick up cargo at Prestwick for delivery to Luxembourg, and
from Luxembourg to take cargo from Prestwick to Seattle.
According to the position paper prepared by Dr Alan McKinnon of
Heriot-Watt Business School for today's conference, ''the denial of
'fifth freedom rights' to air freight operators wishing to pick up and
drop off consignments at UK airports on route between other countries .
. . is undoubtedly constraining the growth of air freight traffic at
Prestwick.''
John Henderson, chief executive of SPEED, the Scottish Partnership for
Effective and Economic Distribution, believes air cargo is being used as
''a political pawn'' in bilateral talks with the US.

THE sun has been shining brightly on Blue Circle Industries in recent
months. The shares jumped 10p to 294p yesterday and, with most of its
problems history, the question now is what it has in mind for
acquisitions -- and where. Sadly, the European ventures overall, apart
from Italy, have so far been unsatisfactory in terms of return on
capital employed. In view of this, one might expect the targets to be
around the Pacific Rim or that there will be further expansion in South
America. The existing Malaysian, Singaporean and Chilean activities show
what can be done in these areas.
While stated pre-tax profits were ahead 11% to #185m, the underlying
improvement was about 47% to #244m with the picture obscured by
exceptional write-offs arising chiefly from the disposal of the New
World gas cooker business to a management buy-out.
Inevitably, the concentration is on the UK cement activities, where
there has been a 3% improvement in market share to 49%. Prices overall
were little changed at #46.70 per tonne, although that conceals a switch
from high margin bagged to bulk deliveries.
Volume was 15% higher, leaving the company operating at 90% of its 7.5
million tonne theoretical capacity. Prices have since risen by 4% and
should boost operating margins, which in 1993 were just 13%, through
last year's 20% to about 26%. One concern is that importers, who account
for 9% of the UK market, may withdraw a little. The European economy is
improving, and the French market in particular is attracting the
attention of the low cost and occasionally subsidised Mediterranean
producers.
Chief executive Keith Orrell-Jones did warn that while the first half
would be good, the outlook for the second six months is uncertain.
Construction orders are down 25% -- Taylar Woodrow was at the sharp
end on Tuesday confirming the general uneasiness. Mr Orrell-Jones
indicated there could be a mere 2% rise in volume in the period.
However, that could be offset by further cost cutting and efficiency
gains.
Progress last year on that score was quite startling, with a 22% rise
in tonnage produced to 3250 tonnes per man year, with some plants such
as Dunbar appreciably better.
Elsewhere at home, the heating side was hit by continuing pressure at
Myson and Potterton, although bathrooms benefited from increased
efficiency at the Armitage Shanks operations.
Altogether, the UK -- including the half-owned Aalborg white cement
associate based in Denmark, where progress has still to be achieved
after several years of hiatus -- accounted for 35% of trading profits.
There was some embarrassment over continuing problems, with
outstanding litigation and another possible #5m write-off on hospital
waste treatment equipment -- but Blue Circle preferred to stay mum on
that score yesterday.
It has taken in #15.2m of profits from Bluewater Park, where there are
substantial surpluses to come in future years, although there will be
nothing in 1995. Thanks to the sterling efforts of former lobbyist Dame
Angela Rumbold MP, Blue Circle now has control of the Ebbsfleet
development in Kent as a stopping point on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.
This could lead in time to the development of Eurocity on that site.
The US has been a success story, with a 49% improvement to #48.6m
helped by continuing better cement prices and a rising demand for
imports.
Chile remains buoyant as the company continues to reap the benefits of
investing in the country when it was under a political cloud. Even
Nigeria has thrown up strong profits growth, although the on-going
quality of earnings is conjectural given the political situation.
General expectations are for profits of #270m or so this time round to
leave the shares trading at 12 times likely earnings. This seems a fair
rating -- UK caution will offset overseas growth in market perception.
The dividend total has been raised 4.4% to 11.75p.

TODAY'S Scottish Chambers of Commerce transport conference in the SECC
in Glasgow, to be attended by several hundred delegates, has the slogan
Getting Scotland Moving.
They represent a combined Scottish Chambers' membership of 8500 from
sole proprietor companies to multi-nationals, covering almost every
aspect of business and industry, a strong unaffiliated and firmly
non-political voice for the business community.
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, the host, has a membership of more than
2100 businesses and was founded in 1783. It is the oldest in the English
speaking world and began at a time when businessmen in what the small
town of Glasgow needed an independent gathering point.
British Affiliated Chambers represent more than 212,000 businesses in
a cross section of the business community throughout the United Kingdom,
Scotland has five core Chambers -- Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee
and Tayside, and Central Scotland. Associated local chambers can be in
the smallest of towns and some have as few as 10 members.
But all continue in the purpose for which the Glasgow Chamber was
established more than two centuries ago -- that independent gathering
point not related to the provision of public services, a private sector
organisation funded by its members.

Norman Hunter learns of a marine initiative on the Clyde borne of
frustration with standards of service in preparation for an Atlantic
crossing.
YACHTSMAN Melvyn Percy became so fed up with the standard of service
when preparing his boat for the 3000-mile Atlantic crossing that he
decided to set up his own company on the Clyde to provide Scots sailors
with professional advice and practical assistance.
Minerva Rigging, based at Kip Marina just south of Gourock, now
employs five full-time staff and is the Scottish agent for Kemp, one of
Europe's leading yacht spar and mast manufacturers.
The comprehensive rigging service provided by Minerva works is the
product of an association with a sail-making operation on site at
Inverkip.
Mr Percy, 39, who is also managing director of Glasgow-based Minerva
Medical plc -- it conducts clinical research in association with Glasgow
Royal Infirmary and Glasgow University -- says he set up the business
out of sheer frustration.
He said: ''I became increasingly concerned, getting nothing but bad
advice and lengthy delays in having basic work done on my yacht, a
Bavaria 390, in preparation for a lengthy voyage across the Atlantic.
While on the trip I thought on the idea for a professionally run company
sited within Scotland's marine industry.
''As rigging and sailmaking should go hand-in-hand, I consequently
formed an association with Chris Owen of Owen Sails. The opportunity
arose to acquire facilities at Kip Marina on the Clyde and the services
of some excellent people there.''
Classroom seminars on sails and rigging performance will be run by
Chris Owen.
Mr Percy continued: ''I decided that to run this business in the same
way I've been used to with Minerva Medical -- we needed to install
sophisticated business systems. Our accountant and computer programmes
support the rigging company, allowing staff to concentrate on building
and maintaining rigging.
''Staff are now being trained by spar and mast mufacturers Kemp at
their south coast factory to ensure we have all the additional skills to
fully service a growing market. This training alone represents a
substantial investment.''
Significant funding has also been directed towards the purchase of
specialist equipment to swage rigging wire on site. Before this, work
had to be contracted out to companies in England.
He added: ''In the past wire fittings for yachts greater than 42ft in
length had to be sent south for construction. Now we can make these
fittings locally, keeping jobs here and substantially reduce turnaround
times. This is expensive machinery and its purchase represents our
long-term commitment.''
Yachts based on the Clyde can use the services of Minerva Rigging at
Kip but those based further afield on the east and west coasts can be
serviced through a mobile rigging facility operated by the company.
Minerva plans to have two yachts rigged for demonstration to allow
customers to see the systems in operation at the Kip marina.
''We plan to conduct classroom seminars and on-water demonstration for
customers using Minerva's fleet of Cork 1720 one design sports boats and
the new Bavaria 44 cruiser. We shall be targeting both the racing
community and the general cruising market,'' added Mr Percy.
Further expansion plans will see the formation of another new company,
Minerva Leisure, which will concentrate on providing yachts for
corporate client hospitality charter accompanied by experienced
skippers. The boats will all be sponsored by local businesses.
This venture is being overseen by Joe English, the Irish Whitbread and
Admirals Cup skipper of the Maxi yacht ''NCB Ireland'' who has 20-years
of offshore racing experience. Five full-time jobs will be created over
the next 12 months.
A further leisure opportunity is being pursued by Minerva at the
nearby 9000 acre Ardgowan Estate at Inverkip.
''In conjunction with Kip Marina and with the support of its director,
Martin Latimer, our operation will be extended to include an off-road
driving school, clay-pigeon shooting, fishing, riding and archery, all
of which should be complete by Easter,'' added Mr Percy.

A Scot who has won #200,000 worth of prizes in competitions is
launching a new career advising on competitions.
IN the last 20 years a Scottish housewife has won goods, holidays,
equipment and cash prizes to the value of more than #200,000. And luck
has nothing to do with it she says. Winning competitions is a skill and
an art which can be learned. Kathy Kantypowicz is proof of her
assertion.
Now she has embarked on a career to pass on her experience and skills
to avid entrants.
She has been appointed editor of a new monthly magazine aimed at the
millions of people who try promotional or easy-to-enter competitons as a
major interest in their lives.
''Millions do it,'' she says. ''And there is a hard core of 1000 or so
who win a lot of prizes every week.''
Kathy Kantypowicz is too modest to claim she is Britain's top
competition winner but she must be close to it.
As she spoke she was packing and on the brink of a move from her home
in Leven to Stamford, Lincolnshire, to take up her new post as the
editor of Competitors World.
It is the latest and the most major step in the life of the
45-year-old mother who began doing competitions to offset boredom after
the birth of her son, David, who is now a regular soldier in the
R.E.M.E.
It all began with a cake-mix promotional advertisement remembers
Kathy.
She entered and promptly forgot all about it until Christmas Eve in
1975 when a delivery van drew up at her door and delivered the prize --
a complete set of power tools worth, at that time, a large sum of money.
''I never believed that anyone ever won these kinds of contests,'' she
says.
Kathy quickly became addicted. And she won . . . and won again and
again.
It took over almost her entire social life -- up to 10 hours a day.
''Since I began my total prizes work out at more than #l0,000 a
year,'' she adds.
There is no false modesty about the lady and there is no doubt in her
mind that she will go on winning.
Among her prizes have been two holidays in America with her husband,
John, and David, a Concorde flight to Egypt, a caravan, televisions,
computers, hi-fi sets, a years' supply of tights, furniture,
video-cassette recorders, a whole range of goods and services too
numerous to list. The roll-call of her successes runs into thousands.
''I do it for the excitement of winning,'' she smiles.
''Obviously we keep the top and most attractive prizes like the
holidays and the caravan but I give a lot away to charity.''
The one prize which has eluded her is a car. She has been trying all
of her career for that ultimate success, the last grail in her crusade
to win as much as possible.
''But I will get it yet,'' she vows.
Kathy Kantypowicz has not been selfish or secretive with her skills in
her search for the freebies.
A few years ago the local authority in her home area persuaded her to
launch a course of evening classes in how to win competitions. It was
the first time in Britain such a course had been taught.
''I believe there are quite a few now up and down the country,'' Kathy
says.
Statistically, and she can prove it, 95% of Kathy's students were
successful in winning some kind of prize.
Much to her chagrin, one former student even achieved Kathy's ambition
and won a car recently.
So how is it done?
In its simplest terms Kathy explains: ''The first thing is to believe
you can do it because if you aren't in it you can't win it.''
Study the competition carefully. Do research to get the answers right.
If you don't have your own reference books use the local library. Most
entries ask the competitor to write a slogan or set out in so many words
what attracts them to the product.
''Work out what the promoter is aiming at. Study slogans that have won
previously. Get a good dictionary and work at it.'' she says.
''People love these kinds of competition because they are better
educated, they like a challenge, and there is a lot more leisure time to
fill nowadays.''
It is not as simple or easy hobby. Kathy has packed more than 300
reference books while preparing her move south for the new job. And
there is the knack to be learned.
Kathy's function at the new magazine will be to advise her readers how
to set out on the trail of the prizes. She will run lists of up-coming
and current promotions offering big prizes. And there will be advice and
guidance through the maze of conditions and pitfalls.
''It needn't be an expensive hobby,'' she adds. ''Sometimes it just
means changing your brand at the supermarket so you can send in the
right label, and then it is just postage.''
One of Kathy's most trenchant pieces of advice is to avoid the
telehone competitions where entrants have to call an 0891 number.
''Mostly they are a rip-off,'' she says. Some entail listening to a
five minute ''spiel'' before you can speak and then it takes several
more minutes at a heavy call tariff to get your entry into their tape.
''I have heard of one where the prize was #1000 cash but the calls
cost #5. The company running it made more than #2m and it cost them just
#1000 to the winner and the hire of the line,'' she adds.
Kathy hopes her magazine, which will become part of the stable of
special interest publications owned by Key Publishing in Stamford, will
fill a gap in the market.
Launch date is May 11th and the #1.50 publication will employ a
research staff of 10 competition experts, among them her husband, John,
and a design team as well as high-profile contributors.

DOUGIE Freedman last night sent a thank-you message to former England
international keeper Ray Clemence, his team manager at Barnet.
The 20-year-old striker from Glasgow's Milton housing scheme, who
scored the Scotland Under-21s' winner against Russia on Tuesday night,
says that Clemence rescued his career.
He admitted: ''I was going nowhere in the Queen's Park Rangers reserve
side when Ray Clemence came to watch one of our games. Rangers let me go
when he wanted to sign me, and since then he has been a tremendous
influence.
''It's down to him that I'm playing for Scotland's Under-21 team. He
pushed my claims.''
Freedman went to school in Bishopbriggs, played for Lenzie Youth Club,
and then, at 16, moved south to QPR, then joined Barnet.
He added: ''QPR did not give me a free transfer -- they just allowed
me to go, and I think there is a clause in their agreement with Barnet
that they will pick up 40% of any transfer fee Barnet might get for me.
''I've scored 23 goals this season but, honestly, if anyone had told
me I would be playing for Scotland against Russia I would have laughed
at them. That just didn't seem possible.
''I think the fact that Clemence phoned Craig Brown helped, and, of
course, scoring goals hasn't hurt, either. The goal against Russia was
one of the easiest I've scored, thanks to Stevie Crawford. He set it up
for me.
''I've managed to get a good understanding with Stevie. We haven't had
much time to work together in training, but somehow on the field things
have paid off.''
Freedman's goal, his first for his country, has Scotland sitting in a
strong position in the qualifying group. He says: ''I think it's
possible that we can reach the quarter-finals now.
''I thought we deserved to win against Russia, even though few people
would have given us a chance before the game.
''There's a great spirit in the team and Tommy Craig, the coach, keeps
preaching to us that that is where our strength lies. I think he's
right.''
Craig has now guided his team to three straight victories after a
disappointing start to the campaign, when they lost in Finland. If they
continue in this groove, then they will make the tournament's last
eight.

Moscow,
SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown insisted last night: ''We are on course
for the European Championship Finals.'' Brown had watched his team draw
in Moscow, a vital result in their quest for a place in the finals in
England next year.
And afterwards he said: ''This is what we wanted. This is the result
we came for -- we always thought that we could get at least a point.
''This is one of the most important results we have had since I took
over. It was a performance I am proud of, a performance which showed
just how much the team spirit prevails.
''It has always been in my mind that we can qualify. It has always
been in my mind that we can do so because of the way the games lie.
''We have been happy because we know that there are home games to
come.''
It was a view supported by the Russian manager, Oleg Romantsev, who
said: ''Our problem has always been we cannot match the Scottish team
spirit. And we know, especially now, that their fixtures in Glasgow will
become so important.
''We look at that and we feel that Scotland will qualify but we hope
that we will be with them.
''The Greeks have still to go away from home for their important
matches. They are different players outside of their own country. We
believe that Scotland and Russia will go through.''
''We did not do enough. Some of my players did not respond to the call
of our country. There was not a reponse from some of them which was
required.''
Brown, of course, was delighted with the result. ''What we have to do
now is keep our feet on the ground. I think that the team performance
was special.
''We can qualify for the finals and I still think that Russia will be
with us.
''But the main thing now is to continue our progress. I have always
thought that Russia would be our main rivals.
''We have finished level with them -- now, if we beat Greece at home
we can go to England. There is a mood of quiet satisfaction in the
dressing-room, the players are happy that they have shown what they can
do.
''We will not be carried away by this result. We will not be carried
away by our situation in the group. We will continue to work, and work
hard and prove ourselves. That is what this squad is all about.''

WITH its #1300m refinancing at last agreed, Queens Moat Houses is
laying the groundwork for a trading recovery, though it made further
heavy losses in 1994.
The total deficit came to #95.2m but the bulk of this arose from the
sheer length of time it took to complete the refinancing with the 74
banks involved. Had the agreement been in force for 1994 the loss would
have been cut to #30.2m.
The most serious consequence of the delay was that the group was
unable to hedge against currency movements, with the result that there
has been a currency loss of #35m over the past 15 months.
A new valuation of the hotels portfolio has confirmed their value has
been maintained, with the #934m figure representing #36m more than the
previous valuation. Had the financial restructuring been completed on
January 1, net liabilities would have been reduced from #449m to #184m.
This year Queens Moat is concentrating on strengthening its sales and
marketing organisation in the UK and Holland and re-establishing the
Moat House brand here. A national advertising campaign starts next
month.
Chairman Stanley Metcalfe points out that higher interest rates and
uncertain economic recovery will affect growth, though trading so far
has been satisfactory.
The UK hotels achieved operating profits of #33.7m, up from #18.5m,
with occupancy rising from 57.6% to 63% as room rates were held down. A
dozen units were sold and like-for-like sales at the 87 remaining were
5% ahead. Costs were reduced, helped by centralising liquor and other
purchasing.
Germany made little progress, achieving break-even again as room rates
fell more than 5% and new hotels were opened. Major management and
organisational changes were carried out in the year in the business,
which includes 25 Queens hotels and 11 Holiday Inns, making the group
one of the country's larger operators. The 22 hotels in Holland achieved
higher profits of #9.4m.
Queens Moat chief executive Andrew Coppel said the business had been
transformed from a decentralised operation into a customer-focused
profits-driven company, where the emphasis was on strong financial
controls and a team philosophy. Trading in the shares is expected to
resume towards the end of May.

AMERICAN Preference shareholders of jewellery chain Signet have
succeeded in forcing an extraordinary shareholder meeting to consider
breaking the company up and selling it off, it emerged yesterday.
The dissatisfied shareholders have become concerned at the slide in
the group's share price over recent months. The meeting has to be held
by mid-May.
Signet, formerly known as Ratners, is the UK's biggest jewellery chain
and includes H Samuel and Ernest Jones.
The group is weighed down by debts totalling #360m, much of which
matures in June but a break-up of Signet would release considerable
value.
Julien Tregar, who advises UK Active Value Fund, the biggest holder of
another class of Preference shares and which is owed #50m, including
dividend arrears, said recently: ''The time has come for some action to
stop the relentless fall in shareholder value.''
Leicester-based Goldsmiths earlier this week confirmed it was
considering bidding for parts of Signet. ''Under the right
circumstances, and if appropriate funding arrangements were in place,
Goldsmiths would give serious consideration to acquiring parts of
Signet's UK jewellery business but it is not currently in negotiations
with Signet.''
The resolutions at the extraordinary meeting will ask the company to
identify potential bidders as well as illicit offers for the various
businesses and look at other ways of disposing of the divisions
including the possibility of floating them off.
The directors are also asked to convene another meeting several months
later to tell shareholders of the best offers and proposals for selling
the businesses.
Signet said later that its board was considering the requisition with
its advisers and will issue to shareholders a circular containing a
notice of meeting and the board's views on the proposed resolution. ''In
the meantime, shareholders are advised to take no action.''

A ''SMART'' computer system being pioneered at the Irvine mill of
Caledonian Paper offers potential savings of thousands of pounds worth
of lost production time.
The system known as case-based reasoning, or CBR, offers engineers the
chance to diagnose and repair faults faster than before and can also
predict possible problems in the manufacturing process.
CBR has been developed at Yale University over the last 10 years and
is now making the transition from the computer laboratory to the shop
floor.
Caledonian Paper, the UK's sole manufacturer of lighweight-coated
paper for magazine and brochure publishing, has installed one of the
first CBR systems in Scotland and it is already paying dividends.
Mr Jack Lord, engineering director at the Ayrshire plant, said: ''If
we lose a day's production it can cost the company in excess of #100,000
so it is essential that down time is kept to a minimum.
''In the past, a problem may have occurred that one engineer knew
about but he was not around and a colleague may not have been so
familiar with that problem. That led to potentially costly delays in
diagnosing and repairing faults.
''Now the information is fed into the computer and stores it in a
library of thousands of other cases. Just as humans tend to solve
problems by drawing on past experiences, CBR works by adapting solutions
that were used to solve old problems.
''The user presents the new problem to the computer and it will come
up with the closest similar cases and, coupled with the knowledge of the
engineer, can adapt it to the current circumstances.''
Jack Lord is pleased with the new dimension offered by this form of
artificial intelligence but dismisses concerns that systems like it will
eventually replace humans.
''I believe that it enhances, rather than supplants, knowledge. It is
a support, not a substitute, for human experience and I cannot see it
displacing individuals.''
Caledonian Paper, part of the Kymmene Group of Finland, started
production in April 1989 and at the time was Scotland's largest inward
investment at #220m.
There are now 430 people employed at the plant and local management
are hopeful that a second production line can be added on ground already
prepared for the purpose with the creation of over 200 jobs.
Last week the company handed over its millionth tonne of paper several
months ahead of schedule.
At current production levels the Irvine site produces around 600
tonnes of paper a day, turns over #100m a year with an expected profit
this year for the first time, and exports to the rest of Europe, the USA
and Asia.
The key raw material in the paper-making process is Scottish sitka
spruce. Every year over 200,000 tonnes of timber logs from Scotland's
forests are used with two trees planted for every one cut down to
provide a renewable and sustainable supply of wood.

SCOTLAND has been the focus of considerable activity in the
supermarket retailing sector in recent months with Tesco's purchase of
Dundee-based William Low's and Kwiksave's buy-out of the troubled
Shoprite group.
The trend toward a concentration of sales among the big four
supermarket chains -- Sainsbury, Safeway, Tesco and Asda -- has been
continuing apace for the last couple of decades, although the rate has
slowed considerably since the late seventies and early eighties.
Now, however, there are signs that the independent shopkeeper is
fighting back. The market share of the independent retailer has fallen
from 27% in 1981 to around 12% by 1992 with the multiples increasing
their share from 54% to 75% over the same period. Total turnover during
this period has risen from #1725m in 1981 to #4309m in 1992.
Consumers currently buy around 85% of their goods from supermarkets
but the corner shop is keeping hold of their customers by improving the
professionalism of their service and by combining their efforts. In
Paisley recently a group of independent retailers combined to reduce
prices and advertise their services to compete with a new supermarket
development at nearby Braehead.
Another development has arisen with the Shopwise retail group,
representing around 40 shopkeepers, which was started last year to help
with finance, refurbishment improvements, and increased discounts, from
wholesalers for the independent retailer.
Mr Lawrie Dewar, chief executive of the Scottish Grocers Federation,
believes that the local independent retailer has a future but only by
adopting a more professional approach: ''We now have a situation where
an ever increasing square footage of retail space is competing for the
same level of expenditure. Food inflation is negligible so more and more
space is competing for the same amount of money. This has made our
450-500 members adopt a more professional approach. We encourage them to
invest in their stores, in products and in refurbishment.''
The supermarkets are no longer just competing on price but are
increasingly selling the ideas of service and quality.
Equally there has been a growth in specialist quality independent
retailers who don't see price as the sole focus for competition.
The Q Guild was established in 1986 to promote the top 1% of
independent retail butchers. With just 30 members in Scotland, out of a
total of 140 throughout the UK, their message is that ''you can
certainly buy cheaper goods elsewhere but you are unlikely to be able to
buy better. Based on the Dutch model of the K butchers, Guild members
have their products and facilities regularly, and randomly, inspected by
the Meat and Livestock Commission to a higher specification than normal
retail butchers'', according to Q Guild spokesman Ross Muir.
The Q Guild believe that this is the way forward in competing with the
supermarkets as immediate past chairman and Dundonian butcher, David
Craig, explained: ''We offer a guarantee of standards. We believe that
isof concern to our customers and therefore must be of concern to the Q
butcher.''
But there are some who are more gloomy about the future. Alex Smith
owns the prestigious game dealer and butchers shop, George Bower and
Sons, in Edinburgh's Raeburn Place. His shop, within a few hundred yards
of an enormous Safeway supermarket, has a regular clientele but George
believes that even this will not be enough to keep his shop going when
his daughters take over following his retirement in five years time.
''There'll be no shops here in the future. Everybody has cars now and
the supermarkets cater for people with vehicles. At the same time that
the councils are agreeing to massive car parks beside new supermarkets
they are restricting the parking facilities for customers outside local
shops. They are also increasing the level of rates which will force most
of the small shops out of business,'' he said.
These views are echoed by Lawrie Dewar: ''Local authorities have to
play their part and give as much support to the local independent
retailer as they do to the supermarket chains. Instead of putting yellow
lines outside the doors of shops they should be helping develop
neighbourhood shopping.''

THE former head of accounts at Glasgow stockbroker Allied Provincial
Securities has been expelled by the industry regulator, after making
fictitious accounting entries to hide unexplained shortfalls in petty
cash.
In a statement released yesterday, the London-based Securities and
Futures Authority said George Dickson had admitted making the false
entries and accepted that such conduct meant he was no longer fit and
proper for registration with the SFA.
An Allied Provincial spokeswoman stressed that Mr Dickson, who was
dismissed in November 1993, did not handle client money.
He was registered as a manager with the SFA and, as such, was not
qualified to give investment advice.
She added that it was purely an internal matter and that Mr Dickson
had been responsible for handling company money.

TWO outmoded industrial and retail estates in the west of Scotland are
being given a new lease of life as modern retail parks, writes STEWART
McINTNOSH.
As a result, Uddingston's rejuvenated Birkenshaw Industrial Estate has
been sold to Boots Properties plc in a #2.2m deal.
The vendor was building firm Taylor Woodrow and the #2,223,000 sale
completes a remarkable turn around for the 2.5 acre site which has been
transformed from industrial warehousing into a 21,000 sq ft retail
location.
Two successful planning appeals to the Secretary of State for Scotland
allowed change of use from industrial, paving the way for the
construction of new retail units and the eventual sale of the
development.
David Tough, planning associate in Ryden's Edinburgh office who
conducted one of the appeals, said: ''The planning appeals and the
construction of new retail units have revitalised the estate and helped
to secure a very good sale for Taylor Woodrow. Birkenshaw has been
transformed from an industrial estate into a flourishing new retail
location.''
Sterling Warehouses now occupies a 13,500 sq ft unit at an annual rent
of #114,623 and FADS is the tenants of a 7500 sq ft unit at an annual
rent of #63,750.
Boots' purchase of the 21,000 sq ft development equates to a net
initial yield of 7.75%. Boots was represented by Hartley Cowley &amp; Co.
Meanwhile, Sydney &amp; London Properties Limited has been granted
planning consent for re-development of a 15-acre trading estate
developed in the 1960s adjacent to Glasgow airport.
The scheme includes what is thought to be the first ''out of town''
DIY retail store in Scotland. The consent permits redevelopment to
provide 140,000 sq ft gross retail floor space, restricted to the sale
of DIY, furniture, carpets, electrical and gardening goods.
''This is a well-recognised and well-frequented estate but is tired
and in need of re-development to provide suitable facilities for the
residents of Paisley,'' says Richard Anning of Sydney &amp; London.

SCOTLAND'S supply of good quality office space is dwindling fast,
bringing new opportunities for speculative developers and creating the
prospects of rental increases after five years in the doldrums.
The increase in rentals will start slowly this year but should
accelerate from 1996 onwards, predicts a survey on Scotland's office
investment market by property consultants Ryden.
These findings are backed up by a report from surveyors Richard Ellis,
which says that the dwindling supply of quality space in Glasgow offers
an opportunity for developers.
The Ryden report says that Glasgow and Edinburgh rents have bottomed
out from their peaks around 1990-91 and there are good medium-term
prospects for rents bouncing back beyond their previous high points.
Such a recovery would put Edinburgh rentals back into the #25/#26 per sq
ft bracket, while Glasgow's would again reach their high-tide mark of
just over the #20 per sq ft achieved at the peak of the boom.
Ryden says that the rental increases will be driven by the limited
supply of Grade A buildings and an improving level of tenant demand.
''Average rental growth in Scotland over the past eight years has been
superior to that in the south, and these factors would suggest lower
yields would be appropriate north of the border,'' says the report.
During the recession office rentals fell further than those in retail
or industrial properties, so the potential for recovery is stronger.
Rental increases in London could make Scottish offices more attractive
to relocaters as the costs gap between London and Scotland widens.
The report concludes that if the Government manages to keep inflation
low, ''there are good prospects for office investments to register
significant real returns''.
These conclusions are reinforced by surveyors Richard Ellis. The
company maintain that Glasgow is now facing a shortage of quality office
space. The total amount of space available on the city's market fell by
26% last year, leaving some 1.5 million sq ft available. But with the
recent letting of the Grosvenor building on Gordon Street to Scottish
Amicable, less than 200,000 sq ft of this space could be considered as
Grade A. ''Availability of top-quality offices will continue to fall
sharply, while at the same time the healthy demand for this type of
space will put upward pressure on prime rents, which is encouraging news
for developers,'' says Craig Ritchie of Richard Ellis.
Approximately 132,500 sq ft of new space is under construction in the
city centre, not all of which will be completed during 1995. ''The new
supply is unlikely to meet expected demand, which would suggest overall
stronger competition and possible signs of rental growth towards the end
of the year,'' says Craig Ritchie.
Prime rents in Glasgow stand at around #17 per sq ft, although the
paucity of recent deals means that this level is difficult to prove in
the market.

Mathew Spicer discovers a university department which has turned to
industry for the bulk of its funding, and the excellent reputation it
now enjoys
FUNDING is not a problem where you have excellence, maintains Tim
Miller, Lucas Professor of Electronics and Electrical Engineering at
Glasgow University, with the confidence of a man who has both in
enviable quantity. ''This department has research excellence in a number
of spheres -- world class, international level -- and I don't think
you'll find anyone whining about lack of funds.''
Miller's ambition is to run a University Research and Development
laboratory fully responsive to industry and funded directly by industry,
with next to no Government support. He is already more than halfway
there, thanks to the success and reputation of his SPEED Consortium
(Scottish Power Electronics and Electric Drives), an international group
of companies supporting a wide range of research and development (R &amp; D)
projects in the Power Electronics Laboratory.
Professor Miller, a Glasgow graduate with considerable industrial
experience, set up SPEED when he returned to the University in 1986
after working in the United States with General Electric. He brought
with him a clutch of American contacts, some of whom signed up to become
SPEED's first members when they heard of its formation.
American industry is familiar and comfortable with this kind of
association and 70% of SPEED's business is still with American
companies. Japan takes up a further 15%, with the remaining 15% divided
between Europe and the UK.
Membership of the consortium costs an annual subscription of #5000,
with new members paying an initial fee of #10,000 in order to safeguard
the investment of existing members who have -- after all -- funded the
current level of knowledge and expertise. And once in SPEED, companies
tend to stay.
The core service provided by SPEED to its member companies is
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for a spectrum of electric motors,
from those used in washing machines to the generation of aircraft power.
This software is in daily use and each day brings faxes and phone calls
to the laboratory asking for clarification or assistance.
When that assistance means practical work on design, it represents
SPEED's second service to its customers -- consultancy or, as Tim Miller
prefers to call it, fire-fighting. Consultancy is free to members and,
to protect the intellectual property and commercial confidentiality of
subscribers, no consultancy work is undertaken outwith the consortium.
The third and major area of the laboratory's work, for which the
companies do pay, is the design and construction of prototype hardware
under contract -- motors, electronic controllers, test equipment and
development kits. Basically a tin box that design engineers can plug
their equipment into, the kit speeds up the development time of new
products and has sold widely in the United States and Japan in
particular.
This design work is not undertaken for profit but to keep the
laboratory's electronic engineers, some of the best in the world, at the
cutting edge of development. Each new kit is more advanced that the
last, using the latest micro-electronic technology.
SPEED's turnover, at about #200,000 a year, is not huge. Tim Miller
regards the quality of the output and the number of talented people
employed -- currently about 15 and most of them local -- as the real
profit, the true measure of the style and significance of the operation.
In any scientific frontier territory, where intellectual property and
commercial confidence are involved, a relationship of absolute trust is
vital and SPEED has worked hard to be immediately responsive to its
customers' needs and scrupulously responsible with its customers'
secrets. As most businessmen will understand, that trust took longer to
develop with the Japanese than with the Americans, but develop it did.
Personal contact is vital. A group or individual from one or other
consortium company is in the laboratory most weeks; someone from the
laboratory -- usually Professor Miller -- will visit each company at
least once a year.
Last year, the laboratory logged 55 technical enquiries, ranging from
simple problems that could be solved in a morning to major design
crises. Just one of these, a recent request for help from the Danish
engineers DANFOSS, illustrates the service SPEED can provide for
manufacturing industry.
DANFOSS had a problem calculating inductance in a new motor for a
refrigerator designed for caravans -- a calculation vital to its
cost-effectiveness. In Glasgow, the problem was solved, the inductance
calculated and the design improved. A design task of six weeks was
completed in just one, utilising the resources of the SPEED team.
Professor Miller does not claim that his engineers are necessarily
better than those employed by SPEED's member companies, but they do
offer a very special and complimentary service. ''It's the skill of
solving new problems that's our speciality.''
Few British firms avail themselves of this service, partly because
they are unfamiliar with the concept of the consortium and partly
because they want to be assured of commercial results before investing.
Perhaps more fundamentally, the British manufacturing base has so
declined that this level of research and development is decidedly
scarce. LUCAS, who sponsor Miller's professorship, are a notable
exception.
Tim Miller thinks the Government misunderstands the function of
universities in relation to industry. ''It has a perception that the way
to get good co-operation between industry and universities is to take
the technology which is boiling up in the universities and transfer it
onto the factory floor. In many cases technological advancement is far
further ahead on the factory floor than it is back in the university.
Technology is somewhere other than where they think it is.
''Government needs to look afresh at what's going on in British
universities. When they do, for their next funding review, they will see
''a lot of enterprising activity that's not accounted for in their
bean-counting, brownie-points system,'' he said.

PEARSON is buying Grundy Worldwide, the Australian producer of the
Neighbours television soap opera in what is TV mogul Greg Dyke's first
deal for the group since he joined at the beginning of the year.
The rapidly developing media group is paying #175m cash for Grundy
which also makes game shows and drama series.
Mr Dyke personally made some #7m from Granada's takeover of LWT last
year but instead of retiring on the proceeds he became head of Pearson
Television, which currently consists mainly of Thames Television, now
just a progamme maker. His recruitment was quite a coup for Pearson.
The deal is just the ticket for fulfilling Pearson's goal of becoming
a global force in television. Grundy gives it worldwide programme sales
and production bases in 14 countries. But it is in the Asian market that
Mr Dyke thinks Grundy has the best prospects.
There is clear scope for a link with TVB, a Hong Kong broadcaster in
which the group is linked via a 10% holding. Pearson also has a joint TV
venture with the Hindustan Times of India.
''Grundy is an expert in low-cost programming and that's just what we
want for these emerging markets,'' said Mr Dyke.
The deal comes about because the Australian company's 71-year old
founder wants to realise his investment. He was otherwise going to float
the company, which concentrates on down-market programmes like ''Sale of
the Century'' and ''Wheel of Fortune'' as well as Neighbours.
''Grundy has a legendary reputation for the efficient financial
management of its productions in different markets around the world and
I see the acquisition as a vital ingredient in both our expansion and
our positioning,'' said Mr Dyke.
Some of Grundy's UK productions could now be made at Thames studios.
The purchase is expected to be earnings positive from year one.
However, Pearson shares reacted negatively, dipping 10p to 553p,
though they are still sensitive following results earlier this week.
* PRE-PRESS and printing services company Wace Group has agreed to
sell its German and Italian imaging businesses for a total of #9.3m.

New Orleans,
THIS week, the week before the US Masters, the New Orleans Classic is
often used as a period of strategy, both for those who compete here and
those who choose not to.
Greg Norman never could make up his mind, playing English Turn GC
every other year or so, finishing second each time and heading to
Augusta raving about how perfect this course is as a warm-up for the
Masters and full of confidence that this would be his green jacket year.
Of course, it never was.
So then he would try skipping this tournament, going fishing,
relaxing, practicing or heading to Augusta early, but so far those plans
haven't produced any green sportswear either.
As Norman left the Players' Championship last Sunday mumbling about
how tired he was and how he just did not feel like playing golf anymore,
having just finished at six over par, 30 strokes higher than his total
the previous year, his absence is not surprising.
Many other top players skip New Orleans because they have just played
four straight weeks on the rich and high quality Florida swing,
including Nick Faldo, Colin Montgomerie, Seve Ballesteros and Bernhard
Langer.
In the past the tournament has been full of Europeans prepping for the
Masters, but because so many started in America earlier than in previous
years, the only players using the event as a final preparation for
Augusta are Jose Maria Olazabal, Ian Woosnam and Sandy Lyle.
The two other Europeans in the field, David Feherty and Jesper
Parnevik, are trying to snag the last invitation availaible for the
Masters.
Usually this is a good practice week for the Masters. English Turn is
a tough Jack Nicklaus design, and the greens are undulating and very
fast. Woosnam won here in 1991 before he won the Masters, and Olazabal
was second here to Ben Crenshaw last year, the week before his first
major success.
Unfortunately, unless a deluge hits Augusta next week, these greens
may not help the players hone their putting to Masters level. Strong
rain storms cancelled yesterday's pro-am before a ball had been struck,
and the prediction was for continued rain through Friday.

FORMER maths teacher John Morgan plans to stay top of the class when
the 1995 PGA European Seniors Tour starts today with the Windsor Senior
Masters, in Nairobi, Kenya.
Morgan, 51, who turned professional 26 years ago, earns more now than
he did on the main European circuit. In 1986, when he won the Jersey
Open, he earned #39,000 -- yet he amassed #60,000 last year when he
topped the seniors' order of merit.
That No.1 spot brings extra rewards, like invitations to major
overseas events, including the US PGA Seniors Championship in Florida in
two weeks' time. Joining him there will be ex-Ryder Cup players Malcolm
Gregson, Tommy Horton, and Spain's Antonio Garrido, all playing also in
this week's 54-hole event at the luxury Windsor Golf and Country Club.
Brian Huggett, the 58-year-old former Ryder Cup captain, has won more
money -- #117,000 -- since he joined the Seniors Tour three years ago
than he did from 19 wins in 20 years on the European Tour.
Former Ryder Cup man and PGA Cup captain George Will and Dumfries and
Country professional Gordon Gray are the Scots among the 44 contesting
the #55,000 three-day event.
* GRAHAM Lowson (Crieff), a former Scottish amateur champion, and
Scott Knowles (Kingsknowe), a fellow internationalist, have come into
the field for the Champion of Champions tournament, to be played on
April 8 and 9 at Leven Links. They replace James Paterson (Eyeymouth)
and John McLean (Bathgate), the Scottish seniors champion.

VITO Crolla has become used to serving stars in the restaurants that
he has owned. Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Redford, Peter Ustinov and Sean
Connery have all enjoyed food from his kitchens.
The beaming smile with which he greets his customers in his latest
restaurant venture La Dolce Vito in Edinburgh is wider than usual as
Vito has become something of a celebrity himself.
Vito is featured in Quintin Jardine's newly published crime novel
Skinner's Trail as Mr V, the owner of a an Edinburgh restaurant bearing
the same name.
Vito gave up Mr V's restaurant last year to open up La Dolce Vito, and
he was delighted when author and PR consultant Quintin Jardine informed
him that when the paperback edition of his book is published the author
will update his book and place Mr V in La Dolce Vito.
The Italian restaurateur has been in the restaurant business since
opening his first concern in 1972.
Speaking of the stars he has served while in the business Vito, spoke
most fondly of Grace Kelly saying: ''What a women she was. I had the
pleasure of serving her several times, and she was very pleasant. She
would always order minestrone soup and a lager.''
Vito sought warmer climes in 1983 when he moved to Florida and opened
up a restaurant but could not settle, and returned to Edinburgh the
following year.
He opened Mr V's in Charlotte Lane in 1988 before deciding to move to
the larger premises in Hanover Street and open La Dolce Vito.
''My new place is three times the size of my former premises, and will
allow me to do more. In the downstair area I plan to open a bistro
coffee bar but I am not certain what I will call it. But after the book,
perhaps I will name it Mr V's coffee bar.''

MIKE EARREY is busy developing two property sites but that does not
stop him pursuing his other love -- bagging Munros.
Mike's Roselink Developments is building 21 flats in a #1.3m
development overlooking the Water of Leith in Edinburgh and has just
started another project in South Queensferry that will contain 18 flats,
but he still finds time to disappear into the hills.
''We are looking for other sites in Edinburgh and Glasgow but I try to
make sure that at least one Sunday every month I get away to relax,''
says Mike Earrey.
To date Mike has climbed 212 of Scotland's 279 Munros, which for the
uninitiated are peaks of more than 3000ft.
Not content with merely walking up the mountains, Mike and his friends
from time to time take mountain bikes with them. ''I have been mountain
biking for 11 years, and I've taken my bike up half a dozen Munros,
including Ben Nevis and Ben Lomond,'' he says. ''In the case of Ben
Nevis I carried the bike up but cycled down the entire mountain.''
Other walking routes to fall under the tread of Mike's mountain bike
include the Devil's Staircase at Glencoe and the West Highland Way.
''Since I took up this pastime concentrating on the Pentland Hills,'' he
says, ''I've pioneered many routes along old droving tracks''.
Refreshed from his exercise Mike is concentrating on building up his
business. In his 30 years in the house-building business Mike has seen
many ups and downs but he plans to develop Roselink to a stage where it
is building around 100 units a year.
The company uses the timber-frame building process, which is
relatively unusual and requires high quality workmanship. ''The units
are built in a factory to precise measurements, and if you don't prepare
the foundations to the correct size then you are in trouble,'' he
explains.
But the process is quicker, which means that Roselink pays less
interest to the banks on the money it raises to finance its projects.

''Adrian Holmes, chairman of Lowe Howard-Spink, delivered a blistering
attack on the decline in moral standards and the rise of 'new
yobbishness' in advertising.'' -- Marketing Week.
HANDOUT Henry, our consultant guru in a matters promotional, bowled me
a googly last night in McSonachan's. ''Imagine a TV commercial for Nerd
House,'' he said. ''We open with a wide shot of the dealing room.
Everyone frantically barking down the phones. The camera moves in for a
close-up of one dealer, who shouts 'Yes! Bloody yes!' into his phones
and crashes down the handset with such force that it explodes.
''When the smoke clears, we find ourselves in the Back Room where six
identical accountants sit at six identical desks. They tap in unison at
their calculators -- di-di-di-dah, di-di-di-dah -- the opening notes
from Beethoven's Fifth in C minor, also morse code for the V-sign. They
then shout 'Yes! Bloody yes!' and hurl their calculators into the air,
where they explode.
''The smoke clears again and we find ourselves in the Chairman's
office. The Chairman is lighting a fat cigar. He takes a phone call.
'Yes! Bloody yes!' he shouts, slams down the phone and grabs a bottle of
champagne. As the cork comes out there is a great, frothy explosion.
When the froth clears, the camera draws back and we see a representation
of Nerd House with the facade removed. On every floor, people are
drinking champagne and whooping it up, while the sprinkler system rains
down banknotes. Then up come the words: Nerd House . . . Working to Make
You Filthy Rich.
''What d'you think?'' panted Handout Henry, who was out of breath by
this time.
I sipped my pint thoughtfully. I hated to put a damper on the fat
man's creativity. But honesty was called for at a time like this.
''Henry,'' I said, ''that is exactly the sort of yobbish ad Mr Adrian
Holmes of Lowe Howard-Spink was talking about in Monte Carlo. People
crushing matchstick models underfoot, laughing at pensioners, throwing
beer-bottles, using bad language. He pointed out that commercials don't
just sell products but also sell attitudes and behaviour. That
storyboard is crass.''
Henry sighed. ''That's what I told the chairman,'' he said. ''It was
his idea. He wants a mention at Monte Carlo next year. I tried sarcasm.
I suggested that in the final shot we could use a pensioner with a
zimmer being mugged in the street.''
I asked what the boss had said. ''Yes! Bloody yes!'' said Henry
gloomily. Trying to control the hysterics, I called: ''A large G&amp;T over
here, McSonachan.''
* The news that brokers at the Karachi Stock Exchange sacrificed 10
goats to try to halt a run on prices has opened all sorts of
possibilities. What happened, apparently, was that the turnover
immediately rose to record levels, but the 100-share index then
plummeted to its lowest point for 16 months.
I consulted City opinion on this one. City opinion felt that,
obviously, 10 goats wasn't enough. ''I think,'' said City opinion,
''that these brokers hadn't calculated the effect of cost-push on goats,
and the resultant stop-go in the ruminant economy. There was probably an
invisible decay in the sacrifice-quotient of the average goat although
-- who knows? -- the picture could have changed overnight, depending on
goat-confidence or goat-slide.''
Did City opinion think the Karachi brokers had chosen the wrong goats?
''Certainly, gilt-edged or blue chip goats would have been preferable,''
came the reply, ''but it's hard for me to say without seeing them. What
happened to them by the way?''
The meat was given to the poor, I said.
''Good grief!'' expostulated City opinion. ''That's your problem, you
see? These goats were an investment: you can't run an economy like that.
If you hang on a minute, I'll work out how many Karachi goats it takes
to change a light-bulb.'' I put the phone down against the manic
clicking of his keyboard.

THE March winner of the TrailBlazer of the month award is a real David
among the Goliaths: a company competing in a multi-billion pound market
dominated by two or three multinational players yet competing very
successfully.
The company's commitment to being customer-led, along with its ability
to produce new products rapidly in a fraction of the time it would take
the larger players, means it is now one of Scotland's fastest-growing
manufacturing businesses.
Yet this success is a recent development in the history of
Rutherglen-based Sanmex International plc, a family-owned company that
originated in the 1930s as a bulk supplier of janitorial supplies, such
as disinfectant, to Glasgow's cinemas and hospitals.
The change came five years ago when managing director Dr Allan Groden
spotted the emergence and enormous potential of the discount
supermarkets and decided to switch trading emphasis from markets in
long-term decline to supplying own label products to companies such as
Aldi, Netto, and Shoprite.
Sanmex offers an extensive product range divided into two: liquids
such as fabric conditioners, washing-up liquid, and disinfectants, and
aerosols, including air fresheners, polish, fly spray, bathroom mousse,
body sprays, shaving foams, and anti-perspirants.
Its success can be judged by a recent launch of Nix, a bathroom mousse
that sold 100,000 cans in six weeks, and the company's introduction of
apple and peach variants in its Charm washing-up liquid.
After their tremendous success with own labels, soon other discounters
and multiples such as Asda, Tesco, and Sainsbury began visiting
Rutherglen, and Sanmex saw sales doubling between 1990 and 1993. Last
year's turnover of #12m is expected to increase to #14.5m for 1995 and
the company confidently expects to hit the #20m turnover mark within the
next two years and will look at a partial flotation thereafter.
Now, although 80% of its market is domestic, a healthy 20% of sales
are overseas: supplying fly spray to China, ''anything in an aerosol''
to Eastern Europe, even de-static for kaftans to the Middle East!
''We watch trends in product development very closely and continually
look at new lines, for example following the success of the bathroom
mousse a new kitchen variety will follow,'' said sales and marketing
director Norman Ferguson.
Douglas Fairbairn, managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young's Glasgow office,
said: ''What marks this company out is the fact that, having been in the
same business for more than 50 years, it took the brave decision to
examine the marketplace, talk to its customers, then undergo massive
change to go full throttle after the market it really wanted.''
Although confident its site in Dalmarnock Road is capable of handling
the business over the next two years, additional finance will then be
needed to increase the filling lines, provide new warehousing, and move
into new markets. Sanmex is already one of the biggest employers in
Rutherglen, but this will increase its workforce from the current 170 to
more than 200.

KILMARNOCK manager Alex Totten yesterday hit out at the ''joke money''
which clubs are asking when he inquires about a player in his bid to
strengthen his squad before tomorrow night's transfer deadline.
The Rugby Park side travel to meet relegation rivals Aberdeen at
Pittodrie on Saturday and, having lost their past three matches without
managing to score, Totten was hoping to bring in at least one new
player, apart from Billy Findlay, whom he signed from Hibs in part
exchange for defender Andy Millen earlier in the week.
''It's very difficult,'' he said. ''I have been looking all over and I
know the players I would like, but the type of money some clubs are
asking is a joke and we're not prepared to give them it. Since
Manchester United signed Andy Cole for #7m, the market has gone a bit
crazy.
''I'm not saying we won't make a signing before the deadline, but we
are running out of time.''
An added worry for Kilmarnock, who will be going for their fourth win
of the season over the Dons -- they have already won 2-1 and 3-1 at
Rugby Park and 1-0 at Pittodrie -- is that striker Colin McKee is
doubtful.
The former Manchester United youngster missed the Under-21 Scots' win
over Russia in Moscow this week and has a badly swollen ankle.
Killie's veteran midfielder Robert Connor will try to heighten the
crisis surrounding his former club. But if they don't beat the drop, he
reckons the Dons will have only themselves to blame.
Pointing to the recent sacking of manager Willie Miller, he said:
''From what I have seen, there does not appear to be a great atmosphere
within the club.
''My first concern, though, is for Kilmarnock. This is a huge game for
both clubs and another win for us would open up a seven-point gap over
Aberdeen.
''Whatever happens, I do not want to see them relegated. I spent eight
years there and still feel for the club, and the premier division can
ill afford to lose a team of their status.''
Connor, however, admits that his own side have hit a bad patch over
the past month. ''Anyone who says the pressure doesn't affect you in
this situation is talking rubbish,'' he said. ''When you are fighting
for your lives -- and half the league is -- then the fear factor takes
over. This hits young players in particular.''
* NEW Dundee United manager Billy Kirkwood could still be involved in
a last-gasp dash into the transfer market, despite dropping an interest
in the two players he watched as trialists even before his appointment.
Portuguese left-back Mario Olivera and another foreigner turned out as
trialists in a bounce game with St Johnstone -- watched by Kirkwood --
but United won't be making an offer for either player.
After having supervised his first training session, Kirkwood said:
''These players will be leaving.
''No sum of cash has been specified to me as being available, but if I
decide to make a move, I'll ask the board for the go-ahead.''
Kirkwood would not be surprised if other clubs enquire about some of
his new charges, but he appears determined to hang on to big-name stars
like Gordan Petric and Billy McKinlay, who have been the subject of
transfer speculation for months.
The new man in charge at Tannadice also made it clear yesterday that
every player at the club is making a fresh start under his rule.
''Anyone who has been out of the picture has the chance to get back
in,'' he said.

GLASGOW University is, as a campus commentator once put it, 120
different businesses linked by a single central-heating system. These
days that description would be more of a recognition of commercial
realities than a joke about the problems of administration in an
academic environment, writes Matthew Spicer.
The stringency of Government funding, now based on rigorous assessment
of the standard of teaching and the quality of research, has forced the
university to look to business for a substantial part of its income. Its
Industrial and Commercial Development Service, under director Fergus
Neil, was set up in the mid-eighties. Funding from that sector is now
running at #20m -- and rising.
Fergus Neil describes the operation as ''both push and pull''. Not
only has Government funding become tighter, but the research councils
are also increasingly circumscribed. Charities too have little prospect
of an increase in income. Industry, in Neil's words, ''is perhaps the
best bet for an expansion of funding in the short to medium-term''.
One already productive area, which might become even more so, is the
pharmaceutical industry. Glasgow's faculties of medicine and veterinary
medicine have extensive links with pharmaceutical companies and, as
these companies increasingly reconsider the viability of thier own
research and development (R &amp; D) facilities, more partnerships are
likely.
To match the supply push, there is an internal pull. Many academics
are now alive to the possibility of industrial work and see it as a
rational way of moving forward. ''If it was otherwise,'' says Neil ''we
wouldn't be earning #20m a year''.
He points again to veterinary medicine as a model of best practice.
The faculty has managed the difficult balance well. It is a Grade 5
research establishment (the top of the Government's league table) but
it's also probably the most interactive of all the vet schools, even
getting some of its fundamental research supported by industry.
It all helps UK plc, but are the universities the better for it?
Certainly they have restructured to meet the demands of their new
circumstances. They are more efficient and the staff, maintains Fergus
Neil, work very hard these days, under a great deal of pressure.
Neil, an accountant, has been with the university a decade now, after
15 years in business, and accusations about idle academics make him
angry. ''My experience is that there are probably more people in
industry hiding in cushy numbers on twice the salary.''
Neil does have a fear for the future: that long-term ''blue sky''
research, with no immediate or obvious commercial outcome, will be
allowed to wither. That would be dangerous for the universities since
intellectual curiosity is their life blood. It would be fatal for our
society since great discoveries are often arrived at by chance.

THE cash-strapped Georgian energy department asked the inhabitants of
Tbilisi not to use electric heaters during the home country's match
against Germany for fear of overloading the republic's straining
electrical resources, but after Spurs striker Jurgen Klinsmann had hit
Georgia with a first-half 1-2, the plea did not seem to matter any more.
Klinsmann opened the scoring in the Group 7 match after 24 minutes
when he outjumping his marker to head home a Mario Basler corner.
Then right on the interval, he latched on to a pass from debutant
Heiko Herrlich in the penalty area before sliding the ball into the
right-hand corner of the net to silence the 75,000 crowd.
The win -- which maintained Germany's 100% record in the qualifying
group, lifted Germany to joint top of the table with Bulgaria on 12
points.

Republic of Ireland 1, Northern Ireland 1
NORTHERN Ireland proved that hard work pays dividends in football when
they earned a battling draw against the Irish Republic at Lansdowne Road
yesterday.
Bryan Hamilton, the north manager, was delighted with his side's
performance, a display that keeps alive their European Championship
qualifying hopes.
Niall Quinn opened the scoring for the Republic two minutes into the
second half, but 25 minutes later Iain Dowie headed the equaliser.
''I'm very pleased for the players,'' said Hamilton. ''I was hard on
them after the Republic beat us 4-0 in Belfast in November and I was
very hard on them in training this week. We worked hard for our point
and it was a great reward for the players, who have been under pressure
after that Belfast result.
''A defeat here would have put us out of contention but I think we are
still in it.
''Whatever the case, this will help us progress as a learning team and
give us belief that we can again become a top-class squad. It is a
wonderful boost for the people of Northern Ireland.
''The loss of a point won't hurt the Republic too much. They have a
many-talented squad, and Jack (Charlton) and I are good friends. We can
help each other with a few results in this group now and I certainly
hope they qualify.''
Charlton, the Republic's manager, was quite cheerful, despite his side
giving away their first goal -- and first point -- in four qualifying
group matches. ''We took a chance playing the ball across the back when
it wasn't necessary and got punished for it,'' he said.
''Young Gillespie made a great run and Iain Dowie headed a super goal
-- one we would have been proud of at the other end. He deserved it for
all the work he did. We have to accept we can't get everything we want.
We had a great win over the North in Belfast but it was never going to
be that way today.''
The home country dominated but hardly created a chance until two
minutes after the break, when Steve Staunton robbed Darren Patterson and
was brought down. Denis Irwin's free kick sailed across as Andy Townsend
made a decoy run, and Quinn was left unattended to volley into the net
from close range.
It seemed then that the floodgates would open. Instead, Paul McGrath
and Phil Babb appeared to leave a clearance to each other and Keith
Gillespie sped away to provide the perfect cross for an unmarked Dowie
to head home.
There were claims for penalties when first substitute Tony Cascarino,
the former Celtic striker, and then John Sheridan went tumbling in the
area. But Quinn, just four minutes before being replaced by Cascarino,
missed the best chance, heading weakly at keeper Alan Fettis.
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND -- A Kelly, G Kelly, Irwin, Babb, McGrath, Keane,
Townsend, D Kelly, Quinn, Sheridan, Staunton. Substitutes -- Cascarino,
Kenna, Kernaghan, McAteer, Bonner.
NORTHERN IRELAND -- Fettis, Patterson, Worthington, Taggart, McDonald,
Morrow, Gillespie, Magilton, Dowie, Hill, Hughes. Substitutes -- Quinn,
O'Neill, Gray, Horlock, Wood.
Referee -- M van de Ende (Holland).
* GOALS after 11 minutes by Sampdoria winger Attilio Lombardo and
Parma's Gianfranco Zola, who drove in from 20 yards near half-time, gave
Italy a 2-0 victory over Ukraine in their Group 4 qualifier in Kiev.

SCOTLAND'S biggest police force, Strathclyde, which looks after 2.3m
people -- half the country's population -- will have 12 constituent
councils running its joint board instead of one as at present.
The police themselves remain resolutely above the politics of it all,
but acknowledge that they will be forced to make major readjustments.
At a strategic level, they subscribe to the view of Strathclyde region
that many communities, particularly the deprived housing areas,
benefited from the multi-disciplinary approach from all the agencies
being under one umbrella.
The police played a major role in a safe Strathclyde; they had input
into design which helped helped cut crime in schools and other public
buildings -- even in the redesign of housing schemes.
They sat alongside many other agencies to create strategies for
emergency planning, child protection, road safety, and other areas of
joint responsibility. They are working closely with the other major
regional agencies to bring together the education and health package
necessary to back up their planned purge on drug abuse.
It was all working well, but now everything will have to be rethought.
Many of the senior officials who took part will be gone and, with them,
the expertise and contacts built up over years.
As he faces this brave new world, Deputy Chief Constable James
Richardson declares: ''We will still consider sound working
relationships with the elected members as one of our greatest priorities
so that we can maximise the quality of the service delivered to the
public.''
The public, he believes, will see no obvious signs of change in
policing. They will not be closing police stations or shifting officers.
The concentration will remain on policing communities, although there
may have to be adjustments to the geographical boundaries of some police
divisions.
The current 15-division structure does not quite fit the jigsaw of the
12 new councils, but it is not far astray. There may be some
amalgamation.
Mr Richardson said: ''Strathclyde police will remain the same, with
the same objectives determined by public consultation and with its close
links with communities underpinned by strong community policing.
''We have in the past policed demand and need. In that way, we have
been able to discriminate in favour of areas of multiple deprivation
where that commitment has improved the quality of people's lives. That
commitment will remain.
''People should not see the force in terms of their own patch. They
should see it as a successful operation which has proved it is possible
to reduce crime levels and to increase detection rates.
''It has also proved it can design operations to take account of
serious public concerns and of public consultation. Its success has
often been in its size, because there are great economies of scale which
provide the best value for money.''

''Adrian Holmes, chairman of Lowe Howard-Spink, delivered a blistering
attack on the decline in moral standards and the rise of 'new
yobbishness' in advertising.'' -- Marketing Week.
HANDOUT Henry, our consultant guru in a matters promotional, bowled me
a googly last night in McSonachan's. ''Imagine a TV commercial for Nerd
House,'' he said. ''We open with a wide shot of the dealing room.
Everyone frantically barking down the phones. The camera moves in for a
close-up of one dealer, who shouts 'Yes! Bloody yes!' into his phones
and crashes down the handset with such force that it explodes.
''When the smoke clears, we find ourselves in the Back Room where six
identical accountants sit at six identical desks. They tap in unison at
their calculators -- di-di-di-dah, di-di-di-dah -- the opening notes
from Beethoven's Fifth in C minor, also morse code for the V-sign. They
then shout 'Yes! Bloody yes!' and hurl their calculators into the air,
where they explode.
''The smoke clears again and we find ourselves in the Chairman's
office. The Chairman is lighting a fat cigar. He takes a phone call.
'Yes! Bloody yes!' he shouts, slams down the phone and grabs a bottle of
champagne. As the cork comes out there is a great, frothy explosion.
When the froth clears, the camera draws back and we see a representation
of Nerd House with the facade removed. On every floor, people are
drinking champagne and whooping it up, while the sprinkler system rains
down banknotes. Then up come the words: Nerd House . . . Working to Make
You Filthy Rich.
''What d'you think?'' panted Handout Henry, who was out of breath by
this time.
I sipped my pint thoughtfully. I hated to put a damper on the fat
man's creativity. But honesty was called for at a time like this.
''Henry,'' I said, ''that is exactly the sort of yobbish ad Mr Adrian
Holmes of Lowe Howard-Spink was talking about in Monte Carlo. People
crushing matchstick models underfoot, laughing at pensioners, throwing
beer-bottles, using bad language. He pointed out that commercials don't
just sell products but also sell attitudes and behaviour. That
storyboard is crass.''
Henry sighed. ''That's what I told the chairman,'' he said. ''It was
his idea. He wants a mention at Monte Carlo next year. I tried sarcasm.
I suggested that in the final shot we could use a pensioner with a
zimmer being mugged in the street.''
I asked what the boss had said. ''Yes! Bloody yes!'' said Henry
gloomily. Trying to control the hysterics, I called: ''A large G&amp;T over
here, McSonachan.''
* The news that brokers at the Karachi Stock Exchange sacrificed 10
goats to try to halt a run on prices has opened all sorts of
possibilities. What happened, apparently, was that the turnover
immediately rose to record levels, but the 100-share index then
plummeted to its lowest point for 16 months.
I consulted City opinion on this one. City opinion felt that,
obviously, 10 goats wasn't enough. ''I think,'' said City opinion,
''that these brokers hadn't calculated the effect of cost-push on goats,
and the resultant stop-go in the ruminant economy. There was probably an
invisible decay in the sacrifice-quotient of the average goat although
-- who knows? -- the picture could have changed overnight, depending on
goat-confidence or goat-slide.''
Did City opinion think the Karachi brokers had chosen the wrong goats?
''Certainly, gilt-edged or blue chip goats would have been preferable,''
came the reply, ''but it's hard for me to say without seeing them. What
happened to them by the way?''
The meat was given to the poor, I said.
''Good grief!'' expostulated City opinion. ''That's your problem, you
see? These goats were an investment: you can't run an economy like that.
If you hang on a minute, I'll work out how many Karachi goats it takes
to change a light-bulb.'' I put the phone down against the manic
clicking of his keyboard.

MIKE EARREY is busy developing two property sites but that does not
stop him pursuing his other love -- bagging Munros.
Mike's Roselink Developments is building 21 flats in a #1.3m
development overlooking the Water of Leith in Edinburgh and has just
started another project in South Queensferry that will contain 18 flats,
but he still finds time to disappear into the hills.
''We are looking for other sites in Edinburgh and Glasgow but I try to
make sure that at least one Sunday every month I get away to relax,''
says Mike Earrey.
To date Mike has climbed 212 of Scotland's 279 Munros, which for the
uninitiated are peaks of more than 3000ft.
Not content with merely walking up the mountains, Mike and his friends
from time to time take mountain bikes with them. ''I have been mountain
biking for 11 years, and I've taken my bike up half a dozen Munros,
including Ben Nevis and Ben Lomond,'' he says. ''In the case of Ben
Nevis I carried the bike up but cycled down the entire mountain.''
Other walking routes to fall under the tread of Mike's mountain bike
include the Devil's Staircase at Glencoe and the West Highland Way.
''Since I took up this pastime concentrating on the Pentland Hills,'' he
says, ''I've pioneered many routes along old droving tracks''.
Refreshed from his exercise Mike is concentrating on building up his
business. In his 30 years in the house-building business Mike has seen
many ups and downs but he plans to develop Roselink to a stage where it
is building around 100 units a year.
The company uses the timber-frame building process, which is
relatively unusual and requires high quality workmanship. ''The units
are built in a factory to precise measurements, and if you don't prepare
the foundations to the correct size then you are in trouble,'' he
explains.
But the process is quicker, which means that Roselink pays less
interest to the banks on the money it raises to finance its projects.

Home affairs reporter James Freeman looks ahead to crime prevention
under the new councils.
IN THEORY, Scotland's man or woman in the street should not notice the
join in the level of policing. The service which we enjoy at present --
community-based with a heavy emphasis on crime prevention -- should
still be in place and, in theory, the current successes against
criminals by the police forces collectively and Strathclyde police in
particular should continue after local government reorganisation.
The problems for the new system may come when, with the destruction of
the strategic overview which flowed from the regional councils, policing
becomes the plaything of parochialism.
Strathclyde police have shown Scotland, the UK, and Europe that it is
no longer necessary, to paraphrase Chief Constable Leslie Sharp, to flap
our hands helplessly in the face of more and more criminality, mainly by
young men.
Specific crimes -- carrying of knives, possession of guns, armed
robbery, and drugs-related offences -- can be targeted in a way which
identifies specific offenders and takes them out of the play. Thus can
the seemingly never-ending spiral be halted and reversed, the corrosive
fear of crime reduced. But this is dependent on a number of factors.
The principal of these is resources.
From its creation in the mid 70s, Strathclyde police was
under-strength. The suspicion will always remain that this was so
because the Labour Party chose to use policing as a battleground on
which to confront its natural enemies, the Tories at the Scottish
Office, although they have always rejected this view.
It was up to the region, the biggest local government unit in Europe,
to set the level of resources it felt policing needed in Strathclyde and
their 49% of the costs would be matched by 51% from the Scottish Office,
a tried and tested formula.
Although it could point to the worth of its chosen priorities, the
Labour group in Strathclyde could never quite escape responsibility for
the shortfall in police numbers which restricted the room for manoeuvre
of successive chief constables. It clearly saw other priorities as more
important.
It was a question of police officers or home helps, as one leading
councillor put it.
However, bluffs had to be called and reality finally faced.
Strathclyde police was up to strength by the end of last year, although
-- incredibly -- only up to the number of officers approved in 1975.
Over the years of the regional councils, no other Scottish police
force was made to suffer such consistent lack of provision and Scottish
Office figures back this up. With occasional temporary lapses, every
other force was kept up to approved establishment. Is it coincidental
that Strathclyde police's spectacular successes gained impetus when the
force received its proper staffing level?
The burning question, of course, is what will come along in place of
the ideology-driven Strathclyde juggernaut in the next year -- the
portents are not entirely hopeful. Practically without exception, local
and national politicians see storms ahead.
Allowing for fear of the unknown and the bitterness felt by many
regional councillors not selected to stand in the new unitary
authorities, it is still easy to visualise a potential for vicious
conflict in the council chambers over policing.
The Scottish Office has set the tone by saying it will impose nothing,
but will consult with the new shadow councils after the elections. The
two vital areas are the composition of the new joint police boards and
how funding levels will be allocated.
The St Andrews House view is that the shape of each or any of the
eight new joint boards is a moveable feast. They need not be identical.
The predisposition of the Scottish Office will be to accept
''reasonable'' local solutions. But no firm central lead appears to be
forthcoming.
The view seems to be similarly insubstantial in relation to funding in
that, while the current 51% central Government to 49% local government
formula remains in place, exactly how that 49% is achieved is up to the
constituent councils making up the joint boards.
The Scottish Office will not impose criteria, whether funding levels
should be based on population or on crime levels, for example, but the
threat of an imposed solution remains should the new councils fail to
find a solution within the given timetables. There is a statutory duty
on them to provide for policing.
The conflicts are obvious. Should the people of Argyll and Bute who
may not see a uniform for months fork out at the the same level for
policing as, say, the citizens of Paisley or of some housing scheme
where expensive policing such as surveillance and targeting of drug
dealers is almost routine?
How will folk in leafy suburbs, targets for the housebreakers, feel
when their community officers are hauled away to beef up a special
anti-knife stop-and-search operation in Glasgow city centre while the
booze trade there continues to wax fat amid the mayhem?
It may have been different when everyone was in the same boat, under
the umbrella of Big Brother Strathclyde. However, things may now become
very fraught with what is essentially the return to parochialism.
The temptation of the 12 new constituent authorities of Strathclyde
Joint Police Board, or the five who will make up the new Lothians and
Borders Joint Police Board, to indulge in infighting is enormous.
Tayside may produce another potentially explosive mix with Dundee
city's representative certain to be Labour, Angus returning SNP members,
and Perthshire and Kinross probably returning Tory members -- and all
with their own policing agenda.
In very recent times there was an attempt by Borders Regional Council,
reflecting local dissatisfaction with policing, to fragment the joint
board they currently share with Lothian and to go it alone.
In the event, that crisis was staved off, but Mr Brian Fallon,
convener of the protection services committee of Cosla and a Labour
councillor at Lothian and Borders Regional Council, admits that policing
came close to becoming a political football between the Borders
Independents and the Lothian Labourites.
The formula which was subsequently reached, 14 joint board members
from Lothian to four from Borders, with 88.78% of the funding from
Lothian and 11.22% from Borders, may yet prove to be the model for all
the new joint boards.
The funding was arrived at on the basis of what was actually spent on
police operations on the ground in the different areas in the previous
year and allows for some flexibility. Prior to that, and obviously the
bone of contention, the formula had been based on straight population
comparisons.
Wearing his Cosla hat, Mr Fallon says: ''I am convinced that the new
authorities throughout Scotland will work together to provide the best
support for their chief constables. But with the best will in the world
you have to recognise that there will be authorities, whether in
Strathclyde, Lothian, or Tayside, with different political views,
different priorities, and under different pressures.
''It will be harder for chief constables to run their forces to please
everyone. It was always important for chief constables and chairmen of
the police committees to know what influences were driving decisions.''
Mr Fallon reflects the views of many socialists in Scottish local
government when he says that the current stable policing ethos could
suffer uncertainty at a time when the police service, under severe
pressure post-Sheehy, really needs time to draw breath.
It is all because, he claims, the Tory party wants to damage Labour
hegemony in vital areas and secure its own domination in others.
He said: ''It is a leap into the unknown which the police do not need.
There is terrific potential for conflict in the joint boards with small
authorities ganging up against the big ones. It has all been driven by
dogma and it is so unneccessary.''

VITO Crolla has become used to serving stars in the restaurants that
he has owned. Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Redford, Peter Ustinov and Sean
Connery have all enjoyed food from his kitchens.
The beaming smile with which he greets his customers in his latest
restaurant venture La Dolce Vito in Edinburgh is wider than usual as
Vito has become something of a celebrity himself.
Vito is featured in Quintin Jardine's newly published crime novel
Skinner's Trail as Mr V, the owner of a an Edinburgh restaurant bearing
the same name.
Vito gave up Mr V's restaurant last year to open up La Dolce Vito, and
he was delighted when author and PR consultant Quintin Jardine informed
him that when the paperback edition of his book is published the author
will update his book and place Mr V in La Dolce Vito.
The Italian restaurateur has been in the restaurant business since
opening his first concern in 1972.
Speaking of the stars he has served while in the business Vito, spoke
most fondly of Grace Kelly saying: ''What a women she was. I had the
pleasure of serving her several times, and she was very pleasant. She
would always order minestrone soup and a lager.''
Vito sought warmer climes in 1983 when he moved to Florida and opened
up a restaurant but could not settle, and returned to Edinburgh the
following year.
He opened Mr V's in Charlotte Lane in 1988 before deciding to move to
the larger premises in Hanover Street and open La Dolce Vito.
''My new place is three times the size of my former premises, and will
allow me to do more. In the downstair area I plan to open a bistro
coffee bar but I am not certain what I will call it. But after the book,
perhaps I will name it Mr V's coffee bar.''

Ken Smith explains why two regional departments are at odds over local
government reform.
TWO of the largest local government departments in the Scotland could
end up in conflict over the best way of preserving the jobs of their
20,000 employees.
The conflict is between the future strategies of Catering Direct and
Cleaning Direct, both of which have been revamped in recent years to
compete with the best in the private sector.
Catering Direct, with more than 8000 employees, supplies nearly 55
million meals a year to schools, colleges, and social work homes. It
wants to break away completely and remain as a single entity, providing
the meals service for the 12 new unitary councils which will replace
Strathclyde.
The bait which Ms Avril Robertson, director of Catering Direct, and
her senior staff are using to hook the new councils is the #4m of annual
savings the department makes because of its powerful bulk-buying
policies which would be lost if it was broken up.
Not only have the two major unions, the GMB and T&amp;GWU given their
backing to Catering Direct's survival, but it is lobbying councillors to
explain its case.
But its go-it-alone style is not being matched by Cleaning Direct.
With a labour force of 12,000, it is already planning for its split
into 12 separate organisations -- so-called disaggregation -- and could
eventually be competing against Catering Direct for contracts.
Gail Pain, the director of Cleaning Direct, believes that the best
option for the DSOs (direct service organisations) and the DLOs (direct
labour organisations) is for them to combine locally to provide all the
services in the individual authorities, and beat off the private sector.
Take a school for example. Cleaning Direct supplies cleaners, mainly
women, and the janitors who keep the buildings up to healthy standards.
Catering Direct supplies the meals. Ms Pain would prefer one local
service organisation to take over all the non-teaching services at the
school.
She said: ''My fear would be that if the DLOs and DSOs don't pull
together, there is a high risk of job losses in the next round of
competitive tendering.''
She argues that dividing that expertise into 12 is not viable, because
of the duplication of managements and increased costs.
Unfortunately, while the departments are trying to reorganise, there
is little breathing space before the next round of competitive
tendering. The pressure on the new authorities to agree a structure as
quickly as possible is enormous -- and the future of thousands of jobs
depends on it.

John MacCalman, Municipal Correspondent, looks at how the red rose
party is wilting under a bitter internal power struggle in Glasgow as
the polls approach.
GLASGOW is alive with class war as the city approaches the historic
single-tier elections.
However, it is not class war in the classic sense of workers versus
bosses, or the deprived versus the privileged. That conflict can be left
for Tommy Sheridan and his Militant cohorts who may well make a
significant impact.
No, the real class war is being fought within the city's Labour Party
circles between, broadly speaking, highly articulate
professional/academic types and a more traditional, grass-roots grouping
with a less impressive vocabularly.
In short, it's all about the long-running factional war and power
struggle between supporters of former Labour group leader, Councillor
Jean McFadden, and those of the current leader, Councillor Pat Lally.
It is a measure of the bitterness of the conflict that exists that the
McFaddenites refer to the Lallyites as ''thickies''.
At election time it is normally expected that even Labour can deliver
a semblance of party unity. But this time the internal class war has
overshadowed everything -- and the recurring theme is hatred.
It must be one of the most debilitating factors for the image of the
Labour Party in local government in Scotland that the largest local
authority under the new set-up is still dominated by a personality feud
that has run for more than a decade.
One party insider, who rigorously disapproves of what has been going
on, said: ''I believe that when we have genuine ideological differences
we should be able to debate them. Why do we need to have hatred?''
The current atmosphere is certainly perplexing for party members with
a trade union background who know from bitter experience that disunity
invariably means a victory for the bosses.
They see people entering the party from non trade union and non
working class background who do not understand the ethos of unity in the
Labour movement and who don't seem to care what mayhem and hatred they
create.
One distressed activist said: ''I've lost friends because of this
corrosive war between McFadden and Lally.
''There are people consumed by hatred in our constituency where some
of us used to be friends, and where we were certainly comrades. It's
very upsetting. I don't like hating people. It's such a destructive
emotion.''
In the eyes of many members, the factional war is bringing the party
into disrepute. There have been factional disputes before, but the
current scale of this particular conflict appears to be unprecedented
and has had a bearing on the selection of Labour candidates.
It is alleged in party circles that the anti-Lally faction initiated a
city-wide campaign to ensure the return of as many of its sympathisers
as possible.
It is further alleged that the Lallyites tried to preserve its
''Schindler's List'' once they woke up to the fact of their supporters
being targeted.
At the end of the day, the Lallyites took more direct damage, losing
Margaret Sinclair, Pat Chalmers, Hugh Macrae, John Gaffney, Tony
McCartney and Jimmy Barr.
The Manfesto Group, as the McFaddenites like to be called, lost John
Ross and John Chalmers, plus three more from Rutherglen and Cambuslang
who have been translated to another plane of activity in the new South
Lanarkshire authority.
Another disgruntled party member complained: ''It's the first time
that I've seen such open contempt for the right of local ward Labour
parties to pick the local candidate that they think can best represent
Labour in a particular area.
''These, after all, are the people who deliver the votes and I think
the repercussions will be felt for many years to come. Some people have
been sickened and others have really been angered by the assumption that
somehow they are just there as figures in a stage army to be moved
around at the behest of self-appointed high-flyers.''
The whole Byzantine episode has been characterised by a series of deft
strokes, if not abuses, to ensure the selection of Labour candidates
with the appropriate clan loyalty.
One of the most telling tactics was manipulation of the timetables for
selection meetings. The rationale was that if a group of like-minded
party members within a constituency wanted to unseat existing Labour
councillors, there was tremendous advantage in manipulating the
timetable so that your friends are re-selected first, then the people
you are trying to de-select realise only too late that they have been
targeted and can't retaliate.
It appears that people have used the dates of meetings for factional
political advantage.
The lesson must surely be that in future the party should decide on a
procedure of drawing lots to determine the timetabling of ward selection
meetings so that this device cannot again be used for politcal ends.
A second tactic was the manipulation of membership information. The
guidelines were not at all clear but the ruling given by Scottish Labour
Party headquarters was that in any disputes about membership the final
arbiter would be the print-out of a constituency's entire membership
sent up periodically from the party's national headquarters in London.
In Glasgow, the temporary local government committee, which drew up
the panel of Labour candidates, decided that the freeze date for
membership would be December 21, 1994. Therefore, the only accurate list
of paid-up members entitled to take part in nomination and selection
meetings should have been contained within a print-out that covered
everybody's membership information up to and including that freeze date.
Using an earlier print-out, say one that was printed in early
December, did not allow for the fact that someone might have paid their
membership subsequent to that, but before the freeze date.
Therefore, the critical print-out should have been the one dated
January 25, 1995.
But in some areas information from an earlier print-out was used to
produce exhaustive lists of eligible branch members.
According to informed sources the whole process was ill-founded
because the up-to-date membership list had not arrived.
The outcome being that someone who may have paid in late December,
before the freeze date, would not be shown in the membership list as
paid up.
Conversely, some people whose membership had not been processed into
the list by the freeze date, thought wrongly that because they had a
receipt for their money, paid at branch or constituency level, many
months previously, they were eligible members.
However, the bottom line was -- if people were not on the list as paid
up by the freeze date they were ineligible to participate at nomination
or selection meetings.
Another device related to the quorum of eight members required for
meetings to take place. There have been allegations of party members not
being informed that nomination meetings were being held resulting in
meetings being declared inquorate and the business referred to the
higher constituency where perhaps a faction's greater strength could be
made to tell.
A disillusioned party member complained: ''They started civil wars in
local parties because of their particular view of how things were going
at City Chambers.
''They aren't interested in the views of the party activists in local
areas. They are a self-opinionated clique of party activists and
councillors who see nothing wrong in imposing, not only their views, but
their candidates on every local Labour Party.
''That's Stalinism.''
Naturally, the other political parties are poised to take advantage of
Labour's internal squabblings by mounting a serious challenge in many of
new authority's 83 seats .
These new wards are much smaller than the 66 wards of the current
district council and offer opportunities for parties concentrating on
localities, as well as maximising the impact of a well-rooted local
candidate.
One experienced campaigner said: ''I would say that in virtually any
seat in the city, if a candidate has 500 pledges, he or she would be
pretty close to being home and dry once you dig out the rest on polling
day. That might cause a few upsets.''
There could be difficulties for Labour given that there are quite a
few straight fights and in many wards the party will be lucky if it has
two or three people out working.
The SNP, on the other hand, could make an impact if it has the sense
to concentrate its forces and perhaps go flat out in 10 wards.
Militant's 19 candidates could benefit from the heightened profile of
the charismatic leader Tommy Sheridan and his campaigns on housing
repairs and the controversial M77 extension in the south side of
Glasgow.
Militant could possibly take the Summerhill seat in Drumchapel, having
come within 46 votes of defeating Labour's Dorcas Bowman at the last
district elections.
Summerhill has been virtually a ghost Labour Party branch in recent
times and is now on its fourth Labour candidate in seven years.
There could be a few surprises, but it really depends on how the
opposition parties organise themselves to take advantage of the almost
endemic complacency in much of the Labour Party.
This is demonstrated by the intensity with which the selection battles
have been fought. People still think if they are selected as a Labour
candidate they are as good as elected.
Opposition parties able to deploy half-a-dozen activists in a given
area would probably be doing better than many Labour Party branches.
With the smaller number of votes to be fought for in each of the
smaller wards, the contest could turn out to be quite interesting.

Multivitamins are all very well, but is there any substitute for good
old fruit and vegetables? Elizabeth Westcott examines both sides of the
argument.
A LIFETIME of eating potato waffles, bacon and haggis will not only
fail to provide adequate nutrition, it will ultimately contribute to the
likelihood of suffering from serious illnesss in later life. Knowing
this, many people are now looking more critically at what goes into
their bodies but dietary habits are hard to change, so is reaching for
supplements the solution? Perhaps an algae tablet, ''nature's richest
food'' or a ''French Paradox'' capsule, containing all the anti-oxidant
benefits of red wine without the downside of alcohol. Even the humble
multivitamin is hailed by the health trade for its ''rejuvenating
properties'' and energy-boosting prowess. The leaflets sound good. But
do these wonder products really promote better health?
Dr Mike Lean, Professor of Human Nutrition at Glasgow University, is
dubious about the claims made by some of these extracts. Nothing, he
says, is a substitute for fresh fruit and vegetables.
''If you think you can buy a tablet, swallow it in the evening and
cram all the goodness of a portion of vegetables, then you are being
deceived,'' he said. ''We have no proof that vitamin tablets are very
beneficial.''
Dr Lean pointed out the difficulty in testing the health of those
taking supplements with those who don't. Tablet takers may be more
health-conscious altogether and have other factors contributing to their
well-being, like cycling to work. Until there is some solid evidence as
to the benefits of supplements the solution to nutritional deficiencies
is to eat a balanced diet, he says.
''In general, most people know they should be getting their vitamins
and minerals from fruit and vegetables, but most people do not get
anywhere near enough. What we need to do is tell people how much they
should be eating.''
So how much fruit and vegetables do we need for our basic vitamins and
minerals? According to Dr Lean, our daily intake should be a pound in
weight -- more than double what most of us are eating now.
''You need to have a piece of fruit with each meal and two portions of
vegetables, one at lunch and one at dinner. The piece of fruit should be
apple-sized and the vegetables should take up half the plate or fill a
small bowl . . . Not a leaf of lettuce or a slice of tomato.''
One of the fruit portions can be replaced with a decent-sized glass of
orange or apple juice, but lemon squash will not do; it must be pure,
fresh fruit juice.
''For most people, half the battle would be won if they remembered to
eat a piece of fruit at breakfast,'' said Dr Lean.
Inadequate nutrition is, without question, contributing to the
worryingly high level of serious illness in Scotland, such as heart
disease, cancer and arthritis. Fundamental eating patterns need to be
changed -- popping a French Paradox pill to rid the body of cell
damaging ''free radicals'' is unlikely to stave off the problems caused
by a lifetime of bad eating habits.
''There's currently a lot of interest in the anti-oxidant effects of
red wine. What they are saying about these tablets is that you can get
those effects without alcohol,'' said Dr Lean.
Anti-oxidants belong to a group called Flavonoids, which are currently
being explored by researchers. ''They are basically compounds found in
plant fodder which are quite powerful and important and work a bit like
vitamins. They are certainly present in wine, and the skins of some
vegetables. What we don't know is whether taking a pill like this really
does any good,'' said Dr Lean.
''The message for cancer is the same as for heart disease; increase
fruit and vegetables and reduce the amount of animal fats, which creep
up in things like ice-cream.
''What is really important is eating the right foods all your life. It
may be too late to suddenly start taking vitamins midway through your
life.''
Lorraine Grant, a consultant for a supplement company, has a different
view. She believes that not only can everyone benefit from taking
supplements, but that everyone needs them. ''People in the health trade
agree with nutritionists in that nutrition is what keeps the body
going,'' she said. ''Where we disagree is that they claim you can get
all your needs from food alone. What we say is that you can get
nutrition from food, but not enough.''
''I would say that everybody needs supplements. In a huge test in the
United States -- there they get fresher food than we do here -- out of
20,000 taken from all kinds of backgrounds, not one person reached the
recommended daily amount for the ten essential nutrients. That's
frightening.
''The next best thing is to eat as well as you can and supplement your
intake with a basic multivitamin and mineral.''
Ms Grant claims that multivitamins and other supplements are getting
more popular all the time, not because of the public's gullibility for
''wonder'' promotions but due to an increased health consciousness.
''The figures for serious disease in Scotland are horrendous and people
are becoming more aware of it,'' she said. ''People don't take vitamins
as a replacement for fruit and vegetables, but as a supplement to what
they're already eating. The problem with fruit is that it takes a long
time to get to us. Oranges are picked before they are ripe, so the
enzymes aren't working properly. A bruise on an apple can cause a chain
reaction so the fruit is not as good. People think they have had their
Vitamin C from an orange, but in fact there may not have been that much
there. In that case, a supplement can help.''
Ms Grant is also confident of the benefits of the less well-known
supplements, like algae and red wine extract, but points out that health
companies cannot make unauthorised claims as to their effectiveness.
However, she has no doubt that supplements are the key to good health.
The choice is not between synthesised chemical compounds and nature's
offerings. No multivitamin is ever going to replace the goodness of a
daily pound of fruit and vegetables. What is clear though, is that we
ignore our diet at our peril. Nutrition is the good oil which stops our
bodies from crumbling. We ae all living longer, so we might as well live
healthier and choosing a balanced diet -- which most of us think we have
already but very few of us actually do -- is the best insurance we are
going to get.

WE ALL know that feeling of stress or anxiety that is caused by
deadlines to meet, hurry-hurry-hurry or I'll be too late, lose my job,
miss my appointment. It isn't good for us, but we allow it to become our
way of life.
So what can stress do to us?
It stops us getting to sleep, makes us tired and crotchety next
morning, less able to cope with the day's work, with relationships, with
driving long distances. It endangers our lifestyle.
Worse, it has an effect on our bodies.
We know that the forceful, stressed-type ''A'' personality is twice as
likely to get heart problems. We know that stress lowers the body's
resistance to infection and that it alters the normal circadian rhythm
in sleep as well as the hormonal output we need to allow a good day. The
leap in blood pressure caused by a stressful situation may not lead to
chronic hypertension, but if repeated again and again throughout the day
does not do us much good.
We bring it on ourselves and we should recognise this and change our
lifestyle to allow our bodies to work normally. The trouble is we often
feel we cannot. We need the job. We need the money. Our families depend
on us. I have heard it all. The fact remains that if we allow stress to
continue we may not be around to look after our families anyway.
So call a halt. Accept your limitations. Change your lifestyle to one
that leaves you able to cope with your work. It is extraordinary how
small a change is sometimes needed. Work supervisers can be helpful.
Union members can look to their representatives for advice and support.
Employers are willing to bend to keep a good employee.
Doctors used to treat stress with benzodiazepines. They certainly made
you feel calm. Unfortunately they are also addictive and their effect
wears off. We don't offer them now except in short courses. Instead,
stress-relieving techniques such as aromatherapy, meditation, and yogic
exercises have become popular. Like the medicines that went before they
can ease a situation that is damaging; they don't cure it. If they can
keep you going, fine. The cure is to adjust your lifestyle so that each
day is fulfilling, not crippling.
Can't get to sleep? It's anxiety. Can't stay asleep? It's depression
-- in the clinical sense -- say the text books. But in most of the cases
I see it is not so clear cut.
We should never have called that psychiatric illness where the patient
feels worthless, the world not worth living in and the future bleak,
''depression''. Clinically depressed patients may have hallucinations
and delusions; their mood may vary between being wildly manic and
completely down; and they may entertain and act on suicidal thoughts.
They are a far cry from those of us who feel miserable because we are
unhappy or lonely or tired or unable to cope. However it is possible to
see a connecting downward path in mood from what is a normal reaction to
an unhappy situation to the psychotic state that requires treatment.
We should be aware that the following symptoms may herald the onset of
clinical depression: a gloomy mood that won't shake off; diminished
pleasure in ordinary activities; marked weight loss or gain for no
reason or appetite changes; early wakening with an inability to get back
to sleep; agitation or lethargy; feelings of worthlessness or
inappropriate guilt; inability to concentrate or to make up one's mind;
recurrent thoughts of death or suicide; social withdrawal and loss of
interest in appearance and dress.
If you or anyone you know well feels continually miserable and has at
least five of these symptoms for longer than seems normal, the time has
come for a visit to the doctor.
I like to think that with the new medication available, together with
expert counselling and the support of those close to our patients we may
get to grips with what is a widespread and debilitating illness.

THE paddle steamer Waverley eventually steamed through the Bell's
swing bridge in Glasgow en route to Garvel dry dock in Greenock for the
final stages of a major refit yesterday.
The steamer is now on course to begin her 1995 season on the Clyde
over Easter weekend, a mission that seemed impossible only weeks ago as
she lay trapped at her winter berth at Anderston Quay.
The Waverley's entire spring programme had been in jeopardy while
Glasgow Development Agency, which owns Bell's Bridge, and the management
of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, which is responsible
for the north retaining wall, were locked in talks over the future of
the bridge.
The bridge and north wall were both damaged by December floods from
the River Kelvin with the result that the bridge, originally temporarily
erected for the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival, could not be opened.
Both the GDA and SECC Ltd were at pains yesterday to emphasise the
complexity of the bridge problem which has eventually been resolved in a
#20,000 repair job by Lilley Construction. The work took just over a
week.
As for the Waverley, she is now about to embark on her 21st
anniversary season since being donated to the Paddle Steamer
Preservation Society and she has been the subject of major surgery
costing #350,000 to allow her to conform to new Department of Transport
safety regulations.
Her general manager Mr David Duncanson said: ''This money has been
raised by members of the PSPS and from the ships' passengers and should
enable us to steam on well into the next century as a major leisure
attraction. Last year we recorded 88,971 passenger journeys on the Clyde
over a period of 11 weeks, our best performance for 10 years.''
Waverley intends to continue to use Anderston Quay as her Glasgow base
following the Bell's Bridge repairs. A loud blast on the ship's whistle
yesterday signalled the relief as she steamed down river.

SCOTLAND will go into the next millennium with a population of around
5.15 million -- a lengthy guest-list for the big party, if anyone is
thinking of throwing one to celebrate the occasion. But the number of
people living north of the Tweed will start falling from then, dwindling
to 5.08 million by the year 2011.
The information comes from a booklet published today by the Registrar
General for Scotland. Population Projections, Scotland, summarises the
latest population predictions for the country's administrative areas. It
also details the national projection for Scotland as prepared by the
Government Actuary.
It predicts that Scotland's population will rise from 5.11 million in
1992 to 5.15 million next year, where it will remain until the year
2000.
Scotland's population has declined steadily over the 1980s from the
5.2 million it stood at during the previous decade, though small
increases have been recorded in recent years.
The booklet attributes those increases to small net migration gains
and a small excess of births over deaths.
A breakdown predicts that, with the exception of the Western Isles
islands area and three of the health board areas within Strathclyde, the
populations of all regions, HBAs and islands areas should increase up to
the year 2006.
Shetland islands area, Grampian region, Highland region and Orkney
islands area show the greatest increases -- 7% for Shetlands, 6% for the
others.
Western Isles is projected to show a 4.3% fall and Strathclyde one of
4.2%.
Among the districts, the largest percentage gains by 2006 are for
Kincardine and Deeside, 18%, Gordon, 15%, Inverness, 13%.
Inverclyde is expected to experience the sharpest decline -- around
15%. Both Caithness and Monklands are projected to suffer 10% decreases.
The next round of projections by administrative areas -- available
early next year -- will cover the new unitary councils.
The booklet's final words are a disclaimer which warns that the
figures are only calculations which depend on certain assumptions, such
as future fertility, mortality and migration.
''Projections show the most likely view of the future; it is not
necessarily inevitable,'' it states.

CHILDREN on a Glasgow housing estate are seven times more likely to be
killed or injured than elsewhere in Britain, according to Government
figures revealed by a road safety Minister yesterday.
At its conference in the city, Mr Steven Norris, MP for Epping Forest,
told the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents that Drumchapel's
streets were among the most dangerous in the UK for child pedestrian
casualties.
Mr Norris defended planners who designed the estate after the Second
World War who, he said, would have had little idea of the amount of
traffic eventually using its roads.
But, he added: ''It's a feature of urban life having vehicles
competing for space. In Liverpool, we used to kick a ball around all day
long and never see a car.''
Traffic experts are now trying to hammer home the message that ''cars
can kill'' through the use of closed-circuit TV cameras at school gates
on the estate.
A pilot project, with research carried out by psychologists from
Strathclyde University, is aimed at getting parents and teachers to work
together to instil sensible road drill into children as young as five.
Organisers claim it is already reaping rewards. Literature, based on
recent Drumchapel results, is aimed at cutting casualty rates in similar
housing schemes throughout the UK.
Mr Norris said: ''The child accident record in an estate like
Drumchapel is not good. You just have to look at the way the scheme is
designed, the lay-out of houses and narrow roads, to see why.
''It's a real safety hazard for young children who don't have anywhere
to play safely. We are teaching youngsters road skills to prepare them
for a real situation like Drumchapel, and not an ideal one.''
Mr Norris said road accidents killed 10 children in Britain every
week, and many of the victims did not have the necessary safety skills
to avoid an accident.
Later, highlighting a project aimed at encouraging stores to build
distribution outlets on the outskirts of towns in order to combat
inner-city congestion, Mr Norris said that lorries could be banned from
making deliveries to town centre shops.
The Department of Transport is examining a scheme for all trucks
carrying goods destined for town centre stores to drop their loads at an
edge-of-town point, to be picked up by other vehicles for the final leg
of the journey, cutting down town centre congestion.
Mr Norris said he had asked officials to study the success of a pilot
scheme in Germany, which had cut down heavy goods vehicle traffic in
town centres, and could be introduced in Britain in 1996.

<HEADLINE>Partner Welsh breaks 10-year silence.  'Special Branch watched McRae'</HEADLINE>

LEADING Scottish Nationalist Mr Willie McRae was under Special Branch
surveillance for many years before his mysterious death in 1985,
according to his closest business colleague.
Former Glasgow solicitor Mr Ronnie Welsh has broken a 10-year silence,
and in an exclusive interview with The Herald, has given his views on
the controversy surrounding his legal partner's death on a lonely road
near Loch Loyne, Inverness-shire.
Mr Welsh trained under Mr McRae and later joined him in his new
practice, McRae and Co, in Buchanan Street, Glasgow, in 1982.
Mr Welsh was devastated by his sudden death. He ''let the business
go'' and in November 1987 was struck off the solicitors' roll for
alleged financial irregularities.
He moved from Scotland to a new life in north-west England, his
whereabouts since 1986 remaining a mystery to all but his close friends
and family. The Herald tracked him down and last night he gave his first
interview in almost 10 years.
Certain facts are known: Mr McRae's car was found 29 yards off the A87
at Loch Loyne on the morning of Saturday April 6, 1985. He was found in
the driving seat, the apparent victim of a road accident.Many hours
later when Mr McRae was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary a nurse
discovered a gun-shot wound to his right temple.
A 48-hour police investigation led the procurator-fiscal at Inverness
to state that there were no suspicious circumstances and the then
Solicitor-General, Mr Peter Fraser, ruled against a fatal accident
inquiry.
Friends of Mr McRae have since speculated that he was murdered and may
have been the subject of MI5 and Special Branch surveillance.
''I think at the time all political figures were under surveillance.
You could spot the Special Branch officers at Bannockburn rallies by
their big police boots,'' quipped Mr Welsh.
''Willie was not overly concerned by this, but sometimes it bothered
him -- it had gone on for a few years and he felt they paid him special
attention.''
Mr Welsh dismissed as ''press speculation'' any connections between Mr
McRae and the Scottish National Liberation Army (SNLA). He said Mr
McRae's dealings with SNLA terrorists David Dinsmore and Adam Busby were
on the basis of giving legal advice and ''purely professional''.
Mr Welsh is not convinced the maverick lawyer's death was suicide. He
is also concerned by this week's revelations in The Herald.
''If it is found the the Crown has been lying, then they must be
brought to book,'' he urged, ''and then a full inquiry must obviously
follow.'' He suggests that any cover-up by Crown Office officials may be
to hide shortcomings of the police activities after Mr McRae's death.
Mr Welsh speculates on Mr McRae's final hours: ''He had a serious
drink problem. One scenario is that Willie had had an accident near
Invergarry, he may have been drinking and then the car ran off the road.
''Then what may have gone through his mind is that he already had
three drink-driving convictions and, with a fourth pending, he would
have been frightened of the prospect of a custodial sentence.
''But I can't reconcile that scenario with my feeling that, if he was
going to kill himself, he would have done it in his croft in Kintail
rather than there and then on the hillside.
''And something else doesn't seem to fit. When Willie left the office
at midday on Friday he was in cheerful spirits, had made appointments
for the following week and that was it. He gave no sign that he was
suicidal.''

THE BBC's live coverage of Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations, seen by
millions throughout Britain, has been criticised by senior officials and
councillors on Edinburgh District Council.
The massive open-air event attracted 180,000 people to a street party
in Princes Street and a show by Runrig in Princes Street Gardens.
Around 600,000 people in central Scotland alone watched the BBC
Hogmanay show on television, which featured the Edinburgh celebrations
on the programme.
A council report on the event says that the quality and content of the
live coverage was very disappointing, given the BBC's level of
investment in it. It also claims that the coverage is a subject of
concern within the BBC.
The Herald can reveal that BBC chiefs will meet senior council
officials at a special meeting in Edinburgh on April 12 to discuss the
issue.
Despite the disappointment over the television coverage, a special
council report to be discussed today will say how delighted officials
were with the event itself and how it was staged.
District council leader Lesley Hinds said she had written to the BBC
after receiving a number of complaints over the past few months from the
public over the BBC coverage.
Councillor Hinds said people were angry that the BBC coverage did not
capture the atmosphere of Hogmanay in Edinburgh. ''People said the
coverage could have been coming from anywhere,'' she said. ''They did
not get the feel of what was going on.''
The evaluation has been put together by the council's chief executive,
Bill Blyth, and executive director of economic development and estates,
Krystina Robinson. It was called for in order to gauge the success of
Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations.
A council source said they were angry that they had bent over
backwards to accommodate the BBC by changing starting times of acts, but
had been unhappy with the final live coverage.
The source said their concern had been shared by partners in the
staging of the Hogmanay event, Lothian Regional Council and Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise Limited.
Ms Jill Crofts, assistant to the chief executive, said: ''We felt the
scale of the event or the atmosphere of things like the street party
were not projected as we would have liked. There will be talks with the
BBC, at their instigation, in Edinburgh next month on the subject of the
Hogmanay show.''
Ms Crofts said that the council would be negotiating with STV, BBC and
Sky this year for the contract to broadcast this year's event.
Despite pinpointing the disappointing coverage this year, the
evaluation says that the BBC's own view of the potential of the event
was likely to bring an early commitment to coverage from it.
A BBC spokesman said they had not heard of the council's criticism.
The spokesman added: ''We have not yet seen the document, but would be
happy to respond to any sections relevant to BBC programming.''
Overall, the report said that the Hogmanay celebrations themselves in
Edinburgh had been a massive success. It said that a five-year-plan of
events for every Hogmanay leading up to the millennium should be put
into place.
Last year 20% of visitors to the Hogmanay event were first-time
visitors to the city. Most were in the 16 to 44 age group, but there was
a trend for more families to attend, particularly the day-time events on
December 31.
The increased tourism and the expert way the event was staged by the
company brought in to oversee it has pleased the council.
It is believed that the council will pump at least #55,000 into
staging next year's event when it discusses the report.
Councillor Hinds said: ''Despite our reservations over the BBC
coverage, we were delighted at the number of people attending the event
and the way it was staged.''

Brussels, Wednesday,
THE European Commission discovered #900m in fraud last year, but
Anti-Fraud Commissioner Anita Gradin admitted today she could only guess
''whether even larger amounts ended up in the wrong pockets''.
She suggested the official figure of 1.2% of the EU's budget lost to
fraud was perhaps only the tip of the iceberg.
Tricksters exploit differences in laws in the EU's 15 member countries
to ''select a la carte which legislation suits them best'', she said.
The differences allow them to set up international crime rings to
defraud the EU with little prospect of ending up in jail.
''The sanctions against fraud of the member states must become more
uniform,'' Gradin said, complaining that some EU countries have up to 70
definitions of fraud.
The latest swindles again centered on agricultural subsidies, which
account for about half of the EU's vast annual budget.
Whether detection has improved or fraud has increased, the number of
swindles detected increased by two-thirds last year and the amounts
involved doubled.
At least #660m has been lost from the customs rebate system since 1990
and controls have become more lax over the years, giving the criminals
even more leeway. With 18 million transit declarations a year, the
system itself has become barely manageable.
''The quality of controls have fallen progressively over the last few
years,'' an EU statement said today.
Gradin fears such abuses may mean EU taxpayers lose confidence. ''The
taxpayers in the Union have to be assured that their money is not spent
in a fraudulent way,'' she said.--AP

<TEXT>
Rome, Wednesday,
ITALIAN physicists have detected what they believe may be evidence of
nuclear ''cold fusion'' in experiments using hydrogen and nickel,
reports said today.
Professor Sergio Focardi of the University of Bologna said that 15
grammes of nickel and one gramme of hydrogen produced 30 to 40 watts of
energy -- sufficient to power a light bulb for around three months,
according to the AGI news agency.
Focardi said about 100 kilowatt hours of energy had been produced so
far in the experiments, a quantity that ruled out a chemical reaction as
the source of the power.
Scientists have long theorised that fusion, the process that powers
the sun, could provide all the world's electricity needs without using
any fossil fuel if harnessed.
Many physicists, however, have dismissed cold fusion as a delusion.
In 1989 British scientist Martin Fleischmann and American Stanley
Pons, working at the University of Utah, claimed to have detected fusion
in an experiment conducted at room temperatures.
Since then scientists around the world have been attempting to
duplicate their experiments with little success.
The Italian experiments are being carried out by physicists from the
unversities of Bologna, Siena and Cagliari and were discussed at Bologna
University today.
Professor Focardi said: ''We have the certainty that the system we are
experimenting with produces energy through a process that is perfectly
replicable and controllable.
''Measures based on controlling the external temperature of the system
prove without a shadow of doubt that energy is emitted from this
system.''
He added: ''We have observed neutrons and gamma rays, which are
fortunately few and can easily be eliminated. The presence of this
radiation is proof that nuclear reactions are occurring but they cannot
be explained with current knowledge of physics.''--Reuter

New York, Wednesday,
SCIENTISTS said today they had discovered a rich nest of dinosaur
fossils buried in the Mongolian desert in one of the biggest finds ever
from the age of the dinosaurs.
Mongolian and American palaeontologists said they had found hundreds
of fossilised skeletons from the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous
periods, 65 to 248 million years ago.
In a report in the science journal Nature, Michael Novacek of New
York's American Museum of Natural History said they hoped to find many
more valuable fossils in the Ukhaa Tolgod site in the Gobi Desert.
''In the main collecting area (about 1.5 square miles), recovered and
uncollected articulated skeletons of theropod, ankylosauran, and
protoceratopsian dinosaurs represent over 100 individuals,'' they wrote.
''Specimens collected also include skulls (many with associated
skeletons) of over 400 mammals and lizards, skeletons including the
first known skull of the bird Mononykus and nest sites that preserve the
first known theropod dinosaur embryos.''
They added: ''The diversity and abundance of theropods, mammals, and
lizards are unusually high.''
They said this indicated that the fossils were entombed in sand
immediately. ''At most Mesozoic sites with fossil mammals, one finds a
tooth or two and retires content,'' they said. ''At Ukhaa Tolgod,
though, there is little excuse not to find entire nestfuls.''--Reuter

Port-au-Prince, Wednesday,
NEW violence has flared in the troubled island of Haiti after a former
top official of its military regime was machine-gunned to death on a
busy street in the capital, Port-au-Prince.
Mireille Durocher Bertin, 34, the mother of four children and an
ardent defender of former military chief Lieutenant-General Raoul
Cedras, was shot while travelling in her car, said US embassy spokesman
Stanley Schrager. The driver, one of her legal clients, was also killed.
To many, she symbolised the open defiance of Haiti's elite mulatto
class which rejected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his huge base
of populist support among the nation's poor and uneducated.
Scuffles broke out with US peace-keepers, with tensions on the island
alreay high. President Bill Clinton is due to visit Haiti on Friday,
along with UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to witness US-led
multinational forces hand over responsibility for security to 6900 UN
peacekeepers.
Aristide asked for US assistance in investigating the assassination.
The White House said a team of FBI agents would arrive in Haiti today.
Washington condemned the assassination of the prominent lawyer and
said the violence should not deter Haiti's political and economic
reforms.
''It was clearly a political killing,'' Schrager said.
The assassination of a prominent supporter of Haiti's 1991 military
coup and opposition politician sends a dire message as the country gears
up for elections crucial to its progress toward democracy.
Durocher Bertin was briefly chief of staff of the army-linked
Government formed by Emile Jonassaint in 1994 while President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in exile.
Last week, she formed a new opposition party, the Movement to
Integrate the Nation, and friends said she hoped to become a senator.
Witnesses at the scene said three heavily armed gunmen shot at the
tyres of the vehicle on one of the capital's busiest streets. They then
opened fire with machine guns, spraying the white Subaru with several
rounds of bullets.
The men jumped back into their own car and sped away.
Also killed was Eugene Ballergeau, an airplane pilot and client of
Durocher Bertin and driver of the car.
Durocher Bertin, who often acted as a spokeswoman for the military
leaders who ousted President Aristide in a bloody 1991 coup, served
briefly as chief of staff for the de facto regime.
Jacques Durocher, the father of the attractive, eloquent
English-speaking lawyer, said his daughter had received dozens of death
threats since the return of Aristide on October 15.
Visibly upset and angry, Durocher claimed that his daughter's name had
appeared on a ''hit list'' in a newspaper for Haitian exiles in New
York.
''This was done intentionally for Mr Clinton and his Operation Uphold
Democracy,'' Durocher told reporters. -- Reuter

Riga, Wednesday
A TRAINLOAD of migrants who have shuttled between Russia and the
Baltic states for a week without finding refuge moved back into Russia
today as UN workers headed to help them.
Immigration police in the Latvian capital Riga told Reuters that the
group of about 100 migrants, probably from the Middle East and Asia, had
headed for Russia on a morning train to St Petersburg after a night on
the Latvian-Lithuanian border.
Since last Thursday the men, women and children have been shuttling on
trains between the three countries, crossing at least one border under
border police supervision every day.
Four of the original group were taken to hospital in Lithuania earlier
this week, according to officials there.
A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in
Stockholm said he understood the group were now in Russia, though the
information remained unconfirmed.
''At present we are waiting for some form of confirmation from the
Latvian Government on this,'' said Lennart Kotsalainen, UNHCR deputy
representative for the Nordic and Baltic region.
He said his agency's Moscow office would send two workers to the area,
thought to be the town of Pytalovo in western Russia, later today to try
to help solve the migrants' plight.
Latvian officials, who say they first noticed the group on a train in
the eastern city of Daugavpils last Thursday, said they firmly believed
the migrants had come to Latvia from Russia.
''They definitely came from Russia,'' Interior Ministry spokesman
Normunds Belskis told Reuters.
''We are now working with the Lithuanians and the Estonians on this --
maybe there will be a joint announcement,'' he added, in a sign the
three Baltic states may close ranks on the matter.
Officials believe organised crime is behind an expanding business
smuggling humans from poverty-stricken countries like Afghanistan and
Iraq through the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Baltic states,
and into affluent Scandinavia.

Athens, Wednesday
PUBLIC Order Minister Stelios Papathemelis resigned today after
disagreeing with plans to send in riot police against farmers.
He quit shortly before an emergency meeting called by the Socialist
Government after the farmers, angry at a new tax law, drove their
colourful fleet of tractors closer to Athens.
The tractors, many flying blue and white Greek flags, raced along the
main north-south highway to within 36 miles of the capital and seized
the last toll station before Athens, ignoring Government warnings that
time was running out for their tax revolt.
''Today Schimatari, tomorrow Athens. We'll take over parliament,'' a
gleeful farmer shouted to television reporters.
Papathemelis had argued passionately that sending in riot police would
lead to bloodshed.
Thousands of shops across Greece closed today to back the tax revolt.
It began in the fertile Thessaly plain 10 days ago, cutting Greece in
two and crippling the economy.
Officials estimate more than 100,000 tonnes of vegetables, fruit,
milk, meat and other produce have rotted. Thousands of foreign and Greek
lorries have been trapped in blockades stretching from Athens to east of
Salonika.
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's Government has taken a hands-off
approach so far, prompting opposition parties to accuse him of being
unable to handle the dispute.
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told reporters today that
time was running out and it would be wrong to confuse patience with
weakness.
He said: ''Nobody has the right to break the spinal cord of the
country.''
The central issue for both farmers and shopkeepers is a new tax law's
''objective criteria'', which calculate the minimum tax which must be
paid regardless of declared income.
The criteria take into account everything from the size of a farm or
shop to the kind of car the owner drives to calculate what his minimum
revenue must have been in 1994.
The law, approved by parliament last year, is designed to stamp out
rampant tax evasion and curb a thriving black economy estimated to be
worth up to #30bn a year.--Reuter

Abidjan, Wednesday
FRANCE today threw its weight behind African cocoa producers in a
fight to keep non-cocoa vegetable fats out of European chocolate. If the
fight is won, British confectioners will have to improve their products.
A French Economy Ministry official said here: ''On incorporation in
chocolate products of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter, the
authorities are clear: they are opposed to it.''
Ivory Coast estimates cocoa-producing countries could lose as much as
#230m yearly if manufacturers are allowed to use more cocoa substitutes.
The EU is reviewing proposals to harmonise its rules on non-cocoa
vegetable fat in chocolate. Britain, Ireland, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden
and Austria permit five per cent vegetable fat, and the others allow
more expensive cocoa butter only.--Reuter

Berlin, Wednesday
NORTH Korea's mission in Berlin, once its main listening station in
Europe, is a sorry vestige of the Cold War but is proving useful to US
efforts to woo the communist state away from making a nuclear bomb.
The North Koreans and Americans use their diplomatic missions, both
sites of their former big embassies in what was communist East Berlin,
for sensitive talks on replacing North Korea's plutonium-producing
nuclear reactors with safer plants.
On Monday, the latest round broke up without an agreement. Both sides
indicated today they would probably meet next month, again in Berlin.
The symbolism of holding nuclear talks affecting a Korean peninsula
still divided by communism and capitalism in a city that experienced the
pain of partition has not gone unnoticed.
''It will not be long before pieces of barbed wire entanglements
installed along the Demilitarised Zone on the Korean peninsula join the
pieces of the dismantled Berlin Wall displayed at museums,'' South
Korean President Kim Young-sam said on a state visit to Germany three
weeks ago.
Both Korea and Germany were divided as a result of the Second World
War. Communist forces ended up occupying one part of each country and
Western allies the other.
Communist North Korea was one of East Germany's most stalwart
supporters but after German unification in 1990, less than a year after
the Berlin Wall fell, it lost its embassy status as well as diplomatic
recognition with united Germany.
Like an old retainer allowed to stay on by new landowners, the North
Koreans were permitted by the German Government to remain in the
reunited city, albeit in reduced circumstances.
In a triumph of pragmatism over diplomatic regulation, a German
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in Bonn said it was considered better to
hold on to East Germany's embassy buildings in Pyongyang than pull out
altogether.
''We have no diplomatic relations with North Korea but as we inherited
the embassy from the DDR (East Germany), we decided to keep it open as
an interest section,'' the spokeswoman said. ''In exchange, the North
Koreans have an interest section in Berlin.''
Diplomatic sources said the main reasons why Berlin was chosen for
nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington were ''expertise'' and
flight connections -- a left-over from the Cold War is a once-a-week
direct flight to Pyongyang and back from eastern Berlin's Schoenefeld
airport, a rare service in Europe.
Although US troops have left west Berlin, the Americans have kept much
of their diplomatic staff (around 100) in the east and occupy the same
building off Unter den Linden avenue.
But the North Koreans have moved out of their five-storey,
white-washed block and retreated into side buildings.
Their mission is swamped by roadworks and building sites destined to
make Berlin a capitalist mecca. It appears the North Koreans have neatly
lifted a leaf out of the free-market book.
Its main embassy building, once bristling with antennae before the
Berlin Wall was chipped away in 1989, is now occupied by insurance firms
and a women's keep-fit centre which pay the North Koreans for the
privilege.
''As far as I know we're still paying rent to the North Koreans,'' a
spokesman for one firm said.--Reuter

Baghdad, Wednesday
IRAQI doctors are operating on patients without anaesthesia and
turning away non-emergency cases because of shortages of drugs and
medicine, health officials and doctors said today.
The crisis has been brought on by UN trade sanctions, they said.
''The situation is so tragic. Imagine patients coming here and we turn
them away for lack of medicine,'' Dr Uthman Abdullah said.
Doctors said four people died at Baghdad's Saddam Teaching Hospital's
emergency ward every day.
''We could save them with proper medicine,'' said Dr Bashar Jameel.
Senior Health Ministry official Shawky Marcus said hospitals were now
only dealing with emergencies. Doctors were operating without
anaesthesia.
''Is there any doctor in any country who would accept the idea of a
child treated without anaesthesia?'' he said.
Each ward at the hospital is given four syringes a day.
''We boil them or sometimes they are just cleaned and recycled,'' said
Jameel.
Under the sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
imports of medicine and food are permitted. But with its assets frozen
and oil exports choked off, Baghdad says it has no ready cash to pay.
Iraq last year rejected a UN offer allowing it partial oil sales to
pay for urgent humanitarian needs, saying the conditions violated its
sovereignty.
Marcus said Iraq, which used to import medicine worth #300m annually,
had not received any medical supplies on a commercial basis since
sanctions were imposed.
He claimed that the sanctions had caused one million deaths. He said
mortality rate among children was now 93 per 1000 live births, up from
26 prior to sanctions.
Marcus said the British Government refused to issue an export licence
for a #100,000 shipment of tablets though his ministry had obtained an
import licence from the UN sanctions committee.
''They are playing games. The victim is the innocent civilian,'' he
said.--Reuter

Moscow, Wednesday
RUSSIAN troops sealed off the two biggest remaining rebel strongholds
in Chechnya today and started moving into one of them, Gudermes,
Interfax news agency reported.
Seizure of Gudermes and Shali would give the Russians, with their
superior firepower, full control over eastern Chechnya.
''In the next few days we plan to take these cities without serious
destruction,'' said Anatoly Kulikov, commander of Russian troops in the
breakaway region.
Gudermes is Chechnya's second biggest town, 30 miles east of the
shattered capital Grozny. Kulikov said both Gudermes and Shali were
surrounded.
''On Wednesday, the Interior Ministry troops, after presenting an
ultimatum to the leaders of bandit groups based in Gudermes, started to
disarm them in the town itself,'' Interfax said.
Six Russian servicemen had been killed and 11 wounded on Tuesday in
operations to tighten the noose around Gudermes. It described rebel
losses as heavy.
Tass quoted a senior Russian counter-intelligence officer as saying
agents had freed 12 Russian soldiers held as hostages by Chechen
fighters.
It quoted Lieutenant-General Igor Mezhakov, deputy director of the
Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, as saying the agents had led the
hostages from mountain villages to Grozny across enemy territory. He
gave no details.
Moscow's forces took Grozny in February after weeks of fierce fighting
that left most of the city in ruins and killed thousands of people, most
of them civilians.
The Russians have refrained since then from moving into Chechen
strongholds in efforts to restrict their own losses.
But last week they took Argun, nine miles east of Grozny, by shelling
it heavily, encircling it and moving in.
The seizure of Argun was a clear boost to the Russians.
Once they sweep the rebels from the plains of Chechnya, the fighting
is likely to move to the mountains.
0  On Tuesday Kulikov ruled out fresh peace talks with the fighters of
separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev unless they surrendered. The rebels
have dismissed the demand.
Kulikov was quoted by Interfax as saying Chechen fighters had lost
most of their heavy guns, their command structure had been disrupted,
and their reserves were dwindling.--Reuter

Bujumbura, Wednesday
A DAY of dialogue and shuttle diplomacy has damped down Burundi's
political and ethnic crisis, but it may prove no more than a
breathing-space.
''It appears the crisis is over for the time being,'' one diplomat
commented tonight.
The Hutu-led ruling party and the Tutsi-dominated army had apparently
agreed to try to rein in militants on both sides of Burundi's ethnic
divide.
''Of course this is not a long-term solution but until the next
flare-up, I believe the trouble is over,'' the diplomat said.
It was the first positive signal since a massacre of Hutus in the
capital Bujumbura last Friday fuelled fears that Burundi was going the
way of neighbouring Rwanda, where up to a million people were killed in
ethnic slaughter last year.
The diplomats warned, however, that extremists on both sides were
still beating the drums of ethnic hatred and that the current calm in
Bujumbura might be only temporary.
Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo announced a plan of action today to
halt the killing. He called on Hutu and Tutsi politicians to lead by
example and work together above their partisan interests in the name of
peace.
He also said he would work to revive provincial government, disarm the
people, and reconcile the two tribes at grassroots. But he added he
would press ahead with plans to create Tutsi villages for displaced
people forced by massacres to flee to camps.--Reuter

Tokyo, Thursday
THE chief of Japan's National Police Agency was shot on his way to
work this morning. He was in a serious condition in hospital, police
said.
Takaji Kunimatsu was shot six times as he was leaving his home by an
attacker riding a bicycle. The attacker, who used a shotgun, was wearing
a black coat and a surgical mask to cover his face.
The attack comes as police are investigating the deadly nerve-gas
attack on Tokyo's subways that killed 10 people and made more than 5500
people ill last week. It was not clear if today's attack had any
connection with that incident, however.
Although no one has claimed responsibility for the subway killings
last week, it is believed they were directed at police since all of the
subway trains that were gassed were to have stopped at the station next
to the National Police Agency.
There were no immediate claims of responsibility for today's shooting.
As head of the National Police Agency, Kunimatsu is the nation's top
police official.

New York, Wednesday
IT now appears newborn babies can rid themselves of the Aids virus.
Researchers say they have found the first well-documented case in which
a child showed unmistakable evidence of being infected with the virus
within two months of birth, only to have the virus disappear from the
body by his first birthday.
The child, now five years old, shows no signs of the virus. The
findings are published in tomorrow's New England Journal of Medicine.
It may explain ''why over 70% to 80% of infants born to HIV-1 infected
mothers escape infection'', researchers at the UCLA School of Medicine
in Los Angeles said in a study.

A WRIT for damages has been served on the comic actor, Stephen Fry,
for leaving his West End play after a slating from critics.
Mr Fry's solicitors said that they would defend the breach of contract
action from the producers of Cell Mates, which could take two years to
come to court.
The actor quit Cell Mates last month just three days after it opened,
and the show later closed. He returned to the UK last week and checked
into an exclusive London clinic, the Cromwell Hospital.
Solicitors Campbell Hooper, acting for Duncan Weldon's Triumph
Proscenium Productions, claimed that Mr Fry's ''dramatic'' departure had
a disastrous impact on ticket sales, forcing the show to close two
months early, on Saturday.
Mr Fry's solicitor, Mr Anthony Julius, head of litigation with
Mischcon de Reya, said: ''We will be defending and prove that they are
not entitled to damages.''

Kingston, Wednesday
OPPOSITION leader Edward Seaga confirmed today that he had cancelled
plans for a national opinion poll on whether he should remain leader of
the Jamaica Labour Party, a move that has opponents crying foul.
The former prime minister, under fire from factions within his party,
had agreed to abide by the results of a party referendum and a
nationwide poll on his leadership.
Seaga, who has served as party chief for 19 years and led the nation
from 1980 to 1989, received about 78% of delegate votes in a March 26
leadership referendum on Sunday He said the vote vindicated him and
there was no need for a poll.
''Anybody else who wants to raise this argument,'' Seaga said after
the votes were counted, ''meet me on the floor of the (November party)
conference.''
But the group of 11 senior JLP leaders who launched the challenge
demanded today that Seaga go ahead with the national poll. Two privately
commissioned surveys this month found nearly half the electorate
believed Seaga should resign.
In addition, Seaga's JLP opponents said just 70% of the JLP's 2800
delegates voted on Sunday. They said a number stayed away out of fear of
intimidation following reports of fraudulent voting in some areas early
that day.--Reuter

PRESTWICK airport is planning to launch a cheap scheduled air service
to London this September. The hurdles are to gain Government approval
and reach a satisfactory deal with one of the London airports.
''We have identified an airport and we have identified a fare
structure,'' said Mr Matthew Hudson, chairman of PIK Ltd, which operates
Prestwick. ''There are only two things preventing this from being more
than a proposal.
''One is getting a financial arrangement with the airport, and the
other is getting route approval.''
Mr Hudson, who is to chair the air session at today's high-profile
Scottish Chambers of Commerce transport conference at the SECC, in
Glasgow, will not say which airport or airline will be involved in the
service.
Stansted, however, must be the favoured option. As well as offering
favourable rates to attract airlines, it is uncrowded and has a
35-minute train service to Liverpool Street station.
Irish airline Ryanair already uses both Stansted and Prestwick,
operating scheduled services from Scotland to Dublin.
Winning approval to operate an internal UK service would be within the
spirit, if not the letter, of rules liberalising the air industry in
Europe.
Any scheduled London service from Prestwick would compete for
passengers with the three airlines operating from Scottish Airports, a
BAA subsidiary. British Airways and British Midland fly from Glasgow and
Edinburgh to Heathrow, while Air UK flies from both cities to Stansted
and Gatwick.
Stansted, along with Heathrow and Gatwick, is also a BAA airport, but
it has a lot of spare capacity. BAA airports are operated by
wholly-owned subsidiary companies, and it is unlikely that BAA would
want to block a deal with an airline flying from Prestwick.
Competition from the new service would be mainly for the leisure
passenger.
Perhaps for that reason, the airlines did not beat a path to Mr
Hudson's door. ''I wrote to the chief executives of four airlines and
said Scotland was not doing as well as it should in tourism,'' he said.
''We invited them to tender for a service to London. We wanted a
five-year deal. We would supply everything on the ground, and charge per
passenger. If they flew empty they would pay us nothing.
''But we wanted the right fares and, if the planes filled, they were
to put on more flights and not put the fares up.
''Two airlines did not bother to write back. One wrote back and said
my letter was presumptuous -- which it was. The fourth airline wrote
back and said: 'Good -- let's go'.''
If the experience of the Dublin service is repeated, a new London
service could take off. . Latest figures from Prestwick show the number
of passengers on the Dublin route from Glasgow to Prestwick airports is
three times what it was before Ryanair began its service a year ago.
Aer Lingus, which had a monopoly on the Dublin route, has seen its
market share fall to 36%, but its passenger traffic has increased by
12%, partly due to lowering its fares to compete.
Ryanair has maintained its #55 Dublin return fare, introduced when it
started operating from Prestwick last year. Meanwhile, Aer Lingus has
introduced several fare offers starting at #69. Last year the standard
fare was around #120.
In a special supplement on transport with The Herald today, Mr Hudson
argues that Scottish industry, especially tourism, is still handicapped
by restrictive air fares.

EXCLUSIVE By MARGARET VAUGHAN
THE German artist who is the new owner of Eigg spoke for the first
time yesterday of his plans for the island. Mr Marlin Eckhard Maruma
will arrive in Scotland this weekend to outline to worried islanders his
vision of a thriving community based on ''soft'' tourism, improved
crofting and forestry cultivation.
In an exclusive interview with The Herald the new owner, who bought
Eigg for #1.5m from controversial laird Mr Keith Schellenberg, said he
was appalled at descriptions of him as a mysterious mystic.
''I want to reassure the community on the island that their needs will
come first. As they get to know me, they will understand that I am a
friend to them, not an eccentric laird or whatever. I am not a hippy
mystic.''
Speaking from the Maruma Centre in Stuttgart, Mr Maruma said he was
not the weird artist portrayed but a professor of architecture and art.
He had long dreamed of buying an island and helping build a thriving,
self-sustaining community. He said: ''As soon as I set foot on Eigg last
year I knew it was exactly the place I was looking for.''
The first step in his long-term plans for Eigg was to meet with the
islanders this weekend to try to allay their anxieties, which he said
were understandable.
Following several years of conflict with Mr Schellenberg, after
relations between the laird and the islanders broke down, the 75-strong
community had been bracing itself for confirmation that the final stages
of the sale had been completed.
Mr Schellenberg is retaining ownership of the manse and a bothy on the
7000-acre island, even though he described it as ''a bit like being on
the North West Frontier''.
Mr Karen Helliwell, secretary of the Eigg Residents Association, said
the sale was in the overall interest of the community.
Meanwhile, local MP Sir Russell Johnston yesterday called on the
Government to take such fragile communities into public ownership.
Speaking in Inverness Sir Russell condemned the way that islands like
Eigg could be bought and sold without any consultation whatsoever.
He is to seek assurances from the new owner on behalf of the
inhabitants of the island. But ultimately he thought the State should
shoulder a responsibility in such cases.

LEADERS of Unison, the public services union, have failed to win
support for a strike against local government funding cuts.
The union had balloted its 20,000 members in Strathclyde for backing
for a one-day strike to protest at Strathclyde Regional Council's
funding being reduced by #107m by central Government.
Despite union fears it would lead to 5000 jobs being lost, and
services to the public being cut drastically, the leaders disclosed they
had secured the backing of only 3888 rank and file members for the
strike.
They denied their members were apathetic and blamed members'
reluctance to strike on their fears of losing their jobs in the run-up
to local government reorganisation.
Some 19,702 ballot papers were sent out, but only 8172 returned, with
4278 voting against industrial action. In percentage terms, the vote was
52.4% against with 47.6% in favour.
The union had targeted Tuesday April 4, two days before the shadow
local elections, for its day of action when it proposed lobbying the
Scottish Office.
Last week when it announced the ballot, the union had been in
confident mood. Mr Martin O'Leary, Strathclyde Unison branch publicity
officer, said: ''The Tories have cut local government to the bone in
recent years. There is now nothing left to cut.
''Unison members see the cuts to the elderly, the young and the
vulnerable at first hand and are disgusted and angry about it. Enough is
enough.''
Yesterday the union leadership was left to reflect that its faith in
the anger of its foot soldiers had been misplaced and that it might be
out of touch with them.
Mr Gerry Crawley, publicity officer, said: ''The branch is
disappointed with the result but the lobby of the Scottish Office will
go ahead.''
Union leaders had predicted thousands of Strathclyde members would
take to the streets of Edinburgh to show that Unison would not accept
the cuts without a fight.
Mr Crawley had to admit yesterday: ''The numbers involved will be a
lot less now after the vote. About 1000 will be there with colleagues
from Unison in Lothian.''
Mrs Denise McArdle, service conditions officer, who was with Mr
Crawley at a news conference in Glasgow, said the ballot for a strike
had been a very risky option to start with.
She denied that the membership in Strathclyde was apathetic and laid
the blame for the fact that fewer than 50% had bothered to vote on the
fear of losing their job. She said: ''The main reason is local
government reorganisation. People are very frightened for the future. It
is more fear than apathy.''
The union said it had not ruled out a future day of action.

What's in a name? After 111 years the Royal Scottish Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children launched its new name, Children 1st,
at the Mitchell Theatre in Glasgow yesterday. Its chief executive, Mr
Arthur Wood, said it would focus on prevention of cruelty in future.
During the Orkney inquiry Lord Clyde had criticised the RSSPCC's methods
in interviewing the nine children taken into care. Subsequently the
charity's annual income had fallen from #2.7m to #2m, a trend that
renaming could help to reverse. Picture: PAUL HACKETT

ONLY four family members attended a simple private cremation service
yesterday for alleged mass murderer Frederick West.
The service at Canley Crematorium, Coventry, lasted only five minutes
before his coffin, carrying a single wreath, was reduced to ashes.
The mourners were led by West's electrician son Stephen, 21, who had
made the funeral arrangements.
There were some tears, according to the Rev Robert Simpson of St
Mary's parish church, in the Gloucestershire town of Newent -- only a
few miles from West's birthplace village home at Much Marcle.
The service consisted of two short prayers, the reading of the 23rd
psalm and a period of reflection, said the vicar.
He added: ''The relatives were clearly upset, as any grieving relative
would be. Although it was not a very emotional service there were some
tears.''
Mr Simpson said the mourners were headed by Mr Stephen West and
declined to say who else was present. But it is understood that they
also included West's daughter Mae, 22.
Stephen and Mae collected their father's body from the city mortuary
at Birmingham on Monday. It had lain there since he was found hanged on
New Year's Day in his prison cell at Winson Green prison.
A full inquest has yet to be held into his death. He was on remand
facing 12 murder charges in connection with the Cromwell Street inquiry.
His body had been formally released by the coroner, Mr Richard
Whittington, for collection by Ms Anne Marie Davis, 30 -- West's
daughter by his first wife, Catherine, who was said to be one of his
murder victims.
The Crown has since dropped the 12 murder charges. They had said his
victims included his step-daughter Charmaine, eight, and his daughter
Heather, 16.
His second wife Rosemary, 41, is now in Durham prison. She is to stand
trial at Winchester Crown Court in the autumn charged with 10 counts of
murder.
The removal of West's body from the mortuary appeared to spark off a
row as family members claimed they had not been informed.
West's brother Douglas claimed that neither his wife, Christine, nor
Anne Marie knew that the body was being collected. Speaking from their
Much Marcle home yesterday, both said they had not known about
yesterday's service.
They said they were ''upset'' as they would have liked to have been
present, adding they would be contacting Stephen.
Residents at Much Marcle have voiced opposition to plans to have
Frederick West's body or ashes buried at the parish church of St
Bartholomew in the heart of the village.
West's parents, Walter and Daisy, are already buried in the adjoining
churchyard and he apparently expressed a wish to be buried with them.
Mr Simpson said that he was asked to take yesterday's service by a
local undertaker and had discussed it with Stephen.
Mr Simpson said that he had no second thoughts about holding the
service for West.
The vicar added: ''A funeral service is a solemn and difficult
occasion, and this was slightly more difficult than most.''

TWENTY-FIVE striking Bulgarian seamen occupying a Klondiker berthed in
Lerwick harbour, Shetland, were given a stay of execution by a judge
yesterday.
Lord Cameron ruled at the Court of Session that the men, who claim
they are owed about $200,000 in back pay, were not entitled to remain on
board the MV Rotalia if asked to leave by the owners.
The owners, Bourgwells Ltd, were entitled to occupy the vessel
unhindered by the crew.
The judge added, however, that, before any further action was taken to
evict the crew, they should be given time to consider an offer of
$60,000 made by the owners as part settlement of the pay claim and the
costs of repatriation.
He added that there was an opportunity for both sides to get together
to resolve the dispute.
The court was told that Bourgwells Ltd, shipowners and charterers
based in London's docklands, bought the Rotalia, a stern trawler and
fish factory, from its previous Bulgarian owners, Okeanski Ribolov, for
$400,000 earlier this month.
Following a dispute with the previous owners over wages, the crew had
gone on strike and taken possession of the vessel at Lerwick.
Bourgwells has already obtained a court order, banning the 25 men from
obstructing a new crew from taking control of the Rotalia, and is now
seeking an order to have the 25 removed from the vessel.

A DETECTIVE constable who played a key part in the West inquiry is to
face disciplinary proceedings over an allegation that she tried to sell
her story for up to #1m.
Gloucestershire police confirmed yesterday that there would be a
hearing to decide if WDC Hazel Savage had been guilty of ''discreditable
conduct''.
She has not been suspended from duty.
WDC Savage, 50, was awarded the MBE in the New Year's Honours List
after a career spanning 30 years. Her Chief Constable, Mr Tony Butler,
said that she had had ''an exceptional career'' in the front line of
operational policing.
She had been a detective since 1968 and commended for police work on
five occasions.
A Gloucestershire police spokesman said that the policewoman had been
charged yesterday.
The charge arose from an investigation by Wiltshire Constabulary. No
date had yet been fixed for the disciplinary hearing. Nor had it yet
been decided whether the Chief Constable himself would conduct the
proceedings.
A spokesman for the Gloucestershire Police Federation said that WDC
Savage vigorously denied the charge.
He added: ''It has been decided that the matter is one that should be
properly heard at a disciplinary hearing.''
The Federation, he said, would continue to offer all support to ensure
a satisfactory outcome for WDC Savage.
WDC Savage's role in the inquiry into the Cromwell Street killings has
not been revealed but it is known to have been pivotal to the
investigation which led to mass murder charges against builder Frederick
West and his wife Rosemary.
It has been reported that her persistence led to police search teams
digging at the house and garden at West's home and the discovery of nine
sets of the remains of women and girls.
WDC Savage made national headlines in January after a Sunday newspaper
allegation that she had tried to sell her story for up to #1m in a book
deal.

THE consultation process on the controversial Criminal Justice
(Scotland) Bill was condemned as a sham yesterday in Edinburgh.
Critics claimed the contents of the proposed legislation would not
improve the delivery of justice in Scotland and the Bill represented ''a
missed opportunity''.
One particular concern of those who gathered at a press conference
organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Council
for Civil Liberties as part of a ''week of action'' was a failure to
deal with the issues involving miscarriages of justice.
Lawyer Mr John Scott, of the Edinburgh Bar Association, said that in
England the review of the criminal justice system was ''all encompassing
and thorough''.
''In Scotland it has been haphazard to say the least. In England the
review was independent. In Scotland it was done by Government.''
Mr Scott maintained there were proposals in the Bill designed to
increase the number of convictions.
''Even without these measures there can be no doubt there are a number
of people in prison in Scotland at present who were wrongly convicted.
This Bill will do nothing to reduce the number and may well add to it.''
He said an amendment had been proposed to the Bill calling for the
immediate setting-up of a Criminal Cases Review Authority similar to one
in the south.
He called for an independent review of the entire criminal justice
system. ''What we have had so far is not good enough. The English system
deserved a Royal Commission. So do we.''

SCOTTISH broadcasting journalist Mr Jack Regan has died in hospital
during a heart operation. He was 53.
Jack Regan was one of the BBC's most authoritative Scottish voices. He
joined the BBC in 1971 as a reporter with Reporting Scotland. He
switched to radio in 1976 and returned to Glasgow in 1977 to work in
current affairs.
He later worked in London before returning as head of news and current
affairs, radio, a post he held for five years before deciding to return
to front-line broadcasting.
After he suffered a heart attack earlier this year, surgeons in
Edinburgh fitted a replacement heart valve. He began to plan his return
to work, but suffered a chest infection and was taken into Glasgow Royal
Infirmary. It was during further surgery there that he died.
Mr Regan is survived by his wife, Katie, and their five children.

IT doesn't take you long to understand why Gordon Currie is referred
to by his staff as Hurry Currie.
Gordon Currie has always been in a hurry since the days during the
Second World War when he raced to the local butcher's shop to grab first
place in the queue.
Since he took over as the Scottish regional director of the Graham
Group 20 months ago, Gordon has taken the turnover from #52m to #74m,
and aims to reach the #100m mark by the start of 1998.
To reach this target Gordon Currie plans to expand the plumbers
merchant in the direction of bricks and mortar.
''Seventy per cent of our business is still supplying plumbers. We aim
to hold on to this business, but to build up the heavy side supplying
building material such as bricks, blocks, and roof tiles,'' he
explained.
Despite the growth in business, Gordon does not believe in keeping his
customers waiting and promises to give any customer who has a legitimate
complaint about how they were treated #10 for their trouble.
''I hate standing in queues so I don't see why our customers should
have to,'' said Gordon. ''And I'm glad to say that since I arrived here
we have given away less than #1000 to customers.''
Gordon Currie was for many years a tenor with the Motherwell and
District Operatic Society, and he has sung in more than 40 of its
productions. His busy schedule, however, has meant he has had to give up
this leisure activity.
But he has kept up his interest in Burns. ''I've always been a Burns
enthusiast. I like his ideas about how life should be lived. I was
invited to speak at five Burns suppers this year, which was a record for
me.'' Next year the Graham Group in Scotland will hold its second Burns
supper, and Gordon plans to do the Immortal Memory.
The Scottish region of the group now accounts for 19% of the company's
turnover and Gordon, who describes himself as a nationalist with a small
n, admitted: ''I find it especially satisfying when my sales team
produces results that put the regions in England in the shade.''

HAVING practised the business (or profession, as it is now known) of
public relations in Scotland for over 25 years, I never ceased to be
amazed by the number of new, so-called PR practitioners that arrive on
the scene each year. Nor am I surprised at the number of PR
practitioners who disappear off the scene each year.
In Britain today there are approximately 48,000 people engaged in
public relations yet, surprisingly, less than 5000 are members of the
industry's professional body -- The Institute of Public Relations.
Similarly, there are more than 1800 public relations companies and
consultancies registered as businesses in Britain, yet only 150 of those
are members of the Public Relations Consultants Association. One can
assume the usual 10% ratio for Scotland.
Both these industry groups have established criteria for membership
and have the kind of strict professional codes of practice one has come
to expect from legitimate industry organisations.
So what is public relations?
The IPR's formal definition is: Public Relations Practice is the
planned and sustained effort to establish and maintain goodwill and
mutual understanding between an organisation and its publics.
More recently, the Institute's of Public Relations' council approved
additional definitions which may be more meaningful to today's
management, who view the reputation of their organisations as being
closely linked to performance and quality.
The new definitions are: Public relations is about reputation -- the
result of what you do, what you say and what others say about you.
Public relations practice is the discipline concerned with the
reputation of organisations (or products, services, or individuals) with
the aim of earning understanding and support.
So what is it about public relations that makes football managers,
housewives, local politicians, journalists and many others with no
experience, automatically believe that they can provide a professional
service?
I think part of problem is an uneducated market; a market which
believes that public relations is either all about media communications
or that it is somehow connected with smart lunches and dinners that cost
a small fortune yet deliver little value. Alternatively, it is sometimes
viewed as a cheap form of advertising.
Yes, it is easy to set up in the PR business. There is a low entry
price -- a room, a PC, a fax machine, a telephone and there you go.
Sadly, many companies that employ unregistered public relations
companies or consultants actually believe they are receiving a
professional service and value for money.
''Sour grapes'', I hear those who are unregistered or unqualified say.
I challenge any and all so-called PR practitioners to deliver the full
and comprehensive range of services that are required to guide and
manage a company's corporate reputation.
Belonging to the Public Relations Consultants Association or the
Institute of Public Relations has nothing to do with the size of an
organisation but it has a lot to do with performance, credibility and
the achievement of professional practice.
In Scotland, the Public Relations Consultants Association has
established a national group of 11 consultancies, all of whom are
qualified and registered by the Association and each abides by the codes
of conduct.
There will be those unregistered consultants who claim that this is
nothing more than a quango. To them I have this to say: If they are as
good and as professional as they claim to be, why are they not
recognised by the industry's professional body? Why do they reject codes
of conduct which, members are expected to adhere to before being allowed
to practice?
A major challenge facing any corporate body wishing to engage or
employ a public relations consultant is the issue of commercial
sensitivity, trust and confidentiality. Unregistered consultants are not
governed by any rules on this subject. Members of the industry
associations willingly and freely sign agreements that guarantee, in
law, that all information of a confidential nature is respected and
retained.
Unfortunately, all too often the issue of public relations is the
responsibility of someone down the line in an organisation's management
structure, rather than being the responsibility of the chief executive
or the board. And, all too often, the corporate reputation of many
companies is undervalued until it is too late.
0 My advice to anyone considering appointing a PR consultant, is to
check that they are recognised by the industry bodies and to check their
references with existing and past clients.
Public relations is an investment, not a luxury.
I would like to think that the days of the rogue PR operators are
over. Sadly, they're not. It is the responsibility of all professional
public relations practitioners to propagate the policies and standards
of the Institute and the Association. Equally, it is the responsibility
of those who buy public relations services to ensure they deal with
professionals.
* Tony Meehan, managing director of TMA Communications, Chairman Elect
of the Scottish Public Relations Consultants Association and a Visiting
Professor at Glasgow Caledonian University, was talking to Yvonne
Wightman.

Harry Conroy tunes in to the Scottish recording scene and finds
traditional music enjoying a fling
RONNIE Simpson has been around the Scottish music business for a long
time.
For the past 15 years he has been managing director of Lismor
Recordings, the largest Scottish recording label with artists such as
Kenneth McKellar, Moira Anderson, Isobel Buchanan and Runrig having
recorded material on the label.
Lismor was formed in 1973 but Ronnie Simpson did not take a stake in
it until 1980, coming to the company via the unlikely route of the
Apollo centre in Glasgow and Minsky's disco.
Lismor's niche is Scottish traditional music with its largest selling
album being Scotland -- the Pipes and Drums which has sold 75,000 copies
in five years.
At present there is an upsurge in interest in Celtic music with a
younger audience being drawn to it through bands such as Capercaillie
and Runrig.
Lismor produced Runrig's first album in 1978, and smiles Ronnie
Simpson, ''It is now selling better than it did then''.
He recognises that in the real world it would be impossible for Lismor
to fully develop a band's talents world wide.
''We normally sign an artist for an album with the option of a
second,'' Ronnie explains.
If the albums prove successful, the performers are often signed up by
one of the large London based recording outfits.
An example of this was the Wolfstones. The band made their first album
with Lismor in 1990, and after producing a second album, they were
signed up by an American record label, Green Linnet. Wolfstone are now
growing in popularity and are at present on tour in the US.
Ronnie Simpson also has high hopes for Rock Salt and Nails, a Shetland
band whose second album with Lismor hits the record shops next month.
The band plays traditional music with a country rock twist and have
tours in Spain, Germany and Holland lined up.
Lismor with a turnover of #1m may be small compared to the giants of
the music industry but their CDs and tapes are sold in 52 countries with
their exports to the US running at #300,000.
Another big export market for Scottish traditional music is Germany
where, says Simpson, the presence of the British Army created a market
for the sound of the pipes and drums.
For the past 10 years Lismor have have had a presence at MIDEM, the
music industry's equivalent of the Cannes film festival, and held in the
same location.
''There is a growing interest in our type of music,'' he says, ''and
we are now looking at licensing our products abroad. We have had
enquiries along these lines from Slovenia, Germany, Taiwan and France.''
One Lismor artist who is attracting attention world wide is Paul
Mounsey and his Nahoo band. Paul was signed up by Lismor despite the
fact that although he comes from Irvine, he at present lives and works
in San Paulo in Brazil.
''His brother brought us a tape Paul had made, and we liked what we
heard,'' explains Simpson.
Paul recorded an album in Brazil, and he is at present making a video
which will help to promote a single Lismor plan to release.
Lismor like all recording companies live in the hope that one of their
records will reach the number one slot, but Ronnie Simpson is a realist
and does not hold his breath waiting for it to happen.
He points out that this year already record companies in Britain have
already released 2,786 albums.
''The public don't realise that every week 200 singles and 300 albums
are released, and the people producing them believe that they could have
a hit on their hands.
''We can't compete with the big boys who can produce 10,000 copies of
a single as a marketing tool, and virtually give them away to the record
stores.''
But despite the odds against having a hit record, Ronnie is optimistic
about the future of Lismor Recordings and Scottish music in general.
''There is a growth pattern which has been steady. Perhaps within a
couple of years we may see a turnaround and the new-style Celtic music
could find a place in the world wide market.''
The hi-tech recording studios are also playing their part in subtly
adding to the sounds of the traditional pipe band music.
The fastest selling Lismor album is at present The Shotts and Dykehead
Caledonia band whose latest recording was released the same day they won
the World Championships.
''We used synthesizers when making the album but you have to be
careful not to interfere with the music,'' he explains
Lismor are now looking to expand their export business which at
present accounts for almost a third of their sales. To do this they are
considering opening up offices in other parts of the world and
completing more license deals.
Their first overseas office is likely to be in Canada and Ronnie
Simpson plans to go there in the near future.
Lismor employs a staff of 10 but their activities help to create jobs
in other sectors.
An album costs #15,000 to produce and Lismor bring out around 30 each
year. ''We don't have our own recording studios so we use about 20
studios in a year. Photographs have to be taken for the album, the
inlays designed and printed then the tapes or CDs have to be made. Our
CDs are made in England, but everything else is produced in Scotland,''
he says.
On the jobs front Ronnie sees a steady expansion over the next few
years but if that elusive hit record appears then who knows what will
happen.

A STRONG underlying performance in difficult conditions last year by
Coats Viyella, Britain's largest textile and clothing group and biggest
supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer, was well received in the market though a
good deal of interest now centres on its overseas expansion plans.
Earlier this week the company disclosed it had sold the bulk of its
yarns and fabrics business as part of its strategy of focusing on its
core businesses of thread, clothing, home furnishings, fashion retail
and precision engineering where margins and return on assets are higher
than those of divested interests.
About nine years ago, though, the former Coats Patons part of the
group could have taken a very different path, becoming part of Dawson
International which has just announced substantial textile job cuts and
ousted its chairman Sir Ronald Miller and managing director Nick
Kuenssberg who was formerly with Coats Patons.
With Miller still at the helm then, Dawson made a bid for Coats which
was accepted by the board. However, two weeks later this was trumped by
Vantona Viyella and accepted.
Dawson sued on the grounds that Coats had contracted with it to sell
but lost the action, the ruling being that the company had a duty to act
in the best interests of its shareholders.
Almost 10 years on, the merged Coats Viyella, under chairman Sir David
Alliance and group chief executive Neville Bain, has a clear idea of
where it is going though nobody would deny conditions are tough in the
textile industry in some areas and there have been a few traumas on the
way.
Dawson, meanwhile, is having to pick up the pieces. Its disastrous
foray into the US is believed to have been triggered by its failure to
acquire Coats.
Last year, Coats Viyella achieved an 18% rise in profits before
exceptional items from #129.1m to #152.4m on sales up 6% at #2588.5m.
The headline figure drops from #150m to #105m after #51m of charges
relating to the sales of the fabrics, yarn and carpets business.
Shareholders are to receive a final dividend of 5p lifting the total
6.3% from 8p to 8.5p on headline earnings per share up from 11.3p to
14.6p.
Sir David commented: ''In a year when external conditions in many
markets were generally unfavourable, it is pleasing to report
improvement in our turnover and operating profit, and a very substantial
increase in headline earings per share.
''Confidence remains high for the remainder of the current year.''
With the benefit of disposals, Coats Viyella's gearing has been
reduced, strengthening its ability to invest. It is not just looking to
achieve a substantial expansion of its clothing operations in Europe but
also in the Far East, including the opening of clothing factories in
China, where it already has operations producing thread.
The group's thread activities last year improved operating profits
from #82.6m to #86.2m, helped by strong cost-cutting action in Brazil.
Turkey was adversely affected by devaluation early in the year, hitting
not just currency translation but the level of demand.
In Europe there was a general improvement in performance. Good results
in most markets in Asia Pacific were offset by weakness in Hong Kong.
Clothing dipped from #32.6m to #30.4m after sales were hit be
unseasonally warm weather in Europe as well as depressed consumer
confidence and a technology changeover.
In retail fashion, incorporating the Jaeger as well as the Viyella
brand, profits advanced from #9.1m to #10.8m despite, again, suffering
suppressed demand due to the weather in July and August.
Conditions improved from September and the year finished with a record
December. There were notably strong performances from UK Menswear and in
Asian markets.
Elsewhere, Dynacast precision engineering, the third-largest
contributor but likely to be come second after thread in the current
year following the #65m purchase of US company Bace Manufacturing,
improved from #24.2m to #28.2m.
So far as the outlook is concerned, Coats Viyella says that 1995 will
be a year of development and growth from the strong base already
established and is confident of making strategic and financial progress.
Opportunities for organic growth continue in the important emerging
world economies and the company considers itself well placed to take
advantages of these. Improving conditions in many mature economies will
help and ''modest acquisitions'' to strengthen the group are also in
prospect.
The shares firmed 3p to 193p where they sell at 13 times historic
earnings and yield around 5.8%, which seems fair enough for the moment.

THE dollar was out of favour yesterday after the Federal Reserve left
interest rates on hold on Tuesday, although comments from the US
Treasury on the need for a strong, stable dollar helped it to recover
some ground. There was also talk of support from the Bank of Japan after
the dollar approached post-war lows against the yen.
The publication of a larger-than-expected drop in US new home sales in
February unsettled the markets as they appeared to rule out higher US
interest rates.
Elsewhere, sterling was sidelined for much of the day but followed the
dollar lower. It ended over two pfennigs lower against the mighty German
mark at DM2.2209 but rose almost a third-of-a-cent against the poor
dollar to $1.6095. Sterling's trade-weighted index lost 0.2 to 85.2.
The US currency's woes did nothing to upset US equities which powered
ahead. The strength of Wall Street in turn acted as a spur to UK
equities, and the FTSE-100 index closed 14 points higher at 3142.3.

STRONG growth in automotive markets in the UK, Europe, and the US
helped Pressac Holdings to more than double its interim profits to #1.4m
compared with #684,000 previously. Earnings per share grew by 95% to
3.1p and the interim dividend was raised by 29% to 0.9p.
Group turnover rose by 46% to #23.8m helped by a 1[1/2]-month
contribution from McGavigans of Glasgow acquired in December for #9m.
There was good growth in almost all product categories and further
margin improvement is expected in the second half.
McGavigans contributed sales of #2m and profits of #121,000 in the
first half. Having carried out a thorough review of the McGavigans
business, Pressac's chief executive Geoff White said he was pleased with
the business.
There are no plans to cut McGavigans workforce of around 300. Mr White
sees scope for joint marketing and manufacturing between the two
companies which produce products for motor manufacturers. This should
enable Pressac to further increase its market share with the major
European and US motor manufacturers because many of them seek to reduce
their supplier base.
Pressac's telecom division is benefiting from strong growth in demand
for connectors from cable operators. It is due to launch a new dedicated
cable product is May. In the first half, turnover grew by 40% with
exports accounting for 17% of sales.
Elsewhere in the group, turnover in the lighting division fell by 2%,
reflecting weak UK demand for neon lighting although car manufacturers
are beginning to show some interest in the products. However, sales grew
in the smaller non-core engineering and wiring divisions.
Pressac shares dipped a penny to 107p. Forecasts for the full-year
profit centre around #4.5m compared with #2.2m in 1994.

THE good times appear to have returned to recently troubled printed
circuit board manufacturer Prestwick Holdings, which yesterday announced
its return to the black, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Executive chairman Archie Coulson, who assumed the role of company
doctor last year, pledged to return ordinary shares to the dividend list
as soon as possible.
A High Court ruling in December, approving elimination of the deficit
on distributable reserves, has eased the passage toward this. However,
preference dividend arrears will have to be repaid first.
Pre-tax profits of #411,000 in the six months to January 29 reflect a
#2.36m turnaround on a loss of #1.95m in the first half of the company's
last financial year.
The previous year's figure was hit by exceptional costs of #1.49m
relating to continuing and discontinued operations.
In spite of its best first-half showing for five years, shares in
Prestwick Holdings were unmoved at 24p.
The Ayr-based company sells primarily to the automotive industry but
its circuit boards are also used in mobile telephones, computers and the
industrial field.
Prestwick Holdings is increasing its workforce by 60 to 590 to cope
with growing demand. New investment is outstripping depreciation.

<HEADLINE>Only a question of linguistics preventing parties coming together says Irish premier.  Sinn Fein talks 'possible in 48 hours'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979140875</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government yesterday stalled on Ministerial talks with Sinn Fein
by demanding clarification of the republican negotiating position. But
Irish premier John Bruton said the differences were linguistic and talks
might start within 48 hours.
Sinn Fein was hoping for talks by the end of the week, after giving a
formal response to Government conditions for a Minister sitting at the
table. But Downing Street last night said the Northern Ireland Office
was writing back to seek further information.
The sticking point is believed to be Sinn Fein's demand that any
handover of IRA weapons should be linked to a ''demilitarisation''
involving the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British Army.
The Government has firmly rejected the link and told Sinn Fein it will
not talk on that basis.
Earlier this week, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams seemed to take a step
in the Government's direction by appearing to acknowledge that the issue
of decommissioning weapons need not be directly related to
demilitarisation.
But a senior Downing Street official said: ''I am not sure that has
been reflected in the exchanges between the Northern Ireland Office and
Sinn Fein.''
In Brussels, the Taoiseach, Mr John Bruton, said that the differences
remaining to be clarified were merely ''linguistic''.
Sounding optimistic, the Irish premier said he believed direct talks
between Sinn Fein and the British Government would go ahead very soon.
''The differences are now comparitively minor, issues almost of
linguistics. It will be possible to bridge the gap -- the distance is
not great,'' he said.
Pressed, he added: ''It might be within 48 hours -- it might take a
bit longer.''
Mr Bruton counselled observers of the peace process to remember the
long-term nature of the framework document which, he said, was the issue
of crucial importance.
''The political parties need time to allow themselves to get a genuine
perspective on the matter. A certain space is needed for this
perspective to develop,'' he said.
In Brussels for talks with the European Parliament's centre-right
coalition, Mr Bruton told a conference that the emerging peace in
Northern Ireland was ''part of the legacy of Europeans striving to find
a way to live together in peace after years of conflict.''
Meanwhile, in Belfast yesterday, Political Affairs Minister Mr Michael
Ancram said he would make no predictions about when a breakthrough would
be made.
''There are communications taking place between Sinn Fein and
ourselves at this moment, and until they are concluded I can make no
predictions.''
He said the Government was intent upon ''trying to ensure it has an
agenda which is clearly understood by both sides and which will allow
for serious and constructive discussion of the issues, which it has set
out as being necessary for the involvement of Ministers''.
''At this stage those conditions have not been concluded,'' he added.
It is understood that Sinn Fein's Mr Martin McGuinness and Government
officials were in telephone contact in a bid to iron out their
differences.
Mr Ancram was speaking at Stormont after a second round of
face-to-face talks with the fringe loyalist political groups, the Ulster
Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionist Party.
He condemned the continuing attacks by loyalists on prison officers,
and won assurances from the parties that they would do their best to
have the assaults halted.
Mr Ancram warned that if they continued or escalated, the Ministerial
talks could be scuppered, and said the attacks ''colour and poison the
atmosphere'' in which the Government was trying to take the dialogue
forward.
Asked what would happen if the attacks escalated, Mr Ancram said: ''We
made it clear that the maintenance of the ceasefire has to be an
essential part of the backdrop to exploratory dialogue taking place.
''It was for that reason I raised and condemned the attacks because,
obviously, if they continue and challenge the ceasefire, it would have
an impact on the exploratory dialogue.''
Mr Gary McMichael, leader of the UDP, and Mr Billy Hutchinson, PUP
leader, said the talks -- mainly covering policing and emergency
legislation -- had been fruitful and wide-ranging.
Both sides were building up an understanding, and the parties had
agreed to do what they could to halt attacks on prison officers' homes.
The two parties will return to Stormont for more talks with Mr Ancram
at the end of next week.

SCOTLAND'S Fraser Walker will join World championship gold and bronze
medallists, Jani Sievinen and Attila Czene, and the legendary Tamas
Darnyi in a glittering 200 metres medley cast at the Edinburgh World
Challenge on Friday, April 14.
Darnyi, Olympic 200m and 400m medley champion in 1988 and 1992, has
chosen the Commonwealth Pool as the venue for his comeback following two
years in retirement.
The 24-year-old from Budapest was king of the medleys from 1985 to
'93, his swan-song being victory in the 400m medley at the European
championships in Sheffield.
Since then, Finland's Sievinen has overtaken Darnyi's mantle, and
captured his world 200m medley record in winning the World championship
in Rome last August.
With Czene hailed as the great new Hungarian hope, and Walker, the
Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, seeking the perfect warm-up before
the European championship trials in Sheffield the following week, the
race promises to be a classic.
But the 200m medley will be just one highlight. Entries have not yet
closed, but America, Sweden, Canada, Holland and the Ukraine are
guaranteed representation among the 19-nation line-up.

Lorraine Macphail, Owner Managed Businesses Department, argues for
planned PC parenthood
WHILE the PC grows in importance for small and medium-sized companies
in Scotland, a new survey released this week shows that only a third of
organisations are formally training their employees in their use.
Instead, ad-hoc training is increasingly carried out by so called
''gurus'', individuals within an organisation who have a personal
interest in technology, and who have informed themselves about the
systems that their organisation uses.
According to KPMG Management Consulting's survey of their workstation
management network, 75% of respondents agreed on the existence of these
''gurus'' but only 12% of them had incorporated them into a formalised
support structure.
Typically these individuals are spending between 6 and 7% of their
time helping colleagues with workstation support matters.
According to Lorraine Macphail who advises small and medium-sized
Scottish companies on all aspects of buying and running PCs, this could
be a major problem and may just be one of the problems created by an
unstructured approach to the subject.
''In this survey, carried out among 81 organisations across the UK
covering all major business sectors, the number of PCs had increased by
64% over the last four years, so the amount of time these people spend
solving their organisations' IT support problem is considerable -- and
it's obviously growing every day.
''While these were mainly large organisations, the smaller companies
can have equally difficult problems to address including training and
support.
''In today's competitive environment if you don't have the information
to manage the business right at your fingertips, then you risk not only
losing opportunities, but also losing business to a competitor who does,
and can react quickly to a changing market.''
At the root of many of the problems is the dilemma that while the cost
of introducing a new computers system is comparatively low, the risk
associated with choosing the wrong one is enormous.
''Companies end up failing to issue invoices on time, having irate
suppliers chasing invoices and discovering that they have stock problems
-- all because of a wrong decision when selecting a new system.
Four of the most common problems with choosing a system are:
* The system is chosen to match a preferred package of software.
* More time and thought is given to how things are done presently
instead of what is required for the future.
* Some managers and users are not consulted in the process.
* Lack of commitment.
So how should you go about choosing a new system?
Having made the decision, the first step before looking at anything
should be to agree the six to a dozen main requirements of the system
and then go through those and place them in order of importance to your
business. Give each one a relative ''weighting''.
Taken for granted that you'll never find the ideal combination of
hardware and software for the job, at least this way you'll have a
structured way of deciding which will potentially give you most of what
you are looking for.
Both management and users of the system should be involved in the
specification of the system and it's vital to get their commitment in
order for the system to work.
Everyone should understand:
* The business objectives of the new system and the benefits it will
bring
* The current system in operation
* The number of applications involved
* What the system must do and what you would like it to be able to do
* Who is involved and why.
Once this is in place, a statement of your requirements should be
incorporated into a request to tender and then sent to as many systems
suppliers as you feel appropriate.
This should also contain a questionnaire on the supplier's business
and a series of checklists for them to complete as part of their
response. When they have responded with their solutions the next stage
is to evaluate them.
Each supplier's solutions should be ranked in accordance with their
score against your requirements for the system.
The advantage of the ''weighted'' system at this stage of the process
is that it helps you focus on what is really important to your
businesses' future success rather than on simply cost, although that too
will play its part.
Having the results from this initial matching process it is best to
apply some form of cost benefit analysis. This should take into account
that some suppliers will quote a low initial price for a system and then
recoup their money through high annual charges.
Ask up front about the deal and keep asking until you are sure you
understand the implications.
''The ultimate decision is down to the company but this structured
process of choosing at least gives you a measure of confidence that you
have chosen a system for the right reasons. The other advantage of being
so careful in the process is that it sends the right messages to the
potential suppliers, who realise they are dealing with someone who has a
clear picture of what is needed.
Lorraine has significant experience of assisting with the selection
and implementation of systems in small and medium-sized companies. It is
interesting to note that the cost of this service has often been
eligible for grant assistance, which underlines the importance of the
process.
It can also sometimes provide the necessary ammunition and confidence
to negotiate a substantial cost reduction from the preferred supplier
which is a bonus.
Referring back to the new research, there is clear evidence that
organisations in the survey are spending a large part of their time
''fire-fighting'' whereas long-term goals and strategic objectives
occupy a minimal amount of their energies.
Taking a clear view of what is required when you choose a system helps
to cut out this fire-fighting and make your business better run and
better able to cope with the changing needs of customers and the
marketplace.

EDINBURGH Racers last night appealed for a sponsor to help them take
the high road to the British championship finals at Wembley next month.
Racers have decided to fly south for Saturday's play-off tie with
Cardiff Devils rather than face a gruelling, 18-hour bus journey, and
that will cost the club around #3000 for return tickets and overnight
accommodation.
But the club believes the extra expenditure will give the players
every chance of being mentally and physically fit for Sunday's home
match against Basingstoke Beavers.
The club's general manager, Alan Maxwell, said: ''We must give the
players every chance of qualifying for the British championship
semi-finals, and an 18-hour bus trip, with a tough game at Cardiff in
between, then a testing game with Basingstoke 24 hours later is not fair
on them.''
Maxwell is looking for sponsorship to help fund the trip forced on the
club by the tight play-off fixture schedule. He said: ''Edinburgh Racers
are flying the flag for the city in a national event. It would be nice
to think that an Edinburgh-based commercial enterprise would help us
take a step on the road to Wembley.''
Tuesday's opening play-off games attracted below-par crowds. Racers'
Riversdale Crescent rink housed one of its poorest attendances of the
season, lower even than Sunday's home fixture with premier division
bottom-markers Bracknell Bees.
Kirkcaldy rink officials made hurried alterations to curling fixtures,
but the attendance was down on normal, while even promotion-hunting
Paisley Pirates had to make do with a less than capacity crowd for one
of their highlight games of the season, a play-off tie with Peterborough
Pirates.
The British championship play-offs should prove the biggest
crowd-pullers of the season. Sadly, the congested fixture list -- with
the opening round of play-off games scheduled to start 48 hours after
the end of the regular season, and with little time for publicity -- put
paid to that on Tuesday night.

NORTH clubs look set to dominate Saturday's quarter-finals of the
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup, which have, miraculously, reached this stage
without disruption by the weather, and no switches of venues are
planned.
Two matches should provide close-run contests, with two others
appearing to be plain sailing, for cup favourites Kingussie and the
south's top side Oban Camanachd.
Glenorchy, toiling in the middle of division one in the south because
of suspensions, should find Kingussie far too strong at the Dell. This
tie is due to start at 3pm to enable fans to take in the other match in
Badenoch, between Glasgow Mid Argyll and Newtonmore.
Oban Camanachd, despite the absence of leading scorer Dave McCuish,
should account for Beauly at Braeview.
The two other ties are less easy to predict. Newtonmore probably hold
the edge over Glasgow Mid Argyll, who will be without two former
national players of the year -- Kevin Thain is off-shore and Allan
MacInnes is still out with a broken bone in his hand. Newtonmore's home
advantage may see them through.
Fort William's home tie with Glenurquhart should be the best of the
round, with in-form Fort having to decide who should be left out. They
have beaten Kingussie and Inveraray on their past two outings, with
their defence in particular playing well. Captain Drew MacNeil, having a
new lease of life at full centre, again is expected to contest the
midfield.
With Kingussie having suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of Fort in
the Keyline MacAulay Cup just two weeks ago, the cup looks set to
provide its most open semi-final for some time. Rumours of Kingussie's
demise are not to be exaggerated, though, and it will take something
special to dislodge them from their perch as tournament favourites.
The semi-final draw will take place on BBC Scotland's Sports Report
programme on Saturday evening at 6.15.
Outside of the cup, the match of the day is Skye's league meeting with
Lovat at Kiltarlity. The prize is a place in the top four, qualifying
for the national league next season.

RICHARD Dunwoody's agent, Robert Parsons, has dismissed rumours that
the champion jump jockey is set to leave Martin Pipe. Some bookmakers
have suspended betting on the National Hunt jockeys' championship after
heavy backing was reported for Adrian Maguire in the title race.
Speculation that Dunwoody and Pipe may split has been growing since
the recent Midlands National. Dunwoody did not ride either of Pipe's two
runners, instead partnering The Committee for trainer Homer Scott.
''I know nothing about Richard Dunwoody leaving Martin Pipe,'' said
Parsons. ''As far as I know there is nothing in the rumours.''

SCOTTISH riders will be in short supply at the Morpeth meeting on
Saturday, with most keeping their best horses for the Dumfriesshire card
at Roberthill on Tuesday.
Kevin Anderson, with two winners, a second, and a third at his local
meeting last year, has seven runners lined-up, including Jimmy River,
still to break his duck, in the Open and Border Folly in the Confined.
Andrew Parker, short of mounts for various reasons, could have a
chance on Royal Stream in the Open.
Anderson was the man of the moment with a treble -- in consecutive
races -- at Friars Haugh, winners which give Anderson a share of the
lead in the Northern Area men's championship with Andrew Parker.
Until last weekend's meeting, Anderson had ridden just two winners
this season, but maiden races are proving a gold mine for him and he won
all three divisions of the maiden on Sayin Nowt (6-1), Bit of A Blether
(4-5), and Tannock Brook (3-1).
Parker was out of luck but the veteran, Peter Craggs, took the
Confined on Worthy Spark and followed that one up with Generals Boy in
the Open.

NEXT continues to prosper despite supposed caution among consumers in
the High Street.
In the year to January 1995, pre-tax profits jumped by 46% to #107.4m.
Profits were boosted by a #13.6m part-payment for its past investment in
convertible unsecured loans (CULS) in what was British Satellite
Broadcasting.
Following the subsequent merger of BSB with Sky to form BSkyB, and its
flotation on the London Stock Exchange last year some of the CULS
liabilities were repaid. There remains a further outstanding #10m due to
Next although the timing and scale of any further payments is unknown.
However, at the trading level, sales grew by an impressive 20% to
#652.9m. There was good trading across all product categories but the
Directory was notably strong with its sales up 27%.
Sales have continued to grow by double digits in the first few months
of the new year. Confidence in its trading offer has encouraged Next to
relaunch its Interiors range in a select number of shops.
Shareholders are to receive a generous 56% uplift in the final
dividend to 6.25p taking the full-year total to 9p against 5.5p last
time. The enhanced payment was made reflecting the group's increased
profits and healthy cashflow.
Next is determined to remain competitive in the High Street and so
reduced its gross margin by 1% with a similar reduction anticipated in
the current year. However, this was offset by a further improvement in
the productivity of Next stores enabling net margins to increase. Sales
per square foot rose to #476 compared with #411 in the year to January
1994.
Servicing extra demand from existing units is more efficient in terms
of working capital than growing the store base. While Next has been
opening some new stores its selling space has been increased largely
through extensions of existing stores often where adjacent shops have
become empty.
The turnaround in the group's fortunes has been staggering. This has
not been achieved by any magic formula, according to Woolfson, but by
close attention to what its customers want in terms of attractive shops
and products and good service.
The strong improvement in net cash position reflects disposals, such
as the Grattan mail order business, and a run-down of the Club 24 debtor
book. It is in the last two years that the cash position on the Next
balance sheet has improved dramatically. The rundown of the Club 24
debtor book has continued to play its part but a significant boost has
come from the profit recovery in the High Street chain which has
surpassed all expectations.
So far, the profit recovery has been achieved with minimal investment
in working capital and capital spending which has only recently exceeded
the annual depreciation charge. On the basis of current trends, Next is
likely to remain highly cash generative in the next few years. Given its
closeness to bankruptcy in the past it is perhaps not surprising that
the board is in no hurry to spend its current cash pile.
However, it is looking to diversify in a controlled manner. It plans
to test the appeal of the Next brand in France with the opening of an
outlet at Creteil, on the outskirts of Paris in June. If this trial is
successful then further store openings in France are planned. Overseas,
Next is already trading from four outlets in the US and there are
franchise businesses in Estonia, Malta, Bahrain and Bangkok. Further
franchises are being sought in the current year.
In addition it has a joint venture with the Limited of the US to bring
the Bath and Body Works toiletries chain to the UK. Currently there are
just five Bath and Body Works in the UK. While both these avenues have
the scope to produce businesses of a scale which will be significant in
a group context, this is unlikely to be in the near future.
As a result some City analysts believe that acquisitions must remain a
distinct possibility in the medium term. However, it is unlikely that
shareholders will be neglected in terms of dividend payments.
Profit-taking pushed Next shares down 7p to 280p but that is still a
far cry from the 7p low seen in December 1990 when its was in
negotiations to sell Grattan amid rumours that the banks were about to
pull the plug.

SCHOOLS RUGBY
THE raw evidence suggests that the Scottish Schools' under-18 side
have had an unremarkable season, but they have played some vintage rugby
which has not been rewarded.
Last weekend was a case in point, when they lost 19-14 to English
Schools at Twickenham after having led 11-9.
''We won a better share of lineout ball than they did,'' claimed their
coach and former Scotland back-row forward Graham Marshall.
He was impressed with the ball-winning skills of locks Andrew Barnes,
son of former Hawick and Scotland lock Ian Barnes, and Cults Academy's
Jason White, as well as open-side flanker Nick Outlaw, scorer of the try
against England.
Marshall said: ''I'm sure a number of the players in the side could
come through as good seniors.'' But he warned: ''Coming so close against
England may put a lot of pressure on the side in the last game, a week
on Saturday, when we face Ireland. They will be very anxious to finish
with a win.''
One of the Schools' outstanding backs has been James Craig, the St
Aloysius' College wing and son of former Celtic player, Jim. Craig Jr
has run in 41 of St Aloysius' 97 tries this season, during which the
College have won 16 and drawn one of 24 matches.
In the semi-final and final of the Bank of Scotland Schools Cup he
totalled 40 points -- 16 (two tries and three conversions) against
Earlston High School, and 24 (three tries, three conversions, and one
penalty) in the final against Queen Victoria School.
The College's 44-10 win -- in their eighth successive final -- gave
them the cup for the fourth time, equalling the record of their great
rivals, Galashiels Academy.
A fifth win next year is a distinct possibility, given the high number
of boys returning for sixth year. Coach Phil Crampsey -- who was pleased
that his side won the final ''in style'' -- thinks that up to 11 of the
team could be back, including Mike Loakman, who has impressed at centre,
scrum half Nick McLeod, and prop Carlo di Cacca.
However, Craig will be leaving as will hard-working lock Steven
Robertson, who is taking up a golf scholarship in America.

A COLOURFUL new tartan, produced to mark the 1995 Cutty Sark Tall
Ships Race, which will bring a fantastic flotilla of wind-driven vessels
to Edinburgh this summer, and -- it is hoped -- a major business
spin-off, will be revealed in the capital tonight.
The distinctive design of the Leith Tartan will be seen in public for
the first time at a dinner launching a new McEwans ale, brewed for the
race participants' visit to Leith Docks from July 15 to 18.
The Leith Tartan has been designed and produced by Scotland's leading
experts in tartan and Highland dress, Kinloch Anderson, which is based
in the heart of the historic port.
It will be sported by various guests at the dinner, hosted by McEwans
as a sponsor of the sailing ships' four-day call at Leith, which is
expected to attract more than one million people to the docks.
The tartan's creator, Deirdre Kinloch Anderson, general manager of the
famous family tailors and kiltmakers business, who anticipates a boom in
business from the arrival on her docklands doorstep of the armada of
sailing ships, ranging from brigantines to yawls, is taking the
opportunity to air it personally at the dinner.
She will, however, be wearing it in the form of a long skirt, having
posed for the photograph accompanying this report only to display the
adaptability of the new tartan.
Husband Douglas Kinloch Anderson was still undecided at the time as to
his attire for the dinner. However, Anne Irons, wife of Edinburgh's
civic head, Lord Provost Norman Irons, will be commending the Leith
Tartan's attributes by wearing it married with velvet in jacket form.
The Lord Provost, who regularly wears Highland dress, is expected to
be content to don his own choice of tartan, but at least one prominent
male businessman attending tonight's event will turn up in the Leith
Tartan, in trouser form. Mrs Kinloch Anderson is quick to point out that
tartan trousers are trousers, while trews are the military form.
The Kinloch Andersons are optimistic that the Leith Tartan will be in
great demand among the crews and the many supporters and visitors their
graceful vessels will attract.
The new tartan's look and colours has many ingredients, drawn from
Leith's rich historical associations. It is based on the sett of the
Robertson tartan, aptly chosen because of the link with the name Robb,
borne by Henry Robb (Shipbuilders), which was the largest of its
industry in Leith from the early part of this century until 1983.
As for the colours . . . the tartan's ancient blue and navy symbolise
the sea and the maritime connections, the royal blue represents the
famous visit to Edinburgh of King George IV in 1822 and the Princess
Royal's presence to launch the race, the green brings to mind Leith
Links with their historic golf connections, and claret red is involved
as symbol of Leith's wine trade in the days when claret was preferred by
many to ale.

NORTH Sea oil and gas revenues hit a record level for the nineties
last month, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland, which calculates a
monthly index.
Revenues rose from #47.8m to #49m in February on the back of increased
oil output after the January storms and a higher dollar price for Brent
crude.
Gas production fell by 7% as seasonal demand eased, but oil output
advanced 3% to 2.68 million barrels a day, the second greatest volume
since March 1986. In December oil output was 2.71 million barrels a day.
The average dollar price of Brent crude rose by 3% to $17.05 a barrel.
With the dollar weak sterling oil revenues jumped 7% to a daily average
of #29.1m, their highest level since November 1990. That was in the
middle of the Gulf crisis when the price of oil averaged $33.14. Back in
November 1985 when it was $29.76 a barrel, oil revenues on their own
totalled #55m.
The combined oil and gas index fell by 1.25% last month, but the drop
can be attributed entirely to the decline in gas output. Even the
seasonally adjusted gas index fell slightly.
The bank's energy economist, Mark Shea, said: ''The oil output was
particularly impressive. Only one month has bettered the daily average
of 2.68 million barrels in the past nine years, and the last time
February's oil revenue of #29.1m a day was passed was back in November
1990.
''This is no flash in the pan. The combined outputs of the three
winter months of December, January and February show oil output running
at 13% above last winter.''
But he warned that with gas output bound to fall in the face of warmer
weather, ''we are now unlikely to break through that #50m a day figure
until the end of the year at the earliest.''
Higher North Sea oil output was a major factor in reducing Britain's
visible trade deficit from #13.4bn to #10.5bn last year. The surplus on
the oil account grew from #2500m to #4200m.
Oil and gas extraction rose sharply last year and was a major
contributor to the 3.9% increase in GDP.

NEWSPAPER group Johnston Press yesterday reported a 17% increase in
1994 pre-tax profits to a record #14.7m and expressed its delight with
the #29.4m addition of Halifax Courier Holdings.
The acquisition of its one evening and seven weekly titles, and three
newspapers in the Isle of Man which the Edinburgh-based company has put
into a separate trading unit, contributed #1.4m to operating profit
between June and end-December.
Johnston remains firmly on the acquisition trail, although it believes
major purchases in Scotland might be ruled out by Monopolies and Mergers
Commission considerations.
Its total dividend is up 15% at 2.0075p, after a final payout of
1.32p. However, shares lost 1p to 142p.
Pre-exceptional profits were up 23% at #15.3m, before a #666,000 net
exceptional loss on disposal of loss-making commercial printing
operations at St Helens and Wakefield.
Chairman Fred Johnston said the group's newspaper companies had got
off to an encouraging start in 1995, although business conditions
continued to improve only slowly.
One of the few clouds on the horizon is the rising price of newsprint.
Gearing was less than 5% at the year-end and, predicting a return to a
net cash position during the first half of this year, the company
remains in acquisitive mood.
Managing director Tim Bowdler said the question of when and what the
next acquisition would be was one of opportunity.
Leaving Johnston's options open, he said: ''Obviously we have areas
where we are currently strong and something which had synergy with our
existing operations would clearly be of interest.
''However, something which is not necessarily where we currently
operate could be of interest.''
Mr Bowdler believes Johnston, which also has a strong presence in the
north of England, would be restricted in Scotland by what the MMC would
permit.
He added: ''Given the position we have in Scotland, I think it would
be difficult for us to make a significant move.''
Johnston's sale in December of specialist magazine company Our Dogs,
which published a weekly newspaper of the same name, took the group out
of magazines as well as commercial printing.
The Halifax Evening Courier, one of the newcomers, is the only daily
title in Johnston's portfolio of more than 80 paid-for and free
newspapers. The group consequently claims to have been virtually
untouched by the national price war.
If this has had any effect, it has been in influencing people's
perception of what should be paid for a newspaper, which might have a
bearing if Johnston was considering cover price increases.
Situations vacant led advertising revenues higher, with income from
the property and motors categories also well up year-on-year.
Net assets declined from #34.1m to #32.3m during the year, although
this reflected a #25m goodwill write-off against reserves following the
Halifax Courier acquisition. This is in line with the group's general
policy of not valuing the titles of its newspapers in the balance sheet.
A share issue related to the purchase raised #16.1m and retained
profits totalled #6.9m.
Mr Bowdler was delighted with the Halifax and Isle of Man companies,
which he said had performed extremely well since acquisition and had
excellent prospects.
* PETER Davis, who resigned as co-chairman of the Anglo-Dutch
publishing group Reed Elsevier in June last year, received a #1,247,000
pay-off, according to the annual report.
He received compensation of #652,000, a #525,000 cash contribution
toward his pension and other benefits of #70,000.

GLASGOW-based EFT Group yesterday had good news about future
dividends, as it announced a 65% increase in pre-tax profits to a record
#3.35m.
The asset finance group, which acquired Blackburn-based consumer
finance company Haydock for about #9m after its December 31 year-end,
has now achieved 30%-plus growth in earnings per share for four
consecutive years.
Chairman Hamish Grossart said group revenues in the first two months
of this year were 40% ahead of the comparable period in 1994, with
record new business volumes in asset finance and contract hire. These
figures exclude Haydock, whose acquisition was completed on February 13.
He believes demand will move ahead more rapidly than last year and,
although pressures on lending margins are expected to continue, he
believes bad and doubtful debts will remain at only modest levels.
With a 17% increase in total dividend to 1.75p, after a final payout
of 1.225p, EFT has increased dividend cover to 3.8 times. Cover was
still 3.4 times, excluding a #451,000 share of a fee payable to former
executive chairman Peter Stevenson which boosted pre-tax profits.
Managing director Ted Black said dividend cover had reached a level
where future dividend growth should reflect that of earnings. EFT shares
gained 1[1/2]p to 74p.
New business lending written during 1994 was up 27% at #44m. Although
margin pressures were experienced, these were offset by increased
non-interest income from running accounts, such as arrangement and
documentation fees.
Headline earnings per share rose 68% to 6.74p, with underlying
earnings per share, discounting the exceptional credit, up 47% to 5.88p.

DEEP Bramble and Its A Cracker joined the Grand National absentee list
yesterday as trainer Kim Bailey continued to play a waiting game with
the favourite, Master Oats.
Trainer Paul Nicholls had to concede that Deep Bramble, a 16-1 chance
for the Aintree handicap, would not to be ready in time after having
having been injured in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
''He isn't 100% and the decision to miss the National was made after
consultation with the owners and vets,'' said Nicholls. ''He will come
right but not in time for Aintree.''
Outsider Its A Cracker has one or two minor problems and his trainer,
John Berry, has decided to wait for the Scottish National at Ayr.
The ground at Aintree is reported to be soft, though clerk of the
corse Charles Barnett was reluctant to forecast the likely conditions
for Saturday week.
Soft ground would suit Master Oats but connections are still uncertain
whether the Gold Cup winner will take his chance. ''I will not be making
any decision until the weekend,'' said Bailey. ''He's fine but has not
been schooled or blood-tested and I want to make sure that everything is
spot on.''
Ireland's hopes of winning the race for the first time since
L'Escargot in 1975 were given a lift when Nuaffe was reported to be in
great shape. The winner of the Greenalls Gold Cup has been given special
schooling in an effort to improve his jumping technique.
''We've been teaching him to jump from his hocks like a showjumper and
he's taken to it great,'' reported trainer Pat Fahy. Another Irish
challenger, The Committee, will be ridden by Japanese jockey Tsuyoshi
Tanaka.
He had his application for a licence granted by the Jockey Club
yesterday.

Bulgaria 3, Wales 1
MIKE Smith, the Wales manager, was disappointed last night after
having watched his side beaten in a Group 7 match against Bulgaria in
Sofia -- their fourth successive defeat -- which virtually ends Welsh
hopes of qualifying for next year's European finals.
''The players are sitting in the dressing room as sick as pigs because
they know how well they played,'' he said. ''You've got to take your
chances. We had two really good ones. The first from Chris Coleman when
it was 0-0, and then from Dean Saunders, when the keeper made another
tremendous save.
''It was just after that that they got the second and that was the
killer, particularly because it should not have counted. Penev was so
far offside we couldn't believe it -- he was virtually in front of
Neville.
''We raced over to the linesman but he just didn't want to know.''
The display by Smith's side was in stark contrast to the way they had
slipped to the embarrassing 5-0 defeat in Georgia in November.
More than 200 soldiers had been drafted in to clear the pitch of six
inches of snow which had fallen overnight. But, once Krassimir Balakov
had put the Bulgarians ahead just before the break, the writing was on
the wall for Wales.
Although Welsh keeper Neville Southall was in fine form, there was
little he could do to prevent two second-half strikes by Luboslav Penev.
Wales got the partial reward their play deserved when Dean Saunders
netted his fifteenth international goal seven minutes from the end.
Vinny Jones' brief was to follow Iodan Lechkov everywhere, and the
Wimbledon man stuck to his task. With skipper Barry Horne adding an
extra defensive shield, the home side were reduced to long-range and
over-ambitious efforts in the early part of the match.
After 14 minutes Wales should have silenced the 60,000 crowd when Ryan
Giggs floated in a corner, Jones headed back across goal, and Coleman,
four yards out, looked certain to score only for his effort to be turned
over by the home keeper.
Four Welsh players were booked, Jones, Horne, John Hartson, and Kit
Symons.

SCOTLAND'S teenagers were knocked for six on the second match of their
Indian tour -- by a bowler called Mohammed Ali.
The West District Under-19 team had no answer to the pace and power of
the youngster, who is tipped for Test stardom. He took three for 14 as
Goa romped to a nine-wicket victory in Margao.
The Scots were out for just 142 with only Glasgow Accies opener Dougie
Lockhart able to offer any real resistance with a patient 41 which
included five boundaries. To add to the misery, both Ally Lindsay and
Intikhab Ahmed were dismissed first ball.
The target proved an easy one for the Goanese, who raced to victory in
less than 28 overs. Both Kolanker Vivek and Colaso Micky hit unbeaten
half-centuries.
Scotland manager Mike Stanger said: ''There wasn't that much between
the sides, but we lost too many careless wickets at crucial times.''
Scores:
West Under-19 142 (D Lockhart 41; M Ali 3-14, K Nitin 3-17, F Seby
3-24); Goa Under-19 145 for one (K Vivek 58 n.o., C Micky 52 n.o.). Goa
won by nine wickets.
* NEW Zealand won the second one-day international against Sri Lanka
in Hamilton to clinch the three-match series between the teams 2-0.
The hosts won yesterday's rain-affected encounter on a faster
run-rate.
New Zealand batted first and made 280 for six in their 50 overs,
boosted by a superb innings of 95 from all-rounder Nathan Astle. But
rain then restricted Sri Lanka to just 31 overs, making 117 for six.
* SURREY are optimistic that Pakistan fast bowler Waqar Younis will be
fit to play for them this season.
Waqar, who has been suffering from a back injury, is expected to
arrive in England shortly for hospital tests.

THE crown of Britain's endurance running queen, Liz McColgan, lies
uneasy after almost two years sidelined by injury. Somebody is about to
pay for those wasted years, and it may not just be those who stand in
her way when she races on Sunday.
There was still an Elizabethan serenade yesterday for Scotland's
former world 10,000 metres champion as she prepared for the most crucial
race of her life, the NutraSweet London Marathon.
McColgan posed and smiled, but it was the smile of an executioner. She
knows that if she is not to be consigned to history, like the dress she
wore, then she must restore credibility by claiming the heads of at
least some of the women who have usurped her throne during her absence.
Like Elizabeth I, who had a reputation for being ruthless with her
enemies, so too with McColgan. This applies to those who cross her path
off the road as well as on it.
For her husband, Peter, confirmed they are moving closer to legal
action, as first hinted at in The Herald last October. Now there is the
prospect of litigation against three of her former associates. If they
cannot be sent to the Tower, they may yet be bled dry.
McColgan believes she has been badly served by some of her medical
advisers -- a physiotherapist and a doctor -- and that two knee
operations which she underwent were unnecessary. They extended her
absence from the sport, threatening her livelihood. One surgeon told her
she would never run again. ''I've proved him wrong,'' says Liz. ''But
I'm resigned never to running pain-free again.''
Liz's husband, Peter, confirmed yesterday: ''We are trying to get
everything documented, and are talking to two or three experts in the
field. When we have all the facts we shall sit down with our solicitor
and decide where we go from here -- if anywhere.''
McColgan has spent more than #20,000 on treatment, including regular
trips to Florida-based Irish therapist Ger Hartmann, who cured her.
Recently, McColgan parted company with Kim McDonald, her former coach
and agent, who negotiated the reputed #500,000 contract which she is
taking steps toward fulfilling this weekend.
The McColgans are unhappy that despite McDonald having said he will no
longer act for Liz, he stands to gain substantially from the two London
races she has yet to run under the terms of the deal: three London races
in four years. Three in three, it is believed, would have netted her
more. Failure to start last year may have cost #75,000.
McColgan also fell out with another former coach, John Anderson, the
erstwhile Gladiators' referee. Counter claims for damages were made and
that acrimonious parting was finally resolved by out-of-court
settlement.
McDonald told me, prior to McColgan's injury, that her earning
capacity could be in excess of $500,000 annually, with two marathons,
plus winnings, other appearance fees, and endorsements. All of that has
been on hold for two years, perhaps forever.
The sum sought in any action could be vast, and the prospect of a
medico-legal battle fills the British Athletic Federation with horror.
The physio in question regularly treats British team members
voluntarily, though McColgan's consultations with him are understood to
have been professional. ''Any legal action would have serious
implications for sport,'' warns the BAF executive chairman, Professor
Peter Radford.
''All medical cover for UK teams is provided voluntarily by
physiotherapists and doctors. Athletics, and other amateur sports, could
find themselves with no cover, and facing penal insurance premiums.''
But attritional warfare on the road is more to McColgan's liking, and
with the withdrawal yesterday of one of Sunday's biggest rivals her task
is perhaps less difficult than suggested by the odds of 10-1 on offer
yesterday.
The former double Commonwealth champion, Lisa Ondieki, has bowed to
medical advice, after having suffered an Achilles-tendon injury.
The Australian finished second, immediately ahead of the Dundee woman,
in London in 1993, McColgan's last major race and source of the injuries
she has been fighting since.
''It will still be a very competitive race without Lisa,'' said
McColgan. The field includes Germany's Kathrin Dorre, winner for the
past three years, former runner-up Renata Kokowska, and European
champion Manuela Machado.
''I'm confident about my chances. I'm fit, my training has been going
well and I'm a little bit more relaxed these days. Because of everything
I've been through, I'm not so intense. It's exciting to be back and I
see no reason why I shouldn't be right up there.''
McColgan refused yesterday to answer questions about her training but,
after Sunday's race, I believe she will confirm that she has modelled
her comeback on the high-volume mileage of the Chinese, who took away
her world 10,000m title during her absence.
AIMS, the Association of International Marathons and Road Races,
yesterday announced they had ratified as world records McColgan's
half-marathon time in Tokyo (67-11), 10,000m in Orlando (30-39), and
8000m in Washington State (24-28). If McColgan wants to add the marathon
to that, she would need to run 2-21-06. London is the course on which
Ingrid Kristiansen set the existing mark 10 years ago.

* THE stalls open this afternoon at Edinburgh, heralding the start of
another Flat racing season in Scotland, but as TOM McCONNELL explains,
the capital course is expecting a very special visitor later this year
to celebrate the completion of #500,000 of improvements at the track.
EDINBURGH racecourse, which today opens the Flat season in Scotland,
will later this summer also welcome the Queen on the first royal visit
to the 180-year-old track.
Work is well forward on the #500,000 corporate hospitality complex,
members restaurant, and bar which the Queen will officially open at the
evening meeting on July 3.
After an inspection of the improvements to the stable yard, she will
watch some of the races. A special card for the occasion, with valuable
prize money to attract good-class runners, is being prepared.
A racecourse spokesman said the facilities would benefit not only
racegoers, but owners jockeys and staff, and would make Edinburgh one of
the most attractive coures in the North.
Today's card is a ''no frills'' affair but two of Britain's most
popular and successful trainers, Jack Berry and Mark Johnston, will be
present, each with three runners.
Berry, who had 131 winners last season, tends to specialise in early
season two-year-olds, and Whicksey Perry, his runner of the opening
race, the Tuck Shop Maiden Auction Stakes, will command a lot of support
from local punters.
Johnston, who had 117 winners including Mister Baileys in the 2000
Guineas, runs Unconditional Love, but the main threat to Berry's charge
could come from the Lambourn raider, Mick Channon's Arvees, third last
time out.
Berry also is a sprint specialist and Daily Starshine, who has already
won over five furlongs, is strongly fancied in the Booker Cash and Carry
Handicap.
Johnston's main hopes would appear to be Mary's Case, in the Malt
House Vintners Selling Handicap, and Equerry, in the Family Choice
Maiden Handicap. Both partnered by his former stable jockey Jason
Weaver, now freelancing from a southern base.
Mary's Case has run four times on the all-weather and been placed on
three occasions. Equerry was a consistent two-year-old with Michael
Jarvis before joining Johnston.
Robert McKellar, former head lad at Cree Lodge, in only his second
season, and still without a winner, is determined to put that right
soon.
He sends out three runners from his Lesmahagow yard, including
Benjarong, who won at Edinburgh for Johnston last season. He also has
Serious Hurry, a 500 guineas purchase at the Doncaster Sales, and
Carondra, who was unspectacular as a two-year-old.
His former employer, Linda Perratt, without a winner over the jumps so
far, also is concentrating her energies on the Flat.
She has two runners in Sunday Mail Too, who should have run at
yesterday's abandoned Catterick meeting, and Strathmore Dream, whom she
owns and trains.
Leading Scottish jumps trainer Len Lungo transfers his attention to
the Flat with Judge and Jury, in the Gold Mark Claiming Handicap, in
which Peter Monteith has Funny Rose and Tom Kemp, Sharp n' Smooth, both
fit from hurdling.

A YOUNG Rangers XI attracted a crowd of 1500 to Central Park last
night for the official opening of Cowdenbeath's new #500,000 stand, and
the Ibrox side recorded a comfortable 5-1 victory.
Rangers took the lead after 38 minutes, when right back Neil Caldwell
clipped the ball home from 10 yards. Four minutes later, John Douglas
chipped keeper Neil Russell from 16 yards. A Lee Dair penalty after 56
minutes and a Brian Reid goal 15 minutes from time, had them on easy
street. But Cowden were rewarded with a Mark Yardley header seven
minutes from time, only for Lee Robertson to add a fifth.
* ROSS County gave their promotion hopes a boost when they defeated
Albion Rovers 4-1. They led at half-time through a Alan Duff goal, and
increased their lead when Willie Furphy scored after 70 minutes. David
Seggie pulled one back for Rovers four minutes later, but late goals
from County's Gordon Connelly (86min) and Bill Ferris (87) secured the
win.

DENMARK, the European champions, thought that they were sure to gain
the three points on offer against Cyprus in Limassol. How wrong they
were, the islanders holding their visitors to a 1-1 draw.
In fact, the Cypriots, with just two European qualifier successes in
their history, nearly clinched victory when they hit the bar in the
second half of their Group 2 match.
The Danes, with Rangers' Brian Laudrup and his brother Michael in the
side, went ahead through Michael Schionberg after just two minutes, but
the expected rout never materialised and Marios Agathocleous's equaliser
in 45 minutes was well deserved.
There was no danger to Holland in Rotterdam, the home side beating
Malta 4-0 in a Group 5 match with goals from Clarence Seedorf, Dennis
Bergkamp, with a penalty, Aron Winter, and Patrick Kluivert.

England 0, Uruguay 0
ENGLAND were branded brainless and lacking in creativity following
last night's Wembley bore. Hector Nunez, the Uruguay manager, pulled no
punches with his damning post-match verdict on England, and suggested
manager Terry Venables should get Paul Gascoigne back in the team as
soon as possible.
''England seemed to lack someone to run their team,'' said Nunez.
''John Barnes is not the kind of player who can make the team play
properly. Some brain is needed. England are strong physically but lack
ability in the last few metres of the field. They don't lack
goalscorers, but lack someone to create the chances for them.''
For Venables, the honeymoon seems to be over. Many spectators among a
34,000 crowd booed Barnes and Venables' decision to take off Peter
Beardsley was loudly jeered.
The crowd also made their point by giving Manchester United's Andy
Cole the biggest cheer of the night when he came on as a substitute
after 71 minutes for Teddy Sheringham. Seven minutes later he almost won
it for England with a header that crashed against the bar.
Venables admitted his team was below par but added: ''I wouldn't say I
was really disappointed. There were good points like the form of our two
central defenders but I can understand the crowd getting frustrated when
you fail to score.
Wembley crowds are dwindling as the fans lose faith with England's
fumblings in front of goal. They have now scored only four times in the
last five matches and Venables could not disagree with the Nunez verdict
on Gazza.
''I have never hidden the fact that a fit Gazza could be back. He is
going to help. He can give us something different.''
ENGLAND -- Flowers, Jones, Le Saux, Venison, Adams, Pallister, Platt,
Beardsley, Sheringham, Barnes, Anderton. Substitutes -- Walker, Ruddock,
MacManaman, Barmby, Cole.
* ENGLAND'S European Championship odds have been lengthened from 4-1
to 9-2 joint favourites with Germany. The Republic of Ireland are 25-1
with Scotland at 40-1.

TWO Scots will have the opportunity to put themselves in line for the
World Athletics Championships in Gothenburg this summer by finishing in
the top 25 of the World Cup Marathon Cup in Athens a week on Sunday,
writes Doug Gillon.
''We have waived the qualifying time for anyone among the leading 25
in either men's or women's event,'' said the International Amateur
Athletic Federation's spokesman, Chris Winner yesterday.
There is however no chance of a country being allowed to field more
than the customary three per event. ''Runners would still have to be the
choice of their national federation,'' he added.
Though Scotland's Karen Macleod has been pre-selected, a limited
number of athletes are likely to run under the qualifying mark of 2-35.
So it gives an additional incentive to Trudi Thomson (BTP Pitreavie) and
Alison Rose (Edinburgh Woollen Mill) who are members of the six-strong
UK team which runs in Greece.
A total of #243,333 will be at stake in the race from Marathon to
Athens, with #10,666 for the winners of both the men's and women's
races, and bonuses of #20,000 for breaking the individual course
records.
* THE Polish runner Antoni Niemczak faces a two-year suspension after
testing positive for a banned drug for the second time. Niemczak tested
positive for the stimulant ephredrine at the Tokyo marathon on February
12.
Ephedrine normally carries only a three-month ban, but Niemczak has
already been banned for two years, having used the steroid nandrolone at
the 1986 New York marathon.

comeback aimed at next year's Olympic Games in Atlanta.

A SENIOR officer of the International Amateur Athletic Federation
yesterday supported the move to bring the world cross-country
championship back to Scotland for the centenary of the event, writes
Doug Gillon.
The first international cross-country championship was held on
Hamilton racecourse in 1903, and last night the Scottish Athletic
Federation's road-running and cross-country commission agreed to ask the
British Athletic Federation to support a bid to bring it back for 2003.
Chris Winner, press chief of the sport's world governing body,
speaking from Athens, said: ''The IAAF is extremely interested in the
roots and history of athletics, and returning to these roots.
''Remembering the sport's heritage is very much in concert with their
ethos, I believe an offer to stage the 2003 championships in Scotland,
at the place where they first took place, would be viewed with
interested and sympathetic eyes.''
No approach has yet been made to Hamilton, which staged the world
event in 1952 and '60. Officials believed that would have been premature
before establishing whether the proposal had the full support of the
sport.

Local federation president Antonello Sdanganelli wrote to second

were in order.
He complimented the team on a ''thrilling match'' against rivals
Palermo last Saturday, but added: ''While the other team wore dignified

bikini bottoms which, during their athletic efforts, revealed anatomical
details whose sight tends to detract from the decency of a quality

TWENTY-FOUR Kenyan athletes yesterday urged the International Amateur
Athletic Federation to lift a four-year ban on former world cross
country champion John Ngugi for refusing a random drugs test.
The plea was made by Kenya Athletes' Commission chairman and
steeplechaser Patrick Sang and 23 other athletes, including world cross
country champion Paul Tergat, Olympic 800m champion William Tanui and
3000m steeplechase record holder Moses Kiptanui.
Ngugi refused a random test in his rural home of Nyahururu in
February, 1992, saying the IAAF test team had not properly identified
itself and was not accompanied by a Kenyan track official. The IAAF
council is due to meet in Gothenburg in May, when Ngugi's case will
receive a final hearing.

A GOVERNMENT Health Warning should accompany their calculations last
week that taxes may need to rise by 20p in the #1 following devolution.
This, it was claimed, would be to compensate for the extra per capita
Government expenditure enjoyed by Scotland.
There are serious concerns about the credibility of these calculations
on the basis of the reliability of their data, and more fundamentally on
the principles underlying them.
First, the Government's regional figures (''so-called'' identifiable
general government expenditure) are made up of expenditure undertaken to
provide services for the benefit of the residents of the region.
According to the ''Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland''
statistics, these make up under 80% of local government expenditure.
Scotland gets a relatively high share of this compared to its
population, which is not surprising given the costs of providing
services in remote areas and the relatively high levels of need for
health and welfare etc.
However, these figures exclude expenditure of national benefit such as
defence and foreign affairs. The Ministry of Defence is UK industry's
largest customer, and according to its figures its procurement budget is
considerably biased towards the South-east and South-west of England in
per capita as well as total terms in most years.
This expenditure goes towards providing skilled jobs and other
spin-offs to the local economy -- witness the local joy in the
South-west at the recent #1 billion MoD contract for Westland
helicopters. Clearly tens of billions of pounds spent upon defence
procurement over the years will have a much greater direct and indirect
impact upon a region's economy than the equivalent expenditure on social
security.
The issue of taxes raised also needs further scrutiny. The Ministers
appear to be suggesting that the shortfall between the costs of
maintaining current levels of expenditure in Scotland and the UK average
figures should be met by higher Scottish income tax, the ''20p''. If so,
then surely other revenue should be considered.
This includes revenue generated in local plants and offices but put
through the head office accounts elsewhere, together with tax revenues
from sources such as North Sea oil (greater than the Scottish Office
budget in the mid-1980s though much diminished now) and Scotland's
national drink.
This could result in Scotland doing rather well.
Also to be considered should be the differential impacts between
regions of tax breaks for individuals (such as mortgages and capital
gains tax) and corporations. (Anyone mention the London Docklands?)
If potential tax figures are to be cited then it is important that all
relevant income and expenditure be included. Otherwise the figures will
have little credibility. But this issue of misleading statistics are
overshadowed by something more important.
The Boston Tea Party showed that the principles beind taxation should
not be tampered with lightly. The apparently implied principle being
suggested is of central government expenditure within an area being
based on a per capita basis. This is of little merit.
Take an example relevant to next week's local elections. Local
authorities' largest expenditure is on education. The small rural school
at Strathblane, north of Glasgow, has a cost per pupil greater than the
average for Central Region and more than #300 per pupil higher than that
of an urban school such as Raploch. This is not because of ''feather
bedding'' in the rural school but simply due to economies of scale.
Should the new local authorities charge more council tax to all those
living in areas with high per capita service costs so as to meet the
difference compared to the council average?
This would be the logic especially if the new authorities gave
devolution, sorry decentralisation, of power to local areas in their new
decentralisation plans required by statute. I am glad to see that none
of the political parties is campaigning upon this basis.
If citizens in different regions are paying equal tax rates then they
should expect similar benefits to each other in terms of levels of
service.
The ''20p'' tax suggestion seems close to introducing a dangerous
precedent. I hope that this is not the case.

Chris McLean finds out if Estonia can teach others a lesson when it
comes to putting a little artistic temperament into an election campaign
SCOTLAND has grown used to artists involving themselves in politics.
The last General Election saw a big name show-down between Robbie
Coltrane (Labour) and Sean Connery (SNP). Many others have contributed
to the debate on Scotland's future, from Alasdair Gray and Peter Howson
to Pat Kane and Elaine C Smith.
But what if artists -- instead of lending their support to mainstream
politicians -- formed their own party to campaign on the issues they
felt most important? Not very likely under Britain's first-past-the-post
voting system, but what if Scotland achieved a Parliament, complete with
proportional representation?
That is what has happened in Estonia. The citizens of this small
Baltic Sea state voted earlier this month, in their second General
Election since regaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
They faced a bewildering choice of 16 parties competing for the 101
seats in Estonia's parliament, the Riigikogu.
Among these was a newcomer, the Blue Party, formed only last November
by a group of artists. They feared that cultural concerns were being
neglected in the country's rapid transition from communism to
capitalism. The party now has 200 members and 30 candidates in the
election.
Blue leader is Neeme Kuningas, artistic director of the Estonian
Theatre in the capital, Tallinn. Amid frantic preparations for a
performance of La Boheme, Kuningas admitted it was highly unusual --
maybe even unique in Europe -- for artists to form their own party.
''But we feel the state is not giving a high priority to intellectual
and cultural development,'' he said.
''Some people argue we should not betray the arts by getting involved
in politics -- we have been chosen by God and have a duty to use our
talent. But Estonia is such a small country that cultural leaders are
well known and trusted and can have a big influence.
''An assembly of artists in 1989 was an important step in our break
from the Soviet Union. Many of our members are the same people,
concerned that the revolution is now starting to eat its own children.
''Under Soviet rule, the main reason for Estonia's survival was our
intellectual and cultural life, based on our language. Now, the
situation is the opposite. Independent Estonia is being swamped by
Mickey Mouse and hamburger culture. Many politicians don't appreciate
the danger of losing our own cultural identity.
''The main direction of Estonia's development is right. But it is not
possible to measure everything in terms of money. The state has a duty
to protect the security of the nation. That means not only the physical
safety of its citizens, but keeping the nation alive through its
language, culture and intellectual values.''
At face value, culture does not fare badly in Estonia. The Ministry of
Culture and Education will spend some 364 million kroons (#20m) on
culture this year, over 4% of the whole state budget. But ''culture''
includes a broad range of libraries, museums, sports, broadcasting and
films in addition to the performing and visual arts.
Nor do ticket sales come near covering the cost of productions, even
though prices have risen sharply and are expensive for low-paid
Estonians. Top seats in the Estonian Theatre cost 100 kroons (#5.60),
with places in ''the gods'' just five kroons (28p).
The Blues do not specify exactly how much money should be invested in
culture. ''That depends on the success of the economy,'' says Kuningas.
But they do want a clear duty on the state to subsidise theatres, arts
centres and museums and to promote Estonian culture overseas. They also
want a Cultural Capital Fund set up outwith governmental control, and
sponsors of the arts to receive tax relief.
The message attracted media interest and public sympathy, but voters
were ultimately more concerned with prices and pensions than their
cultural enrichment. The Blues' electoral baptism was marked with a mere
0.4% of the vote. Nevertheless, Kuningas is far from despondent. He
knows the party suffered from lack of experience and resources. It was
also squeezed by the requirement -- designed to discourage smaller
groupings -- that a party must exceed a 5% threshold to win seats in the
Riigikogu. ''We may not have been strong enough this time, but at least
we have been honest with ourselves and the voters,'' he said.
''We wanted to form an electoral union to increase our chances, and we
talked to the Reform Party (who won 19 seats in parliament) about a
coalition. But they would not give us a fair number of candidates on the
joint election list. They just wanted us as a flower in their buttonhole
showing their commitment to the arts.''
That charge is rejected by Paul-Eerik Rummo, deputy leader of the
Reform Party and a former Minister of Culture. Rummo is one of Estonia's
best-known poets and playwrights.
But he thinks a separate party is not the answer. ''I am not surprised
they did not win seats,'' he said. ''They should have remained a
lobbying group, covering the whole political spectrum.''
For the moment, Estonian voters seem to agree with Rummo. But finally,
I asked Kuningas, why the ''Blue'' label? Are all Estonian artists
arch-Thatcherites? The politician-cum-theatre director assured me there
was no political significance.
''Blue is just a nice colour, the colour of Europe and the UN and the
brightest stripe in our national flag,'' he said. ''The sky is blue, the
sea is blue. And many Estonian artists feel blue about the way we are
being treated.''

Now you has... Keith Bruce checks out the Chick Lyall Quintet which is
performing all the better for some supportive public funding
LAST night's performance by the Chick Lyall Quintet in Edinburgh's
Tron Cellar was more than just the first chance for fans of Scottish
jazz to hear the latest slew of tunes by one the scene's best composers.
For the five musicians involved, it was the first date of a Scottish
mini-tour that runs until Sunday, and a chance to show off the fruits of
funding the process of making music.
The line-up that bears Lyall's name -- with Phil Bancroft on
saxophone, Morph on guitar, 21-year-old bassist John Spiers, and drummer
Iain Copeland -- is actually run by Copeland, the man behind Glasgow's
equivalent of the Edinburgh Tron gig, Basement Jazz.
By securing relatively small sums of public money, he literally bought
time for Lyall to compose the band's material and for the group to
rehearse.
Grants from the Scottish Arts Council of #800 for the writing and #750
for rehearsal were supplemented with #600 from Glasgow City Council --
an application to the Musician's Union is pending. The money has allowed
the luxury of four rehearsals of the new material, almost unheard of in
jazz circles.
With a typical drummer's flair for musical description, Copeland
describes the new music in terms of its odd time signatures (9/4 and
5/4), with some vague style guidelines that include the words ''Latin'',
''funk'', and ''ECM label''. He does vouchsafe that the line-up of the
band has meant that music has turned out very different from Lyall's
previous work.
''They're very composed pieces, not vehicles for blowing, because of
Chick's classical background, but the members of the band are all real
go-for-it improvisers,'' he said.
How that clash of styles would have worked out without paid rehearsals
is a moot point, but musicians do not usually have the time to devote to
such preparation.
He is a graphic designer, Bancroft a doctor, and Lyall teaches. The
awarding of grants to allow a group to rehearse properly towards a
series of performances is a relatively recent phenomenon in jazz.
So, too, is support for recording of anything other than
commercially-available work, but Copeland has applied for money from
Glasgow's Music Development Fund to make a live recording of Sunday's
performance by the band at the Ramshorn Theatre in Glasgow's Ingram
Street, so that it can be used as a calling card with European
promoters.
''What is still sadly lacking is product from the 'blossoming'
Scottish jazz scene,'' he said.
Copeland is administering the band through his Basement Jazz company,
and the Ramshorn is where the band and club activities overlap.
Already twice used by the Glasgow International Jazz Festival for the
organised chaos that constitutes the Clandemonium weekend events put
together by Phil's drummer brother Tom, Copeland now plans to put the
Ramshorn on the map as a year-round jazz venue.
Sunday's gig represents a trial run for the new club -- relocating
from the 13th Note in Glassford Street. It will start in September and
run on Fridays all the way though to June and the 1996 jazz festival. As
well as featuring the best Scottish bands, Copeland expects to promote a
London-based artist -- like saxist Ian Ballamy or Tim Garland -- with
his band, Lammas, every month or so.
Again it is the new climate of funding that has made such plans
possible. The shift away from the concentration of the arts council's
music budget in the hands of Scottish Opera and the orchestras has
hardly been seismic, but it is detectable. Basement Jazz has development
funding for the next three years of #5500 a year.
At the same time, the city's commitment to music, following its year
as Sound City, means that there is a clear structure for funding
applications. The move to the Ramshorn has met with approval in city
council circles, overcoming some difficulties the licensing board had
with the small basement club.
With that core funding in place, the attraction of commercial
sponsorship becomes easier, and an enterprising private-sector company
could do worse than tie its name to a year-round jazz venue.
Copeland hopes that he can attract sufficient cash to ease the burden
on himself.
He said: ''I'd like to be able to take on a young person who wanted to
learn the arts administration business. There is a clear need for a
properly set-up jazz organisation in Glasgow which can fill the gap
between pub gigs and bigger promoters like Assembly Direct.''
* The Chick Lyall Quintet is at the Lemon Tree, Aberdeen tonight and
the Ramshorn Theatre, Glasgow on Sunday.

SEA-BATHING and sea-water baths used to be the great attraction at
Seamill Hydro on the bracing Firth of Clyde coast just a mile or so from
the pleasant little town of West Kilbride.
A sandy beach and white-tipped breakers are a mere stone's throw from
this old-established, privately owned hotel, and these are inviting
enough, even on a grey March morning. But with the recent completion of
a luxurious new leisure and fitness centre, hotel guests are now spared
the uncertain rigours of tides and sea breezes while taking a plunge or
indulging in healthy exercise.
Seamill has long offered old-fashioned comfort and personal attention
to its guests. It's the sort of hotel where visitors return from year to
year and can expect the staff to remember their names and the particular
rooms they like. Now, in addition, hotel guests can enjoy the very
latest in health and beauty programmes, all centred around a deliciously
warm, beautifully designed and spacious swimming pool.
There's a sauna and steam room adjoining the pool, and a turbo pool
and aqua lounger. For those guests wishing a more energetic programme,
the new hi-tech gym provides all the latest in body-shaping and general
fitness equipment. You can work on shaping up all parts of the body
under expert supervision in the new gym, where you will be given a
fitness programme to suit your own individual needs.
Fitness aside, many people feel better (and are told they look better)
when they have a glowing tan, whether it be summer or winter, and
Seamill's ''Stand Tan'' system is a unique concept of unisex tanning
which is not only faster, but also more hygienic.
There is an extensive range of facial and body treatments too on offer
at the hotel, for men and women. They include vitamin and revitalising
facials, various slimming programmes and either back, neck and shoulder
massage or full body massage.
After a swim or relaxing sauna you can go to the new, adjoining Pladda
Lounge for a drink or a snack where you can enjoy open, uninterrupted
sea views with Arran in the distance, and watch the steady progress of
the ferries which plough regularly between Ardrossan and Brodick, the
island's capital.
The Pladda is the name of the lighthouse which was built on the little
pear-shaped island of Pladda on the south-east corner of Arran, in 1790.
A day-trip to Arran is still one of the most popular attractions for
Seamill Hydro guests, but there are many others too. The hotel caters
for families with children of all ages, as well as for businessmen and
women. Holiday activities are arranged at the hotel for children between
two and 14, and there's a baby-listening service so parents can relax
without worry.
Pony-trekking is available in the area and there's the nearby working
farm of Blackshaw, which is very popular with children. But if you are a
golfing enthusiast you can opt for nine or 18 holes of golf at nearby
West Kilbride Golf Club
The hotel's romantic seaside setting makes it an obvious choice for
weddings as well as family holidays or business meetings. Receptions for
50 to 350 guests can be arranged and Seamill takes a pride in seeing to
all the careful details which make a wedding there a memorable one --
from the red carpet to the fresh flowers, cars and photographers.
Sample menus for celebratory lunches and dinners, or evening buffets
are available and Seamill's general manager, Colette McCann will be
happy to show you round the various reception rooms and to discuss
individual requirements.
Last month the backdrop for one wedding was a spectacular snow scene,
but all seasons here have their attractions. And the new fitness and
leisure centre certainly adds an exciting new dimension to Seamill,
which has had a long-standing reputation as a healthy, happy
establishment.

Ideal stress-free location
MANY city-based businesses choose Seamill for their meetings and
conferences not only because it is reasonably close to Glasgow, but it
is also situated in a stimulating environment which is highly conducive
to productive thought and discussion.
At Seamill you can be sure that you will end your conference with the
same number of delegates as when you started. They are not likely to be
lured away by the bright lights of the city while the tranquility and
scenic beauties of the Ayrshire coast -- with its invigorating qualities
-- are exceptionally good for a memorable conference.
Apart from offering luxury accommodation and some of the finest
cuisine on the south-west coast of Scotland, Seamill Hydro caters for
the businessman in a highly professional manner. Every member of staff
is interested in the success of your conference and each strives to
cater for your every need.
Conference rates for one-day non-residential meetings, 24 hours or
longer, are extremely competitive and include buffet lunches or
four-course table d'hote dinners and morning and afternoon coffee and
tea, with many thoughtful additional touches.
The hotel will take care of all the technical details in order to
ensure a smooth and successful meeting and this means everything, from
flip chart easels, screens and projectors, VHS video recorders and in-
house bleeping paging systems to complete office facilities. A
conference office can be arranged and equipped with photocopier, word
processor, typewriter and telephone and includes secretarial services.
There are 70 bedrooms in all, in the original building and the new,
luxurious addition has 18 suites that take up to six persons. A great
deal of time and effort has gone into the interior design of all the
bedrooms to make them pleasing to the eye and to offer each resident
luxurious comfort during their stay. All feature private bathrooms, TV,
direct dial telephone, hairdryers and tea and coffee-making facilities
and trouser presses.
The suites in particular are very popular with businessmen and women
but it should be noted that non-participating spouses or partners can
also take advantage of highly competitive rates at the hotel -- whose
staff will be delighted to arrange any number of tours or other
activities during meeting hours for those ladies and gents who are not
actively involved in the conference.
Possibly the best way to end a strenuous or stressful day's conference
or seminar is to spend an hour or two in Seamill's new leisure club
where all the splendid facilities are completely at the disposal of
delegates and their partners. The pressures of the day simply float away
when you relax in the pleasant and therapeutic dry heat of the sauna,
while an overactive intellect can be soothed by a dozen or two lengths
of the pool.
If pent-up aggression is a problem, the answer could be an arduous
burning-up session in the gym, though it has to be said that a relaxing
game of snooker over a few drinks in the bar might seem a more
attractive proposition to some.
Private bar facilities can easily be provided in one or all delegates'
rooms but Rhody's Parlour, which boasts a fine selection of malt
whiskies is open from 11am well into the wee small hours.

''ARE you going to come back to Newcastle?'' In a post-performance
question-and-answer session it was clear that Mark Morris's style of
dancing had, yet again, surprised, delighted and touched a whole new
audience.
It's not hard to see why. Morris's choreography is full of sublime
moments of lyrical, affecting movement (as in New Love Song Waltzes),
alongside the ridiculous and sentimental, as in the slyly funny Going
Away Party. Both are studies of love and romance.
The Brahms -- already seen at an Edinburgh Festival -- sweeps couples
together in sudden pairings that are tellingly short-lived. No matter
how tender, how passionate, how in step they appear to be, these
twosomes fragment.
In Going Away Party -- being given its British premiere -- the stuff
of life (loving and losing) is strutted to the country sounds of Bob
Wills and his Texas Playboys. Here loneliness is a state bigger than the
Lone Star State itself, as a partnerless Mark Morris goes through all
the right moves -- sassy steps from hoe-downs -- but still gets left in
the dark.
Earlier, he shimmied his way through Three Preludes, a solo set to
Gershwin that captures the volatile, heady mood of an era. Morris knows
how to fit steps culled from other styles of dance into the very marrow
of the music he uses. He and his company bring these steps on stage in a
spirit of generosity, of sharing with an audience.
This is a performance which is, for all its panache, impressively free
of ego-tripping and empty showing-off. Edinburgh Festival-goers can look
forward to a fourth appearance by Morris and his company this year.

PLAYWRIGHT Phyllis Nagy says she became fascinated by a spate of
unexplained disappearances in her native New York State in the summer of
1991. The question of why someone should take leave of their daily
responsibilities, slip out of sight, perhaps to re-emerge in a new place
with a new identity is an intriguing one.
I can't feel, however, that Nagy's Disappeared, a Mobil Prize-winning
play, performed here by Midnight Theatre Company in association with the
Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, either asks the question very successfully
or really begins to answer it.
It's interesting that it should turn up at the Traverse straight after
the in-house production of Marisol (it moves to the Tron, Glasgow, next
week), because both plays tune into a contemporary New York neurosis, a
kind of pressure-cooked collective identity crisis, that seems one step
removed from our own experience. Throughout this long production, there
is never an emotional justification for us to feel concerned about the
disappearance of Sarah Casey -- though she is played ably by Alexandra
Gilbreath -- the woman-in-the-bar who is there one scene and gone the
next.
Nagy switches her attention to a social misfit -- Kerry Shale doing
his best Jeff Goldblum impression -- who may or may not be responsible
for the girl's disappearance. But he is only as interesting as an
oddball can be, and sheds little light on to the play's deeper themes.
Despite a shoddy looking set designed by Tim Shortall and a deadening
lack of movement in Derek Wax's direction, there is enough pace to the
language and momentum in the acting to keep us tagging along but, being
abstruse rather than intriguing, it really does try the patience.

PERHAPS it is the social rite of passage involved in moving from
motherhood into matriarchal figurehead, which has required
mothers-of-the-bride to either dress as dragons or insipid wallflowers.
Either way the choice of mother-of-the-bride outfits has tended to be
as limited as the conventions surrounding the bridal gown.
While brides were called on to fulfil some fantasy of a fairytale
princess, mothers seemed to be pigeon-holed into being knight-slayers in
fuchsia and toning florals -- all the better for keeping the groom in
line. Other mothers-of-the-bride, uncomfortable with that kind of role,
seemed to go for quiet wallpaper dressing in ephemeral pastels which
faded out before your eyes.
But just as the choice for brides is widening to reflect the
individuality of their own personalities, the options are becoming
better for women who are no longer prepared to dress ''over-the-hill''
for what should be one of the most joyous occasions of their lives.
One of the biggest breakthroughs has been to allow
mothers-of-the-bride to be as radiant as the bride in whites and creams,
which, until recently, was taboo for wedding guests. This year there is
also the introduction of a more flattering palette of tones, which are
neither overpowering nor insipid, with watercolours which are more solid
than fluid and pastels with backbone.
Instead of drowning in solid blocks of strong colour or fading away in
washed-out blues and pinks, colours this year are quietly effective.
Bouncing baby blues and plush peaches are the kind of colours which
are being espoused by such labels as Condici and Oliver James, which
offers a good range of unstuffy designs in larger sizes.
Peach in particular is a colour which flatters a range of skin tones,
although it may be better avoided for those with darker or olive tones.
It also sits well in a range of fabrics from solid cottons and linens
through to chiffons and voiles. In other words, it is a colour which
performs well either with crisply tailored designs or with more frothy
variations such as a straight jacket enlivened by a flouncy chiffon
skirt.
Another winner this summer is light yellow, which -- given the right
weather conditions -- will shine like a beacon of light, setting the
tone for a warm-hearted and fun occasion. Personalities should always
come into the equation, however, and it is perhaps not the best colour
for mothers who expect to be moved to mountains of tears by the event.
Monotone black and white can be sharply striking and unforgettably
chic in its simplicity and has the added attraction of being almost too
easy to match up with those essential extras of hats, shoes and bags.
Summertime baby blues and pinks are implicitly youthful and cool on the
hottest of days.
In terms of style, two-pieces dominate the market with jackets which
not only tone but are part and parcel of the outfit. By and large the
trend this spring is for nicely tailored jackets reflecting the tighter
lines of the season with waists which are offset by this year's other
essential, the pencil slim knee-length skirt.
The gradual erosion of convention means MOBs need not be limited in
their options. Hemlines and where they sit are no longer cast in stone
and as the market generally has the choice of whether they want to wear
their skirts long, on the knee or micro-pelmet style, so does the MOB of
today, although few would want to wear an A-line mini for their
daughter's big day.
A smart sparsely patterned sarong wth a toning jacket, such as the
Jacques Vert Plus lines, can be transformed into a stunning summer
wedding outfit by the simple addition of a hat. It will then live to be
worn another day for a range of occasions.
With the high cost of clothes at the middle to top end of the market,
consumers are of course increasingly conscious of the need to buy
outfits which can be used after the big day. The Tricoville Group
represents a good cross-section of choice ranging from its fluidly
styled Parigi label to the lighter Jour and the individual details of
its del'Arte sector.
Trousers, once frowned upon for any female guest at a wedding, are now
on the edge of being acceptable for MOBs.
This season the best bet is wide pallazzo pants which can gracefully
flow from the church or the registry office on to the dance floor at the
reception. Light fluid viscose and acetates have given these pallazzos
greater elegant draping than ever before, producing trousers which are
inherently feminine and suitable for the grandest of occasions.
Straightforward one-colour suits are also good buys this season for
MOBs. Colours outwith the standard bridal spectrum include dusky and
sensual pinks as well as the generally available beiges and ecrus which
have held the high ground for the last couple of years.

TENANT farmers anxious to buy the land they rent from British Coal
claim the prices being demanded are making it impossible for them to bid
for holdings which represent both their homes and their livelihoods.
One family had previously made inquiries about buying its holding and
been quoted a valuation of #90,000, but under the current disposal
programme British Coal has come up with a price of #170,000.
At a meeting in Fife tonight some 27 farmers will compare notes on the
offers that have been made to them and will receive professional advice
from a land agent and a solicitor on whether the British Coal figures
are out of line with normal expectations.
Robert Nelson, who farms 240 acres of British Coal land near Culross
in Fife, said the prices being sought equated to 25 or 35 times the
annual rent. ''That puts it way out of the price league for most of us.
''We understand that institutions buying farmland would normally
expect to pay between 10 times and 13 times the annual rental value.''
That figure would, however, take account of the fact that the land
purchased had a sitting tenant.
''They are supposed to be excluding from all calculations any
improvement carried out by the tenants and we feel, at this stage, that
it is possible the discounting exercise has not been done correctly,''
said Mr Nelson.
The discrepancy between the tenants' idea of an appropriate value for
their land and the British Coal valuations is the latest hurdle in an
exercise which has been fraught with problems from the start. Initial
indications were that tenants would not be considered as bidders because
British Coal wanted to dispose of its landholdings in one lot.
Since then 45 tenants have been asked to indicate if they are
interested in purchase and 14 have been informed that the land they farm
will not be sold to them because it is considered to have development
potential -- mostly for housing. In some cases there have been offers to
sell holdings minus the land considered to have development
possibilities.
''The sad thing is that all of these tenanted farms are family-run
units,'' said Mr Nelson. ''People have been there for generations and
they are simply trying to buy their homes -- and their livelihoods.''
The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation has put together a special
financial package for British Coal tenants, and while it has received a
number of applications from England and Wales it has had none so far in
Scotland.
James Hepburne Scott, AMC's Scottish manager, said British Coal was
seeking a high price for the tenant right on its land. A freehold price
equivalent of 60%-70% of what the farm might have raised on the open
market without a tenant could be a considerable burden for a
tenant-purchaser who was having to borrow money.
''I think a lot of tenants will come to the conclusion that they are
being asked to pay too much money,'' he said. ''They will sit it out
just now and keep their powder dry and see what happens second time
round.''

ADAPTED, directed, and designed by Jon Pope from the prose piece by
Dostoevsky this Citizens' Theatre Company play hammers home the message
''just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get
you''.
While civil servant Jacob Golyadkin (Brendan Hooper) is clearly acting
in a bizarre fashion -- driving round town in a crested carriage and
hiding in a dirty broom cupboard before gatecrashing a high-society
party -- it is also undeniable that those around him are behaving oddly
too.
When a doppelganger appears on the scene Jacob's colleagues and his
servant Petrushka act as if this is nothing untoward, their nonchalance
exacerbating Jacob's anxieties. So, is Jacob unhinged, is he the victim
of a conspiracy, or is he imagining the whole business?
Dostoevsky's ambiguity is accentuated in Pope's production, where
Beatrice Comins and Michelle Gomez, visitors in the night, are
supercilious narrators whose appearance constantly fluctuates; from
period corseted gowns to futuristic silver trenchcoats, changing into
sober dresscoats at a point when Jacob's sanity is most in doubt.
Pope has fun dropping little hints that challenge the status quo but
the symbolism is irritatingly over-emphatic, with Comins and Gomez
distractedly playing out voodoo rituals while in character as Jacob's
doctor or boss.
Quirky touches like the doppleganger (Eric MacLennan) presenting Jacob
with a musical card which plays La Bamba and imitating the National
Lottery pointing finger are amusing but dreadfully pointless and Pope's
tongue-in-cheek approach tips the play into a wilful obscurantism which,
while visually engaging, is -- until a final, successfully chilling
moment -- vapid.

BRITAIN's horticultural industry revealed itself to be in a confused
state at yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons Agricultural
Committee in London.
However, one bright light was turned on as Michael Thomson, managing
director of the Tayside-based Scottish Soft Fruit Growers, claimed this
sector was now on an upward curve following the production and marketing
debacle around the turn of the decade.
''We are not going to be sitting here waiting for the train to hit us
as we were in 1989,'' he said, referring to misunderstandings of
production trends in central and eastern European countries at that time
which led to a collapse of major parts of the Scottish sector.
He admitted to MPs that dependence on trade information had misled the
industry and producers had failed to get their act together. However,
this was being addressed and market intelligence systems improved.
Lack of communication within the industry as a whole was demonstrated
when both Food from Britain, the Government-backed export marketing
agency, and the industry's professional body, the Institute of
Horticulture, revealed they were planning promotional agencies to help
close the #1700m a year trade gap -- one of the worst in the food and
drink industry.
Peter Thoday, president of the institute, told MPs the proposed new
promotion body, Prohort, was still at an exploratory stage. Feedback
from producers was mixed, he admitted to Paul Marland MP, but there were
some strong voices calling for unity. He stressed that the new
producer-funded body would be promotion oriented and not a political
lobby group.
Quizzed by committee chairman Sir Jerry Wiggin MP, Patrick Davies, FFB
chief executive, admitted a lot more could be done in terms of import
substitution. But FFB's role had changed to export promotion.
Sir Roger Moate MP pointed out that in its written evidence FFB
appeared to be calling for a body similar to Prohort -- ''Not the
happiest title'' -- while there were strong indications that other
countries were tackling the job more successfully.
''I feel we should work with those producers and growers who are
seriously thinking about exports, not those who are simply trying to
fill gaps,'' said Mr Davies.
''Supermarkets in the UK have established quality standards that are
the envy of those abroad and have ensured demand for these products
abroad. British producers have concentrated on supplying the home market
but there are many opportunities to supply outlets overseas.''
However, he later admitted that of the 280 companies and organisations
so far approached by FFB only 10 had indicated any support.

ONE positive outcome of this show running behind schedule was a
bigger-than-expected audience for the excellent support, Apollo 440.
Their superb live takes on their own single, Lolita, and Blue Oyster
Cult's Don't Fear The Reaper, showed an ability to transfer studio
trickery into a captivating mix of guitars and technology which in many
ways was more effective than the repetitive and formulaic components of
the headliners' set.
It's a mere four years since ''The EMF'' were emblazoned across Smash
Hits, inducing much screaming from teenage girls, and leading another
abortive ''British invasion'' of the US.
Now, keener to impress their laddish credentials on the readers of
Loaded with ever more unlikely stories of debauchery, substance, and
self-abuse, their music has failed to mature in the way that the recent,
flute-driven single Perfect Day and the more pensive Patience promised.
Not that EMF doubt their own credentials. Singer James Aitkin
introduces them as ''legendary'', the single as ''a perfect song'' and
Inside as ''an old classic''. The reality is that their set is as light
in melody as it is heavy in guitar, and strangely, the pop sensitivity
of their older singles, notably Lies and I Believe, win out over the
trawls through Cha Cha Cha material.
Markedly, for a recently major band, the small venue is not sold out.
For all the energy both on stage and in the front few rows, EMF are an
exceptionally soulless live experience. As their technical ability
improves, the dumb pop appeal of their early work seems remote, leaving
the impression of a band swimming manfully but unsuccessfully against a
growing wave of apathy.
At least the pseudo psychedelic stage projections were engaging.

William Russell finds one director successfully playing it safe with a
costume drama while another takes a chance which pays off with a
flawless piece of work
COSTUME dramas dominate this week. The Madness of King George,
directed by Nicholas Hytner, is far and away the better film, but
Immortal Beloved, directed by Bernard Rose, a turgid biopic, is the one
with a moment of true cinematic inspiration.
Hytner, celebrated in the theatre and the opera house, a first-time
film director, handles his actors brilliantly but in cinematic terms
plays safe. Rose, however, in what is basically a bodice ripper about
Beethoven, comes up with that genuinely breathtaking moment.
It occurs when the aged composer recalls how, as a boy, he ran away
from his bullying father and went for a midnight swim. The camera looks
down on the boy's pale, naked body floating in the dark waters of a
lake, pulls slowly back to reveal the full moon and stars reflected in
the water, and, as the Ode to Joy explodes on the soundtrack, the boy
gets smaller and smaller until he is lost in the Cosmos.
The plot is based on an unsent letter, found after Beethoven's death,
which said: ''All my music and all the capital of my estate shall go to
my sole heir . . . my Immortal Beloved.'' Who was she? There are plenty
candidates for the role, since Beethoven was one for the ladies and his
secretary, Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe), has a little list.
Beethoven's life story is told in flashback as Schindler interviews the
three women Rose has opted for.
They are a pouting Italian beauty and former pupil, Julia Guicciardi
(Valeria Golino), a Hungarian aristocrat with a limp and a natty line in
gipsy clothes, Countess Anna Marie (Isabella Rosellini), and his
brother's wife, Johanna (Johanna Ter Steege), an upholsterer of easy
virtue.
Gary Oldman, looking just like one of those white plaster busts of the
great composer, stomps about afflicted with ever-increasing deafness in
a terrible temper treating everyone abominably while a selection of
Beethoven's greatest hits, conducted by Sir Georg Solti, are played in
the background. Oldman never gets the space to develop the role, and
while Prague provides some handsome locations, the film demonstrates
once again that Europuddings are invariably indigestible stodge.
Hytner's film, written by Alan Bennett, who has done a masterly
adaptation of his own play, opens with a splendid sequence in which the
George III is dressed by his flunkeys in the robes of state while the
court assembles for a mad dash down the corridors of power to
Parliament. It sets the tone of the ramshackle, protocol-bound world in
which nobody dare look the King in the eye.
Nigel Hawthorne, who created the role on stage, gives the performance
of his career, scaling down the effects he must have had to play broadly
for the theatre so that they register with the camera. It is a flawless
piece of work and he gets fine support from Helen Mirren as Queen
Charlotte, Ian Holm as Dr Willis, the physician who cured his alleged
madness, and Rupert Everett as the Prince of Wales waiting impatiently
in the wings.
The drama is provided by the clash between father and son, the man
with nothing to do -- being Prince of Wales is not a job, but a
predicament -- and the man with the job who suddenly finds himself
unable to fill it as the apparent madness takes over. George III was not
mad, but afflicted by porphyria, a disease affecting the nervous system
which causes severe digestive pain and turns urine a deep purple.
The King's first illness, which occurred in 1788, gave the Prince of
Wales's faction in Parliament, led by Fox (Jim Carter), its chance to
try to oust the ruling party headed by Pitt the Younger (Julian Wadham).
The film focuses mostly on the King, a man struggling to keep his
balance in a world which has turned upside down. Hawthorne's Farmer
George, father of the nation, fond husband, and wilful autocrat who
expects to be obeyed, is a glorious creation, and Bennett draws
parallels with the problems the monarchy faces today with skill.
The problems are not actually the same, although we too have a Prince
of Wales in waiting who does not, so we are told, get on with his Papa.
But Bennett is not distorting history to make the parallels, simply
drawing attention to certain apparent similarities which add savour to a
tale fascinating enough in its own right.
George III, a successful ruler for most of his 60-year reign, even if
he did lose the American colonies, was popular, cultured, a genuine
collector of works of art, and a fusspot obsessed with protocol and
detail. He also tried to present to his people the facade of a happy
family life. Wave, that is what we are expected to do, he tells them at
one point, and later, recovered from his illness, he reminds the Prince
of Wales that they must be a family. That was why they were where they
were.
At the end the family, which will become the Windsors, assemble on the
steps of St Paul's and what is in front of them? That statue of Queen
Victoria. It emphasises just how long we have had the Hanoverians on the
throne. A closing caption explains that porphyria is hereditary. Poor
Prince Charles. The tabloids will be watching the colour of his urine
next instead of eavesdropping on his poser phone calls.
In Just Cause Sean Connery, a Harvard law professor from Fife --
Hollywood's excuse for his Scots accent, although it is one foreign to
the East Neuk -- is inveigled into saving a young black man (Blair
Underwood) on death row for the murder of a young girl in a Florida
prison.
Was he framed by the local sheriff, Laurence Fishburne? Did the serial
killer on death row, Ed Harris in manic form, who confesses to the
murder, really do it? Is the boy as black as he is painted? The plot is
full of holes, but the suspense is well maintained, although when Kevin
McCarthy introduces Sean as his son-in-law one's eyes boggle. Sean is
wearing and balding wonderously well, but not that well.
Allison Anders's My Crazy Life, about girl gangs in Echo Park, a
Hispanic suburb of Los Angeles, combines three stories Tarantino fashion
most confusingly. The girls, who favour purple lipstick, are a
collection of thick no-hopers with whom it is impossible to feel any
sympathy. Society may have dealt them a lousy hand, but that is no
reason for them to play it as they do.
The director of Ma Saison Preferee, Andre Techine, has made a
charming, rather slow, but worthy rites-of-passage movie, Les Roseaux
Sauvages, in which two young boys hanker after the same girl. Things get
complicated when one of the boys decides he really hankers after the
other boy, but it all ends with everyone a little older, a little wiser,
and slightly sadder.
It takes place in 1962 at the time of the Algerian war of independence
and it helps to know a little about that.

Brussels
THE British Government was put under pressure yesterday to show more
enthusiasm for European integration when senior Tories joined EU
Christian Democrats for a pan-European strategy conference ahead of next
year's Maastricht renegotiation.
Conservative Party chairman Jeremy Hanley made the least European
speech of the day. Although he talked of Britain being ''inextricably
linked'' with Europe, he concluded his text with a warning against the
''great leap forward'' school of European thought much favoured by the
Tories' Christian Democrat allies in Brussels.
Mr Hanley said: ''One thing is certain. If the inter-governmental
conference is to be a success, it cannot afford to be too abstract or
over-ambitious. Our theme must be of effectiveness and implementing what
we have agreed, not some giant leap forward.
''What we need is a thoughtful discussion on how to make the EU work
better for the citizens of Europe and how to make the EU work for the
people who now desire to join the Union.''
He promised Britain would put forward a ''positive agenda of practical
ideas" for the Maastricht revision but he made no mention of specific
issues which have split the Tories such as their allies' fondness for
faster political and economic integration including the proposed single
currency and a common foreign policy.
Although the single currency is formally not part of the Maastricht
revision, it is bound to play a significant part in inter-government
contacts in the margins of the renegotiation.
Mr Hanley also skipped mention of other big British preoccupations
such as voting rights in the Council of Ministers which the UK wants
changed to give the bigger member states more say over the growing
number of smaller nations.
His remarks were in contrast to speeches from Christian Democrat
leaders, including Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian Premier, whose
pro-federalist views have alarmed British Conservative Euro-sceptics.
Mr Dehaene, a supporter of fast-lane integration and the ceding of
some sovereignty to Brussels in the interests of more efficient
decision-making, received a measure of backing from the Irish Premier,
Mr John Bruton.
Mr Bruton said he favoured the European Union having a
directly-elected President of Europe who would represent all 15 EU
member states. He also said he was attracted to the idea of a
democratically-elected European Commission, with commissioners-designate
having to go through ratification hearings in national parliaments and
not just in the European Parliament.
This is generally in line with much thinking inside the European
People's Party, the centre-right umbrella group in the European
Parliament, which includes British Tories. The group recently produced a
working paper for the Maastricht review suggesting significant new
powers for the parliament, an elected council of ministers and a
European income tax.
Mr Major has said Britain will oppose extensive new powers for the
European Parliament.
* Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday urged MPs to unite behind
an approach to the future of Europe ''with which we can as a nation be
at ease''.
However, the divisions in the Tory Party over Europe came to the fore
almost immediately at Commons question time when a prominent
Euro-sceptic Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton South-West) described
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's refusal to see party rebels as
''insulting''.

MICHAEL TUMELTY looks at Beethoven's turbulent affairs and wonders
about the love that tormented his final years
SCREEN glamour and Hollywood fantasies apart, what was Beethoven's
love life really like? Messy is the short answer. Complex and
paradoxical, a bit like the old master himself.
Beethoven did not exactly blend inconspicuously into the polite and
aristocratic Viennese society which greeted the young genius when he
moved there at the age of 22. A bit of a roughneck and a bruiser
(literally) he had an ambivalent relationship with his patrons.
He tidied himself up for a while, and obviously courted their favours
and accepted their patronage. But at the same time he flung it back in
their faces. One aristocratic lady begged him on her knees to play for
him. Beethoven dismissed her with contempt.
Women seemed fascinated and repelled by his appearance. One wrote of
him as: ''small and plain-looking, with an ugly, red, pock-marked face;
his hair hung shaggily around his face, he spoke in a strong dialect,
was unmannerly in gesture and demeanour, and very haughty.''
But Beethoven, for all his arrogant and stubborn independence, was
desperate to be married. There were countless women in his life. He fell
repeatedly and violently in love. And usually he fell in love with women
considered to be above his station.
He proposed to many, and was rejected by all. Women tended to flirt or
have a fling with him, then end up marrying someone from their own
society, from the nobility. It's crudely possible he was seen by some of
them as a passing conquest -- a bit of rough trade.
He may also have been a bit of a stud. One of Beethoven's closest
friends, Franz Wegeler, wrote: ''The truth of the matter is that
Beethoven never was out of love, and usually was much affected by the
love he was in at the time. In Vienna, Beethoven always had some love
affair in hand, and on occasion he made conquests which many an Adonis
would have found it difficult, if not impossible, to encompass.''
While aspiring to marry into the upper class (and his failure to marry
depressed him) Beethoven almost certainly also used prostitues. He
referred to them, with perhaps a touch of self-disgust, as ''rotten
fortresses''.
And then of course, there is the great mystery, the letter of 1812 to
the Unsterbliche Geliebte, the Immortal Beloved. ''My angel, my all, my
very self . . . ''
Why 42-year-old Beethoven poured his passion into a letter that
remained unsent, remains -- along with the identity of the beloved --
unknown.
Just about every woman with whom Beethoven was associated has been a
candidate over the centuries, though it is felt strongly now by some
scholars that she was Antonie Brentano, who became dedicatee of the
monumental Diabelli Variations, one of Beethoven's greatest works. The
fact that Antonie was married would account for the anonymity in the
letter. Her unavailability and the impossibility of the relationship
quite clearly tears Beethoven apart.
Interestingly, four years after the letter was written, Fanny
Giannastasia, daughter of a school owner with whom Beethoven had
business, overheard a conversation between the two men and recorded it
in her diary.
Beethoven told her father that he was unhappy in love, and that ''five
years ago he had made the acquaintance of a person, a union with whom he
would have considered the great happiness of his life. It was not to be
thought of, an impossibility, a chimera,'' said the great composer.
''Never the less,'' Fanny records Beethoven as saying, ''it is now as
on the first day.'' Eleven years later he was dead. Antonie, apparently
happily married, outlived him by 42 years.

THE Church of Scotland must gain members from six vital areas of the
population if it is to influence the world of the future, it is stated
in a report to the Kirk's General Assembly, which meets in May.
The board of national mission says these are:
* Children and young people with no church involvement and little
exposure to Christian teaching.
* The ''gender gap''. One and half million men are outwith the church
and an increasing number of women feel alienated.
* ''Left outsiders'', people who assume they are rejected because of
class, lifestyle, or their style of spirituality.
* ''Country casuals'', people who attend services out of tradition
instead of playing an active part and have only a loose nominal
association to the church.
* ''Society shapers'', the thinkers who make public announcements and
decide public policy.
* The ''grey area'', formed by 70% of senior citizens who are now
outside the Church.
The Kirk's membership is now 700,000 compared with 1m in 1971.
The Rev Ian Black, convener of the board, said yesterday the role of
women in the Church of Scotland was developing steadily, but women
members still believed it was too male-dominated.
The board will ask the assembly to approve a strategy for the
re-evangelisation of Scotland. It calls on every presbytery to make a
commitment to mission.
As a long-term aim, four full-time ministries for deaf people in
Scotland are proposed in the report. They could be in Aberdeen,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Ayrshire.

Scotland's world-champion Latin American ballroom dancers show that
they have no mean feet as they tell Mary Brennan of their path to
success
TO be world champions once involves an element of luck as well as
ability. To be world champions twice probably proves it wasn't a fluke!
But 11 times? In succession? Well -- discounting demonic intervention --
this would suggest a very special talent allied to triple-strength
willpower, sauced with passionate obsession.
Frankly, in the case of Donnie Burns and Gaynor Fairweather, I think
we can discount the Faustian contract. I doubt if the Devil could
dictate terms to either of them. And that's partly why they remain
reigning champions across more than a decade, chalking up more titles
than the previous five holders among them.
Underneath the very real charm, humour and courtesy there's an
obdurate streak that refuses to sell anything -- themselves or their art
-- short.
Their art is dance. Latin American ballroom dancing. And if you were
going to sneer, trot out that hackneyed old line about sewing on their
own sequins . . . better forget it. You're showing both your age and
your ignorance. Go instead to The Shed on May 13 (the former Harland and
Wolff building in Govan) during Mayfest and Donnie and Gaynor will
demonstrate just how far they have prised style, and the presentation,
away from the fossil-rhinestones of yesteryear.
Gone are the stiff and shiny costumes that helped create the
credibility problem that still stalks ballroom dancing in this country.
Donnie laughs and shakes his head. ''People wondered why the world
wasn't taking them seriously -- and they're running around like
something from the Planet Zog. I thought 'nah -- this isn't for the
Burns boy'.''
These days there's hardly a sequin in sight. Donnie adds: ''I wear a
combination of street gear and what a flamenco dancer would wear. The
actual dancing itself -- I'd say we've unstarched it. Made it less
formal, but still tried to keep the characterisation, the authentic
roots of each dance. A lot of the original spice had been lost from
these dances, been diluted. We want that authenticity back in there.''
Looking back at the history of it all, he reckons the dance world
didn't do itself, or the Latin dances, too many favours when it
introduced them into formal competition. ''They took street dances,
ethnic street dances, and they gave them a technique which made them
look beautiful -- to the Western eye. And that's entirely different from
what looks beautiful to the Afro-Cuban eye.
''In a way, that's a failure. Because we diluted the guts out of those
dances. To me, the apparent ugliness of the originals is much more
attractive. It's got blood and sweat and energy.
''I mean -- if you took Frank Sinatra or Michael Jackson, put their
voice through some kind of electronic purifier, by the end of it Billy
Jean or My Way would be -- nothing much, nothing special. Bland. You
need some grit, some guts. And I think, sometimes, the people in the
street know that better than we do. Because they're not caught up in the
formula, the official lines.
''The woman who makes milkshakes in McDonald's -- when she hears a
piece of music, Paso Doble say, she has a feeling about what she should
see, about what the dance should do. If that doesn't happen -- because
it's too artificial, too cosmeticised -- then we've failed. Time to pack
up and go home.''
He finishes, and settles back in his armchair. The words ''I rest my
case'' hang unspoken in the air. He talks a good line, does Donnie
Burns. Shrewd observations, serious points, colourful turns of phrase.
He could have been a lawyer . . . indeed, he would have been a lawyer if
he hadn't jumped class and gone dancing.
The problem was -- exams week at Glasgow University clashed with the
Blackpool Dance Festival. The truth was -- he found law unutterably
boring. ''It was a matter of making choices. Well actually, there wasn't
any choice. Law just didn't matter to me. Law was a . . . haemorrhoid.
It had got to go!'' It did and he went, leaving at the end of the second
year.
He recalls his father ''went ballistic. Was Mr Bloody-beside-himself
for two weeks . . .'' Little wonder. Both parents were teachers and --
despite a family tendency towards music and showbiz -- expected Donnie
to set his career sights on something more academic than (as he puts it)
struttin' his stuff.
He makes an entertaining anecdote out of all this. After all, he's now
at the top of the professional ladder, diary crammed with engagements in
Europe, Japan and America -- even, finally, his native Scotland.
But between the droll asides, there emerges a picture of
single-mindedness that came on stream when he was only seven. From that
day on he knew what he was meant to do. He talks seriously about the
roots of Latin dance -- and about the changing face of social dance, the
effects of recession, of television programmes like Come Dancing and
films like Strictly Ballroom on public perceptions of ballroom dancing
-- because he is, 110% serious about his profession. Fulfilling your
destiny is a full-time occupation.
Gaynor slips into the room while Donnie is talking about the paranoid
dedicated practice needed to keep ahead of the game, ahead of yourself.
An average day includes four to six hours' rehearsal, sometimes a
session with a respected teacher like John Delroy.
There's the time spent on choreographing new routines, on devising
costumes and that's before you get to the stage of travelling and
performing. Everthing feeds into dancing. Even Gaynor's recent change of
hairstyle -- she now is very Cyd Charisse with a short black bob --
influences how she moves and what she wears. Hats no longer fit the
equation and there is she thinks, a carefree element that has crept into
the way she dances now.
''You just never switch off, really,'' she says. ''You don't ever
relax, not even when you're supposedly 'relaxing'. I'll go on holiday --
but I'll be thinking 'Next week we're back into it . . .' and I'll watch
what I'm eating and drinking so as to keep the stamina there and
ready.''
Letting off steam, however, is something else again. Donnie freely
admits to indulging in bouts of utter childishness. ''Anything
male-childish. Games. Or driving cars like some suicidal, kamikaze
maniac. And toys. Scalextric, train sets . . . cuddly toys . . . squeaky
toys. It's probably some psychosis!'' Meanwhile Gaynor -- whom he
blithely shops as losing herself in clothes indulgence -- is cheerfully
chipping in ''he throws food too sometimes!''
But like their dance routines, this camraderie is the result of hard
work. ''Life was a sado-masochistic trip for the first two or three
years,'' says Donnie. ''More like the first five or six,'' murmurs
Gaynor.
What kept them together was the sudden success of the partnership.
''We would have extracted organs from each other without anaesthesia if
it hadn't been for that,'' says Donnie dryly.
But winning became a habit, that, like the partnership, has continued
for 17 years. And nowadays they are, in Gaynor's view, a perfect couple.
He calls her 'Tinks' -- ''Tinkie. He says I'm a tink,'' Gaynor tells me.
I don't discover what she calls him.
It all seems light years away from the intense, visceral performances
that have made them dance icons in countries such as Japan where they
appear regularly before crowds of 35,000. It's not unlike the split
personality Donnie identifies when he watches videos of them dancing.
(Needless to say, they both hate doing this and automatically scan for
imperfections no-one else would probably clock.)
''It is strange. I'm a loud type. I'm not quiet, I am loud. And so
people tend to think you're very confident, reasonably arrogant and have
no question marks at all. No doubts. Just blissful ignorance. And it's
not like that.
''There is a kind of terror, or something, beforehand. A bit like a
chocolate fireguard expecting the heat. But I tell you -- when the music
starts, or the spotlight hits, a different persona takes over. There are
videos where -- in Japan, say -- I've leapt into the crowd. I watch
this. C-r-r-inge. I don't recognise myself. I -- me -- this little guy
from Hamilton -- wouldn't do that. And Gaynor's got this look that says
'Donnie'll be back in a minute. Somebody else has taken over the pod'.
''But while it's happening, I really am there. I'm absolutely, mind
and body, in control. I feel master of it, totally at one with it.''
And now, thanks to Mayfest, Glasgow gets a chance to see the veritable
phenomenom that is Donnie Burns and Gaynor Fairweather live. It's an
emotional prospect. They are after all, supreme world champions dancing
under a Scottish flag, and yet they're oftener in Japan, Germany or
America than here.
The show is still in its formative stages -- which means Donnie is
giving nothing away bar the fact that, yes, they are setting a piece to
Carmina Burana and yes, the music will be live. ''It gives it that extra
edge, makes it spontaneous, makes it spark.''

IT is not often I find myself in agreement with the Institute of
Directors but it does seem to be talking sense when it says that a
normal healthy mother does not need 18 weeks' maternity leave. A House
of Commons Select Committee, needless to say composed mostly of men,
proposes to raise the period of maternity leave to this level and
increase the scope of maternity pay.
The IOD says this could damage employment prospects for women by
making it more expensive to employ them. Sadly we already see enough
cases of pregnant women being discriminated against.
It is no longer maternity leave that is required for women who are in
paid employment outside the home, but more affordable and better
childcare. If mothers felt they were leaving their children in caring
and competent hands then many would feel less concerned about taking
time off after the birth of their children.
As is so often the case when it comes to social matters, several of
our European partners provide tangible evidence of what can be achieved
in terms of childcare. In many European countries it is normal for
pre-school children to attend subsidised daycare. In France more than
90% of children from age three to school age have places in publicly
funded childcare services, double the number of places for similar age
UK children.
The Government has finally woken up to the fact that pre-school
education is too important to leave to the vagaries of the market. Not
before time it has acknowledged the benefits of educating very young
children in its plan to give vouchers to parents of young children to
enable them to ''shop around'' for nursery schooling.
If parents are allowed to top up their vouchers with their own money,
this would increase the total amount of money spent on education without
increasing the tax burden for the parents and the childless.
If successful this may be a useful scheme to extend to all levels of
schooling. It could enable financially less-well-off parents to have a
better choice of school in the state and private sector. But more is
needed to be done for mothers with young children.
One possible route to better UK childcare provision could be by
providing tax relief on childcare costs. This could possibly be in the
form of vouchers which parents could use to offset the cost of employing
a childminder or nannie or paying for a private nursery.
Currently a variety of options are employed, depending on the wealth
of the family. Grandparents, childminders, or more expensive au pairs
and nannies and private nurseries are all used to varying degrees. If
some form of help were made available for childcare costs then many more
young mums would be able to afford to take up relatively low-paid jobs
and come off state benefits.
Evidence seems to suggest that it is not just mothers who would
benefit from better childcare provision. Particularly in the case of
highly skilled women, employers would benefit from attracting back
valued and trained employees after they have had children. In addition,
Government expenditure on childcare provision could help the overall
economy.
In many cases motherhood leads to considerable loss of earnings. This
is because many mothers forego several years of paid employment outside
the home, until all their children are at school. This paid employment
gap reduces their earnings power on re-entry to the jobs market.
Research has shown that a typical mum with two children foregoes
lifetime earnings of around #220,000. Women who have children earn
10%-20% less (depending on the number of children) than those who do
not, even after taking into account differences in qualifications and
experience.
Often an argument used against providing tax relief on childcare is
that it discriminates against those mothers who choose to remain at
home. A similar argument could be used for a variety of tax reliefs such
as those for people with mortgages or personal equity plans (PEPs).
Besides, this misses the point. The purpose of tax relief would be to
enable mothers to exercise the choice of whether or not to work outside
the home.
Even without tax relief, a majority of mums are now in full-time or
part-time work outside the home. The steady growth in the participation
of women in the labour force over recent years has been largely fuelled
by the increasing return to work of mothers.
Between 1984 and 1994, the economic activity rate for mothers
increased from 55% to 64%, accounting for much of the increase from 66%
to 71% for all working-age women.
Data from the Labour Force Survey shows that the greatest increase in
labour market participation since 1984 has been among women with
children aged under five, up from 37% in spring 1984 to 52% in winter
1993/94. However, within the figures a much smaller proportion, about
one quarter, of lone mothers with small children are working.
Women with higher levels of qualification are more likely to be
economically active than those with lower qualifications or none. For
example, for those with children aged up to four years, economic
activity rates ranged from 75% for those with higher qualifications down
to 30% for those with no qualifications. Often the latter group has no
choice but to stay at home; the lack of affordable childcare makes it
impossible for many of these mothers to take a job.
Advertising agencies have long realised the collective power that mums
wield in the market-place. Politicians have recently begun to address
this important constituency with offers of better nursery education.
However, the issue of state-subsidised childcare continues to remain
untackled.

THE Cornish skipper spoke for all the salt-caked sea dogs: ''It has
gone beyond fishing,'' he said yesterday. ''We are stabbing our friends
in the back.
''They are our kith and kin. I feel closer to Canada 3000 miles away
than I do to people 20 miles across the Channel.''
Mick Mahon, sailing out of Newlyn and campaigning for Britain's
withdrawal from the European Common Fisheries Policy, probably does not
include Quebec separatists in his definition of blood loyalty, not least
since they insist on defining themselves as French.
But his decision to fly the Canadian flag from his boat -- and damn
the eyes of Frogs and Dagoes -- chimes perfectly, if predictably, with
the agenda of Little England's anti-Europeans.
Britain's hardy sons are off to war again.
Ottawa recently signed a free trade agreement with the United States,
designed to counterbalance the European Union (of which we still remain
a member), but that is forgotten.
Canada's actions against Spanish trawlers -- in international waters
-- are legally questionable, to say the least of it, but that is
ignored.
Patriots with hearts of oak have found heads to match.
Britain's fishermen do have a huge problem with the CFP, and it will
grow worse when Spanish boats are allowed into the so-called Irish Box
next year. Canada, equally, has an unimpeachable case when it argues
that the Grand Banks off Newfoundland are all but fished out. Most
people also know that Spain, conspicuously, does not trawl by the rules.
Yet these are international issues, matters (with luck) of rational
diplomacy, not blood. The racist streak in British public life, which
makes a special case of the white, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant and
abominates all others, is rearing its sick head again.
What will the jolly jack tars of the Tory back benches say, I wonder,
when our Australian kith and kin express their undying loyalty to the
old country by declaring their nation a Pacific republic?
It is a rare Scot who has no links with Canada. What of it? You can't
usefully define your relationships with the world according to the
current location of Auntie Aggie.
Besides, before we grow too tearful on behalf of old friends and
family, it is worth bearing in mind how it came about that so many Scots
ended up on the other side of the Atlantic.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the fishing war, this argument has
nothing to do with affection for Canada -- and everything to do with
hatred for Europe.
In that, Conservative opinion, as expressed in the papers and on the
back benches, is unprincipled and squalid, a calculated attempt to
exploit sentimental public opinion for reasons that have nothing to do
with the dear old Commonwwealth.
These people have other fish to fry.
The Cornish skipper was right. In other words, it has gone beyond
fishing -- a subject for which Tory MPs showed little taste until it
became useful to do so.
Teddy Taylor, master of the good ship Whipless, was prattling in the
Commons yesterday about Canada's loyalty to Britain in times of crisis.
He did not think to raise the matter of loyalty to the European states
with whom we have signed treaties.
That isn't Teddy's game.
How does it come about that we are obliged to choose between Spain and
Canada? Both have arguments on their side; both can lay claim, through
the Commonwealth or the EU, to our support. If Britain has any role to
play it is that of honest broker, and thus far that seems, thankfully,
to be the Government's aim.
But what is this problem with Europe? Clearly, it now has little to do
with economic arrangements, political sovereignty, or international
relationships. It is more visceral than that, an ugly, ignorant sort of
chauvinism.
In many Tory minds, Europe has replaced the USSR as the evil empire,
and you can only wonder about the world inside their heads.
The truth is, that by promising to veto EU sanctions against Canada,
the Government has demonstrated how Europe actually operates -- in sharp
contrast to the tired, deceitful populism of the Europhobes.
Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Holland are likely to side with the UK:
where now is the malign European conspiracy? There are shoals of red
herrings, if not halibut, swimming around.
Many people might agree they feel closer to Canada than to Europe. But
why is it inevitable that affection for one demands distaste for the
other? This Britannia is sinking beneath waves she once ruled.

FROM the post-bag: ''I have been a Conservative all my life but I am
more than disappointed with the performance of the present Government.
It is high time we came out of the EU as we seem to be the losers.
''We should never have abandoned the Commonwealth countries and
Britain will pay the price of her folly in Europe, thanks to Mr Edward
Heath.
''I shall be voting Liberal in future.''
The logic of the ballot box is often difficult to comprehend. I still
recall the lady in Edinburgh South constituency who told me she was
unable to vote for Michael Ancram because ''he is involved in the
Protestant Action movement''. No amount of persuasion, not even the
suggestion that Cardinal Gray might confirm the candidate's religious
status, would alter her view.
Another fellow insisted he was not going to support me as I declined
to come out in favour of ''capital punishment'' in schools.
All the opinion polls would suggest that the good people of Perthshire
are about to vote in large numbers for an SNP candidate who would
abolish the monarchy if she had the chance and who is a mile-and-a-half
to the left of Townee Blur. It is a bit like grouse voting for the
twelfth.
''We are only doing this to shake up the Government,'' they tell you,
''we will probably vote Tory at the General Election.'' Oh, that's all
right then.
I find the present political situation extremely fascinating. Townee
takes the Labour Party ever further right; what's next, belting parents
of truants on television, perhaps, or putting anti-social tenants in the
stocks? The Conservative Party is in turn encouraged to wrap itself in
the Union flag. Demned sure we are not goin' to drop any Customs
barriers and let old Johnny Foreigner through; the rest of Europe can
please itself. It is isolationism writ large . . . dangerous nonsense,
too.
And the good old Liberals, what's happened to them? Not a lot is the
answer.
In fact, young Mr Blur is moving so fast the middle ground is
disappearing like quicksand. Mr Paddy is grand for waving his hands in
the air but no-one is paying the slightest attention to what he is
saying.
Here in Scotland you could walk along a street and ask folk who the
leader of the Libs was in this part of the world and give a prize of a
''Lady Godiva'' to anyone who knew. Indeed I tried it and can tell you
that your money would be safe. Out of 10 people questioned, four said it
was David Steel, one opted for Cyril Smith, and the other five declared
they neither knew nor cared.
This is not great news for Jim Wallace.
We all know Liberals whom we like. Ming Campbell is a good chap for a
lawyer and sports a safe pair of hands. Alan Beith I rather took to on a
recent acquaintance and Russell Johnston was always the kind of chap you
would be happy to have a dram with.
They are much the same at local government level, terribly worthy,
always appearing to be reasonable if a trifle short on the
decision-making process. The rich ones always feel rather guilty about
it.
But what does the party as a whole stand for? Proportional
representation.
Yes, I favour that system myself but you and I know, Paddy, that if he
thinks it will bring him power, Blur will have it in his manifesto
quicker than you can rewrite Clause 4.
Europe. The Liberals are in favour of Britain being in the heart of
the EU and -- despite my correspondent -- always have been.
Yup, but Townee, having been a bit of a sceptic when he was going
through his socialist phase, is now practically bedded down in Brussels.
And old Kinnockio is already in with the bricks. Not much clear yellow
water there, I'm afraid.
Federalism? Mmmmm! The Labour Party's plan for regional assemblies
goes some way down that road even although you only get them if you want
them or if there is party advantage in creating them.
Legalising cannabis. Now this is a very distinctive Liberal policy. I
think we can safely say Mr Blur will not be pinching this one. We might
also assume it will not win too much public support either.
More public spending. Indeed, the Liberals have publicly stated,
unlike the feardies in the people's party, that they will spend more on
education.
Maybe this is the way forward for Mr Ashdown and his little gang. They
could put on the No 11 jersey, move into the vacant left-wing spot,
appeal to those who still believe in nationalisation and comprehensive
education, not to mention the building of council houses.
They could write a new song called The Yellow Flag and, unlike their
socialist counterparts, they might even learn the words. Tony Benn could
join them on a free transfer.
Short of this, as old Crossbencher used to write, what does Paddy see
when he gazes into the mirror of the bedroom of the thatched cottage by
the sea? Somebody who is pretty close to being washed up.
Nice of Keith Geddes, Lothian Regional Council's Labour leader, to
write to us at The Herald. I am still hoping that he, or Townee, or wee
George, could answer the questions I put last week regarding the future
of non-state schools in the capital of Scotland.
Now they are quite straight-forward and I am sure you will manage if
you take them slowly. Will Labour abandon the assisted places scheme and
will they seek to alter the charitable status of such establishments? Do
you want me to get John Humphrys to ask them?

FARMER Humphrey Errington is to restart production of his
controversial Lanark Blue cheese today.
He said yesterday that he had decided to make this year's batch from
unpasteurised ewes' milk despite a legal battle to stop the destruction
of much of last year's cheese.
His firm -- H J Errington, of Ogscastle, Dunsyre, Lanarkshire -- is
appealing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh against an order granted
to Clydesdale District Council to destroy nearly a ton of Lanark Blue.
The council's health officers say it contains unacceptable levels of the
food bug listeria.
The judicial review of the case has only been partly heard and Mr
Errington is awaiting a date for the continued hearing.
Yesterday, Mr Errington said: ''We have not given up the fight to save
last year's batch.
''But I decided to go ahead and make fresh supplies because of public
demand.
''I am taking extra precautions by carrying out additional testing of
the unpasteurised milk that we will be using. That doesn't mean to say
last year's cheese was unsafe -- quite the opposite.''
Mr Errington, 50, said there would be a Government health warning on
new batches stating that the Government's chief medical officer advises
that pregnant women and immuno-incapacitated should not eat ''blue
vein'' cheese.
Mr Errington said he wanted to keep his seven staff working and they
were continuing to make Dunsyre Blue cheese, from cows' milk, which has
been totally unaffected by the listeria controversy.
His firm hopes to make up 30 tons of Lanark Blue during the spring.
Clydesdale director of environmental health, Mr Bob Russell, said
there was no order preventing Mr Errington's firm producing new Lanark
Blue.

JAMES Naughtie, presenter of the Radio 4 Today programme and lad o'
pairts, yesterday chaired the prestigious Britain and the World
conference, sharing the platform with such as John Major and Henry
Kissinger.
Naughtie, renowned for his forgetfulness, turned up without a watch,
something of a problem for a chairperson who has to stick to rigorous
timetable. He managed to borrow a timepiece from a young lady conference
organiser. And thus it was that he led the serious discussion about
Britain's role in the world wearing a Mickey Mouse watch.
Lend me your ears
WHAT is it with those of a Tory persuasion who would be councillors in
Argyll &amp; Bute but are reluctant to stand under the party name. James
McMillan, once an independent but now a fully paid-up member of the
Conservatives, has chosen to run for the new authority as ''The Voice of
Experience Working For You Party''.
Signs of failure
A RUNNER-up in the Livewire competition for young business people in
South-west Scotland was Lara Springgay from near Annan. She works as a
clairvoyant. Now, as well as coping with the disappointment of narrowly
missing the #1500 first prize, she will have to put up with everyone
telling her should have known she wasn't going to win.
Degree of truth
FROM a job application form submitted by a BA (Hons) graduate of a
leading Scottish university to a leading local authority (the names of
which have been deleted to protect the bewildered):
Asked to describe experience gained in present post he replied:
''Employers want robots not people.'' Under experience gained in
previous post we find: ''All bosses are bastards.'' And finally, asked
his experience of unpaid voluntary activities, he replied: ''Never work
for anything but money.''
He didn't get an interview.
Weight of evidence
TWO Diary readers with a forensic bent have separately been examining
the new two-volume Glasgow phone books which BT claimed were necessary
to replace the too bulky single-book predecessor.
Some vital statistics:
* Number of pages in old directory -- 922. Number of pages in new
two-volume directory -- 930, including 16 full-page adverts for BT, and
20 pages of inserts advertising Phone Day.
* Weight of old directory -- 1.25 kilos. Combined weight of new
two-volume directories -- 1.25 kilos.
Warm welcome
BBC Scotland head of television Colin Cameron was at the Oscar
ceremony where the BBC-sponsored Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life
short film won an award. Cameron was in full Highland dress for the
occasion and was approached by an impressed member of the audience with
the words: ''I've been at the Oscars for the past 15 years and this is
the first time I've seen anyone wearing the quilt.''
THE CONVENER'S TALE, CONTINUED
WE come to the penultimate extract of The Convener's Tale. New readers
begin here: Frances Duncan, convener of Tayside region, goes on a trade
mission to the People's Republic of China. On her return she has the
council publish her diaries of the great journey, from telling her
husband Ron to remember to change his socks to what kind of wee biscuits
were laid on in her hotel room in Haikou.
We pick up the story as the convener and fellow delegation members are
treated by the vice-governor of Haikou to an ''evening of relaxation --
just how relaxing I was about to discover'':
We exchanged gifts, laughed a lot. My stories must have translated
well!! During the banquet the governor asked if I was interested in
Chinese medicine. ''As it so happens,'' I replied, ''I've been troubled
with my neck and shoulders for a number of years.''. He said: ''You
arrive ill -- you leave well.''
After the banquet the entertainment begins. One of the hosts requested
that Ken Macdonald and I firmly hold nine chopsticks between our
fingers. The gentleman then takes Bank of Scotland #10 note, gathers an
inner strength, and ''hey presto'' the #10 hits the chopsticks with an
almighty wallop and cuts them in half.
The same gentleman looks at my neck and shoulders. He tells me I have
worked hard over a long period of time and ''dead blood'' has gathered.
He puts me into a slight trance. he then dips his finger in water on the
table and throws it on my neck. I feel a burning sensation. Suddenly
everyone is silent. The laughing and joking stops and blood begins to
appear from six or seven different spots at the back of my neck. He then
burns some paper, puts it in a wine glass and attaches the glass to the
back of my neck. The blood then runs into the glass and he wipes my
neck. The only mark to be seen is the one left by the rim of the glass.
There is a problem as the convener fails to come out of the trance.
One member thought: ''How on earth are we going to explain losing the
convener in a trance when we get to Tayside!!'' I eventually come round
feeling as if the world had been removed from my shoulders. To date I
have not had a single twinge. A miracle.
Then it was on to ''Sanya City, called the Hawaii of China'': We are
given a huge coconut each with the top sliced off and a drinking straw.
The milk is very pleasant to drink and not at all as we know it in this
country. Our host this evening is the Mayor of Sanya City who turns out
to be a poet who has had three books of his poems published. He gifted
me a signed copy of each book. He invited the delegation to join him at
a karaoke in the hotel, where he sang a song as did others. Have no
fear, a number of the delegation kept the side.
Next day saw us visiting a golf course in the making. We took the
opportunity to inform our hosts that Scotland is the home of golf and St
Andrews just a short distance from Tayside.
Tomorrow in the last episode of The Convener's Tale -- fishing for
pearls, eating peanuts with chopsticks, and an encounter with the
garoupa fish. Adapted, entirely without permission, from The Convener's
Trade Mission to China, published by Tayside Regional Council.

I WOULD like to correct the impression given by the report about a new
courthouse for Dumbarton (March 25).
It was the Scottish Courts Administration, not the district council,
which chose a site on Dumbarton Common for the new court. After carrying
out a geotechnical survey of the site, the Courts Administration has now
indicated that it wishes to buy it. It chose not to take up the option
of building alongside the existing court building in Church Street, one
of the 15 options presented to it by the district council.
The final decision on disposal of common land, as you correctly
reported, will be taken by the Court of Session.

HAVING once again come across the mangled wreckage of cars and their
occupants on the ''killer'' road, the A77 (any regular user of the road
will have witnessed similar scenes of carnage), I find myself asking why
the issues surrounding this road seem to have been overtaken by slanging
matches about trees when there are more serious questions about the road
which are not being addressed.
As I understand it, the new motorway will run from the existing M77 at
Haggs Castle to the A77 at Malletsheugh, thus bypassing the slowest part
of the journey from Ayrshire into the centre of Glasgow, ie Newton
Mearns through Thornliebank and Haggs Castle.
There is no doubt that this will be a boon to regular commuters and
should cut their journey time.
However, the horrific fatal accidents occur on the A77 itself, which
is not being upgraded. The effect of this will be simply to increase the
speed and amount of traffic on the A77 itself (the traffic-lights
through Newton Mearns must control the flow of traffic on to the road at
present) and lead to more accidents on the road.
George Foulkes's comments on the most recent accident, that the M77
link will reduce accidents, are misguided. Without the whole road being
upgraded there will be no such effect. It will get worse.
The whole road needs upgraded. I fear that the M77 link road will make
the situation worse and no amount of appeals for more responsible
driving will help.
The Pollok Free State protests are a completely different issue,
concerned with the environmental implications of the new road on the
people of Pollok. Here, too, the real issue seems to be ignored. There
is much more at stake than trees, such as the effects of pollution on an
already deprived area with the concomitant problems of ill-health.

THE latest tragic accident on the A77 invokes anxious calls by MPs and
others for an upgrading of the Malletsheugh link to Fenwick (March 27).
The Scottish Office appears to have tried its best, through double
white lining, a speed limit of 60mph, and other drainage and signposting
measures, to improve the safety record of the A77.
If it has been the case that the accidents originating on the
northbound carriageway, because of driver loss of control, for example,
form the majority of the tragedies, may it not be that the wrong
road-crossfall is, in fact, a needless hazard?
I have felt uncomfortably precarious, especially rounding the wide
bend near Newton Mearns at the Loganswell monument.
Just as a rail track requires crossfall to suit the speed on curves
(superelevation), so, surely, must the road-crossfall properly meet the
70mph A77 speed on its various wide bends.
The road authority may take years yet to acquire funding for the full
upgrading of the A77. Would it not be fairly simple, given an absence of
underground services, to get contracts for lowering the inner edge of
the northbound carriageway to provide the correct crossfall, at the
worst locations?
That, surely, would at least help to contain vehicles within their
side of the wide road, even if, as we all do at some times, their
drivers enter the bends too fast.

Jennifer Cunningham reports on the new name and new role for 'the
cruelty'
FROM now on it's Children 1st. Not before time, that tongue-twisting
and confusing mouthful of initials, the RSSPCC, is to disappear. After
111 years the need to prevent cruelty to children is still with us, but
as a society we have at last realised that knocking on the door and
whisking the children off to a home is not the answer.
It was never more than an emergency stop-gap. When local government
was reorganised last time round in 1975, the regional council social
work departments had statutory responsibility for dealing with children
at risk of abuse and neglect. Yet the public who were concerned about
children would stick to the habit of phoning the cruelty who would then
send its inspectors to investigate.
For some years there was no love lost between certain social work
departments and the society. Its inspectors were good, kindly people,
many of them had years of experience, but they were dogged by an
amateurism due to lack of training and lack of statutory power.
In the meantime, national voluntary organisations such as Barnardos,
the National Children's Home, Childline, and Save the Children, stepped
into the gap to provide specific services for children and families --
often largely funded by central and local government. Another Scottish
charity with its roots in the previous century, Quarriers, was forced by
financial necessity to gauge the wind of change in social policy rather
earlier and adapt itself, providing specialised services for particular
clients -- in its case epileptics and some children requiring new
families.
The RSSPCC undertook a similar process of change more gradually -- and
that was its problem. The work has been moving from investigation to
positive help over the past 20 years, with family resource centres
providing both play sessions for children and the opportunity for
parents to learn parenting skills and to share experiences in parents'
support groups.
Gradually the inspectors were replaced by qualified social workers
more interested in project work to prevent the sort of violent crises
which result in children being taken into care.
Mainly because the social work department was so small, Orkney was the
last place where society inspectors investigated allegations of abuse.
Criticism of their role was the epilogue to the society's original task.
Since then annual income has been falling and is now less than #2m. In
1993 income was #1,988,000; expenditure #1,976,000, giving a minimal
surplus of #12,000. So far 1994 figures are not available, but they
spent more.
Still, though, as many as one in eight children in Scotland suffer
some form of cruelty: neglect, emotional, physical or sexual abuse,
according to Children 1st.
Catherine Dewar, the new director of children and family services,
says the service will now be very specifically-targeted towards children
and families with particular problems. There are now five family
resource centres scattered throughout the country, in Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Dundee, Selkirk, and Killen near Inverness. They offer
counselling -- for children and adults -- who have suffered abuse,
support groups for abuse survivors, and group work for families with
problems.
The boundaries have been established, Children 1st will receive
referrals from social work departments for specific work. Cathy Dewar
would also like to establish a financial as well as professional
partnership for more of their projects. Currently local and central
government funding combined amounts to only 7% and the society has
preferred to keep it low to guard its independence.   At last the wheel
has turned full circle and keeping families together rather than
splitting them up is the aim. Children 1st is strapped for cash, but
when it launches its new fund-raising campaign in September it will be
to help parents look after their kids, not to charge in and snatch them
away.

THERE was uproar in court yesterday as a verdict of not proven was
returned on a man accused of the brutal murder of a drugs counsellor.
Supporters of the 27-year-old accused, Mr Henry Graham, erupted in
approval at the jury's majority verdict.
Mrs Jean Horne, the sister of the dead man, Mr Donaldson Imrie, broke
down in tears and cried out: ''Who killed my brother then?''
Earlier in the five-day trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, Mr
Graham's co-accused, Mr Colin Young, 31, was cleared of murder when Lord
Abernethy ruled that there was not enough evidence against him to allow
the case to go to the jury.
Mr Imrie, 37, was found unconscious with a fractured skull in the
early hours of November 25 last year after an anonymous phone call to
the ambulance service that ''there is a man dying in the park''.
Ambulancemen found Mr Imrie lying face down in a car park at Kingsinch
School, Inch Park, Edinburgh, with his bloodstained sweatshirt wrapped
round his head.
He had suffered a total of 41 separate injuries including 27 to his
head and neck after being kicked, stamped on and battered by a hammer.
He died three days later in Edinburgh's Western General Hospital.
Mr Young, of Ravenswood Avenue, and Mr Graham, a painter and
decorator, of Walter Scott Avenue, both Edinburgh, denied murdering Mr
Imrie, a drugs and alcohol counsellor of Madeira Street, Leith, and
robbing him of a wallet.
The jury heard that the three men had been seen leaving the Royal Oak
public house in Infirmary Street, Edinburgh, after midnight.
Mr Graham told the court that he had been drinking and smoking
cannabis and could not remember meeting Mr Imrie in the pub. He said
that later he had realised that Mr Imrie had been in the back of Mr
Young's car.
He claimed that they had driven into Inch Park where a row broke out
after they had been drinking. He alleged that Mr Young pulled Mr Imrie
out of the car and started punching and kicking him.
Mr Graham said he had managed to pull Mr Young away and he calmed down
before all three got back into the car to continue drinking.
According to Mr Graham, he then fell asleep and awoke to find Mr Young
standing at the back of the car with a hammer in his hand. Mr Imrie was
lying on the ground with his head covered in blood.
After the not proven verdict, Mrs Horne, of Fodbank View, Dunfermline
said: ''Justice is not for us. My brother was so nice. It is sad, really
sad.''

THE authorised work on the M77 through Pollok Park to Newton Mearns
can only make the fatality rate greater on the four-lane section from
Newton Mearns to Fenwick where the collision happened because it will
feed faster traffic into the section with no central reservation.
That four-lane section has been considered as dangerous for over 40
years because of low driving standards and the lack of protection
against driver stupidity.
Double white lines seem to mean as little as 60mph speed limits and
braking distances to a significant number of drivers.
Similar roads in England were rebuilt as double carriageway 30 years
ago and more. The prime example -- Liverpool to Manchester -- was
superseded shortly afterwards by a motorway. As usual, the Scottish
Office does not appear to be interested.
The public needs positive safety measures on the A77 between Newton
Mearns and Fenwick now. Pollok Park to Newton Mearns can wait!

MR George Foulkes and Mr Brian Donohue have chosen to exploit the
tragedy of four deaths on the A77 for their own cynical reasons (March
27). They distort the aims of those protesting at the M77 being
bulldozed through Glasgow's southern housing schemes and parklands.
No-one is campaigning against the upgrading of that particular section
of the A77. No-one is more conscious of the connections between traffic
management and death. In fact a seven-mile stretch of motorway through
Glasgow will pour even more vehicles on to the killer A77, increasing
the likelihood of accidents. The M77 will not only not help the cause
the MPs purport to advance, but will only make it worse.
Perhaps Mr Foulkes and Mr Donohue should explain the facts to their
constituents rather than trying to stir up hatred against those trying
to save their communities and children from traffic pollution.

IF YOU suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, then eating a diet rich in
fish and some plant oil may help. After all, it's a well-known fact that
the Greenland Eskimos rarely suffer from arthritis or heart disease and
they have a diet high in fatty fish such as mackerel. Now the benefits
are confirmed by research by Dr Christine Maple at Ninewells Hospital,
Dundee. She found that a number of rheumatoid arthritis sufferers have
been able to reduce their intake of anti-inflammatory drugs on taking
fish oil supplements.

Squash this
* CHILDREN who drink too much squash and fruit juice, getting their
energy from them rather than from milk, develop the ''squash drinking
syndrome'', leading to poor appetite, irritability, diarrhoea, and
inadequate weight gain, doctors at Southampton University have found.
They say that consumption of soft drinks has gone up between three and
five times in 15 years, with children the main target in marketing.
Baccy wacky

SOME 40 years ago I was working as a fur trader with the Hudson's Bay
Company in the very isolated Indian village of Fond du Lac on Lake
Athabasca.
One evening in January, when it was indeed ''forty below'', a stranger
came ''out of the night'', as Robert Service might have said (Alan
Bold's review, March 25). This was Chic Terry, a Texan, who was the
Saskatchewan Government's fur-trapping inspector, on the trail round the
villages with his dogs and sledge. He lodged with us at the post and
during a very welcome evening of ''the crack'' he produced a well-worn
copy of Service's poems.
Many regard the poetry of Service as doggerel but for Terry and the
people who live in northern Canada and the Yukon not only were his
physical descriptions of the North magnificient but he also had a feel
for the soul of the North.
In passing, I recommend to anyone who has not read it yet ''The
Cremation of Sam McGee'', for a lovely bit of almost Scots drollery.
Coincidentally, just as Service spent some of his early days in a bank
so did his contemporary and, in prose, his parallel, William Sydney
Porter (O Henry) although Porter's departure for far-distant lands was
somewhat more precipitate as his bank accountancy was called into
question.

EUROPEAN Union diplomats meet today to consider launching trade
sanctions against Canada in retaliation for its role in the North
Atlantic halibut war.
They will gather in Brussels against a background of rising tension
inside the Community, which has been split by Britain's pledge to defend
its Commonwealth partner by slapping a veto on Spanish-inspired moves to
punish the Canadians.
Spain warned yesterday there would be a ''crisis'' in the EU if the
British broke ranks.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called for peace talks. Other states,
including Germany and Ireland, are reported to be close to the British
position.
A European Commission spokesman said: ''The Canadians have shown an
improvement in their attitude. The situation is better because of this
new spirit. Progress has been made.''
However, as low-level talks continued yesterday, the EU fisheries
commissioner, Mrs Emma Bonino, launched a fierce attack on the Canadians
whom she has already denounced as pirates.
''It is time to stop the war of words,'' she said, apparently
unabashed at simultaneously issuing a nine-page statement attacking the
Canadians for their ''aggressive attitude'' and challenging their
version of events which led to the halibut war.
''We will only find a long-term solution to the Greenland halibut
conflict by respecting international rules and through negotiation,''
Mrs Bonino said.
Her dossier was produced for reporters just before the Canadians
issued their own six-page statement taking point-by-point issue with the
remarks made at the UN in New York earlier this week by Mrs Bonino
during a rumbustious news conference.
As the talks continued with no sign of more senior figures from either
side joining in, the European Commission continued to give strong
backing to Spanish claims that its fleet had done nothing wrong in
trawling the Grand Banks more than 200 miles off the coast of
Newfoundland.
The commission insisted that EU inspectors had found no double hold
for hiding fish in the freezer ship Estai which was seized at gunpoint
by the Canadians in international waters earlier this month. Officials
said they believed the Canadians could have genuinely mistaken storage
methods for an attempt to deceive inspectors.
The commission also challenged Canadian claims about the number of
undersized fish found on the Estai. Almost half the boat's catch was
shown to the world's press when it landed at St John's where EU
inspectors refused to join in an investigation because, the commission
reasoned, they would have been effectively endorsing an illegal act of
seizure.
When the boat reached Spain, EU inspectors (one of them British)
boarded it and reported finding nothing wrong with the catch, suggesting
that the nets the boat had been using were legal.
Throughout yesterday, the Canadians continued to insist that the net
recovered from the seabed, at a point where the Estai's skipper cut his
net as he was being arrested, was indeed from the Estai and had a mesh
which was too small under the rules of the North Atlantic Fisheries
Organisation.
In Brussels, the Canadian ambassador to the EU, Mr Jacques Roy, said:
''I know one thing. That is that our inspectors found the hold.'' When
the Estai was taken to St John's its catch of undersized fish 'was there
for the cameras of the world to see,'' he said.
Canadian fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said the Spanish fishing fleet
was continuing to fish out of control and threatening to destroy what
little remained of stocks off Canada's east coast.
* In the Commons, Mr Hurd said that British-Canadian relations were
''excellent'' despite the fishing dispute. He said Canada House had
contacted him twice in recent days ''to thank us for the stand we are
taking
Tory Euro-sceptic Teresa Gorman (Billericay) said there was ''a deep
sense of loyalty'' felt by the British people towards the Canadians
''who have never failed to come to our rescue when this country has been
threatened by rigours''.
She said: ''The British people are dismayed that we are not taking a
firmer line in supporting Canada now they are being threatened
themselves by the Spanish fishing fleet.''
She urged Mr Hurd to make it clear that the Government would have
nothing to do with sanctions against Canada.
Mr Hurd said: 'We believe that a high degree of enforcement is
necessary.
''While that is being discussed and we hope agreed, it is essential in
our British view that there should be restraint by the Spaniards in not
fishing the areas that are particularly sensitive and by the Canadians
in not taking the law into their own hands, for example cutting nets,
which as we know from our own experience from the Spaniards, is a very
dangerous thing to do.''

WHY do you wish to repeat the myth that the new system of local
government ''will mean that every elector can demand answers about the
full range of services from a single councillor'' (March 27)?
It will mean nothing of the kind. At present police, fire, passenger
transport, valuation, strategic planning, water, sewerage, and the
Children's Panel are all regional council departments, responsible to
regional councils. After April, 1996, they will all be run by joint
boards or be removed from local government altogether.
As I knock on the doors during the election campaign I find the great
majority of people are angry that public accountability will be
diminished by this unwanted reorganisation. It is a pity that you are
less aware than the general public about the Government's real intntion
in imposing this change.

WITH reference to the Bill for disabled people being discussed at
present by the Government, I was dismayed to hear Mr William Hague, MP,
claiming, when arguing the case for all transport to be
wheelchair-accessible, that a lot of bus operators would simply remove
their service if forced to put brand-new buses on the road.
He went on to say the sensible way to do this would be to require bus
operators when renewing vehicles to make sure the new vehicles are
wheelchair-accessible. I wonder, then, if Mr Hague is familiar with the
buses which scour the streets of Glasgow.
If this does in fact become law, then I would urge any disabled people
resident in Glasgow not to hold their breath. It is not unusual to see
buses in Glasgow sporting an A registration. They were put into service
in 1963! Further calculations show that the latest batch of new buses,
few though they seem to be, will still be on the streets of Glasgow in
the year 2027! It quite simply isn't good enough.
If you look at the number of wheelchair-accessible taxis operating in
Glasgow and couple this with the fact that there is a five-year age
restriction on these vehicles, it never ceases to amaze me as to why it
is that both businesses transport the public by road, yet one set of
operators seem to be conducting their day-to-day work with, shall we
say, one wheel tied behind their back!
Why is it OK for Glaswegians to scramble aboard buses which in the
main can only be described as relics, yet taxi operators are expected to
update their vehicles? At least 60% of taxis are already
wheelchair-accessible. All purpose-built taxis being manufactured are
coming off the assembly lines as such.
It is time for Strathclyde Regional Council to push some subsidies in
the taxi trade's direction. It is providing a far superior service to
the public.

THE threat hanging over Scottish Nuclear is a threat to Scotland. Alf
Young's articles need to be taken seriously by our political, civic, and
business leaders. Scotland can be proud of its nuclear electricity
industry, on both the electricity supply and the plant manufacturing
side. We must strongly resist any further loss of these advanced
engineering resources.
If the costs of the existing nuclear stations can be brought down as
planned they will be competitive without any subsidy. Competitive, not
privatisable, for the risks will seem so much greater to the potential
investors than to the industry's professionals.
Hence nuclear energy is privatisable only on terms that would leave a
lot of past commitments and risks, real or imagined, for the public to
carry.
The fate of Scottish Nuclear after the Government's nuclear review
will not therefore depend on private-sector market forces but neither
need it be one of the rival schemes being fought over in Whitehall.
Fortunately, those are not the only possibilities.
The rational home for Scottish nuclear capacity is within the
electricity supply industry of Scotland. The problems with this solution
are no greater than with any other. The integrated planning and
operation worked well in the past. It would provide a mechanism for
sensible use of all this country's fossil and non-fossil energy sources.
Without an integrated structure, the nuclear industry will gradually
wither as the existing stations reach the end of their lives. Scotland
will be still more impoverished.
There will be no long-term alternative when gas prices begin to rise
as they must, no means of meeting our obligation to stop polluting the
atmosphere. Concerted pressure around such a plan could be organised.

THE National Lottery got off to an excellent start and is performing
far better than its sponsors anticipated (hence all the claims that
Camelot, the promoting company, has found a new licence to print money).
The sums involved are staggering, with more than half the population
punting and winners attracting enormous attention because the cash
involved is equally huge. So far, too, it seems as if the competition to
football pools has been contained, though they have lost over a tenth of
their business, but one charitable producer of scratch-card raffles has
been hit badly enough to end its operations abruptly. Charities more
generally seem also to have been badly hit. Charitable giving was kept
high during the late 1980s: in spite of the claims that these years were
a time of selfishness and greed it seems that 80% of the population
contributed something to UK-registered charities in 1987 and '88. That
figure fell to below 75% in 1989 as the recession bit, but gradually
recovered to its previous level in 1993 and most of last year. Since
then, however, there has been a marked falling off in public donation,
with the UK average coming down to 67% of the population. The one
exception to that trend is street collections in Scotland which have
risen modestly (though they too have fallen in England) as smaller
charities revive this direct approach; on the other hand the numbers of
Scots giving directly have slumped by 16%.
The figures were collected by NOP, a major British organisation which
monitors and measures public opinion and enjoys a good reputation for
accuracy, within the limits of error common to all such statistical
surveys, which are not likely to be significant in this case. They are
bound to be disturbing since they confirm many of the fears expressed by
charities about how the lottery would actually affect them, as many
people would imagine that it could meet much if not all of their funding
requirements. The NOP sample found that two-thirds of respondents in
Scotland (and somewhat more in the UK as a whole) thought that the
lottery was a good way of giving to charity, but they tended to
overestimate considerably the amount of each lottery pound which is
actually allocated. The eventual charitable gain from the lottery is not
yet known, and the aggregate sums involved could turn out to be very
high, but the immediate impact has been both negative and severe, though
some bodies, the Scottish cancer charities,for example, have fought off
the challenge.
The survey predicts that even if the Lottery Charities Board is able
to allocate #155m to charities, a continuance of the present trend would
leave them effectively #75m worse off; and the fact is that although not
every charitable activity or institution benefits from the lottery money
(there are rules which exclude some well-known names) all seem likely to
suffer from the way the lottery is affecting popular perceptions of the
need to go on giving. Charities may be panicking too soon: most buyers
of lottery tickets are gambling rather than giving. Rather than wait and
see, the charities can ask for their share of the lottery cake to be
increased (unlikely because of the claims of the other beneficiaries)
but they can also hone their public appeal and let potential donors know
that lottery money is a welcome addition to their income but far from
enough.

KENNETH Barclay's comments on the rating of empty property (Soapbox,
March 22) are a timely reminder that this iniquitous piece of
legislation comes into effect in April 1.
It may be that most of Mr Barclay's clients are companies and the
payment of rates on empty properties will reduce their profits but will
probably not prove financially fatal in many instances.
However, contrast this with a shopkeeper whose business has failed.
Prior to April 1 the shop could be closed and outgoings until it was
disposed of might not be too great. After April 1, when the property has
been empty for three months, then rates will be payable at half the
normal level.
We are still in a property recession and, despite every effort, it is
still possible for properties to be empty for many months. For some
people this additional burden could result in bankruptcy.

TRANSPORT in Scotland is a sclerotic affair but it need not be so. At
the moment the transport infrastructure under which we labour suffers
badly from age and lack of flexibility. As trading patterns and the
needs of the motorist change, as they are bound to do over time, the
suitability of some of the roads, bridges, and other areas of
infrastructure lessens. There are good aspects, but they need to be
improved, and any improvement made must be maintained if its
effectiveness is to remain. Specific examples are easy to find. If you
happen to be a manufacturer in the west central belt of Scotland,
practically every time you send a load by road it must pass across the
centre of Glasgow. To be accurate, it travels along that clogged artery
known otherwise as the M8 link. As the level of traffic increases this
solution becomes less and less tenable. One way to improve matters is
the proposed extension to the M74 which would at least have the benefit
of bringing a second motorway route across the Clyde. Environmental
assessments of this proposed solution have still to be examined in
detail, and if found to be detrimental to the proposals they should not
simply be brushed aside. Everything, including environmental damage, has
a cost, but an M74 extension would undoubtedly make sense as an element
of prospective economic growth.
Other oddities in the way we move our goods and our people around
Scotland are not hard to find. The fact that the main route between
Edinburgh and Glasgow is not even a complete motorway is hard to accept.
There are few nations which would allow a link between their main cities
to exist at such a low standard. Similarly, the A9 northwards, though a
vast improvement on its tortuous predecessor, really should have been
designed initially as a full dual carriageway at least as far as
Inverness. The route to England, which is travelled by such a large
proportion of Scottish goods, is another problem. Manufacturing
industry, as it sends goods and material both ways across the Border,
would benefit greatly from another route of full dual-carriageway
standard; safety, on a road which can be frighteningly busy, would also
be improved. On the problems of rail transport under the fragmenting
effect of progress towards privatisation, it is best not to dwell, save
to say that if Transrail fails to grasp the opportunity of returning
freight lines to Thurso, thus supporting the growing port of Scrabster,
it will carry the blame for a very long time.
All of the problems which we have identified are insignificant when
compared with the key failure of transport in Scotland. That is the
failure to provide an integrated system which is worthy of the name and
which is necessary if Scottish industry, indeed the Scottish economy as
a whole, is to move forward. This problem is addressed today at a
conference on transport infrastructure initiated by the Scottish
Chambers of Commerce. The chambers are anxious to add their separate and
collective voices to the calls for integration of our transport system
and they are to be congratulated on moving the debate forwards with such
determination. They complain, rightly, that there is no coherent
transport infrastructure in place in Scotland and they identify the
cause as a lack of political will to create one. We have called
repeatedly for the formulation of an integrated transport policy. The
arguments, and the weight of opinion behind them, are now undeniable; it
is time for the politicians of all parties to respond.

CLARE Henry argues that gallery-goers deserve to be better informed to
aid their perusal of contemporary art (March 24). Well, in that case,
don't readers of The Herald also deserve to be better informed by its
critics?
In the article she tells us that the exhibition at Tramway is entitled
Young at Heart. Evidently warming to this theme, she asks: ''Are the
artists dead, old or, as the title wrongly implies, very young?''
I wasn't aware that the phrase, ''young at heart'' implies a person to
be very young. If anything, it suggests the opposite: that an old person
has a youthful outlook.
Your critic also says that the audience requires bare facts first,
analysis later, with a useful photograph of each artist to place him
age-wise. Next time there is a Matisse exhibition I shall demand to see
his photograph, and a 2000-word biographical essay, before I deign to
look at his work.
While I concur that there is a case for documentation with more
difficult contemporary work, it has been argued before. I believe
research was carried out which estimated the average attention span of a
gallery visitor at something less than 30 seconds per artwork. So, if
they do ''walk round and out'', they are only conforming to the status
quo.
Your readers are not perhaps aware that the title of the exhibition
is, in fact, Wild at Heart, an error so fundamental that it entirely
negates Clare Henry's primary argument.

Under attack from Canada and Britain, Spanish fishermen claim they are
international scapegoats, reports Alf Hartgen.
GALICIAN fisherman Jose Villaverde studies the dark grey clouds
hovering over his home town of La Coruna, one of Spain's largest fishing
ports. ''We have been chucked out of all the waters in the world,'' he
says, pointing towards the Atlantic Ocean stretching out on the other
side of the town, which is at the tip of a peninsula in north-western
Spain. ''Every morning, you see unemployed fishermen queueing up in
front of the warehouses hoping to get a day's work -- any work that
might be available. It was never like that before.''
The region of Galicia is the cornerstone of the Spanish fishing
industry. With almost half the Spanish fishing fleet, it is bearing the
brunt of current reductions in the number of boats -- the result of
reduced quotas negotiated internationally. But if Spanish fishermen
thought the recent squabble with Britain over the Irish Box was tough,
it now looks like a picnic compared with the row with Canada over
fishing in the north-west Atlantic.
EU quotas in these waters, governed by the North Atlantic Fishing
Organisation (NAFO), will this year be reduced by 90%. As an EU member,
Spain has to let Brussels negotiate with NAFO, not a situation they are
happy with. They have strongly criticised EU negotiators for not taking
a tougher line. As a direct result, say Spanish officials, an estimated
7000 jobs will go, most of them in Galicia.
The Canadian government won't be shedding any tears. It has regularly
condemned Spanish boats for breach of fishing regulations in the
north-west Atlantic. Spain, for its part, refuses to recognise Canadian
authority outside the 200-mile zone, and things came to a head earlier
this month with the seizure of the Spanish trawler Estai.
For Samuel Juarez, Galicia's regional director of fisheries, the
Canadian attacks are part of a scheme to force Spanish boats out of the
area. ''NAFO is not an organisation concerned with conservation of
resources, but serves only Canadian interests. We don't understand why
the Spanish fleet is always the target of this criticism when we see
Korean and Japanese boats fishing in the same areas.''
One reason, say critics, is the Spanish fleet's notorious reputation
for violating regulations. Small wonder, maintains Rafael Conde,
director general in the Ministry of Fisheries in Madrid. Spanish boats
are hampered by a long list of rules applying only to them, he says. He
ticks them off on his fingers; hailing systems, catch reports, limits on
how many boats can fish an area at the same time.
''If you are a driver, and a police car follows you alone, and you can
only do a hundred when all the others are doing a hundred and fifty, and
you have to tell the police two months in advance where you are going --
and no-one else does, it is pretty evident that he will get you more
easily than anybody else.''
But the Spanish fleet does have an image problem, he admits. ''There
is a tendency to find scapegoats. It would be lovely to look at it on a
comparative basis, counting the same type of regulations and
infractions.''
Canadian complaints that Spanish boats breach regulations echo British
criticism. Save Britain's Fish is trying to push the Government to
withdraw from the Common Fisheries Policy, and MPs have evoked images of
the Spanish Armada attacking the empire. Just as controversial has been
the fact that many of the boats fishing in EU waters out of Galicia are
flying the Union Jack rather than the Spanish flag. As UK-registered
vessels with Spanish owners and crews and British captains, they have
rights to a British Government compensation scheme, as well as British
quotas.
But just as Spain attacks the EU for not being tough enough, so Juarez
criticises Madrid for being too lenient on quota negotiations. ''Spanish
fishermen do not get their historical rights. They discovered many
fisheries in the world, and now Spanish boats have been forced out.''
The Galician regional government in turn is taking some flak from
local boat owners. ''It has come to a point where the cutbacks in the
fleet have to stop,'' says Jose Fuertes Gamundi, head of the
co-operative of boat owners in Vigo. ''If not, Spain will be wiped out
as a fishing nation. A lot of countries would like to see that happen.''

hair but I'm not a hippy. I'm a professor of architecture and art.''
Mr Maruma is speaking from his Maruma Centre in Stuttgart, one of
three artistic centres he has set up over the past 15 years since
developing his own concept of art: ''I paint with fire. My architecture
is based on a new concept; it is based on nature, using the influences
of nature in architecture.''
His other centres are in Cologne and New York but he has, he says,
lived in different places throughout the world and absorbed many
influences.
He can understand the dismay of the islanders at the picture that has
been painted of their new owner. And he wants to reassure them that he
has an affinity with the island people and with its landscape. The first
topic for discussion will be the needs of the islanders and the island.
''The first step is to see what are the needs, and then to create
together a new concept for the island. We see what we have to do and we
do it together.''
As soon as he set foot on the island, last August, he knew it was the
island he had been looking for. ''You don't have to ask me why I bought
Eigg. You only have to look at it. It is beautiful.''
He could see the neglect: ''What is needed is to bring up the standard
of the people there, not to destroy anything.
''All these things that have been written about me will have made
people afraid. It's totally wrong. As the islanders get to know me over
the next months and years, they will come to understand that I am a
friend to them, not some eccentric laird or whatever.''
Mr Maruma, aged 41, says he feels an affinity with the Scottish
people. ''I like the Scots. I like their mentality. I like the way they
are fighting against injustices. They have to fight economically against
the English. Whatever they do, the English are taking it away.
''They want more control over their lives. There is no discussion
about this. On this point, we have a common cause.''
The irony of islanders having no control over their own destiny seems
to escape him. But he is keen to emphasise that whatever happens on the
island it will be by mutual agreement.
Once he has established the needs of the island he will begin to build
a financial base on which to realise his ''concept'' for it. ''The first
step would be to begin talking to the islanders. In the first stage, we
can help make the crofts more effective. Making cheese, producing eggs
and wool perhaps.
''The second phase is to create soft tourism, to open up possibilities
for visitors, like a restaurant, more places to sleep or whatever.''
The third step will be to plant more trees and improve forestry on the
island.
The fourth strand of his concept might raise a few eyebrows. It is the
creation of ''ranches''. ''Yes, I know these are more American but it
could be possible to use the concept.''
So how would he describe himself to counter the image of the artistic
weirdo? ''I am a human being, very natural but with a lot of power that
comes from inside. My influences are very wide. I have travelled and
lived all over the world. If you are open you can learn a lot.''
Not, though, so open as to say where the wealth that enabled him to
buy the island was created. He counters by asking where I get my money.
But then I am not buying an island and the community that depends on it.
''Ah yes, but it is not a big deal. It is not a fortune I have paid. If
you buy a house in Stuttgart, you would pay the same price.''
What will cost a lot of money, he concedes, will be to build up the
infrastructure.
The problem he has identified in the Hebrides is, he says, the forces
that cause young people to move away. ''All the young people are leaving
the islands because they have no possibilities. I think this is very
sad. It could be changed. You could establish basic things so that the
young may still live and work on the islands. To open up the
possibilities for them.
''I think if we can realise this what we are talking about will be
something like a pilot project for this area.''
Mr Maruma is clearly flummoxed by the bad press he believes he has
received. He sheafs through 10 cuttings clipped from Scottish papers and
he sighs: ''But I suppose what is needed is more than good words. How is
it you say it? Yes, actions speak louder than words, and that is what I
intend to show.''
He hopes his visit this weekend will allay the fears of islanders and
dispel the mystic myth. ''I think what should be made clear is that I do
not think it is possible to own a place like Eigg. If you get such a
gift, it is only to take care of, to look after. If you look after the
island, you also have to look after the islanders. That is what I want
to clear up.
''In years to come, people will see that I intend to realise the words
I have spoken.''
Mr Maruma speaks with genuine, if injured, conviction. The islanders
for their part wait to be convinced.

GANGSTER Ronnie Kray was yesterday laid to rest amidst all the pomp
and ceremony that the East End of London could muster.
Old enemies acted as pall bearers, heavies in sunglasses kept the
crowds at bay, and there were flowers from criminals throughout the
world, including the New York mafia.
Freed from prison for the day, Ronnie's twin brother Reggie was
treated like a hero by the crowds who lined the streets.
Many of them joined in chants demanding Reggie's freedom after serving
26 years in prison.
Admission to the funeral service was by invitation only.
Six horses with black plumes and dressed in purple and black blankets
pulled the glass-sided hearse through the streets of Bethnal Green, the
manor Ronnie Kray and and his family had ruthlessly dominated in the 50s
and 60s.
A purple floral arrangement spelt ''Ron'' on the side of the hearse.
Another display on the top depicted a boxing-ring -- a reminder of
Ronnie Kray's introduction into fighting and hence the underworld.
More than 40 limousines followed behind.
Crowds of youths ran alongside Reggie's Daimler chanting out his name.
The car followed the lead vehicle decked with floral tributes from the
chief mourner -- reading ''To the other half of me'' and ''The Kray
Twins''.
Minders surrounded his vehicle, not because they feared an attack,
just to put on a show and to keep over-enthusiastic supporters at a
distance.
People who had not been born when the Krays ran their evil empire were
out in force singing their praises.
''It was safe to walk the streets in these days,'' they declared in
front of the world's television cameras. ''Nowadays children are
murdered and old woman raped. The Krays would never have tolerated
that.''
It was Ronnie's funeral. But the star of the day was twin brother
Reggie, let out of prison to attend. He is due to apply for parole in
May. When convicted of the murder of Jack ''The Hat'' McVitie in 1969,
the judge recommended he serve a minimum of 30 years.
They kissed Reggie if they got close enough, they cheered him, and
they chanted ''Free Reggie Now!''
Only the East End of London would have dared put on a show like this.
On the way to St Matthew's Church, Bethnal Green, the cortege halted
outside a block of flats in Vallance Road. The Kray's had been brought
up in this street in a house long since demolished, but the procession
stopped at its site.
The choice of pall bearers from the north, south, west and east of
London was said to be a symbolic gesture of peace. Elder brother
Charlie, represented the Kray family.
It did not come as too much of a surprise that the service began with
Frank Sinatra's hit record: ''I Did It My Way.''
''My brother Ron is now free and at peace,'' twin Reggie said through
family friend Sue McGibbon.
''Ron had a great humour, a vicious temper, was kind and generous. He
did it all his way.
''That's how I'll always remember my twin brother Ron.''
Inside church, Reggie was released from his handcuffs. He sat in the
front pew next to the coffin of his twin.
During the service he rose to join hands with his elder brother
Charlie and three friends encircling the coffin in a minute's silence.
Kray defiance followed in a second message read to the congregation by
Mrs McGibbon.
''I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul,'' she
quoted from William Ernest Henley's poem Invictus.
The officiating priest, Father Christopher Bedford, said he did not
know the state of Ronnie's soul, but God's judgments were true and just.
The church service ended with Whitney Houston's recording of: ''I will
always love you.''
The priest afterwards led the procession through the streets of
London's East End to Chingford Mount cemetery.
* Home Secretary Michael Howard hinted yesterday, in evidence to the
Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, that Reggie Kray may have to
serve all of his 30-year sentence.
When asked by committee chairman Sir Ivan Lawrence, QC, whether the
judge's recommendation would hold, considering a campaign to parole
Kray, Mr Howard said the campaign: ''hasn't as yet succeeded.''

Britain's place in the great scheme of things is up for debate:
William Russell tackles the delicate question of an identity crisis.
IT WAS intended to be a day for asking awkward questions, and that is
what it proved to be. There was one crucial one facing the Britain in
the World conference yesterday in London.
And it was: ''Does a medium-size country of 55 million people which,
for the past half-century, has been punching above its weight in the
world, really need a global foreign policy? A country which, if the
Prince of Wales is to be believed, is suffering an identity crisis which
has turned into a loss of morale and, increasingly, self-confidence?''
It was the answer to that question -- what should Britain's role in
the world be? -- which the great and the good, including, as well as
Prince Charles, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, America's Dr
Henry Kissinger and pretty well anybody who is anybody in Britain today,
sought to find.
Prince Charles might have doubts, as did some of the participants,
about the nation's mental state, but the Prime Minister did not. Britain
had found its role, he said.
As the lady said of other things, however: ''He would, wouldn't he?''
Mr Major, launching the debate, said few things were more damaging
than a Little Englander mentality, and warned we would have to work
harder in the future to maintain our influence and competitive position.
The domestic debate in Britain had focused far too narrowly on the
internal workings of the European Union, he said. It is a view the
Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, shares, hence the value of this sort
of look at where we should be going. It puts the Eurosceptics in their
proper context.
Mr Major recalled Dean Acheson's famous remark in 1962, that Britain
had ''lost an empire and not yet found a role'' -- a remark which hurt
at the time because it was all too true.
But Mr Major believed it true no longer. Britain had found her role in
Europe and around the world, and had developed it more successfully than
many people in this country appreciated, he said.
And he listed our assets -- our language, our culture, our overseas
investments, our armed forces, and our role in institutions like the UN,
NATO, the Commonwealth and the G7.
But those are our current assets, he warned, and if the last quarter
of a century was anything to go by, the world in 2020 would be a very
different place.
By then, Asian tigers, once Third World aid recipients, should be
prosperous players in the economic first division and that could change
the balance of political power.
In a day where there were more questions than answers, although there
were some answers, these were the issues.
* What role should we play in Europe?
* The answer the conference gave was to stop being a reluctant
partner.
* What should we do with our armed forces?
* Use them as our contribution to international peace keeping, one way
of carrying on punching above our weight and retaining our influence.
* What should our diplomats do? Did we need a Foreign Office at all.
Should it promote trade or conduct its traditional role of watching what
other countries were up to politically?
* Again a clear answer. Trade promotion was a vital part of the work
of the Foreign Service, but diplomats needed experienced back-up and
more businessmen should be seconded to help.
British business's view on membership of the European Union provided
by Mr Peter Bonfield, chairmen of the computer giant, ICL, was that we
were in danger of fatally undermining our position inside Europe,
Government dithering had a cost in trade and influence, and we should
sign up to the single currency.
Shadow Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, claimed Europe was vital to our
prosperity and we could not face the world by turning our back on it. Mr
Hurd insisted that the fundamental decision to join had been taken and
was not going to be reversed.
Part of the conference's purpose was to see ourselves as others see
us. Dr Henry Kissinger duly obliged, and reinforced the need to get our
European act together by declaring that the special relationship Britain
once enjoyed with the United States was over. He did not believe America
should convey that status on Germany. It would be helpful to neither
country.
Instead, he advocated a special relationship with Europe within which
Britain's past experience could ''make a seminal contribution.'' Another
answer to a question posed.
He also floated the idea of a North Atlantic Free Trade Organisation,
although that, as was pointed out later, holds out dreadful problems
because it would have to handle agriculture. But, as a path ahead for
British diplomacy, it offered fresh perspectives.
Organised by Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, in association with the Foreign Office, as well as key note
speeches there were four breakaway sessions dealing with Britain's
diplomatic and security role; our place in the world economy; our role
in world aid and development; and how to project British values,
education and culture.
The last provoked from the rapporteur, Sheena McDonald, the complaint
that the discussion seemed to equate culture with England, and Southern
England at that. She said the sense of demoralisation and gloom was not
necessarily shared in other parts of the United Kingdom.
The need to rediscover our self esteem was a common theme. Dr Josef
Joffe, Foreign Editor of Suddeutsche Zeitung, giving the view from
Europe, reported a conversation with two of the great and the good who
had told him -- ''We don't want to compete with you Continentals. We
just want to be left alone with our rose gardens, our hedgerows and our
Westminster.''
One did not hear this kind of self doubt in Paris, Bonn or Rome, he
said.
Mr Hurd, closing the debate, said he had never been interested in the
policy of prestige. ''The waving of flags, the coining of pretentious
phrases, the summoning of empty conferences are not what foreign policy
is about,'' he added.
* Was it an empty conference?
* It identified problems, it offered some solutions, and the consensus
was clear -- the way ahead does not require Britain to confine its
foreign policy to Europe as if there were no world elsewhere.
It is possible to punch above one's weight provided you go about it
the right way.

<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair, in a further move to occupy the political
centre ground, yesterday staked his claim for Labour to be the ''party
of the family''.
In his second keynote speech on Labour's proposed new Clause 4, he
said that after 15 years of increasing social and economic insecurity,
the Conservatives had forfeited any claim to speak for the family.
Mr Blair sought to build on his recent speech in which he set out the
importance of the individual's responsibilities to society.
He said that it was within the context of the family that these values
had to be developed and cultivated.
''I have no doubt at all that the family is and will remain the
essential foundation of a strong and stable society,'' he told a
conference in London organised by She magazine
''It is vital that we bring up children with a clear view of right and
wrong, with a clear understanding that the rights they enjoy reflect the
duties they owe.
''These values are not merely intuitive. They are taught and learnt
and the first place of learning is the family.''
It was in the family that people learned to take account of others and
to understand the necessary boundaries of their own freedom.
''It is largely from family discipline that social discipline and a
sense of responsibility are learnt. It is in the family that the sense
of community is born.''
Mr Blair's speech was being portrayed last night by his aides as part
of Labour's drive to woo back traditional supporters who deserted the
party in the 1980s.
He said he wanted to break the inhibition which had existed on the
left about discussing the family because of the view that individual
lifestyles could not be constrained by a particular social unit.
The result had been effectively to abandon a crucial area of social
policy to the Conservatives.
''The right, meanwhile, merely mouthed platitudes about 'family
values' with the result that an area of profound importance to the
foundations of our society was left virtually unhabited by policy or
strategy,'' he said.
However, the record of the Conservatives in office showed, he said,
that in reality they had forfeited any claim to be considered the party
of the family.
Under the Tories the rise in the tax burden on families with children
had been sharper than for other groups, while the benefits system
penalised wives who wanted to work if their husbands lost their jobs.
''In particular, the Tories are failing the family in one essential
area of modern life: how women are able to balance responsibility for
their family with their desire and often necessity to work.''
Sources close to the Labour leader said he had deliberately not set
out to present a ''politically correct'' view of women's issues.
Instead, he emphasised the role of the working mother, juggling the
demands of holding down a job while trying to run the family.
''It is women, more than men, who face more and greater pressures.
Often working, sometimes with two jobs, but looking after home and
children too,'' he said.
He pledged that a Labour Government would introduce a flexible
benefits system to make it easier for women to take jobs if their
husbands became unemployed.
Mr Blair also promised specific programmes for single mothers to give
them the training and back-up necessary to get back into work and a
commitment to ''quality'' childcare and nursery provision.

A CONVICTED child killer who studied neuro-surgery in his prison to
prove he was innocent of his step-daughter's murder could soon be freed.
Kevin Callan, 36, corresponded with experts around the world from
Wakefield jail, where he has served three years of his life sentence for
shaking to death Amanda Allman at their home in Hyde, Tameside, Greater
Manchester.
Now two eminent pathologists have provided evidence supporting
Callan's claim that the little girl could have suffered two brain
haemorrhages in a fall from a slide.
He claimed he had found her unconscious in the bathroom and tried to
revive her with the kiss of life. The girl's mother Lesley told his
trial that he was a good father who had been kind to Amanda.
After being jailed at Manchester Crown Court, Callan studied medical
books to give him enough knowledge to exchange letters with the experts.
He persuaded them to look at evidence given by Home Office pathologist
Dr Geoffrey Garrett, now retired, who said that Callan had probably
shaken the child to death.
A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said yesterday: ''As a result of
a comprehensive review of expert medical evidence in this case the CPS
have decided that it would not be appropriate to oppose Mr Callan's
appeal.''
The Court of Appeal will probably hear the case next month.

EXCLUSIVE
FORMER Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart plans to visit Libya
late next week in an effort to resolve the stalemate surrounding the
case of the two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing.
Final details of a potentially delicate trip have yet to be worked
out, but Mr Stewart hopes to fly to Tripoli next Friday, the day after
the Scottish local government elections.
The Eastwood Tory MP, who has taken an active interest in Lockerbie
since his resignation last month, intends to explain to the Libyan
Government his proposal for a Scottish court and jury to sit in a third
country.
Two weeks ago, Mr Stewart tabled an additional clause to the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Bill which would change the law to allow a Scottish
court and jury to sit abroad for the purpose of trying the two accused
in the Lockerbie case.
Scottish and American prosecutors have issued warrants for the arrest
of two Libyans, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi, in
connection with the deaths of the 270 people killed when a bomb
destroyed PanAm flight 103 on December 21, 1988.
However, Libya has refused to surrender the two, claiming they would
not receive a fair trial in either Scotland or the United States. Libya
has offered to send them for trial at The Hague, but the Government has
refused. The UN has imposed sanctions on Libya in an effort to force
compliance.
Mr Stewart will be accompanied by Mr Tufail Shaheen, a prominent
Glasgow businesman with close ties with Libya. Businessmen in his
constituency have told Mr Stewart that sanctions are damaging Britain's
commercial links with Libya.
He has discussed the visit with the Foreign Office, and has received a
letter from Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd emphasising that he will
travel in his personal capacity as an MP. ''I will not go as a
messenger,'' he said.
He has stood ready to visit Libya since he declared his doubts in the
Government's case against the two Libyans. He has expressed sympathy for
the campaign led by some of the Lockerbie relatives for a full inquiry
into allegations that the bombing was the work of Iranian-backed
terrorists.
Last night, Mr Stewart said: ''There has been a positive reaction to
the proposals I am putting forward. It has been put to me that a visit
to Libya could be productive.
''Obviously there is work on the visit to be done yet. I would only
look to go to Libya if I was confident that there would be the
possibility of a constructive outcome.''
Current plans call for him to spend several days in Libya and to meet
Libyan officials at the highest level. A meeting with Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi has not been ruled out.

<HEADLINE>Lang accused of sacrificing integrity over figures.  Ashdown poses a taxing question</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang was accused by Liberal Democrat leader
Paddy Ashdown of sacrificing his political integrity to peddle scare
stories about the cost of a Parliament in Edinburgh.
He revealed that House of Commons library staff had retrieved
statistics at the request of Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Mr Jim
Wallace which proved that the Conservatives were wrong to claim that the
Scots raised less tax revenue per capita than the rest of Britain.
Speaking in Edinburgh before addressing members of the business
community, Mr Ashdown revealed statistics which appeared to demonstrate
that, with 8.8% of the population, Scotland raised 8.9% of revenues to
the Exchequer, in contrast to recent Tory claims that only 8.3% was
raised north of the Border.
''I have respect for Ian Lang and consider he has greater integrity
than most Conservative politicians, but this has damaged him,'' he said.
''The scaremongering that has been put about by the Conservatives
about the cost of a Scottish Parliament is hogwash. When a decent man
like Ian Lang is prepared to sacrifice his integrity by peddling the
sort of nonsense of the last week, we see the state we have come to.''
Mr Lang started his campaign on the theme in February on the day of
the much-publicised debate between Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson and SNP leader Alex Salmond. A statement issued by him cited
income tax, national insurance, VAT and local revenues, which totalled
8.3% of UK revenue raised and claimed: ''We raise less than our
population share.''
Mr Wallace distrusted the figures and asked staff at the House of
Commons library to study other revenues and found a different picture.
Under a total of 20 categories, including these four, they found a
number where Scotland raises well over the per capita average. The most
obvious was oil and gas revenues, with 85% of the #1300m coming from
Scottish waters.
Others where Scotland more than pulled its weight were non-oil
corporation tax (9%); tobacco duties (11.6%); alcohol duties (9.1%) and
the community charge (10.1%). The total share of 8.9% for 1992-93 was a
fraction higher than the population share.
''Ian Lang seems to think that only income tax, national insurance,
VAT and local revenue should be included,'' said Mr Wallace. ''This
approach appears to us to be bizarrely selective, calculated to give a
misleading impression.''
Mr Ashdown last night addressed Scottish People in Business, a new
organisation representing commerce on a non-party political basis. He
told them: ''The Scottish people want more control over their own
affairs and quite right too. I do not believe they will be deflected by
Tory scaremongering.''
He said people in business were looking for a longer-term view,
investment in infrastructure, less bureaucracy, greater stability, and a
clear commitment to Europe. ''But in every single area, British
governments of all political colours have consistently failed to deliver
the goods, and business has suffered as a result,'' he said.
A Whitehall source last night said the figures Mr Lang used came from
the Treasury and were simply updates of the fuller figures published in
Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland 1991-92.
Earlier, in Aberdeen, Mr Ashdown expressed sympathy for the Canadians
in their fishing row with Spain and called for the renegotiation of the
Common Fisheries Policy and an international framework to resolve
similar issues.
But he said that a narrow Scottish view was no remedy to any problem,
fishing or otherwise.

BARBARA Cartland is selling her jewels. The record-breaking author of
615 novels was at Sotheby's yesterday announcing a sale to take place in
London on June 22.
But Dame Barbara's pearls, sapphires and diamonds, as well as a
necklace, brooch, bracelet and ring of enormous square-cut aquamarine,
valued at a total of #80,000, will first be taken on a world tour to
Sotheby's offices in Paris, New York, Vienna, Geneva, Rome, Milan and
Amsterdam -- a few of the countries where Barbara Cartland's books (she
now produces 23 per year) are published in at least 24 languages,
including Korean, Malay, Indonesian and Icelandic.
''Jewellery is like having a kiss, something marvellous,'' Dame
Barbara declared, explaining her reason for selling: ''I don't go out at
night now -- I'm 93 you know, nearly 94. There simply aren't the grand
parties there used to be.''
''I'm on television all day and every day, and on TV it's much better
to have this stuff,'' she said, indicating the flashy costume jewellery
which she will not be selling.
''Besides, it's almost too dangerous to wear jewellery today. I've
already had one major robbery,'' she added.
Does she need the money? ''Everyone needs money,'' replied the Dame
who was awarded her DBE by the Queen in 1991 for her many works for
charity, including over 50 years with the St John's Ambulance Brigade.
The pieces of jewellery to be sold all have special memories for her,
Dame Barbara said. ''It was all given to me. Naturally, people gave one
lovely presents if one was having an affair -- I've had 56 proposals of
marriage, you know. But all the men I've loved are dead now.''
The names of her suitors however -- apart from her two husbands,
Alexander and Hugh McCorquodale, who were related to each other -- will
not be given in the catalogue, she said.
Dame Barbara stays in Scotland every summer with her son and manager
Mr Ian McCorquodale, former chairman of Debretts Peerage, the publishers
of Who's Who -- where his mother held the record for the longest entry.
''My jewellery has brought me tremendous luck and tremendous
happiness,'' Dame Barbara said, after vivaciously decrying the modern
evils of divorce, drugs, ''sex, sex, sex'' and the lack of prayer. ''The
jewellery will bring luck to the people who buy it, I'm sure.''

IN A British consular office in Tanzania, the only films available
were of the Royal Wedding and Country Pastimes in Devon, Mr Paul Flynn
(Newport West -- Lab.) complained to the Foreign Office team yesterday.
Time did not permit him to reveal if the wedding in question was that
of our present monarch, the Queen Mother, or King Edward VII and Queen
Alexandra. One felt pretty sure that hunt saboteurs had not been
starring in the other.
Mr Flynn, who had been tipped off by a constituent, was indignant but
the Tories cheered. The two films would give an impressive, if
admittedly misleading view of life in Britain in the 1990s they seemed
to feel.
Foreign Office questions is usually nowadays a rather melancholy trawl
around the world's trouble spots in which Ministers keep on saying
things like ''We are rather concerned about human rights in Ethiopia'',
where it appears political opponents of the interim government keep
disappearing, an indication perhaps that the interim government is
ambitious to become permanent.
Trade with Latin America is going terrifically well, we are providing
Yasser Arafat with police vans, and undertaking what Under-Secretary
Tony Baldry called ''preventative diplomacy'' in Rwanda.
The Sketch is not mocking this. Much good work is being done and,
heaven knows, the more trade we do with Latin America the better. But it
is still a far cry from the heady days of Empire, the Pax Britannica and
Lord Palmerston's gunboat.
Had Mr Douglas Hurd been around in those days, one is not saying he
would not have sent a gunboat somewhere, only that he would not have
enjoyed doing so as much as Lord Palmerston. The Mahdi or the Dragon
Lady Empress of China would have been invited to talk things over and
asked if they really wanted a gunboat or a battalion or two sorting out
the problem.
Jingoism, one feels, offends Mr Hurd as much as it did the likes of Mr
Gladstone, and when Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay -- Con.) produced a
phrase almost unused since the demise of Mr Ian Smith's administration,
a shadow briefly crossed that diplomatically bland face.
Mrs Gorman had the bad taste or right feeling to refer to the
Canadians as our ''kith and kin'' and quite a few Tories lacked enough
political correctness to cheer this.
They had managed to restrain themselves when the Rev Martin Smyth
(Belfast South -- Ulster Unionist) suggested that the Prime Minister
should point out to President Clinton that 60% of the Irish-Americans
for whose vote he is sucking up to Gerry Adams, are actually of
Scots-Irish extraction, so that his efforts could turn out to be
counter-productive.
Mrs Gorman, a good judge, said the language being used by EU Fisheries
Commissioner Emma Bonino was ''intemperate''. This was something about
which the Foreign Office could take a firm line.
''We must avoid and discourage intemperate language,'' said Mr Hurd
and, warming to his theme, called on both Canadians and Spaniards to
show ''restraint''. A lot of Tory back benchers seemed not over the moon
about this even-handed approach, but the Speaker moved us on to less
troubled waters.
At the end, unwhipped Conservative Tony Marlow (Northampton North)
pointed out that in the hour only one question on European Union affairs
had been answered. At one time, this possible quirk of the system by
which questions submitted are ''picked out of the hat'' at random, was
circumvented in the case of Europe by allocating 20 minutes of Foreign
Office time purely to that subject.
The Speaker suggested that Mr Marlow contact the Procedure Committee
which could recommend the restoration of European questions for decision
by the House as a whole. One can think of few reforms more likely to
encourage that intemperate language and lack of restraint which Mr Hurd
had just deprecated. The Sketch is all for it.

PAISLEY Labour MP Gordon McMaster yesterday put himself in the
forefront of the anti-drugs campaign in his constituency.
In a bold move, given cautious backing by the Government, he said he
would be prepared to act as an intermediary between the police and
members of the public who came forward with information about drug
dealers.
Mr McMaster yesterday met Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of
Carmyllie to put forward a 12-point plan aimed at getting drugs off the
streets in Paisley.
As immediate action, the Minister has agreed to consider whether
further guidance on the prescription of Temazepam would be appropriate
and also to discuss with other Ministers the classification of the drug.
Mr McMaster wants more police on the streets and the law on shotguns
tightened. He intends to introduce a Bill on the matter and is seeking
the support of the Government.
He wants police resources to offer ''real and adequate'' protection
for people who come forward with evidence, but he said bluntly: ''If any
of my constituents prefer to use me as an intermediary with the police I
will not hesitate to help.''
His initiative follows a spate of recent incidents in the Paisley area
and a threat to his parliamentary colleague, Paisley North MP Irene
Adams, but Mr McMaster yesterday made clear his determination.
He said his meeting with Lord Fraser had been ''very positive,'' and
continued: ''There is a commitment that the Government will be
supporting the local community in trying to deal with the problem.
''We cannot be intimidated. If you take on this job you have certain
responsibilities and duties and you cannot be intimidated. Paisley is
still a great town and this does not reflect what it is really about.
But there is a problem that has to be dealt with.''
The Scottish Office said it had been a very useful meeting and its
spokesman, added: ''Although some of the proposals discussed were
operational matters for the police, Lord Fraser welcomes any efforts to
tackle this problem.
''The Minister wholeheartedly supports the efforts of Strathclyde
police and urged members of the public to assist the police in bringing
the perpetrators to justice.
''Lord Fraser said he would take advice on the concerns raised about
shotguns but emphasised that any measures to change legislation would
have to be done on a nationwide basis.''

The Scottish Office said last night that Ministers were keeping an
open mind on the funding of the final phase of the redevelopment of
Hampden Park.
A delegation from the all-party Scottish Sports Group met Scottish
Office Minister Sir Hector Monro in a bid to ensure that money from the
''Millennium Fund'' would go to the stadium.
Labour MP Dennis Canavan, convener of the group, said: ''A century ago
Scotland led the way with the construction of Hampden Park, at that time
the most advanced football stadium in the world.
''Now Scotland can lead the way into a new millenium with a modern
national football stadium of which the people of Scotland can be proud.
''The project involves much more than a football stadium.
''It will provide a range of cultural, leisure and community
facilities which will be a great national asset and make a substantial
contribution to the Scottish economy.''
Mr Canavan said his group had put forward a positive case.
Last night, the Scottish Office said it had taken on board what he had
said, but without commitment.

The girl, who managed to break free immediately and ran home and
alerted her parents, had been playing at the rear of the flats shortly
before the attack. Police said yesterday a man fitting the girl's
description of her attacker was seen loitering near the flats two hours
before the incident. He is aged 20 to 25, 5ft 8in, stocky build, with
short, brown, curly hair, and wore a blue, waist-length jacket, and

FLEXIBILITY is the key to successful business in increasingly
competitive world markets, delegates to a conference in Ayrshire will
hear next week.
The conference on human resources development, organised by Enterprise
Ayrshire in association with The Herald, is the first of its kind in
Scotland and has attracted top level speakers.
The keynote address will come from management expert Richard Tanner
Pascale who warns that excellence will only be sustained if senior
management continually challenges all the assumptions and breaks the
conventional pattern, even when things are going well.
Delegates at the Turnberry Hotel next Wednesday and Thursday will also
hear from Mr David Bower of the Rover Group, Mr Garth Heron of United
Distillers, the Clydesdale Bank's Mr Pat Lennon and STUC General
Secretary Mr Campbell Christie.
The conference theme, The Flexible Enterprise, is an approach already
adopted by two highly successful Ayrshire companies which will have
representatives at Turnberry.
Mr Charlie Quinn, executive manager for human resources development at
the Volvo truck and bus plant in Irvine, said: ''We are operating in a
highly competitive market worldwide and in order to stay that vital one
step ahead we have had to be flexible.
''Our most valuable resource is our people and if they are not
flexible then we cannot respond to the needs of our customers. One of
the things which we are best known for in the industry is our ability to
meet the specialised needs of customers in all of the markets in which
we operate.
''Over the past 20 years we have seen the workforce at Irvine grow to
470 and every one of these people is flexible with special skills with
which we are ready to respond quickly to demands from potential
clients.''
Mr Sam Thomson, HRD manager at the Aviall Caledonian aircraft engine
servicing plant at Prestwick, said: ''There have been huge changes in
the way businesses are run in recent years. We have seen de-layering,
the removal of hierarchy and the introduction of flexible working
practices.''
Aviall Caledonian, which works closely with neighbours Jetstream in
the training of apprentices, is seeking new business in the growing
Asian and Eastern European markets.
Mr Thomson added: ''Next week's conference is an excellent opportunity
to learn what other companies are doing in HRD. We can share ideas and
hopefully take back new ones . . .''
Mr Alistair McFadzean, head of company development at Enterprise
Ayrshire, said: ''The conference has attracted interest from the North
of England and all of Scotland and I am confident that there will be
lessons and information for everyone.''

A PROPAGANDA war involving all four main Scottish parties broke out at
Westminster yesterday in the build-up to next week's local council
elections.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, his Labour Shadow George Robertson, and
senior spokesmen from both the Liberal Democrats and the SNP were
involved in angry exchanges as the Scottish Grand Committee debated a
range of issues.
Mr Lang, who opened debate on the council tax, said it had quickly
established itself as a stable and effective method of raising local
taxpayers' contributions to the cost of delivering local services.
He told the committee: ''That is why local council taxpayers should
scrutinise the council tax record of their councils before casting their
vote on April 6.''
Labour Front Bench spokeswoman Maria Fyfe condemned Mr Lang for
displaying a lack of conviction and reminded him that the Tories were
the party that had introduced the poll tax.
SNP leader Alex Salmond argued that, in terms of value for money, the
SNP councils were ''considerably ahead'' of both Tory and Labour
councils while Liberal Democrat Archy Kirkwood said of the Tories:
''Anyone looking at their record would, by any test, conclude that they
have failed.''

<HEADLINE>Labour accuses Ministers of providing 'jobs for the boys' with quango appointments Row over selection of new water chiefs</HEADLINE>

A SENIOR Scottish Office civil servant and two regional water service
directors are expected to be named shortly as the chief executives of
Scotland's controversial new water authorities.
The three were chosen from a shortlist of five. Although a decision
has been taken, the announcement is being deferred until after next
Thursday's local elections, in order to head off political controversy.
Last night, Labour seized on the choice of a civil servant for the
#80,000-a-year post as further evidence of the Government operating a
''jobs for the boys'' policy in its quango appointments.
The selection process, involving Scottish Office Ministers, has just
been completed. The shortlist, drawn up with the assistance of outside
consultants, consisted of:Mr Alasdair Paton, director of the Scottish
Office's environment department; Mr Ernie Chambers, Strathclyde region's
director of water services; Mr Rod Rennet, director of water for Tayside
region; and two candidates from English water companies.
According to sources who have confirmed the names for The Herald, the
posts have been offered to the three Scots. Last night, Labour
questioned the choice of Mr Paton because of his potential involvement
in drawing up plans for the authorities.
Labour's George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, who
has tabled questions in the Commons on the appointments, said: ''I don't
understand how a Scottish Office civil servant, however distinguished,
has the qualifications necessary. There are other people with hands-on
experience of water and drainage who applied for it, and were clearly in
the frame.''
The North, West, and East of Scotland water authorities will take over
responsibility for running water and sewerage services from April next
year. Removing water from local authority control is one of the most
contentious issues of local government reorganisation.
Opposition parties argue that the boards are unaccountable and
unelected, and so make a mockery of democratic accountability.
Mr Foulkes, contrasting the selection of the chief executives with the
new unitary authorities, said: ''Next Thursday we will elect councillors
who will then democratically choose their new chief executives.
''With the water authorities, the chief executive is chosen by the
Scottish Office and then gets to choose his board. This will be seen as
jobs for the boys instead of choosing the best person for the job.''
Earlier, Mr Foulkes raised the appointments in the Scottish Grand
Committee. He was told by Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch that
his questions seeking confirmation that a civil servant is among those
chosen would be answered ''shortly''.
''The process of selection for a position such as this is a lengthy
one. That process is in its final stages, but has not yet reached its
conclusion. When it has, an announcement will be made,'' Mr Kynoch said.
Mr Paton, 50, is a Grade 3 -- under secretary -- at the Scottish
Office. He joined its environment department in 1980, from the Hong Kong
public works department. He was educated at Glasgow University and is
married with two children.
It is not known which authorities the three will be allocated. Mr
Chambers is widely respected for his work at Strathclyde, and he is seen
as a natural appointment to head the West of Scotland body.
Three weeks ago, Mr Kynoch revealed that the new chief executives will
receive salaries of #80,000 a year, plus performance-related bonuses.
Last month, the Government announced the names of the part-time chairmen
who will head the new bodies.
Dr Ian Preston, retiring chief executive of ScottishPower, will
receive #24,000 a year, for an average one-and-a-half day week heading
the East of Scotland authority.
Mr John Robertson, current head of the Highland Health Board, will
receive #40,000 a year, for a two-and-a-half day week heading the North
of Scotland authority.
Mr John Jameson, a former convenor of Dumfries and Galloway Regional
Council, will also receive #40,000 a year for a two-and-a-half day week
as chairman of the West of Scotland authority.

PARENTS and teachers have nothing to fear from the forthcoming local
government reform, and the single-tier councils taking responsibility
for education, a senior Scottish Tory said yesterday.
Mrs Astrid Ritchie, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives' education
committee, went into the lion's den to insist that reorganisation would
give councils, parents, and teachers the opportunity to think
innovatively.
Addressing a meeting, organised by the Educational Institute of
Scotland, about the forthcoming elections, she blamed the teachers'
union and local authorities for the present ''unseemly scramble''
preceding the reform. In their desire to retain the status quo, both had
lost a year in preparation time for the switch to the new councils.
Mrs Ritchie said: ''The result of burying heads in the sand is that
regions and districts have only recently started talking to one another
about collaboration and the way ahead.''
Defending the decision to remove the statutory requirement on councils
to employ directors of education and have education committees, she said
the ''old system'' was not necessarily best suited to their new
''broadbrush, enabling role.''
With all heads taking responsibility for 80% of their budgets by April
next year, schools would benefit from the budgetary freedom which the
independent sector already enjoyed, she maintained.

GLASGOW's business leaders are understood to have reversed their
stance on the future of the former Glasgow Garden Festival site and are
now backing the Glasgow Development Agency's Pacific Quay project.
It has emerged that the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce will soon announce
publicly its support of the #80m scheme, which will be carried out by
Edinburgh-based Miller Developers together with CTP Ltd, from
Manchester.
The chamber's former chairman, Mr Geoffrey Johnston, had
enthusiastically endorsed previous proposals by the Clyde Maritime Trust
for the site, aspects of which have been assimilated into a rival
proposal put forward by a private company, the Clyde Festival Gardens
1999 Ltd.
These plans are for a Tivoli Gardens-style development on the 43-acre
Clydeside site.
Yesterday Mr Geoff Runcie, chief executive of the chamber of commerce,
would neither confirm nor deny reports of the apparent U-turn.
Mr Runcie said the chamber had not fully completed its deliberations
but stressed that Mr Johnston's approval, had been for the Maritime
Trust's plans, which differ from those now being put forward by the
Clyde Festival Gardens 1999.
The chamber brought both the GDA and the private company together at
their Glasgow headquarters earlier this month for a head-to-head
meeting, which is understood to have done nothing to resolve the row.
The conflict could escalate over the next few months as both companies
have submitted applications to Glasgow District Council for outline
planning permission.
However no date has yet been set for the applications to be heard and
it is thought this could be delayed until weeks after the local
elections.

The Scottish National Party said yesterday it was the radical force
for change, and Labour had become very much a conservative force in
Scottish politics.
Dr Allan Macartney, deputy leader of the party, said the SNP would
contest 86% of the seats against 43% in the 1984 district council
elections and would field a record number of 998 candidates, about 50
more than Labour.
To display its experience in local government, the SNP yesterday
convened a gathering of civic and political leaders from across Scotland
at its headquarters in Edinburgh.
This included Councillor Norman Irons, Lord Provost of Edinburgh;
Provost James McGinlay, West Lothian District Council; Provost Danny
Coffey, Kilmarnock and Loudoun District Council; and Councillor Ewen
Dow, leader of Tayside Regional Council.
Dr Macartney said success at local government level had been an
important part of the SNP's political and organisational growth in
recent years.
The consistently anti-Scottish approach of the Tories had made them a
marginal force in local communities, he said.
Councillor Maureen Watt, the party's vice-convener for local
government, said the SNP offered Scotland a ''Fresh Start''. This
covered eight principles: water, local services, open local government,
fuel poverty, concessionary travel, housing, nursery education, and
economic development.

PETROL on sale in Glasgow has the highest levels in the UK of the
cancer-causing agent benzene, a petrol additive company claimed
yesterday.
Associated Octel, the world's principal supplier of the lead additive
in leaded petrol, published the findings in support of its campaign to
slow the change to lead-free fuel.
By implication, most of the petrol sold in Scotland -- which
originates, regardless of brand, from BP's refinery at Grangemouth --
would be at similar levels to Glasgow.
The survey, based on samples from six petrol stations, showed benzene
at 2.6% compared with a UK average of 2%, and higher than found in
surveys in London, Birmingham and Southampton.
This is also double the level in leaded petrol.
However, the claims were dismissed as alarmist by the oil industry,
which said that lead levels in petrol were still regarded as dangerously
high.
It is accepted that the most environmentally-friendly petrol-driven
car uses unleaded petrol and is equipped with a catalytic converter to
cut down harmful emissions.
The converters are compulsory on all cars built after 1993 so it will
be some years before every car on the road has one.
Lead is put in petrol to prevent engine knocking; benzene and other
aromatics are used as a substitute.
Octel's Medical Officer, Dr David Gidlow, argued in Glasgow yesterday
that the Government had been too hasty when they bowed to pressure in
1983 to promote unleaded petrol ahead of the widespread use of
catalysers.
''At the moment 60% of the fuel used in Britain is unleaded and only
18% of cars are fitted with catalysers. That means that 40% are using
unleaded petrol and don't have catalysers,'' he said.
''If they went back to using leaded petrol there would be a 20%
reduction in emission levels.''
The strongest evidence linking benzene to leukaemia and other cancers
has come as a result of high occupational exposures.
Dr Gidlow and his colleagues admitted they had a vested interest in a
reversion to leaded petrol.
But they said that any benefit would be transient, pending the
universal use of catalysers after the next 10 years.
They also said they had diversified into other petroleum additives
anyway.
However, lead still appeared to be the only significant product line
industry sources associated with the company yesterday, and they still
have a lot to play for in some Asian countries where leaded petrol is
still a major seller.
A spokesman for BP said that the benzene levels in Grangemouth petrol
were about 2.5%, which is the UK average according to more detailed
industry figures, and half the maximum permitted by law.
''Octel are the only people trying to open a debate which is now
closed -- oil companies, the Government, environment groups, all support
the move to unleaded petrol.''

A HOSPITAL consultant rapped for not doing more to find a bed for a
dying man hit back at his critics last night, saying he was ''appalled''
at his treatment.
Orthopaedic surgeon Mr Anthony Percy, head of accident and emergency
at Queen Mary's Hospital, in Sidcup, Kent, spoke out as he defended the
eventual decision to airlift the man 200 miles for treatment.
He was backed by the junior doctor on duty at the time, who was left
to ring 14 hospitals in the battle to find a bed. Dr Alex Velthuysen, a
South African, had only been working in Britain for six weeks.
Accident victim Mr Malcolm Murray, 46, was flown from south London to
Leeds. He went for 10 hours without treatment during the search for an
intensive care bed and died the next day from brain injuries.
A consultant brain surgeon who operated on Mr Murray said that
immediate attention would have ''better servedthe patient''.
An investigation into the case by South Thames health chiefs concluded
yesterday that Mr Percy could have made a ''significant difference'' in
the effort to find a bed.
In a statement last night, Mr Percy said: ''I am appalled at the the
criticism being levelled at Queen Mary's and myself. The trauma team
spent almost the whole of the night trying to find a suitable bed and
were simply unable to do so.''
Poor referral systems between hospitals and lack of co-ordination of
beds between neuro-science centres are highlighted in a report which
shows that Mr Percy was contacted three times by Mr Velthuysen. On the
second occasion, Mr Velthuysen had rung 10 hospitals in the London area
without success.
The report claims that, with hindsight, this should have been a
trigger for action by a senior member of staff.
An internal investigation by staff at Queen Mary's attached to the
inquiry report praises the actions of Mr Velthuysen, saying he was
''well in control of events, and committed to securing the best care he
could for the patient''.
By contrast, Mr Percy could have done more when the junior doctor rang
him at home for advice two hours later. It was the second of three calls
and Mr Velthuysen had rung the 10 hospitals without success.
South Thames Health authority chairman Mr William Wells said: ''The
panel are of the view that the direct involvement of the senior
clinician in pursuing the referral could have made a difference.''
Consultants said the job of ringing round trying to find a bed was one
for managers, not doctors.
Mr Jim Johnson, chairman of the British Medical Association's
consultants' committee, said: ''This is an administrative responsibility
which should be resolved between hospital managers.''

PLANS to let the private sector build, own, and operate water services
will cost Scotland's two million households an extra #234 on water
bills, according to Labour, and could result in a legal challenge to the
Government.
It claims the increase will be needed to pay for 11 proposed sewerage
treatment centres across the country in what amounted to privatisation
of Scotland's water industry ''by the back door''.
The centres would be established following the implementation next
year of the new water boards.
Mr John McFall, Labour's Scottish economic spokesperson, and council
chiefs from the Labour-controlled Strathclyde Regional Council, said an
independent report showed the 11 Build Own and Operate (BOO) schemes
would cost #486m more than they would under the public sector. The
schemes use private finance to build water and sewerage plants.
The Government described the claims as ''a scare story too far''.
Regional Councillor Des McNulty, who is dealing with local government
reorganisation, said: ''The Government does not seem to be the subject
of the same process of scrutiny as local authorities when it comes to
doing things in the cheapest and most effective way.''
He argued that local authorities could raise the necessary funds more
cheaply if the Government relaxed borrowing restraints and claimed the
BOO schemes amounted to a ''blatant example of additional unnecessary
expenditure''.
Councillor McNulty said: ''If the Government doesn't alter its
position and allow us to go down the most cost effective route in
meeting EU requirements on sewerage and water purity from the point of
view of the consumer, then we will have to consider mounting a judicial
challenge.''
He added: ''The BOO schemes will cost every household in Scotland an
average of #234 extra. That is a very substantial amount of money to be
paying for ideology or dogma.''
The extra cost, Labour claims, stems primarily from the fact that
private operators could not command the low interest rates available to
councils, and because of their commitments to shareholders.
The figures are based on a report commissioned by the region from the
private sector Chemical Bank. The report has shown the BOO schemes would
''fail any reasonable value for money test'' and that the plans would
also impose an ''excessive and unnecessary burden on ratepayers''.
Council leader Bob Gould has sent copies of the report to the Prime
Minister, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, and Scottish Local Government
Minister, Mr George Kynoch, outlining the council's concerns.
Mr McFall joined Councillor McNulty and Councillor Gould yesterday at
a news conference at the region-operated Muirdykes Water Works, in
Howwood, Renfrewshire.
Mr McFall said: ''Labour is in favour of working partnerships between
the public and private sectors where appropriate. The BOO schemes are
not so much a public and private partnership, as a case of highway
robbery with Scottish Secretary Ian Lang holding a gun at the heads of
Scottish consumers.''
Mr Kynoch said: ''The Labour Party has gone a scare story too far with
its latest claims on Scottish water.
''The report commissioned by Strathclyde region and used by Labour has
already been exposed as fundamentally flawed because of the blinkered
assumptions it contains.''
He said ''Strathclyde should allow BOO investors to come up with their
own cost-effective solutions''.

THE pendulum of employment in Scotland took an upward swing yesterday
with the announcement of 270 new jobs in Port Glasgow, together with
news of a new Littlewoods store for Irvine, bringing up to 100 jobs to
the Ayrshire town.
The Port Glasgow jobs will be provided by a three-year expansion of
the town's AMP electronics factory, which will take the total number
employed at the American multinational's only Scottish plant to 580.
A company spokesman said it was investing #13.6m in the growth of the
unit, which produces connectors for the domestic and industrial
electronics industry.
AMP receives assistance from the inward investment agency, Locate in
Scotland, and Renfrewshire Enterprise for the project.
The location of a Littlewoods department store in Irvine is part of a
UK-wide expansion creating 2000 jobs in the company's retail division.
It hopes to open the store by the end of the year.
Recruitment, with 500 new starts in Merseyside, will continue
throughout 1995. They will, however, be balanced by the 500 redundancies
the company recently announced in its pools business, which has been
severely disrupted by competition from the National Lottery.
The news came on the same day the company released its figures for
1994. Profits were slightly down from the 1993 record high of #117.2m,
coming in at #116m.
The Littlewoods move was balanced by the shedding of 1200 jobs by the
UK-Dutch oil company Shell from its head offices in London and The
Hague.
The cuts, which a spokesperson insisted would not affect Shell's
activities in Scotland, represent 30% of the current 4000 staff employed
in the multinational's services division. They follow a review of the
group's head office functions, started in September last year.
Meanwhile Scotland's engineering industry is said to be in its best
competitive shape since the recession began to bottom out more than a
year ago, according to the latest quarterly survey by the employers'
federation.
It reports a steady build-up of orders and confidence over the last 15
months and predicts increasing signs of recovery in all sectors.
But Mr Howard Jordan, Scottish Engineering's chief executive, warned
yesterday that it was vital that the Government acknowledged the need
for tax relief on increased capital investment in its autumn budget if
that growth was to continue.
He said: ''We need inflation-proofing of allowances for capital
equipment investment at the very least. Modernisation of equipment and
productivity techniques is what has helped pull us out of recession.
''The Government must also recognise that there are small and
medium-sized companies whose investment needs are less dramatic than
those of the big boys. Major allowances on capital investment up to
#100,000 would help tremendously.''
He added that, despite spiralling costs for raw materials such as
steel and unavoidable price rises in all engineering sectors, Scotland's
competitiveness remained high abroad, particularly in Europe.
''It is particularly encouraging to see heavy engineering begin to
pick up after a long time in the doldrums,'' he said. ''And optimism
everywhere is reflected in the fact that companies are optimistic enough
to begin recruiting on a steady basis.''
He added that the two major redundancies in the last quarter at
Rolls-Royce and John Brown Engineering ''were out of the norm''.

LABOUR expressed fears last night that the BBC had caved in to Tory
pressure over a high-profile television interview with Mr Major on the
eve of the elections.
A leaked internal BBC memorandum obtained by The Times shows how BBC
executives proposed to defend the screening of the interview on Monday's
Panorama.
The BBC confirmed the memorandum was genuine but insisted it was drawn
up last Friday, before the current Government onslaught on the
Corporation.
The memo, by Panorama deputy editor Nick Robinson, discusses how the
BBC can justify giving so much airtime to Mr Major so close to the
elections without allowing the other party leaders similar air time.
''This is particularly important given that the interview is bound to
be written up as forming part of a No 10 strategy to promote Major in
advance of both the elections and the (parliamentary) Easter recess. It
comes less than a week after high profile speeches,'' it said.
''My suggestion is that we say that we have had a bid in for the Prime
Minister for some months which he has finally accepted: that this is an
interesting time to interview him since it comes in advance of the
beginning of Maastricht 2 process, his visit to the United States and
the imminent talks between the Government and Sinn Fein; and given the
Government's continuing unpopularity and disarray.''

SCOTLAND'S first Centre for Women's Health was opened in Glasgow
yesterday by Scottish Writer of the Year Janice Galloway.
The centre will provide information and counselling on all areas of
women's physical and mental health and aims to involve women in
improving their own health by forming self-help groups.
Rosie Ilett, the centre co-ordinator said: ''We will take a
non-medicalised view of women's health, one that integrates all aspects
of women's lives that affect their health.''
Councillor Louise Fyfe, Glasgow district council chair for the centre,
said: ''This is not just about breast screening, it is not just about
cervical smears, but about fighting poverty and allowing women to be
themselves. This centre will encourage women to feel that they can have
more of a say in what happens in their lives.''
Janice Galloway identified information as women's best means of
empowering themselves and was particularly impressed by the centre's
library.
''For too long patient information has been controlled with the
assumption that nurses and doctors know best. Women will save a lot of
time and bus fares by coming here to get a share of this insider
knowledge,'' she said.
Volunteer Gemma Keay said: ''Doctors do not have time for the sort of
support this centre will give.
''Inquiries are often unrecognised or there is nowhere to direct the
women to. Women will come together here to tackle problems such as
eating disorders, emotional and stress management.''
Priority is to be given to the needs of disabled women, lesbians and
women from black ethnic minority groups.
The centre is at Sandyford Place, in Sauchiehall Street.

THE demand for educational provision and day-care for Scotland's
under-fives is likely to continue and expand, according to a report
commissioned by the Scottish Office.
It contains the findings of a two-year study carried out by the
Scottish Council for Research in Education into the variety of
provision, how it relates to the schools programme for children aged
five to 14, and provision for youngsters with special needs.
The report, one of the latest in the Interchange series of research
summaries, says that evidence indicates that, overall, provision for
pre-fives and the opening hours of centres are not sufficient to meet
parents' current needs.
''In particular, the needs of working parents need to be addressed to
ensure that sufficient services extend beyond the normal school day and
year, to cover evenings, weekends, and holidays,'' the authors point
out.
The report calls for further exploration of the effects of multiple
types of care outside the home for young children, ''especially the
crucial role played by childminders''.
It also says that more needs to be known about the needs and
preferences of parents whose children were not involved in some
pre-school provision.

THE Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday urged
Turkey to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq.
But it emerged that RAF aircraft help provide detailed reconnaissance
pictures of the region to which Turkey, as a joint member of Operation
Provide Comfort to protect Kurds, has access.
Opposition defence spokesman Dr David Clark expressed concern about
the revelation that British surveillance may be aiding the Turkish
operation.
Some 35,000 Turkish troops, backed by warplanes and tanks, have
crossed the border to strike at bases of the Kurdistan Workers' Party,
known as the PKK.
At the Britain in the World conference in London, the Prime Minister
insisted that the UK's commitment to the Kurds of northern Iraq had not
diminished.
''I understand Turkish concerns about PKK terrorism. But Turkey should
remain within the rule of law.
''We look to Turkey to withdraw its forces as soon as possible and to
avoid harm to non-combatants and relief efforts,'' Mr Major told the
conference.
RAF Harrier GR7 jump-jets and French Jaguars carry out daily
photographic sweeps of the region as part of their operation to enforce
the no-fly zone imposed at the end of the Gulf war.
This information is shared with Turkish military officers.
Further information is available from the Nato airborne early-warning
radar aircraft which also patrol the area.
All tactical and operational information is shared with the Turks at
the Combined Task Force HQ for Operation Provide Comfort at the Incirlik
air base.
Turkish officers serve in all of the departments and at all levels in
the HQ.
The MoD said Turkish officers did not have ''routine access'' to
photo-reconnaissance, although it acknowledged Turkey was represented at
the Combined Task Force HQ.
But a spokesman refused to say whether the Turks had access to the
information at various times.
''We accept Turkey is facing a major threat from the PKK in terms of
terrorism,'' he said. ''We hope Turkey will make every effort to ensure
there are no civilian casualties.
''We expect them to withdraw as soon as they have achieved their
objective.''
Shadow Defence Secretary Dr Clark expressed concern about the
reconnaissance information.
''I hope the Turks do not have access to these pictures, because
obviously we should not be party to their action against the Kurds,'' he
said.
But he said without access to Turkish airfields, Nato could not
enforce the no-fly zone which was preventing Iraq from persecuting the
civilian Kurdish population.
At Commons question time, Liberal Democrat spokesman Menzies Campbell
asked Mr Hurd: ''What assessment have you made of the consequences for
the lives of those living in northern Iraq of the current military
intervention by Turkey?
''What pressure are you bringing on Turkey, a fellow member of Nato,
to discontinue that military action as soon as possible?''
Mr Hurd noted Mr Major's remarks at the conference and continued: ''I
have sent a message to the new Turkish foreign minister stressing our
concern and hoping that they will bring this military operation to an
end and withdraw their troops at the earliest opportunity.''

THE Scottish textile industry, producing exports worth #433m, has a
future in world markets despite the recent bleak news that major player
Dawson International is to axe 400 jobs, it was claimed yesterday.
Industry expert and adviser to Scottish Enterprise, Mr Alex McCluskie,
who is currently involved in the setting up of a national strategy for
the textile trade, said he was confident there was strength and
diversity in Scotland, which, coupled with quality of products, would
ensure a future.
His optimism came as six-figure pay-offs for the deposed Dawson
International management were criticised as disgraceful by a senior
councillor in one of the areas hit by redundancies.
Councillor John Dorward, Tayside region's economic development
convener, responded angrily to reports that, following a boardroom
shake-up, the chairman and the managing director would each receive
#300,000 pay-offs.
He said: ''I find it absolutely disgraceful that the deposed top
management, who appear to have made decisions which contributed to the
company's present predicament, will receive a golden handshake, while a
dedicated workforce receives its marching orders.''
Mr McCluskie said the problems facing textile producers were the
result of ''globalisation'', with the biggest challenge emerging from
the Far East.
''China, the source of our imported cashmere, has moved quickly into
the world market, producing its own garments at prices a third less than
Scottish manufacturers.
''Bear in mind that Chinese companies, with their low labour rates,
can hold prices for the next ten years and still be profitable, and the
difficulties for our industries are immediately identified.''
For that reason, he said, it was essential the new strategy was up and
running to ensure Scotland was able to compete in a market which had
seen enormous changes over the last few years.
It is hoped the plan will lead to a range of initiatives designed to
provide companies with access to ''hands-on'' business development
services, effectively allowing the Scottish industry to compete better.
Dawson International announced on Tuesday it was closing its knitwear
plant at Arbroath in Tayside, with the loss of 221 jobs, and its carpet
yarn plant at Kilwinning, Ayrshire, with the loss of 138 jobs.
Another 53 jobs are to go at Hawick in the Borders, where the
company's brand name Pringle sweaters are produced.
Yesterday, a Scottish Enterprise spokeswoman said: ''From our point of
view, the Dawson announcement is regrettable, and it is all the more
important we have this strategy in place to protect and ensure the
future of the textile industry in Scotland.''
She said talks were already being arranged with the local enterprise
companies as a result of the job losses.
A spokesman for Scottish Enterprise Tayside said it had been in touch
with the company to offer a package of redundancy counselling.
''As a member of the Arbroath Action Group, Scottish Enterprise
Tayside will also be continuing its efforts to address the problems
faced by businesses and unemployed people in Arbroath.''
A spokesman from Scottish Borders Enterprise said it had similar
redundancy counselling machinery, as well as retraining packages.

A LONE fisherman trapped in his overturned boat was kept alive by an
air bubble in his wheelhouse.
Mr John Gannon, of Campbeltown, was recovering in hospital from
hypothermia last night after being rescued off the Mull of Kintyre.
His ordeal began when his 25-ft creel boat, Gille Brighde, began
taking in water. He had time only to broadcast the word Mayday over his
radio six times before the vessel capsized.
Campbeltown lifeboat was launched, along with a Royal Navy rescue
helicopter from Prestwick. The lifeboat crew threw a line over the
vessel and used their powerful engines to lift it a little.
The rescue took just under an hour from the time of the Mayday call.

ANOTHER suspect in the George Beattie case admitted that he ''might''
have been responsible for the murder, say two former detectives.
Mr Bob Beveridge and Mr Ian Muir, former detective constables in the
Scottish Crime Squad, say they came across the man during door-to-door
inquiries into the stabbing of 23-year-old typist Margaret McLaughlin in
Carluke 22 years ago.
''He more or less jumped up from the settee, and without any prompting
he said it might have been him and it might not have been him,'' said Mr
Beveridge, now an antiques dealer in Falkland, Fife.
''He then turned up his jersey and showed me what he claimed to be
stab wounds in his chest and lower abdomen.''
Both detectives were told to arrest the man immediately. They were
ordered to keep him awake throughout the night in a cold, disused police
station near Lanark so that his resistance would be low when
interviewed.
As the men played dominoes and smoked cigarettes, the suspect startled
the two detectives. ''One of the strange things he did say was that his
pastime was going round the neighbourhood stabbing cats . . . quite a
disturbing comment from quite a disturbing guy,'' said Mr Beveridge.
Mr Muir added: ''He later told me that he took great delight in
stabbing cats. Obviously he was quite used to knives. Margaret
McLaughlin had been stabbed using a knife, and I would have thought he
was at least worth interviewing properly.''
However, the two officers were shocked to hear that very morning that
George Beattie had been charged and they were to release their suspect.
The two former detectives now admit that they were disturbed by the
decision and that the man was never formally eliminated from the
inquiry.
Their new evidence will be screened on the BBC's Frontline Scotland
programme tonight.

BRITAIN must stop selling itself short and take pride in its valuable
national assets, the Prince of Wales said yesterday.
Prince Charles, speaking at the Britain in the World Conference,
called on the British to believe in themselves and attacked the
widespread cynicism which he claimed was undermining national life.
''I have sensed over recent years a mood of introspection throughout
the country which has gradually translated into a loss of morale and
increasingly of self-confidence,'' he said.
''I know very well how many people have gone through very difficult
times in recent years, but it is not just that. For it is hardly
surprising that our self-confidence as a nation is at a low ebb when we
are subjected, day after day, to a widespread cynicism about so many
aspects of our national life. There is a persistent current undermining
the integrity and motives of individuals, organisations and
institutions.
''There is every reason for us to have faith and self-confidence in
ourselves and in our country,'' the Prince said.
He claimed that the heartwarming success of the Queen's state visit to
South Africa last week symbolised all that was so special about Britain
and its place in the world.
The conference, the first of its kind, is looking at how Britain's
foreign policy should develop, and the Prince made it clear that he
believes we have an example to set to the world.
''But to do that, we have first to believe in ourselves. Otherwise, as
is increasingly the case, we shall sell ourselves short.''
He warned that, unless we could start to project and invest more
positively in our strengths, we would end up squandering our assets,
with grave consequences for our influence in the world and our own
self-esteem.
He said no discussion of Britain's place in the world could be
complete without careful consideration of the immense skills displayed
by our armed forces, with their proven tradition of excellence and
professionalism recognised the world over.
But he added: ''That tradition has to be nurtured to ensure the
foundations are not weakened by short-term considerations or the
dictates of the latest fashionable theory.

CHILDREN are being sent to adult prisons in Scotland for no other
reason than a shortage of places in secure units for juveniles on
remand, Glasgow lawyer Mr Gerry Brown insisted yesterday.
A 15-year-old schoolboy has just spent one night in Barlinnie,
followed by another at Longriggend remand institution -- before a bed in
the secure unit at Kenmure St Mary's, Bishopbriggs, as recommended at a
children's hearing, became available.
Mr Brown will now raise questions about a lack of suitable provision
for children on remand with Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and
Strathclyde's social work director, Ms Mary Hartnoll.
The lawyer added that two sheriffs who dealt with his young client had
no option but to remand him in custody while he tried in vain for two
days to obtain a room in a secure unit.
Mr Brown said: ''It is wrong in principle that someone under the age
of 16 should be held in a penal institution because secure accommodation
cannot be found.
''If facilities are inadequate, then it is a matter for the funding
authorities to ensure the money is found to provide secure places.''
His comments coincided with allegations that a 14-year-old schoolboy
has been locked up in Porterfield Prison since last Friday because child
care authorities could find nowhere else to send him.
The Inverness jail's reputation is as grim as that of Glasgow's
Barlinnie, with both housing killers and troublemakers, and scene of
bloody riots in the past.
The 14-year-old will appear in court today charged with raping a girl
of the same age in a children's home where they were both residents. He
first appeared in private at Tain Sheriff Court, Easter Ross, last
Friday, making no plea or declaration -- and has been in Porterfield
since.
Highland Regional Council's social work department, which runs the
children's home where the rape is alleged to have taken place, claims to
have telephoned every secure children's unit in Britain searching for a
bed -- rather than see the boy sent to prison on remand.
As soon as a secure unit bed is available, Highland social workers
will ask the court's permission to transfer the boy to ''more
appropriate accommodation.''
A Scottish Prisons Service Department spokesman described the
juvenile's remand to Porterfield as an extremely rare case, and added:
''The court would have its own reasons for remanding him to prison, but
it must have been because of a lack of secure local authority
accommodation in the area.''
Another SPS official said: ''If courts send children aged 14 or over
to us, we take them. There is no question of why.''
The 15-year-old Glasgow boy was transferred yesterday to Kenmure St
Mary's, owned and managed by the Roman Catholic Church and funded by
Strathclyde Regional Council.
He was the subject of a residential order last week from a children's
panel hearing. The panel authorised that he be placed in secure
accommodation at the Bishopbriggs unit -- although it was known that no
spare beds existed.
The boy was arrested on Sunday, spending most of that night in a
police cell. He appeared in private on petition at Glasgow Sheriff Court
on Monday. He was remanded in custody until the following day while his
lawyer tried to find a secure place.
On Tuesday, Mr Brown reported none was available -- and discovered for
the first time that the schoolboy had spent the previous night in
Barlinnie.
The youngster was again remanded, but this time taken to a special,
separate unit for juveniles at Longriggend, near Airdrie, the remand
centre for 16 to 21-year-olds.
A spokesman said it received such young prisoners from courts. It did
not always receive the information that other options for disposal, such
as secure units, had been available to the courts.
At 2pm yesterday, Mr Brown was told a bed had been found at
Bishopbriggs, and the transfer took place. He believes pressure on
social workers led to its availability, and added: ''Until then, the
court's hands had been tied. But a shortage of secure places should not
mean that a child remanded in custody should then go to Barlinnie.
''The boy has been very upset by what has happened. He did not have a
change of clothes at Barlinnie, where he was installed in the hospital
wing, and was also unable to receive visits from his parents.
''It is wrong. There has been a sad increase in the last few months of
children being charged with serious crimes, but someone must make
provision for secure accommodation in their interests, and that of the
public.''
The boy's father said: ''A prison is not suitable for a child. The
resources available to social work are inadequate. Something must be
done.''
His son's charges include a car theft, careless driving, drink
driving, and driving without insurance or a licence. He has made no plea
or declaration.
Strathclyde's social work department confirmed that children's panels
can name secure units in orders even when aware that no places were
available. A spokesman said its two units, with 48 places, are more or
less permanently full, and added: ''If we need to get a place, then
someone has to move out. It is a problem. The matter has been raised
with the Scottish Office.''
He suggested it was up to the Scottish Office to provide the money for
more secure units; Scotland has 84 such beds in all.
A Scottish Office spokesman said a comprehensive review of secure care
has just been carried out, with a report to be submitted to Ministers.
The report looks at several areas, including numbers of places
available, the need to put children into secure accommodation in the
first place, and general improvements in the present system.
He added: ''It is Government policy that children should be kept in
prison only in the most exceptional circumstances, and then for as short
a period as possible. Secure accommodation or other places of safety
chosen by the local authority should normally be used.''
The spokesman confirmed the number of children's referrals to secure
units is rising, but described the occasions when demands put pressure
on available places as rare. He argued recent refurbishments have had an
adverse effect on availability.

THE OWNERS of Glasgow's Sauchiehall Centre have been granted an
interim interdict preventing the Royal Bank of Scotland from closing its
branch in the shopping centre.
A judgment from Lord Penrose issued in the Court of Session in
Edinburgh states that the bank must use and occupy the premises as bank
offices until further order of the court.
It includes details of a letter sent by solicitors of the Royal Bank
of Scotland to Sauchiehall Centre owners Retail Parks Investment
Limited.
The letter, which Lord Penrose referred to as a basis for considering
the issues before him, set out the Royal Bank's plans.
It states that the Royal Bank intended to open a new branch in
Sauchiehall Street on Monday of this week, 500 yards from the
Sauchiehall Centre.
The bank reviewed the extent of its commitment to providing banking
facilities in the city centre and decided that the branch in the
Sauchiehall Centre would close and staff would be transferred.
Two cash machines at the Sauchiehall Centre branch would remain
operational.
The Royal Bank said it accepted that it remains tenant under the lease
until such time as the lease is assigned or terminated. It states that
the bank intended to cease to operate part of their business carried at
the Sauchiehall Centre, but it was not abandoning the subjects.
The Royal Bank has occupied the premises since 1977 and pays #129,000
a year in rent.
Owners and landlords, Retail Parks contended that the Royal Bank would
be in breach of contract if it were to close the branch.
The court papers states: ''Their complaint is the familiar one that
such centres depend for their business efficiency on units being open
and available for ordinary business during normal opening hours. A
'dead' unit is unattractive and affects adversely customer confidence in
the centre. Profitability is likely to suffer and the capital value of
the investment is likely to fall if the defenders carry out their
intention.''
Mr William Nimmo-Smith for the Royal Bank emphasised that it did not
intend to close the facility. Mr Nimmo-Smith said there would continue
to be operational cash machines which would require to be serviced.
He said a fair amount of activity was envisaged and it was not a case
in which a ''black'' hole would be created in the development. He added
that the bank was not walking away from the premises.
The judgment states that what was sought in this case are orders
preserving the status quo while the parties determine the substantial
issues between them.
It states: ''General experience would suggest that the initial impact
of the closure of a significant unit in a shopping development may have
a material impact on confidence and therefore on the prospects of
maintaining the profitability and less directly the value of the
landlord's investment.''
It says that in this case there is a clear positive obligation in the
contract to use and occupy the premises as ''bank offices''.
The inconvenience of operating three branches in relatively close
proximity to each other pending resolution of this dispute does not
appear to be of the same order of importance as the risks to which the
pursuers' (Retail Parks Investments Limited) interests are exposed by
closure.
In granting the interim interdict Lord Penrose said the bank had to
use and occupy the premises as bank offices and to keep them open for
business during normal business hours until further notice of the court.
Mr Colin Wilson, manager of the Sauchiehall Centre, speaking after
hearing the interim interdict was granted said: ''As a landlord, we
asked for a requirement that they must trade for the period of their
lease.
''We took legal steps sufficient to ensure that the bank continued
trading under terms of that lease.
''That action would have been taken against any tenant trying to break
their lease.''
Mr Wilson admitted that the bank was a big name and a focal point of
the centre and it was good for the centre to keep it there.

SCOTLAND'S charities are reeling from the effects of the National
Lottery, with a 16% drop in public contributions reported since its
launch in November.
Elsewhere, a Welsh-based cancer fund has been forced to cut 500 jobs
because of competition from the lottery, with a warning that there is
''worse to come''.
Another national charity says its workers have started a lottery
syndicate because it has more chance of winning #1m than benefiting from
any Government-inspired spin-off.
However, a Government spokesman said they are over-reacting and that
the lottery is providing ''huge benefits''.
Tenovus, based in Cardiff, announced yesterday it was scrapping its
long-running scratch-card game, which has raised millions of pounds for
medical research into breast and prostate cancer.
Shops and supermarkets which sold the cards have been switching to the
National Lottery. Tenovus has closed more than 100 outlets in recent
weeks, and the jobs of its mainly part-time sales staff at kiosks in
larger stores will be lost when the scratch-card game ends.
A spokesman said the lay-offs were a result of the ''devastating
effect'' of the National Lottery.
According to a National Opinion Poll survey to be published tomorrow,
Scotland's charities have suffered more than their English and Welsh
counterparts, with a 16% fall in donations since the lottery launch four
months ago.
The survey of 2000 adults showed that 70% of the Scottish population
gave to charity in the past month, compared to 86% in the corresponding
month in 1994.
However, 66% of Scots believed that buying National Lottery tickets
was ''a good way of helping charity'', further believing that 26p in
every pound goes specifically to charity -- the actual figure is less
than 6p.
Charities have responded to the decline by increasing street
collections.
The NOP poll also predicts that, if the trend continues, charities and
voluntary organisations would make a net loss of #57m over the first
year.
''This survey is the first real evidence that charities are going to
be badly affected by the National Lottery,'' says Mr Martin Sime of the
Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO).
''A big drop in the number of Scots giving to charity will eventually
mean real cuts in services for disadvantaged people.
''But there could be worse to come. The NOP research was carried out
before the National Lottery scratch-card games were introduced.''
Ms Alison MacAskill, Scottish co-ordinator of Meningitis Research,
said participation in its own raffles and draws had dropped by 50% since
the National Lottery launch.
''The lottery has particularly affected our collections outside
supermarkets, because so many of these stores also have lottery
booths,'' she said.
A spokeswoman for Action Research said the effects of the lottery were
''a big concern''.
''We have started a syndicate because we have more chance of getting a
million pounds by winning the National Lottery than by benefiting from
any charitable spin-off from it,'' she added.
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, as an operational charity,
has also been excluded from any lottery spin-off and, although it had
met funding targets, was concerned for the future.
However, two of Scotland's big cancer charities say they have held the
lottery effect at bay, due to established fund-raising events organised
through their local committees.
Mrs Catherine Duffy, regional general manager for the Cancer Relief
McMillan Fund, said she believed that the bulk of people who bought
National Lottery tickets were ''spending their gambling money'' rather
than anything they might give to charity.
A spokeswoman for Marie Curie Cancer Care added that its recent flag
day had been an outstanding success, but the true effects of the lottery
would be measured after it had held its own car lottery in May.
Elswhere, the pools companies have also been hit hard. Turnover at
each of the operators -- Littlewoods, Vernons, and Zetters -- has
plunged by between 10% and 15%.
Two months ago, Vernons cut 95 jobs from a workforce of 600. In
response to pressure from pools firms, the Government is to allow them
to advertise on TV and radio from Saturday.
However, Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell said last night that the
lottery had led to ''huge increases'' in resources.
''Already, in a little over four months, the lottery had raised
roughly #300m for the nominated good causes,'' he added.
* The partner of Mr Lee Ryan, who claimed he had won a #6.5m National
Lottery jackpot, was yesterday named as the winner by organiser Camelot.
Ms Karen Taylor, 35, a mother-of-three, was named following reports that
Mr Ryan, 32 -- who is awaiting trial on a car theft charge -- had
scooped the fortune on March 11.
The couple, who live in Leicester, then added to the confusion by
saying they were joint winners. Camelot dismissed any suggestion of
''dodgy dealing'' and said officials had had no discussions with the
couple about whose name should be on the ticket.

A PENSIONER who has one leg will have to spend an extra week in jail
because social workers could not interview him.
Background reports were called for more than two weeks ago on
71-year-old widower Hugh Burnett, formerly of Aberdeen, when he was was
remanded in custody by Stirling Sheriff Court.
But no one from Central Regional Council's social work department
visited him in Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison to prepare the vital papers
which could have paved the way to his release.
When he reappeared yesterday, a department representative told Sheriff
William Reid that the first social worker who had been allocated the
matter had fallen sick.
The case was then re-allocated to another social worker who also fell
ill.
Three remaining social workers who could have taken the case were all
on a training course.
Begging to be released to go and live with his son in Manchester,
Burnett told Sheriff Reid: ''Every week in Barlinnie is like a month.''
Sheriff Reid said he no option but to continue the remand.
Burnett fell foul of the law after getting into an argument in the
local branch of Littlewoods.
Depute fiscal Valerie Barber-Fleming said he had tried to pay for
goods with a credit card that was not recognised by the store.
He became abusive when a cashier refused to accept the card, and had
to be ejected by a security guard.
Fuming, he dialled 999 from a near-by phone box and told police there
was bomb in the shop. The call was not taken seriously, and there was no
attempt made to evacauate the store, but police did go to the telephone
box and arrested Burnett who was still standing outside.
He admitted causing a breach of the peace, making a bomb theat, and
giving a false name when he was picked up.

A POLICEMAN has been cleared of kicking and slapping a 12-year-old
boy.
Constable John Dryden, 33, was off-duty when he grabbed the youngster
who had thrown something at his car. He was charged with slapping and
kicking the boy but at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday he was found
not guilty of the charge.
Mr Dryden had denied the alleged assault said to have taken place at a
subway at Milton Road and Sir Harry Lauder Road in Portobello, last July
25.
His trial heard that he was driving along when a youth standing by the
road threw something which hit and damaged his car.
He stopped, got out and ran down an embankment before grabbing the
youth. He then pulled him back up some steps to show him what he had
done to the car and that it was wrong.
Sheriff Kenneth Forbes ruled out the claims of kicking and slapping
because he did not believe the boy and decided that PC Dryden's actions
in grabbing and pulling him up the steps did not amount to assault.
Defending solicitor Douglas Main said PC Dryden had acted properly and
had done what would have been expected of a police officer.

THE Government was on the defensive again last night on the ''sleaze''
factor as Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken issued a second statement
fiercely denying he was aware of arms deals to Iran when he was a
non-executive director of the firm involved.
The Prime Minister is convinced that Mr Aitken, now his Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, was not party to a #15m deal to provide naval
gunnery to Iran in the 1980s, contrary to British Government guidelines
forbidding such trade.
Mr Aitken, a former Defence Procurement Minister, is under growing
pressure to make a full statement about his #10,000-a-year role at
Grantham-based British Manufacturer and Research Company, BMARC, during
the 1980s.
The firm appears to have been providing weapons to Iran via Singapore,
in a deal known as Project Lisi, but its former directors claim they did
not break any Government sanctions during the Iraq/Iran war.
Shadow Trade Secretary Jack Cunningham sent a letter to Mr Major
yesterday stating there are ''manifest inconsistencies'' in statements
made by Mr Aitken and Mr Gerald James, chairman of BMARC at the time.
Labour regards this as another opportunity to embarrass Mr Aitken
following last year's muddles over his hotel bill at the Ritz in Paris,
owned by Mr Mohamed Al-Fayed, who also owns Harrods.
It was bolstered in its effort yesterday by Mr John Anderson, of
Inverness, another director of parent company Astra at the time. He
supported what Mr James said about BMARC board meetings.
Mr Anderson told The Herald last night at his home: ''The papers for
the board meetings were always sent to everyone at least five days in
advance and Project Lisi was listed. If you turn round and say it wasn't
discussed, well I know that it was; if you turn round and say I didn't
understand it, well you are getting paid #10,000 a year for nothing.''
He went on: ''I was astonished when Mr Aitken said he didn't know
anything. Everything is discussed at the board meetings. Project Lisi
would be discussed. He must have known.
''The goods were going to Singapore. We had an export licence for
Singapore showing cannon. They go to Singapore and get put back together
again. Then Singapore grants them a licence for where they were going
to.
''We would never see the Singapore export licence, but put it this
way, the British Government granted an export licence for say 50 to 60
cannon for Singapore. Now Singapore wouldn't use that, there would never
be a requirement for that . . . . So it was granted knowing full well it
was going on to a third country.
''I just repeat Mr Aitken came to us, he was paid #10,000 a year, he
came to nine or 10 board meetings. He wanted on the main board of Astra
but the chairman came to us and we said put him on the board of Grantham
to see if he is any good.''
Mr Anderson told Channel 4 News he asked for the regular board meeting
time to be moved from 10am to 9am to fit in with his London train.
Papers which could prove whether Mr Aitken attended the board meetings
in question have been withheld by Whitehall for years, it was alleged
last night. The Guardian reported that company papers were seized by
Ministry of Defence police in 1990 during an inquiry, and Mr James has
since been fighting for their return. They were handed over to the
official receivers when the firm went into liquidation in 1993, it said,
with some returned to Mr James this week.
Mr Aitken, following a story in the Independent, issued a statement
declaring he was not briefed on the alleged Iran arms deal, and was
absent from a board meeting when the issue was discussed.
However, Mr James, on BBC Radio, said Mr Aitken's ignorance was
incredible.
Later Mr Aitken issued another statement rebutting Mr James's claim,
insisting that he has his facts wrong.
''First, he claims that I knew that the so-called Lisi contract
involved the export of arms to Iran. I did not know that and three other
directors at that time confirmed that I am right.
''Secondly, he claims that the Lisi contract was discussed at board
meetings that I attended. This is not my recollection nor is it that of
three other directors of BMARC. Thirdly, he claims that the contract was
worth #60m. I have since been informed that it was worth a quarter of
that, of which only about #3m remained by the time I joined the board
two years after the contract had been signed.''
Mr Aitken states that the board meeting where the contract was
allegedly discussed was the first he attended as a non-executive
director. ''I am not aware of, and have never been involved in, any
wrongdoing in relation to this or any other contract.''
Mr Aitken's denials were backed by General Donald Isles, another
director, who was in charge of Project Lisi at the time BMARC was taken
over by Astra. General Isles said: ''I would say, in fact I am sure,
that Jonathan Aitken would just know Project Lisi, if he could remember
it at all, as a project which delivered weapons to Singapore.''
Lisi stood for licensed to Singapore, he told BBC Radio 4's The World
Tonight, and as Singapore was a Commonwealth country, there was no need
for an end user's certificate.
It was ''absolute rubbish'' for Mr James to say it was common
knowledge the arms were destined for Iran, he said.
It is alleged by the Independent that the Iran deal was struck by
BMARC's former parent company Oerlikon. The newspaper claims that
accountants Stoy Hayward warned the Astra Group when it bought the firm
it could run into arms regulations problems.
In the Commons, Labour demanded a personal statement from Mr Aitken.
This was resisted.
Mr Aitken has sent all the correspondence on the matter of BMARC to
Lord Scott for his inquiry into arms to Iraq.
The Lisi deal appears to have involved shipping the weapons in kit
form to Singapore where they were assembled and sent on to Iran. More
components are said to have been added in Singapore by a firm using
equipment supplied free by BMARC. Mr Aitken claims he had no knowledge
of this deal and that he left a board meeting early at which it was
discussed.
''If I had been told BMARC was exporting naval guns to Iran via
Singapore in violation of the Howe (the then Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe) guidelines, I would certainly not have countenanced such
exports.''
Mr James, on the BBC's World at One, said: ''I think that is rubbish
because his name is on the Minutes. It was in the third item that it was
discussed, which was 'Matters Arising', and he was clearly there. He was
there for four hours.''
He went on: ''The official destination for the supply of the naval
guns was Singapore, but it was quite clearly going to Iran. It was
common knowledge it was going to Iran.''
This intervention forced Mr Aitken into his later statement.
Last night the Prime Minister was standing by him. Number 10 would
take the matter no further in the belief that Mr Aitken has fully
explained the position.
Labour leader Tony Blair is expected to tackle Mr Major today on the
issue at Prime Minister's question time.
The Labour attack was opened by Shadow Trade and Industry Minister
Brian Wilson: ''His defence of ignorance simply is not credible. We are
asked to believe that Mr Aitken, as an active director, was unaware of
an order worth #15m, and did not take the trouble to find out what trade
was being conducted with Iran.''

GLASGOW District Council yesterday poured scorn on the accusation that
it was responsible for a council house repair scandal and released a
report which shows it will spend an extra #475,000 on tackling repairs
next year.
The accusation had been levelled by Scottish Militant Labour
councillors who claimed there was a massive repairs crisis in the city
with the Labour administration guilty of covering up the true level of
the repairs backlog.
According to Militant Councillor Tommy Sheridan at least one in three
families living in council houses were waiting for repairs with, 57,000
repair lines (reported faults) outstanding on the council's stock of
129,000 houses.
However, Councillor Madge O'Neill, convener of public sector housing,
told a news conference yesterday that Mr Sheridan was manipulating the
figures -- which she herself had given him -- for his own political
ends.
She said: ''Rather than a repair scandal we now have a better
performance record than we have had for some years and this is partly
due to the establishment of local repair teams which can respond much
more quickly.''
In 1994/95 the repairs budget was #41.1m which represented an increase
for the previous year in real terms of #282,640 despite stock loss of
5691 houses.
The 1995/96 revenue budget will see an increase in real terms from the
previous year of #475,189 despite a loss of 4628 houses. On average the
council dealt with 6788 repairs a week.
Councillor O'Neill added: ''The situation with repairs is that it is
better now than it has ever been. We are tackling the problem
properly.''
Councillor O'Neill was backed by Mr David Comley, city housing
director, who said that at any given time there would be repairs
outstanding. ''In the figures there is nothing that won't get done.''
The council also maintained that some repair lines would be duplicates,
with some houses requiring several repairs.
Councillor O'Neill also dismissed Mr Sheridan's call for #3m to be
taken out of the council's #6m reserves and spent on repairs.
The report also shows that in 1994/95 the repairs budget was
complemented by nearly #19m of capital money to fit 42,400 new windows
and 1340 central heating systems in accordance with the Glasgow Action
For Warm Homes strategy.
In Glasgow there are 120,000 council houses currently under the
management of the housing department. That stock has been steadily
decreasing over the past 10 years through demolition, sell-offs to
sitting tenants, and hive-offs to local housing associations and tenant
management groups.

* Labour councillors yesterday approved a plan to cut 68 jobs within
the housing department.
It will mean an annual saving of #1.3m to the council -- an average of
more than #19,000 for each job lost.
The staff cuts are the first phase of an internal restructuring as the
department faces the change-over to Government-imposed competitive
tendering.
The department presently has a payroll of 1550 white-collar officials
and about 800 manual workers. Details of the staff run-down have been
thrashed out with unions -- there will be no compuslory redundancies.
The restructuring is aimed at producing a streamlined and more cost
effective management chain, the council said.
