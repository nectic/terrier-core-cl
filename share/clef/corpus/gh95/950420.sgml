FEARS were growing last night that the entire flotation of General
Cable may be in doubt after it was forced to slash its flotation price
by nearly 30% to 190p.
Whether or not the flotation goes ahead will depend on whether US
institutions agree to the new lower price.
The original price range was 220p to 225p but merchant bankers
Lazards, which is handling the issue, wanted to avoid a situation where
the price was set and the stock fell to a discount in its early days of
trading.
The flotation price was cut in response to the depressed condition of
the UK stock market since last month when the company announced its
intention to float and a softer outlook for the cable television sector.
At the planned 220p to 225p price level, General Cable, a subsidiary
of Generale Des Eaux, would have had a value between #557m and #646m.
After the flotation Generale will hold about 56% of General Cable's
equity.
General Cable is the sixth-largest cable operator in the UK measured
by franchise ownership with around 916,000 equity homes in a number of
regions around the country, including Yorkshire and Humberside. It has
enjoyed above-average penetration rates for its television, residential
and businesss telephony service although its revenue per television
subscriber is the lowest in the sector.
The General Cable offering is for 90 million shares equivalent to
about 35% of the expanded share capital.
The weak market conditions have already taken their toll on the cable
sector with Videotron floating last month at a price below its original
range.
TeleWest Communications, which provides cable services to a large part
of Scotland, went public last November at 182p but has since fallen
sharply trading yesterday at 153[1/2]p, down 7p.
Nynex CableComms is also due to float in the near future.
There are always teething problems with any new industry seeking to
establish itself in the marketplace and cable is no exception. Its
obvious competitive telephony service has enabled it to make greater
inroads into BT's monopoly than had originally been expected.
However, cable television does not as yet provide an attractive enough
service to attract subscribers in their droves. There is currently too
much imported American and Australian material although UK-based
programming is increasing in quantity.
The fall-off in the rate of growth of cable television subscription in
the past few months is only to be expected, say many industry insiders,
given the relative youth of the market in the UK.
A similar pause in growth was witnessed during the development of the
US cable industry. However, cable television faces the prospect of
long-term competition from digital terrestrial television which could
see increased rates of subscriber cancellations, known as churn, in the
later years of the decade as these new services come on stream.
Although it is early days yet for the UK cable industry investors are
right to be cautious in their investment in the sector given the
likelihood of regular debt/equity funding exercises.
In addition, there is expected to be considerable merger and
acquisition activity in the sector in the medium term as operators seek
contiguous franchises in order to achieve widespread economies of scale.

SHINTY'S long-term difficulties finding decent balls to play with
could be at an end. Exhaustive tests and painstaking research by the
Camanachd Association's equipment convener, Allan Hill, have led to the
production of a new ball, coated in synthetic leather. The balls are now
on sale, having been piloted successfully in a series of matches,
including the Glenmorangie Sutherland Cup final.
Association secretary Alister MacIntyre has hailed their arrival as a
major plus for the game. He said: ''Allan Hill deserves great credit for
the way he has persevered with this project, cutting up old balls,
soaking them in tins, analysing the results, and then drawing up the new
plan. We are now confident that the new ball, which conforms with the
rules and regulations in every respect, will give clubs and players the
quality product they have been missing for some years now. The balls are
also cheaper than others on the market, so given that they should last
longer as well, that is an added bonus.''
Meanwhile, the race for places in the national league next season will
be keen this Saturday with two crucial fixtures which could go a long
way to resolving the matter.
In the north, Lovat's meeting with Glenurquhart at Kiltarlity is vital
for both sides, and also for Skye, who will be watching with interest.
Skye, Lovat, and the Glen are all contesting the fourth place in the
north with all three, before Saturday's match, having a theoretical
maximum of 14 points. That would be enough to win a league place, but
only one of the trio can qualify.
Both Lovat and the Glen have one more match after this one, and Skye
have one more, against Fort William. The island side currently have 12
points, Lovat and Glenurquhart both 10. The bottom line appears to be
that 14 points will guarantee a place in the new league. Therefore, if
either Lovat or Glenurquhart can win on Saturday, they will eliminate
Skye and render the rest of the increasingly complicated arithmetic
meaningless.
In the south, Glenorchy, Inveraray, Oban Celtic, and Glasgow Mid
Argyll are battling for three places.
Kyles' non-participation in the new set-up and Oban Camanachd's status
as champions leaves the other fighting for just three places.
Oban Celtic's match with Mid Argyll on Saturday is therefore vital to
both their chances. The south cut-off point appears to be 16 points, and
Celtic can achieve that by beating Glasgow on Saturday.

AN SNP complaint about a letter in which Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
said that Mr Michael Forsyth, MP for Stirling and a Home Office
Minister, would represent the interests of Perth and Kinross
constituents until the by-election was upheld by the Speaker in the
Commons yesterday.
Miss Betty Boothroyd agreed with the contention by SNP leader Mr Alex
Salmond that no-one but an elected Member could represent a constituency
in Parliament.
Mr Salmond said: ''Given that it is now two months since the vacancy,
wouldn't it be a better idea if the Government moved the writ for the
by-election and let the people of Perth and Kinross choose who is to be
their MP, as opposed to attempting to foist Mr Forsyth on an unwilling
population?''
The phrase which brought the protest is contained in a two-page letter
written by Mr Lang to voters in the constituency asking them to respond
to a questionnaire about the issues which concern them and also setting
out Conservative policies. A faxed copy came into the hands of the SNP.
Mr Salmond said later that Mr Lang was misleading people with talk of
appointing Mr Forsyth to look after the constituency.
He added: ''The Tories are talking about perhaps waiting another two
months before the by-election will be held. The Tories can run from the
voters of Perth and Kinross but they cannot hide.''

A MARATHON runner almost died the night a masked man left him with
horrific knife wounds.
Mr Roderick Girvan, 43, a building worker, was rushed by air ambulance
from Campbeltown to Glasgow, where only emergency surgery and his superb
fitness saved his life.
But yesterday, the savage attack which shocked the fishing town still
remained a mystery.
A jury at the High Court in Glasgow took only 50 minutes to clear
share fisherman Mr Martin Morrison, 30, of the assault which left the
victim near to death.
Mr Morrison, of Park Square, Campbeltown, was found not guilty by a
majority verdict of attempting to murder Mr Girvan outside his home in
the town's Witchburn Road on November 5 last year.
In a special defence he blamed two other local men and also pleaded
alibi.
Mr Girvan described how a masked man attacked him and stabbed him
repeatedly but he managed to stagger across the road to a neighbour's
for help.
He was given blood transfusions and morphine before being flown to
Glasgow, where surgeons performed an emergency operation.
Two local men, Mr Archie Deans, 28, and Mr Dennis O'Brien, 27, who
were incriminated by Mr Morrison, claimed the accused came to their
flat.
They alleged he borrowed a change of clothing, including a Balaclava
helmet with eye slits, and a carving knife and returned later and
changed back into his own clothes.
Both claimed the accused told them to throw the borrowed clothes on to
a Guy Fawkes bonfire. They denied being involved in the assault.

THOUSANDS of computer users around the world have been switched on by
a pure dead brilliant new program.
The rather impersonal Dalek-like voice of the personal computer has
been replaced with pure Glasgow patter.
To date, more than 16,000 computer buffs have made copies of the
accented announcements in the two weeks since their release. The program
is a big success in the States, where ''A'right, pal?'' replaces ''Have
a nice day.''
The free program was designed to help new users navigate their way
through systems linked to the Internet, and features such advice as
''Yer noo enterin' a forum'' and ''Ye've new mail waitin'.''
Mr Neil Laver, of CompuServe, who came up with the program, said:
''Its success has amazed us. We never expected so many people to go for
the Glaswegian twang.
''We made a variety of language programs in English, Welsh, and west
coast Scottish. The English language programme was most popular but the
Glaswegian was nearly as popular. People from all over the world have
taken to the accent. We are delighted.''
Users with CompuServe accounts can copy the program by typing ''go
UKFORUM'' and clicking on ''Scotland''.

WHEN Gerard Eadie is not running CR Smith, the Scottish window
replacement and conservatory company he founded, you'll find him out in
spectacular Scottish scenery taking part in one of his newest business
interests.
Lands of Finderlie is a corporate hospitality company which offers
businesses and individual groups a day's falconry with what is believed
to be the largest collection of hunting birds in Europe.
Set up by Mr Eadie and developed from his personal interest and
passion for those birds of prey, the new company employs four
professional falconers and dog trainers who look after corporate groups
giving guests the warmest of hospitality.
Mr Eadie said: ''It's a unique experience watching a Harris hawk
turning and twisting through the forest in pursuit of its prey. The
spectacular high-speed 'stoop' over 100mph of a trained Peregrine falcon
is something you'll never forget as it dives towards its target.''
Having been greeted by an impressive collection of birds at venues
such as Stakis Dunkeld House Hotel, participants quickly find themselves
literally with a bird in the hand, holding birds on a gloved hand as
they climb some of Scotland's gentlest but most stunning hills.
They are given instruction from the head falconer, Adrian Hallgarth,
who also demonstrates the variety of hawks and explains how this ancient
sport dates back some 4000 years to Egyptian kings.
According to Mr Eadie: ''Falconry is a totally different experience
and one that moves on from golf, fishing, shooting and other more
predictable ways of entertaining guests, although we appreciate the
popularity of these established sports and often combine elements of
them into our days out.''

HOTELS and casinos group Stakis would perhaps have surprised the
market more by releasing its second-quarter trading statement without
news of yet another acquisition.
However, true to recent form, the revamped and acquisitive
Glasgow-based company announced the #6.13m cash purchase of a
104-bedroom hotel in the Midlands shortly after yesterday morning's
generally healthy report on business.
Stakis remains on the lookout for a major acquisition, such as a chain
of hotels. Only the absence of the correct opportunity has prevented
such a move materialising.
Chief executive David Michels said yesterday: ''At the moment it is
carefully, slowly, one at a time, at reasonable prices. We are
continually looking for an acquisition that will make a bigger
difference.
''We would certainly love it if the right opportunity arose.''
The only setback in trading in the 13 weeks to April 2 was a fall in
attendances at the group's 23-strong casino chain, in spite of two
additions in Bournemouth during the quarter.
However, although numbers at the gaming tables were down 12% on the
second quarter of the previous financial year at 473,000, the spend per
head increased from #120 to #135. The cash drop was therefore only
marginally lower at #64m. For the first half as a whole, it was up 4% at
#132.4m.
On the hotels side, the second-quarter room occupancy rate was 63.1%,
an improvement on the 62.1% recorded during the same three months of
last year.
Stakis also managed to push the average room rate up from #40.74 to
#42.84. For the first six months as a whole, the occupancy rate was 3%
higher at 66.4%. The average room rate was #42.99, up from #41.64.
Improved occupancy was achieved in spite of the closure for most of
the quarter of the Stakis Four Seasons at Aviemore, because of fire
damage, and of the Stakis Nottingham, to allow refurbishment work.
The Westpoint Hotel, at East Kilbride, was acquired by Stakis in
February. The group also purchased the Moorside Hotel, in Cheshire, last
month.
In the year to October 2, Stakis more than doubled pre-tax profits to
#20.2m.
Stockbroker Tilney is forecasting a 33% rise in profits this year to
#26.9m, on turnover of #165m.
Stakis, whose current tax charge is relatively low because of prior
year losses, is likely to be hit with a higher bill in two years.
However, Tilney considers this will be more than offset by growth in
earnings and also believes that Stakis, unlike major competitors such as
Bass and Ladbrokes, will be relatively untouched by Accounting Standards
Board requirements relating to the depreciation of property.
In a falling market, Stakis shares lost 2p to 85p.
The group's latest purchase, the Carlton Manor Hotel in Corby, already
has a room occupancy rate of 65%, so effectively Stakis is buying a
return rather than just a physical asset.
Built in 1991 in Georgian style, Stakis's fortieth hotel comes with
3.5 acres of ground adjacent to it. The existing 70 staff will be
offered employment with Stakis.
The three-storey hotel, which will be renamed the Stakis Corby, has
conference facilities for up to 400, a leisure club and two restaurants.
Mr Michels, who put the drop in casino attendances down to the
introduction of membership and guest fees, said: ''Our quarterly trading
figures were acceptable. For the moment, what we are doing seems to be
paying off.''

NEW ownership and a clear business and marketing plan have set a
Perthshire model making company back on its feet.
From sinking into receivership Wildtrak, based in Auchterarder,
expects to turn over #500,000 in the next 18 months.
More staff have been taken on since the present partners bought the
business a year ago, and the outlook for both UK and overseas markets is
healthy.
Wildtrak was established four years ago to produce top-quality,
hand-painted animal sculptures, varying in size from small, mantelpiece
figures to much larger ones.
But the recession and previous management failings took their toll and
the company floundered.
Just three production staff were employed, doing everything from
painting the models to packing them when 25-year-old Duncan McIntosh and
two other partners took over.
''There was no-one out on the road, and the company hadn't attended a
trade show for a while, and that's where a lot of the selling is done in
this business,'' said McIntosh.
''We have tried to inject some fresh ideas and a bit of energy into
something that hadn't really had that for a while.''
Buying into Wildtrak has taken McIntosh, who trained in agriculture,
in a completely new direction. But it's a challenge the young man
clearly relishes.
Capital came from the investor's own cash, bank loans and advice was
on hand from the local enterprise company.
''We were very conscious of not biting off more than we could chew
when we started, but we are now in a position to go forward,'' said
McIntosh.
While the animal sculptures continue to be the company's main stay,
Wildtrak aims to diversify the product range for greater security.
Currently in production is a range of ''twentieth century icons'' as
sculptor Chris Rattray calls them.
His idea took shape with a model of Michael Jackson, presented to the
singer in Tenerife two years ago during his ''Dangerous'' tour. Two
identical models went to actresses Liz Taylor and Brook Shields.
Other music greats in the series, expected to go on sale later this
year, are John Lennon, Jimmy Hendrix, and Jim Morrison of The Doors.
Duncan McIntosh is quick to emphasise that Wildtrak is not a

SCOTLAND'S showpiece jumps meeting of the year comes under orders at
Ayr today, when both champion jockey Richard Dunwoody and Norman
Williamson, the Cheltenham Gold Cup hero, will be riding.
Although Jenny Pitman will not decide until today whether to attempt a
double with Aintree winner Royal Athlete in the Stakis Scottish Grand
National on Saturday, he has been installed as 7-1 favourite with most
of the leading bookmaking firms.
Tartan Tyrant, owned by Langholm businessman David Stevenson, is joint
second favourite with Sweet Duke and Arthur's Minstrel.
Only 29 of the original 80 entries stood their ground at the five-day
stage and so the three Scottish-trained hopes, Plenty Crack, Off The
Bru, and Ceilidh Boy, will get a run.
Stompin is to miss the Daily Star Scottish Champion Hurdle on
Saturday. Instead, Henrietta Knight will send the four-year-old bay to
Punchestown for the Murphys Irish Stout Champion Hurdle on April 27.

HOLDERS AC Milan and former champions Ajax will contest this year's
European Cup final after both sides recorded comprehensive victories in
their semi-final second legs.
Dejan Savicevic struck twice to give Milan a 2-0 win over Paris St
Germain and take the holders to the final 3-0 on aggregate.
Leading 1-0 after the first leg in Paris two weeks ago, Milan were
virtually home and dry when Savicevic tricked his way past his marker,
Ricardo, to slot the ball home after 21 minutes.
Savicevic raced on to a Marcel Desailly pass after 67 minutes to
complete a win that takes Milan to their third successive final in the
competition.
Milan were beaten 1-0 by Marseille in the 1993 final but last year
thrashed Barcelona 4-0 to take the Cup for the fifth time. Victory in
the final in Vienna on May 24 would allow Milan to equal Real Madrid's
record of six European Cup triumphs.
Meanwhile, a rampant Ajax Amsterdam routed Bayern Munich 5-2 to reach
their first European Cup final for 22 years.
In an exhilarating display of fast, attacking football, Ajax outpaced,
out-thought, and outclassed their opponents. It took only 10 minutes for
the breakthrough, when Finnish internationalist Jari Litmanen nodded in
from close range after Ronald de Boer had headed on a corner.
The German side equalised after 36 minutes through a header from
Marcel Witeczek, but the Amsterdam club regained the lead within four
minutes, Marc Overmars setting up Finidi George to smash the ball home
from 20 yards. Two minutes before the break de Boer made it 3-1.
Shortly after half-time Bayern were as good as out when Litmanen
scored his second goal of the game and sixth of the competition.
Scholl converted a penalty after 76 minutes to make it 4-2 but
Overmars wrapped up the match two minutes from time to make it 5-2.

Hibernian 0, Falkirk 2
FALKIRK survived an amazing barrage by Hibs at Easter Road yesterday
and, at the end, found themselves still looking towards a European place
next season.
This was the fourth meeting between the clubs this season and Hibs,
rivals for a UEFA Cup berth, have failed to win against the Brockville
men.
But it remains a mystery how they failed to do so yesterday when they
dropped three points to lag four behind them in the premier division
table.
Afterwards, their manager, Alex Miller admitted: ''It's going to be an
uphill struggle now for the European place but it's not over yet,
although there's no denying that we have made things difficult for
ourselves.
''We played well today, the best we have played for weeks and
controlled the game for 95% of the time but we just could not get the
ball into the net.''
Falkirk, with far fewer opportunities, found that task much easier. In
15 minutes they showed Hibs how it should be done after Willie Miller
had fouled Paul McGrillen just outside the penalty area.
John Clark placed the ball then crashed in a shot which beat Jim
Leighton and struck the underside of the bar as it flew into the net.
''That was a special goal,'' enthused Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies.
''Some people may blame the keeper but the ball dipped viciously. John
can do that -- he can move the ball, bend it, swerve it, and make it dip
-- it paid off today.
''We have an outstanding chance of going into Europe now with two of
our last three games at Brockville.
''We did not deserve to win this one but sometimes you get the breaks
and that happened today.''
The breaks that Jefferies referred to were scattered through the match
-- and even into injury time for it was then that they scored their
second goal.
A long ball played forward by Steve Fulton dropped at the edge of the
box and neither Graham Mitchell nor Leighton could decide who should go
for it. Colin McDonald moved between them and sent a lob over the keeper
and into goal.
But it should have been so different for Hibs as Falkirk were forced
to make changes to their team through first-half injuries. McGrillen
went off in 17 minutes, with McDonald coming on and Joe McLaughlin
limped off three minutes before half-time, Fulton taking over.
While all of this was happening Hibs were wasting chances that their
territorial advantage continually offered them.
Darren Jackson sent a free-kick high over the bar, Keith Wright had a
shot pushed away by Tony Parks then a minute later the keeper stopped
another try from the same player.
After the break, it was the same story except the misses were more
glaring.
A pass from Miller found Jackson in the clear in front of goal after
75 minutres but somehow he shot well wide of the target.
A minute later Pat McGinlay sent in a header from inside the six-yard
box which Parks collected easily.
And before the end Jackson headed a ball well away from goal when it
seemed easier for him to score.
There were five bookings in the match. Hibs' Pat McGinlay was shown
the yellow card in 62 minutes and Falkirk had four men cautioned,
starting with Steve Kirk in eight minutes, with Joe McLaughlin, Scott
McKenzie, and John Hughes joining him before the end.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, Miller, Mitchell, McGinlay, Tweed, Millen,
McAllister, Farrell, Wright, Jackson, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Evans,
Tortolano, Reid.
FALKIRK -- Parks, Weir, McGowan, Hughes, McLaughlin, Clark, Kirk,
Rice, McGrillen, Johnston, McKenzie. Substitutes -- Fulton, McDonald,
Lamont.
Referee -- R Tait (East Kilbride).

SCOTLAND may have to do without one of their most experienced
internationalists, Paul McStay, for their European Championship
qualifying game with San Marino next week, writes Ian Paul. The Celtic
midfield man, who has been capped 72 times, is suffering from an ankle
injury and was unable to play in his side's 1-0 defeat by Hearts last
night.
''He looks very doubtful for Scotland,'' said manager Tommy Burns
after the game. The international rules do not permit Celtic to withdraw
the player and he will have to be examined by the Scotland medical staff
before manager Craig Brown can make a decision about a replacement.
Brown watched the match at Hampden and will have talks with Burns
today before he assesses the position, but it will be a setback to his
plans, because he had already said that McStay, who has been in good
form recently, would be a key player next week.
Brown did have the consolation of seeing McStay's Scotland team-mate,
John Collins, put in a fine performance.

CITY of Glasgow pair Fraser Walker and Alison Sheppard face this
season's crucial test in the European Championship trials at Sheffield
over the next four days.
Eyebrows have been raised at the timing of the trials, almost four
months before the European event is staged in Vienna, and failure to
make the British team will virtually end the season before it has
started for the leading names. Only the winners are guaranteed
selection.
Sheppard, the two-time Olympian, and Walker, the Commonwealth Games
bronze medallist, both face their big challenge tomorrow in the 50m
freestyle and 200m medley respectively. Today, the Stockport-based Scot
Graeme Smith takes on English rival Ian Wilson in the 1500m freestyle.
Smith, the only Scot to compete in last year's world championships,
has done his own thing this season, preferring to work with Stockport
coach Dave Caleja rather than following the Scottish programme which
included a two-week training camp in Lanzarote.
The 19-year-old's approach has already reaped rewards with a string of
Scottish records, and at least he has the option of competing in the
World Student Games in Japan in August, should he miss out on the
European side.
The event also marks a first domestic appearance for Edinburgh's Paul
Latimer since he returned from an initial year at the University of
Texas.
Latimer, formerly with Warrender, has been training alongside Smith at
Stockport since his return from the States, and lines-up with Walker in
the 200m medley. The pair are also in the 400m medley on Sunday.

THE 20-strong Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup squad enjoyed a
morale-boosting 16[1/2]-13[1/2] victory over a West Region PGA team at
Royal Porthcawl, in Wales, yesterday at the end of the second squad
training session as they prepare to meet America in September.
Leading the Scottish contingent was Cochrane Castle's veteran
campaigner Barclay Howard, who is bidding for his first Walker Cup cap.
The 42-year-old was the only Scot to record a foursomes win in the
morning and add a singles victory in the afternoon.
Partnered by former British Amateur champion Gary Wolstenholme, the
pair trounced John Peters and Marcus Wills by 5 and 4 with Howard
disposing of former European Tour professional Wills by 3 and 2.
Ladybank's David Downie, Bathgate's Stephen Gallacher, and Hugh
McKibbin, of Troon Welbeck, all failed to build on morning foursomes
wins, which the amateurs emphatically won 9-1.
Gallacher was pushed to the final hole only to be pipped by former
Walker Cup player Matt Stanford. Scottish Amateur champion McKibbin was
beaten by fellow Scot Graham Laing, now a professional at North Wilts.
* CRAIG Ronald, the European Tour rookie, partly made up for a missed
cut in last week's Catalonia Open by winning the West of Scotland
Alliance championship for the first time yesterday.
The East Kilbride assistant shot a two-over-par 73 over a Windyhill
course that lived up to its name and then a one-under-par 67 over
Clydebank &amp; District to claim the McCondichie Quaich by two shots from
Buchanan Castle amateur Finlay Jardine. Leading scores (Windyhill

SAMPDORIA v ARSENAL
STRIKER supreme Ian Wright stands to become the goal king of Europe if
he completes a magnificent run of scoring in eight consecutive Cup
Winners' Cup matches for holders Arsenal against Sampdoria.
But, although Sampdoria's England captain David Platt believes
hot-shot Wright is capable of achieving this magnificent record, he has
also told the Gunners to forget any notions of making another piece of
history -- as the only side ever to defend the trophy.
''I believe we are going to knock them out,'' said Platt on the eve of
the second leg of the semi-final at the Luigi Ferraris Stadium, where
Arsenal start with only a slender 3-2 lead.
''Arsenal will have to score to survive because I'm convinced we will
get at least the one goal we need,'' said Platt, who again has to miss
out through suspension after a sending off against Porto.
''We've got to be concerned about Ian Wright because scoring in every
tie so far is a phenomenal record. But this time one goal is unlikely to
be enough. We got two at Highbury and are geared to score more at
home.''
Arsenal caretaker-manager Stewart Houston admitted: ''We know we are
going to have to defend for long spells against a very talented and
flexible side like Sampdoria, but our record shows we have the players
capable of doing it.
''I believe there are a few weaknesses for us to exploit in the
Sampdoria defence.''

PROCESS (TEN28) is a Glasgow-based partnership of artists Ken Davidson
and Tam Dean Burn. At the world's largest performance art festival in
Cleveland, Ohio, they performed -- with eight-year-old Skye MacDade-Burn
-- a new work: Lake Erie. Davidson kept a diary:
Wednesday April 12
THE telephone number I have for the festival always has the answer
machine on. The newspapers say that Black Market International, the
headline artists, will not perform.
Thursday April 13
THERE is still no reply from the festival. We go to the Colonian
Arcade Ballroom where it is supposed to be. Nobody is going to be at the
venue until after five.
Six o'clock. People have appeared. I want the backstage area. It is
full of dust and piping, a huge fan heater. It looks completely
derelict. Nobody has used this for performance in the festival. I like
it.
I watch the evening's programme, missing Zbigniew Warpechowski who is
setting up the Museum of Performance Art in Poland. He is a founder
member of Black Market International.
The Americans seem strange, open, very self-conscious. Eric Myers
throws worms at the audience after his piece.
Good Friday
TAM goes with Skye to the funfair in a hangar out by the airport. We
buy a costume for Skye in a thrift shop. I miss Zbigniew again. Irina
Danilova, a Moscow artist now living in New York, performs. She believes
59 is the fundamental number in the world. She speaks 118 words. She
sounds like a KGB agent. Her piece is about climbing a skyscraper in New
York. The skyscraper has 59 floors. She has a video of herself climbing
the steps. Eric Myers throws worms again.
Saturday April 15
TODAY, we perform. I meet Robert who is going to be the sound
engineer. He will manipulate feedback from a microphone in the space.
Tam is motionless throughout the performance -- dead or unconscious.
He starts hidden in a cupboard behind pieces of plasterboard and planks.
Skye will reveal him and drag him to the centre of the room. I fix the
microphone and make final dresses to the installation. Tam and Skye go
through the script then watch the Chicago and East German mixed media
company, Alien Nation. I have missed Zbigniew again. Skye falls asleep
during Alien Nation. We perform at 11. The piece works. I am too busy to
see it all.
Easter Sunday
THE last day of the festival: nobody is sure whether Black Market
International is now performing or not.
I see Zbigniew. His performance consists of him walking around the
room blowing gently behind each person's ear. Performance art is now
nearly 80 years old. Zbigniew says that this is where the real art is
being made today.
Lauren Petty closes the festival. She is from Santa Fe, originally New
York. Her ballet positions become goosesteps and Nazi salutes until her
breasts fall out from her tutu. She cannot hide her breasts with her
hands. She tells us that she apologises from them being seen so in
public. So closes the 8th Annual Cleveland Performance Art Festival.
In the ballroom Thea, who has been hanging around all week, has filled
the floor with a photographer's unclaimed pictures of newly-weds and
families. Someone has laid out corpses of pigeons in a progressing
series of age and decay. Nobody will see this work.
* PROCESS (TEN 28) will create two works in Glasgow this year: Hill at
Castlemilk in June, and Mr Porter planned for September at Tramway.

THE gap between defending champion Stephen Hendry and Tony Drago could
have been much wider when the pair left the table at the Crucible last
night, but a two-frame overnight night lead would not have prevented the
top seed from sleeping, writes James Traynor.
When he returns today he should be able to extend his sequence of
victories over the sixteenth seed to nine.
Hendry, who is attempting to become the first player to win four
successive world championships, was ahead 4-1 in the second-round match
which will not finish until tomorrow, but some slack play allowed Drago
back in.
In the sixth frame, Hendry had collected 68 points, and with only 61
left on the table the cue ball dropped in as he tried to pot a pink and
his Maltese opponent cut the deficit to 4-2. Hendry missed an easy brown
at a critical stage in the next frame and Drago was only one frame
behind.
At this point, Hendry's manager Ian Doyle was running his fingers
through his hair and bemoaning the fact that his player was not
employing enough safety, but it was almost as though the champion was
teasing his supporters.
Suddenly, in the final frame of the evening, Hendry was back in the
groove and Drago could do no more than sit and watch.
Hendry won the frame 103-8 to go back to his hotel with a decent lead
although Doyle remained annoyed. Hendry wore a slight smile and probably
told his manager to relax, but of course he knows that won't happen
until another world title has been secured.
Meanwhile, snooker's marathon match eventually finished with Northern
Ireland's Joe Swail beating Bedford's Nigel Gilbert 10-8 after almost
eight hours.
The match had been scheduled to finish yesterday afternoon, but the
players had to leave the arena at 9-8 to make way for the evening
session.
Swail came back to take the match with a 63-33 success in a 35-minute
eighteenth frame. He now meets Liverpool's John Parrott in the second
round, starting tomorrow.
Derbyshire's Nigel Bond was also involved in a long-running final
first-round match against Trowbridge's Stephen Lee. Bond won 10-8 and
will meet Scotland's Alan McManus in the second round.

IN 1990, The Business Investment Group approached Stuart McKill, the
then chief executive of Hunter Timber and Mallinson Denny Scotland with
a proposal. If he was prepared to invest some of his money in Ceramic
Tile Distributors, who were in receivership at the time, then so were
they.
''It was a very well established company that had gone wrong,'' said
McKill. ''I found out that the Clydesdale Bank was willing to come back
in, which made a big difference and influenced my decision, as I
believed that there was a business there.''
McKill has since been proved correct, as the company have become one
of Scotland's largest tile distributors with a #4m turnover and a staff
of 34.
What sets McKill apart, perhaps, is a human touch in the art of man
management that, it could be argued, few other men in power possess. ''I
felt that when I came here we had to get back to basics as far as the
running of the business was concerned,'' he said.
''This is a simple business, and we have had three very good years.
Last year is up a third on the one before, and that's because everyone
knows what is expected of them. They are all part of a team.''
That means that every member of staff is on a profit-related pay
scheme, and profitability is monitored constantly with staff. ''I've
just held a presentation at the Rotunda for all of our people,'' says
McKill, flourishing a flip chart decorated with numbers.
''I went through our sales figures, our gross profit, the balance
sheet and the bottom line. I feel that it is important that everyone
knows how we are doing at any given time.''
Secrecy, McKill said, has little part to play in his business.
''Each person must then understand how their efforts affect the
company. Obviously the most important aspect of the business is
achieving sales but we must appreciate how attitudes to internal
disciplines and efficient working impact on the business. I find now
that some of the best ideas come from the staff in their efforts to
improve.''
More importantly, for a man who leaves the suburbs of Edinburgh at six
o'clock in the morning to travel to Glasgow's Clydeside six days a week,
McKill is a believer in working ''on'' the business and not ''in'' it.
''It was a typical building sector company when we took it over,'' he
said. ''There was masses of stock -- we have cut that by a third -- poor
disciplines, and bad systems -- which have now been upgraded to a fully
integrated package.
''To me the most gratifying thing has been to see the staff respond,
because, let's not forget, these are the same people who were here when
I arrived. They now do a better job. They are the key to the business.''
Be prepared to see McKill in the market to buy and then turn round
other businesses, all, of course, with the human touch. And, as befits
someone from auld reekie making it through in the West, working ''on''
and not ''in'' the business.

A NEW industrial development in Hamilton has been awarded one of
theEurope's highest ''green'' ratings.
Built by Akeler (Scotland) Ltd on the biggest single site within the
Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone, the #7.4M first phase of Hamilton
International Technology Park totals some 100,000 sq ft in two recently
completed buildings.
Using an assessment method soon to be adopted by the EU, top marks
were given by the Government's Building Research Establishment (BRE) for
high standards of energy efficiency, low levels of carbon dioxide
emissions (greenhouse gases), and water-saving taps installed throughout
the buildings.
The units at Hamilton International are the first speculative
industrial units in Scotland to achieve a ''very good'' rating under the
new standards, which puts them into the top league of
environmentally-friendly buildings in Europe.
Andrew Goodwin of the independent London-based architects and energy
consultants ECD, was appointed by BRE to examine Hamilton International.
He said: ''The issues addressed during the assessment range from
global atmospheric pollution and depletion of natural resources, to the
effect the development will have on the surrounding area and the quality
of the internal environment. A 'very good' rating is a considerable
achievement which demonstrates that the buildings have been designed to
have a lower environmental impact than other standard buildings of the
same type, whilst providing a pleasant working environment.''
A joint venture company, Akeler (Scotland) Ltd was formed just over a
year ago between Scottish Enterprise, Lanarkshire Development Agency and
Akeler Developments plc, a specialist Enterprise Zone developer, to
construct the advance factories.
The development is linked to the nearby A725 East Kilbride Expressway
by a newly completed interchange provided by the LDA at a cost of
#2.5million.
Mark Glatman, an Akeler (Scotland) director, said: ''These are the
first of a new generation of buildings in Scotland, built to a
specification that quite simply makes them the best available in the
country. From the very beginning we were determined to make Hamilton
International Technology Park as environmentally friendly as possible
with buildings that are pleasant for people to work in and that also
make economic sense in terms of running costs.''
The non-rusting aluminium roofs, along with walls made from brick and
composite cladding, mean that the buildings will be virtually
maintenance-free -- a factor which contributed to the green rating. High
levels of insulation and efficient boilers mean the energy consumption
of the buildings will be lower than in traditional industrial buildings
of a similar size.
Work starts on Goodyear site
WORK has begun on a #1m industrial development at the former Goodyear
site on Glasgow's Great Western Road, writes Stewart McIntosh. The
project has been hailed by a local councillor as representing an
opportunity for job creation and economic regeneration in the area.
The industrial development represents the public sector's share of
Great Western Business Park, a large-scale mixed scheme which is under
construction on the former tyre factory site where private sector
developers are also building retail and business park units.
A seven-acre plot on the site has been bought by Strathclyde Regional
Council from Ramjet Developments Ltd. It will be developed by
Strathclyde Business Development, the economic development arm of the
regional council, as workspace units measuring from 500 to 5000 sq ft.
Councillor Charlie Gordon, the local regional councillor, said: ''The
regional council acknowledges that the provision of modern, efficient
business accommodation is a key element in the economic regeneration of
any area and this project is a good example of the type of accommodation
which is required by new businesses. I am confident that the units will
let quickly, producing much needed job opportunities for the people of
the area.''
Located on one of the main routes into Glasgow, the majority of Great
Western Business Park is being developed by Atlas Investments Ltd and
Ramjet Developments Ltd, in association with Chartwell Land and other
developers.
The work will provide properties suitable for a mix of commercial,
leisure, and residential uses.

MOIRA Copland, owner of Glasgow's Cake and Sugarcraft Emporium on
Clarkston Road, has been enjoying the sweet taste of success, since she
opened for business in April, last year.
''I worked in chemist shops for many years,'' explained Moira. ''That
gave me a firm grounding in retailing, and, as a sugarcraft enthusiast,
I decided to combine business and pleasure by opening up on my own
account.''
The shop supplies amateurs and professionals of the sugarcraft scene,
alike. And, much to Moira's surprise, the mail order side of the
business has grown almost as fast as the over-the-counter sales.
''One of the reasons I went into business was that I had to send off
to England for many of the tools and raw materials of the sugarcraft
trade,'' she commented. ''Now I'm supplying myself, and, thanks to
adverts in trade press, I've picked up mail order customers all over
Scotland, England, and as far away as Japan. I had no idea that my sugar
flowers, sugar paste, moulds, and icing would travel as far as that.''
But the shop's bread and butter, if such a mundane and basic foodstuff
should be mentioned in connection with Moira's exotic wares, remains the
many sugarcraft fans, men and women, who call in to buy the basics of
the art.
And the emporium has diversified into the training business, too, with
Moira running classes at the shop.
''There are many people who want to learn the basic and the finer
points of cake decoration,'' enthused Moira.
And many of the customers calling in at Clarkston Road are in business
themselves.
''There's been a great demand for speciality cakes, and many of my
regulars bake and ice them for individual clients. We get to know one
another and I'm able to supply them with ornaments, icing, and edible
decorations,'' she added.
With sugarcraft fans working for Moira during the week, Saturday is
the time to call on the help of the icing queen's 15-year-old daughter,
Kirsti.
''I'm a sugarcraft fan myself,'' said Kirsti, as she gave due teenage
praise to her mother's latest masterpiece, fashioned for critical
examination by her evening class tutor at Langside College. ''It's not
bad,'' admitted Kirsti.
Nearly one year on, with valuable experience of sales, a cake tin and
stand hire service and a mail order business all firmly under her belt,
Moira is looking towards the first birthday of her Cake and Sugarcraft
Emporium.
And, of course, she and Kirsti are planning a special cake to mark the
event.
How better to celebrate the sweet taste of success?

WHAT common bond unites Prince Charles, the wife of a visiting Arab
ambassador, and the irrepressible Pat Lally, leader of Glasgow City
Council?
What they all share is a great love for macaroons but it must be the
hand-made macaroons produced by Threepwood Fayre. And they're just as
keen to guzzle the coconut tablet, the chocolate fudge, the rum
truffles, and the whisky tablet, all of them made by hand by Anne
Dobbie, the company's founding owner.
Threepwood Fayre was established five years ago by Anne and her
husband John. It operates from a timber-clad portacabin high in a fold
of the hills of North Ayrshire, set up close beside the farm-house
family home.
And it was family priorities, and their fundamental re-evaluation
which came with starting a family, which caused Anne to consider setting
the business in motion.
She had qualified with a degree in hotel and catering management from
Ross Hall, and until the birth of her first child, had worked for 12
years in industry as catering manageress for British Alcan in Glasgow.
Anne knew that her commitment to her family would prevent her returning
to full-time employment; but she knew as well that the family needed a
second income. And finally, and most important, she also knew that she
was very good at making sweets.
Every year at Christmas time she used to make chocolates and sweets
which the employees of Alcan could buy at the canteen. These had sold
well, and so the idea of developing a wider range of sweets and making a
business out of her skill seemed an obvious option.
From first inception of the idea to final production and sale of the
little cellophane and ribbon-tied bags of hand-made Scottish sweets took
a year. This delay was not caused by any lack of enthusiasm or
commitment.
It was, rather, the consequence of the Dobbies' determination to
establish a business which had the lowest of overheads, could be
personally controlled by the two of them, and which would have the
highest production standards.
The first hurdle to be overcome was that of obtaining planning
permission to build a separate kitchen for the making of the sweets. The
Dobbies had to convince the planning authorities that their rustically
camouflaged Portakabin was no threat to the country environment.
Meanwhile, Anne was developing her recipes and searching for suitable
packaging. She was also scouring the country for suppliers who would be
willing to sell in the tiny quantities which were wanted initially. The
couple were both involved also in designing and printing their emblem
and labels, writing their publicity material and doing their market
research.
They were determined to do everything themselves in order to keep
their costs to a minimum. And they have nothing but praise for the
assistance, both financial and practical, given to them by Ayrshire
Enterprise.
Now five years on, Threepwood Fayre is firmly established as a
supplier of a dozen different kinds of high quality hand-made sweets and
petit fours. And its customers range from the Kelvin Hall, when it was
the venue for the world badminton championships and 3000 people were
passing through, to small tourist shops in holiday resorts all over the
country. From large international functions at the Glasgow City
Chambers, where the district council is keen to fly the flag for good
local products with a distinctive Scottish flavour, to the local garage
where the man buying petrol also wants to buy a sweet something for his
wife.
What these customers all liked, says Dobbie, was the fact that they
were buying something distinctly Scottish, something hand-made and
something special -- half way between a confection and a gift.
And it is at this stage that another ingredient of Threepwood Fayre's
sweet success becomes evident -- the Dobbies are providing a service
second to none.
Anne has been known to work through the night so as not to disappoint
customers; and at Christmas last year, she even worked for 48 hours
without a break, boiling, mixing, dipping the sweets in nuts or
chocolate or coconut, filling the baskets and boxes all to keep pace
with her customers' demands.
Working those sort of hours, little wonder, she says, that her
television is the most vital piece of kitchen equipment in her
Portacabin.

BRITISH Airways yesterday reversed a modest 3p loss in falling share
markets to stand at 402p, up 1p on the day, after USAir, its 24.6%-owned
US associate, unveiled a better-than-expected performance in the first
quarter of 1995 with losses reduced to $1.91 per share against $3.64 a
year earlier.
Operating losses fell from $140m to $42m on revenues up from #1685m to
#1763m.
USAir also confirmed that it had ended the period with cash in excess
of $400m though some of that was due to flow out. It did, though, expect
to end the year with at least this much ''barring unforeseen
circumstances''.
Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive officer, said that
''everyone in the company has been intensily focused on the dual goals
of cutting costs and improving service, and the results from the first
quarter show that these efforts are taking hold''.
He said the cost reduction and revenue enhacement efforts were
continuing, adding: ''We are making progress toward the $1000m solution
to make USAir a cost-competitive airline.''
The carrier has been attempting to put together a pay and conditions
deal with employees for more than a year and speculation that British
Airways may be forced to make a writedown on its holding had been
growing. The UK carrier paid $400m for its stake which is on British
Airways' book at #261m.
''The results show a major reduction in its rate of loss and it made
comments about prospects for the summer looking encouraging, so fears
about British Airways writing down its stake have receded somewhat,''
commented the sector analyst at Paribas.
Last month, Warren Buffett, the US investment guru, struck a blow at
USAir by writing down the value of his investment company's stake in the
airline by $268.5m (#163m) to $89.5m. At the time British Airways
reaffirmed that it would only consider a write-down if there was a
permanent diminution in the value of its investment.
The company also said that its position was different from Mr
Buffett's in that for him it was just an investment, whereas for British
Airways it was part of a wider partnership.
USAir's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, suggested a few days ago that the
carrier would find it difficult to survive if it failed to win labour
concessions. But this related to the company's situation at the end of
1994 and since then some progress has been made with the unions, though
no deal covering all levels of employees has yet been finalised.
It is believed that the pilots have agreed a pay cut in return for
seats on the board and profit-sharing, though this would be subject to
the agreement of shareholders, including British Airways. The deal is
understood to be conditional on other employees accepting similar terms.
British Airways agreed with USAir's assessment that KMPG had been
''ultra cautious'' in its regular quarterly report to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
But although it is not considering any write-down in the book value of
its investment, it could re-negotiate its relationship with USAir in the
light of the changes taking place, such as proposed union representation
in the boardroom, which is unlikely to be to the UK company's liking.

THE expertise of owner-manager entrepreneurs is being harnessed in the
drive to boost Scotland's business birthrate.
Through a scheme put into action in October 1993, Government agency
Scottish Enterprise is aiming for the creation 25,000 new businesses by
the turn of the century, effectively increasing the start-up rate by
50%.
A new seven-strong Business Birthrate Advisory Panel, comprising
people with experience of founding and growing companies, will assist in
this effort.
Alastair Balfour, managing director of The Insider Group publishing
house in Edinburgh and chairman of the panel, said: ''The drive to
increase new business in Scotland is extremely important. A lot of
interesting developments are taking place and it is important Scottish
business has an input.''
Among the other members of the panel are Eddie Thompson, chief
executive of rapidly expanding Dundee-based convenience store chain
Morning Noon &amp; Night, and Trudy MacKenzie, who runs Paisley-based
information management consultancy Esteem.
Scottish Enterprise believes the VAT registration-based start-up
statistics currently available miss new businesses at the smaller end of
the scale.
In conjunction with the four Scottish clearing banks, it has been
examining the feasibility of measuring business creation through the
opening of new bank accounts.
Scottish Enterprise's business development director, Russel Griggs,
hopes a new set of quarterly or half-yearly start-up figures could be
produced soon.

Matthew Spicer finds a university archeology department expert in
digging up funding
IF you were asked to nominate the thrusting entrepreneurs at Glasgow
University, you would probably not consider the apparently dusty,
crusty, Department of Archaeology.
The department's entrepreneurial wing, GUARD, may be based in a
basement with its researches equally subterranean, but there's nothing
prehistoric in its approach to business.
GUARD (Glasgow University Archaeology Research Division) recognised
very early the problems inherent in the new funding regime for higher
education in general, and the Archaeology department in particular.
Archaeological projects are less likely these days to be funded by
academic or environmental bodies than by agencies directly involved in,
say, road construction or commercial building -- in other words, the
developer now pays.
In addition to contracts from central and local government, from
private industry and individuals, GUARD has also generated significant
additional work by putting forward ideas for archaeological exploration
and by going out to capture funding from conventional sources like
trusts and other public bodies.
With a turnover of anything between #250,000 and #350,000 per annum,
it has also been able substanially to improve the employment prospects
of the department's graduates. There are four additional archaeologists
currently on full-time contracts and three part-time, where previously
extra staff were hired on an ad hoc basis.
GUARD was launched in the spring of 1989 by a small group within the
Archaeology department -- including its first director, Dr Stephen
Driscoll, a specialist in the early Christian era in Scotland and its
financial manager, Dr William Hanson, a leading expert on Roman Britain.
Alan Leslie, the current director, is also a Roman specialist with
expertise in excavation, field survey and aerial photographic
transcription.
The intention of the founding fellows was not simply to organise
themselves to take advantage of the new funding opportunities and to
conduct better quality research. It was also to meet the university's
obligation to preserve and explain Scotland's past.
There is a statutory requirement for archaeological coverage of any
site under development which has already been scheduled as an ancient
monument. Historic Scotland must be satisfied that work will not affect
known archaeology or will at least deal with it appropriately. In
general, however, developers are not required by law to bring in the
archaeologists. It has simply become good practice in the planning
process.
Most of GUARD's work has therefore come from the Scottish Office,
Historic Scotland or the regional archaeologists employed by local
government to observe central government guidelines. The upgrading of
the A74 to motorway status, for example, brought GUARD a splendid and
well-funded opportunity to develop a broader understanding of the
archaeology of south west Scotland by examining a section of the area in
detail. It also delivered one of the most exciting discoveries of recent
years.
The team was alerted to the possibility of a Knights Templar chapel
near Lockerbie. In the event, it wasn't there, but a pre-historic site
of some significance was unearthed. A few miles up the road, as part of
an overall assessment along the line of the motorway, field-walking
revealed a mesolithic settlement almost exactly where it was intended to
build a service station. Texaco-Blue-Boar agreed to fund the excavation
and their service station will accomodate exhibitions to commemorate the
discovery.
Another team has a watching brief in coastal Fife at the moment on a
golf course development where there are known to be Bronze Age and early
medieval settlements. Thanks to a combined effort by the regional
archaeologist, Historic Scotland and GUARD, the development is able to
proceed with only brief stoppages to examine and record anything
significant.
As Alan Leslie is at pains to point out, only a proportion of an
archaeologist's time is devoted to fieldwork. Much more is spent working
on the materials that have been discovered and excavated. At any moment,
GUARD will have between six and 10 major projects progressing towards
publication.
0 Although GUARD has been financially successful under his management,
Dr Hanson is worried that the Government will regard achievements of
this kind as an excuse for even greater stringency. ''Our focus must be
on archaeology as a research programme, not on making a profit. We are
not in it for the money, we are in it for the archaeology,'' he said.
Of course, quality research needs financial backing and two current
projects, different in scale but both conceived by GUARD, show how the
idea and the money can be happily married.
One is a massive study of Bronze Age Orkney burial grounds, generated
by GUARD's Jane Downes, for which funding was successfully sought from
Historic Scotland on the strength of her project planning.
The other, developed by Dr Stephen Driscoll and involving student
participation, was a medieval excavation at Govan Old Parish Church
backed by Glasgow District Council.
The sophistication of the modern planning process should mean that
GUARD has a secure future. Certainly, in most cases, an archaeological
survey will go ahead of development rather than a team being rushed in
to sweep up after the bulldozers. There is, however, one practical
uncertainty.
''We have been fighting for years,'' says Dr Hanson, ''to get
archaeologists appointed in all the regions, but we haven't even
succeeded in doing that -- Tayside and Lothian still don't have one.
That's why we are concerned at the moment about the impact of the new
local government reform. Not all the new smaller units are going to
employ archaeologists.''

WHEN Frances Black came to live with her husband, Richard, on the
family farm 20 years ago, she never dreamt that she would be running an
equine centre to generate an important part of the farm income.
But then, Richard could hardly have forseen the advent of set-aside
and the crisis of over-production that would come to haunt the Common
Agricultural Policy and change the face of Scottish agriculture.
Frances Black explained, ''When Richard came back to the farm after
finishing college in 1966, there were seven men employed on the farm.
Now there are none, and they call that progress! It's a shame but the
return just doesn't allow us to employ workers.''
In 1989, uncertain about the future of traditional farming and with
time on her hands when her youngest child went to secondary school,
Frances began to cast about for an alternative source of income.
She said: ''Richard was born on the farm and he would like to pass it
on to our son who is very keen on farming. We wanted to keep the farm,
our home here and the farming way of life.
''I didn't want to return to work in an office, I enjoy the outdoors
too much.''
Two or three small building plots were sold off and the options of a
opening a clay-pigeon range or developing a golf course were considered
and then dismissed before Frances, who had previously ridden horses as a
pastime, decided to open a cross country training course for the growing
number of riding enthusiasts.
Advised by a friend on lay-out, and assisted with publicity by the
North East Fife Enterprise Trust, Frances found that the course quickly
proved popular.
The Braeside Cross Country Training Course is now laid out over 70
acres of hilly grazing land with 60 jumps of varying degrees of
difficulty offering challenges to riders of all abilities. Around 800
riders from as far away as Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeenshire now
travel to Braeside to pay #7 per hour to exercise their horses and
practise the jumps.
Frances recalled, ''The cross country course fitted the bill in that
it required very little capital outlay and we did not require things
like planning permission. If it didn't work out, we could just cut up
the jumps for firewood.
''If you applied strict cost accounting to the business in the early
days, I'm not sure that it would have looked very profitable. Strictly
speaking, it was subsidised by the farm -- which supplied timber and
machinery. And, of course, I had to put in a lot of my own time.
''But it has now expanded to provide an important part of farm income
and, hopefully, that will continue to grow. We take a lot of care to
find out what our customers want. We started off with just 10 jumps and
have added to that figure each year.''
The weather, the farmer's old adversary, remains a problematic factor
for the new business.
Frances explained: ''Ours is very much a seasonal business running
from March to October. The busiest time is in the spring when people are
keen to get their horses out after the winter. If you hit bad weather
then, as we did this year, you never make it up. I don't allow people
out if the conditions are anything less than safe.''
Although the farm steading has seven stables, Frances has not expanded
the business to offer a livery service but that could change. ''We do
offer some tuition at the moment with freelance trainers. And after the
first couple of years we did consider opening a proper riding centre,
although the cost of showers and toilets was prohibitive.
''There is no doubt that, as the business grows, there is scope for
development. Families come here for the day and have a picnic after they
have jumped for an hour. My daughter, Carolyn, is an enthusiastic
showjumper and she is currently learning how to be a trainer.
''If she decides that she wants to join the business, then we will
definitely look to expand by maybe building an outdoor school and
offering training. We are also thinking about bringing in young horses
and training them for sale,'' she said.
Braeside is now a firm fixture on the circuit of the increasing number
of ''saddle tramp'' holidaymakers who stay overnight in B &amp; B
accommodation and exercise their horses during the day. Bookings from
pony clubs are also on the increase.
But Frances remains philosophical. ''If the business continues to grow
the way it has been, it will become a major part of farm income. But
there are no guarantees.''

With falling harvests almost every year, a delegation of Russians
visited Scotland recently to sow seeds for closer co-operation between
the two countries
SCOTTISH farming and meat industry representatives recently
entertained a visiting group of agriculturists from Russia's Orenburg
region with a gruelling schedule of visits to Scottish dairy, meat, and
grain processing organisations.
Organised in conjunction with the Edinburgh-based Russian
Communications Company and hosted by Russia's Consulate General in
Melville Street, the event was designed to widen the Russians'
opportunities for developing co-operation with their Scottish
counterparts.
According to the Russian Communications Company, Russia's private
farming sector now owns five per cent of the total farm land and will
this year provide six per cent of total agricultural output.
In June of last year, Mr Vladimir Bashmachnikov, president of the
Russian Farmers Association, said that in spite of economic
difficulties, farmers had sown seed on 85% of their land.
The Russian Central Bank also stressed that this was all the more
praiseworthy given the fact that, of 450 billion roubles in credits
issued to Russian farmers, only 350 billion had been claimed by mid-year
1994.
Although Russian government bodies are presently liaising with
international support agencies and are introducing legislation designed
to help farmers, the latter admit that the industry's problems dictate
the need for strong investment from foreign backers.
Throughout 1994, reports the Russian Economics Ministry: ''Following a
decrease in the production of foodstuffs, Russian consumption of staples
was last year on a downward track.''
Compared to the average yearly consumption of basic foods from 1986 to
1990, individual consumption of meat, butter, vegetable oil, sugar and
fish was halved.
During the period 1990-94, production of meat and meat products
dropped 65%, that of butter 48%, sugar 58%, confectionery products 47%,
canned fruit and vegetables 62%, vegetable oil 31%, pasta products 37%
and salt 52%.
Harvesting sufficient grain crops for 1995-96 is also likely to be a
difficult process.
Compared to the 1993 average, the amount of land sown with winter
crops fell by one million hectares, while last year's total of land
ploughed for spring sowing fell by 600,000 hectares.
According to Russia's Economics and Life Magazine, by November 1,
1994, farmers' fodder stock piles were 13% down on the 1993 levels. By
December 1, 1994, purchases of livestock and poultry, milk and eggs by
state procurement companies had dropped to 77%, 76% and 90%
respectively.
Moscow News have reported that government analysts last year expected
a gross grain yield of 80-82 million tonnes, against 99 million tonnes
gathered in 1993, and 90-100 million tonnes forecast for this year.
Heavy snowfalls in western and eastern Siberia reportedly resulted in
40% of crops being unharvested.
The greatest drop was expected in the wheat harvest with the predicted
crop of 30-35 million tonnes falling well below the 1993 total of 43
million tonnes.
To ease the industry's government credit debts, the Yeltsin
administration has written off the 1994 debts of the federal grain and
regional food reserves agency Roskhlebprodukt, but expects procurement
from and sales of grain by Russian farmers to be speeded up.
On the tinned and frozen meats import front, foreign suppliers have
cornered large chunks of the Russian consumer market. Companies like
Denmark's Tulip, and Holland's Struik concern, predict a surge in sales
this spring but are worried about the possible changes in Customs duties
and about the EU's reduction by 50% of subsidies to livestock breeders.
Until recently EU subsidies amounted to $270 per tonne.
On a more positive front, Magnitogorsk Metal Works is setting an
example by announcing the completion of a new meat processing plant. The
total contractual value of the project, which is being carried out by
Condor Autex of Australia, is $8 million. Processing capacity per shift
is 30 tonnes of meat, of which 30% per shift will come from the
factory's nearby farm. The remaining capacity will be leased to other
suppliers.
Phase Two production will introduce the processing of sausages, ham,
and meat loaf. Canned meat will be produced using tin processed by the
company's metalworks.
Interest in the new plant has come from equipment suppliers in
Germany, Holland, Australia and Spain.
In Glasgow's twin city of Rostov-on-Don, the Rostselmash joint stock
company was last month granted a Russian Government loan of 80 billion
roubles.
A major producer of farm machinery Rostselmash has experienced recent
cash flow difficulties but Moscow technocrats have stipulated that the
new loan be used to ''restore the production of harvesters for their
subsequent delivery to a leasing fund which, in turn, will sell
machinery to farm producers''.
Rostselmash is also to receive an export credit. Money from the
leasing fund sales will also be fed back to the company which is being
granted a five-year tax privileges deal. Government economists also aim
to reduce the cost of transporting farm machinery.
David Petherick, managing director of the Russian Communications
Company, confirmed that he will be acting on behalf of the Orenburg
group in future negotiations with Scottish clients and invites
interested parties to contact him at RCC's Edinburgh headquarters.

NOW Russia's largest export market, Britain last year accounted for
16.8% of all exports and was the federation's third largest non-CIS
trading partner after Germany and America, writes Alan Newark.
According to the Commersant Daily newspaper, Russia's exports to
Britain were accounted for largely by the raw materials and primary
fuels, a scenario which the federation's UK trade representative Nikolai
Telyatnikov would like to see balanced by a greater emphasis upon
semi-processed and finished goods.
Speaking at Grampian Regional Council's recent Opportunities for Trade
with Russia conference, Mr Telyatnikov said that Russia has 200 joint
ventures with British capital and that 80% of these are in the trade and
services sector.
Inspecting the Dundee production plant of Rubicon (Contracts) Ltd., Mr
Telyatnikov later heard managing director Bob Johnson describe how the
company's office furniture is sold in Russia bringing measurable
benefits for Rubicon's Russian investors.
One of 13 UK and European firms represented at the Krasny Yar Business
Centre in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Rubicon plans to market
products which will be manufactured from Russian timber.
Recently launched by the Dundee-based Siberian Trading Company, the
Krasny Yar business centre was the brainchild of STC international
business development director Bill Rodgers.
Mr Rodgers, who joined STC in early 1994 after a successful spell as
group operations director of a well known UK manufacturer, also helped
to recruit companies willing to market goods and services in Siberia.
Other firms represented in Krasnoyarsk include Joiner and Timber
Creations of Dundee, Floorcraft Limited of Alyth in Perthshire, Barrhead
Sanitaryware of Hillington, and Klick Photopoint of Byres Road in
Glasgow.
''We are now able to offer Scottish companies a safe and expertly
guided entry to a vast and lucrative market,'' said Mr Rodgers. ''Our
partners in Krasnoyarsk are a group of Siberian businessmen whose early
interest in trade with Scotland has enabled STC to conduct almost four
years of successfull trading relations in that city.''
Expanding contact with Scottish companies is also a primary task of
Russia's consul general in Scotland, Mr Gennadi Lazutkin, who last week
invited Scottish business representatives to meet a visiting group of
Russian agriculturalists from the Orenberg region.

THE credit card market is nothing if not competitive these days, with
banks regularly offering special deals to entice consumers to swap their
current card for a new all-singing-all-dancing slice of plastic.
Competitive it may be but the market is still growing rapidly and as
long as their credit control is sound it is a lucrative area for the
banks given the high interest rate charged on debit balances, backed by
payments from retailers.
Lower interest rates compared to a few years ago are also to card
issuers' advantage. Each one point reduction in base rates cuts the cost
of funding card holders who pay off their balance in full by the end of
the free credit period by #30m.
About a third of the #10bn of balances outstanding are paid off in
this way. So it is not surprising that more issuers have entered the
fray.
A powerful new competitor has now come on the scene with American
Express launching its first general credit card. With its strong Amex
brand and an attractive interest rate of 16.7%, against a typical rate
exceeding 20%, the bank is determined to carve out a market share
commensurate with its size, which can only be good news for all credit
card holders as it puts pressure on other issuers to improve their
terms.
There are about a million UK holders of Amex charge cards, some of
whom also have the existing Amex Optima credit card, but the new card
will be marketed to all.
The launch rather stole the thunder from Barclaycard which also
announced new cards, Barclaycard Sense, aimed at those wary of cards in
general, and Barclaycard Gold, aimed at those wanting a higher credit
limit and various benefits, and are prepared to pay an annual fee of
#30.
The industry had two relatively lean years in 1992 and 1993 though
credit card use continued to grow by over 6% annually, but last year
growth shot up to 9%, according to the Credit Card Research Group.
Borrowing on plastic is falling overall compared with total card
usage, with consumers reluctant to increase their commitments and also
more aware of its cost.
Plastic is continuing to gain ''market share'' at the expense of cash
and cheques (when was the last time you saw someone paying at a till
with a cheque?).
Card issuers have invested heavily to reduce costs, with fraud and bad
debts much reduced through, for example, more secure delivery methods
and the use of sophisticated credit and behaviourial scoring. Photo
cards are used by surprisingly few issuers and the Continental practice
of requiring customers to back their cards by inputting a PIN number on
a special keypad has never been suggested here.
The use of debit cards such as Switch is growing faster than credit
cards and for the first time last year there were more transactions
involving debit than credit cards -- 807 million against 804 million to
be precise. They have started from a lower base, the number of outlets
accepting them has expanded rapidly and credit cards have been hit by
consumers' greater reluctance to get involved in more credit. This
suggests that they are restricting credit card growth but in fact there
is little evidence for this.
Debit cards are used mostly for paying for the weekly supermarket shop
(where the cashback facility is most useful) and for filling the car
with petrol, perhaps because people baulk at paying for groceries ''on
tick''. Although debit card use in supermarkets has soared by two-thirds
in two years, food and drink is the second-highest growth sector for
credit cards as well.
The use of debit cards may actually be encouraging more people to
obtain credit cards as it makes them become more comfortable with using
plastic.
Plastic may appear ubiquitous but only a quarter of retail sales are
made with it and even in supermarkets they account for only half of
sales. So there is plenty of scope for growth yet, even though it is
difficult to see many more new users coming forward given the 40%
penetration now achieved.
Further in the future lies the prospect of the ''smart'' card which
will carry an electronic chip and enable the holder to keep an instant
check on his bank balance.
The problem with plastic is the way cards tend to proliferate in
wallets and handbags. People who pay off their debit balance each month
hardly need a credit card at all (except for foreign travel). A debit
card would be more suitable, particularly as they often double up as
cash dispenser and cheque guarantee cards.
Or they could dispense with a debit card and have one of the affinity
cards which donate small sums to charity, typically 25p per month for
every #100 spent. An average spend of #500 a month would translate into
#15 a year for charity which is worth having.
As for borrowing, credit cards may be all right for the odd dip into
the red but the consumer should look elsewhere if he or she needs credit
for a specific purpose or regularly needs significant levels of credit.
A personal loan will be better value for the former and will also
impose a discipline on repayment, while an overdraft will be much
cheaper for the regular borrower. Some Gold cards provide this facility
for a rate typically 2.5% over base, though there is also a fixed annual
charge of around #70.

Thirty years ago, private companies were banned but today Zhou Jian
intends his finance his company's burgeoning growth by the first share
offer to the Chinese people
SEVEN years ago, Zhou Jian was earning $14 a month as a researcher
into water treatment. Now he wants his $1.9m company to be China's first
private firm to sell shares to the public.
''We urgently need financing because we are growing so fast,'' Zhou,
31, said in an interview. ''But borrowing from banks and private
individuals is difficult or costly, so selling shares to the public
would be the best way to raise capital.''
Zhou epitomises a new breed of private entrepreneur in Shanghai, a
specialist who gave up a safe, if poorly paid, job in the government to
go into business in what has become the city's fastest growing sector.
The number of private companies in Shanghai rose at the end of 1994 to
17,000 from 8000 a year earlier, and just 2200 at the end of 1991. Their
share of the city's gross domestic product rose to 5.3 per cent in 1994
from 3.4 per cent in 1993.
Zhou is president of Shanghai Well Enterprise, with more than 10
subsidiaries and total assets of 16 million yuan ($1.9m), of which 10.5
million ($1.25m) is a plant producing 200 tonnes a year of petrochemical
catalysts in a high technology zone in a suburb of Shanghai.
The group also has a restaurant, accountancy business, advertising
firm, interior decoration company and a firm processing scrap textile
materials.
Shanghai Well was born on August 8, 1988 -- a lucky day for Chinese --
after Zhou and 10 friends borrowed 50,000 yuan ($5950) from friends and
family to make petrochemical equipment in a workshop leased in a middle
school.
The firm has since moved seven times, and turnover has more than
doubled every year. Shanghai Well doubled its workforce to 200 in
January when it acquired a collective firm processing scrap textile
material whose land Zhou wanted for expansion.
''We have diversified as a way to spread our risk and because many
services, such as accounting, are poor in China, so it makes more sense
to have them in-house and also sell them to customers outside,'' he
said.
That was the rationale for spending one million yuan ($119,000) to buy
an ageing restaurant in the centre of Shanghai in January that the
company is refurbishing.
Like all Chinese companies, Shanghai Well has to spend heavily on
entertaining so it made more sense to do it in his own premises. The
restaurant would also help to promote the company's brand name, he said.
The biggest headache has been finding capital to finance the rapid
growth, with most money in state banks allocated to state companies,
Zhou said.
The company can sell as much of the catalyst as it can produce, mostly
to large, state-owned petrochemical firms, and its only competition for
the product Zhou and his colleagues developed on their own comes from
imports.
Shanghai Well reports virtually no profits, preferring to plough
anything it makes back into the business, Zhou said. ''If you make a
profit you are taxed.''
That system cannot cover a large expansion or acquisition of new
businesses.
Zhou hopes to transform Shanghai Well into a shareholding firm in the
second half of this year and to issue shares to the public in 1996 or
1997.
The son of a middle-ranking official in a state firm, Zhou graduated
from Shanghai Petrochemical College in 1983 and went to work for a city
research centre on water treatment.
''I left because I wanted to try something on my own. The income there
was low and there was a gap between the theory in the research centre
and the real world outside,'' he said.
Asked about political risk, he said he expected no major change in
policy on private business, banned for most of the first 30 years of
communist rule in China.
''It is not in the government's interest to change policy. If there
were, who would employ all those who work in private companies? State
firms have too many people,'' he said.
Of Shanghai's 17,000 private companies, about 25 per cent were started
by educated people such as Zhou, and 20 per cent were consultancies or
in high-technology, one Shanghai economist said.
''A decade ago, such firms were more politically dangerous,'' he said.
Now the sector has grown so rapidly that most private company owners
have confidence in the future. -- Reuter

MOVES are afoot to combat one of the biggest problems currently facing
fish farmers in Scotland -- tiny parasites called Lepeotherius Salmonis
and Caligus Elongatus, commonly known as sea lice, which can cause
significant damage at fish farms.
The aquatic equivalent of nits in human hair, sea lice hook onto the
skin of a salmon, eating away at the scales, flesh, and blood of the
fish. Those fish which are in any way unhealthy are much more prone to
attack by predators, most notably seals.
Unfortunately, sea lice are present at most fish farms in large
numbers and, as the total life cycle is three weeks and each adult
female can lay hundreds of eggs, infestations can spread rapidly.
Traditional treatments involve regularly bathing the fish in large
quantities of expensive licensed medicines, which can cost up to
#150,000 a year per farm. It is also dangerous to the fish, causing high
levels of stress which can be fatal. After use, these treatments are
then released into the marine environment and the whole process has to
be repeated every six to eight weeks during the season. An additional
disadvantage is that the sea lice gradually build up a resistance to the
chemicals.
Farmers are under increasing pressure to find another means of solving
this problem. This week's TrailBlazers are a young Glasgow company who
have been developing a novel solution.
Terecos Ltd was formed by Baxter Binnie and Maureen Glen last summer.
In their previous jobs with a Glasgow-based instrumentation company,
they had designed and developed a ''seal scarer'' using ultrasonic waves
to keep the predators away from farms and they continue to supply these
both in Scotland and overseas.
''We were then approached by fish farmers who asked if this technology
could be used to scare away sea lice but initial tests showed this
wouldn't work. We also found they were very difficult to kill -- for
example, they can't be electrocuted,'' Baxter Binnie explained.
''However, we did find that sea lice respond to light so, encouraged
by the Scottish Salmon Growers Association, we carried out further tests
and started developing a sea lice lure.''
The lure is electric, powered by a battery and has a life expectancy
of 2-3 years. When activated, the light entices the parasites to move
towards it and when they are close, the water is pumped to the surface
bringing the sea lice up. The water is then strained through a fine net.
It is estimated that the capture volume could be 12 metres round each
lure: an area containing large numbers of sea lice.
''An interesting by-product of the process is that the lure also
attracts natural plankton which could be used as food for young halibut
who are very difficult to rear on artificial foods. This could be of
great assistance in developing halibut farms,'' continued Maureen Glen.
Terecos has started the long process of acquiring a patent and have
recently been awarded support from the Glasgow Innovation Fund. They now
have pre-production prototypes which are currently being tested at
Scottish Salmon Growers Association farms and will soon be tested by the
Institute of Aquaculture at Stirling University. It is hoped all tests
will be concluded by the summer.
Additional funding of around #100,000 is currently being sought to set
up a production line in the hope of producing lures for around #2500 per
unit.
''There has been a tremendous amount of interest from the fish farming
community, not just in Scotland but as far away as Canada and Australia.
We believe the lure has worldwide applications, as similar ones could be
developed for photomechanically-responsive parasites which attack other
types of farmed fish,'' Maureen concluded.

DAVID McLuckie's dad was a coal man who, during the summer months,
sold sand, slabs, and cement, to keep the business ticking over.
But David decided not to follow his father into the business -- at
least not immediately. Instead he became a draughtsman, before starting
up his own transport business.
''My dad's company was not really big enough to support both of us,
and I didn't really fancy working for him,'' he admits.
But then, in 1988, David spotted a gap in the market to focus the
family business on -- becoming a fully fledged building and timber
merchant.
He joined MBT in 1988, when the turnover for the previous year stood
at #287,000 and fresh capital was invested in the company.
The coal side of the business, which at that time was based in
Kirkintilloch, was sold in 1989 and the company rapidly expanded into
building materials with John Innes joining the company.
''John had been in the business since he left school,'' explains
David, ''and had a lot of good contacts''.
Today MBT has an annual turnover of #5m and David McLuckie, now the
company's managing director, hopes to double this within the next three
or four years.
Last year MBT moved from Kirkintilloch to a new #1m depot in
Cumbernauld, where they now employ 22 people.
''We still have a small depot in Kirkintilloch where we employ four
people, but our main base is very much Cumbernauld,'' says David.
MBT managed to continue to expand throughout the recession in the
construction industry because, says David McLuckie, most of their
customers at that time were involved in house renovations with housing
associations.
Future expansion, he says, will come through moving into two new areas
-- catering for the DIY market, and also supplying treated timber geared
mainly to tradesmen.
''We have no ambitions to become another B&amp;Q but one of the reasons we
moved to Cumbernauld is that it is now of an age when people will be
renovating their homes and adding to them. We think it is the right
place to be for our type of business.''

IT is impossible to find a single description to fit John Paterson. He
is at the one and same time, farmer, businessman, royal confidant, and
charity fund raiser.
He could not possibly have imagined what lay ahead when, after
completing his studies at the West of Scotland Agricultural College, he
spent eight years as a farm manager near Calgary in Canada.
But any prospect of John going through life in the quiet lane went
straight out the window when, during a return visit to Scotland, he
agreed to become Sir Hugh Fraser's stock ranch manager.
Unwittingly, this decision was to engulf John Paterson in board room
intrigue, multi-million takeover battles, and ultimately with the royal
family.
It is his contact with the Princess Royal which has proved most
satisfying for John, as it has allowed him to help raise several million
pounds for The Princess Royal Trust for Carers.
John managed Sir Hugh Fraser's 10 farms, which between them held 1000
cattle and 2000 sheep for seven years between 1965 and '72, while at the
same time being a director of several of Sir Hugh's private companies.
He then became Sir Hugh's PA, and when Princess Anne and Mark Phillips
were married Sir Hugh asked him to go to Gatcombe Park to help the newly
weds establish a herd of cattle.
John was by Sir Hugh's side during the turbulent battles in the House
of Fraser as Tiny Rowland's Lonrho company fought to gain control of the
store group, and he was deeply saddened by Sir Hugh's death.
He had remained in contact with Princess Anne following his
involvement at Gatcombe Park, and in 1987 he agreed to become the chief
executive of the Mark Phillips Equestrian Centre at Gleneagles.
''I was employed to get the equestrian centre built, and up and
running,'' he recalls, ''and stayed until 1990''.
The next royal call came when the Princess Royal decided to give her
support to launching a charity aimed at helping carers in our society.
''I had discussed with the princess what type of charity she could
become involved in. She wanted something which was not only sensible but
also tackled a real need in society.
''I discussed the matter with several business friends and we came up
with the idea of the The Princess Royal Trust for Carers. It is a
serious area of concern for our society, and one which is too often
forgotten. After all it is so easy to forget that those who care for
sick or elderly relatives need support themselves.''
The trust was launched in October 1991, and John was appointed the
fundraising director. Since then he has helped raise #5m, with #2m of
this total coming from Scotland.
''Our target is to have a carers' centre in every local authority area
in the UK, and to achieve this we believe we need to raise #25m which is
a lot of money but we believe we can do it,'' he says.
When he is not thinking of ways to get more money out of big business
for the trust, John divides his ''spare time'' between overseeing his
Aberfoyle Motor Company, which is involved in timber haulage and school
transport, and his farm.
His wife Lilian breeds Highland Cattle on the 300-acre farm but John
Paterson admits he doesn't get much time to engage in farming
pursuits...he's too busy raising funds.

SINCE that mintel report on the staggering rise in sales of men's
fragrances, a funny thing happens around the office. You can be sitting
at your workstation and suddenly find somebody standing silently behind
you. A bloke.
The natural reaction is to switch off your screen, or hide the
football fanzine, so that he can't spy on you. But he doesn't go. He
stays there, sniffing gently. The conversation goes something like this:
Him: ''Nice day.''
You: ''Not bad. What d'you want?''
Him: ''Just stretching my legs. (Sniff. Sniff) Well, I'll be off
now.''
And that's it. My conclusion is this: Men might well have spent #1.2m
a day last year on body-sprays and aftershave: Scottish men might well
lead Britain in squirting themselves aromatic; the men's niff market
might well have risen by 37 per cent in five years while the women's has
declined: and men might well spend half-an-hour on weekdays and an hour
at weekends on their appearance. But they still have a long way to go.
When these secretive blokes actually start discussing their toiletry
secrets with each other (''Can I have a squirt of yours for a squirt of
mine?'') the manufacturers will really have reached pay day.
Now I'll tell you my toiletry secret. I don't use any of the dratted
sprays at all. That's why these office sniffers standing behind me are
puzzled: they find the aroma -- a modicum of perspiration mixed with
stale cigarette smoke -- strangely comforting. But they can't identify
it.
When the great day arrives, and one of them asks me what it's called,
I'll say: ''It's 'Nostalgia'' mate. But I don't think it's quite you . .
. ''
* Handout Henry, who operates the Nerd House advertising account with
a lot of sweat on his upper lip, was in an unusually cheerful mood last
night at McSonachan's. ''The good times are coming back,'' he said,
consecrating his thrapple with G&amp;T. ''It's going to be fun again, just
like the old days.''
I hated to put a damper on him, but I did anyway. I folded open my
paper at the headline Scotland lags in optimism, and placed it silently
on the bar.
''Not that,'' said Henry scornfully. ''Not that old business
confidence thing. What I'm talking about is advertising, and when it
comes to having fun, advertising leads the way.'' (As McSonachan cleared
the glasses away, I noticed that Henry was into his third large one.)
He told me that the talk of the advertising steamie was about the
elaborate pitches four London agencies put on to try to win the #60m
British Airways account. One completely redecorated its offices before
the airline people came round, and dressed up its ''pitch team'' as if
they were stewards and stewardesses.
Another created a ''space-style'' environment and installed a Van de
Graaff generator for visual effect. ''Imagine it,'' enthused Henry.
''Man made lightning crackling from the generator, the rising enthusiasm
of the pitch team as they unfurled new and brilliant creative concepts .
. . ''
I interrupted: ''The cheesy grins, the sycophancy, the Russian black
caviar on postage-stamp toast.''
He ignored me. ''It's back to the days of true theatre in the pitching
business. None of this sitting around a table in grey suits, looking
glum. Make 'em sit up, make 'em stand and cheer: it's showtime again!
I'll have another of these.''
I signalled McSonachan. It arrived. Suddenly I realised what all this
was about. I asked: ''Aren't you pitching this week to retain the Nerd
House account?'' Henry nodded, and the sweat broke out again on his
upper lip.
So what was it to be? Folies Bergere comes to the Merchant City?
Barnum and Bailey and the sawdust ring? A pitch team dressed like
gridiron footballers?
Henry sighed. ''Nope, afraid not. I once put on a small laser show
operated by my uncle, and your chairman leaned across and grated 'How
much is all this costing?' It's grey suits around a table again.'' He
took out his pen and doctored the headline in my paper to read Scotland
lags in showbiz.

ESTABLISHED organisations servicing commerce have long paid lip
service to exporting but in reality these organisations often have more
immediate priorities which use up their scarce resources.
Even the promotion of government-sponsored bodies over the last two
decades has not fulfilled export expectations.
As a result, one of the most cogent and positive wealth creating
activities carried out by Scottish industry has lacked meaningful core
support and co-ordination. Exporting activity remains devoid of a
fast-reacting independent service with a long-term view of educational
planning and training.
The Scottish Export Association (SEA) has been founded out of this
expressed dissatisfaction.
The new association has been over a year in the planning, in order
that it could come to the market with its structure and services fully
in place.
With access to databases covering over 80 million references around
the world, a significant technical library and links with over 20 other
professional bodies and many Scottish universities and colleges of
further education, the association will give the exporter or potential
exporter a choice of either going to a quango or to an independent
provider of specialist advisory services.
The SEA is prepared to be judged on the scope of its activities and
upon the speed and accuracy of its responses.
Unlike most of the organisations offering similar services, the
association will be wholly specialist in the services it provides. It
will not, for example, duplicate the excellent work carried out by the
Chambers of Commerce, the Scottish Council (Development &amp; Industry) and
others.
The association will concentrate upon seminars on technical and
strategic matters and on offering advisory services on international
trade law, dispute resolution, representation, Customs &amp; VAT, patenting,
quality assurance, staff selection, trade partnering, credit insurance,
factoring, foreign exchange, and means of payment.
Some of this advisory work will be undertaken by a separate trading
company -- to avoid conflicting with the educational function -- and
through a range of extablished professional contacts.
As an immediate priority, the association will seek to create new
educational qualifications with high standards. This will be achieved by
bringing a constructive coherence to existing export training and
education suppliers. Designatory letters will be established to give
exponents a standing in industry.
SEA's new trading company will be incorporated to supply nominated
facilities to companies. The most important of these facilities will be
to help companies achieve ISO 9000 standards.
It will also encourage and manange the establishment of trade
partnerships, networking with Scottish related organisations abroad and,
where applicable, research studies for individual clients.
SEA believes all manufacturers who export or might do so and all
others involved in the export process such as freight forwarders,
international departments of banks, and others, should register for ISO
9000 and Investors in People.
Contentious issues involving the business of exporting will also be
addressed.
For example, SEA will act as a voice, encouraging passive
industrialists who currently manufacture excellent products to consider
exporting as an additional outlet.
To give specialist professional advice requires qualifications and
indemnity but too many purported export advisers have neither. SEA will
cover both through its APL (Accreditation of Prior Learning) diploma and
arrangements with its network of insurance brokers and lawyers.
SEA will also deal with issues of financing. The apparent distancing
by some UK clearing banks from real support for small to medium-sized
businesses is a subject increasingly raised in Scotland. The situation
here contrasts sharply with the financing of similar firms in other
European Union member states. There only 7% of the 14 million registered
businesses employ more than nine people and, as a result, new-start
entrepreneurial endeavour is much encouraged. Small appears to be
beautiful in mainland Europe.
The recent growth of alternative banking outlets in the UK may, in
time, remedy the shortfall in financial support. But if certain British
institutions cannot or will not provide industry with the finance it
requires, then solutions should be sought elsewhere.
It may be some time before British funders will be prepared to support
new start enterprises without the provision of inordinate security --
excluding government grants. The SEA will seek, therefore, to encourage
a return to an element of prudent risk-taking; one which involves a
degree of fearfulness, as distinct from that of being afraid. This is
the denominator in the equation of enterprise which is now missing and
it applies equally to the UK lending and investment markets.
The very independence of the Scottish Export Association will enable
it to support its members in these areas and in a manner not previously
available to the sector.
Quangos cannot be expected to enter the world of political or fiscal
controversy and soundly based job and wealth creation must transcend the
machinations of government.

CULLEN skink, clootie dumpling, and petticoat tails -- all traditional
Scottish delicacies which native Scots will have no trouble in
identifying as familiar forebear fare.
But throw into your hamper ads (as does the company, Good Taste from
Scotland), the phrases De'il's Delight, Mistress McLeod's Fancy and
Cluny's Breakfast, and even your hielan' Granny might be a wee bitty
mystified.
South of the border, they are totally bemused, and not a little
intrigued. In staccato tones, the questions from the Home Counties hum
along the wires; from the depths of the shires come the ringing
enquiries.
And having supplied the answers, Good Taste from Scotland, is well
placed to supply the goodies in question. For this is a company, based
in Glasgow, which specialises in providing hampers of Scottish produce.
And the contents of these hampers are not only exclusively of Scottish
origin -- only the wine is French -- but they are also, says the
publicity director, John Moore, of the finest quality.
For the De'il himself, Mistress McLeod, Cluny (and the Laird of all
the rest of the cast from Good Taste from Scotland's brochure) all have
discerning and sophisticated palates. They all insist on the very best
that Scotland can offer. And on their behalf, Managing Director, Walter
Hayward, has eaten his way through many a gourmet product and delicious
meal to select what he considers to be premier Scots delicacies.
Indeed, says Moore, over the years (now 66 of them) he's taken every
opportunity to enjoy all the best dishes made from Scotland's wealth of
home-produced supplies.
The result is a company which is fine-tuned to fill a niche in the
market for exclusively Scottish foods. And although it was only
established by Hayward and Moore four years ago, it has grown so quickly
in response to customer demand that its turnover last year has topped
#100,000.
Four years ago, when Hayward retired as head of sales for STV, he
decided that he would combine a life-long interest in food with a
profitable second career by establishing a company to supply what he
perceived as a specialised niche in the hamper market.
Here ex-patriate Scots and lovers of all things Scottish could indulge
either themselves or their families, their friends, or their business
colleagues with first class Scottish foods which were not easily
available, except in occasional specialist shops.
Hayward and Moore launched Good Taste from Scotland in a tentative
fashion but were immediately gratified by the interest shown in their
products.
However, it was two years later, when they were joined by David Warden
of Castle Maclellan, a Kirkcudbright company that Good Taste from
Scotland really began to take off.
Warden also had connections with Galloway Gourmets -- a co-operative
of cottage industries making high quality delicacies on a small scale.
They were anxious to extend their market, and their products were ideal
constituents of a typically Scottish hamper.
However, the company is not only dependent on Galloway produce.
Pheasants in white wine sauce come from Ayrshire, smoked salmon from
Fort William, shortbread from Walkers in the Highlands. The key to the
selection is that products should not only be of top quality, but should
also be original -- they should be the sort of treats that would merit a
special occasion.
So far Good Taste from Scotland seems to have achieved its aims. A
large proportion of its orders are from former customers. Perhaps
two-thirds of the hampers are sent to Scottish addresses, while most of
the rest go to England.
However, as the business rapidly expands -- last year the total income
from the south doubled -- two significant trends are emerging. First,
says Moore, there is a steadily growing interest from Canada and the
U.S.
Secondly, and more importantly, there is a large market, which Good
Taste from Scotland is increasingly tapping, in the corporate sector.
Sixty per cent of their hampers already go to companies.
Rosy prospects, then, for all the directors and producers associated
with Good Taste from Scotland; but perhaps especially for Hayward, who
so relishes the exacting task of selection, and gains such immense
satisfaction from it.

EVERTON'S #4m striker Duncan Ferguson went through a hernia operation
yesterday -- but has been told by surgeons that he can still make the FA
Cup final against Manchester United on May 20, writes Ken Gallacher.
Ferguson went off injured in the game against Sheffield Wednesday on
Monday and the injury immediately ruled him out of Scotland's match
against San Marino. It was also feared that he would also miss the
Wembley date, but yesterday there was good news for the big striker.
After the operation, Ferguson phoned his parents in Stirling to tell
them: ''The doctors have told me that there is still the chance that I
can play against Manchester United. ''The operation went well. They
think that I can recover in time to play at Wembley.''

POINT-TO-POINT:
TOP Dumfriesshire riders Kevin Anderson and Andrew Parker cross the
Border on Saturday in search of winners at Aspatria.
With five meetings to go, Anderson appears to be heading for his sixth
Northern Area men's championship. After the two Easter meetings in
Northumberland he has a lead of seven points over Parker and with five
rides on Saturday, is almost certain to consolidate his position.
With the going likely to be good Anderson is hoping Border Folly will
improve on his third place at Lockerbie and win the confined race, while
Jimmy River, who won the open race at the Dumfriesshire meeting, will be
confidently expected to repeat his success at this meeting last year.
He has obvious chances with Give It Laldy, beaten a head at Lockerbie,
in the open maiden and Bit of A Blether, a convincing 15-length winner
of a maiden at the Buccleuch, in the restricted. Disrespect, pulled up
last time, is given another chance in the open maiden.
Parker, who won by a distance on Staxigoe at the Jedforest meeting,
may lose the ride on this one to Michael Dun, who is returning after
injury. He is more likely partner to Guiting Gray, who has a double
entry for the restricted and the open. Parker may have another mount in
the open maiden race.
The experiment of running the men's and women's opens as one race did
not produce big fields at the Percy meeting last Saturday. With the
ground firm, only four took part in the extended four-mile race. The
winner, Heroic Way, finished lame.
Andrew Parker had a comfortable success on King Spring in the confined
race, while at the Braes of Derwent meeting on Monday Anderson achieved
a double with Miss Enrico in the restricted and Joe's Blackjack in the
maiden.

Celtic 0, Hearts 1
THEY would not have had the cheek to sing in the bus along the M8,
would they? Hearts stole off into the night with the three points which
will surely guarantee their place in the premier division.
Good luck to them. They probably were about due it, but even their
manager admitted they produced ''survival'' football -- not a pretty
sight, but effective.
They had been quite content for most of the night at Hampden to sit
tight and let Celtic do all the serious attacking, but when they got
what was only their second real scoring chance of the evening four
minutes from time they took it willingly.
David Hagen was the man who seized upon a Peter Grant error to beat
the keeper, something Celtic had not been able to do with umpteen
opportunities. Admittedly, they had come up against an inspired keeper
in Craig Nelson, but that was no excuse for what was in the main sloppy
finishing.
Hearts defended stoutly and worked tirelessly, none more so than
veteran Jim Bett, but even they must have been amazed to escape with a
victory. Their few fans in the smallest attendance of the season at a
Celtic home game, 18,638, enjoyed that finale which lifts their team to
40 points, where they would seem certain to be safe.
Celtic manager, Tommy Burns, was deeply disappointed at the result.
''There is no way we deserved to lose. It has got to be very difficult
when both sets of players play in the same half, but that is football.''
His rival, Tommy McLean, was almost apologetic in his remarks.''Our
players worked hard to nullify Celtic, because that's what has to be
done in this league. We have had our say about it in the past and I
believe we are going down the wrong route.''
Hearts were lucky to survive midway through the first half when a
Collins cross was well headed by Phil O'Donnell but, just as it looked
sure to go in at the post, Nelson stretched out a hand and diverted it
away from goal. Willie Falconer hit the rebound, but Jamieson was there
to block the ball and send it for a corner.
Nelson, who had a string of fine saves from Falconer, Walker and
O'Donnell, completed a fine first half with another good stop from the
head of Falconer. A ferocious free kick by Rudi Vata was the next
attempt, but it was parried away for a corner.
Walker then tried an ambitious shot from long range which was easily
collected by the goalie before the striker was replaced by Simon
Donnelly in 66 minutes.
Brian O'Neil, who signed his new three-year contract earlier in the
day, was the only man booked, when he lunged at Hagen during one of the
few Hearts attacks.
The Hearts coup de grace came after a mistake by Grant let Hagen
through. He took a couple of strides and then hit the ball out of
Bonner's reach.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Vata, Boyd, O'Neil, Mowbray, Grant, McLaughlin,
O'Donnell, Falconer, Walker, Collins. Substitutes -- Donnelly, Marshall,
Gray.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Wishart, Miller, Levein, Jamieson, Berry, Hamilton,
Bett, Cramb, Mackay, Hagen. Substitutes -- Colquhoun, Smith, Locke.
Referee -- W Clark (Paisley).

NOBODY could ask for much more than a visit from the country's
champions to hansel their new stand, but Kilmarnock -- whose Chadwick
Stand completes the splendid new Rugby Park -- will have more than
hospitality on their minds when they take on Rangers tonight.
Killie have won their last three games, virtually erased the fear of
relegation and would jump into European contention if they win.
The Ayrshire club and their manager yesterday received warm praise
from the man who has steered his team to their seventh successive title,
Walter Smith. ''They would have been one of the favourites in most
people's minds for relegation at the start of the season,'' he said.
''But it is to their credit and Alex Totten that they have done as
well as they have, at the same time as being one of the few clubs to
have built a new stadium and invested money in players.''
Smith has team problems, and he may end up without a recognised
first-team striker. Mark Hateley suffered a foot injury in the 3-1 win
against Hibs on Sunday and is very doubtful, Gordon Durie is out -- and
Charlie Miller is looking an unlikely starter with a foot knock.
There are other doubts, too, about flu victims Trevor Steven and
Stuart McCall. But Ian Ferguson is likely to start -- and the manager
may consider bringing in youngsters, John Morrow and Lee Robertson.
Totten has a doubt about Colin McKee who suffered a back injury in a
reserve game this week, while John Henry has a throat infection.
However, he will be confident that, whoever plays, the team will be
eager to record their fourth win in a row, which would surely be a
premier division record for the club.
If they do it, they would move on to the 45-point mark, within three
of Motherwell whom they have to meet before the season is over. Hosting
a European tie or two on their new-look ground next season is not yet
out of the question.

Harry Conroy tunes into the popular sounds and images of Scotland as
portrayed by REL Records
RECORD producer Neil Ross, owner of REL Records, does not beat about
the bush when describing the market he is aiming for. It is quite simply
the tartan end.
Many of REL's albums and accompanying videos are snapped up by
American tourists visiting the land of their forefathers.
Last year REL had a big success with their Dancing with the Shands
video, which sold 30,000 copies and is still going strong. The video
included not only footage of Jimmy Shand and his band but also scenic
shots of Scotland.
But despite the record company's tartan image the biggest success in
their 24-year-history did not have a hint of heather. It was the number
one hit single Japanese Boy, sung by Aneka -- alias gaelic singer Mary
Sandeman.
The record only held down the number one spot in the UK record charts
for one week in August 1981 but it was a number one in nine other
countries for a much longer period.
''In this country we were being chased up the charts all the time by
Soft Cell's Tainted Love, and their record company promoted like mad and
pushed us off the UK top spot after only a week,'' laughed Neil Ross,
''but it stayed longer at the top in other countries''.
Mary Sandeman chose the name Aneka from the Edinburgh phone book which
she ploughed through looking for a Japanese sounding name. She came
across Anika and changed the middle vowel to avoid any chance of
upsetting the real owner of the name.
To complete her image change Mary, sorry Aneka, wore a kimono and
Japanese wig while singing her hit on Top of the Pops.
Japanese Boy was written by Bobby Heatlie, and produced by Neil Ross
who licensed its production to Hansa, a large German-based record
company giving them their first British hit.
Neil recalls those heady days well. ''Mary Sandeman was always pushing
to get into pop. She was very keen to have a hit record, and I went down
to London with a demo disc. Although we licensed it to Hansa the record
was very much a Scottish production.''
Despite several attempts there was no follow up hit for Aneka.
''We tried our hardest to follow up Japanese Boy with another hit but
although some of the material we produced later we thought better than
Japanese Boy, they never made it.''
Mary Sandeman however resumed her career as a Scottish folk singer and
REL continues to produce albums of her material.
REL recently released a video by Mary entitled Love Songs of Scotland.
The Scottish record label have 21 videos on the market at the present
time which are produced by Holyrood Recording and Film Productions their
video arm.
''We treat videos as just an extension of CD or a tape,'' explains
Neil Ross, ''the day is fast approaching when people will buy a CD and
it will automatically come packaged with a video.''
The company have just released a video entitled Spirit of Scotland,
and Neil Ross believes that this could become a big success as a spin
off from the showings of the Rob Roy and Brave Heart movies.
''We filmed in the same locations, and our film has, for example,
shots of the grave of Rob Roy, so we believe that many of the people who
go along to these films and admire the scenery will be attracted to our
video as well.''
Neil Ross formed REL in 1971 immediately after leaving Napier College
where he had studied electronics.
Starting up his own studio seemed to be a natural thing to do says
Neil, who comes from a musical family, with his mother Anne being a
classical pianist.
At first, like most studios trying to get off the ground, REL provided
a facility for aspiring young Scottish musicians to make demo tapes. But
now the studio side of REL, when not recording their own artists,
concentrates on dubbing television films post production, and says Neil,
''we are working flat out on this at the moment''.
Among the musicians appearing on the REL label at present are the 120
strong Scottish Fiddle Orchestra and the singing and accordian duo, the
Tartan Lads.
''We are producing a video Prince of Mists to go with the CD cassette
of the orchestra's album,'' says Neil, ''it tells the story of the
Bonnie Prince Charlie's march to Derby and then defeat at Culloden. It
will also include shots of the orchestra's performance at the Royal
Albert Hall.''
REL is now approaching one of their peak times of the year -- the
summer holiday season.
''We have two peak periods,'' Neil adds. ''The Christmas period and
then the tourist season when our type of material is in demand in this
country.''
Looking towards the Christmas market Neil says, ''We will be releasing
a series of five casettes for children which we believe will be popular
but we don't want to say any more about this until nearer the time.''
The company also exports to Germany, North America and Australia, and
are trying to expand in these markets.
At REL's Edinburgh headquarters a number of other small musical
concerns use the hi-tech facilities which says Neil Ross are at the
''cutting edge of technology''.
REL at present employs 12 people, but most evenings you will find a
greater number than this on their premises using various pieces of
equipment rented out by the company.
''There is,'' says Neil Ross ''a lot going on around here''.
' The day is fast approaching when people will buy a CD and it will
automatically come with a video '

SCOTLAND'S 3i investment capital group has bought a 29% stake in water
treatment company Deveron for #300,000, confident that tighter pollution
controls will help its business to expand rapidly.
''We think the business will probably double in size over the next
three years,'' said 3i investment executive Alan Hyslop who negotiated
the deal.
Deveron, which is based in East Kilbride, made a pre-tax profit of
just over #100,000 in the year to March 31 on turnover of about #1.75m.
Mr Hyslop said the company, which designs systems for cleansing water
used by industry and provides the necessary equipment and chemicals,
should see demand for its products soar following the reorganisation of
the Scottish water industry next year.
Water supply in Scotland is currently controlled by regional councils.
But when the newly-elected single-tier local authorities take over in
April next year responsibility will pass to three new regional water
authorities.
Mr Hyslop and Brian Wilson, who helped found Deveron in 1988, said
these new bodies are expected to impose stricter standards of water
cleanliness, forcing many companies to invest more in cleaning up their
effluent discharges.
Lothian Region presently imposes tight restrictions on the discharge
of waste water, but rules in Tayside are more lax, they added.
The charges paid by firms to local authorities for the right to
discharge polluted water used in industrial processes can already be
astronomical and Wilson predicted they would rise further.
''We know of companies that pay #500,000 per year in discharge
costs,'' he said, noting that food and drink-based industries, such as
slaughter houses, breweries and distilleries, were particularly heavily
affected.
Deveron last month launched a new environmentally-friendly water
additive, DELTA PA, which it hailed as a breakthrough in eliminating the
bacteria that causes legionnaire's disease.
But Mr Hyslop said the impact of this new product had not been
factored into 3i's sales forecast for the company, which currently has
only 35 employees.
Deveron director Ramsay Duff said the company was uniquely placed to
help industry cut water pollution since it could design the necessary
equipment as well as providing water treatment chemicals.
''Most of our competitors are either chemical or equipment suppliers
serving either the effluent or water hygiene market. Deveron is the only
company which deals in all areas,'' Duff said.
Mr Hyslop said more than 80% of Deveron's business was in Scotland and
this would remain the main growth area for future business.
''It's still really an emerging business and it has now got to take
advantage of its market position,'' he said.

DUDLEY Wood, secretary of the English Rugby Union, last night
dismissed an MPs' report advocating the withholding of public money from
the 15-a-side game until its ''discrimination'' against rugby league is
ended.
But his Welsh counterpart, Edward Jones, said the planned
redevelopment of the National Stadium in Cardiff could be hit, putting
the country's hosting of the 1999 World Cup in jeopardy.
The report by the National Heritage Committee said restrictions on
rugby league players turning to the rival code were indefensible and
should be scrapped immediately. The committee claimed it was
hypocritical to use the word 'amateur' at a time when rugby union
players were receiving payments in a variety of indirect ways.

MONTROSE went joint second with East Stirling after a fine display

after Neil McAvoy put them ahead in 14 minutes.
McAvoy then turned goal maker after 25 minutes when he crossed for

County's misery was complete when, after 74 minutes, Johnston Bellshaw
put a clearance direct to substitute Shaun Smith, who easily scored.

From PATRICK BROGAN Washington, Wednesday
TODAY'S car bomb blast at a US Government office in Oklahoma City
occurred two years to the day after the government attack on the Branch
Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, that killed 86 people, including about
30 children.
The federal agency responsible for that disaster was the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF). The bureau has an office in the
Alfred Murray federal building which was attacked today.
Other government offices there were the Social Security
Administration, the Secret Service (which deals with currency
counterfeiting as well as protecting public figures), and the Drug
Enforcement Agency.
A number of Branch Davidians who survived the Waco conflagration were
tried and convicted, but others are still free.
Today, however, one survivor of Waco denied involvement by the group
in today's attack.
''In no way are the Branch Davidians connected with the bombing,''
said Clive Doyle. ''The date is the only connection.''
Branch Davidian supporter Ron Engleman, who broke the news of the
Oklahoma City blast to survivors and other supporters at a commemoration
ceremony of the Waco raid, also denied that the group had anything to do
with the blast.
A further group of suspects are Islamic terrorists like the ones who
carried out the World Trade Centre bombing in New York in February,
1993. Another group of Muslims is on trial there now for plotting to
carry out a further series of bombings in the city.
There are hundreds of federal government office buildings in cities
all across the country, thousands if local governments are counted. The
principal government offices here, including the White House and
Congress, are well guarded, but it is quite impossible to protect every
conceivable terrorist target.
This is only the second serious terrorist bombing in the United States
in the past 20 years, after the WTC attack. It may be possible to round
up surviving Branch Davidians, but there are many other fringe and
paranoid groups, and experience abroad, in Northern Ireland, Algeria, or
Egypt, shows how difficult it is to cope with them.

ABERDEEN fans chief Neil McDougall yesterday called on the club to
confirm caretaker Roy Aitken as manager.
For McDougall, chairman of the Dons' supporters association, feels
this would be a positive step foward in the relegation battle.
And he insisted that a decision on the post had to be made swiftly to
safeguard the club's future as 26 players are out of contract at the end
of the season.

WHEN Bernard Frutin, MBE, encounters a problem he invents a solution,
simple as that.
The Renfrew-based entrepreneur is the man who created the ''widget''
which produces a draught-type head on a can of beer. His idea was sold
to a major brewery for an undisclosed sum.
Bernard Frutin also eliminated a DIY enthusiast's nightmare when he
created a pressure pack, allowing the sticky stuff used to seal the gap
between your tiles and bath, to simply flow out instead of congealing in
a messy lump.
Now Mr Frutin, chairman of his ROCEP companies based at Deanpark, is
looking for success in the Renfrewshire Business Awards. The event is
being sponsored by Renfrewshire Enterprise and The Herald, and ROCEP is
competing in several of the seven categories. Not surprisingly, the
Innovation Award is one Mr Frutin has his sights set on, adding
cryptically that he has a number of inventions up his sleeve at the
moment.
He said: ''It can be commercial suicide to disclose information on my
inventions before marketing deals are signed up. We invest heavily on
patent protection, but we must never give the competition too much
information on our next development.
''We will submit our brief in confidence to the judging panel for the
Renfrewshire Business Awards and let them decide on the merits of our
creativity, job creating and export success.''
Bob Swandells, Fruitin's business partner and managing director of the
trading company, ROCEP Pressure Packs, said competing for awards has
long been part of their marketing strategy.
''We realised many years ago that winning prestigious business
excellence awards would be a valuable marketing exercise for our various
activities.
''Credibility is a vital asset in projecting a company and its
products to potential customers and international awards have gained us
great respect and major sales orders,'' he added.
In fact, ROCEP products have recorded an impressive tally of 18
international design and innovation awards and played a part in Bernard
Frutin receiving an MBE for his contribution to British industry.
The invention of the ROCEP Pressure Pack for the DIY market led Mr
Frutin and Mr Swandells to establish a purpose-built manufacturing
facility in what was a disused, run-down warehouse close to Glasgow
airport in 1988.
Now the trading company alone has an annual turnover of #2.5m and
employs 50 people assembling and filling the pressure packs with
clients' products for destinations throughout Europe.
Mr Frutin's other inventions seldom generate less than six-figure sums
when licensed to major companies.
The picture has not always been quite so rosy, though, and both he and
Bob Swandells admit to tough times on the route to the top. ''The worst
part of being an inventor,'' explained Mr Frutin, ''is no-one takes you
seriously for about the first ten years.
''The banks are not in the business of lending high-risk money to take
an idea forward and it can be very frustrating. No wonder so many good
ideas fall by the wayside or end up in Japan or the USA.''
Scotland awaits with interest to see the latest creation from the
master inventor.

THE reality might be nearly impossible to face, but when Aberdeen's
caretaker manager, Roy Aitken, makes defiant noises about his team's
determination to fight relegation until the last whistle has blown this
season, he is not dodging the truth. Aitken, as a player, did not know
defeat until they announced the scoreline on the teatime news. He was
unlikely to change his ways as a gaffer.
He took his team home from Motherwell on Tuesday knowing that the
first demotion from the top league in the club's history is so near as
to be within hurting distance -- but he will not allow rationale to
overtake application at this stage.
''We have three games left,'' he said, ''and they are the most
important this club has ever faced. There is no way we will lie down,
not while I am here.
''Unfortunately, our fate is not in our hands now, but we will be
aiming to take nine points and see what happens. The players are
frustrated and disappointed that they took nothing from Motherwell,
despite another good performance. But their heads won't go down.''
By that, of course, he means that he will not permit such an attitude.
Aitken intends to use the 10-day break between now and the next hurdle,
against Hearts at Tynecastle, to maintain the enthusiasm for the task
that was clearly shown at Fir Park.
He added: ''A lot can still happen because, apart from Rangers, there
is not much between the rest of the teams.
''We face a huge challenge but one which is not beyond us. There is
certainly no defeatist talk in our dressing room.''
Motherwell, who put themselves in the favourites' position for
second-top place in the premier division as a consequence of that defeat
of Aberdeen, will now be expected by manager, Alex McLeish, to give
their fans the same demonstration of passion and style shown against the
Dons for the rest of the season.
McLeish, in his first season as a manager, admits readily to having
made mistakes along the way, but points out that his players have made
their share, too. However, he has no intention of dwelling on the flaws
in either case.
''Hopefully between us we will eradicate these errors as time goes
on,'' he said. ''In the meantime, all I would ask of the players is that
they give the same level of commitment as they did against Aberdeen. If
they do that and we fail to finish second, I would have to hold up my
hands and accept it.''
McLeish had a long discussion with the Fir Park players following
their disappointing shows against Falkirk and Partick Thistle, when they
allowed themselves to lose some of their considerable advantage in the
race for the runners-up place which brings with it automatic UEFA Cup
participation.
He needed only to remind the staff of the great lift they got from
playing in Europe last season when they put up a good show before going
out to Borussia Dortmund -- the German side who were beaten in the
semi-finals this week.
The media interest in that tie gave the Motherwell players a glimpse
of the kind of publicity that can go with the European show but, more
importantly, the realisation that they can compete with the classier
sides on the continent.
Recently, their play seemed to have lost its edge, but the evidence
from Tuesday seems to suggest they are back in good order. They face a
stiff finale against Rangers at Ibrox, Kilmarnock at home and Hearts at
Tynecastle but, when they are in the right mood, they are tough
opponents for anybody.
That has been said often enough about Partick Thistle, but they
stumbled for only the second time in 12 games when they were beaten 3-1
by Dundee United at Firhill.
The strain of maintaining their level of commitment is perhaps
beginning to tell, but manager John Lambie will get the chance to give
his warriors a break until their next task, against Kilmarnock at Rugby
Park on Saturday week.

''WHEN flying long-haul, remove your shoes and put your feet in brown
paper bags. It helps your circulation.
''And if you're having a salad, take the cucumber slices and slap them
on your eyes. It's very soothing.''
This is just one of the many gems contained in US telecommunications
giant AT&amp;T's humorous and well-researched ''Clever Tips for Business
Trips'' publication, which aims to ensure a smooth passage for
high-flying global executives.
The tip comes from a man who should know -- Virgin's Richard Branson.
A host of advice is contained in the pocket-sized book, which is the
work of travel journalist John Law. It ranges from the sublime to the
ridiculous.
Even hardened business travellers who think they've heard it all
before might learn something from Law's humorous but calculating pearls
of wisdom.
''There is a trend in the UK towards soft-sided luggage, presumably
among those unaware that, in a 747 cargo hold, the weight of 30 cases
packed on top of yours is the equivalent of an Indian elephant sitting
on it.
''No wonder, then, that those well-travelled trousers retain their
razor-sharp creases, in all the wrong places,'' Law ironically observes.
More constructive advice on which travel agents to use, how to wangle
preferential treatment from airlines and hotels, car rental, money,
health, and travel insurance is also contained in the booklet.
Not surprisingly, AT&amp;T also uses the opportunity to extol the virtues
of its Calling Card, in removing the hassles of international
communication.
The publication also contains some pieces of advice which will only be
useful in very specific circumstances -- informing readers that it is an
offence to run out of gas on a Californian highway.
Copies of the book, priced #1.50, can be obtained from Mary-Clare
O'Sullivan, marketing manager of AT&amp;T (UK), Norfolk House, 31 St James's
Square, London, on 0171-925-8086.

THE 1957 film Funny Face with Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn, manages
to give a one-sided view of photographer Richard Avedon's work which the
current exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, London,
successfully dispels. The hedonism and glamour of his fashion work for
Harper's Bazaar and Vogue is still there, much of it now swathed in
nostalgia, but it is his documentary work and portraiture which
demonstrate his importance in the history of photography.
The first room sets up an interesting dynamic, perhaps not consciously
intended, between Avedon's photographs of New York and Italy in the
immediate post-war period. The relative affluence in the US is already
revealed as merely a veneer on a society which Avedon would chronicle
being ripped apart from within during the following 50 years.
In his portraits produced in Rome, Venice, and especially Palermo in
the same period, the shocking poverty is counteracted by a joyfulness he
found in his subjects. The striking series depicting the street
performer Zazi in the Piazza Navona in Rome has the energy, movement,
and an appreciation for the less than beautiful which would later make
Avedon's fashion photography so successful and innovative.
The exhibition is organised down a long meandering corridor lined with
portraits of the famous, all with Avedon's characteristic white
background. Small rooms lead off on either side in which groups of works
are organised thematically. Wisely stripped of any of the glamour that
attaches to his portraits, these works are often gritty and grainy in
texture with little sense of the camera as intrusive voyeur.
The series of photographs of residents of a mental hospital in
Louisiana or casualties of napalm attacks in Vietnam, are hard-hitting
social documents. Just as moving is the series of photographs for the
exhibition that Avedon organised in 1985, In the American West, for
which he crossed the country taking portraits of the drifters and
teenage waitresses whom he found in rural America.
The portrait of the cream of American society, the Generals of the
Daughters of the American Revolution taken in 1963, catches the matronly
figures off-guard as they organise to compose their public face. It
breaks all the rules of group photography as the figure in the centre
stands with her back to us and only one woman looks obligingly at the
camera, but there can be few more telling images of late
twentieth-century Western society.
* Richard Avedon: Evidence 1944-94 is at the National Portrait
Gallery, London, to June 11.
* A face of Avedon: one of the portraits on view at the exhibition.

CANNES OPEN
IAN Botham and Ian Woosnam look to be on the way to becoming a double
act. After watching the Welshman at the US Masters a fortnight ago,
Botham has now travelled south to see Woosnam defend the Cannes Open.
''We are similar in our attitudes. He likes a drink, I like a drink,''
said Woosnam on the eve of the #300,000 event. ''I can relax with Ian.
But while he can have a drink this week, I'm working.''
The Jersey-based Ryder Cup player is making a conscious effort to make
that work more pleasurable. ''The last couple of seasons I've not been
enjoying it -- I was practising harder than ever and not really getting
anywhere. Now I'm trying not to take it so seriously.''
He was also trying out a new putting stroke in yesterday's pro-am,
having his left hand below right like Nick Faldo. ''It's not that I've
been putting badly -- it's just that I haven't been holing as many as
I'd like,'' he said.
Woosnam took a break at the start of this year and on his return to
America last month he finished third in the Honda Classic and joint
seventeenth in the US Masters. This is his first appearance of the
season in Europe, but he has a start at Royal Mougins. He has the use of
an apartment at the course, a new Tour venue, and has played it ''about
15 times.''
It was at the nearby Cannes Mougins course that he won last year. He
was 14 behind leader Sam Torrance after 26 holes. He then played the
remaining 46 holes in 20 under par to win by five. Nearest to him was
Colin Montgomerie and the Scot, Europe's No.1 for the last two years and
also seventeenth at Augusta, conceded: ''Woosie is obviously the
favourite here.''
The duo team up in next week's Perrier Pairs event in Paris. Woosnam
said: ''I like Colin's company. He has his problems on the course
sometimes, but I think a lot of people have got him wrong. Next week's
going to be fun.''
As for Botham's presence, Montgomerie joked: ''I will try and stay
away in the evenings.''

DUNDEE United's Scotland midfielder, Billy McKinlay, has made no
secret of the fact that he wants to leave Tannadice. But it is equally
obvious that a piece of his heart will always remain with the club that
gave him his start in football.
That was made plain yesterday as McKinlay examined the plight of his
team. And he predicted that United will fight their way out of the
relegation area before the end of the season.
McKinlay is one of three experienced players who will miss the run-in
to the end of the season. Also out are Brian Welsh and Dave Bowman.
But McKinlay insisted: ''There is no way that United will go down now.
The result we had against Partick Thistle was very important to us.
''When you allied our win to the victory Motherwell had over Aberdeen,
then you realise the importance of that one night's football.''
McKinlay knows that he can only watch helplessly from the stand, but
the contract rebel -- he is taking the club to court to contest the
length of his signing deal -- believes that the change of manager will
bring a change in attitude.
He maintains: ''Billy Kirkwood has had a tremendous impact in the
dressing room already.
''It was not down to him that we did so badly when he first arrived.
It was down to us and basic mistakes that we were making on the field.
''Billy Kirkwood has been working hard on the training ground, and
there is a growing confidence and growing determination.
''The victory brought us to just a point behind Partick, and, then,
with Aberdeen losing, we pulled four points clear of them at the
bottom.''
McKinlay reckons that he and the other two absentees will not be
missed too much between now and the season's end. He said: ''Every team
is losing players at this time of the season, either through suspensions
or injuries.
''It is going to be very hard sitting in the stand knowing that you
can do nothing to help the team.
''But football today is all about squads of players. There is a strong
squad at Tannadice, strong enough to take the team away from trouble.
''We have to be ready for the next game against Hibs, and then for the
game against Aberdeen -- but I cannot see them being able to beat us.''
Now manager Billy Kirkwood will have to rethink his strategy for the
remaining three games. Moving Brian Welsh to centre-forward paid off at
Firhill -- now Welsh will be missing.
But Kirkwood, smiling after the Firhill win, possibly for the first
time since he took over the problems of United, said: ''There is no
point in dwelling on the fact that we will be missing the players.
''There is nothing we can do about it. The suspensions are there, the
players cannot play, and so we have to change.
''The heartening thing at Firhill was that the players fought for the
result.
''We deserved to win and that was one of the toughest games we could
be asked to face at this stage of the season with relegation still so
finely balanced.''

GREATER GREENSBORO OPEN
ALTHOUGH the world's three top-ranked golfers are on holiday, there
will be no shortage of talent at the $1.5m Kmart Greater Greensboro Open
starting here today.
Davis Love, the Masters runner-up, heads a strong 156-man field that
includes 14 of the leading 20 players on the US PGA Tour's 1995 money
list.
Love won on the demanding Forest Oaks course three years ago when he
blew away the field with a closing 62 to finish on 16-under-par 272,
just one shot shy of Sandy Lyle's course record.
After a lean spell last year, the long-hitting American is nearly back
to his best and will start one of the favourites.
He will have plenty of competition, however, from the likes of dual
1995 winner Peter Jacobsen and US Players' Championship winner Lee
Janzen.
Love, Jacobsen and Janzen are currently the three top players on the
US Tour's 1995 money list, while Nick Price, Greg Norman, and Nick Faldo
head the Sony world rankings.
Price, however, is having the week off to move into a new house near
Norman on Jupiter Island, Florida, while Norman and Faldo are taking
extended breaks -- six weeks for Norman and three for Faldo.
In Faldo's absence, Ulsterman David Feherty and Swede Jepser Parnevik
are the only Europeans playing. British Open runner-up Parnevik hopes to
bounce back after a disappointing finish at last week's Heritage
Classic, where he was on the leaderboard early in the third round before
fading to finish equal forty-fourth.
Feherty's disappointing form continued at the Heritage as he missed
the cut.
Mike Springer is the defending Greensboro champion, but he has been in
poor form this year, missing the cut in seven of 10 tournaments, and is
not among the favourites.

CRICKET
THOSE looking for surprises in the Scotland side for next week's
Benson and Hedges Cup ties against Worcestershire and Derbyshire were
left disappointed yesterday.
Likewise, those attempting to track down the Scots' hired hand for
this term's qualifying games, Malcolm Marshall, were also left looking.
Marshall was AWOL yesterday, with everyone from the Scottish Cricket
Union to Hampshire -- whom he is coaching this term -- on the hunt for
the former West Indian Test star.
Indeed, one request to Hampshire concerning his whereabouts received
the reply along the lines that if you find him, can you tell him we're
also looking for him.
Marshall is due to play for Cheshire side Denton in the Lancashire
County League on Saturday and they, too, have still to hear from him.
However, Marshall's agent, Denis Bundy, attempted to put everyone at
ease last night.
''I've been dealing with Malcolm for five years and if he says he'll
be at a certain place at a certain time, he'll be there,'' he said.
''He is a typical Barbadian. He appears laid back and without a care,
but he is ready for this new challenge and is really looking forward to
it.''
Bundy added: ''He led Natal to the Castle Cup in South Africa during
the winter and has a real appitite for the game just now.
''Jim Love and the Scots lads don't have to worry, he'll be there on
Sunday.''
SCU executive Alex Ritchie was not in too much of a panic either
concerning Marshall.
''He is about,'' assured Ritchie. ''I don't think there is anything to
worry about. I spoke to his agent last week and everything was okay.
Marshall is named in the 13-man squad which, as expected, does not
include Bruce Patterson, omitted after failing to take part in the
weekend training trip to the north of England.
Hard-hitting West Lothian opener Steve Crawley is included, despite
drawing a blank against Durham, while David Cowan is listed, though he
is still feeling a knee injury. Squad:
J D Love (Heriot's), captain, D Cowan (Freuchie), S T Crawley (West
Lothian), J W Govan (Carlton), D J Haggo (Ayrshire), G B J McGurk
(Grange), G N Reifer (Uddingston), M J Smith (Aberdeenshire), I M
Stanger (Clydesdale), A C Storie (West of Scotland), K Thomson
(Strathmore), P Steindl (unattached), M D Marshall.
FRIENDLIES
Lancashire 245 for four decl (N J Speak 116, J P Crawley 74) and 44-1,

SCOTLAND'S women bowlers picked up a couple of useful victories over
the USA in the second round of the Perm Atlantic Rim championships at
Durban yesterday.
But they were set back on their heels after lunch when Argentina
turned on the style to beat the world champions in the pairs and
triples.
Although Sarah Gourlay, who has hurt her bowling hand, was still not
fit to take her place in the Scottish triple, it would be unfair to put
the double defeat down to her absence.
''Quite simply, the Argentinians were brilliant,'' said Scottish team
manager Eleanor Allan, who again played second in the triple. ''We came
back well and were holding two shots for a tie on the last end when
Susana de Cantarini played a stunner.''
De Cantarini, indeed, was the star of the show, but she had good
support from Susana de Martinez and Graciela de Edwards as the
Argentinians built up a 17-11 lead by the thirteenth end.
A double and a superb 6 count took the Scots briefly into the lead at
19-17, but they failed to score again as the Argentinians claimed a
22-19 victory.
Betty Forsyth and Frances Whyte scored a 6 against the Argentinian
pair, but apart from that, they were never really in the match as
Beatriz de Bausili and Angela de Abelle cruised to a 22-16 win.
Earlier, the Scottish pair had beaten the USA's Heather Stewart and
Anne Barber, 16-13, while Janice Maxwell's triple claimed a 19-12
victory over Myra Wood's American trio. Results:
Pairs: M Bosman and A Ainsworth (Namibia) beat G Fitzgerald and N Shaw
(England) 26-9; M Le Marquand and S Syvret (Jersey) beat S Jack and J
Taylor (Spain) 27-11; C Scop and R Kusman (Israel) beat J Simon and B Le
Cras (Guernsey) 21-16; L Trigwell and J Peacock (S Africa) beat A de
Abelle and G de Merli (Argentina) 23-15; J Ackland and B Morgan (Wales)
beat B Cameron and P Nolan (Ireland) 22-20; B Forsyth and F Whyte
(Scotland) beat H Stewart and A Barber (USA) 16-13.
Triples: Namibia beat England, 21-7; Jersey beat Spain, 21-11; Israel
beat Guernsey, 28-13; South Africa beat Argentina, 35-12; Ireland beat
Wales, 22-21; Scotland beat USA, 19-12.
* RICHARD Corsie, fresh from an indoor bowls campaign in which he
claimed the world pairs title with Alex Marshall and finished runner-up
to Andy Thomson in the world singles, launches his outdoor campaign on
the Gold Coast today in the Mazda Tweed Classic.
The three-day classic is a new event to the international calendar and
will act as a curtain-raiser for next week's Mazda International Jack
High in Sydney.
The Jack High event moves to the Harbord Diggers' Memorial club in
Manly after having been staged on the Gold Coast for the past three
years, but the management of the Tweed Heads club were so keen to
maintain contact with the event that they have introduced the Mazda
Tweed Classic.

NOW here is something really different. A number of strands have come
together which have resulted in the Eastwood Festival commissioning a
new work. But this is no ordinary concert hall-type commission. Scottish
composer Nicky Hind, now working at Stanford University in California,
was fascinated by outdoor concerts of computer music on the west coast
of the States.
Meanwhile, festival co-ordinator Michael Dale had discovered the
gorgeous Greenbank Gardens, owned by the National Trust, and was
wondering how to feature them in the festival. Various other bodies, not
least the Scottish Arts Council, entered the proceedings, and the result
-- after four months flat-out work in the States by Hind, is a sonic
installation in the gardens.
The way it works is this: in four of the gardens, there are stacks of
speakers. Each transmits continuously a different tape of electronically
generated sounds. As you stand and listen to one, you can hear some of
the others in the distance. And as you move from one garden to the next,
perspectives change as the sounds overlap and fade.
Begin at the garden marked Slumber, and feel a gentle hypnotic
pulsing, like a heartbeat. Move into the garden marked First Steps, and
hear tentative steps towards rhythm and melody. In Quest, the music --
throbbing and pulsing, almost choral -- becomes more directional. And
the final garden, Confluence, the sound, built around the fountain, is
like a chattering dawn chorus.
The tapes, each running for about 20 minutes, all develop. Pick your
moment and perambulate to the progression. Do the gardens in reverse
order and hear the fade into Slumber. Intriguing and fascinating. Runs
till Sunday, from noon each day.

CHELSEA v REAL ZARAGOZA
CHELSEA go for broke against Real Zaragoza tonight, knowing their
desperation for an early goal could quickly prove fatal.
Glenn Hoddle's side trail 3-0 in their Cup-Winners' Cup semi-final, a
deficit which history proves can be overcome, especially against such a
volatile side as the Spaniards.
But the commitment to attack will leave them open to concede an away
goal which would end their hopes. And in Juan Eduardo Esnaider, they
face a striker already rated as one of the best in the world who showed
his class with two goals in the first leg.
Defender Frank Sinclair will again have the job of trying to shackle
the young Argentinian and he admitted: ''He is a very, very good player
and it is easy to see why he is being compared with the very best.
''We've got to be tight on the ball and release it forward as quickly
as possible to try and get at least one early goal. We'll have a real go
at them and see what happens.''
Chelsea's best European comeback was in 1971 when they lost 2-0 in
Bruges but won the return 4-0 and went on to beat Real Madrid in the
Cup-Winners' Cup final.
Victor Fernandez's side have a lot of class, but don't travel well,
having lost to 2-1 to Gloria Bistrita in the first round and 1-0 to
Feyenoord in Rotterdam in the quarter-final first leg.
They also have Uruguayan Gustavo Poyet and Javier Aguado suspended.
But they have conceded just 34 goals in 29 League games and Fernandez
said: ''It will be very difficult for Chelsea -- especially as I'm sure
we will score a few.''
His bigger worry is that seven of his squad are one booking away from
a ban.
Chelsea have their own selection problems, with goalkeeper Dmitri
Kharine, skipper Dennis Wise and defender Jakob Kjeldbjerg ruled out.
Hoddle rates himself as having a 50-50 chance of playing -- the same
odds as defenders Scott Minto and Andy Myers and midfielder Eddie
Newton.

A breakfast-time relapse in sterling to fresh lows against the German
mark and a basket of international currencies underlined the message of
last month's meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George.
Minutes of the March 8 monetary meeting, at which it was decided to
leave base rates unchanged at 6.75%, showed that the two men had a frank
a discussion about the policy implications of the pound's weakness and
heightened fears that rates would be raised after the meeting on May 5.
The Governor warned the Mr Clarke that ''while it would be premature
to react with any policy move at this stage, if the disturbance became
more intense we could find that we would need to consider our own
stance.'' He also spoke of the possibility that he might need to revert
to the Chancellor if the situation were to deteriorate.
Mr Clarke was concerned that the fall in sterling had effectively
loosened monetary policy and agreed that developments in the exchange
markets would have to be kept under review.
In fact the pound's decline has continued unabated since then though
the two men also stayed their hands on interest rates at their meeting
on April 5.
Early yesterday the pound posted an all-time low of DM2.1790 on the
back of the dollar dropping below 80 yen for the first time ever.
Later sterling hit a fresh low of 83.6 on its trade-weighted index.
The previous low was 84.0 in February 1993. At its worst point yesterday
the pound had lost 5.5% of its international value so far this year.
Back on March 8 when the Chancellor and the Governor were toying with
the possibility of having to raise rates to compensate for sterling's
weakness the loss since the start of the year was 2.3%.
Rule-of-thumb calculations suggest that a 4% fall in sterling is
equivalent to a 1% reduction in interest rates. Effectively monetary
policy is looser now than it was when interest rates were last raised in
February.
The fear is that the drop in sterling will add to the inflationary
pressures building up within the economy. Creeping devaluation will
boost manufacturing and heighten capacity restraints emerging in some
industrial sectors.
Both the pound and the dollar staged partial recoveries from early
lows. The British currency ended European trading 1.53 pfennigs down at
DM2.1874, and its gain against the dollar was confined to 0.21 cents at
1.6160.
The trade-weighted index also recovered for a loss of 0.2 to 83.9, the
first time it had ever closed below 84.0.
Sterling's decline is largely a function of the weak dollar which has
lost 20% of its value against the yen this year. At the root of the
problem is the huge US trade deficit, at its most acute in transactions
with Japan.
The US authorities appear to be turning a blind eye to the dollar's
collapse and are impervious to international pressure to take action to
reduce the country's yawning budget deficit being financed by
international borrowing, much of it in yen.
The pound has been caught in the crossfire between the dollar and the
German mark, which has made giant strides as a safe-haven currency in
times of turmoil on the markets.
Above $1.60 sterling has run into resistance, exaggerating its
weakness against the mark and other Continental currencies. The pound
has little going for it, especially in the light of the constant
reminders of the Government's political problems.
The likely scale of the Conservatives' local election losses in
England and Wales on May 4 and their effect on John Major's chances of
surviving as Prime Minister are already exercising the foreign exchange
markets.
When the Governor and the Chancellor meet on the morning after
sterling could well be back in the doghouse. A bank holiday on the
Monday to celebrate VE-day is likely to intensify pressure on the
authorities to raise rates without delay. Paris and London apart, most
major currency centres are open for business on May 8.
Both gilts and equities were in little doubt that higher interest
rates were on their way after the Treasury published the March 8
minutes. The FTSE-100 share index fell 24.4 points to 3170.1.

Stirling County 18, Biggar 14
IT HAS been a fine season already for Stirling County, but last night
they made sure it would be a vintage one after their youth team had won
the SRU Youth Trophy final at Meggetland, writes Alan Lorimer.
The SRU, having made the decision to introduce a senior cup next
season, were given confirmation of the value of this kind of competition
last night in a match contested by two teams committed to positive
rugby. In the end it was Stirling County's slight advantage in their
forwards and the powerful kicking of centre Alan Sievewright that made
the difference.
It looked as though Stirling would be easy winners when two minutes
into the second half they led 18-0 through a couple of tries from their
rumbustious hooker, Andy Neilson, and the conversion, a penalty goal and
a drop goal by Sievewright.
Biggar, last season's cup winners, however, staged a late revival with
a try by captain Fraser Campbell, who ploughed through the defence after
flanker Mike Scott had posted the prop a perfect pass.
Full back Murray Thomson converted and six minutes before full time
Biggar put themselves into a potentially winning position when lock
forward Russell Hodge scored his side's second try, Thomson converting.
But try as they did, Biggar could not add to their total.
Stirling County -- E Smith (captain); M Taylor, D Senior, A
Sievewright, D Ogsdon; S McAllister, F Kennedy; G Harvey, A Neilson, J
Smith, C Malcolm, C Rae, A Pollock, E McCulloch, E Duncan. Replacements
-- M Brett (for Malcolm).
Biggar -- M Thomson; M McKenzie, A Hunter, A Browning, D Cairns; J
McLelland, S Armstrong; G Tweedie, S Crone, F Campbell (captain), S
Coubrough, R Hodge, S Scott, A Cairns, A Russell.
Referee -- J Fleming (Boroughmuir).

CAIRN Energy said yesterday it had agreed to buy a controlling stake
in the Dutch gas exploration and production company Holland Sea Search
Holding (HSSH), to secure long-term gas production in the North Sea and
boost its gas exploration activities in Bangladesh.
Cairn, flush with cash after selling off most of its US assets last
year, said it had agreed to buy 55.4 million shares in HSSH from the
Netherlands' Command Petroleum at 0.35 guilders per share.
The Edinburgh-based company said it had also arranged to buy a further
6.4 million HSSH shares from ABN AMRO bank, bringing its total stake in
the Dutch gas company to 50.68%.
''We effectively get control of 50.68% of the concern, effective
today,'' said Cairn chief executive Bill Gammell.
HSSH produced 16.07 million cubic feet of gas per day in March, the
equivalent of 2678 barrels of oil.
Cairn's offer values the firm at 42.7m guilders (#17.3m), slightly
less than its present capitalisation of about 44.0m guilders (#17.8m) on
Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
Mr Gammell said the takeover was not subject to any government
regulation in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, Cairn would offer to buy
HSSH's remaining shares at 0.35 guilders per share or offer 4.35
guilders and two Cairn shares for every 25 shares in the company, he
added.
The chief executive said Cairn would finance the purchase of HSSH with
a #10.8m cash surplus, achieved at the end of 1994 after running down
its stake in Cairn Energy USA from 60.5% to 17.5%, and with up to #10m
of loans arranged by the Bank of Scotland.
Cairn remained on the lookout for further acquisitions to boost its
oil and gas production, which totalled the equivalent of 3400 barrels of
oil per day prior to the HSSH purchase, he added.
Mr Gammell said Cairn might help finance further expansion by selling
off its remaining US assets, valued at around #15m.
It could also raise cash by selling HSSH's 50% stake in a Russian
joint venture set up to develop oilfields in the Volga-Urals basin, he
added, noting that this could yield a further $4m to $7.5m (#2.5m to
#4.7m).
''We are not interested in Russia,'' Mr Gammell said, stressing that
Cairn was mainly attracted by HSSH's North Sea gas production and its
gas exploration activities in Bangladesh, where the two companies are
already partners.
''We are attracted to the long life gas production in Holland, but we
are also interested in adding to our Bangladesh position,'' he said.
The company is currently processing the results of a seismic survey in
Bangladesh, where last year it became the first western company to sign
a gas production sharing contract.
Cairn and HSSH are partners in offshore block 16, where Cairn holds a
75% stake and HSSH the remaining 25%. The two firms have also reached
preliminary agreement to jointly exploit block 15.
Mr Gammell said Cairn hoped to begin drilling its first exploration
wells in Bangladesh at the end of this year or early 1996 and start gas
production there within two or three years.
''There has been an extraordinarily good one-in-two success rate in
drilling in Bangladesh so we are fairly confident that we are going to
find some gas,'' he said.
Cairn's present output consists mainly of oil lifted from onshore
wells in southern England and offshore wells in the North Sea. It also
gets three million cubic feet of gas per day, equivalent to 500 barrels
of oil, from a field in southern Spain.
Shares in Cairn closed up 1p at 74p.

DUNDEE'S 19-year-old striker Jim Hamilton was yesterday named as a
late addition to the Scotland under-21 squad for next week's match with
San Marino, but his call-up for first international duty was no
afterthought by the SFA.
Craig Brown had been unable to confirm Hamilton's place when he named
the rest of the pool, because Dundee were only able to furnish proof of
the player's age yesterday.
Dens Park manager Jim Duffy said: ''We were asked earlier to supply a
copy of Jim's birth certificate, but it was at his family home in
Peterhead and we couldn't get hold of it.''
Hamilton scored 11 goals in Dundee's promotion push this season,
including a hat trick against Hamilton last Saturday.
* WORLD soccer's governing body FIFA announced yesterday that it is to
investigate allegations of attempted bribery of players at the World
Youth Championships in Doha, Qatar.
In a statement from its Zurich headquarters, FIFA said there was no
proof as yet that any match had been influenced.
But a betting syndicate at the centre of a massive bribery scandal in
Malaysia is believed to have tried to fix match results by either
offering money to players or blackmailing them with photographs of
prostitutes.
* HIBS defender Stuart McCaffrey has been pulled out of the Scotland
squad for the Youth Championship finals in Belgium.
McCaffrey has a fractured ankle and coach Ross Mathie yesterday pulled
in his Easter Road team-mate Paul Cook.
The Scots leave this weekend and will meet England, Portugal, and
Slovakia in their open section games.
* RANGERS' season ticket holders will have to pay more to see the
champions in action at Ibrox next season.
The club have announced a 5% rise in the price of season tickets which
will add another #8m pouring into Ibrox in the next two months.
* BRIAN Laudrup, of Rangers, Manchester United goalkeeper Peter
Schmeichel, and Ipswich's Claus Thomsen have been named in Denmark's
squad to play Macedonia in a European Championship qualifier in

SCOTTISH No.1 Michele Mair had to work hard to earn her place in the
second round of the Scottish Reebok tour indoor event at Craiglockhart,
where she beat English opponent Jasmine Choudhury, 6-4, 6-1.
The Colinton player, seeded sixth, broke her opponent's serve in the
opening game, but Choudhury broke back immediately and led 4-3 in the
first set before Mair moved up a gear and was well in control in the
second set.
Tayport's Nicola Payne, who came through the qualifying rounds, also
won her first-round match, beating Kent's Tracey King 6-4, 6-4, while
Murrayfield's Lyndsay Reilly went out to Sarah Bentley 6-1, 6-2.
Scottish men's No.1 Ross Matheson, a late entry, plays his first match
in the tournament against Gregg Saffrey (Bracknell). Results:

* THOMAS Enqvist moved a step closer to his third ATP title of the
year yesterday, easing into the quarter-finals of the Hong Kong Open.
The 21-year-old Swede, who beat Andre Agassi and Michael Chang on his
way to victory in Philadelphia in February, scored a 6-7, 6-1, 6-4 win
over Germany's David Prinosil.
''I cannot compare myself with Chang and Agassi -- they deserve the

tennis I can beat the top players.''
Enqvist, who also won in Auckland in January, will meet fellow Swede
Jonas Bjorkman -- who beat Greg Rusedski 7-5, 6-4 -- in the next round.
Top seed and defending champion Chang had his match with Alex
Radulescua postponed until today because of rain.
* BRITAIN'S women, beaten 2-1 by Slovenia in their opening Fed Cup

yesterday. Their survival hopes in group A rest on today's match against
Poland.

YOU have got to admire Misty Oldland's style. As part of the deal to
entertain Glasgow's hippest audience tonight at The Herald/Armani
evening at Tramway, she was taken to the fashion house's London store to
be kitted out.
Staff reportedly freaked when, from a standing start, she unerringly
chose the only thing in the shop worth #7000. So if you fancy that
be-sequinned jacket ''cut long like a man's'', that's how far the
plastic is going to have to stretch.
''It's humorous and funky, and still Armani,'' Oldland explains -- and
she should know. In a former life the was a catwalk model herself,
notably for Hamnett; but a career as a clotheshorse was not for her.
''I have a lot of respect for the fashion business, but it was never
really my bag. I was creatively frustrated.''
And that -- as her record company, Columbia, has found out -- is
frustration which Oldland will not put up with. Let's not go bandying
around Madonna comparisons and expression like ''control freak'', but
Misty Oldland is -- on the back of 150,000 copies sold of her debut
album Supernatural -- making music very much on her own terms.
The one-off Glasgow gig interrupts the recording schedule for the
follow-up, Revolution, which was delivered to the record company as a
12-page printed proposal before work on it even began.
''These are my melodies, my lyrics and my stories,'' says Oldland,
''so I wanted creative control.''
With the singles Got Me A Feeling, the witty A Fair Affair, and Wrote
You A Song being hits from France to Japan, even when they failed to
climb to the top in the UK, Columbia were looking at more obvious routes
to capitalise on their signing.
''There was talk of working with Narada Michael Walden, but to churn
out something off the factory line was not what I wanted to do. I don't
want to start going for desperate formulas to have a hit. It's not that
I'm not into collaborating, but I'm the boss, and being a woman blah
blah blah . . .''
Being a woman, it must help to have a female publisher and -- still
most unusually in the UK record industry -- a female A&amp;R person (the
crucial liaison link) at the record company; but it is still an
achievement to be given complete production control. From booking the
musicians, through organising the schedule for the day, to ordering the
tape, Oldland is calling the shots.
''Obviously there has been some concern in the record company about
that,'' she admits.
Unlike the debut album, she is playing some of her own keyboard parts
on the new recording. Her Swiss mother, a keen amateur classical
musician, encouraged her daughter in her own instruments -- cello and
piano. The soul music influence came from her father, and the impetus to
write songs -- she wrote her first at 11 -- from Elton John.
Oldland, who will be accompanied by a trio in the classic jazz sense
tonight, is modest about her own playing abilities.''I am naive
technically, but there is a feel that people like,'' she says.
With about three weeks left to complete on the album, three months
work behind her, and I-level's Joe Dworvoniak (who worked on
Supernatural) on board for the closing stages, Oldland is confident
she's made the record she wanted to make, and Glasgow will get an early
taste of it before a summertime Oldland blitz begins.
A friendship with Terence Trent D'Arby, forged on a French TV show,
has led to a likely guest slot on his July tour, with Oldland's own
dates around the same time, including a projected four in Scotland.
There are also a number of appearances on the summer festival circuit,
including the second T ''In The Park'' at Strathclyde Park.
All of which leaves no time at all for her skills at running a club.
Her Leicester Square dance emporium Slow Motion was listed among the top
10 in England, and was famous -- as its name suggests -- for its strict
policy of not permitting DJs to play anything that clocked in over 100
beats per minute.
That refreshing change in an era of E-fuelled house frenzy was
strictly enforced. Platter-spinners who broke the rule were issued with
speeding tickets. You have got to admire Oldland's style.

Sheffield
JIMMY White will continue his quest to win the Embassy World Snooker
Championship for the first time in a turbulent career after the sport's
governing body eliminated him from their inquiries into alleged match
rigging.
The 32-year-old Londoner and South African Peter Francisco were
summoned to a World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association
inquiry in Sheffield yesterday.
The inquiry took evidence and deliberated for six hours on the eighth
floor of the city's Grosvenor Hotel before White, who had spent much of
the time pacing the foyer, was told he could go, but the inquiry is to
continue with Francisco.
''I am delighted to have been vindicated and I am delighted my fellow
professionals supported me fully,'' said White, who never doubted it
would end this way for him, although he never expected the inquiry to
last so long.
''I have been eliminated from their inquiries and that was the biggest
odds-on at these championships,'' White said.
''This has cost me a day's practice and I'm leaving to go and do that
now. I have to say it was not nice having something like this hanging
over me, but the game is too big and too clean for anything crooked to
have been happening.
''It's not my place to comment on anything else, but there is no way I
would ever throw a match.''
The inquiry panel of Geoff Foulds, Bill Oliver, and Mike Waterson
heard evidence from WPBSA chairman, former world champion John Spencer,
who had watched the entire first-round match after he had been alerted
by the Betting Offices Licencees Association. They suggested ''unusual
betting patterns'' with about #60,000 worth of bets placed on White to
win 10-2. When that was the outcome, Spencer and his people moved
quickly.
''We want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible,'' said
Spencer, who seemed oblivious to the fact that their inquiry had lasted
six hours.
This is the second time snooker has been shaken by allegations of
malpractice. In 1989, Terry Griffiths and Silvino Francisco, who is
Peter's uncle, were questioned by the fraud squad after the Welshman's
5-1 victory in a Benson and Hedges match. Both players were subsequently
cleared.
The punishment for anyone found guilty of match rigging is a life ban
from the sport, but that was never likely to happen to White, who now
meets David Roe on Saturday.
Malcolm Hulley, secretary of the WPBSA, said in a statement: ''The
disciplinary committee inquiry was established to see if there had been
a breach of the association's rules in the match between Jimmy White and
Peter Francisco. The inquiry accepted a submission that there was no
case to answer against Jimmy White and in view of the late hour will
continue the inquiry in respect of Peter Francisco.''
A date for this remaining part of the inquiry will be announced today,
he added.
Snooker's official bookmakers William Hill said they will withhold
payment of bets placed on the correct frame-score of the match until the
inquiry is complete, but all bets for Jimmy to win the match will be
paid out.

Turnhout, Wednesday
A BRITISH former church minister must stand trial before a Belgian
jury to answer accusations he published international guides for child
molesters, a court ruled today.
Charges were brought against John Stamford by four children's rights
groups, who allege that Stamford provided information on child
prostitutes to thousands of pedophiles around the world.
According to the prosecution, Stamford used a homosexual travel guide
called Spartacus as a front for a mailing service offering information
on child prostitution in Thailand, Brazil, the Philippines, and other
nations.
Stamford first went on trial in this northern town last November,
charged with offending public morals and publicising sexual
exploitation.
The local court ruled today that it was not competent to pass sentence
and said Stamford will have to stand before a jury at a higher court in
the city of Antwerp, probably in the autumn.
Bernard Boeton of Terre des Hommes (Land of Mankind), one of the
rights groups involved in the case, welcomed the ruling since the higher
court will have power to hand down a longer sentence.
''We want to make an example here, because tens of thousands of
children are victims of prostitution around the world,'' he said.--AP.

From EUGENE MOOSA Tokyo, Wednesday
THE number two man in a doomsday cult linked to last month's lethal
gas attack on the Tokyo subway was arrested today.
A police spokesman identified the man as Kiyohide Hayakawa, 45, and
described him as deputy leader of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth)
sect.
He was detained on charges involving a break-in at a garage where a
car was found containing materials used for making guns. The charges did
not directly link Hayakawa either to the Tokyo subway attack or to a gas
attack today in Japan's second biggest city, Yokohama.
Hayakawa, the so-called ''Russian Connection'' in the sect's efforts
to buy weapons from illegal groups in the former Soviet Union, was
second only to cult founder Shoko Asahara in its hierachy.
Asahara has so far eluded a huge manhunt.
Hayakawa was described as the group's ''construction minister'' in
documents seized by police in a series of raids since the March 20 Tokyo
sarin nerve gas attack in which 12 people died and 5500 were injured.
The arrest was announced hours after today's gas attack on Japan's
railway system in Yokohama, near Tokyo.
Hayakawa was arrested after an appearance on a live television
interview filmed at the sect's headquarters in a village at the foot of
Mount Fuji.
Raids over the past month on the headquarter complex have revealed
tonnes of lethal chemicals, including sarin.
Japanese media reports have alleged that Hayakawa was the middleman in
what they called the cult's efforts to arm itself with guns and tanks
through ''Russian Connections''.
The reports said Hayakawa visited Russia several times to explore
weapons purchases.
He was the key negotiator in the sect's purchase of a Russian
helicopter last June for 78 million yen (#633,000).
More than 100 AUM followers have been arrested so far on various
charges including abduction, illegal confinement, and traffic offences.
Last week, Russian president Boris Yeltsin ordered a full
investigation into the activities of the sect, which says it has 30,000
members in Russia.
A Moscow court has frozen the sect's bank assets and ordered its
property confiscated.
Today, however, the Russian branch said the court ban could not stop
its work.
''Taking away our judicial status does not stop our religious
activity,'' said spokeswoman Tatyana Nirikova.
A lawyer for the branch told a news conference that yesterday's Moscow
court ruling removing its legal status was unjust. He denied the cult
had any link with the March 20 attack in the Tokyo subway or today's
attack in Yokohama.--Reuter.

From TIM BROWN Madrid, Wednesday
SPAIN'S conservative Leader of the Opposition, Jose Maria Aznar,
survived a Basque terrorist car bomb assassination attempt in Madrid
today.
Police said that the armour-plated car in which he was riding saved
the 42-year-old leader of the Popular Party, who is clear favourite to
win the next General Election in Spain.
Basque Eta terrorists detonated the 55lb bomb by remote control as the
politician's car was taking him to party headquarters from his home.
The vehicle took the full force of the blast, but his security back-up
men in two following cars were amazed to see the conservative leader
step from the wreckage with only a slight cut on his head.
He walked to a hospital near the scene of the blast in a suburban
street. Sixteen other people were injured.
Later Mr Aznar was taken to another hospital for a medical check.
Doctors said that his general condition was good.
The blast brought down a wall of a two-storey building, showering
debris over a 69-year-old woman who suffered a near-fatal heart attack
and was later in critical condition.
Other parked cars were set ablaze and windows shattered in many nearby
houses.
''It was like a ball of fire coming at us,'' said one of the police
body guards in an escort car behind.
Three terrorists escaped in a stolen car with false plates which they
later blew up on waste land.
After visiting Mr Aznar, the party's general secretary, Francisco
Alvarez Casco, said: ''If Eta is trying to terrorise the Popular Party,
it has failed.''
The murder attempt came three months after Eta shot dead the party's
regional leader in the Basque country, Gregorio Ordonez, who was
favourite to become mayor of San Sebastian after next month's municipal
elections.
Eleven Basque car bomb attacks in Madrid in four years have killed 16
and injured 89.
All political parties were united in condemning the attack as an
attempt by Eta to wreck democracy.

From CHARLES MILLER Sarajevo, Wednesday
THREE British soldiers were injured, one seriously, after they walked
into a minefield in the eastern Bosnian safe area of Gorazde today.
The men, part of 270-strong force from the Royal Welch Fusiliers based
in the embattled enclave, were on a routine foot patrol.
The first soldier walked into the minefield, whose existence was
known, and a boobytrapped mine exploded, causing serious injuries to his
face.
As the two other men rushed to his aid, they stepped on more mines and
suffered injuries to their lower legs.
Bosnian army troops nearby heard the explosions and dashed to the
scene to give first-aid.
Bosnian Serb commanders immediately granted the necessary clearances
for a United Nations helicopter to land.
The injured men were then flown to the Nordic UN base in Tuzla where
there are good medical facilities.
UN peacekeeping force spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward
described the condition of the first soldier as ''serious''.
He added, however, that it was hoped that the legs of the other two
men could be saved.
The Royal Welch Fusiliers, based at Brawdy, Pembrokeshire, began
operations in Gorazde last month.
They have come under fire several times in recent weeks from Bosnian
Serb and Bosnian forces in the area.
The latest injuries brings the total number of British troops injured
in Bosnia since operations began in November, 1992, to around 40.
In a related development, the UN said today that either Bosnian Serb
or government forces could have shot one of two French soldiers killed
by sniper fire in Sarajevo on Friday, but added that evidence pointed
strongly to the latter.

guilty of spying for the United States and their case would be reviewed
by Iran's supreme court.
The head of Iran's supreme court, Ayatollah Mohammad Mohammadi Gilani,
described the three unnamed Americans as ''mercenary agents who spied
for America and its accomplices during the (1980-88 Iran-Iraq) war.''
Only one American, a businessman from Texas, is known to be held in
Iran. Milton Meyer, 58, was arrested in 1992 and accused of economic
spying.

Tripoli, Wednesday
TWO airliners with Libyan pilgrims aboard left today for the Muslim
haj in Saudi Arabia as the United Nations gave the go-ahead for the
pilgrimage flights to leave Libya.
Hundreds of Libyans at Tripoli airport applauded at the departure of
the Libyan Arab Airlines Boeing 727, taking 150 pilgrims from Libya and
black African countries.
The take-off was shown live on Libyan television and the Libyan Jana
news agency said a second flight had taken off from the eastern city of
Benghazi.
The start of direct flights from Libya to Saudi Arabia demonstrated
the brinkmanship tactics of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to get the
United Nations to lift its 1992 flight ban imposed for the Lockerbie
bombing.
The United Nations had banned flights as part of sanctions imposed
over the 1988 bombing, which killed 270 people.
Since the ban on air traffic took effect in April 1992, Libyans have
been able to travel abroad only by sea or land, mainly through
neighbouring Egypt or Tunisia.
The United Nations announced in New York that it had approved a
request for 45 EgyptAir flights to ferry some 6000 Libyan pilgrims from
Tripoli and Benghazi to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.--Reuter.

The island republic, backed by US forensic experts, sticks to its

SCOTSTOUN Leisure Centre breaks new ground for Glasgow City Council in
providing its first indoor tennis facility. With eight indoor tennis
courts and three outdoor synthetic grass courts, Scotstoun is the
largest and most exciting tennis facility in Scotland.
Located at the heart of Glasgow's West End, Scotstoun's new tennis
centre caters for everyone -- from beginners to advanced, youngsters to
50-plus customers, and social players through to those at matchplay
level.
There are numerous ways to take part in tennis at Scotstoun, from
''Pay and Play'', where you book a court and organise your own game,
through to coaching courses, which cater from beginner level onwards and
are coached by fully qualified Lawn Tennis Association coaches. These
courses run in eight-week blocks for about 37 weeks of the year.
If you want a middle option, ''Turn Up and Take Part'' social sessions
are also promoted at Scotstoun where you benefit from the odd tip from a
qualified coach who also sets up games among participants of similar
ability. The beauty of this option is that you don't even need to
organise your own partner to take part. The list of classes is endless,
from ''Early Risers'' to ''Big Bashers and Wee Smashers'', the latter
being a session where both parents and youngsters can take part.
The Parks and Recreation Department's Sport For Life For You strategy
has also ensured all members of the community receive equal access to
the new facility. This is amplified in the varied programme which is
being promoted at Scotstoun's new tennis centre, including special
programmes for women, 50-plus, children, and people with disabilities.
So Glasgow City Council has done its part -- now the ball is firmly in
your court.
* If you are interested in tennis at Scotstoun, information packs are
available from reception or by calling 0141 959 4000.

WHEN His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales inaugurates the #6.5m
Scotstoun Leisure Centre today he will be opening a facility dedicated
to the people of Glasgow. The new recreation complex, on the site of the
former Scotstoun Showground, is the flagship of the Parks and Recreation
Department of Glasgow City Council who have spent many months tailoring
the facilities to the needs of all members of the local community and
the wider public.
The centre opens to the public tomorrow with a packed programme of
activities. Facilities include Scotland's largest indoor tennis centre,
with eight courts; a multi-purpose sports hall the size of two
five-a-side courts or eight badminton courts; a 25m 10-lane swimming
pool with teaching pool and splash pool; a hi-tech fitness suite with
over 40 exercise machines; a mirrored aerobics/dance studio with sprung
floor and classes to suit all levels of fitness; and a luxurious health
suite with spa bath, steam room, saunas, relaxation TV room, and
high-powered sunbeds.
Overlooking the pool is the Freestyle Cafe, and bar facilities are
provided in Scotties Lounge; there are two Savannah function suites
overlooking the tennis hall, fully equipped with bar and catering
facilities and available for hire; a full-size floodlit synthetic pitch
suitable for football or hockey games or coached sessions; and three
outdoor synthetic grass tennis courts. Scot-tots offers the ultimate in
fun for children -- the softplay areas packed with equipment ideal for
jumping, sliding, and climbing.
Being part of Glasgow City Council's Parks and Recreation Department,
Scotstoun Leisure Centre boasts first-class facilities and no expensive
membership fees -- just pay as you go. Concessionary rates through the
department's ''Passport to Recreation'' scheme also allow those on low
incomes to enjoy the facilities at about half the normal rate during
most off-peak periods.
Scotstoun Leisure Centre is very much a facility for the people of
Glasgow, and although there will be competitions held, the real emphasis
has been on putting together a programme that really caters for them.
Bernard Connolly, Director of Parks and Recreation, said, ''The
introduction of Scotstoun Leisure Centre to the City of Glasgow is in
line with Glasgow City Council's ''Sport for Life for You'' strategy
which was published last year and confirms our commitment to encouraging
participation in as wide a range of sports for as many people and target
groups as possible.
''At Scotstoun there will be programmes for women, over 50s, children,
and people with disabilities, in addition to all the exciting new
facilities.''
For the over 50s there are over 20 classes from Slow Jive to Tai Chi,
and Aquafit to carpet bowls.
There is also an extensive children's programme which includes
everything from coached sessions to after-school clubs.
For children under eight there are two different types of Scot-tots
softplay sessions -- one supervised by a play leader so parents are free
to enjoy a leisure activity, and the other where the parents stay with
their children.''
There's also a creche for children under 18 months on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays between 10am and 12 noon, and Scot-tots is
available for children's parties on Saturdays and Sundays.
For people with disabilities there are activities like wheelchair
tennis and basketball.
Women are well catered for, with Tuesday nights devoted to women's
activities from 6pm onwards. For just #3.40 women can take part in over
a dozen different activities.
One of the most exciting facilities to look out for is undoubtedly the
new indoor tennis centre which has been developed by Glasgow City
Council in conjunction with the Scottish Sports Council and Indoor
Tennis Initiative.
Scotstoun Leisure Centre, which is very accessible, being just off the
main A814 Clydeside Expressway, opens at 7.30am on Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays and at 9am the rest of the week, closing at 10pm apart from
Saturday and Sunday when it shuts at 6pm.
''This is our showpiece centre, and although it's in the West End,
people will travel from all over Glasgow and beyond because the
facilities are good and affordable and there is something for
everyone,'' Bernard Connolly added.

THE Kirk is to be urged to call on the Government to ditch its Trident
submarines.
The Church of Scotland's influential Church and Nation Committee
believes Britain should change its policy of retaining Trident and
trying to remaining independent in the Start talks which are aimed at
the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.
The General Assembly of the Churgh of Scotland -- which meets next
month -- will be asked by the committee to urge the Government to
include Trident in the Start talks in moves to begin an orderly
reduction of nuclear weapons ''until they are eliminated from the face
of the earth''.
The committee will also ask the General Assembly to call on the
Government ''to prepare now to diversify the resources thus released
into alternative employment on peaceful purposes''.
It says in its report to the Assembly that the retention of Trident
makes no strategic sense in the post-Soviet bloc political situation and
can only make arguments for proliferation logically difficult to resist.
The report adds that the danger of handling and transporting nuclear
warheads material is unjustified.

WIDOW Rosemary West is formally to answer 10 murder charges during a
court appearance next month.
Mr Justice Mantell will take formal pleas on May 12 at Winchester
Crown Court, when the mother of eight will also face four counts
involving alleged rape and indecent assault.
Mrs West, 41, is accused of murdering nine young women -- including
her daughter Heather, 16 -- whose remains were found in her family home
and garden at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester.
She is also accused of murdering her stepdaughter Charmaine, eight,
whose remains were recovered in a police dig at a former home at 25
Midland Road, Gloucester.
The plea-taking will involve all the charges being formally read to
Mrs West.
Mr Justice Mantell, the senior presiding judge of the Western Circuit,
has provisionally set October 3 as the starting date for the Winchester
Crown Court trial, expected to last at least six weeks.
Mrs West's husband, Frederick, 53, was jointly accused on the same 10
murder charges.
He also faced a further two murder counts concerning his first wife,
Catherine, 25, and a former family nannie, Anne McFall.
He was found hanged in his Birmingham prison cell on New Year's Day.

THE Princess Royal was ''behind bars'' in the Highlands yesterday.
As patron of the prison visitors charity the Butler Trust, she visited
Porterfield prison in Inverness, which houses more than 100 inmates.
Princess Anne met members of staff at the prison which was the scene
of a bloody riot in 1972.
However, the ''cages'' where the violence broke out have now been
dismantled to form additional accommodation to relieve overcrowding in
the establishment.
The prison is also to house female prisoners as part of the expansion
which will hold up to 140 prisoners, from the Highlands, Islands, and
North-east.
Princess Anne came face-to-face with ''protected prisoners'' during
her visit and chatted to them for several minutes.
Officers escorted the Princess Royal into a high-security cell in the
prison's B Hall, in a section which is often used to house sex
offenders.
Porterfield prison holds one life-term prisoner, who was not
introduced to the Princess.

A NURSING home matron yesterday denied failing to administer vital
medication to an elderly patient.
Mrs Susanann Agnew, 45, who was matron of North Grove Nursing Home, in
Largs, Ayrshire, at the time of the incident, denied failing to
administer the drugs to the patient, known only as Mrs MM, between March
15 and 18, 1993.
The elderly woman needed the drugs to clear fluid from her lungs but
was allegedly not given her first dose until three days after a doctor's
visit.
Mrs Agnew was appearing before the Professional Conduct Committee of
the UK Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery, and Health Visiting, in
Glasgow.
She also denied failing to properly record an incident involving a
resident, known as Mrs JB, and administering the wrong dose of a drug to
a resident, Mrs EM.
She denied concealing the fact that Mrs EM had received the incorrect
dosage of a drug over a two-week period, delaying administering a drug
to a patient, known as Mrs AA, failing to re-order new supplies of her
medication, and asking nursing auxiliaries to administer medication.
Qualified nurse, Mrs Mary Smyth, who covered for Mrs Agnew two days a
week, said she noticed the drug, Frumil, had not been given to Mrs MM by
the Wednesday, three days after the doctor's visit.
''The woman was ill enough to have a doctor called out on the Monday
but she still had not received the drugs by the Wednesday,'' said Mrs
Smyth. ''I told Mrs Agnew that she would be in serious trouble if the
patient died.
''She said the drugs hadn't arrived because the chemist's computer was
broken but she should have borrowed the drugs from another patient or
gone to another chemist.''
Mr Alan Thomas, representing Mrs Agnew, said his client denied ever
having a conversation with Mrs Smyth about administering the drug.
Mrs Agnew was also accused of giving another patient, Mrs EM, a drug
dosage four times the prescribed strength between April 24 and May 7,
1993.
The woman had previously been admitted to hospital because she had had
too much of the drug, Digoxin. On returning to the home, she was to
receive 0.0625mg but instead was allegedly given 0.25mg.
''I told Mrs Agnew she would need to get the dosage reduced or she
would be in serious trouble,'' said Mrs Smyth. ''I was very concerned
because Mrs EM was an extremely ill woman. I believe what Mrs Agnew did
on May 8 was to take the label with the correct dosage and put it over
the bottle to make it look like the patient had been getting the correct
dosage all along.''
Mr Thomas asked about the ordering system for drugs and how Mrs Agnew
would know about changes in prescribed doses for patients.
''On your evidence, it would be impossible for any nurse on duty to
check any change in drugs which might have been brought about by a
doctor's visit,'' he said. ''How then could Mrs Agnew know about a
change which had been made?''
Mrs Smyth said there should have been a ''sticky label'' posted to
record any changes in prescriptions.
The hearing continues.

A NEW proposal for a simple auction system for milk in England and
Wales was issued by the Dairy Industry Federation yesterday. This would
replace the tendering system introduced with the removal of statutory
controls last November.
Neil Davidson, DIF president, said this system had brought turmoil to
the industry resulting in eight different pricing operations and
effective rationing of supplies to dairy operators.
The federation was looking for a simple, fair and transparent auction
system leading to a single market price for milk. He described this as
an olive branch to end the conflict with Milk Marque, the successor to
the Milk Marketing Board, which handles an estimated 69% of milk
produced in England and Wales.
''Buyers are looking to buy milk in England and Wales on the same
basis as they do throughout the world,'' said Mr Davidson. ''That
implies a simple selling system with the milk bought at the farm gate on
its natural pattern of production. With milk quotas, we in the UK are
short of milk and a simple auction house will ensure that farmers
receive full value.''
0 The proposals have been sent to Milk Marque but hopes of an early
settlement look remote. Andrew Dare, MM chief executive, said that in
developing its selling system the group had considered an auction system
in some detail but had rejected it for a number of reasons, including
the possibility of collusion among buyers and vulnerability of small to
medium sized businesses.
He said the proposals would be considered as just one part of MM's
continuing customer consultation process. But he added: ''The DIF has to
realise we are no longer in industry negotiation. In a free market it is
up to Milk Marque as the seller to decide how it markets its product.''

SHEEP farmer Leo Barclay picked the soft option yesterday. Instead of
being caught up in lambing on his 5000-acre estate at Kinloch Rannoch he
was decked out in a white coat at Ingliston, near Edinburgh, trying to
become a Tesco supplier -- not of lamb but of smoked wild venison.
In recent years, he admitted, his involvement in hill farming had
diminished as he and his wife Sarah had become more involved in the
running of their Rannoch Smokery. Shepherd Jim McInnes, now a partner in
the sheep enterprise, bore the brunt of the lambing of 850 blackface
ewes.
The smokery business began nine years ago as a sideline designed to
capitalise on the supply of wild venison culled on the hill. ''I was fed
up feeling that I had been taken to the cleaners by the game dealers,''
recalled Mr Barclay.
Today he is a customer of those same game dealers, buying up to 30
carcases a week. After being smoked gently over oak chips the venison is
despatched to such stores as Harrods and Jenners. On the supermarket
front, the Rannoch Smokery already supplies Safeway and Waitrose.
Turnover this year is expected to be #350,000, and by 1997 it is hoping
for #500,000 a year -- hence Mr Barclay's presence yesterday at a ''meet
the buyer'' event organised by Scottish Enterprise for the Tesco chain.
Tesco trading director Simon Uwins was there with a team of specialist
buyers to meet about 50 Scottish producers offering everything from
venison and fish to bakery goods and sweets.
Next to the Rannoch Smokery stall was Scotland's Tomatoes, the
marketing company for six major growers in the Clyde Valley, which sell
under the banner ''tomatoes with taste''.
The first of the crop was on display, pre-packed in plastic cartons
and bearing the Scotland's Tomatoes logo. The marketing company, under
the chairmanship of Jim Craig, already supplies a number of the major
supermarket chains. It is now aiming for the quality end of the market
and seeking a price premium over its Dutch rivals.
''We sell only in Scotland, in pre-packs which are designed to
distinguish our product from the Dutch competitors,'' said Mr Craig.
The growers who sell under the Scotland's Tomatoes umbrella represent
about 70% of the Clyde Valley production and aim to meet home market
demand from May to October. Together their output is about 15,000 tonnes
a year.
The 50 suppliers who put their goods on show for Tesco yesterday will
have to wait some time to see if they have won a contract. Those who are
being considered will be subject to a vetting process by the company's
food technologists who will want to be reassured of both consistent
quality and hygiene.

Stephen McGinty talks to Runrig about their new single, an album in
the making, the power of advertising -- and, of course, Rod who?
RUNRIG's drummer Iain Bayne is sitting on a sofa, eating a piece and
sausage and pondering. ''God, all that rock 'n' roll crap. And we were
told that Rod had asked for us especially. By the way, does anyone know
you're here?''
Here is the living-room of the Chapel Studios, tucked up inthe sleepy
village of South Thorsby, near Skegness. Runrig are not on retreat, but
two weeks into recording their latest album -- as yet untitled.
And no, no-one knows I'm here; well Donnie doesn't, and who else is
there? Runrig's radio voice and TV face is next door laying down tracks,
while Iain and I and watch telly.
''Yeah, it was a bit disappointing; we had a laugh, though. I liked
the cartoon in one paper of two Runrig fans going to the concert and
asking: 'Rod . . . who?' ''
Rod Stewart may have forgotten to remember Runrig at his recent Ibrox
press conference, but Jonathan King didn't. The pop picker tried to
persuade the band to enter the Eurovision Song Contest with their new
single An Abhul As Airde (The Highest Apple).
It is an illustration of the power of advertising that since the song
was first used late last year as the soundtrack to a 40-second
commercial, both the band's label, Chrysalis, and Carlsberg, have been
bombarded with phone calls from people looking for the music.
The cricket game on a sandy beach -- which was shot in South Africa,
not Scotland, during our one good summer day -- was brewed up by Paul
Domenetand Peter Harold, of the London-based advertising agency
CME-KHBB.
Harold heard the song on the radio and mentioned it to Domenet, who
rummaged around his Runrig collection to find The Cutter And The Clan,
where it originally appeared. Since Runrig don't play on the Sabbath, it
was surprising that they agreed to a song being used to boost lager
sales.
By now the song's author, Calum MacDonald, has walked into the
living-room and slumped down into an easy chair. He's joined by Donnie
Munro and later big brother Rory.
''There is a debate to be had about whether we should enter into the
whole area . . . initially my feeling was that I didn't want the song to
be used for that, but I think I was wrong.
''Now I'm glad, because so many people have heard it. There have been
loads of phone calls, and people have picked up on our music. So it's
just a tool.''
In Donnie Munro's opinion, the move is less an indictment of the band
than the restrictive radio policy of the contemporary stations. ''That
song was very special to us on the album. It's a song we hoped would
reach as many people as possible.
''It just happens that we are living at a time when that is not
possible by other means, ie radio, because of restrictive policy. DJs
can't play the songs they want. It's now a fact that film and adverts
can offer a wider audience.''
Calum wrote the song in minutes in the Uist countryside, shortly after
his father, Donald John MacDonald, a social worker, died. In the
Palladium studio in Edinburgh during recording, the simple Gaelic words
transformed as tapes were stretched to get high voices, and actual psalm
presenting was sampled.
''It was written on a wet Wednesday on Uist, it was written just after
my dad died. It's a hymn, that's really all it's about -- an expression
of faith and looking for meaning.
''No matter how much you search, and whatever faith feeds you, there
is always that unobtainable dimension that has to be there, otherwise it
wouldn't be faith . . . Pretty incongruous that it's a Carlsberg ad six
years on, though.''
No cases of Carlsberg cans clutter the galley kitchen where bacon is
frying, or the lived-in living-room which two weeks ago became home. The
12-hour days begin around 10am in the little studio -- where Del Amitri
cut their last album and Wet Wet Wet recorded Goodnight Girl -- and
leave little time for drinking.
The band moved south towards solitude in Skegness when Rod Stewart
burst their bubble. Opinion in the band would like to favour a shrewd
publicity stunt, but Rory MacDonald isn't sure . . . ''I think he was
genuinely bemused.''
Still they know it'll be resolved favourably. Says Calum MacDonald:
''Yeah, you can see it in the Daily Record, all of us in football strips
with ROD FORGIVES RUNRIG.''
Rory MacDonald: ''No! RUNRIG FORGIVES ROD.''
Donnie Munro: ''SPARE THE ROD?''
Talk drifts over to the vinyl foetus they are carrying through its
first few weeks. It is to have a simple birth, away from hi-tech
entanglements. Just as we talk, Iain Bayne walks past with two plastic
spoons and a baking bowl covered in Clingfilm.
''It's getting back to the heart. With all the equipment that's
available to you, it's tempting and a distraction. We want to cut right
through very directly,'' said Donnie: a point echoed, naturally, by
Calum MacDonald. ''Music is about emotion. That's got to be the starting
point, and simplicity. In a studio you've got thousands of pounds of
equipment and the tendency is to put more on so it ends up very full and
the heart is lost.''
A Runrig interview tends to scribble its own Scottish agenda with
comments about politics and identity. That cluttered cul-de-sac was
ignored. A biography of the late John Smith sat on the table and a
Scottie dog ran around. Obsessed parties can read the signs.
Instead, I queried, if adverts were a potential new musical medium,
which ones did the band like? Rory favoured the advert for Michelin
tyres, in which Carl Lewis runs across the water to Manhattan. ''That's
a stunning advert.'' Munro was more nostalgic. ''In terms of music, I
loved the Tennents advert with the ball being rolled up the hill.''
Calum admits to being inspired by Nike. ''It was the Nike ad first run
during the World Cup. It starts with Cantona kicking a ball and the ball
going across the world. I found that quite inspiring, and wrote an awful
song about communication. That song will not appear on any album.''
Brother Rory injects the irony: ''The message in that is don't watch
adverts as an inspiration for songs.''
* An Ubhal As Airde is released on Monday on Crysalis.

AILEEN LITTLE talks to an artist who is inspired by the mystery of one
of the last great wildernesses.
JAMES Morrison says he is feeling disturbed. Fortunately for the
landscape painter who is a favourite with the Duke of Edinburgh, the
condition is temporary. But it is a state of mind likely to last till
the paint on the last canvas is dry in readiness for his Edinburgh
exhibition of collected Arctic works.
''You get bitten by the Arctic -- I find it hard to clear my mind of
the experience,'' he says. ''It's partly because I'm constantly
struggling to record the intense feeling of stillness and space. And
partly it's because I come home and set against the purity of the Arctic
the debased quality of life in the UK.''
Glasgow-born Morrison has visited the High Arctic three times, always
based in Canada's Ellesmere Island, 500 miles from the Pole. The 1990
and 1992 painting trips to this 450-mile stretch of tundra were
topographical and tentative. The artist explains: ''In my Scottish
landscapes, I'm picking up references from previous work. All the Arctic
work is explorative.''
The most recent trip -- three weeks last August -- was a new
departure. Instead of living, Nansen-like in a tented encampment, he
opted to stay in Inouit settlements. The first was at Grise Fjord,
Ellesmere's most northerly settlement and home to 101 Inouits (the word
means people). For the second stage of his expedition, Morrison flew to
Qaanaaq, the most northerly community in Greenland, with a population of
500.
At Grise Fjord he booked into the Inouit Co-operative which comprises
an inn (occupied mainly by service personnel such as telephone
engineers) and a store. This stocks everything from T-shirts and
convenience foods to rifles -- a must in the land of the polar bear.
The chairman of the settlement council ticked Morrison off for setting
out unarmed; fortunately, the only wildlife he encountered were little
auk, seals, ptarmigan and walrus. One day, he came across the village
dead-eye. ''She was a granny, sitting outside the inn, knitting. Every
so often, she'd lay down her pins, shoot a surfacing seal, then yell for
someone to pick up the carcass.''
Despite university degrees, a technologically equipped school and
children reared on television, the Inouits of Grise still kill 92% of
what they eat. And they eat a lot of it raw. Morrison found uncooked
seal ''hellish''.
He may have refused a rifle but, in other respects James Morrison was
heavily armed. This Montrose-based artist likes to paint big (3ft by 5ft
boards are the norm). He is to oils what David Lean was to celluloid,
and he freights his equipment ahead to Resolute Bay, the main staging
post for High Arctic travel.
He also likes to paint outdoors. Since there are no roads on
Ellesmere, the logistics of physically lugging gear to a scenic spot are
nothing short of mind-boggling. But good luck intervened. On the first
trip, he met up with an American, Tom Buckley from Cape Cod, a man as
smitten with the Scottish artist's work and with the Arctic itself. The
two have become firm friends, Buckley playing Boswell to Morrison's Dr
Johnson. ''Wherever I was going, he'd help me there, then disappear. I'd
just be finishing when he'd appear over the horizon . . .''
What Morrison has produced is a mesmerising testament to the power of
the Arctic: Professor Duncan McMillan has negotiated with Morrison's
agents, the Scottish Gallery, to show some 50 massive pictures in
Edinburgh's Talbot Rice Gallery from next week.
Whether he is depicting calving glaciers, glistening bergs, the eerie
calmness of floes, the intensive light of 24-hour sunshine on fretted
cliffs or the inky blues of brooding skies, James Morrison uncannily
conveys the mystery of one of the last great wildernesses.
He has felt coldness radiate from the rearing wall of a glacier. He
has viewed mountain peaks 100 miles off. And he has witnessed elemental
tricks of cloud and fog worthy of the Ancient Mariner.
But he's not satisfied yet -- hence that feeling of being disturbed.
Nothing, he reckons, quite captures the overwhelming nature of a
landscape in which man seems irrelevant. Uniquely for Morrison, he has
spent hours following his trip working obsessively on the moods of the
Arctic. So the Talbot Rice exhibition falls into two parts: work painted
en plein air and work painted in the studio.
His philosophy matches that of the Inouits who have no concept of
aesthetics. Their main criterion is that art should describe its subject
matter properly. Both in craftsmanship and aesthetics, Inouit art is at
least the equal of contemporary Western art.
* James Morrison -- Arctic Paintings is on at the Talbot Rice Gallery
in Edinburgh from Tuesday until May 20, 10am to 5pm.

LAST year Radio One-institution John Peel promoted himself in
typically self-effacing style with the line, ''He's bald, he's fat, he
isn't where it's at'' -- a legend that could equally well be applied to
Morrison, a singular and sometimes solitary Celtic voice in whom the
recent resurgence of interest seems very much at odds with market
forces.
Mumbling and unprepossessing, there is little on which to judge
Morrison other than his music, which last night was culled primarily
from his six most recent albums. With a powerful nine-piece band, which
included the potent voice of Brian Kennedy, who perversely took over
lead vocals on the older songs like Sweet Thing and Tupelo Honey,
Morrison will rarely have had so strong a platform from which to shine.
The man himself was also in good form, his attention focused and his
voice at the peak of its emotive range as he trawled through its usual
repertoire of highs and lows, almost developing a stage presence as
conductor of his band, hands swinging alongside him, where in the past
any such sign of enjoyment would have been concealed.
Highlights are the succinct Wonderful Remark and Real Real Gone and
the ever wistful Vanlose Stairway. Ironically, the new songs No Religion
and Days Like This hint that Van could be about to make the first great
album of his now substantial post-1979 output.
On another new song he declares: ''I want to stick around/I don't fade
away unless I want to.'' The passion seems to be returning to the beauty
of his music and for two-and-a-half hours last night Van Morrison was
most definitely where it's at.

THE Commons remaining locked in the sordid political battle --
Environment questions: -- ''What assessment has been made of the damage
done to British wildlife by the feral mink?'' followed even more
pulsatingly by the report stage of the Agricultural Tenancies Bill -- it
seemed a good day to visit the Upper House.
Renowned in constitutional textbooks for their ability to stage
thoughtful debates on deeper matters than attract the chaps and
chapesses in the popular Chamber, the peers, it turned out, were living
up to their reputation.
Lord Simon of Glaisdale, a Law Lord, decided to invite the House to
consider ''the Swiss Federation as a constitutional model''. The Sketch,
a keen viewer of ''The Adventures of William Tell'' in its now distant
youth and like many another Briton a pleased holidaymaker in that
beautiful and well ordered land, thought this was just the thing. The
Swiss seemed to do almost everything well. Surely we could learn quite a
bit from them.
As the debate wore on, however, it became clear that Lord Beloff
(Con.) had hit the nail on the head when, with delicate irony, he
congratulated Lord Simon on introducing a subject ''on which almost
anything can be said with relevance''.
Lord Inglewood, the Old Etonian Whip replying for the Government,
politely likened the discussion to a ''cherry picking expedition'' in
which speakers looked for some aspect of the Swiss constitution which
suited their own constitutional views and applied it to Britain,
Northern Ireland, the European Union or the world.
Several speakers saw Scotland and Wales as subject nations smarting
under alien English rule and patronised or ignored by English
institutions. Lord Cockfield (Con.) a former EC Commissioner, let the
BBC have both barrels over the notorious Panorama interview -- ''an
English institution with its headquarters close to Carnaby Street with a
philosophy to match''.
After a bit of semantic fencing, the peers agreed that Switzerland was
a federation and Lord Cockfield thought the UK should become one too,
changing its name to the United Kingdoms.
Lord Taylor of Gryfe (Lab.) thought Tony Blair might turn out to be
Scotland's William Tell via his devolution proposals. When he first
joined the House, he confided, he went along to a meeting of its
Anglo-Swiss committee only to find they talked about ski-ing rather than
the Swiss constitution.
Lord Lyell (Con.) followed this up by recounting how in his youth he
sustained a triple fracture of the leg on the ski slopes, spending two
years in hospital which gave him ample time to study the Swiss
constitution. Lord Beloff, a distinguished historian, regretted that
even Switzerland which resists the foolish fads of the rest of the
Western world, was not quite what it used to be. ''Zurich is no longer
the haven of peace and respectability it was when Lenin lived there,''
he said sadly.
Switzerland's decentralised government and referendums were popular
with almost everyone apart, predictably, from the Minister. Lord Moyle
(Con.) thought its ability to produce a Motorists Party with eight MPs
was ''worth all the cones and hotlines one can imagine''.
Quite carried away with his enthusiasm for referendums he said his
vision of the future was a terminal in every home in which we could all
vote at the touch of a button on all the issues of the day.
Lord Archer of Sandwell, for Labour, apparently enthused by this,
suggested that the United Nations should be elected with a government
responsible for the planet not just a nation. That was not, he hastily
added, Labour Party policy.
Lord Inglewood, translated out of ministerial jargon, arrived at Lord
Beloff's more robustly expressed conclusion that Switzerland was too
idiosyncratic a nation to serve as a model for anywhere else. Not
wanting to push democracy too far, Lord Simon said he would not
precipitate a vote. A neutral conclusion seemed, in this context, the
right one.

DONAL O'KELLY'S modern Irish play sweeps round the planet to bring a
blast of global politics into this intimate studio space. The theme is
illegal immigration; the setting a present-day Dublin where a solicitor
takes up the case of a Ugandan refugee while her immigration officer
brother is trying to send him back home.
In many respects O'Kelly is presenting us with a shock report from the
front line of fear and degradation caused by man's inhumanity to man. We
hear tales of torture and oppression brought back from Africa and
Berlin, we see bureaucratic indifference to people who have fallen
outside the net of legality, and we learn of tensions to come as Europe
tightens up its immigration regulations.
This is substance enough to build Asylum! Asylum! into a gripping,
sometimes harrowing political drama, but there is a broader issue that
seems to be at the soul of O'Kelly's play which is to do with our own
complicity in the heartless mechanics of state, government, in fact any
power greater than ourselves.
We are, the playwright seems to suggest, beset by an inability or
unwillingness to say ''no'', a jobsworth mentality that permits abuses
of power by passing on the burden of morality up the line.
All this comes across in a Wiseguise production, directed by Kenneth
Glenaan, which is weak on style and physicality, seeming uncertain about
where to place the actors and too often just letting them act as talking
heads, but which, thanks to committed performances, notably from David
Barker as the deportee, Anne Marie Timoney as the solicitor, and Laurie
Ventry as the immigration man, grows into an angry, incisive, and
provocative piece of theatre.

LEFT-WING firebrand Jimmy Airlie found himself under criticism from
the politically correct mob at the STUC conference in Perth this week.
During a splendid speech on the plight of the Rolls-Royce workers
facing the dole at East Kilbride, Jimmy's tongue got a wee bit ahead of
his brain when he declared that you can't be world class if you treat
highly skilled workers like serfs, as if they came from Bangladesh.
The PC monitors' ears pricked up, and the plight of 600 workers facing
the sack in East Kilbride was quickly forgotten as it was demanded that
Airlie apologise for a racist remark.
Airlie, who has long campaigned on Third World issues, was heard to
ponder later if he should apologise by saying he meant to say Catholics.
But on reflection, he decided against it. Irony is not a strong weapon
when combating the forces of the politically correct.
Shell shocked
WE went on at great length the other day about the good old days in
Rouken Glen when we forgot about our rickets, malnutrition, and having
to share our shoes with the other 25 members of the family and made our
way to the park to roll our Easter eggs.
We have been trumped on the poverty reminiscence front by a Mr Daniel
Conlan from Maryhill. ''You think you were poor,'' he says. ''We got a
hard-boiled egg to decorate at Easter. When we went to the park to roll
the egg, my mother gave us matchboxes with instructions to collect all
our bits of egg shell and put them in it. Then at Christmas time we got
the matchbox back as a jigsaw.''
* STILL on the egg-rolling front we have to report some nefarious
behaviour at no less an event than the Easter Sunday family day
organised by the Allan Church of Scotland in Bannockburn. As part of the
activities, the faithers had to take part in a competition for the
longest roll of an egg.
Experienced egg-rollers will know that there is no point in hurling
the egg into the air as it will merely explode on landing and will not
continue in a forward motion. The winner of the competition managed,
however, to chuck his egg mightily and have it land and then tumble
forward in a seemingly endless progress.
Some of the faithers put the success down to technique. Others to
luck. Yet others demanded a stewards' inquiry, the result of which is
that competitors will not in future be allowed to keep their hard-boiled
eggs in the freezer for a week before the event.
Fated
WE have two communications from Scottish Opera. The first says: ''Due
to illness, Hitomi Katagiri has withdrawn from the role of Preziosilla,
which will now be sung by Elizabeth Vaughan.'' The second: ''Due to
illness, Elizabeth Vaughan has withdrawn from the role of Preziosilla,
which will now be sung by Clare Shearer.'' The opera in question? La
Forza del Destino.
Seen but not heard
DELICATE are the negotiations at the sharp end of politics. Douglas
Alexander, the fresh-faced Labour candidate in the Perth and Kinross
by-election, sought to achieve some reflected glory by being seen with
deputy party leader John Prescott yesterday.
He suggested that he could accompany Prescott by car from Edinburgh
Airport and be seen to arrive with him at Perth. Prescott's staff agreed
after much discussion, with the proviso that Douglas didn't speak to the
Great Man during the journey as he had to write his speech.
Which was probably a wrong decision, as Douglas made quite a
reputation as a speechwriter when he worked for Gordon Brown.
Safety glass
THE work on the new north stand at Celtic Park proceeds apace. The
windows are being installed in the hospitality suites. We know this
because the contractor for the aforementioned windaes, Skytech Forster,
has written to tell us about its ''polyamide systems in Celtic colours''
which have been used. Very good, but we wonder why they felt obliged to
tell us that ''the company's enhanced fire, bomb blast and bullet
resistant systems are regularly specified for Ministry of Defence
contracts''. We thought Michael Kelly had left the Parkhead board.
READERS who can remember as far back as last week may remember Carrick
Cumnock. He is a Scottish politician entirely invented by the Sunday
Times newspaper when its TV listings section told us of a programme
involving ''Phil Gallie, Carrick Cumnock, and George Foulkes''. We
decided that Carrick Cumnock deserved to live on, and what we needed was
a keek at his CV. Ian Robertson of Ayr duly obliged:
''Carrick Cumnock has just been selected as Tory parliamentary
candidate for West Ayrshire. As younger son of the Earl of Drongan, his
credentials are impeccable. On leaving Eton he was commissioned in the
Scots Guards and later spent several years managing the ancestral
estates on Hertfordshire. When these had to be sold, he joined Barings
Bank, where he is now regarded as one of the top men in rouble
futures.''
In his selection speech the following points secured his nomination.
* His sister Ffyona has a job in Tory central office.
* He never misses the Burns Supper at the Caledonian Club.
* His grandmother once went to Troon for her holidays.
* If elected he will buy a house in Ayrshire.
Mr Robertson wins a bottle of hooch, but we are sure there is more we
should know about Carrick Cumnock.

Washington, Wednesday
TURKISH Prime Minister Tansu Ciller today scoffed at threats to her
safety amid reports that police had detained 21 members of a left-wing
group suspected of planning to kill her.
''I am not worried about the situation in my country or myself,'' she
told reporters before meeting President Clinton.
Ciller added that military operations against Kurdish guerrillas in
northern Iraq had reached the mopping-up stage, but she declined to say
when the incursion would end.
''The majority of the job is done and over with. The withdrawal will
be very soon,'' Ciller said.
In another development, Turkish troops claimed to have killed Semdin
Sakik, a leading Kurdish rebel commander, in a huge offensive in eastern
Turkey today.--Reuter.

Yet another wedding and perhaps too many funerals: William Russellv
iews the latest black comedies
BUENA Vista is understandably marketing Muriel's Wedding (15) as if it
were this year's comedy about weddings and funerals as well as a direct
descendant of Strictly Ballroom and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. In
other words, a jolly, mindless Technicolour romp from Australia.
In reality, however, Muriel's Wedding is a black comedy which gets
blacker as it progresses. Beneath the surface gloss the film, written
and directed by P J Hogan, is actually rather a sour affair.
For about three quarters of an hour it all seems glorious, albeit very
vulgar fun, as fat, plain, unemployed, unemployable Muriel Heslop gets
arrested for shoplifting the dress she is wearing to a wedding.
Another guest, a store detective, recognises it, which is hardly
suprising since it is a leopard skin print Liz Brewer-type horror, once
seen, never forgotten -- and then goes on holiday univited to Hibiscus
Island, one of those teenage resorts where anything goes, to which her
girlfriends have decamped, making clear they do not want her tagging
along.
Muriel, played by a spectacularly overweight dough-faced actress with
thighs like hams called Toni Colette, lives in an appalling suburb of
Sydney called Porpoise Spit. Her father, a local councillor, played by
Bill Hunter, is as bent as they come, her mother, Jeannie Drynan, a
downtrodden drudge, and her brothers and sisters a thoroughly
unappealing bunch of couch potatoes. All Muriel wants is to be accepted
by her girlfriends and to get married.
When her father, in an attempt to find her a job, arranges for her to
work for his mistress, a beauty consultant, Muriel persuades her mother
to make the cheque she has to take to the lady to pay for the training
out to cash and duly absconds with the contents of her father's bank
account.
She spends it on going to Hibiscus Island and meets Rhonda (Rachel
Griffiths giving a beautfully judged performance), another outcast from
the ranks of Porpoise Spit's beautiful people, but one with infinitely
more spunk than Muriel.
Rhonda can cope with their nastiness and does so spectacularly, after
which the pair win the holiday talent contest with an extremely funny
act miming to an Abba song and become the heroines of the hour. So far,
so good.
But once Muriel and Rhonda settle in Sydney the tone darkens and the
film's strident tone starts to become wearing. Muriel, obsessed with
finding a husband, settles for a wedding of convenience to an appalling,
if gorgeous, South African swimmer who wants Australian nationality, and
Rhonda gets cancer of the spine. A wedding, a suicide, and Heslop family
ruin follow and things become no laughing matter.
Part of the trouble is that Muriel is not so much a downtrodden worm
who turns as a chip off the old block. She is her father's daughter in
every sense, once she learns the rules of the game. The marketing, on
the other hand, implies it is a film about an ugly duckling who becomes
a swan of sorts when it is about how a selfish, if unloved, woman learns
there is more to life than she had imagined.
Suburban Sydney is viciously satirised. Hogan has written some
bitchily funny scenes involving the girls of Porpoise Spit, and the
production has that garish splendour, all primary clashing colours, one
has come to associate with Australian films.
There is much to enjoy, but Hogan's reach has rather exceeded his
grasp. Take it at face value and you may laugh like a drain, but the
chances are you will find that somehow it gets less funny as it goes
along. Successful black comedy -- Joe Orton's plays are a case in point
-- just gets funnier the nastier it becomes.
The problem about Outbreak, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, is that
deadly plagues which cannot be controlled are no longer the stuff of
simple entertainment. The Aids virus has seen to that.
The film belongs to that long line of deadly virus thrillers -- Panic
in the Streets, The Satan Bug or The Cassandra Crossing -- which start
from the premise that something fatal to man is on the loose and must be
halted.
Dustin Hoffman, relishing an unusual action-hero leading role -- the
part was originally offered to Harrison Ford -- plays an army doctor who
specialises in disease control.
The inhabitants of a small Californian town are getting sick and dying
within days. Can he discover where the virus has come from, what it is,
what is carrying it, and what the antidote is before the mad general in
charge of the operation, Donald Sutherland flashing his eyes and camping
it up horribly, has the place firebombed?
The story begins 20 years earlier in Africa where a village has been
similarly affected and the army has chosen this solution to the problem.
The trouble is that while the flames disposed of the human sufferers
they did not dispose of the carriers -- the local monkeys, immune
themselves. A monkey, illegally imported into the US, has brought the
virus to California. Hoffman makes a passable hero, while Rene Russo, as
his estranged wife, also a disease control specialist, provides the
necessary glamour and some tension when she too gets infected.
Morgan Freeman is the other general in charge, one of the two disease
specialists, Sutherland was the other one, who had the village
firebombed. We are, it can be no surprise to anybody, involved in the
aftermath of a germ warfare experiment which went wrong and the two
generals are fighting like mad to destroy the evidence of their guilt.
Peterson keeps the action and the military hardware moving at top
speed, Hoffman makes a surpisingly effective hero, and were it not for a
truly appalling glib resolution the film would be a high-class example
of the genre. But how Hoffman saves the world is a blatant case of
asking the audience to believe pigs can fly, and they cannot.
The Taviani brothers' Fiorile is about the curse of ill-gotten wealth
which affects generation after generation of a Tuscan family. It is an
episodic tale starting in the present as a husband and wife, young son
and daughter, drive from Florence to visit the man's father.
The children discover, when they stop at an old palace, now a hotel,
that the local people believe their family cursed and persuade their
father to tell them the family history, after which past and present
merge seamlessly together.
The trouble is one cannot see why the gold, a trunk full of coins
belonging to Napoleon's army, which accidentally fell into the hands of
a peasant family, the Benedetti -- known ever after as Maledetti --
should be cursed. It seems that Jean, the young lieutenant in charge,
who has impregnated Elisabetta, a Benedetti daughter he met in the
woods, is shot for losing the money.
She swears revenge for his death, saying she would never find peace
until she has done so, and this is the curse which must work its way
through the family history.
The episodes are all handsomely done, but the links are tenuous and
interest is mainly sustained by the Tuscan scenery. Fiorile, by the way,
is the French Revolution name for May, and was what Jean called
Elisabetta.

A DEVICE designed to stop high-speed joyriders had a more prosaic
introduction to service when Lothian and Borders police recently
deployed it for the first time.
The force's ''stinger device'', a plastic mat carrying two-inch long
spikes designed to deflate the tyres of vehicles being pursued,
successfully trapped a JCB digger.
The mat was brought into action after officers were called to a
building site at Flotterston, near Penicuik in Midlothian.
Two youths were seen to drive away the JCB, estimated to be worth
#35,000. When challenged by police they refused to stop and headed
towards Penicuik.
After permission to use the device was given, it was placed across the
roadway in Carlops Road.
The digger trundled on until it was eventually intercepted and its
front tyres deflated.
Police confirmed yesterday that the incident was the first in which
the device had been put into operation.
* Earlier this week, two youths appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court
and admitted stealing the digger. They had their sentences deferred
pending reports.

AS the finger of suspicion points at Middle-East involvement in the
Oklahoma attrocity, Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned that
''terror must be cut off before terror hits again.''
At the United Nations, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued
a statement saying he was ''horrified at the loss of innocent lives,
especially young children, caused by this cowardly attack.''
''How deeply we share the sorrow and the pain with the president of
the United States and the people of the United States because of the
terrible terror act in Oklahoma City,'' Mr Rabin said in a message of
sorrow to President Clinton. ''Our hearts and feelings are with the
families of the victims.''
President Ezer Weizman also cabled his condolences to Mr Clinton,
Israel Radio said.
Citing ''the very large and sad Israeli experience in such cases,''
Rabin said his government stood ready to help in whatever way it could
and had extended that offer to US Ambassador Martin Indyk.
Asked about the Israeli offer, US Attorney General Janet Reno said:
''We will, of course, rely on any additional resource than can possibly
be involved and be utilized appropriately in bringing these people to
justice.''
In Canada, authorities played down that country's vulnerability to
such an attack.
In a letter to Clinton, Prime Minister Jean Chretien said ''the hopes
and prayers of all Canadians are with those who have suffered injuries
and who have lost loved ones in this terrible disaster.''
''Canadians were shocked and outraged as they learned of the magnitude
of the human and physical destruction left in the wake of this bombing
incident,'' he said.

In scientific terms a new film of the medical thriller genre,
Outbreak, is credible. JENNIFER CUNNINGHAM reports on emerging viruses
PLAGUE, rabies, Aids, the scourge changes through the centuries but
the fear remains the same. Man is a craven creature in a cruel world,
but also the species with the potential to tame the virulent forces and
save the race and maybe the planet.
This week's statistics showing that tuberculosis is at its highest
level for 30 years among the homeless is a grim reminder that the
antibiotic armoury and the defences of good nutrition and sanitation
need to be kept up to strength to keep illness at bay.
For a generation now, as well as TB, the scourges of diphtheria,
polio, scarlet fever have been largely confined to medical history. We
have been immunised against them, but we also have a psychological
immunity to healthy young people dying suddenly from infections. Slowly
that incomprehension has been breached by Aids but the initial
frightened reaction to it was not dissimilar to that which greeted
bubonic plague.
Hot viruses will become the hot topic of dinner table debate when the
film Outbreak opens tomorrow. Warner Bros are billing it as a medical
thriller, but this age-old stand-off between the forces of darkness and
of good is topical faction rather than fiction. The story-line develops
from the release of a highly-contagious and invariably fatal virus from
an African monkey into a small-town community. It must be contained and
quickly. The moral dilemma is how.
As a scientific scenario, it is quite credible according to Dr James
Morrison of the Institute of Biomedical and Life Sciences at Glasgow
University. ''In many cases we can immunise against viruses, but the
important concept just now is the emerging virus. There is probably no
such thing as a new virus, but it may be new to the human population.
Viruses of another species -- usually from the tropics -- which are able
to grow in the cells of the human body and thus cross the species
barrier are a major concern,'' he said.
The hot words are Hanta, Ebola and Marburg. They are the viruses which
have already crossed the species barrier and claimed human lives. What
is most disturbing about them is they way they get to work on their
human host, turning body tissue into mush -- with no vaccine or remedy
to stop the process. The Ebola virus had a devastating effect in Zaire.
In five villages it killed 88% of people infected with it.
The official reaction of the developed world was close to panic when
it was discovered in 1989 in monkeys imported for research in Virginia.
All the monkeys were destroyed by workers wearing space suits to protect
them from contamination. That episode was described in dramatic detail
in The Hot Zone, a best-seller destined to become a film until it was
clear that Outbreak had won the race.
Marburg is a milder virus, which was first identified in a West German
laboratory in 1967. Again there is a connection with monkeys, this time
African green monkeys from Uganda whose kidney cells were used to make
polio vaccines. Seven of the 31 people infected died within a month.
Two years ago a virus which killed two-thirds of those who caught it
suddenly affected healthy young adults among a tribe of Navaho Indians
living in a reservation in America. The Centre for Disease Control in
Atlanta identified it as a new species of Hanta virus, a large group
first identified during the Korean War and named from the Hantaan river.
The US virologists found that mice carry a virus with identical genes.
Similar viruses, but of a much milder strain, have been found in other
parts of the world including one in Somerset. The subsequent theory that
the lethal epidemic was caused by a substantial increase in the mouse
population resulting from a bumper crop of the nuts they feed on is a
pointed demonstration of the interdependence of all the species in the
eco-system.
We also have to come to terms with these repeated examples that by
importing African animals, life-saving medical research is the agent of
new diseases.
The paradox is acknowledged by the film's producer, Arnold Kopelson.
He said: ''Outbreak is based on scientific possibility. The most
frightening aspect of this story is the real potential of such a
contagion developing in the world at any given moment.''

AN ELECTRICAL fault -- not terrorist action -- was the most likely
cause of the fire which badly damaged the Stormont parliament building
in Northern Ireland in January, the Commons was told yesterday.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said an investigation
into the fire by Sir Reginald Doyle had pointed to ''deeply disturbing''
shortcomings in fire safety measures.
''I am determined to address the shortcomings in the most serious
manner,'' Sir Patrick told MPs.
He added the damage would cost #1.5m to put right.
In Sir Reginald's view, the most likely cause of the fire on January 2
was ''an electrical fault in the wiring below the Speaker's Chair in the
Commons Chamber'', Sir Patrick said.
''He considers that it is improbable that the fire was started
deliberately.''
Setting out the areas of concern, Sir Patrick said that the
watchkeepers in Parliament Buildings had not detect the fire and
incorrectly attributed an unusual smell to new lagging on heating pipes.
Further, part of the first floor of the building was not patrolled
because one section was subject to restricted access.
There also had been no water supply to the fire hydrant system when
the fire broke out due to a valve at the Stormont reservoir having been
closed, and over a a period of nearly five years there had been no fire
drill -- which Sir Patrick said was ''inexcusable''.
He said three officials had been reprimanded over the non-availability
of water, which had been reported 18 days before the fire but not acted
upon.
Sir Patrick added: ''I have taken steps to ensure that those
responsible for these matters in all Crown buildings in Northern Ireland
are in no doubt about their responsibilities and of my continuing
concern that these are properly exercised.''
For Labour, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Dr Marjorie Mowlam said
she agreed that some of Sir Reginald's findings were ''deeply
disturbing''.
She added: ''It is sad that it has taken a fire to make these policy
shortcomings transparent.''
Mr Peter Robinson (Belfast East -- DUP) said that ''complacency'' had
''trickled down from the very highest level to produce the degree of
incompetence that this report indicates''.
Mr Robinson urged: ''If heads are to roll on Stormont lawn, then let
it be some easily recognised heads.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alan Beith said there had been at
Stormont ''an appalling level of laxity in the management and care of
the buildings, which is all the more worrying in a situation where
security risks have meant that heightened awareness has been necessary
all the time''.

Andrew Wilson was lost, feared dead, in a Braemar blizzard. He tells
STEPHEN McGINTY of how, in being found, his survival yet puzzles him and
deeply affects his comprehension of God
ANDREW Wilson is still waiting. Not for the mountain rescue team which
searched the slopes of Braemar for three days. They arrived, followed by
the blizzard of newsprint in February. Nor is he waiting to walk back to
work. Wilson worked his first full day a week last Monday.
He is waiting for the pain in his frost-bitten feet to fade. In bed a
small cardboard box sits under the sheets as a shelter from the
pressure. But that is not it. Wilson is waiting for the mental obsession
to pass. For the moments when he broods on how his ordeal could have
been avoided, but comes up with no answer.
He was told to expect depression but didn't believe it till it arrived
as dark thoughts about death. He is sure it will pass, but that is not
what he is waiting for.
Wilson is waiting for God.
Fifty-one days after he became lost on a cross-country ski-trip across
the hills near the Cairngorms, Andrew Wilson, 45, is still coming to
terms with the miracle of his survival.
For two nights he sheltered in a snow hole. On the second he prayed
and had his much-publicised ''chat with God''. Calmed and convinced he
would either die and be with God or survive, he staggered out on the
third day and was spotted from the heavens by helicopter.
In the little flat he shares with his wife Marion in Croftfoot Wilson
has sat and watched the news as the bodies of climbers have been
recovered. ''I feel for the families, why did their husbands and sons
die and I walked out . . . I don't know, other than God wants something
else from me.
''Why did God answer my question: Yes and others: No? I have this
belief that something is going to happen. I have no right to be sitting
here while others are inside wooden boxes in the ground.''
He does not know what the event will be. Perhaps it has passed. His
stirring story of survival on Songs of Praise touched many lives and he
has already been asked to film a Christian video -- an offer he feels he
will decline, for he is not an ostentatious man.
His recovery has been both physical and metaphysical. The frostbite
which left his toes painful and swollen could have resulted in
amputation, though the doctors did not let him know this. ''I only
recently found out that they were worried I might lose some toes. But
that worry is passed.
''Part of the problem is that few doctors have experience of treating
frostbite, it's so rare.'' For weeks now he has worn loose slippers to
avoid the pain of constricting footwear. Strong painkillers have had to
be avoided as they aggravate an ulcer he developed during the ordeal.
But time is healing.
During previous weeks Andrew Wilson has walked, in his mind, each inch
of the route that led to his ordeal. As he wanted to try out lightweight
touring bindings he separated from his skiing partner Robin McNeil on
the hill Cairn a Claise but he had a bearing for Carn a Turic.
One of the skins on his skis that allowed him to go slowly in a
straight line came off and he later lost his bearings for Carn a Turic,
so he went back to Cairn a Claise. But the low cloud cover prevented him
from finding the route down.
Using his knowledge and experience he bivouacked down while he had
strength at around 5pm on Saturday, February 18. ''I would brood about
whether, if I had looked a little longer, I would have found my way out,
but I've convinced myself that I did nine out of 10 things right. Now
I'm back at work I'll have less time to think.''
At night he is alone with his wounds, feet which still throb and burn,
the recurring ulcer and a mind that does not rest easy. He is convinced
that an another hour in the open would have killed him. ''At times I
think nothing seems to be going for me -- it's ridiculous I know, I
remain apprehensive about the hills . . . it's the same with life.''
He takes comfort in a closer contact with God. ''Today I'm more
concious of God. I still can't get him centred enough in my life. I'm
now 100% convinced he exists. There is no doubt. There is a God and he
helps you. I only wondered why he answered my prayer. I'm sure there
have been other people stuck in the hills and they too have prayed.''
An answer to the unexplainable is found in the concept of life as the
back of a tapestry. All we see is a lunatic twist of threads, the gaping
holes and difficult knots. God views the pattern from up-top. Wilson's
wife Marion clung to the loose threads during the three days of his
disappearance. Even now she will lie awake in bed thinking: ''What if he
wasn't here?''
Talking in the snug kitchen, Marian Wilson said she knew her prayers
would be answered. ''Either he would be found alive or I would be given
the strength to cope with his death. Today I don't brood about it. You
can't spend your life thinking he might not have survived -- that would
be no kind of life.'' She feels she has walked away with few scars from
the experience.
To Andrew and Marian Wilson the beauty of Scotland's countryside is
God's calling card, and the couple plan to return, beginning gently with
a few walks at Loch Morlich near Aviemore. A family friend, the Rev
Stuart Wadsworth has expressed a desire to return with Andrew to
Braemar.
''I think I will take him. At the back of his mind he wants to see
where God saved someone. He accepts that God was with me in that
bivouac.'' Till then Wilson will continue to wait, but with the
knowledge that he is not longer alone.

AN MP, expressing concern about the danger of growing pressure for
euthanasia, yesterday highlighted the case of a woman peer, Baroness
Wootton -- a supporter of euthanasia -- who had told him she had
''friends in the Lords who know about these things and they have given
me the knock-out pills.''
Lady Wooton, a committed Labour Party activist, died in 1988, aged 91.
Mr Field told the Commons that after she became ill, Lady Wootton had
ended up in a geriatric hospital.
''I thought she would ask me to go to her home to get the pills which
were to kill her . . .
''What was noticeable was, however difficult it got for Barbara in
those last months of her life, she fought with unbelievable
determination to live.
''She didn't ask for those drugs.''
Mr Field said: ''When it came to the crunch, when she wasn't as in
control as she had been previously, other forces took control of Barbara
and she didn't want the end of her life brought forward unnaturally.''
He went on to claim euthanasia was carried out in Britain, citing the
case of King George V's doctor, Lord Dawson, who was ''quite open that
he killed the King -- he did so because he was very anxious that The
Times should carry the story exclusively, rather than the other papers
which he thought were of rather minor concern''.
Earlier, Tory MP Nicholas Winterton attacked calls for legalisation of
euthanasia as ''unnecessary, unethical and repugnant''.
Mr Winterton (Macclesfield) said that decriminalisation would
''discredit'' doctors and undermine society.
He warned that voluntary euthanasia ultimately would become
''compulsory euthanasia''.
Replying to the debate, junior Health Minister Tom Sackville
emphasised that ''the Government remains firmly opposed to euthanasia.''
The Government was concerned ''to ensure that actions which have as
their intention another person's death continue to be unlawful''.

A MAN accused of murder by repeatedly throwing his alleged victim from
a fourth floor window walked free from court yesterday after the Crown
accepted his plea of not guilty.
Mr Raymond Henfry, 29, of Kinclaven Avenue, Drumchapel, denied
murdering Kenneth Syme on New Year's Day in flats at Watchmeal Crescent,
Faifley, Clydebank.
However, he admitted moving a wheelie-bin containing Syme's body from
the scene to lock-up garages at the rear of Faifley Road with intent to
conceal a crime and defeat justice.
Henfry will now give evidence for the Crown at the High Court in
Glasgow against Mr Kenneth McGuire, 35, and Mr Michael Fay, 29, who both
deny Syme's murder.
Henfry will be sentenced for attempting to defeat the ends of justice
at the end of the trial.
The trial judge Lord Osborne was told yesterday that the defence and
prosecution would now have to interview Henfry before the case could
begin.
Lord Osborne told potential jurors to return to court today.

Their cup
of tea
* DRINKING green tea could be good for your health. A study of
Japanese men, who drink large quantities of it, found that those who
consumed more than 10 cups a day had lower cholesterol levels than those
who did not -- and there were signs that they were also less likely to
suffer from liver disease.
But these studies, says a report in the current issue of GP, the
doctors' weekly magazine: ''Do not prove that drinking green tea
protects your heart and liver, but it will be interesting to see the
results of further research.''
Heart aid
* LOW-DOSE aspirin should be given to all patients with angina, say
heart specialists. A study carried out at the John Radcliffe hospital,
Oxford, found that it was preferable to other drugs, being both less
expensive and with less side-effects. Also, a Scandinavian study of 2500
people noted a clear drop in deaths among angina sufferers using
aspirin.
Easing pain
* THOSE who live in constant pain know how debilitating it can be.
Often it's coupled with frustration because sympathy, even from your GP,
for your condition eventually wears out. But a new self-help guide
offers hope. Dr Chris Wells, a consultant in pain relief, has written a
book In Pain?, which explains why people are in constant pain and how it
can lead to loss of self-confidence and self-esteem.
He shows how to break this cycle of despair and how sufferers can take
control of their lives again by using techniques pioneered in Britain by
a team of doctors at the Pain Research Institute, Liverpool. Dr Eric
Ghadiali, a consultant clinical neuro-psychologist at The Walton Centre
in Liverpool has produced two relaxation cassettes to go with the book.
Copies of this package are available at #17.99 (including p/p) from Pain
Pack, PO Box 1, Wirral L47 DD. For further information ring: 0151-632

Expert help
* LABELLED the wonder drug of the 90s for depression, Prozac has
aroused debate and controversy across the country. But, who should take
it? Can it really transform troubled personalities?
These and many more questions are dealt with in Dr Ronald Fieve's
book, Prozac (Thorsons, #5.99). He is an internationally renowed
psychiatrist, and one of the foremost experts on Prozac and its uses.
Dr  Fieve has found it to be as effective as standard
antidepressant drugs, but with the added advantages that it is non-toxic
to the heart, requires only one capsule a day, produces minimal
side-effects and it's virtually impossible to overdose on it. However,
it does have its limitations and these are pointed out clearly.

Today Prince Charles is in Glasgow for the official farewell
presentation to Dr Anne Gilmore, founder and medical director of the
Prince and Princess of Wales hospice.
Ann Shaw reports
MUSICIAN, teacher, university lecturer, GP and medical entrenpeneur:
Dr Anne Gilmore has had a series of careers, though she is better known
to the people of Glasgow as the founder and medical director of The
Prince and Princess of Wales hospice -- the first in the city.
Today she officially says good-bye to the hospice she started some 15
years ago. At a special lunchtime celebration in Carlton Place, Prince
Charles will hand over a portrait of Dr Gilmore painted by artist Linda
Atherton.
She is about to embark on a new career as a pyscho-analyst, combining
that with her present GP practice in Maryhill, thus fulfilling a
lifelong interest in mental health.
Warm hearted and extrovert, those who have known and worked with her
over the years are aware of her phenomenal energy. Unlike many
high-achieving Scots she did not go South or emigrate to more lucrative
pastures -- choosing instead to work in the city among her own folk.
She has a special place in the affections of all those who have come
into contact with her over the years; a doctor and academic who found
herself thrust into the role of business and marketing. For the past 15
years she has been the official front of the hospice, talking, arguing,
cajoling, to raise the #8m needed for the project.
She has not achieved the success she has without a certain amount of
single-mindedness. Behind the charming smile and easy manner is a tough
woman, and Glasgow breeds tough women. Finally the city acknowledged her
efforts. She was named Scotswoman of the Year in 1992 and the following
year received the Lord Provost's Award. She was made an OBE in the
latest New Year Honours' List.
Gilmore comes from a working-class background. Her family were very
politically aware, and the house stocked with lots of books. Her father,
a labourer, swept the floor in the print room of the old Glasgow Herald
in Buchanan Street, but he was also highly intelligent, well-read and a
keen artist, selling his commercial work to the paper.
Her family had a piano and she learnt to play. At 10 years of age her
music teacher put her in for a McFarlane scholarship to the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and she continued there as an external pupil,
later studying full time after Hyndland Secondary School.
A bright all-rounder, Gilmore was good at French, science, gym, music,
maths, and art. Science interested her most, but she seemed to have
considerable natural ability as a musician.
Yet ever since the age of eight she wanted to be a doctor. To her
family it was like announcing she wanted to climb Everest: nobody had
been to university, let alone studied medicine. Instead, she studied
music, trained as a teacher, and taught in some of the toughest schools
in Glasgow. But she still hankered after medicine, and set about
acquiring the necessary entry qualifications through night classes and
correspondence course. She was admitted to Glasgow School of Medicine as
a mature student in her early 20s -- part of the elite band of 10% of
women medical undergraduates. By now she had met and married Stan
Gilmore. Both were determined to further their education, so they sold
their house to pay university fees -- Anne in Glasgow Medical School and
Stan at London University.
She wanted to specialise in psychiatry but found the doors barred.
Having young children, she was unable to put in the on-call night
duties. Instead she specialised in geriatrics, moving into research work
with Professor Fergie Anderson, a world authority on the care of the
elderly, at Glasgow University.
She enjoyed an international career, holding posts as visiting
professor at the universities of Wisconsin, Grenoble, Gothenberg,
Southern California, and Texas and became the senior lecturer in
geriatrics at Glasgow University.
She was acutely aware of the need for a hospice after seeing the way
her own father died in hospital from cancer.
At a party one night in Glasgow she mentioned to an executive from
Black &amp; Whyte whisky that the city needed a hospice. He replied: ''Well,
why don't you start one? Come and see our company.''
Gilmore did and talked to the women in the bottling plant. They
responded with a cheque for #4000. She quickly got together a committee
and the years of hard work began for her and her team of dedicated
volunteers.
Her vision has created a unique hospice for the city. She wanted the
dying to end their days in the ambience of a comfortable hotel, with all
their needs attended to; that the hospice should be within easy reach of
transport so that relatives could visit; that it should be centrally
situated so that patients felt integrated into the community; and that
relatives and carers themselves should receive care and counselling. At
the time these were innovatory concepts. Today they are incorporated in
standard hospice care.
Was it a big decision to leave? Not really, says Dr Gilmore. It's one
she reached a year ago. The hospice is about to embark on the next stage
of its development with the launch of a #1m fund-raising project. If she
was to stay it would take the next 15 years of her life and all her
energy. She decided it was time to step down and let in some fresh
blood, and new ideas.
She is confident that the future of the hospice is in the safe hands
of her successor, Ian Laidlaw, former chief executive of the Scottish
Milk Marketing Board.
And the future? ''I'm proving there is life after the hospice.'' Now,
for the first time in 30 years she says she has time to have a proper
social life, and to indulge her love of travel, particularly to Mexico.
* The Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice are always looking for
volunteers. If you want to help contact the hospice at 73 Carlton Place,
Glasgow, G5 9TD or ring 0141-429 5599.

I AM glad to see that both Val Atkinson and John Curtice accept my
assertion last week that the BBC's figures as given in their election
coverage on the night of April 6 were seriously flawed, although they
attempt to cloak that admission in a considerable amount of special
pleading (April 18).
No psephologist or broadcaster can hide the fact that a substantial
error in the figures trumpeted throughout a national results programme
is anything other than a major problem. That problem was compounded by
the way in which the erroneous figures were used as the source for many
subsequent news stories.
Wriggle as they might, the BBC cannot get round the basic mistake that
was made. Indeed I still have in my possession a written note from one
of the programme production team, given to me as I was leaving the
studio, that confirms the erroneous figures -- and appended to the note
is the indication that these are projections ''with three councils still
to declare''.
The SNP have run the figures without these three councils and the
actual results are a full 4% lower for Labour than the BBC was
maintaining at 3am on Friday, April 7.
Even after virtually all the results were in the BBC were broadcasting
figures based on their false projections at breakfast time on Friday and
even at lunchtime on BBC Network.
The result of this error was not only false BBC coverage -- such is
the BBC's standing that no fewer than five newspapers, including the
Financial Times, were still using the wrong figures to lead their
coverage on Saturday, April 8. As a result a valid election story
focusing on the real fact that the Labour result was nearly 10% down on
their current opinion-poll standing was totally obscured.
The BBC's self-confessed ''few gambles . . . with some of the facts
and figures'' led to misreporting and misrepresentation of the election
results. The BBC is meant to be a reputable and authoritative
broadcasting organisation, not the electoral equivalent of ''Mystic
Meg''. Its task is to report what is happening, and make some cautious
predictions in the light of the actual events, not to build an evening
(and a subsequent day) of political analysis on conjecture and skewed
computer models.
Finally, John Curtice is really clutching at straws when he criticises
me for being 0.5% out in my claims on the election programme. As I was
commenting on the basis of figures supplied by him from his projections,
I think silent embarrassment would have been wiser than public
confrontation. By making the criticism he reinforces the view that he
and his colleagues are still infected with the ''manic inability to
recognise, admit and correct errors'' -- my original contention in last
week's article, and one that now speaks for itself.
But I have to admit to one mistake myself. On the night of April 6 I
relied on Professor Curtice's figures. It is an error I shall not
repeat.

WILLIAM RUSSELL'S less than complimentary profile on Mr Mark Thatcher
(April 17) surely reinforces the argument for the abolition of
hereditary titles.
Even if a fraction of this young man's shenanigans are true the
prospect of his inheriting a baronetcy appalls.
Mr John Major must have been aware of Mr Mark Thatcher's background
when he acceded to his predecessor's demand for her husband's
recognition by the award of a baronetcy. A knighthood would have
sufficed. The Prime Minister must accept the blame for his lack of
foresight.

WHEN Swinburne penned his famous jibe, ''Thou has conquered, oh pale
Galilean, and the world has grown grey in they breath,'' he must surely
have had a premonition of the Christ of Stewart Lamont (April 15).
Most profane dialogues with God transpire to be soliloquies,
anthropomorphic, and extremely self-revealing. Lamont's is no exception.
He talks about various Christs, but never the Christ of the gospels
tradition or the creed. We read about the guru Christ, the guerrilla
Christ. The half-man, half-god Christ; as if He were a centaur. But what
we get is the Iconoclastic Christ of his own psyche. And little that is
traditional survives his frenzy of ecclesiastical vandalism.
Icons are out. The New Testament is out. The virgin birth is out. The
paternity of Joseph is suggested, and the very omniscience of Christ
brought into doubt when He is made the question. There were no miracles,
only sleight of hand or foot (the explanation for walking on water was a
real hoot). Even the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles of St Paul
are out.
Paul, for whom ''to live is Christ and to die is gain'', and who died
by beheading, friendlies, outside the walls of Rome, ''poured out like a
libation'' for the church, is anathematised by this thankless and
apparently loveless deity for ''starting his own brand of religion''.
His crime? A shocking lack of political correctness.
Being a man of his time he foolishly told women of that period to keep
their heads covered and be silent in church, blithly unaware apparently
of the scandal he ws giving to posterity's time-servers.
And through all this we are told that it is advantageous to the
religious to have faith. But faith in what? Certainly not in Lamont's
insipid, anaemic, humanistic parody of the God/Man.
For ''if the trumpet gives forth an uncertain sound, who will prepare
for battle?'' (that man Paul again).
Given the sequel it would not, perhpas, have been too much against the
spirit ofthe Second Commandment had the article's heading ''The Easter
Interview Jesus Christ,'' been judiciously punctuated with a question
and an exclamation mark.

THE question of the rightful ownership ofthe Ghost Shirt in
Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow highlights a dilemma for all museums and
art galleries with religious objects in their collections.
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of paintings and carvings from
the altars of Italian churches and monasteries in museums throughout the
world.
They were removed in various ways from the churches in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries and sold to aristocrats and museums; the
beautiful painting of the annunciation by Botticelli in Kelvingrove is
one such altarpiece.
It was sold, but where does one draw the line between selling,
presentation, and the spoils of war?
Do Christians pray in front of a painting in an art gallery that was
originally a church? No, because it has been removed from its proper
setting and is regarded as art.
Therefore the Ghost Shirt in Kelvingrove should remain there as it is
divorced from its social setting, its country of origin, and, while its
religious associations are acknowledged, it can be regarded as being
representative of its people and as an example of ethnic art.

THERE is much to commend in the article by the EIS Deputy General
Secretary, Fred Forrester (Education Herald, April 18).
Of course consultation should not be ''loaded'' -- to use Mr
Forrester's words. By the same token we should not start off by setting
ourselves implacably against a merger of the Scottish Examination Board
(SEB) and the Scottish Vocational Education Council (Scotvec).
The trend in education is towards the abolition of artificial
divisions and the integration and ease of movement between the various
types of provisions. Rigidifying the SEB into a Schools Qualifications
Authority and Scotvec into a Further and Higher Education Qualifications
Authority would surely be a retrograde step.
Mr Forrester is right to call for a wider debate, and to draw
attention to the cultural differences and logistical difficulties which
would beset the proposed SEB/Scotvec merger. These are real, and need to
be addressed, but they are not reasons to rule out the merger option in
principle.

STUC general secretary Campbell Christie was involved in a bizarre
mistake in Perth when his name was put out on the town's Pub Watch
scheme as someone who had caused a rumpus and had refused to pay for
food and drink.
An extremely angry Mr Christie said yesterday that he was astonished
at the suggestion, which was: ''Totally untrue. Totally false.'' Perth's
pubs have a pager system so that if anyone causes a disturbance in a
pub, his or her description can be flashed to other premises to warn
them.
It appears that such a warning was put out by someone allegedly
working at the Stakis-owned City Mills Hotel.
An investigation was ordered by Stakis's chief executive and later a
company spokesman said that reports of the alleged incident had been
misrepresented, and that Mr Christie had not refused to pay for drinks
or food, or cause any disturbance.
There had been a function at the hotel, hosted by civil service
unions, which Mr Christie attended on Tuesday evening.
Mr Christie said he had only one glass of lager at the function before
leaving to have dinner with a group of foreign trade union officials. He
then went to his hotel room to watch some football on the television.
After being asked about the Pub Watch message, Mr Christie said:
''This is completely untrue. I was never asked by the hotel, at any
time, to meet any bill for food or drink, and the first time I became
aware of the matter was the following morning when approached by the
media.
''This statement (the Pub Watch message) is wholly false and this is
confirmed not only by myself and other guests but by the hosts of the
function, who were responsible for funding the entire reception.
''The hotel have stated that the pager message was erroneous and have
apologised unreservedly for their action and for any embarrassment
caused to me.'' Mr Christie has also consulted a lawyer.
The Stakis spokesman added: ''The company deeply regrets and
apologises unreservedly for any embarrassment this may have caused.''

I HAVE recently returned from leading a three-week cricket tour of
India by the West District's under-19 squad. We had a good time, and the
lads have returned better cricketers and better people.
Air India managed to transport us from London to Delhi, to Bombay, to
Goa, to Bombay, to Delhi and back to London -- some 21,000 kilometres --
without major mishap and with unfailing courtesy.
On our arrival back at Heathrow we had to transfer to the British
Airways Shuttle flight which we had booked and paid for in January. You
can imagine my surprise and concern when we were told that there were
insufficient seats available on the flight.
Apparently members of the BA Executive Club had turned up in
greater-than-expected numbers and they have a right to walk on to any
Shuttle. So much for the rights of those who book and pay in advance.
I'm sure we cannot be the only ones to experience such inconvenience.
It must be time for BA to review their arrangements.

THE day of July 25, 1991, will haunt me for the rest of my life. My
manager told me that I was redundant and that I had to leave
immediately. I had been employed by General Accident insurance on the
underwriting and staff-training side for 27 years. Now I was on the dole
at the age of 44 in the middle of a recession.
Stunned but unbowed, I launched an intensive job search . . . 15
months and 500 job applications later I was still unemployed and feeling
very ill.
Employers kept telling me I was too old or too experienced for them.
(Too experienced means too old.) Eventually, a small local employer gave
me a job, albeit at a lower salary and lesser conditions than my
previous job. However, I was grateful.
During my long term of unemployment, I had become disillusioned with
employers and very ill with depression and anxiety. My mental condition
became worse and my new employer eventually had to release me. I was
diagnosed as suffering from severe reactive depression caused by my
initial redundancy in 1991.
I am still unemployed and ill -- and may never work again.
My wife Eileen and 15-year-old son Steven have suffered greatly.
Eileen has been very ill with anxiety and Steven has been left with
major psychological and physical problems. He played truant from school
and ran away from home because he fell so far behind due to illness. His
life has been permanently scarred.
And I feel it is all due to me having my career prematurely severed.
This year I was invited to join the Campaign Against Age
Discrimination in Employment by Philip Walker, its founder and chairman.
It is a UK-wide campaign and is growing quickly. It lobbies MPs and has
presented petitions to the Prime Minister. The aim is to get legislation
passed in the UK to outlaw all forms of age discrimination in
employment.
America, Canada, and various European countries have effective
legislation. However, the Conservative Party is interested only in a
voluntary code. Such codes are virtually worthless -- toothless tigers.
Labour has recently announced that it favours legislation and will
pass anti-discrimination laws if elected next time.
Paddy Ashdown, Lib-Dem leader, discussed the matter with me last week
and has promised a full statement soon. I am confident he will support
legislation.
The subject of age discrimination will be raised as an issue by me at
the Perth and Kinross by-election. More than two million people
currently suffer from age discrimination in employment. In the near
future, half of the working population will be more than 45 years old
and will be potential candidates for age discrimination.
Any employee over the age of 50 is now regarded as fair game for early
retiral or redundancy. If you lose your job after 50 you have little
chance of gaining permanent full-time employment. Even if you are under
50, it is becoming very difficult to find an interested employer.
Those who suffer most belong to the age groups 16-24 and 45-65.
Discrimination affects young and old alike. Many school leavers and
graduates can't find work.
Employers only want people in the 25-38 age band. They want the twin
benefits of experience and youth. They suck you dry and then discard you
on the unemployment scrapheap. This helps increase profits for
shareholders and owners.
Lives are destroyed, careers terminated, serious ill-health developed,
and families torn apart because of ageism. It has to be stopped now
before it destroys our society. Legislation would help to create a level
playing field in employment and would deter many employers from
practising rampant ageism.
CAADE offers a counselling service via its sister organisation, the 45
Club Charity. It has helped over 5000 people annually to recover from
the ravages of unemployment by phone or letter counselling.
It costs #5 to join CAADE plus a voluntary contribution if membership
of the 45 Club Charity is needed. It is money well spent; believe me, I
know.

AN English council is celebrating a deal to export heather to
Scotland.
A spokesman for New Forest District Council in Hampshire said
yesterday: ''It's one up from selling coals to Newcastle but our heather
is deemed to be the best for the job in question.''
Forestry Commission spokesman, Mr Harry Oran, said the deal had been
struck when a Scottish fish farmer approached the commission seeking
English heather for use in his water-purifying filters.
''There is no significant difference between English heather and
Scottish heather -- they are both from the same strain of Culluna
Vulgaris,'' said Mr Oran.
''The only difference is that our heather in the New Forest is lowland
heather, so it is far easier to get to.
''I've worked in Scotland and the north of England so I know how much
heather there is around and there is certainly no shortage of it up
there.
''But it would just be easier to harvest it from a place like the New
Forest.''
He added that the fish farmer also imports heather from the north of
Yorkshire.

IN your report, Episcopal overtures go to Kirk (April 14), the Rev
Sheilagh Kesting is quoted as saying that opposition to bishops in the
Church of Scotland was an emotional reaction. May I say that I consider
this gratuitous observation to be an insult to the ordinary Presbyterian
in the pew?
The conclusions being offered by those who have been engaged in these
ecumenical conversations are once again, as in the past, the
self-fulfilling thoughts of narrow-minded enthusiasts. They seem to
believe that if their views are repeated often enough these will
eventually be accepted as truth.
May I suggest that when next holding an ecumenical gathering they give
more than passing thought to this quotation from the text, Presbyterians
Awake, by Sir Alexander Johnston: ''If Christ returned tomorrow, would
He be impressed by the sight of church leaders sitting in cosy parlours
discussing fine points of theology in the interests of ecumenism, or
would He tell them to get out and preach the gospel to the world at
large?''

PROVOST Ian Miller of Bearsden was only partially right when he
criticised the Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang, and the Tory Party
chairman, Sir Michael Hirst.
The truth is that Prime Minister John Major and the whole Conservative
Party are guilty of destroying the infrastructure of local government by
their ill-conceived policies.
There may be some genuine Tories with good in their hearts but they
are a tiny minority in the vast jungle of self-opinionated greedy people
abounding in the influential centre core of the Tory hierarchy.
The humiliating defeat suffered by the Tories in Scotland is what they
rightly deserved. It is obvious that even in a place like Bearsden there
is no hiding place for the Tories with their discredited ideology.
I am sure the East Dunbartonshire council will not miss the outgoing
Tory councillors. At last the people of Bearsden and Milngavie have
woken up and pronounced their verdict on the Conservatives at the ballot
box.
If anyone has to resign it should be John Major and his rotten
Government.

I WAS very pleased to see your article, ''Peace of a fast flowing

It would seem that Stewart Lamont does not believe what the Bible says
nor does he know Jesus personally.
Jesus would not speak in this flippant way and He certainly would not
say the things in this article because so many of them are untrue.
This ''interview'' could have been a great opportunity to tell people
the truth about who Jesus is and to let them know the joy of the Easter

THE disposal of clinical waste allegedly mixed with hospital refuse is
not an isolated incident.
Responsibility for disposal of the waste lies with the producer of the
waste. He contracts a company to transport it to a licensed site where
it is dumped, usually in a landfill site. Tracking of the true contents
of the waste is a loose arrangement with many loads being described as
sludge or muck. Little or no physical checking of the load takes place
from producer to landfill. It is easy to see how the refuse bag from the
hospital was disposed of so simply.
Clinical waste, however, can only be accepted by a site licensed to
accept ''special waste''. Glasgow has such a site and over 40 local
authorities in England and Scotland bring their special waste to
Glasgow. They do not allow it within their boundaries because special
waste is described in the environmental protection Act as being
''dangerous to life'' and they want to protect their citizens from this
danger.
Day by day we do not know what is really being dumped at these sites.
Neither do the site managers. The combination of normal industrial waste
mixed with more dangerous waste could be happening every day. The
current system has no way of knowing.
In Glasgow these sites are policed by the Environmental Health
Department, arguably the most inept and complacent of any local
government department. The policing is weak and ineffective.
Similar incidents to the hospital waste mix-up will continue to occur
until tighter controls from producer to landfill are introduced.
Meantime Glasgow welcomes dangerous waste from all over the country to
the detriment of all who live here.

LABOUR deputy leader John Prescott went on a charm offensive at the
congress yesterday.
He promised delegates that a Labour Government would end competitive
compulsory tendering, bring in a minimum wage, work for full employment,
and bring the railways back into state control.
Much of it had been said before but Labour hoped that bringing all the
strands together and confirming them in a positive manner would woo the
trade union support.
His speech was welcomed by many of the 470 delegates, although only
about half of the hall joined in the standing ovation.
Particularly welcomed was the pledge to abolish compulsory competitive
tendering, which is threatening the jobs of thousands of local-authority
workers.
Mr Prescott said: ''Of course we support fair competition based on
quality, on skills, on innovation, and excellence. But we reject the
competition forced on our public services by the dogma of compulsory
competitive tendering which leads to lower pay and less employment
rights.''
He also announced that he was setting up a regional policy commission
to report within a year. It would draw up a strategy to stimulate
employment, training, and investment.
It would identify the priorities for action and encourage
public/private partnerships. People from unions, the business world, and
academics would be asked to take part.
There were soothing words also for unionists suspicious of the
modernising trends within Labour. Mr Prescott deliberately drew
parallels between today and the Labour Government of 1945 which is
remembered as the great reforming government which tackled unemployment
and brought in the welfare state and the National Health Service.
He reiterated that Labour believed in a statutory minimum wage but
again disappointed some by giving no indication of the level at which it
might be set.
When asked why he had not mentioned the vexed question of the reform
of Labour's Clause 4, he said the media simply had not recognised the
words in his speech, as the aims he had spelled out were all about the
new Clause 4.

IF you go into a laboratory belonging to one of our major drug
companies you are in for a big surprise, at least if your memories of
science studies, like mine, involve Bunsen burners and flaky asbestos
mats. The workbenches of today's scientists are remarkably free of items
of any kind. Instead, all the action takes place inside fume cupboards
fitted out with the latest equipment, and several dials monitor the
level of potentially harmful emissions.
Computers and robots take much of the repetitive drudge out of
everyday tasks such as filling containers with samples for analysis.
This leaves time for more interesting work and collaboration with
colleagues.
Often teams of scientists work on different aspects of the same
project, which must be more fulfilling than working on your own for
possibly weeks on end. Advances in communications technology such as the
Internet and video-conferencing has also enabled geographic boundaries
to be crossed.
Science seems much more exciting than when I was studying it at school
and university 10 years ago. Maybe because the economic climate has been
so depressed in recent years that those companies not producing
innovative and commercially viable products have gone to the wall.
Breakthroughs in knowledge, particularly in life sciences, with
greater understanding of human genetics, has provided a great
opportunity for scientific research and drug development. However, it is
not just the traditional science-based industries that are benefiting
from advances in science and technology but other areas, such as
education, retailing, financial services and crime prevention.
It strikes me there is a case for some positive public relations for
science. The proportion of young people gaining an advanced pass in each
of the main maths and science subjects rose during the 1980s and early
1990s, but the increases were well below those for English or geography,
and were far short of the average for all subjects.
Everything is far from rosy at the higher education level. While the
proportion of first degree science and engineering graduates is forecast
to be maintained over the period 1988/89 to 1996/97, the rate of growth
is expected to vary depending on the subject.
TO DATE the fastest growth rate has been in subjects allied to
medicine, including pharmacology and nursing, for which the number of
first degree graduates is expected to triple. Mathematical sciences are
also showing greater than average growth due to the large rise in the
number of computer studies graduates. However, a cause for concern must
be the less than average growth experienced in biological and physical
sciences, engineering, and technology.
For a long time science has been the poor relation, at least in terms
of student perception, to a career in the media or financial services.
But the service sector has been going through tougher times, with fewer
jobs created and less job security.
This provides an ideal opportunity to attract people into a career in
science and technology. Politicians are generally not strong on what's
become known as ''the vision thing'', but to its credit the Government,
at least in the form of David Hunt, the Cabinet Minister for Science and
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, does appear to recognise that
science, engineering, and technology are vital to the UK's future
economic prosperity against the background of increasingly competitive
markets.
In 1995/96, just over #1200m will be spent by the Government on
science, with small increases in the annual budgets for research
councils and institutions such as the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council. However, given that resources are limited and
that, in any case, no one country can hope to do everything possible in
science, there has been a sensible attempt to focus on those areas which
may provide the best opportunities for the future. Many of these
opportunities cut across subjects and include the production of
wealth-creating products such as vaccines, designer oils, foods, and
cosmetics from plants.
Although it is early days yet, there are signs that a more structured
approach to R&amp;D is taking place in some establishments. Britain has a
long history of producing world-class scientists. Providing the
scientific base is continually enriched, both academically and
financially, it gives us a vital competitive advantage.
There is no future for Britain in producing highly labour-intensive
commodity goods, because we cannot hope to compete against newly
industrialised countries which employ cheap labour -- often at
one-quarter of the cost of a similar worker in the UK. Against this
background our future prosperity depends on our ability to provide
products and services which have a high technological input.

THE persistent weakness of sterling this year is threatening to upset
the economic applecart just when the Government, desperately in need of
a boost, might have expected to start reaping some benefit from the
delicate balancing act being performed by Steady Eddie George and Canny
Ken Clarke. Last September Governor George talked Chancellor Clarke into
raising interest rates to slow down the economy which was beginning to
show signs of growing too rapidly for its own good. Rates were raised
again in December and February, and there are now signs that the economy
has slowed to a more sustainable pace. A survey this week showed that
business leaders are being won over by the Government's strategy.
Financial returns testify to the health of corporate Britain -- in stark
contrast to the absence of a feel-good factor among the general public.
Disposable incomes have been squeezed by two years of hefty tax
increases to restore order to the public finances which were severely
stretched by the prolonged recession. Pay rises have been held in check,
mortgage rates are rising again, and inflation is threatening to return
from the dead. Manufacturers are enjoying the fruits of the pound's
creeping devaluation since Britain left Europe's exchange rate mechanism
more than two-and-a-half years ago, but retailers are struggling to make
headway. The National Lottery and foreign travel are the flavours of the
moment.
Politically, the Government could hardly be in worse trouble. Just
when a new-style Labour leader is increasing his party's natural
constituency, life-long Conservatives are on strike. Some are defecting
to opposition parties, but most of them are staying at home every time
there is a chance to protest at what is widely perceived to be an
accident-prone Government which has long outlived its usefulness. As
every schoolboy knows, Harold Wilson said that a week is a long time in
politics. He was the sixties Prime Minister who presided over a large
devaluation of the pound (in your pocket) and yet came within a whisker
of holding on to power in the 1970 General Election after a dose of
fiscal rectitude from his Chancellor, Roy Jenkins. In the event he had
to wait another four years to return to Downing Street. The point is
that public opinion is fickle, much more so now than it was 25 years
ago.
Even more volatile are the foreign exchange markets. The dollar is
being crucified by the might of the Japanese yen and the German mark,
and the pound is being dragged down with it. The Government's abject
failure to sell any of its economic achievements -- and there are some
-- to the public is not helping either. Yesterday sterling notched up a
fresh all-time low (as measured by its trade-weighted index) on the
world currency markets. It has lost over 5% of its international value
this year. The beneficiary will be the manufacturing sector, but the
feel-good factor is likely to take yet another beating because rates
will have to rise sooner rather than later to compensate.
A populist Government would simply turn its back on the inflationary
implications of the latest devaluation. Before the electorate has the
last word on Mr Major's tenure of power, Mr Clarke may have the scope
for some tax cuts and perhaps some extra public spending as fiscal
pressures ease. But the opportunity will have to be exercised
responsibly. The Government's one genuine merit is its dedication in the
battle against inflation. It may bury Mr Major and his colleagues, but
without it the next election would be no contest at all.

RAIL networks face possible industrial action because of ScotRail's
attempts to discipline a train crew member for wearing an ear-ring.
The railwayman from Airdrie, who works at the Yoker depot in Glasgow,
has been told he faces disciplinary action. His union, the RMT, is
threatening to ballot members for industrial action if ScotRail goes
ahead, claiming that it has never had proper talks with ScotRail over
its tough new dress and appearance code.
RMT represents ticket-sellers and other station staff but the dress
code also applies to drivers, even though they rarely meet the public.
About a third of train drivers wear the tie of their union Aslef and
they have been told that they could also be disciplined.
Aslef's general secretary, Mr Lew Adams, said there had even been
cases of staff being criticised by management for having bulging
pockets.
He claimed that such ''bully- boy tactics'' were an attempt to soften
up the staff to make them less resistant to privatisation.
The RMT general secretary, Mr Jimmy Knapp, said the softening-up
process was brought in by management as if, were they to make profits
out of privatisation, it could only be done by attacking the wages and
conditions of his members.
Mr Pat O'Connor, Scottish secretary of Aslef, said: ''They've even
been telling women members what colour of tights to wear. They say they
can discipline you for wearing your hair too long, or even for wearing
it too short.
''Ear-rings up to 25mm are permitted on women. Anyone with a tattoo is
banned from wearing short-sleeved shirts. It's a nonsense and, we
believe, is blatant discrimination.
''Our drivers are proud to wear their union tie, which is certainly
nothing like as garish as the new ScotRail tie which has what they
officially call the woosh design on it. If they try to discipline our
drivers over the ties, then there is talk of industrial action being
taken.''
Mr O'Connor said the actions of ScotRail's management had
deteriorated. He claimed that one Scottish manager, when hearing a
disciplinary action, had a model of Pinocchio on his desk, and would say
that Pinocchio's nose was growing if he did not believe what he was
being told.
During the STUC's debates yesterday, Mr Knapp was backed by delegates
unanimously in his call for an incoming Labour Party, within its first
term of office, to bring the entire railway industry back into public
ownership and control.
He said though that the battle over the railways was just beginning.
''Our objectives are clear. First to frustrate and defeat the
privatisation process. Second to win support for a re-unified publicly
owned network.
''One of the things we have got to do is to fight this vicious and
untrue ideology that everything public is flawed, and that it has to be
private to be good.
''We have to fight that. It is an insult to a lot of good people.''
Mr O'Connor said there were grave dangers, if the Government did not
guarantee funding for Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive beyond
1996, that services could be cut, lines closed, bus services reduced,
and jobs lost.

WELL into April the snow still lies on Scottish mountain tops and
clogs high gullies, a reminder of winter's severities and of the risks
facing those who venture into these exposed and isolated areas.
Avalanche is one of the recurring hazards for walkers, climbers, and
skiers in the hills in winter and early spring. Attitudes have changed.
Once it was complacently assumed, in spite of the evidence, that
avalanching was a feature of Alpine slopes unlikely to be encountered at
home. This is not the case, as statistics and the evidence of the past
winter show. People are swept down our hillsides every year, and some
die entombed. There is reason to think that the tally has been reduced
and lives saved thanks to the work of the avalanche warning system,
which for the past seven years has issued advance notice of the
estimated avalanche danger in three of our most popular sporting areas.
This service, which is Government funded, is now to be subjected to an
inquiry into whether it gives value for money. The announcement that a
committee is to be set up for the purpose has raised fears that the
scheme is at risk and may be abandoned. This must not happen. The
warning system is not free of criticism, some of it justified. It is not
comprehensive. Avalanches occur wherever there is heavy snow on hills,
not just in Glencoe, Lochaber, and the Cairngorms. Better ways may have
to be found to disseminate information. In some quarters there is even a
certain resentment -- some outdoor interests promoting safety in the
hills suspect that the avalanche service is financed at their expense.
It is true that avalanches are not the only danger. But this is no
reason for cutting off a valuable service. We should be thinking of
expansion and improvement rather than reduction. Former mountain rescue
leader Hamish McInnes puts it bluntly: ''They will be writing out death
warrants if it is withdrawn'' -- and his words cannot lightly be
ignored.
But in the last resort no warning system can be foolproof. Numbered
among the avalanche victims are not only the unsuspecting leisure
walkers caught unawares but experienced veterans who know the hills and
can measure the risks. In the end, the onus for reading the signs and
taking care falls on the individual climber or skier. A cursory scanning
of the weather forecast is insufficient preparation for a trip to the
hills when there is snow about. Some basic clues to avalanche risk are
easily found, given knowledge of recent winds and weather patterns and a
reasonable familiarity with snowcraft. The more knowledge that is
available the safer our hills will be, and the avalanche warning system
offers an important contribution to that end. As if on cue, this week's
snow flurries have underlined the message.

IF YOU thought John Major had problems being seen by Scottish
television audiences, consider poor Bill Clinton. The garrulous bubba
wants to talk -- US TV audiences don't want to listen.
The President's difficulties have nothing to do with the courts, or
attempts to interfere with elections; everything to do with the average
American's constitutional right to sit-coms.
On Tuesday night, when Clinton attempted to broadcast live to the
nation via a White House press conference, two of the three main US
networks preferred, on mature judgment, to show hit comedies.
Cruel observers might deduce from this that the President can't even
cut the mustard as a clown, but there's more to it than that. ABC said
it had made an ''independent news judgment'' in choosing not to air
Clinton's conference; NBC said it made decisions on a ''case-by-case''
basis. Both meant, quite simply, that the most powerful man in the world
wasn't newsworthy.
The White House insisted it had gone to some lengths not to
''oversell'' Clinton's appearance, adding that he has been careful to
avoid overexposure, having given only three primetime press conferences
hitherto.
Even so, a White House spokesman added mournfully, ''We fully expect
to be at least half as interesting as Home Improvement.''
Given that a 30-second ad on the half-hour ABC show costs $350,000,
and $230,000 on the equivalent NBC slot, the networks didn't see things
that way. They run eight such spots every 30 minutes, and know full well
that a Clinton appearance would never command such prices. His pratfalls
and domestic problems are no match for those of the professionals.
These are changed days. When Franklin Roosevelt gave his fireside
chats, a nation was hypnotised. JFK, as even monochrome footage shows,
was a television natural. Nixon, in office or out, could command huge
audiences for his sweating evasions and barefaced lies. And Reagan was,
of course, the original plug-in-and-play ''Great Communicator''.
But there's a lesson here, even if you do not accept that what happens
in America today is Britain's inevitable fate tomorrow. Media are
proliferating everywhere; there is more news available, and available
more quickly, than ever before. It pours forth around the clock and
around the globe from television, radio and on-line services. You can
find out almost anything, at almost any time.
But so what? Rather than revolutionising democracy (as advertised),
technology has contrived to make politics even less interesting than
before, if such a thing were possible. In Britain, party political
broadcasts are shuffled around the schedules like road safety adverts.
Parliament is televised but who watches, who cares? MPs castigate the
press for no longer covering debates in full, but we all know -- because
we once saw the pictures -- how often the chamber of the Commons is
full.
Clinton's fate has a lot to do with the confusion between news and its
ratings; between what matters and who watches. ABC was telling the White
House, in so many words, that whatever the President had to say better
be damned important before the network would interrupt its schedules.
And what could be more important than America's best-loved TV show?
There's no cause to mock. In Britain, news and current affairs are
coming under similar pressures. With all strands of broadcasting exposed
to the pressure of competition for ratings, politics has become, to all
intents and purposes, a fringe activity; a minority interest for
late-night or Sunday afternoon viewing.
One or two sacred cows aside (Panorama, ironically, being one)
politics in Britain has been reduced to election specials in the small
hours, a quick interview on the green at Westminster, a ritual exchange
at Prime Minister's Questions, or a 20-second report from the front door
at Number 10 -- ''and back to you, Trevor, in the studio''.
Analysis survives on Newsnight or Radio Four, yet, important as these
are, they amount to no more than coterie broadcasting; news for those in
the news; knowledge for those in the know. Elsewhere the mass
communication of ideas and arguments is being driven out by market
forces.
If politicians complain, they might ask who brought about such a
situation in the first place. But how sincere, in any case, is their
grumbling? How many MPs prefer a real debate to a sound-bite? Which
party knows in its heart that policies always matter more than
presentation? Competing in a world driven by ratings, the professionals
are happy to sell themselves like haemorrhoid ointment.
It is, though, a game they can't win. During the last US presidential
elections it was calculated that the average sound-bite had grown
shorter. When Bush won, snatches of babble were running at 25 to 30
seconds apiece; when Clinton won, gibberish clips were down to between
10 and 15 seconds. In TV's version of politics, more meant less.
Democracy functions, so they tell us, when people understand what they
vote for. When even the President of the United States can't get a word
in edgeways, what chance have people with something really important to
say?

THERE seems little point to me, with due deference to the provost of
Bearsden and Milngavie, Ian Miller, in calling upon Sir Michael Hirst to
resign as chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party. There seems every
good reason for all patriotic Scots Tories to take charge of their own
party.
Micky Hirst is a friend of mine; he is a quite tireless worker on
behalf of the Conservative cause, a man with a mind of his own, a fine
speaker, and an honest guy. I wish we had more like him.
Yet he knows my view; party chairman should be elected by the rank and
file, those who cough up the subscriptions, not appointed by the Prime
Minister. If he was a candidate I would vote for him. As long as I, and
others like me, do not have that opportunity, his authority is
diminished.
The labyrinthine structure of the Conservative Party, UK-wide, would
do credit to the Supreme Soviet, the Orange Order, or the Ku-Klux-Klan.
There are special sections, a national union, women's bits,
differentiation between voluntary and professional bodies, YCs -- at
least a score of them at the last census -- business groups, affiliated
associations, and gentlemen's clubs. All have the right to do this,
that, or the other, provided, of course, they eventually do what they
are told.
In Scotland this confusion of who is leading who where is contained in
the setting up of a party organisation, those are Micky's men and women,
as well as the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association which
actually organises the annual Scottish conference. Well, sort of.
As a former vice-president of SCUA, I can testify that the decisions
about where the conference will be held, which hotel will be used, and
what hymns will be sung at the opening service are all left to the
executive. What appears on the actual agenda is heavily influenced by
Government Ministers.
The reason one discovers a string of motions beginning: ''Conference
congratulates HM Government on saving the nation, the NHS or the whale
etc'' is because the reps of that self-same Government run the show.
Constituencies know that critical motions are destined for a darkened
room.
I well remember being told that the late Alick Buchanan-Smith was not
going to be permitted to move a motion because ''he had been a real pain
to the Government in the Commons over the past year''. If anyone doubts
the accuracy of that recollection I will happily give the time, place,
and author of the words.
A wag once dubbed SCUA as the Scottish Collection of Unpolitical
Adults and it seems to be heading that way again.
For party loyalty is all. Oh no it's not.
That kind of loyalty is pretending to move the troops around from the
bunker when they have disappeared completely from the battlefield. That
kind of blind thinking is like considering whether or not to pull down
the Berlin Wall after the East Germans have poured through it.
Any moment now, presuming we are ever going to contest the Perth and
Kinross by-election, we will receive from Central Office an exhortation
to raise the blue banner in the hills and dales. ''If we all stand
together, victory will be ours,'' will be the cry.
Utter baloney. If we all stood together in single file, those actually
prepared to go out to fight, we might make it from one end of Princes
Street to the other. Great Western Road would be quite beyond us.
A good friend of Mr John Godfrey, the selected sacrifice, might tell
him to bide where he works just at the moment and persuade one of the
local councillors to stand in his place. I cannot believe the result
would be worse.
The policies have to change. Not just the presentation, the policies.
Nobody voted for VAT on domestic fuel, for other tax increases, hardly
a soul wants water privatisation, gey few Scots are going to back
compulsory ID cards, they fear the railway changes will be disastrous,
and they believe the quality of life is not just about money. Public
services do matter.
So if Provost Ian Miller is wrong in calling for Micky to fall on his
sword, Councillor John Young is absolutely right in demanding the party
listens more to grass-root opinion. That process could start at the
party conference in Glasgow next month.
There could be a session, preferably with the PM present and able to
respond, where the delegates were invited to air their grouses.
Is that such a revolutionary notion? It would be much more productive
than another set-piece speech with the delegates acting as extras for
the television cameras. Why, the party hierarchy might be given some new
ideas.
After that, conference could debate whether the chairman should be
elected or appointed. Any chance of a free vote, chaps? No, I did not
think so.
Instead there will be a series of Ministers telling the world that
everything is fine, happy days will be here again, good times are just
around the corner.
I will not be attending. A spoonful of syrup is just not enough to
make the medicine go down anymore. At 11% in the Scottish polls the
doomsday scenario is written on the next page.
For we saw what really lies around the corner last week. Union bosses
taking on a Labour Government, screaming teachers abusing Minister
Blunkett, calls for strikes in schools, an end to all testing,
Labour-controlled councils spending like there is no tomorrow.
If that happens the nation may take a long time to forgive the Tories.

Pen portrait: Benedict Brogan reports on an English MP's robust
approach as he enters the world of Scottish power politics
TERRY DICKS had planned to slip quietly into the world of Scottish
politics, but with views like his, discretion is impossible. The London
Tory has been appointed to the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee and
despite a promise to listen and learn, a man with his strength of
opinion cannot be expected to keep quiet for long.
Dicks is remarkable not for his opinions, but for his robustness in
expressing them. Other politicians may support capital punishment and
hate immigration, but few would dare say it with such politically
incorrect zest. He has, Dicks says, always known when to call a spade a
shovel.
His Parliamentary career is built on saying out loud what most of us
would never admit even to thinking. Football hooligans? Birch 'em.
Immigrants living off the state? Stick 'em in a banana boat and send 'em
home. IRA terrorists? Don't shoot to kill, just don't shoot to miss.
In person Dicks is more endearing than his track record. He has a
hesitant smile and an openness which suggests his views, however
extreme, are no more than an honest representation of what most people
in his marginal working class constituency -- Hayes and Harlington in
West London -- believe. He is from the populist school of politics,
where simple solutions often make frightening sense.
Dicks, 58, was born with a mild form of cerebral palsy, which left him
with a weak right side but didn't stop him from playing rugby and
football. With roots in working class Bristol, he is an understandable
enemy of the moneyed Tory Establishment.
His appointment to the Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs is
not big news in itself. He is not the first English Tory to be roped in
by the Government to make up a majority. But unlike his predecessors,
whose impact has been for the most part unnoticeable, Dicks can be
counted on to get involved. He doesn't understand what all the fuss has
been about.
He was genuinely surprised to be told by one reporter that his views
would find no support in Scotland. ''Why? It doesn't matter where you
are. People don't like to see child rapists or joyriders getting away
with light sentences. To suggest that my views are not in accord with
the views of the people in Scotland seems strange.''
Football is one of his greatest passions, and hooligans among his
greatest hates. He is quick to point out that his remarks about Scottish
football hooligans in 1988 -- he called them pigs and suggested they
should be birched -- could have applied to English ones as well. He is
also a Celtic supporter. In 1964 he was a student at the Catholic
Workers College at Oxford (he is a Roman Catholic convert). He organised
the college's football team, which, being poor, had to play without a
strip.
Dicks wrote to Celtic and the club answered by sending him a supply of
shirts.
His views on the arts are typical. Behind the attacks on fat men in
tights singing in foreign languages, the question he asks is a
legitimate one: why should a farmer in Aberdeenshire subsidise operas
attended by the elite in London?
Although a Unionist by inclination, he is open-minded about Scotland's
position in the United Kingdom. ''I'm a great believer in what people
want. If there were a referendum with an overriding movement to
devolution I wouldn't oppose it. If that's what a majority of Scots want
then so be it. But I don't see any benefits for Scotland from
independence.''
As far as his role on the committee is concerned, he insists he is
there to learn from his colleagues. ''I see nothing outrageous or
unusual for somebody English to sit on the Scottish affairs committee.
That's why we are a UK parliament. But what would be wrong would be if I
kept looking at Scotland's problems through the eyes of an Englishman.
''I've got a lot to learn from my Scottish colleagues both Labour and
Tory. If I feel I have something to say I'll say it. I'm not looking for
any trouble.''

SCOTTISH members of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of
Women Teachers warned yesterday that unless resources were made
available to cut class sizes in Scotland, they might follow the example
of their English and Welsh colleagues and take industrial action.
Mr Tino Ferri, a Scottish member of the union's national executive,
said that pressure would be increased ''quite robustly'' if the
Government's ''sympathetic noises'' did not produce more resources.
The Scottish annual meeting at the beginning of next month was likely
to provide an opportunity for members to thrash out a policy, he said.
Mr Ferri's warnings followed a vote by the union's conference in
Eastbourne for ballots to sanction action which could see pupils
withdrawn from classes on a rota basis. The vote was the latest in
almost two weeks of teachers' conferences south of the Border which have
resulted in all the main English and Welsh teaching unions preparing for
ballots on industrial action of different forms this summer or in the
next school session.
The National Union of Teachers is to ballot on a one-day national
strike as well as supporting local action on classes above 30. However,
the NAS/UWT plans to strike only ''if all else fails''.
Mr Fred Forrester, the depute general secretary of the Educational
Institute of Scotland, Scotland's largest teaching union, said the
union's national council would this weekend debate a motion calling for
a campaign to be launched on the size of classes in Scotland.
The EIS wants the limit for classes in primary schools and the first
and second year of secondary schools to be reduced from 33 to 25, while
the maximum in third and fourth year should drop from 30 to 20. The
limit for practical classes should be 15 instead of the 20, and
composite classes should be less than the current figure of 20,
according to the EIS.
Labour's spokeswoman on education, Mrs Maria Fyfe, refused to commit
her party to an increase in resources for cutting the size of classes.

Ernie Walker is recalled to put Scottish football back on track. Jimmy
Reid explains why he believes the former SFA secretary is precisely the
man for the job: 'In my opinion, he was the best football administrator
the UK has known in the post-war years.'
He has won for Scotland a respect out of all proportion to our size
and clout
MY school days are recalled by memories of Rangers playing Moscow
Dynamo. I slept all night outside the stadium to get a ticket, and
plunked school to see the game. The only time I ever plunked it. Honest,
Miss.
The end of the war for me was when Jackie Husband flighted the ball to
Willie Waddell, who stabbed it into the middle, and Jimmy Delaney poked
it in the net, and we had won the Victory International against England.
My dad held me aloft and found it a strain. A few years later it would
have been a double hernia. I was growing tall, by Govan standards.
My teens are remembered for the Hibs. The famous five. In those days
some players were not a pretty sight (so what's changed?) but Gordon
Smith was different. He didn't run, he cantered, like a thoroughbred.
The day I went to do my National Service with the RAF was the day
Hungary beat England at Wembley. I saw the game on television in
Bedford, then caught a taxi to RAF Cardington, in time to sign on. The
RAF didn't really want me. Something to do with leading an apprentice
strike.
I wasn't all that keen myself and volunteered to call it quits and go
home with no hard feelings. Then the sergeant exploded: ''If it got out,
lots of these young b*******, due for call up, would be leading strikes
all over the country.''
That's how I ended up in RAF Shawbury, near Shrewsbury, in Shropshire.
Would you believe playing for Shrewsbury at the time was a wee bloke
called O'Donnell, who with Partick Thistle gave Willie Woodburn, the
best centre-half I've ever clapped eyes on, a really hard time.
National Service was not a total dead loss for, while on a course at
St Athan's in South Wales, I saw Cardiff play Preston North End and was
witness to the awesome and enchanting skills of Tom Finney.
Nineteen fifty-nine was the year Real Madrid beat Eintracht at Hampden
Park. On that night it was a joy to be alive.
I was working in London when the great Spurs fluttered from the
chrysalis and saw Jimmy Greaves in his years at Chelsea. Some striker.
Pity he's now an Alf Garnett with hair, or some hair.
Then back in Scotland in time to see the genius of Jim Baxter. Jock
Stein's Lisbon Lions who won the European Cup with a home-grown team and
also broke the defensive stranglehold that was then stifling the game.
My memory lane is illuminated by thoughts of Cruyff, Beckenbauer,
Pele, and Platini -- and a host of others. It's like this: I'm a
football nut and love the game.
And I'm not alone. My niece married a young man who, when Rangers get
beat, goes to his room for a good greet and to compose himself before
joining the family circle. He's dead jammy. If he had been about in the
sixties his tear ducts would have been done in.
Lovers can be understandably blind to the minor blemishes of the
beloved. But when blemishes become serious and debilitating then even
lovers must see that something must be done. That's how I view Scottish
football. Something has to be done to save our beloved game.
Without skill football is a meaningless expenditure of energy. Like
Hamlet without the Prince. Significantly the best talent in our game
today, by a light year or two, is also a Dane. The second best is
English and he isn't in their national squad.
Scottish football is dangerously low on skill and has been for years.
The fear is that we're being left behind and the gap might become
unbridgeable, consigning our nation to the nether regions of world
football.
I reject the idea that there is a simple or single solution. A larger
premier division might help but is no panacea. The Scottish League is
affiliated to the SFA which is the sole governing body of all Scottish
football. Maybe there should be a different organisational relationship
but our problems go well beyond structural realignments.
The current culture of the Scottish game has to be questioned. The
helter-skelter hell-for-leather approach is a nonsense. We can blame
managers but some fans seem to get high on this kind of ersatz
excitement.
Social change was for years ignored as if Scottish football existed in
a vacuum. New technology has opened up a coverage hitherto unknown,
along with massive potential earnings. Football has now a global market.
If our youngsters aren't playing the game in a way that develops their
skills then the output of talent will dry up. Those in their mid-teens
need an arena to hone their skills. Years ago junior football fulfilled
that role but somewhere along the way the juniors became a place for
seniors who hadn't quite made it.
There are lots of other aspects which have to be analysed and
considered. That is the task facing Ernie Walker's committee. It has to
come up with answers that are comprehensive and fundamentally correct or
else we're in deep trouble.
There is no-one better equipped for this job than Ernie who, in my
opinion, was the best football administrator the UK has known in the
post-war years.
Let me tell you something. In the 1980s English football hooliganism
hit the headlines. Mirror Group Newspapers were running a campaign
around the issue. They organised a conference in the House of Commons
with Neil Kinnock and other leaders of the opposition, Ted Croker and
members of the FA. David Pleat represented the managers, and Graham
Taylor the players' union.
At the meeting I was asked why there was no such problem in Scotland.
I then gave each of them a document produced some years before by the
SFA which analysed potential sources of hooliganism in Scottish football
and proposed pre-emptive measures. Some of these were incorporated in
the new Criminal Justice Act Scotland.
People round the table were amazed at the perspicacity of the SFA. The
English FA were belatedly keen to follow Scotland's lead, but in a sense
it was too late.
Thereafter I got to know Ernie Walker. Away from the aloofness of
office he exudes love of the game. To him being secretary of the SFA was
more than a job. He has won for Scotland a respect in the international
councils of the game out of all proportion to our size and clout.
He made sure that Scottish football was getting all the money that was
going from television and other outlets. Friends in television used to
moan to me about Ernie's hard-headedness in negotiations. That was his
job.
The money was needed to sustain the game in general, including the
grass-roots and struggling clubs. Maybe some of it was spent trying to
sustain the unsustainable, but that's another matter.
What I do know is this, the SFA represents a labyrinth of varied and
sometimes conflicting interests. Groupings jealously defend their
powers. In the midst of such an umbrella organisation taking an overview
is difficult. Getting something done about it can be impossible.
This committee of review frees Ernie from such restraints. He is a
highly intelligent man with outstanding administrative abilities. He has
passion for football and a love of his own country. I know because I now
know Ernie Walker very well.
The professionals in UEFA have enormous respect for Walker. They've
told me. If they had their way he wouldn't be taking this job in
Scotland but doing for them one of the most important responsibilities
in the world, for a couple of years or so.
He prefers the less-prestigious and less-rewarding job because he
thinks it has to be done and he can't shirk from it. Now I'm a yes man
for no man and over the years have argued with Ernie about many things
including football. But of one thing I'm absolutely certain, the man is
genuine. He will do this job as a mission of love for the game he loves.
Let him get on with it and help where we can, but with constructive
criticism. It's too serious for point scoring.

<TEXT>
Grozny, Wednesday
HEAVY shelling today forced Russian troops to abandon the captured
Chechen rebel stronghold of Bamut after holding it for just one day.
Colonel-General Mikhail Yegorov, Moscow's acting commander in
Chechnya, told the Interfax news agency that the Russian troops had
forced out rebel fighters yesterday, but later come under fire from
nearby hills.
''Russian troops were later forced to leave the village to avoid
casualties,'' he said.
His commander, Colonel-General Anatoly Kulikov, told a news conference
earlier today that 15 Russian soldiers and about 400 rebels were killed
in the latest series of attacks on Bamut, which began last Friday.
The retreat appeared to deal a blow to Russian efforts to take
complete control of all the fertile and industrially developed areas of
northern and central Chechnya.
Bamut, 30 miles from the devastated capital Grozny, is the key rebel
stronghold in western Chechnya. It is also the gateway to southern
mountainous areas where most of the rebels, fighting for independence
from Moscow, have regrouped.
Yegorov said Russian troops were also involved in heavy fighting in
the village of Serzhen-Yurt, 25 miles southeast of Grozny.
He said they had suffered losses there and conceded that they could
expect strong resistance in the villages of Orekhovo and Valerik near
Bamut.
The Russian failure in Bamut and the growing number of new points of
rebel resistance contrasted with Kulikov's claim today that Moscow had
achieved most of its aims in the Chechen war.
Russia sent in troops on December 11 to end the tiny North Caucasus
region's three-year-old independence drive led by rebel leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev.
''Today Dudayev has no social or economic grounds for continuing the
armed struggle,'' Kulikov said. ''More than 80% of Chechen territory,
where more than 90% of the population lives, has been freed from the
illegal fighters.''
Kulikov said 1518 Russian servicemen had been killed and almost 5000
wounded, and that Moscow estimated 9000 to 9500 Chechen fighters had
been killed.
He did not say how many civilians had been killed, although Russia's
human rights commission has said more than 24,000 died in the battle for
Grozny alone.--Reuter.

THE general secretary of the teachers' union, the EIS, warned that
local government services could go the way of the health service, with
finance managers taking key posts. Mr Ronnie Smith told congress that
decisions would then be financially driven and not taken on what was
needed.
He also spoke of the threats posed by the new councils not having the
statutory requirement to appoint directors of education or even an
education committee. He said that with local government reorganisation,
there were those who would seize the opportunity of doing away with
strong heads of service who were prepared to stand up and fight for
their service.
Congress backed his call for the establishment of directors of
education in the new councils and expressed its concern at the threat to
services posed by local government reorganisation. Mr Matt Smith,
Scottish secretary of Unison, said the new authorities had to be
prepared to unite and make clear to Westminster that they were not
puppets, but elected representatives.

Papeete, Wednesday
ACTOR Marlon Brando missed the funeral of his daughter Cheyenne
because the shock of her death was so great he had to be put under
sedation in his Los Angeles home, a family source said.
Cheyenne was found hanged in her bedroom in Punaauia on the French
South Pacific island of Papeete on Sunday and was buried yesterday next
to Dag Drollet, her murdered boyfriend.
''He (Brando) will come later. He could have evaded the hordes of
photographers in a big city but not in a small place like Tahiti,'' said
the source.
Relatives said the death of Cheyenne had brought about a
Romeo-and-Juliet like reconciliation between her family and that of
Drollet, who was shot dead by Cheyenne's half-brother Christian in the
United States nearly five years ago.
The mothers of Cheyenne and Drollet stood side-by-side at the young
woman's funeral and the names of the young couple now appear
side-by-side on their common pale granite tombstone.
The couple are survived by a five-year-old son, Tuki, born after his
father's death.
Relatives said Cheyenne had been depressed since the killing of
Drollet, for which Christian Brando was sentenced to 10 years'
imprisonment in 1991.
Cheyenne had made three previous attempts to kill herself and had been
treated for depression in France and the United States as well as
Tahiti.
Brando, 71, has zealously guarded his privacy for decades. However
during his son's trial, Brando broke a long public silence, telling
reporters he had become a recluse to preserve his sanity.--Reuter.

TRADE unionists stepped back from backing what could have turned into
a water non-payment campaign when Scotland's supplies are taken over by
Government quangos. A motion to support individuals who refuse to pay
water bills to non-elected boards was sent back for the STUC's general
council to consider.
Mrs Ina Love, vice-president of Unison, opposed the motion, stating
that a policy of non-payment would be ''misguided, irresponsible, and
tactically wrong''. She said it would achieve nothing other than putting
people into debt and starving water authorities of money to pay the
wages of water workers.
Irvine Trades Council, which moved the original motion, said it had
been misunderstood and was not seeking a non-payment campaign, merely
support for indviduals who felt they had to take that path. By remitting
the motion to the general council, delegates did not have to express
their support or otherwise. However, the general feeling was the motion
would have been defeated heavily.

Paedophiles may have been responsible for the murder of nine-year-old
Daniel Handley, whose body was found in woods six months after he
disappeared from near his home in London. It is every parent's nightmare
that their child might be snatched by a stranger - but the real dangers
can be closer to home
AILEEN knows all about paedophile rings. She discovered her husband
was a member of one. That was soon after she found out that her two
young sons had been sexually abused by their father and an unspecified
number of his acquaintances.
Like most concerned parents, Aileen had taught her boys about the
danger of strangers. She never thought, because she did not know, to
warn them against the risk of buggery by their dad and his friends on
weekend access visits.
After Orkney and Cleveland and Rochdale and the recent Ayrshire ritual
abuse fiascos, it seemed a gust of relief swept the land of the
grown-ups. Things on the paedophile front had simmered down. There were
after all no gangs of abusers spicing up their activities with
incantations and spells.
All those tales of ritual abuse were merely the wild imaginings of a
profession on the lookout for sex-crazed black magicians. That adults
might subject children to sexual crimes, to stupefaction by drugs and
bizarre assemblies of abuse was just a myth, a dangerous one, so we
could all relax -- couldn't we? -- and go back to believing our old
perception of the typical paedophile as a violent stranger forcefully
assaulting and raping a child.
Such horrific attacks do occur, but they are rare. Much rarer than the
risk of abuse by a trusted adult.
A survey of more than 500 cases involving 50 convicted offenders,
published last year by the Scottish Office, showed that that nine out of
10 abusers know their victims and most planned the offence.
Those who sexually abuse young children fall into four broad
categories: parents or step-parents of the children, young people aged
between eight and 21, sometimes relatives of the abused child, who carry
out a third of all sexual assaults on children, lone paedophiles, such
as child murderer Robert Black, who are the most difficult to trace; and
active paedophiles in organised rings who share hard-core pornographic
material and contacts.
Research shows that most of the abuse involves manipulative, bribing,
threatening or subtly coercive sexual behaviour. Victims tend to be
carefully targeted and ''groomed'' by the abuser over time, before the
child is subjected to overt sexual behaviour.
The clinical and research evidence indicates that while paedophiles
may present themselves as non-violent and say they want to help the
development of their child ''partners'', their primary concern is their
own perverse sexual gratification.
Dr Arthur O'Connor, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, who has worked
with abusers and the abused in the Irish Republic, stresses that
paedophilia is not a disease, but a classification describing a person's
sexual preference for children.
Those child abusers who come to public attention, because they are
prosecuted or sent to prison or treated by psychiatric services, are not
necessarily representative of the total population of child sex abusers
as a whole. Most, he says, go undetected.
Few paedophiles marry, as they are not attracted to adult women. A
small number do marry and some of those do so in order to have children
whom they can later abuse. Others may target single mothers whom they
befriend or marry in order to have access to the children.
Sometimes, as in Aileen's case, they place personal advertisements
looking for a partner adding phrases such as ''children no problem''.
Aileen was in her thirties, a teacher who had looked after ageing
parents until their death. She made contact with the man she married
through a personal ad. Desperate for children, she admits that she
rushed into marriage with a man she hardly knew. The boys were aged four
and two when they split up.
''At first he only took our older son on access visits, he wasn't much
interested in the wee one. I know why now. When my older boy became
withdrawn and tearful and had bad dreams in the night I thought it was
the separation.
''He would cling to me when his father came for him. Then he had
trouble going to the toilet and I was back and forward to the doctor
with him, but God help me, I never suspected, never. We were a
middle-class couple and I didn't think that kind of thing happened in
our circles.''
The abuse went on, Aileen now believes, for more than two years before
she heeded the warning signals that something was dreadfully wrong.
''He started taking the wee one with him. When they came back on a
Sunday night, the boys would clam up on me, just wouldn't talk about
what they'd done or where they'd been.
''The wee one, in the bath one night began to play with his penis, as
wee boys do, but his brother screamed, and screamed, and it started to
come out, slowly at first, but then just a flood.
''I remember feeling cold and cuddling them and putting them to bed
then just sitting down in the hall, shivering, and I didn't know what to
do.''
It later emerged that her estranged husband was involved with a group
of similarly minded perverts who were using the boys for their own
sexual gratification: ''It wasn't violent, it was wheedling and threats
and rewards.''
Although an investigation was set in train, her husband was not
prosecuted. She was told there was insufficient evidence to proceed.
Aileen remains bitter that he, and the others who abused her sons,
escaped punishment.
''He admitted it to me, in the end, but he just laughed in my face and
said it could never be proved because the physical signs were difficult
to detect and anyway he was a professional man with a reputation . . .''
According to Dr O'Connor, a paedophile can abuse many hundreds of
children in his lifetime. Most are never detected because they
successfully cover their tracks. They threaten, frighten, and manipulate
the child into staying silent. They bribe children with sweets, money,
treats and anything else they can think of.
They make the innocent child believe that it is they who are guilty,
that they will not be believed, will be punished or will be killed if
they tell.
Paedophiles, he says, are plausible and manipulative men who are
frequently described as ''caring'' and ''nice'' and interested in
children. They can work their way into the confidence of parents and
people in charge of organisations and institutions involved with
children.
By doing so many get into positions of control and responsibility and
have access to potential victims. The abuser is so respected and trusted
that sometimes people do not believe when a complaint is made.
''Most do not see themselves as abusing innocent children who are
often powerless to say no and are too young to know what is happening to
them or to give valid consent to sexual activity. In group or individual
therapy with these people one tries to alter these distorted and
abnormal ways of perceiving the reality of their actions and abuse.''
The most recent serious case saw the conviction in June last year of
five men at Swansea. The men, aged between 24 and 41, had taken children
aged between three and 14 for orgies in the countryside of
Pembrokeshire. Eighteen children were taken into care after the
investigation. The ringleader was jailed for 15 years.
It will never be known for sure how many boys died at the hands of
Leslie Bailey and his gang of paedophiles whose sex orgies led to one of
the biggest police investigations into such violence, codenamed
Operation Orchid, in the East End of London. Some officers believe that
up to 20 unknown children and teenagers died.
Bailey was found strangled in his prison cell in 1993 where he was
serving life for the murder of Barry Lewis, aged six, and the
manslaughter of Mark Tildesley, seven, and Jason Swift, 15. Jason had
run away from his sister's home and turned to prostitution. He was paid
#5 by Bailey and three others to submit to sexual acts and died, doped,
of strangulation.
Yesterday detectives who are hunting the killer of young Daniel
Handley confirmed that they are looking at possible links with Operation
Orchid.
Horrific attacks by strangers do occur, but they are rare. Much rarer
than the risk of abuse by a trusted adult

A WOMAN who claimed she quit her job at a greengrocers after being
sexually harassed by her boss was awarded #1777 compensation at an
industrial tribunal yesterday.
Miss Heather Johnstone, 29, of Burnego Road, Dunipace, Stirlingshire,
worked at the Apple Barrel at Lint Riggs in Falkirk.
She told a Glasgow tribunal yesterday that her boss, Mr Bernard Dunn,
who worked at the Computer Shack near to the greengrocers, started
coming over for coffee each morning.
She claimed he made sexual jokes to her and colleague Mrs Elizabeth
Litchfield.
She said she was worried about losing her job with Christmas
approaching, but finally left when Mr Dunn touched her bottom and tried
to touch her breasts.
The shop was closed for the night. She said she told Mr Dunn she
wasn't coming back and he replied, ''Yes, you are finished'' and gave
her #65.
Mrs Litchfield told the tribunal that Mr Dunn had told her he had been
forced to fire Miss Johnstone as she had tried to seduce him in order to
keep her job.
Mr Dunn denied the allegations.
He said Miss Johnstone had told him she was leaving and that he had
paid her the wages she was owed.
Miss Johnstone claimed Mr Dunn used to drive his car up and down the
street where she lived after she quit because of his unwanted advances.
She contacted the police who issued him with a warning.
Mr Dunn admitted he had a warning from the police about driving in a
Dunipace street.
However, he said his reasons for being there had nothing to do with
Miss Johnstone and that he was delivering goods from his computer
business.
The tribunal ruled Miss Johnstone had been sexually harassed and
awarded her a total of #1777 compensation, including #1500 for injury to
her feelings.
The greengrocers shop closed in January.
Last night, Miss Johnstone, said: ''I'm just glad it's all over. It's
been a terrible ordeal.
''But now I've got a new job as an auxiliary nurse, looking after old
folk.''

Canadian-Armenian director Atom Egoyan talks to WILLIAM RUSSELL about
the true nature of his film Exotica which opens at the Glasgow Film
Theatre on Friday week
ATOM EGOYAN remembers Glasgow fondly -- ''It has this tremedous
energy,'' he said. He came to GFT a year or so back where a season of
his films were being shown to considerable acclaim and found the
experience stimulating.
''They were being shown back-to-back, something I would not want to
impose on anyone,'' he added. ''I think one at a time is manageable, but
together -- an embarrassment.'' Which is to say the Canadian-Armenian
director is a modest kind of chap.
His latest film, Exotica, possibly the most accessible work so far
from a very oblique film maker, is a complex, but ultimately fully
resolved mystery story set against the background of a sex club of a
kind found only in Toronto.
Strip dancing involves a girl dancing and stripping on top of his
table for one male customer, but no physical contact is allowed between
them. All the man may do is look.
''People end up spending a lot of money without getting any
satisfaction,'' Egoyan said. ''You cannot go further than having a
dancer torment you, and the boundaries about there being no contact
between customer and dancer are very clearly defined.''
As to why such a bizarre form of asexual sexual entertainment should
have surfaced in Canada, he said that normally when one thought of
Canada and sexuality there was a certain degree of repression involved,
so perhaps that was the reason.
''Many people visit Toronto from the States and strip dancing is
really quite a tourist attraction,'' he added.
He chose the strip dancing club as the background to the story, which
is partly about one man's obsession with one dancer, because he was
trying to deal with a number of characters, who found themselves in a
position where they were very lonely, who felt a sense of community just
eluding them, and the club provided the right setting to bring them
together.
''The plot is based on what they know of each other but cannot
recognise or admit to,'' he said. ''The search for the young girl lost
in the cornfield, which emerges during the story about the man's visits
to the club, and his insistence on having this one woman dance for him,
was something I had written a long time ago. It seemed a really powerful
subject.
''To discover that a relationship between these two people, the man
and the dancer, existed, while dealing at the same time with the darkest
aspect of what a human being is capable of, interested me.
''Any relationship is tremendously optimistic and to combine the two,
the developing love between the man and the woman, and the search in the
field, was something I wanted to explore -- as so often happens, various
things began to come together.
''Only one group, The Ontario Coalition to Save Our Daughters, was
upset by the film. They claimed it could be used as a recruitment by men
trying to lure young women into strip clubs, but they had not seen it.
Had they done so, they would have realised the central event, the
violent death of the young girl, had nothing to do with the club, and
they would have contextualised it.''
He added: ''But even among people who know my other work there was a
feeling, because of its title or its subject matter, that the film was
going to be exploitative. You spend time building a certain kind of
career and people are still suspicious!''

THE publishers of the Times Educational Supplement, TES, won a court
order yesterday banning a new magazine from using the title TES.
The Times Educational Supplement, which has a national weekly
circulation of 130,000, claimed that Arts &amp; Entertainment Publishing
Limited, of Sandyford Place, Glasgow, publishers of the proposed
magazine, intended to deceive the public, particularly potential
advertisers.
Mr Neil Davidson, QC for publishers of The Times Educational
Supplement, of Virginia Street, London, told the Court of Session in
Edinburgh yesterday that the magazine he represented was founded in 1910
and was the market leader in Scotland for jobs advertising in education.
Mr Davidson said his clients discovered a few days ago that the new
magazine was to be published later this month. It was to be aimed at the
education sector (including further education) and called Training and
Enterprise Scotland. It would be using the initials TES.
The publishers were soliciting advertising for the new magazine in
respect of jobs in the education sector using the initials TES.
Mr Davidson said Arts &amp; Entertainment Publishing also used TES
prominently in a circular setting out its advertising rates. It could
not be ignorant of The Times Educational Supplement, known as TES, or
TES Scotland.
He asked for interim interdict against the company.
Arts &amp; Entertainment Publishing Limited was not represented at the
court hearing.
Lord Allanbridge granted interim interdict to publishers of the Times
Educational Supplement, banning the other publishers and anyone acting
for them from describing verbally or in writing any of their services or
publications using the initials TES. The court order also bans them from
publishing any advertising material, magazines, or newspapers using TES
and from soliciting advertising from any publication using the name TES.

THE Accounts Commission has decided to take no further action
following an investigation into the recent sale of industrial estates by
Grampian Regional Council.
Following a complaint to the commission in January, the Controller of
Audit requested the Auditor to undertake preliminary inquiries into the
sale of the leases of the industrial sites.
He has now written to Grampian Regional Council indicating that,
having considered the information provided by the Auditor, he has
decided no further action is required.
Aberdeen District Council had called for the investigation and this
was backed by Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
Grampian region's joint Liberal Democrat-SNP administration sold off
12 industrial sites to help make up the financial shortfall caused by
Government cuts and Mr Robertson wrote to Professor Ian Percy, chairman
of the Accounts Commission for Scotland, expressing concern over the
procedure used for the sale and the price obtained.
He said a calculation by opposition members of the regional council
had shown that the revenue possibilities from the industrial estates in
relation to the price obtained for them suggested that value for money
had not been obtained.
He said opposition councillors had also pointed to the way in which
the transaction took place and the fact that a London-based property
company was the ultimate beneficiary had cast doubts on the way upon
which the process was embarked.
In a reply to Mr Robertson, Professor Percy said the regional council
had decided not to offer the units separately to existing leaseholders
because they considered it unlikely that all 104 tenants would wish to
purchase and they took the view that the best price would be obtained by
offering the estates as an entity.
''They adopted a strategy of selective tendering rather than open
tendering in view of the scale of the sale and the need to identify an
organisation whose interest was genuine, whose commercial and financial
status was of high integrity, and who had the ability to readily fund a
deal of this magnitude,'' he wrote.
He said the Controller had concluded that the #23.6m raised could not
be held to be unreasonable.
Mr Robertson said last night: ''Grampian Regional Council has complied
with the technical aspects of the law but the Accounts Commission cannot
make a judgement on the wisdom of privatising these estates or on the
future of the SNP-Liberal administration to consult the tenants.
''It is sad that the Accounts Commission did not have the power to
make a judgment on the wisdom of such a privatisation or the lack of
consultation with the tenants.
''The SNP leadership still have to justify the full privatisation by
an SNP-controlled council of key public assets and ignoring the views of
their tenants and the Grampian public,'' he said.

KELVINGROVE in Glasgow reverberated yesterday with the sound of half
real, half mock ferocity. Contestants from England, Finland, Germany,
and Spain were limbering up for the XIIIth European Kendo championship
weekend at the Kelvin Hall Arena. Samurais started the matches in the
fifteenth century in Kenjutsu schools using steel swords. The spread of
Zen Buddhism in the warrior classes led to an emphasis on morality in
training and discipline, and the steel became bamboo shinai. Much of the
noise stems from players calling out a strike on a specified part of the
body. Right, for those who can recognise them through their armour, are
Nigel Kettle from London and Marja-liisa Nikunlassi from Helsinki.

<TEXT>
A DEAL for an improved ambulance service in Dumfries and Galloway has
been agreed following complaints about single manning of vehicles and
poor response times.
The regional health board refused to agree terms last year until there
were improvements on both scores.
However, after months of negotiation, the board has signed a #3m
contract with the Scottish Ambulance Service NHS Trust for the provision
of cover for all accident and emergency services.
Helicopter ambulances for urgent transfers to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and
Newcastle are included in the three-year deal.
The region's two NHS trusts have signed separate contracts with the
service for routine patient transport.
Health board general manager, Mr Derek Banks, said yesterday: ''There
has been a high level of co-operation in the negotiations.
''Efforts will continue to improve the service through investment in
new vehicles, equipment, and manning over the next three years.
''I now have every confidence in our ambulance service.''
The service's regional director, Mr Malcolm McVittie, said: ''This is
a marvellous vote of confidence in our organisation and staff. Trust
status means we are entering a new phase in our development and we will
continue to improve and upgrade our service to the public''.
New ambulance stations had been opened recently in Whithorn and
Gatehouse of Fleet, he said.

<HEADLINE>Court told of the new Mr Big of crime Accused in #283,000 robbery trial claims he was bodyguard for 'Glasgow Godfather' Arthur Thompson</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978796822</RECORDNO>

A FORMER bodyguard told a robbery trial yesterday of the underworld in
Glasgow, painting a picture of guns, drugs, and a power struggle to be
the Mr Big of crime.
Mr Thomas Bagan and two others deny robbing a security van in Hamilton
of #283,000.
Mr Bagan, 39, told the High Court in Glasgow that the man who ''set
him up'' for the robbery was a Mr Thomas McGraw who, he alleged, is now
in charge of crime in the city.
He told Mr Michael McSherry, defending, that he used to be a bodyguard
for the late Arthur Thompson. He described him as Glasgow's Godfather.
Asked what he meant, he replied: ''A Godfather is a man with the power
to control crime in Glasgow.''
Mr Bagan said: ''When I was with Arthur Thompson and he was hit, I
would take the flak.''
Mr Bagan, of Station Road, Blantyre, Lanarkshire, said he was also
bodyguard for several years to Thompson's son, Arthur, but he gave up
the job when the son was jailed for drugs offences.
He said he was against drugs and told the court his first wife had
died as a result of her addiction to heroin.
He claimed he was then offered a job by Mr McGraw and became manager
of his public house, the Caravelle, in Balornock, Glasgow.
He said: ''He has taken over from Arthur Thompson and is now the Mr
Big in Glasgow.''
When he joined Mr McGraw, he would negotiate for him during the power
struggle, trying to avoid violence.
''People like me. I would talk rather than have violence,'' he said.
Mr Bagan told Mr McSherry that Mr McGraw wanted him in prison. Asked
why Mr McGraw had set him up for the robbery, Mr Bagan said that about
the end of August he had gone to see a newspaper reporter about a story
he had written.
Mr Bagan said the story was about the Mafia in Glasgow and had claimed
that he was on ''an underworld hit list''.
The article also referred to the murders of Joseph Hanlon and Bobby
Glover, who were found shot in a car.
Mr Bagan said he heard that the reporter was looking for him and he
wanted to ask him about the hit list with his name on it.
Mr McSherry then asked if there had been any attempts on his life. Mr
Bagan replied: ''Several.''
He said: ''Two or three times, I have been driving along in my car and
firearms have been pointed at me and shots fired. Fortunately for me,
they missed.''
On another occasion, he claimed, he was stopped by Arthur Thompson,
senior, with a gun. ''The gun went off and the bullet struck Mr Thompson
on the groin,'' he said.
Mr Bagan said that, on another occasion, he and Mr McGraw were leaving
the Caravelle pub, when he saw Mr Thompson, senior, with a gun. ''He was
going to shoot me and I ended up struggling with him,'' he said.
Mr Bagan is on trial along with Mr Gordon McLeod, 39, of Jacks Road,
Uddingston, and Mr James Scougal, 34, of Angus Walk, Viewpark,
Uddingston.
They deny that on September 19 last, at the rear of the Bank of
Scotland at Brandon Parade South, Hamilton, they forced their way into a
security van, threatened three security men with a loaded sawn-off
shotgun, and robbed them of #283,000.
In his evidence, Mr Bagan said he had incriminated Mr McGraw and two
other men for the robbery.
Asked by Mr McSherry if he had ever gone to the police about the
attempts on his life, Mr Bagan said: ''No.'' He told Mr McSherry that he
had no faith in the police.
At this point, Mr James Scott, prosecuting, said he was objecting to
the line of evidence being led.
Temporary Judge Alexander Wilkinson, QC, sent the jury home for the
day while he listened to legal arguments.
The trial continues.

A BID to manufacture up to #200m of heroin has been thwarted in a
five-month international operation.
Police said yesterday that 45 drums of a chemical essential to process
the drug were tracked across Britain and on to Pakistan by the South
East Regional Crime Squad.
Detectives closed in on alleged gang members with simultaneous raids
in both countries yesterday.
Two men have been arrested in Wembley, north-west London, and two
others in Islamabad and Lahore, with more Pakistan arrests expected.
The operation began in December when ''a team of professional drug
traffickers with strong links to Pakistan'' fraudulently bought a tonne
of acetic anhydride. The chemical is needed to transform opium into
heroin.
''This quantity has the potential to make three tonnes of heroin, with
a street price of approximately #200m,'' a SERCS spokeswoman said.
''A decision was made to allow the chemical to leave Britain in order
to arrest not only the British operators but also their foreign
counterparts.''
British detectives travelled to Pakistan and worked with its
anti-narcotics squad and a local customs and excise liaison officer to
monitor the gang.
''The chemical drums were seized at Lahore and substantial paperwork
has also been seized both here and in Pakistan, confirming suspicions
that this team has been involved in similar shipments,'' the spokeswoman
said.

BRITAIN planned to stage an Entebbe-style raid on an Argentinian
airfield during the Falklands War to blow up enemy aircraft, destroy
Exocet missiles, and kill as many Argentine pilots as possible,
according to a Glaswegian former member of the SAS.
The assault was to be carried out by the regiment's B Squadron and
involved flying the special forces' team in to the target in two
disguised Hercules transport aircraft bearing Argentinian markings and
camouflage.
Once on the ground, the 70 men were to fan out across the base, find
and destroy the Argentine air force's meagre supply of French-built,
ship-killing Exocet missiles, and the Super Etendard strike aircraft
which could deliver them.
Mr Harry McCallion, originally from Lime Hill Road, Gorbals, was one
of a group tasked with storming the officers' mess ''to kill every pilot
there''.
However, many of his most experienced colleagues believed it to be a
suicide mission which would result in the death or capture of the entire
assault force.
Mr McCallion says: ''For a week, we practised low flying, combat
loading, and airfield assaults until we could do it blindfolded. We
attacked airfields from northern Scotland to the Midlands and beyond.
''My particular job was to assault the Argentine officers' mess and
kill every pilot there. If everything went to plan, we would hit them so
fast they would be unable to react.
''But from the start, there had been old hands who opposed the
operation. Many thought it ill-conceived and that it would lead to the
destruction of the squadron as a fighting force.''
In advance of the operation, a nine-man group flew to Ascension Island
in mid-Atlantic and then parachuted into the sea near the task force far
to the south.
They were then to be flown from the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes in a
Sea King helicopter stripped to the bare essentials to give it the range
for the trip. Their job was to scout the target airfield in mainland
Argentina and report back before the main body launched its attack.
The scout team made it into Argentina, the Sea King flying over the
coast at 50ft to skim under enemy radar. But as the troopers began to
disembark a few kilometers from the enemy airfield, a flare arched into
the sky.
The team commander decided there was too great a risk of the operation
being compromised and ordered the pilot to abort and drop his men over
the Chilean border to the south. The helicopter then flew on to the
Chilean coast and ditched, using the cover story that it had been blown
off course after leaving the task force.
The Sea King provided one of the great mysteries of the war. Its
sudden, unexplained appearance gave rise to speculation that special
forces' teams were ''lying up'' on the perimeters of Argentine air bases
to provide early warning of raids on the Falklands beachhead.
According to Mr McCallion, the main mission was still on the cards as
British naval losses mounted around the Falklands and the danger of
losing a vital aircraft carrier grew. His squadron, still cooling their
heels at 22 SAS's headquarters outside Hereford, was told that a
Cabinet-level decision was imminent.
When the green light eventually came, they had moved to Ascension, but
serious doubts resurfaced among those who would have to risk their
lives. A senior NCO resigned. The squadron commander voiced his own
concern and was sacked.
However, as the squadron absorbed these shocks, checked its weapons,
and prepared to board the flights which would take them into Argentina,
the RAF called off the operation.

IN a quirk of history an Englishman founded the Bank of Scotland and a
Scotsman set up the Bank of England. As a Sassenach, John Holland was
not all that bad. He had hitherto fought with the Dutch navy against
England, and reportedly said ''an earnest and ingeneous (sic) friend of
mine, a Scotch gentleman, importuned me one day to think of a Bank for
Scotland . . . so I did''.
Details of banking's in-fighting are revealed in a lavish 300-year
history of the Bank of Scotland by its archivist, Alan Cameron.
William Paterson, founder of the Bank of England in 1694, was later
one of the promoters of the Darien Company, deadly rivals to John
Holland's fledgling Scottish bank.
Mr Cameron argues that the real powers behind John Holland were
London-based Scots merchants seeking to develop trading links between
England, Scotland, and the Netherlands.
They issued notes in sterling because international trade demanded it
and the Scots currency was widely discredited.
The bank was originally suspected of Jacobite sympathies but, during
the 1745 rebellion, all the accounts were secreted in Edinburgh Castle
under the control of government troops.
Unlike most banks of that era and the 21 others it has incorporated
since then, the Bank of Scotland has survived the peaks and troughs of a
surfeit of conceit and over-confidence offset by conservatism and
sensible risk-taking.
Adam Smith believed that unregulated competition in Scottish banking
would lead to the country's international trading eminence.
By the 1870s, it and the other Edinburgh banks (the Royal and British
Linen) were supreme in Britain. Regulations forbidding cross-border
branch networks were to protect England rather than Scotland.

IN an unprecedented move, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has directed
Highland Regional Council to abandon its lenient planning controls for
housebuilding on the Black Isle.
These had allowed for nearly 800 new houses, which many residents
feared would ruin the area's rural character.
The Herald revealed in December that Mr Lang had made a last- minute
intervention to prevent the council adopting its planning blueprint for
the area over the next 10 years, the Black Isle Plan.
He did not call it in but wanted more time to consider it.
This followed representations from residents and unusually strong
criticism from Mr William Paterson of the Scottish Office Reporters Unit
after a public inquiry he conducted into the Black Isle Plan.
He concluded: ''It is difficult to imagine that in many other parts of
the United Kingdom so few people could have achieved the goal of a house
in the country at the expense of so much harm to the landscape,
experienced by everyone else including tourists.''
Local campaigners claimed the council favoured a permissive policy
towards house-building on the Black Isle to help alleviate demand in
Inverness.
Yesterday, a Scottish Office spokeswoman confirmed Mr Lang had been
persuaded that tighter controls were necessary.
''We have issued a directive requiring Highland Regional Council to
modify the housing proposals in the Black Isle Local Plan . . . So their
more permissive policy of housing controls in the Black Isle will not
now apply,'' she said.
It would appear to be the first occasion in Scotland when a Secretary
of State has involved himself in a council's local plan.
It is understood that the Scottish Office was particularly concerned
to prevent individual houses being built in open countryside in what is
already a popular housebuilding area.
A spokesman for Highland Regional Council said the director of
planning would report on this to the regional planning committee on May
24. ''It is worth remembering, however, that Highland Regional Council
has already processed 60 other local plans without any Scottish Office
intervention.''

THE upgrading of Scotland's only opted out school, Dornoch Academy,
from a two-year to six-year secondary was bitterly opposed by Highland
region's education committee yesterday.
Councillors claimed that the Government was using taxpayers' money to
''prop up political dogma'' at the same time as public spending controls
were forcing Highland to consider closing more than 20 schools.
The Dornoch board of management applied for permission to upgrade last
year but the Secretary of State refused because of its lack of
experience. A fresh application to upgrade next year was approved by Mr
Lang on April 11.
By law, Dornoch must consult Highland Regional Council over the
upgrading. It was made clear yesterday that it could expect little
support from the region.
Council vice-convener Mr Peter Peacock said the council had twice
rejected upgrading Dornoch. He claimed Highland region had received
#192,000 less from the Government for the school than it had spent on it
and that Highland taxpayers were paying #3 per head to subsidise the
school without having a say in its development.
He insisted that the Dornoch board of management still did not have
the necessary experience to run a three-year or a four-year school.
Tory councillor John Scott supported the move to upgrade the school
and allow its roll, now 57, to increase.

THE contract for the jacket section of the biggest North Sea platform
to be ordered this year will go to Spain, according to union officials
at the fabrication yards at Nigg and Ardersier. They say they will be
undercut by Spanish subsidies and lose 1000 jobs.
The unions expect the 19,000-tonne structure for Britannia, Britain's
biggest undeveloped gas field, to be built at the Dragados yard in
North-west Spain.
Mr Jimmy Gray, an AEEU official, said: ''We believe that the Spanish
Government is giving their yard a subsidy, which means we face an unfair
fight. The British Government has got to use exactly the same tactics as
the rest of Europe, and make sure that there is a level playing field
when it comes to major North Sea contracts.''
An official of Brown and Root-McDermott, the US company now running
the two Scottish yards, said: ''As far as we know, we are still in the
running. It is news to us that we have lost out on the Britannia order.
We are shedding labour quite quickly just now because many of our
existing contracts are almost complete.''
The Britannia field is being developed jointly by Chevron and Conoco.
A Conoco spokesman said: ''It is not true that we have awarded a
contract for the jacket section of the Britannia platform. That is
several weeks away. At present, we are evaluating bids from a number of
companies in Britain and in Europe.''
He said he could not comment on speculation that the Spaniards had put
in by far the lowest price.
The Britannia Field, 130 miles north-east of Aberdeen, is expected to
produce about 740 million cubic feet of natural gas a day and production
should begin late in 1998 and continue for 30 years.
In the North-east of England, yards owned by Trafalgar House and SLP
have substantial orders for accommodation and drilling modules from the
Conoco/Chevron partnership.

A BANK robber was jailed for 12 years yesterday after being told by a
judge that society deserved ''a rest from the likes of you''.
Anthony Owens, 29, held up two women tellers at gunpoint at a branch
of the Royal Bank of Scotland in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, and robbed them
of #2770.
Miss Angela Housden, 20, was standing beside him in the dock at the
High Court in Edinburgh until the Crown accepted her not guilty pleas to
resetting cash from the raid and stealing a car.
The court heard that the couple planned to marry ''in the near
future'' despite the sentence.
Temporary judge Robin McEwan told Owens that he had subjected the two
tellers to ''a terrifying experience''. He pointed out that Owens had 18
previous convictions and said: ''It is time that society had a rest from
the likes of you.''
Owens, of no fixed address, admitted assaulting Mrs Moira Smith, 39,
and Ms Lorna Sim, 46, at the bank in High Street, Turriff, by presenting
a pistol at them and robbing them last December 22.
He burst into the bank wearing a ski mask and clutching an ex-Service
revolver.
The gun had been in Miss Housden's family. Four rounds were found in
the weapon, although they were not live.
He passed a carrier bag over to Mrs Smith and demanded that she fill
it with cash.
Owens then fled by taxi to the nearby village of Cuminestown, where
police later traced him with most of the cash.
Defence counsel Johanna Johnston said Owens had been addicted to
heroin for 10 years but kicked the habit last November.
He had met Miss Housden in June and they had travelled from England to
visit her parents in Cuminestown for Christmas.
Owens was ''confused and desperate'' at the time of the bank robbery,
said the defence counsel, adding: ''He was anxious to make a go of life
with Angela Housden. He had no money but he was keen that they should
set up home together.''
He saw the gun at her family home and in ''a moment of madness'' saw
the chance to get some cash.
Ms Johnston added added: ''He and Miss Housden intend to marry in the
near future. He is hopeful that he can come out and get on with life
with her.''
After the case, Miss Housden said she intended to stick by Owens and
confirmed that they planned to marry.
''We will wait and see what happens when Tony gets transferred to an
English prison,'' she said.

A CAMPAIGN to stamp out racial discrimination in Scotland was launched
yesterday as it was revealed the number of racist incidents reported to
Scottish police had risen by 10% in the last year.
Uniting Britain for a Just Society, which is backed by the Commission
for Racial Equality (CRE), was launched in Edinburgh by Mr Herman
Ouseley, chairman of the commission.
He said: ''The ethnic minority population in Scotland may be smaller
than in some other parts of Britain but Scots of ethnic minority origin
continue to suffer discrimination and harassment no less than those
living elsewhere in Britain.''
Figures released by the commission reveal that reports in Scotland of
race incidents, which can range from name-calling to murder, have
doubled in the last six years.
The increase has been viewed with growing concern by the commission,
which says the Scottish figures account for around a tenth of the total
number of racially-motivated incidents throughout Britain, while only
2.1% of the UK ethnic population lives in Scotland.
Mr Moussa Jogee, the CRE's commissioner for Scottish affairs, said he
hoped the message would be heard by Scots who tended to dismiss the
problem.
''We will be tapping into the rich vein of tolerance and fairness that
enriches Scottish society, whilst challenging the assumptions and
complacency often based on these self-same feelings, which find
expression in the 'no problems here' attitude, which we hear so often in
Scotland,'' he said.
The campaign aims to spread the anti-race message through a public
education programme.
A special fund was launched in January and has already brought in
#15,000. It will cover the costs of advertising, conferences, and arts
and media events.

ROLLS-ROYCE design workers began a programme of industrial action at
the firm's East Kilbride plant yesterday.
Around 500 staff took part in a walk-out amid claims of renewed
threats from management over redundancy cash. Strike leaders said that,
despite the possibility of losing up to #9000 in redundancy payments,
there had been 100% support for the action.
The company has come in for particular criticism since it was revealed
that job losses coincided with large increases in bonuses for board
members.
The strike will last until tomorrow night but more action is planned
for Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, and a further mass meeting will
be held to discuss the next move.
Rolls-Royce wants to close the aero-engine design unit at East
Kilbride and transfer production to two plants in England. Workers at
other plants have said they will not handle production transferred as a
result of the strike.

SCOTLAND YARD police commissioner Sir Paul Condon yesterday promised a
review over whether or not London police should be routinely armed.
In Scotland, Strathclyde Police Federation called for a change in the
procedure for dealing with firearms incidents.
The moves followed the killing in London of 28-year-old PC Phillip
Walters, while attending what should have been a run-of-the-mill
call-out.
It is the third time in his two years as commissioner that Sir Paul
has had to face up to the death of a London police officer.
Amid angry calls to arm the police force, Sir Paul insisted he would
not be making any snap decisions.
The commissioner made it clear that there was no psychological barrier
he had to surmount over a decision routinely to arm the force. He daily
sent armed officers into the streets of London.
His hesitation was over whether such a move would offer added
protection to officers and indeed whether it would increase the dangers
they daily faced.
The latest murder, in a residential setting in suburban Ilford, has
left colleagues of the dead and wounded officers stunned.
Mr Walters, who was not armed, was shot in the chest and his
colleague, Constable Derek Shepherd, 35, shot in the hand after they
responded to a call made by neighbours to the local police station over
a disturbance.
As they arrived at the scene at 8.35pm on Tuesday, they spotted three
men leaving a house. A struggle quickly developed and shots rang out.
Many more than two rounds were fired from a handgun recovered by other
officers who arrived at the scene. Two men were arrested and a third
escaped.
He was described as being black, aged between 25 and 30, of medium
build, with full moustache and untidy beard and wearing short to medium
dreadlocks. He spoke with a strong Jamaican accent and was wearing
dungarees and a yellow T-shirt.
In the wake of the killing, leaders of the Police Federation were
demanding that something should be done so that police officers are
protected adequately. Existing arrangements were not sufficient, they
declared.
However, Home Secretary Michael Howard insisted that most police
officers in the country did not want to be armed and most people in the
United Kingdom did not want them to be.
''This is a very tragic event which reminds us yet again of how much
we owe to those police officers who risk their lives on our behalf on
the streets of this country day and night,'' he said.
His view was supported by Labour leader Tony Blair.
''Like most people,'' he said, ''I feel instinctively that we would
like to keep our police force as it is and routine arming would
significantly change the nature of the police.''
However, he did add: ''It is something that always has to be kept
under review.''
At a news conference at Scotland Yard, Sir Paul Condon said: ''On
these occasions, I am humbled by the courage of police officers, by
their bravery, by the fact that they are still out there dealing with
calls . . . literally as we speak.'' The killing of Mr Walters was a
devastating blow. ''I think all of the nation will join us today in
extending sympathy and understanding to the family and friends of the
young officer who died and to his injured colleague, Derek Shepherd,''
he said.
In Scotland, the Police Federation branch's representative, Mr Tom
Rowatt, yesterday urged Strathclyde's chief constable Mr Leslie Sharp to
increase the number of armed response units from the current complement
of two, and called on him to ensure that no unarmed officers were sent
to deal with incidents where it was known firearms were involved.
This, he felt, would reassure officers anxious for their safety and
head off demands for the routine arming of police, which the federation
was heavily against.
Strathclyde Police's current policy in reacting to incidents where
firearms are known to be involved is that all available units are
dispatched to the scene, together with an armed response unit, one of
two which continually patrol the area.
Mr Rowatt also said: ''We need to increase the forces' capability to
deal with these sorts of incidents, which seem to be growing daily. With
only two cars containing firearms available at any time, what happens,
as has already occurred, when three incidents in different parts of the
region occur at the same time?''
Mr Sharp issued a statement saying he was very much aware of the
dangers facing his officers, an awareness reinforced by regular meetings
with police officer groups, including the federation.
He indicated that his policy was reviewed regularly and if necessary
would be updated.

<HEADLINE>New row in store for Tartans Society</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE controversial Scottish Tartans Society was at the centre of a new
row yesterday after it was revealed that it is planning to move its
collection from a specially-prepared home in Stirling to a shop in
Edinburgh.
The collection, which includes original garments worn by Sir Walter
Scott, David Livingstone, and Queen Victoria's manservant John Brown, is
to move from Stirling's Tolbooth to a new gallery in the up-market store
Scotch House, if an extraordinary general meeting of the society on
April 29 gives approval.
Formerly based in Comrie, the collection moved to Stirling last year
after a dispute about rent and car parking at the former premises.
Dr Gordon Teall, executive president of the society, said a deal had
been struck with Scotch House, part of the Burberry group, to share
admission receipts and thereby guarantee the society the income it
needed for the upkeep of the collection.
However, Mr Fergus Wood, one of the three-man consortium who led the
drive to ''rescue'' the collection, said yesterday that he was
''gutted''.
He continued: ''When the society needed the collection moved from
Comrie to a safe home, we brought it to Stirling at our own expense. We
set up an exhibition and maintained the artefacts in the special
conditions they require, and spent a not inconsiderable amount of money
in good faith on the whole exercise. We're naturally very
dissatisfied.''
In a further twist last night, Stirling District Council, which
supported the Tolbooth exhibition with #10,000 last year, said it had
''lost confidence'' in the value of the collection after an independent
appraisal by tartans expert Mr Alastair Campbell, of Airds.
Tourism officer Mr Kenneth Wardrop said: ''The appraisal showed there
was not the basis there of a national museum of tartan.
''There are one or two items that are gems but 90% of it is bog
standard stuff.''
Mr Wardrop said it was still intended to re-open the exhibition in the
Tolbooth this summer, using the display material commissioned last year.

SEVERE financial cuts on rugby union were urged yesterday as a
powerful group of MPs urged the sport to end the pretence of
''shamateurism''.
The National Heritage Committee said in a report that the regulations
governing rugby union should be amended to remove the discrimination
against rugby league.
Until this was done, no further money from the Sports Council or any
other body which distributed public money either at local or national
level should go to the RFU or any of its member clubs.
The committee also recommended that no further distribution of
National Lottery proceeds should be made to rugby union clubs until
rugby league was treated equally with all other sports in union's
regulations.
The committee, which took evidence from senior representatives of both
codes, clearly was concerned about the allegations of ''boot money''
paid to top union players, and the members clearly believe that at the
top level there is little difference between league and union players.
Among those interviewed by the committee was the secretary of the
Rugby Football Union, Mr Dudley Wood, who said the word ''amateurism''
no longer described what was going on in rugby union.
However, he strongly denied that direct payments for playing were made
to players either at the top level or through their clubs, and he
strongly defended the non-professional status of the game.
Questions were asked about the earnings of stars such as England
captain Will Carling, Mr Wood's response was that everything was being
done under the rules laid down by the International Rugby Football
Board, which allows players, in certain circumstances, to earn money
through, for example, opening supermarkets and personal appearances.
The committee believes that the distinction between the two codes has
become blurred, and the members want to do away with the restriction
which states that a league player cannot come back to union until a
three-year gap has elapsed.
The report states: ''Rugby union is now fast retreating from the use
of the word 'amateur,' which is just as well in view of the ample
evidence provided to the committee that many pseudonymously ''amateur''
rugby union players receive not only considerable financial rewards from
promotional and other activities which derive from their participation
in the sport as players, but also receive rewards -- both in cash and in
kind -- which the Inland Revenue taxes as direct payment for their
services as players.
Mr Wood said last night: ''We met the committee and it was obvious
their minds were already made up. I don't believe the committee has much
credibility. We only receive #70,000 a year in Government money and,
even if this report is accepted, it will not shake us up at all. We are
a self-financing union.''
In a statement after the report was published, the IRFB said: ''A full
review of the amateur regulations as well as the relations between rugby
union and rugby league will be undertaken at a special meeting of the
IRFB Council to be held in Paris in August.''

EXCLUSIVE
AN architect who was exposed as an undischarged bankrupt with no
professional indemnity insurance has been expelled by the Royal
Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.
Mr James R Marshall, of Edinburgh, who has been practising for more
than 40 years, was made bankrupt more than 20 years ago, and thought in
Scotland ''you stopped being a bankrupt after a while''.
Last night he talked for the first time of the action taken against
him.
The move by the RIAS followed a 19-month investigation.
Mr Marshall, a sole practitioner, was expelled from the Fellows class
of membership which is open only to architects over 35 who have held
senior architectural positions.
The findings of the RIAS stated that he conducted himself in a manner
which was derogatory to the professional character of an architect in
relation to the construction of a house.
It also determined that Mr Marshall had been practising as an
architect although he was an undischarged bankrupt and did not maintain
professional indemnity insurance.
Mr Marshall talked to The Herald at the door of his office address in
Gloucester Lane in the New Town area of Edinburgh. He said he accepted
the RIAS findings.
Mr Marshall said the house problem had happened around eight years
ago.
He said: ''The difficulties with the house was caused by a stupid
mistake. A builder had built the house in West Lothian and I issued a
certificate saying it was okay.
''It was then sold on and unfortunately when people bought it they
found there were problems with it. I freely admit I didn't pick up the
problems or notice the faults.
''As for practising as an undischarged bankrupt I was made bankrupt as
long ago as the late 1970s when the firm I was in with my partner ran
into difficulties.
''I thought in Scotland you stopped being a bankrupt after a while so
I didn't know I was still bankrupt.''
He said he could still call himself a design consultant but described
himself as ''totally skint''.
When asked if he thought being expelled might affect his design
consultancy business he said: ''Nobody knows about this yet. We'll have
to gauge reaction to what you write.''
On the timescale of its investigation, an RIAS spokeswoman said: ''We
were given the original complaint on July 30, 1993.
''We responded very quickly and wrote to Mr Marshall in August and
twice in November but got no response from him.
''We continued our investigations and found details of the
bankruptcy.''
The RIAS confirmed details of the allegations against Mr Marshall but
said it could not comment further. It said client confidentiality made
it impossible to release the name of the people who had made the
original complaint.
An RIAS source said a move to expel a member was not taken lightly and
it was ''highly unusual'' for it to take such an action against a senior
architect who had been practising for so many years.

A GLASGOW-BASED charity offering therapy and counselling to sufferers
of multiple sclerosis faces a cash crisis because the public prefers
buying National Lottery tickets to making charity donations, it was
claimed yesterday.
Mrs Margaret Neill, financial administrator for the Multiple Sclerosis
Therapy Centre in Maryhill, said that in the last five weeks the charity
had received only #300 in donations when normally it would receive
''thousands''.
''Cans are coming back empty from the pubs and our own members are
putting any odd money into Lottery tickets and scratch cards,'' she
said.
The centre has always relied largely on public donations and charity
events, such as sponsored walks, to fund its #96,000 a year outgoings,
and while there has never been much money to spare, it has managed to
survive.
''It is just in the last five weeks that we have hit this problem. It
seems to be a new thing -- that with the Lottery, takings have gone
down, donations have gone down. Collecting cans coming back from garages
are empty. People going into garages are buying scratch cards or Lottery
tickets instead of putting money into our cans,'' she claimed.
Mrs Neill said she needed to find #8694 in the next month or she would
not be able to pay staff wages, PAYE, or buy the oxygen cylinders used
for therapy.
The centre, which has been going for 12 years, offers physiotherapy
and hyperbaric (high pressure) oxygen treatment to MS sufferers, and
counselling and nursing advice to sufferers and their carers. Its
membership list includes 850 sufferers in the West of Scotland, 380
within the Greater Glasgow Health Board area.
Mrs Neill added that the centre had also taken in a patient from the
burns unit of one Glasgow hospital as its oxygen therapy was believe to
speed up healing.
The centre's financial problems were exacerbated last year when a
charity shop in Duke Street proved unsuccessful. However, those debts
had been paid, she said.
Mrs Neill also said that Strathclyde Regional Council had put up the
rent from #6500 to #8000, effective from June.
She added: ''I shall be asking the health boards to help -- it is
their patients we are looking after because they don't have the
facilities.''
Mrs Maria Fyfe, Labour MP for Maryhill, said that if the centre wanted
to raise its financial problems with her, she would certainly look in to
other funding prospects.
Councillor Robert Gray, who represents Maryhill on Glasgow District
Council, said that he was trying to convince Strathclyde region to help,
for instance by waiving rental payments for regional premises used by
the charity.

<HEADLINE>British Gas told it must provide a better service</HEADLINE>

BRITISH Gas was warned yesterday that it could become the first
company to be stripped of a Government Charter Mark unless it improves
services to customers.
Public Services Minister David Hunt said the stamp of approval would
be removed unless standards were raised.
He spoke after the main gas consumer group said complaints about
British Gas had risen dramatically during the past year.
It was the latest blow for a firm which in recent months has come
under attack for giving a 75% rise to chief executive Cedric Brown,
cutting jobs, reducing showroom services, spending less on safety checks
and offering discounts to direct debit customers -- who tend to be the
better off.
However, last night British Gas executives said they were confident of
retaining the mark and blamed their troubles on a huge increase in
telephone calls from customers.
Earlier this year, the Gas Consumers' Council urged the Government to
revoke British Gas's Charter Mark in the wake of increasing customer
concern.
Figures showed that in the three months to the end of January, the
council's 12 regional offices dealt with almost 20,000 complaints -- 94%
rise on the same period the previous year.
In January alone, there were 5246 complaints -- a 172% rise and the
highest monthly figure since the company was privatised in 1986.
The council said that figures to be published next week will show a
''significant increase'' in complaints during the first quarter of 1995.
Major areas of concern for customers have been accounts, servicing,
staff manner and failure to reply to letters or answer phone calls.
The council said the fall in British Gas's previously high reputation
for customer service has come as the company prepares for the ending of
its monopoly of supply to Britain's 18 million domestic gas users.
Competition will be phased in over the next few years. Private firms
will be allowed to offer services to domestic customers for the first
time -- and they are promising to reduce bills.
To prepare for the challenge, British Gas has split itself into
different divisions and tried to cut costs.
Council director Ian Powe said yesterday's move by the Government
showed the company had not acted wisely.
''Intervention by the Prime Minister's Citizen's Charter Office, his
custodian of public service standards, shows how unwise British Gas was
to cut corners in customer care while so hurriedly preparing for the
competitive market,'' he said.
Mr Hunt said a ''programme of improvement'' had been drawn up with
British Gas and the GCC. He said British Gas was determined to
''re-establish their reputation for excellence''.
The situation would be reviewed at the end of the year, he said,
adding that complaints about Mr Brown's pay rise were not a factor in
the Government's decision to intervene.
British Gas said it was pleased to have retained its Charter Mark.
Mr Mike Alexander, managing director of public gas supply, said:
''There is no reason why British Gas should lose its Charter Mark. Our
overall service standards have not fallen.
''However, the huge change British Gas is going through to prepare for
competition in the domestic gas market and the heightened publicity
about the company undoubtedly concerned some people.
''This was reflected in increased telephone contact from our
customers. Calls doubled to over 500,000-a-week causing us some
temporary difficulties and we regret any inconvenience to customers.
''We've now resolved this situation by bringing in more staff and
telephone lines and staying open longer. We have also put in place a set
of additional actions which will ensure that our service standards will
not drop.''
Labour Consumer Affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths accused British Gas
of being ''completely incredible and unbelievably smug''.
He added: ''How British Gas can say that their overall service
standards have not fallen and that their standards are excellent in the
face of the swingeing cuts they have made is astonishing.''
Mr Griffiths called on British Gas to review its services cuts. He
said he was seeking an urgent meeting with Ministers and Mr Brown to
ensure the service gets back to acceptable levels.
He said the warning was ''British Gas's last chance to redeem
themselves in the eyes of customers''.SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond said
''It is my firm view that British Gas should have had its Charter Mark
taken away given the unacceptable way in which they have behaved.
''The lesser penalty of what amounts to them being put on probation
will strengthen the hand of those shareholders who are determined to
challenge the selfish behaviour of the British Gas top brass at their
annual general meeting.
''British Gas have been shown to be completely out of touch with their
staff, their shareholders and their customers.''

HOME OFFICE Minister Michael Forsyth does not yet know who will try to
take his marginal Stirling seat from him, but in Labour's case he
learned yesterday the candidate's gender.
The constituency Labour Party decided to become the second in Scotland
to agree in principle to have an all-women short list. It met on Tuesday
and voted 28-3 in favour of the move.
In an open selection procedure for the 1992 General Election, Ms Kate
Phillips was adopted and she ran Mr Forsyth to within 703 votes.
Many members of the Labour Party have been campaigning to ensure that
the overwhelming male bias among MPs is corrected and, to this end, they
have been promised that at least three of six targeted seats -- held
either by a retiring Labour member or regarded as highly winnable --
will be guaranteed to them by drawing up all-women short lists.
Ayr constituency party recently agreed that it would select a woman to
take on Tory MP Phil Gallie.
The four other targets are the Tory-held Aberdeen South marginal and a
new seat to be created in the city; the Inverness, Nairn, and Lochaber
seat, a Liberal Democrat marginal where Sir Russell Johnston is stepping
down; and Motherwell South, where Labour's Dr Jeremy Bray is retiring.
Labour's Scottish general secretary, Mr Jack McConnell, said
yesterday: ''I am absolutely confident that at least one of the Aberdeen
constituencies will follow suit and we may even get more.
''A lot of political commentators were predicting we wouldn't deliver
on having more women candidates at the next election, just as they
predicted we wouldn't get the reform of Clause 4 through the Scottish
conference. I am delighted once more to prove the pundits wrong.
''The important thing is that the constituency have done this
enthusiastically and by a huge majority, and are extremely positive
about it. They have not had to be cajoled.''
The decision will inevitably be a blow to a number of leading male
party activists who would have liked the chance to take on Mr Forsyth.
Mr Forsyth made light of the news. He said: ''This sounds a bit odd .
. . I thought that the Labour policy of excluding men was meant to apply
to winnable seats.
''I am sure that, when the time comes, the people of Stirling will
choose their MP on the basis of merit, experience, and commitment.''
Mr Ramsey Millar, constituency party secretary, said: ''The local
party are wholeheartedly behind this decision and the party's efforts to
increase the number of Labour women MPs.
''We have a large number of excellent women to choose from and we look
forward to selecting the candidate who will defeat Michael Forsyth at
the General Election.''

<HEADLINE>Blair rejects 'closet Tories' charge over crusade to modernise Labour</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night emphatically rejected the charge
that Labour were becoming ''closet Tories'' as he mounted a final bid to
win support for his drive to modernise the party.
He insisted that the move to scrap Clause 4 of the Labour constitution
-- tying the party to nationalisation -- was the key to winning public
trust.
The Labour leader told the final meeting of his nationwide tour, at
Lewisham in south London, that traditional Labour supporters were lining
up alongside new members to support the new-look party.
Over the past three months, he has taken his crusade for change to
20,000 party members in 24 towns and cities across the country in an
effort to win over the rank-and-file doubters who hold the key to
continued reform.
With two major unions, the TGWU and Unison, now pledged to oppose
scrapping Clause 4 at the special party conference on April 29, Labour
leaders know the stakes are higher than ever.
Mr Blair said the public was listening to Labour because it recognised
it as the party of the mainstream majority and wanted a fresh start in
politics.
''Don't let people say this may put off traditional Labour supporters
-- they want a Labour Government and one that will address their
aspirations,'' he said.
Mr Blair said modernisation was the key to progress for Labour and
critical to building up trust with the electorate.
He told Clause 4 opponents: ''It is not just electorally popular, it
is right -- and it shall carry on.''
0 Earlier, Mr Blair launched the Labour local government election
campaign south of the Border with a call to voters to deliver a
''massive blow'' to help drive the Government out of office.
The Tories reacted furiously last night to a Labour's local elections
broadcast which branded John Major a liar and accused him of breaking
his pledges on taxation.
Cabinet troubleshooter David Hunt angrily accused Mr Blair of stooping
to ''gutter politics'' after the Labour leader chaired a news conference
at which the broadcast was previewed.
The broadcast details tax pledges made by Major during the 1992
General Election campaign which, it says, he failed to keep. It adds:
''You lied Mr Major, to every one of us.''
Mr Hunt, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, dismissed the
broadcast as no more than a ''stream of personal abuse'' which would end
up backfiring on Labour.
''A broadcast which calls the elected leader of this country a liar 15
times in four minutes brings immense discredit on its authors. It
belittles the democratic process and is an outright abuse of the free
airtime provided to the political parties for serious issues of
debate,'' he said.
''The public know that the Prime Minister is a man of integrity.
Labour's broadcast will backfire on them and discredit their campaign.
''It is much to be regretted that Mr Blair has chosen to associate
himself so personally with this sort of gutter politics.''
The row marks the lates twist in a bitter campaign which opened with a
claim by Tory chairman Jeremy Hanley that Labour councils tend to be
corrupt -- a remark his deputy John Maples later had to apologise for.

THE Government has decided to accept a Lords defeat on war widows'
pensions when the Pensions Bill returns to the Commons next week.
Peers decided that the widows, who lose their #140-a-week pension on
remarriage, should have it restored if they are subsequently widowed for
a second time or divorced.
Ministers have accepted that the amendment must stay after Whips told
them that several Tory MPs had refused to support the Government in
overturning the amendment.
A Commons early-day motion calling on the Government to ''honour the
dead of two World Wars and the campaigns since 1945'' by accepting the
proposed change attracted the signatures of more than 190 MPs.

THE heart of Middle America was shattered by an act of terrorism
yesterday.
A massive car bomb blast stripped a federal office building of its
glass, marble, and concrete skin, sending smoke and flames shooting into
the air and panicked people running for cover.
In a matter of seconds, the normally bustling streets around the
federal office building in the heart of Oklahoma City resembled Sarajevo
or Beirut at the height of its civil war.
The blast, felt 30 miles away and which sent shards of glass flying
over six blocks had the effect of a giant can opener, peeling away one
side of the glass and concrete building.
The marble and concrete facade of the building was hurled on the
streets, crushing cars and other vehicles.
Then, about 90 minutes after the explosion, there were reports of a
second bomb being found, causing panic in the streets.
Although the second bomb rumour proved false, the immediate panic will
not be easily calmed.
The destruction of the Federal building in Oklahoma City sends the
same chilling message that the bombers of New York City's World Trade
Centre did in 1993: no one is safe anywhere.
''A terrorist gains by creating a climate of fear. They want us to
think that they can get us anytime, anywhere,'' said Mr Steven Emerson,
a leading expert on Islamic extremists. And they can, he said.
He went on: ''The modus operandi and circumstantial evidence leads in
the direction of Islamic terrorism.''
He said Oklahoma City has been for the past decade a centre for
radical Islamic activity in the United States, a place where radicals
established homes and networks. It has also been the site of various
Islamic conventions including one in 1992 where 6000 people cheered
calls for killing Jews and infidels, Mr Emerson said.
Another expert in terrorism said the bomb outrage would send waves of
fear and shock around Middle America,
''If it had happened in New York or Los Angeles it would have been
less incomprehensible but Oklahoma City represents Middle America and
that will add to people's fear,'' said Dr Conor Gearty, reader in law at
King's College London and author of the book Terror.
''So much of Americans' fear is based on insubstantiated enemies and
if the terrorists are not caught quickly anxiety will become enormous.''
Dr Gearty said Americans tended to become more fearful about acts of
terrorism than many other nations.
He recalled that even when President Reagan ordered the bombing of
Libya, Americans went to extraordinary lengths to avoid the risk of
becoming a terrorist target.
''This sort of thing takes you deeply into the psyche of a nation.
Americans are quite nervous about violent crime and are deeply anxious
about life in general,'' said Dr Gearty.
He stressed: ''A lot depends on what happens in the next few days and
whether there are any quick arrests.
''If the arrests are followed by convictions then the public will see
that the authorities are up to the task and the incident could be put
down as an isolated episode.''
Mr Ira Lipman, president of Guardsmark Inc., one of the country's
largest security firms, said: ''Whoever did it, picked an easy target,
certainly easier than the World Trade Centre is today. Terrorists always
pick targets where they are going to succeed.''
The blast occurred two years to the day after the government attack on
the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, that killed 86 people,
including about 30 children.
The federal agency responsible for that disaster was the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF). The bureau has an office in the
Alfred Murray federal building. Other government offices there were the
Social Security Administration, the Secret Service (which deals with
currency counterfeiting as well as protecting public figures), and the
Drug Enforcement Agency.
A number of Branch Davidians who survived the Waco conflagration were
tried and convicted but others are still free.
However, one survivor of Waco denied involvement by the group in
yesterday's attack.
''In no way are the Branch Davidians connected with the bombing,''
said Clive Doyle. ''The date is the only connection.''
Branch Davidian supporter Ron Engleman, who broke the news of the
Oklahoma City blast to survivors and other supporters at a commemoration
ceremony of the Waco raid, also denied that the group had anything to do
with the blast.
The investigations starting last appeared more concentrated on Islamic
terrorists like the ones who carried out the Trade Centre bombing.
Another group of Muslims is currently on trial in New York for plotting
to carry out a further series of bombings in the city.
''As in the World Trade Centre case, an informant and a slip-up are
needed to solve this,'' Mr Emerson said.
The big break in that case came when officials discovered the man who
had rented the truck that carried the 1200-pound bomb to the garage of
New York's tallest building.
They did that because the man signed his own name to the rental form
and gave his right address. Then the FBI came up with an informant.
Now many experts are wondering if the Oklahoma blast was connected to
the capture two months ago of the alleged mastermind of the Trade Centre
bombing, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, in Pakistan after a $2m reward had been
promised.
His capture led to vows of revenge. Was Oklahoma the place for that
retribution?

A YOUNG entrepreneur has scored a memorable victory by pitting his
wits against the military genius of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Mr Andrew McLennan has devised a computer game for his award-winning
company which gives players the opportunity to re-stage the Battle of
Austerlitz.
The business, TBA Games Ltd of Kilmarnock, was one of the fledgling
companies recognised yesterday in the Livewire Business Start-Up Awards
Competition.
The company designs and markets interactive computer games played by
subscription through the mail.
Mr McLennan, 24, won more than #1000 and a place in the national
finals, to be held in June.
The game, called Austerlitz, allows players, equipped with only a pen
and paper, to take on the French Emperor and his army.
The computer works out the implications of their tactics and responds
with the battlefield consequences.
Another computer company, The Solution Works, scooped the top prize at
the awards in Aberdeen yesterday.
The business, run by three young men from Greenock, develops bespoke
software for business information systems.
A new force in the UK database market, it offers a complete package of
specialist IT services, including training.
Mr Andrew McKelvie, 25, Mr Russell Sneddon, 23, and Mr John Shiveral,
23, share #5000 and a place in the final.
A total of 14 aspiring boardroom gurus had been considered for the
Livewire awards, which are supported by Shell UK.
Other prizes went to Ms Jacqueline Stephen, of the Sandwich Grove,
Aberdeen; Ms Michelle Hutcheson, of Universal Dance Productions,
Livingston, and Ms Amanda Trotter, of Kids' World Nursery, Dumfries.
* Miner's daughter Sandra Easton yesterday won a top business award.
She was named British Coal Enterprise Ltd's Female Enterpreneur of the
Year.
Ms Easton, 44, who left school with no qualifications, started her own
company, Lomond Plant Ltd, with the help of loans from BCE and Shell in
1988.
She began with just four second-hand JCBs, two Caterpillar vehicles,
and six operators.
Now her firm -- with bases in Falkirk and Edinburgh -- has 43 machines
and 46 employees.
Turnover last year was #1.25m and this year's figure is expected to be
even higher.
Ms Easton's major clients include Wimpey, Tarmac, Scottish Power, and
British Gas.
Her award -- a new accolade for businesswomen who have received
funding from BCE -- is in recognition of her contribution to job
creation in a former coalfield area.
Yesterday, she received her award from Mr Lex Gold, director of CBI
Scotland, who said: ''I trust that it will encourage more women to
follow her example.
Ms Easton, who worked for 12 years in someone else's plant- hire
business, said:''I attribute a lot of my success to the plant operators,
who are brilliant.
''The rest is due to the support of my family and determination to
prove to my former employer that I could do it -- he gave me six months
when I left to go it alone!''

THE traditional Scottish pub is being squeezed out of business in a
price war between off-licence chains, the vice-president of the Scottish
Licensed Trade Association warned yesterday.
Mr Paul Waterson, reacting to news that the price of a pint is to rise
by up to 5p, said publicans were being forced to foot the bill for the
off-sales battle.
Scottish Brewers announced a range of increases yesterday which could
push up the cost of Tartan Special and McEwans Lager by between 4p and
5p.
Tennents Caledonian also confirmed they were currently undertaking a
review of prices.
Mr Waterson said: ''There is a massive increase in uncontrolled
drinking through the off-licence trade taking place right now and we are
paying for it. Every time someone drinks a pint of beer in the pub, they
are subsidising the can of beer someone is drinking in the street.
''You see the price of cans and bottles at rock-bottom prices in
off-licences. The brewers are having to subsidise this price war by
increasing the prices of beer through pubs.
''They will claim that the beer is sold to pubs and off-licences by
different companies -- but it is all produced by the same parent
organisation.''
Mr Waterson, also president of Strathclyde SLTA, said: ''Barrellage
figures are down all over the country and another price increase at this
time will force more people out of pubs.
''Our latest figures show that by the year 2000 a third of all beer
drunk in Scotland will come from off-sales -- that will represent a 44%
increase.''
Mrs Carol Douglas, public relations manager for Scottish Brewers, said
there was no relation between the cost of a pint in a pub and the cost
of a can in an off-licence.
She said Scottish Brewers, a subsidiary of Scottish and Newcastle
Breweries, supplied only pubs, clubs, and bars, adding: ''We don't sell
to off-licences.''
Mrs Douglas described yesterday's rises as the lowest in six years and
well below the rate of inflation.
Scottish Brewers have increased the prices to the trade of Tartan
Special and McEwans Lager by 2p a pint. Higher gravity brands, including
McEwans 80/- and McEwans Export, will increase by up to 3p a pint.
''Taking into account pub retailing cost, the company anticipates an
average across-the-counter rise of 4p to 5p,'' said Mrs Douglas.
Meanwhile, the 200-member Parliamentary Beer Club announced yesterday
that it was to investigate concerns over the commercial impact of beer
tax differences within the European Single Market.

THE ''rookie'' police officer Phillip Walters, above, who was shot
dead on what was thought to be a routine call-out in East London, had
already faced up to armed robbers.
Mr Walters, along with colleagues, last year arrested a man robbing a
chemist's shop in Ilford.
Before he turned up at that incident, he knew the suspect was armed
and that a firearm had been used.
However, on Tuesday night, when he responded to a call in Empress
Avenue, Ilford, he had not the slightest inkling that suspects would be
carrying a handgun.
Mr Walters had been involved in various careers before joining the
force two years ago and in each he had attained management
responsibility.
He was awarded the Baton of Honour at his police college for being the
most outstanding student in his intake.
His last job before becoming a police officer was a flight controller
for British Midland Airways.
''He was one of life's achievers,'' his boss at Ilford nick,
Superintendent Barry Vincent declared.

masked, threatened two women members of staff at the office in Queens
Buildings, Kirkintilloch Road, before escaping with a five-figure sum of
money.
No shots were fired and no-one was injured. The raiders left in a grey
coloured J-registered Honda Concerto which was driven by a fourth man
who did not enter the post office. The car, stolen from the Maryhill
area, was recovered a short time later in Douglas Court, Lenzie. Anyone
with information is asked to contact 0141 776 1113.

AN improvement programme costing #750,000 at Musselburgh Racecourse
has attracted a grant of #262,000 from the European regional development
fund. Councillor Pat O'Brien, leader of East Lothian District Council,
said yesterday he was delighted with the level of support from the
European Union.
The programme will provide a new #500,000 hospitality block, which is
to be opened by the Queen in July. There will also be improvements to
the grandstand and upgrading of the stableyard.

<HEADLINE>School expels two 13-year-olds for allegedly dealing in drugs</HEADLINE>

TWO 13-year-old boys have been expelled from one of Scotland's top
secondary schools for allegedly dealing in drugs.
A girl, also aged 13, was given a 10-day suspension after teachers
claimed she had bought drugs from the boys.
Police were called to Aberdeen Grammar School on March 29, days before
the Easter holidays, when the allegations came to light.
The two boys, who are both in second year, are understood to have been
selling cannabis near the school gates.
Headteacher, Mr Bill Johnston, said yesterday: ''It was an exchange of
money for illegal substances, which may have been taken elsewhere.''
He emphasised there was no evidence of the pupils having taken the
drugs within the school grounds.
He added: ''We regard what has happened as a very sensitive and
serious matter.''
Mr Johnston said the parents of the three pupils involved had all been
informed. He had met some of them to discuss the matter.
He said a final decision on what to do about the three pupils would be
made after further investigations.
''There is a regional policy about drugs and drug abuse because it is
recognised that it is widespread as a social problem.
''When it happens, obviously we are very concerned, but we have to act
responsibly.''
Mr Johnston revealed that, a week before the incident, the school
board had given a presentation to Grammar School parents on the dangers
of drugs.
A spokesman for Grampian Police said they had attended the school at
around 10.30am and that one of the boys had been taken to police
headquarters for questioning.
It is not yet known if a report will be submitted to the reporter to
Aberdeen children's panel.
Grampian region's education convener, councillor Joan Orskov, said the
case should alert other parents to the widespread drug problem.
''I do not believe there is a single secondary school in Scotland that
is not at risk in this way and, sad as I am to say it, many primary
schools as well,'' she said.
''It is always disappointing when something like this happens but we
are no more protected and no better than anyone else.''
Aberdeen Grammar School is widely regarded as one of the best
secondary schools in Scotland.
It was formerly an all-boys school and only the most academically
gifted were allowed to study there.
A statue of the school's most noted ex-pupil, nineteenth century poet
Lord Byron, stands in the school quadrangle.
The school has more than 1000 pupils.

A legal battle to overturn a
council decision to license a city- centre sauna opened yesterday at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Unemployed bookkeeper Mrs Debra Scanlon, of Iona Street, Leith, is
challenging a decision by Edinburgh District Council earlier this year
to grant a licence to the Gemini Sauna, which is near her home.
In what is thought to be the first action of its kind, she claims that
the council reached an unreasonable decision and acted beyond its
powers.
Mrs Scanlon also claims the amenity of the area would be affected if
the sauna -- owned by Mr Ian Haig -- were to be used for prostitution.
Preliminary legal matters were debated by lawyers acting for Mrs
Scanlon, Edinburgh District Council, and Mr Haig as the hearing got
under way yesterday afternoon.
Advocate Gordon Steele, representing the local authority, said Mrs
Scanlon had already been allowed to argue her case sufficiently before
the decision was taken by the council.
He also claimed that new matters had been introduced in the case
yesterday by Mrs Scanlon and these had not been examined or discussed
earlier.
The hearing, before Sheriff Nigel Thomson, continues.

THE Tory chairman and the Shadow Scottish Secretary were at
loggerheads yesterday over the row about alleged drugs dealing and
money-laundering in Paisley.
Tory chairman Jeremy Hanley said he understood that there would be a
Labour Party investigation, ''following the pattern set in Birmingham
and other instances''.
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, however, claimed
that Mr Hanley was attempting to make cheap party political capital out
of the situation.
During the past three days, The Herald has revealed concern
surrounding a community business at Ferguslie Park, FCB Enterprise
Security Ltd, which is funded by Renfrew District Council, Strathclyde
Regional Council, and the Scottish Office. It is run by Labour Party
members.
Yesterday, its directors hit out at what they claimed was a smear
campaign against them by Mrs Adams. They claimed that FCB had been a
success story and provided employment for 80 people in an area of
deprivation.
Mr Hanley said: ''Mr Blair should recognise that the integrity of
local Labour Party organisation is coming seriously into question in a
way which, if confirmed, would prejudice the democratic process.
''There is only one correct response. He should today undertake to
institute independent and open inquiries into the instances of alleged
malpractice or intimidation in local Labour parties including
Birmingham, Bradford, Leicester, Tower Hamlets, as well as now in
Renfrew.''
Mr Robertson acknowledged that, while the allegations were very
serious, this was why Paisley North MP Irene Adams had taken the matter
immediately to the police and raised it in the Commons.
Mr Robertson said: ''These matters are under investigation and will be
resolved soon. Any additional membership-related matters will be
investigated at the same time. However, the Labour Party will not
investigate matters which properly come under the jurisdiction of the
police and other authorities.
''Jeremy Hanley is trying to make cheap party political capital out of
the situation (and) is even at odds with his colleague Allan Stewart,
who has said 'this is not a party-political issue but something everyone
should be concerned about'.''
The war of words between Mr Hanley and Mr Robertson came as it was
revealed yesterday that a senior council officer had expressed serious
concerns about the community business in a series of confidential
reports -- but decision-making Labour councillors continued to support
the company with contracts worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Yesterday, The Herald was handed confidential reports compiled by
Renfrew District Council's director of housing Mike Bailey which expose
a catalogue of problems with FCB. These reports, claim SNP group leaders
councillors Mr Bruce McFee and Mr Jim Mitchell, show ineptitude in
return for council funding of more than #690,000.
The first report dated April 7, 1992, reveals that the council
increased its payments to FCB from #152,900 a year to #234,400, plus a
further #68,600 for security at its Neighbourhood Offices.
Mr Bailey said he was extremely concerned that during 1991 there had
been 153 incidents in the Ferguslie Park area where persons were found
to be acting suspiciously, and in 27 of these incidents physical damage
had been caused.
There were a further 62 incidents of persons found to be involved in
glue abuse. The council's Neighbourhood Office also reported 18 repairs
to damage caused by vandalism. Yet only three of these incidents were
reported by FCB to Renfrew District Council and only five reported to
the police.
The second report dated April 14, 1992, reveals that the 22-member
ruling Labour group on the council had determined that FCB's ''single
tender would be in the best interests of the council and it would
promote community based employment''.
A further report, dated March 31, 1994, reveals that FCB won a new
council contract rated at #108,594 against three other security
companies to provide services for Renfrew District Council's
Neighbourhood Offices and specific areas within housing estates.
Last night, Mr McFee said the SNP group had been extremely concerned
about the activities of FCB and the money paid to them by Renfrew
District Council.
Mr Mitchell said: ''I am appalled to find today that there has not
been one weekly report since January, yet there has been no shortage of
bills.''
A spokesman for Renfrew District Council confirmed that they had
requested some ''retrospective reports'' from the company over the
contract.
Two local Labour councillors, Mrs Olga Clayton (Renfrew District
Council) and Mr Harry Revie (Strathclyde Regional Council) are members
of the firm's board of directors. Mr John McIntyre, co-ordinator of the
Ferguslie Park Partnership, is also a director of the group's holding
company and secretary of the Craigielea Ward Labour Party.
Yesterday, following an emergency FCB board meeting, Strathclyde
councillor Mr Revie criticised Mrs Adams.
He said: ''The allegations relating to the company are completely
without foundation,'' he said. ''An internal investigation has been
carried out and has found no evidence of criminal activity.''

FROM Hollywood, California, to Holywood, Dumfriesshire -- the crew of
the big-budget remake of the cult 1960s series Mission Impossible are
bound for Scotland.
A spokesman for the multi-million pound movie -- which stars
Oscar-winning actor Tom Cruise, fresh from his success in Interview With
The Vampire -- yesterday confirmed plans to shoot in the Dumfries area
in the next few weeks.
He said: ''We will be doing background shots but none of the cast will
be there, although I'm sure they are disappointed to be missing out on
some beautiful scenery.
''We are not 100% certain exactly what the filming will involve at the
moment.''
The shoot is thought to involve action filming on a train, in and
around a railway tunnel and signalbox on the Dumfries to Annan line,
possibly near the village of Holywood.
A spokeswoman for Railtrack Scotland, which is overseeing the shoot,
said: ''We are delighted that one of Scotland's most scenic rail routes
is to be the star of the show.''
The cast and crew are currently filming at Pinewood Studios, England,
where they have been since returning from location in Prague on April 1.
Co-starring in the new film are Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Emilio
Estevez, and Four Weddings And A Funeral star, Kristen Scott-Thomas.
The news was welcomed by Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council.
''For some time, we have been promoting the idea of the region as a
whole for film production. We are very pleased that such a major
production has come to us,'' a spokeswoman said.
The council has invested heavily in the South West Scotland Screen
Commission, which has been set up with the specific aim of attracting
film-making to the area.

THE governor of Peterhead Prison has ordered an investigation to
establish if a convicted rapist wrote a menacing letter threatening a
high-profile rape victim who has campaigned for tougher sentences.
The letter, sent to a newspaper last week, was allegedly written by
convicted rapist, John Cronin, threatening his victim, known only by her
first name, Judy. The author said he hated Judy and ''hoped to see her
again''.
The woman, who is married with four children and now lives in England,
was beaten by Cronin with a poker then assaulted. After the attack, she
decided to reveal her identity and press for justice reforms.
She described her ordeal to the 1993 Conservative Party conference,
after Cronin's life sentence was cut to six years.
Yesterday, she said the letter had given her a fright and she was now
keen to lower her public profile. Cronin is due for release next summer
after serving four years.
Judy said: ''What it did do was force the family to address the
question of how safe we will be next year when he gets out. It made me
realise how afraid I was.''
A spokeman for the Scottish Prison Service said the Peterhead
governor, Mr Alec Spencer, had ordered an investigation to establish if
Cronin or another prisoner was responsible for the letter.
He said Cronin could face disciplinary action if he was the author of
the letter.
Lothian and Borders police are also investigating.

THE master of a Spanish fishing trawler was fined #34,000 yesterday
for breaching European fishing regulations.
Luis Blanco Nosti was also ordered to pay #1200 costs by Plymouth
magistrates' chairman, Mr Roger Meyrick.
The court also ordered the trawler Chimbote to be detained in Plymouth
for three months or until the fine was paid.
The ship was detained south of the Isles of Scilly. Nosti pled guilty
to using nets with a smaller than permitted mesh, under-recording
megrim, anglerfish, and saithe, and not recording the correct mesh size.
He pleaded not guilty to three charges of failing to record in his log
his correct position in which he was fishing on April 10, 11, and 12.
The charges were dismissed by the court after prosecutor Erik
Salomonsen offered no evidence.
Nosti faced maximum fines totalling #65,000 on the charges. The court
ordered him to forfeit his catch, gear, and nets relating to the
offences.
The Chimbote's catch totalled more than five tonnes of fish worth an
estimated #14,480.
The prosecutor said European regulations were aimed at conserving fish
resources and were intended to provide a ''level playing field'' for
member states and their fishing industries.
The Chimbote was boarded by a party from the fisheries protection
vessel HMS Shetland on a routine patrol.
The trawler was on the first of six days permitted fishing in UK
waters. When the vessel's nets were hauled, they were found to be 70mm
-- 10mm less than permitted.
The log had recorded 300kg of megrim -- 243kg less than it should
have. The 780kg of anglerfish was 338kg less than was found.
The log recorded no saithe but 113.5kg of the fish was found on the
trawler.
Undersized fish were discovered in four boxes covered with octopus,
said the prosecutor.
There were 75.8kg of undersized megrim, and 58kg of witch flounder, he
said.
In Galway, Ireland, a year ago, Nosti was fined #200 for not carrying
a plan of the Chimbote's hold on board.
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave made it clear yesterday that
Spanish fishermen could expect no leniency if caught breaching fishing
laws.
He told BBC Radio: ''If they break the rules in British jurisdiction
we will deploy, as we have already, the fisheries protection squadron of
the Royal Navy to enforce those rules.''

THE repercussions of the Scottish local government elections continued
yesterday, as the Conservatives suffered their final humiliation -- when
their last chance of retaining power in any of Scotland's new unitary
authorities was lost to Labour.
However, there was also a blow to the Scottish Nationalists in the
North-east, where they were left out in the cold by a coalition deal
between Lib Dems and Independents.
Less than two weeks after the Tories' worst performance in a Scottish
election, they failed to win control in the new East Renfrewshire
council which is based on their flagship authority, Eastwood.
In a dramatic vote during the first meeting of the new council, Labour
group leader Councillor Owen Taylor was elected as convener of the new
authority by a majority of one, thanks to a Labour-Liberal Democrat pact
and an abstention by an Independent member.
A Labour nomination for Councillor Taylor, who is currently Labour
leader on Renfrew District Council, was supported by the eight Labour
members and two Liberal Democrats among the 20 East Renfrewshire
councillors.
This gave him 10 votes against nine for Tory councillor Ian Hutchison,
who was nominated by Conservative group leader Councillor Iain Drysdale,
the current Tory leader on Strathclyde Regional Council.
Crucially, Councillor Ian Pearce, the Independent representative for
the Netherlee ward, abstained in the knowledge that the Liberal
Democrats would support Labour.
Having kept his colleagues guessing until the last minute, he said
later that he had abstained because he has ''no political leanings'' and
not because he favoured Labour to the Conservatives.
Mr Pearce could have provided the Tories with a chance of taking
control on a cut of the cards if he had tied the votes at 10 apiece by
voting with the nine Tory members for Councillor Hutchison.
However, a pack of cards brought to the council chambers by Eastwood
chief executive Mr Michael Henry wasn't needed and Councillor Taylor
will serve as convener until the first meeting of the council on or
after April 1 next year, when the new authorities become effective.
Mr Jack McConnell, Scottish general secretary of the Labour Party,
described the result as a body blow for the Tories, in Eastwood MP Allan
Stewart's back yard.
''It now makes the Tory wipe-out in Scotland official, with not a
single Tory council left,'' he said.
The Conservatives warned that, as the biggest single group on the
council, they ''still called the shots'' and forecast that Labour would
not be able to push through decisions without their support. The Tories
plan to spend the next year lobbying to regain control of the council.
Meanwhile, farther north, the Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal
Democrats may be bedfellows on the Grampian Regional Council
administration, but there is no love lost between them on the new
Aberdeenshire Council.
The Liberal Democrats have joined forces with the Independents to form
the administration for the first year of the new authority and have been
accused by the Nationalists of being ''unprincipled opportunists who
would sell their granny to cling on to power''.
The Liberal Democrats took 15 seats on the new council, the same
number as the SNP, with the Independents taking 13 and the Conservatives
four.
The Liberal Democrats, who appointed Councillor Audrey Findlay as
their leader, had hoped to form a rainbow alliance but the Nationalists
refused to work alongside the Conservatives.
Then, 24 hours before yesterday's first meeting of the council, the
Liberal Democrats announced they had reached agreement with the
non-aligned councillors.
As a result, when yesterday's meeting was held in the current regional
council headquarters, Liberal Democrat Colin Millar was appointed
convener for the first year.
Last night, SNP councillor Jim Towers, the deputy chairman of Grampian
region's education committee, said he was amazed and amused by the
''astonishing turn of events which certainly shows up the Lib-Dems in
their true light''.

THE Prime Minister faces a strong recommendation to privatise nuclear
power following a 90-minute Cabinet committee meeting chaired by Trade
President Michael Heseltine yesterday.
The idea, backed by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who is in favour of a
#2000m privatisation plan, presents Mr Major with another difficult
decision. Yesterday, the Cabinet sub-committee decided to try to push
ahead with the privatisation of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear in
a bid to achieve what Margaret Thatcher's Energy Secretaries, Mr Cecil
Parkinson and Mr Jonn Wakeham, failed to provide.
The plan will not go to Cabinet today but Mr Major will have to make a
decision shortly.

ANOTHER gas attack struck hundreds of Japanese train passengers
yesterday, a month after the deadly nerve gas raid on the Tokyo
underground.
This time, nearly 400 people on a train and three platforms in
Yokohama suffered in the release of phosgene gas.
Phosgene is similar to the mustard gas used in the trenches in France
in the First World War.
A Yokohama Fire Department spokesman said the gas, made from a mixture
of carbon monoxide and chlorine,was highly toxic.
However, he said it was less deadly than the nerve gas sarin used in
the Tokyo outrage on March 20 which killed 12 and injured 5000.
The phosgene was released almost simultaneously in one train carriage
and in an underground passageway at Yokohoma's main railway station.
The train stopped at three stations before the alarm was raised.
Hundreds of security forces in gas masks rushed to the stations on a
line linking the port of Yokohama, Japan's second largest city, to Tokyo
16 miles away. Victims complained of burning eyes, sore throat, and
sickness, but none lost consciousness.
A police spokesman said 372 people were taken to hospitals and 22 were
detained.
Witnesses told police they saw ''a white liquid resembling paint
thinner'' spilled on the ground at Yokohama station by a young man.
One indication that the latest incident could be linked to the Tokyo
attack was that both sarin and phosgene were mentioned in a pamphlet
issued by the Supreme Truth doomsday cult, which is widely believed to
have been behind the attack in the capital.
The Aum Shinri Kyo cult swiftly issued a statement denying any
involvement in the Yokohama attack, as it did after the Tokyo one.
Police announced they had arrested the cult's deputy leader. Kiyohide
Hayakawa, 45, is second only to the sect's founder, Shoko Asahara, who
has so far eluded a huge manhunt.
Japan's security forces were just getting back to normal after
mounting their biggest peace-time operation at the weekend.
Thousands of police and military forces were mobilised because of a
prophecy by Asahara that the country was about to experience a disaster.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton warned last night that the ''evil cowards'' who
planted a car bomb which devastated a US government building in Oklahoma
City would be hunted down. The death toll fears ranged from 80 to 300.
The FBI issued an alert for three suspects. A local television station
said the FBI was hunting a brown Chevrolet truck with tinted windows.
Two of the passengers were said to be Middle Eastern, with dark hair and
beards.
Attorney General Janet Reno said 300 people working in the building
were unaccounted for. The official death toll at the time of her
disclosure stood at 20, including 17 children, but many more were feared
buried in the rubble.
At one emergency centre a medical worker said that only two of 80
people found so far had survived the blast. Hundreds were injured.
''We're sure that that (death toll) will go up because we've seen
fatalities in the building,'' Fire Chief Gary Marrs said.
Mr Clinton, his voice trembling at a nationally broadcast news
conference with Mrs Reno, declared a state of emergency in Oklahoma City
and vowed to send the world's best investigators after those responsible
for the bombings.
''These people are killers and must be treated like killers,'' Mr
Clinton said, adding that they would be found and ''justice will be
swift, certain and severe.''
Although he did not name any suspected groups or individuals, Mr
Clinton phrased his warning in international terms: ''The United States
will not tolerate and I will not allow the people of this country to be
intimidated by evil cowards.''
The director of US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Mr John
Magaw, explained how it happened. ''A vehicle was pulled up in front of
the building and it detonated shortly after 9 . . . and that it was
around 1000 to 1200 pounds''.
Mr Magaw said it was too early to indicate whether it was a suicide
attack or if the bomb had been detonated by remote control.
The children died in a day care centre in the Alfred Murrah building,
where at least 500 people worked, many of them from Federal agencies
fighting crime and terrorism.
Two of the children were burned beyond recognition. The bodies of the
rest, up to seven years old, were mangled.
Ten to 20 other children were unaccounted for late in the day. Heather
Taylor, an emergency worker, said she knew of only two who had survived.
One was in surgery, the other in intensive care.
''The day-care centre is totally gone,'' said Dr Carl Spengler, who
helped Ms Taylor with the victims.
It was on the second floor of the building, just above the spot where
the car bomb exploded. Toys and games were scattered amid broken glass
and other debris on the street.
One woman, her head swathed in bandages spattered with blood, drips of
red mingling with tears on her face, said she may have lost her two
young children and her husband. ''Whoever did that act, I hope you're
happy,'' she sobbed.
Police said about 58 people had been taken to hospital in critical
condition. Witnesses described horrible scenes of carnage, including
dismembered bodies and severely burned victims. Firefighters said they
could still hear cries of help from people trapped under the rubble.
A doctor said there were parts of dismembered bodies all over the
building. Another doctor had to amputate a woman's leg at the scene.
Mr Christopher Wright of the coastguard, one of those helping inside
the building, said rescuers periodically turned off their chainsaws and
prying tools to listen for calls of help, ''but we didn't hear anything
-- just death.''
He added: ''You're helpless really, when you see people two feet away,
you can't do anything, they're just smashed.''
The toll exceeded that in the February 1993 bomb at New York's World
Trade Centre where six people were killed and hundreds injured. It was
believed yesterday's blast was caused by a similar fertiliser-type bomb.
In 1920, a bomb blast in New York's Wall Street area killed 40 people
and injured hundreds. Authorities concluded it was the work of
''anarchists'' and came up with a list of suspects, but all had fled to
Russia.
The Oklahoma blast blew away an entire wall of the building, gutting
several floors and sending bullet-like glass shards flying through the
streets. The explosion was felt 30 miles away.
There were scenes of panic as bleeding and dazed people staggered from
the gutted building. Scores were treated at the scene, many as they lay
on the ground.
''I was just sitting at my desk and all of a sudden I just looked up
and everything came down,'' Delynda Casteel sobbed. ''I screamed and
ran.''
''People were out there in their underwear with glass and plaster over
their heads, faces and bodies,'' said state Representative Kevin Cox,
who was nearby when the blast occurred.
Mr Brian Espe, a vet with the Department of Agriculture, was working
on the fifth floor of the bombed building.
''I dived under a table,'' he said. ''When I came out I could see
daylight if I looked north and daylight if I looked west.''
Jennifer Delashaw, 18, was in bed at the Regency Tower Apartments, two
blocks away. Her friend Jesse Churchill went to the window after hearing
the boom and was blown across the room.
''I thought he got shot,'' said Ms Delashaw, who suffered cuts on her
legs and head. Mr Churchill was not seriously injured.
Carole Lawton, 62, a secretary, was sitting at her desk on the seventh
floor of the building when the explosion hit.
''All of a sudden the windows blew in,'' she said. ''It got real dark
and the ceiling just started coming down.'' She said she then heard
''the roar of the whole building crumbling.'' She managed to crawl down
some stairs.
Another worker said: ''I came out from under the desk and there just
wasn't any building left around me. Our whole office area is gone.''
City Mayor Ron Norick said the bomb left a crater in the street eight
feet deep.
The blast came soon after most of the 500 staff of the building
reached their offices.
''It's just body after body after body in there,'' said one rescuer at
the scene.
''Obviously no amateur did this,'' said Oklahoma Governor Frank
Keating. ''Whoever did this was an animal.''
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he was horrified by
the explosion.
He said in a statement he had been informed ''of the terrorist attack
in Oklahoma City today, and is following the situation closely.''
He said he was ''horrified at the loss of innocent lives, especially
of young children, caused by this cowardly attack'' and extended his
condolences to the families, President Clinton and the people of the
United States.
Several hours after the explosion people were still trapped in the
wrecked building.
''We have to crawl on our stomachs and feel our way and we're talking
to victims who are in there and reassuring them that we're doing
everything within the good Lord's power to reach them and get to them,''
Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen said.
As black smoke streamed across the city and glass, bricks and other
debris rained down, hospitals issued urgent calls for blood and for
medical teams to rush to the scene.
Cars in the area were set on fire and a large plume of black smoke
spread over the city of 450,000 people.
The blast caused security alerts across the United States with many
federal buildings evacuated.
The explosion occurred two years to the day after the government
attack on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, that killed 86
people, including about 30 children. A surviving Davidian in Texas (Waco
is about 250 miles from Oklahoma City) said that there was no connection
between the two events, apart from the coincidence of the date.
About half of the building was destroyed. It is across the street from
the federal courthouse in the city.
A local TV station said it received a phone call from someone saying
the US black Muslim organisation, the Nation of Islam, had claimed
responsibility.
However, the group denied it had any role in the blast.
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Mrs Reno had sent an FBI team
to the site and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta was to convene a
meeting to prepare a further federal response.
''Nothing is being ruled out,'' an FBI official said when asked if the
blast was being treated as a possible terrorist attack.
In Boston, hundreds of people were evacuated from a government
building because of a bomb threat after the blast.
The Foreign Office said night no Britons were believed to have been
injured in the blast.
